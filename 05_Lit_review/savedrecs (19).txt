Urbanization has changed the structure of the natural land surface and led to the intensification of the urban heat island (UHI) effect. This will affect the surface runoff temperature, which, in turn, will affect the surface water temperature of urban lakes. This study will use UAS TIR (un-manned aerial system thermal infrared radiance) remote sensing and in situ observation technology to monitor the urban space surface temperature and thermal runoff in Kunming, Yunnan, in summer; explore the feasibility of UAS TIR remote sensing to continuously observe urban surface temperature during day and night; and analyze thermal runoff pollution. The results of the study show that the difference between UAS TIR LSTs and in situ LSTs (in situ air temperature 10 cm above the ground.) varies with the type of land covers. Urban surface thermal runoff has varying degrees of impact on water bodies. Based on the influence of physical factors such as vegetation and buildings and meteorological factors such as solar radiation, the RMSE between UAS LSTs and in situ LSTs varies from 1 to 5 degrees C. Land cover types such as pervious bricks, asphalt, and cement usually show higher RMSE values. Before and after rainfall, the in situ data of the lake surface water temperature (LSWT) showed a phenomenon of first falling and then rising. The linear regression analysis results show that the R-2 of the daytime model is 0.92, which has high consistency; the average R-2 at night is 0.38; the averages R-2 before and after rainfall are 0.50 and 0.83, respectively; and the average RMSE is 1.94 degrees C. Observational data shows that thermal runoff quickly reaches thermal equilibrium with the land surface temperature about 30 min after rainfall. The thermal runoff around the lake has a certain warming effect on LSWT.

Chironomid-based palaeotemperature estimates for northeast Finland during Oxygen Isotope Stage 3	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Quantitative palaeotemperature estimates for the earlier part of Oxygen Isotope Stage (OIS-) 3 are inferred from subfossil chironomid remains. The high-latitudinal study site of Sokli, northeast Finland, provides for a unique lacustrine deposit covering the earlier part of OIS-3, and the chironomid remains found in the sediments show that a shallow lake with a diverse fauna was present at the study site throughout the record. Using a Norwegian calibration data set as a modern analogue, mean July air temperatures are reconstructed. The chironomid-inferred July air temperatures are surprisingly high, reaching values similar to the current temperature at the study site. Other proxies that were applied to the sediments included the analysis of botanical and zoological macro-remains, and our results concur with temperature estimates derived from climate indicator taxa. Summer temperatures for interstadial conditions, reconstructed with climate models, are as high as our proxy-based palaeotemperatures.					; Heiri, Oliver/JCE-4598-2023	Engels, Stefan/0000-0002-2078-0361; Heiri, Oliver/0000-0002-3957-5835; 													0921-2728					JUL	2008	40	1					49	61		10.1007/s10933-007-9133-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-007-9133-y													WOS:000257208600004

Concomitantly, controlling nutrient loadings has proven effective in reducing phytoplankton biomass especially in North America and Western Europe. In addition, the impact of invasive benthic filter-feeder species such as Corbicula on phytoplankton has largely been overlooked in large rivers, leading to even more uncertainty in predicting future trajectories in river water quality. To investigate how nutrient control, climate change and invasion of benthic filter-feeders may affect phytoplankton biomass and composition, we assembled a large database on the entire water course of the River Loire (France) over three decades (1991-2019). We focus on cyanobacteria to provide an in-depth analysis of the 30-year trend and insights on future possible trajectories. Since 1991, total phytoplankton and cyanobacteria biomasses have decreased 10-fold despite warmer water temperature (+0.23 degrees C.decade(-1)) and lower summer flow (-025 L.s(-1).km(-2).decade(-1)). In the long-term, the contribution of planktic cyanobacteria to total biomass was on average 2.8%. The main factors driving total phytoplankton and cyanobacteria biomasses were total phosphorus (4-fold decrease), the abundance of Corbicula clams (from absence before 1998 to 250-1250 individuals.m(-2) after 2010), the duration of summer low flows and the intensity of summer heatwaves. The River Loire constitutes an example in Europe of how nutrient control can be an efficient mitigation strategy, counteracting already visible effects of climate change on the thermal regime and flow pattern of the river. This may hold true under future conditions, but further work is needed to account for the climate trajectory. land and water use scenarios, the risk of enhanced benthic biofilm and macrophyte proliferation, together with the spread of invasive filter-feeding bivalves.

Three-spined stickleback armour predicted by body size, minimum winter temperature and pH	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Similar phenotypes evolve under equivalent environmental conditions through parallel evolution. Because they have repeatedly invaded and adapted to new freshwater environments, the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) offers a powerful system for understanding the agents of selection in nature that drive parallel evolution. Here, we examine the ecological and environmental variables responsible for morphological variation in three-spined stickleback populations across its European range. We collected fish from 85 populations, encompassing much of the European latitudinal range of the species and including lowland rivers and lakes, coastal lagoons and moorland ponds. We measured biotic and environmental variables at all sites along with morphological traits for 2,358 individuals. Using an information theory approach, we identified body size, minimum average winter temperature and pH as primary predictors of stickleback armour evolution, challenging current hypotheses for stickleback morphological diversification and demonstrating the fundamental role played by body size and scaling in mediating responses to selection. Stickleback lateral plate phenotype represents a potentially powerful tool for monitoring change in climate variables across the northern temperate region.

Here, we focused on Lake Saimaa landlocked salmon (Sahno Aar m. sehago) and studied the role of the early rearing environment in trait formation by comparing juveniles (fingerlings) from three backgrounds: (i) semi-wild (stocked as alevins), (ii) standard hatchery, and (iii) enriched hatchery conditions We compared juvenile morphology, swimming performance, and capability of feeding on natural prey in early winter. We found no differences between standard and enriched hatchery conditions. Semi-wild fish consumed more prey items, but wet mass of stomach contents did not differ among backgrounds. Swimming endurance was comparable among backgrounds. Semi-wild fish had slenderer body shape and longer fins than hatchery-reared fish. The lack of performance differences between hatchery juveniles and their semi-wild conspecifics is possibly due to reduced phenotypic plasticity caused by extremely low levels of genetic diversity in this population.					; Vitelletti, Maria Letizia/AAE-5304-2022; Kortet, Raine/J-5027-2012	Huuskonen, Hannu/0000-0001-5609-768X; Vitelletti, Maria Letizia/0000-0001-9653-5429; Kortet, Raine/0000-0003-3749-1096													0706-652X	1205-7533				APR	2020	77	4					770	778		10.1139/cjfas-2019-0079	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2019-0079													WOS:000522818800013

Chironomid larvae are an important paleo-proxy because, in addition to their environmental sensitivity, their chitinous cephalic capsules are well preserved in lacustrine sediments, allowing their recovery and identification. We analysed the effects of a recent volcanic eruption (Puyehue-Cordon Caulle Volcanic Complex 2011) on the chironomid community based on their cephalic remains accumulated following the ash deposition process. Two pulses of ash deposition were distinguished: a first stage comprising the immediate coarse ash fall and a delayed finer volcanic deposition. An abrupt decline in chironomid taxa and their densities were noted during the first coarse pulse, followed by an attempt of community recovery through the second finer pulse, characterised by main taxa turnover, observing an alternative community functional structure. Based on these results and comparing with past volcanic depositions, we observed different chironomid responses according to their particular ecological habits, and we noted possible percolation effects, mainly in coarse tephras, and probably a delayed record of very low abundance taxa. Our results suggest caution in analysing chironomid assemblages within and adjacent to tephra deposition as local volcanic eruption could affect chironomid community with possible consequences on paleoreconstructions.					; Guevara, Sergio/I-9241-2019; Williams, Naty/JED-3935-2023	Ribeiro Guevara, Sergio/0000-0001-7203-7687; 													0028-8330	1175-8805				JUL 2	2024	58	3					440	464		10.1080/00288330.2023.2237422	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.2023.2237422		JUL 2023											WOS:001034872000001
J	BELLO, R; SMITH, JD				BELLO, R; SMITH, JD			THE EFFECT OF WEATHER VARIABILITY ON THE ENERGY-BALANCE OF A LAKE IN THE HUDSON-BAY LOWLANDS, CANADA	ARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Evaporation is an important component of the water balance of lakes in the Hudson Bay Lowlands, but the amount of summer evaporation in this area is not well known. Hourly summertime estimates of evaporation, from a small tundra lake near Churchill, Manitoba, are compared to equilibrium evaporation estimates of the Penman model. For the entire measurement period .alpha. = 1.35. For individual days .alpha. ranges from 1.0 to 2.0 and for individual hours from 1.0 to 4.0. Local advection is primarily responsible for the large fluxes of latent heat. The latent heat flux exceeds available radiant energy over the summer, with temperature inversions occurring over the lake on the majority of days. The advective enhancement of lake evaporation responds to daily weather variations. The classification of these variations will improve operational estimates of lake evaporation.																			0004-0851					FEB	1990	22	1					98	107		10.2307/1551724	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1551724													WOS:A1990CQ32100009

Late Quaternary Environments in the Nile Basin	NILE: ORIGIN, ENVIRONMENTS, LIMNOLOGY AND HUMAN USE	Monographiae Biologicae											The Late Quaternary history of the Nile has been reconstructed using well-dated sedimentary, stable isotope and fossil records and associated archaeological remains. The White Nile flows over the bed of an ancient lake dating to similar to 400 ka (Marine Isotope Stage 11). High flood levels in the White Nile since that time appear to coincide with times of sapropel accumulation in the eastern Mediterranean. During times of aridity, the most recent phase being roughly coeval with the Last Glacial Maximum, the large lakes in Uganda either dried out or were too low to provide flow into the White Nile, which became a highly seasonal river, as did the main Nile. The sediments of Lake Albert, from where the White Nile starts its long journey to the Mediterranean, preserve critical evidence on the discharge history of this river. The lake's sedimentary record confirms the coincidence between overflow of Lake Victoria and reestablishment of flow in the White Nile north of Khartoum at similar to 14.5 ka and also shows a lake low-stand at similar to 4.2 ka that, by cutting off flow to the White Nile, may have contributed to the fall of Egypt's Old Kingdom. The modern hydrological regime in the Nile was thus re-established at similar to 14.5ka, with strengthening of the summer monsoon and overflow from Lake Victoria. A modest number of calibrated radiocarbon ages on White Nile gastropod shells indicate that White Nile levels were high around 14.7-13.1 ka, 9.7-9.0, 7.9-7.6, 6.3 and 3.2-2.8 ka. The Blue Nile and main Nile flood records, albeit less complete, accord with those of the White Nile. Preliminary OSL ages obtained by us from the upper 2 m of dunes west of the White Nile and main Nile show discrete phases of Holocene dune activity that seem to correlate with at least three of six significant periods of rapid global climatic change during 9-8, 6-5, 4.2-3.8, 1.2-1.0 and 0.6-0.15 ka, the first five of which coincided with polar cooling and tropical aridity. The intervals in between were wetter in the tropics and, allowing for dating errors, tally reasonably well with the intervals of high White Nile floods identified here.																			0077-0639		978-1-4020-9725-6				2009	89						61	72				10.1007/978-1-4020-9726-3												WOS:000270040800004
J	Kim, SH; Tanaka, Y; Kashima, K				Kim, Song-Hyun; Tanaka, Yukiya; Kashima, Kaoru			The history of palaeoflood and palaeoclimate recorded in the flood deposits of the Kherlen River, Mongolia	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												This study examines the 1500-year history of massive floods as recorded in the slackwater deposits of the Kherlen River basin in Mongolia. The study area is located along the Kherlen River in Baganuur district, Ulaanbaatar. Site HL1 has a flood frequency of 89 years and an accumulation rate of 1.2 mm/y over approximately 1500 years. Site HL2 has a flood frequency of 72.2 years and an accumulation rate of 1.46 mm/y during about 700 years. The range of calculated value for flood frequency and annual accumulation rate during the period of the 10th century to the early 20th century at site HL1 is entirely different from that in other periods. It is considered that the palaeohydrological environment of the study site during that time might have been influenced by climatic change as well as geomorphological and hydrological change. Based on the results of identification of discrete flooding and age dating (Cs-137 and C-14), the sedimentary layers of HL1 and HL2 were divided into 4 periods (period 1: 1960-2012, period 2: 970-1960, period 3: 533-970, period 4: 427-533) and 2 periods (period 1: 1960-2012, period 2: 1290-1960), respectively. The authors suggest that the past climate of the region was greatly influenced by the East Asia summer monsoon. It is suggested that the occurrence of the large-scale floods in eastern Mongolia was influenced by the strengthening and weakening of the summer monsoon due to climate change.

A total of 208 fish were necropsied and 5652 worms were recovered, of which 2392 were from 87 infected male fish and 3260 were from 89 infected female fish. Prevalence values varied from 50% to 95%. The intensity and abundance of nematodes fluctuated over the study period and are statistically significant (F=14.87, P < 0.0001), and showed a seasonal preference for the summer period (F=33.39, P < 0.05). The mean intensity was the highest in the smallest size group at 66.3 +/- 12.7 which gradually decreased to 4 +/- 1.89 in the largest size group. No significant differences were found between parasites from male and female hosts, except in the summer. Male parasites were less abundant in the population. Female worms were grouped into immature, maturing and gravid and all these stages were present throughout the year. The highest occurrence of both immature and gravid P. daccai was found during the months of February to April each year. Peak recruitment seems to occur during this period due to the presence of high quantities of immature worms.																			0022-149X	1475-2697				DEC	2005	79	4					339	343		10.1079/JOH2005289	http://dx.doi.org/10.1079/JOH2005289								16336718					WOS:000233825700008

A comparative analysis of subsurface and ecological factors	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Lakes are recognized as important sources of greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions to the atmosphere, influenced by various ecological processes. Groundwater discharge into lakes, despite its small volume, has high concentrations of dissolved carbon and nitrogen that significantly affect the production and emission of GHGs from lakes. Therefore, a comprehensive investigation of the mechanisms behind lake GHGs emissions under the influence of groundwater discharge and ecological processes, holds substantial scientific importance. However, due to uncertainties and quantification challenges associated with groundwater discharge, related research is currently limited. Here, we conducted year-round field observations on Honghu Lake, a large shallow eutrophic lake in Hubei Province, China. We analyzed the seasonal variation of GHGs emissions and quantified the groundwater discharge flux using radon (222Rn). The fluxes of methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and nitrous oxide (N2O) at the water-air interface were estimated to be 31.1 f 4.88 mg m- 2 d- 1, 386 f 90.7 mg m- 2 d- 1, and 0.327 f 0.072 mg m- 2 d- 1, respectively. CH4 is the primary greenhouse gas in Honghu Lake, contributing to 82.2 % and 62.2 % of the lake's total emissions over 20-year and 100-year frames. The average rate of groundwater discharge was 8.19 f 0.471 mm d-1, with the highest discharge rate in winter and the lowest in spring. The daily groundwater discharge volume accounts for 0.649 % of the lake's total water volume. The daily contributions of groundwater discharge to the lake's total emissions of CH4, CO2, and N2O were 0.318%, 12.1 %, and 2.59 %, respectively. The facilitative role of groundwater discharge in CO2 emissions primarily manifests through the transport of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and high concentrations of CO2 into the lake. Meanwhile, CH4 emissions depend on the activity of methanogenic bacteria, substrate availability, and anaerobic conditions, whereas N2O emissions are influenced by temperature and nutrient levels. Our study reveals that in the short term, the effect of groundwater on lakes is relatively minimal. Yet, its long-term role as a steady supplier of carbon and nutrients to lakes should not be overlooked. This study reveals the ways in which groundwater discharge and internal lake dynamics collectively fuel GHGs emissions. Our findings offer a new perspective and critical theoretical support for the assessment of lake greenhouse gas emissions.

The major lipid classes in all samples were polar lipids (including phospholipid, glycolipid and chlorophyll) and triacylglycerol, with lesser proportions of free fatty acids. Total lipid increased through November and early December, reaching a maximum (3300 mg m-2 at Cape Armitage and 1800 mg m-2 at Erebus Ice Tongue) c. one week after the chlorophyll a maxima. This increase was largely attributable to a corresponding increase in triacylglycerol. At the lipid maxima triacylglycerol/polar lipid ratios in the range 1.0 to 2.5 wer observed. The dynamic variations in lipid class abundances indicate that profound changes in the physiology of sea-ice diatoms are occurring throughout the spring bloom. A range of sterols (C26-C30) were detected; 24-methylenecholesterol, brassicasterol and 24-ethylcholesterol were the major sterols at the Cape Armitage and Erebus sites. The similarity of the sterol profiles to those of Antarctic freshwater algal communities strongly indicates diatoms as a more probable source of C29 sterols in the freshwater lakes than cyanobacteria or other algal groups. The hydrocarbons isoated from sea-ice diatoms at all sites were dominated by two unsaturated components, n-C21:6 and a diunsaturated isoprenoid C25 alkene. Until this study, no biological source had been validated for the isoprenoid C25:2 diene, even though it has been detected in many estuarine and coastal sediments.

Here, we present a pollen-based reconstruction of vegetation history and associated climate variations of a sediment core from Huangqihai Lake, central Inner Mongolia. During 10.7 to 8.8 cal kaBP, typical steppe with small patches of forest dominated the lake area, suggesting a moderately wet climate, followed by ameliorating climatic conditions until 8.0 cal kaBP as deduced by the expansion of forest. Typical steppe recovered the lake area between 8.0 and 7.2 cal kaBP, reflecting a deterioration of climatic conditions; in combination with other proxy records in the study region, we noticed that severe aridity was prevailed in the lake area between 8.0 and 7.6 cal kaBP. During 7.2 to 3.2 cal kaBP, abundant tree pollen indicated dominance of forest-steppe around the lake, marking regionally wet conditions. A notable absence of broadleaved trees after 5.2 cal kaBP reveals a slight drying trend, and climate deterioration from 4.5 to 4.1 cal kaBP might be linked to the 4.2 ka event. After 3.2 cal kaBP, a transition to steppe was associated with dry conditions in the region. Based on our pollen record and prior paleoclimatic reconstructions in the Huangqihai Lake region, there was a generally-accepted, stepwise shift to a wet climate during the early Holocene, an overall humid climate from 7.2 to 3.2 cal kaBP, and then severe drought for the rest of the Holocene. Moreover, regional comparisons among pollen records derived from lakes situated in the temperate steppe region suggested a roughly synchronous pattern of vegetation and climate changes during the Holocene and demonstrated an intensified EASM during the middle Holocene.																			1000-9515	1755-6724				AUG	2020	94	4					1178	1186		10.1111/1755-6724.14565	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1755-6724.14565													WOS:000566569400019
J	Theron, CB				Theron, Cleo Beth			Imprints of Indigenes and the Optics of Settlement: A Bifocal Reading of Summer on the Lakes and A Millimetre of Dust	ENGLISH STUDIES IN AFRICA												This article is a comparative reading of Margaret Fuller's Summer on the Lakes, in 1843 (1844) and Julia Martin's A Millimetre of Dust: Visiting Ancestral Sites (2008), travelogues that explore erstwhile frontier zones in view of a changing social landscape inflected with the rhetoric of democracy. The comparison is based on the thematic parallels between literature from the American Renaissance and post-apartheid South Africa in which the landscape is portrayed in metonymic relation to the nation. Drawing on the field of world literature and the notion that texts might undergo transformation in the way they are interpreted due to their movement across space and time, the article employs a 'bifocal' lens that produces a contrapuntal engagement between mid-nineteenth century America and post-apartheid South Africa.

A concentration of chlorophyll, phytoplankton biomass and concentrations of different phosphorus forms were also used in interpretations. In Lake Erken bacterioplankton had low abundance and productivity in July - during the increase of phytoplankton biomass. A chlorophyll maximum occurred in early August, possibly overcoming the deficiency of inorganic phosphorus through the synthesis of extracellular alkaline phosphatases. The peak and subsequent decline of phytoplankton caused the synthesis of bacterial hydrolytic enzymes to begin in this successive order alkaline phosphatase, leucine aminopeptidase and beta-glucosidase. Newly available substrates made a higher productivity of bacterioplankton possible in the middle of August.

In spite of the fact that the density of nauplii differed by a factor up to five between years, the density of adults showed very small annual variations, indicating a definite carrying capacity of adult H. saliens. The adult populations also were of the same size in both lakes. The Heterocope-nauplii hatch from resting eggs during spring and the circulation seem to be the triggering force for the hatching process. The numbers of nauplii correlated with the intensity of vernal circulation and the vertical distribution indicated no nauplii below the deepest strata to circulate. Unhatched eggs did not seem to hatch a subsequent spring with complete circulation. An egg production of up to 170 eggs per female were estimated, higher numbers than previously reported for Heterocope-species.																			0003-9136					JUL	1987	110	1					83	99																WOS:A1987J539700006

Maxima in precipitation amount and frequency are associated with the afternoon-to-evening precipitation regime at approximately 60% of the stations in the network. CMORPH data also capture this pattern, but miss the late morning peak that occurs at some stations. The timing of maximum occurrence agrees well with the diurnal cycle of synoptic conditions favouring the development of precipitation over this area. There is no distinct west-to-east propagation of the diurnal cycle, implying that the diurnal cycle is more driven by local effects than by large-scale circulation. It turns out that the diurnal cycle in precipitation frequency depends largely on topography and landscape. The geographical transition in precipitation peak time is distinct from hilly regions (daytime peak) towards lakes and valleys (evening-to-nocturnal peaks). Stations located in mountainous regions (valleys) tend to experience more precipitation in either late morning or early afternoon (late afternoon or evening). Overall, precipitation amount shows a similar topographic dependence, as does the precipitation frequency, suggesting that local-scale effects, such as the mountain valley circulation effect, has a great impact on the diurnal variation in precipitation when large-scale dynamical processes are weak. A possible mechanism for the non-uniform diurnal cycle of precipitation over the TP is proposed. The major conclusion is that plateau-scale synoptic systems, as well as local circulation systems caused by the complex topography, should be taken into account when determining the diurnal variation in precipitation over the TP.

We have carried out a rock magnetic study on two deep-sea sediment cores from the Pacific coast Pescadero Basin. The magnetic intensities estimate total magnetic material and are a proxy for total clastic sediment. Ratios of magnetic intensities estimate the grain size of magnetic material. The rock magnetic data show a decimeter scale, multi-decadal oscillation with fourteen cycles (A-N) over the last 1200 years. These oscillations reflect alternating intervals of stronger/coarser magnetic/clastic flux to the coastal ocean and intervals of weaker/finer magnetic flux. We think these variations are caused by variations in long-term dominance of the NAM; summer (wet) monsoons produce rainy conditions (with runoff) while winter (dry) monsoons produce significant offshore winds, increased upwelling/biological productivity. We can correlate our variability to two other published studies southeast of Pescadero Basin, coastal lake sediments in Laguna de Juanacatlan and a Juxtlahuaca Cave stalagmite. Both of these studies estimate local rainfall. We see evidence of the same pattern of multi-decadal rainfall-runoff variability in these records as we see in Pescadero Basin, which is synchronous to within +/- 25 years over the last 1200 years. The multi-dacadal pattern of hydrologic variability in all three records varies in cycle duration from similar to 90-years wet/dry cycles in the Little Ice Age (1400-1850 AD) to similar to 60-years cycles in the Medieval Climate Optimum (1100-1400 AD). This variability in cycle duration suggests some chaotic nature to the regional NAM climate pattern or some long-term non-linear forcing (PDO?).

Studies on the hydro-climatic evolution during the Late Quaternary were mainly carried out by single lake records or alternatively by individual terrestrial sites. Integrated source-to sink studies considering lake-catchment interactions were extremely seldom utilized. We investigated such relationships in the Kuhai Basin on the north-eastern Tibetan Plateau and analysed sedimentary processes based on 30 onshore sections and three sediment cores from different locations and water depth in the lake basin. Grain size variations, ostracod assemblages, geochemical proxies and absolute dating (luminescence, radiocarbon, Pb-210/Cs-137) were applied as key indicators that reveal interacting sediment fluxes under different hydro-climatic settings during the Younger Dryas interval and the Holocene. Our results indicate that wind-induced transportation processes and allocation of respective aeolian sands in the catchment are attributed to distinct phases of reduced effective moisture availability during summer time. Those phases corresponded to weak summer monsoon influence during the Younger Dryas interval, the Early Holocene (11.6-7.5 ka), dry-cold interlude (DCI: ca. 4.5-3.0 ka), Dark Ages Cold Period (DACP: ca. 1.8-1.1 ka) and the Little Ice Age (LIA: ca. 0.6-0.1 ka). Contemporaneous low lake levels during these periods corresponded with respective aeolian sand flux and variable composition of mixed sediments (fluvial and aeolian) in lake deposits. Different flux rates at the core sites could be assigned to local conditions in respect to inflow behaviour of individual drainage systems and nearshore morphology. Aeolian deposits in the catchment were not always preserved and underwent re -mobilisation during succeeding episodes and/or erosion during phases of high water availability. Wetter climatic conditions during the Mid -Holocene (ca. 7.5-5.1 ka), Roman Warm Period (RWP: ca. 2.8-1.5 ka) and Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA: ca. 0.9-0.6 ka) revealed significant lake level rise due to enhanced river discharge, well documented by highest suspended flux rates, disappearance of ostracod communities at core sites and very low sand input. Climate shifts during the Holocene were linked to variations in effective moisture supply under the influence of the Asian summer monsoon (ASM) and the interplay with the mid-latitude westerlies (MLW). Cold-dry phases were likely a response to North Atlantic climatic anomalies transmitted by the MLW across the TP. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Low up to the end of the 60's when the lake was oligotrophic, high during the 80's when the lake was eutrophic and in diminution now with the reoligotrophication of Lake Geneva. The diminution of the actual growth is mainly significant for the females.

In the context of short-term (monthly to seasonal) water management, predicting these supply variations well in advance are essential in advocating appropriate conservation measures before the onset of drought. In this study, we utilized 3-month ahead probabilistic multimodel streamflow forecasts developed using climatic information-sea surface temperature conditions in the tropical Pacific, tropical Atlantic, and over the North Carolina coast-to invoke restrictions for Falls Lake Reservoir in the Neuse River Basin, N.C. Multimodel streamflow forecasts developed from two single models, a parametric regression approach and semiparametric resampling approach, are forced with a reservoir management model that takes ensembles to estimate the reliability of meeting the water quality and water supply releases and the end of the season target storage. The analyses show that the entire seasonal releases for water supply and water quality uses could be met purely based on the initial storages (100% reliability of supply), thereby limiting the use of forecasts. The study suggests that, by constraining the end of the season target storage conditions being met with high probability, the climate information based streamflow forecasts could be utilized for invoking restrictions during below-normal inflow years. Further, multimodel forecasts perform better in detecting the below-normal inflow conditions in comparison to single model forecasts by reducing false alarms and missed targets which could improve public confidence in utilizing climate forecasts for developing proactive water management strategies.

Economic Values and Regional Economic Impacts of Recreational Fisheries in Mississippi Reservoirs	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												This study estimated the economic benefit of recreational fisheries on two trophy crappie Pomoxis spp. fisheries in Mississippi. We accomplished this by estimating economic impacts of angler expenditures and angler willingness-to-pay for fishing trips above current expenditures. Anglers spent 91,811 activity days on Sardis Reservoir in 2006 and 46,036 on Grenada Reservoir in 2007. The total economic impacts to the state were estimated at US$5.83 million on Sardis Reservoir and $2.15 million on Grenada Reservoir, supporting 75 and 51 full- and part-time jobs, respectively. Total consumer surplus was $5.57 million and $4.46 million on Sardis and Grenada reservoirs, respectively. Last, we used a model that predicted the effect of average spring water levels on total angling effort to estimate resulting changes in economic benefits. Spring angling effort and associated economic benefits peaked at intermediate water levels and declined at both low and high water levels. Future changes in precipitation patterns in the southeastern United States may require altering reservoir guide curves to maximize economic benefits associated with reservoir fisheries.

J	Güler, C; Thyne, GD				Güler, C; Thyne, GD			Hydrologic and geologic factors controlling surface and groundwater chemistry in Indian Wells-Owens Valley area, southeastern California, USA	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The Indian Wells-Owens Valley area is located in the semi-arid Basin and Range province, which is characterized by alternating mountains and alluvial basins. Surface water resources are limited in this and region and water demand is mainly met by groundwater pumpage. In a classic Basin and Range groundwater system, water flows from recharge areas in the mountains to discharge areas in adjacent valleys. Discharge areas are generally occupied by playas where large amounts of salt deposition occur due to evaporating groundwater. Hydrochemical data from a total of 1368 spring, surface, and well water samples collected over an 80-year period were used to evaluate water quality and to determine processes that control water chemistry. Q-mode hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was employed for partitioning the water samples into hydrochemical facies, also known as water groups or water types. Five major water groups resulted from the HCA analysis. The samples from the area were classified as recharge area waters (Ca-Na-HCO3 water and Na-Ca-HCO3 water), transition zone waters (Na-HCO3-Cl water), and discharge area waters (Na-Cl water and more concentrated Na-Cl water). Spatial plots of the major statistical groups show that the samples that belong to the same group are located in close proximity to one another suggesting the same processes and/or flowpaths. Inverse geochemical models of the statistical groups were developed using PHREEQC to elucidate the chemical reactions controlling water chemistry. The inverse geochemical modeling demonstrated that relatively few phases are required to derive water chemistry in the area. In a broad sense, the reactions responsible for the hydrochemical evolution in the area fall into four categories: (1) silicate weathering reactions; (2) dissolution of salts; (3) precipitation of calcite, amorphous silica, and clay minerals; and (4) ion exchange.

Specifically, we focus on the Nivlisen ice shelf in East Antarctica, examining melt ponds, supra glacial lakes (SGLs), seasonal surface melt extent, and surface ice flow velocity. Spatial and temporal analysis is based on Landsat and Sentinel-1 data from the austral summers of 2000 to 2023. Between 2000 and 2014, melt ponds and SGLs on the ice shelf covered roughly 1 km2. However, from 2015 to 2023, surface melting increased consistently, leading to more extensive melt ponds and SGLs. Significant SGL depths were observed in 2016, 2017, 2019, and 2020, with 2008, 2016, and 2020 showing the highest volumes and progressive SGL area growth. We also examined the relationship between seasonal surface melt extent and ice flow velocity. Validation efforts involved ground truth data from a melt pond in central Dronning Maud Land (cDML) during the 2022-2023 austral summer, along with model-based results. The observed increase in melt pond depth and volume may significantly impact ice shelf stability, potentially accelerating ice flow and ice shelf destabilization. Continuous monitoring is essential for accurately assessing climate change's ongoing impact on Antarctic ice shelves.					; M, Geetha/L-5090-2016	SIVALINGAM, SIVARANJANI/0009-0001-4881-3719; 														2072-4292				DEC	2023	15	24							5676	10.3390/rs15245676	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs15245676													WOS:001130645200001
J	Romanescu, G; Stoleriu, CC				Romanescu, Gheorghe; Stoleriu, Cristian Constantin			Anthropogenic interventions and hydrological-risk phenomena in the fluvial-maritime delta of the Danube (Romania)	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												The Danube Delta represents the most important wetland of Europe and the manifestation area of periodical spring-summer floods. The hydrotechnical works executed in the Danube Delta between 1950 and 1990 were meant to protect the localities against floods and to facilitate the fluvial transport. For rapid access to the locality of Caraorman (for the exploitation of quartziferous sand) and to the Rosu touristic complex, the Crisan-Caraorman channel was oversized (12 km long, 60-70 m wide, with a maximum depth of 4-6 m). The access mouth of the channel in the Sulina arm and the outlets towards the Black Sea of the deltaic lacustrine complex were poorly designed. The aggradation of the channel determined the increase in the solid discharged carried by the water and the accentuation of the alluvia accumulated in lakes. To facilitate the transit of the fluvial waters towards the Black Sea, a weir was built at the mouth of Lake Rosulet (1.20 m r MNS). Unfortunately, the weir is too high, and the water level within the lacustrine complex increases alarmingly during floods. This is why the locality of Caraorman - situated 25 km away from the Black Sea - becomes flooded. That is, there is an increase in the phreatic level (the localities of Sulina and St. George are also affected but not to the same extent). The topographic and bathymetric measurements and the precise positioning of the targeted critical points (GPS) served as the methods for investigating the deltaic area affected by flooding. The causes of the backwater floods were identified, and the measures of an adequate management plan were set out. To eliminate this impediment, alterations to the hydrotechnical works must be made as follows: reducing the height of the existing weir and building two other weirs with lower crests; dredging the secondary channels and the lacustrine cuvettes; and using shallow-draft ships. The lack of funds and the apathy of the habilitated institutions delays the implementation of the necessary measures. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Nasimi, M; Wood, RL				Nasimi, Mitra; Wood, Richard L.			Using Deep Learning and Advanced Image Processing for the Automated Estimation of Tornado-Induced Treefall	REMOTE SENSING												Each year, numerous tornadoes occur in forested regions of the United States. Due to the substantial number of fallen trees and accessibility issues, many of these tornadoes remain poorly documented and evaluated. The process of documenting tree damage to assess tornado intensity is known as the treefall method, an established and reliable technique for estimating near-surface wind speed. Consequently, the demand for documenting fallen trees has increased in recent years. However, the treefall method proves to be extremely expensive and time-consuming, requiring a laborious assessment of each treefall instance. This research proposes a novel approach to evaluating treefall in large, forested regions using deep learning-based automated detection and advanced image processing techniques. The developed treefall method relies on high-resolution aerial imagery from a damaged forest and involves three main steps: (1) instance segmentation detection, (2) estimating tree taper and predicting fallen tree directions, and (3) obtaining subsampled treefall vector results indicating the predominant flow direction in geospatial coordinates. To demonstrate the method's effectiveness, the algorithm was applied to a tornado track rated EF-4, which occurred on 10 December 2021, cutting through the Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area in Kentucky. Upon observation of the predicted results, the model is demonstrated to accurately predict the predominant treefall angles. This deep-learning-based treefall algorithm has the potential to speed up data processing and facilitate the application of treefall methods in tornado evaluation.

J	Mocq, J; Hare, L				Mocq, Julien; Hare, Landis			Influence of Acid Mine Drainage, and Its Remediation, on Lakewater Quality and Benthic Invertebrate Communities	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												The abandoned Aldermac Mine in Quebec, Canada, has been a source of acid mine drainage to Lake Arnoux since 1946. Restoration of the site was undertaken in 2008 and completed in 2010. We compared lakewater chemistry and benthic invertebrate communities in the spring of 2010, prior to complete restoration, and in spring 2011, when acid mine drainage was no longer entering the lake. Between these years, lakewater pH increased by about one unit and the concentrations of many trace metals declined substantially. In 2010, benthic taxonomic richness increased significantly with distance from the source of contamination, whereas after restoration, there was no longer a clear trend. Communities in highly contaminated stations tended to be dominated by burrowing taxa such as larvae of Chironomus (Chironomidae) and Oligochaeta, whereas less contaminated stations had taxonomic and functional communities that were more diverse. In the year following recovery, some new taxa appeared (Trichoptera, Odonata, and the Ceratopogonidae Bezzia), whereas the populations of an acid-tolerant Chironomus species declined. However, only larger individuals exhibited a significant response to pH and metal contamination.

J	Becker, S; Richl, P; Ernst, A				Becker, Sven; Richl, Petra; Ernst, Anneliese			Seasonal and habitat-related distribution pattern of Synechococcus genotypes in Lake Constance	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												The abundance and distribution of Synechococcus spp. in the autotrophic picoplankton of Lake Constance, were followed in the pelagic and littoral habitat by qPCR over 2 years. One genotype, represented by isolated phycoerythrin-rich strain BO 8807, showed a seasonal distribution pattern in both habitats. Before a stable thermal stratification, the maximum of both the Synechococcus population and genotype BO 8807 occurred at 15 or 20 m water depth in the pelagic habitat. During the summer stratification, when the absolute abundance of all Synechococcus spp. was highest above 15 m, the absolute and relative abundance of genotype BO 8807 was maximal at 20 m. These results indicate that Synechococcus spp. or single genotypes are present in deep maxima in Lake Constance. The in situ dynamics of genotype BO 8807 is consistent with the observation that isolated strain BO 8807 requires higher phosphate concentrations for maximum growth rates than a strain from the same phylogenetic cluster that dominates the pelagic summer population. In contrast to these findings, low genome numbers of phycocyanin-rich genotype BO 8805 were found temporarily only in both the littoral and pelagic plankton. Microscopy revealed that PC-rich cells in general occurred preferentially in the littoral habitat. We discuss our results with respect to the versatility of picocyanobacteria of the evolutionary lineage VI of cyanobacteria, and a habitat-related distribution pattern of Synechococcus genotypes.

J	Havel, JE; Pattinson, KR				Havel, JE; Pattinson, KR			Spatial distribution and seasonal dynamics of plankton in a terminal multiple-series reservoir	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Despite several decades of research on eutrophication in lakes, changes in reservoir plankton communities are poorly understood. The current study examined spatial patterns and dynamics of algae and zooplankton in an oligomesotrophic main-stem reservoir, Bull Shoals Lake, Missouri-Arkansas, which is currently threatened from rapid development in upstream reservoirs. Eighteen sites were sampled during one week in summer and the seasonal dynamics of algae and zooplankton were followed at two of these sites. The lake showed strong spatial patterning in transparency, concentrations of phosphorus and chlorophyll-a, and densities of algae and zooplankton. Algal composition also varied substantially among sites, with cyanobacteria most abundant in up-reservoir and tributary sites. Although cyanobacteria were most abundant in late summer, appreciable densities were found throughout the year. Zooplankton were dominated by rotifers and cladocerans, which showed large oscillations in density over time. Abundance peaks occurred earlier in an up-reservoir than in a down-reservoir site, with a time delay of about a month for algae and four months for zooplankton. The plankton composition was consistent with the oligo-mesotrophic status of Bull Shoals Lake, but high densities of cyanobacteria at some tributary sites and in upstream reservoirs indicate localized enrichment and the threat of eutrophication in this clear Ozark take.																			1040-2381	2151-5530				MAR	2004	20	1					14	26		10.1080/07438140409354097	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438140409354097													WOS:000220790600002
J	Raffel, TR; Gatz, AJ				Raffel, TR; Gatz, AJ			The orientation of beavers (Castor canadensis) when cutting trees	OHIO JOURNAL OF SCIENCE												We studied patterns in the orientation of cutting when beavers (Castor canadensis) cut trees around Alum Creek Lake in central Ohio. For 462 trees, we measured the slope at the base of the tree, the orientation of the cut relative to this slope, the distance of the tree from the water, the radius of the tree, and the symmetry of the cut. The land around Alum Creek Lake generally slopes toward the water, so to direct the fall of a tree towards the water a beaver should cut a symmetrical tree from the downhill side. Cutting from the downhill side occurred for trees greater than or equal to9.0 m from the water. Near the shore, trees tended to lean toward the water and would fall toward the water regardless of the side from which the beaver cut. At distances <9.0 m from shore, beavers cut predominantly from the uphill side where it should be easy to sit and there is little danger of the tree falling on them. At all distances, beavers showed random orientation when cutting trees on shallow slopes (<20degrees), whereas on steep slopes (especially slopes greater than or equal to30degrees) they cut predominantly from the uphill side. Beavers cut small trees (<5.0 cm diameter) mostly from the downhill side, but tended to cut trees greater than or equal to5.0 cm. in diameter from the uphill side. Overall, enough factors interacted that no single pattern of cutting existed for all trees.

We surveyed modern water chemistry (major ions, conductivity, salinity, lake volume) and sediments (algal pigments, stable isotopes) in 21 lakes that surround Humboldt Lake, Saskatchewan, site of a 2,000-yr climate reconstruction, to quantify spatial synchrony (S, the mean among-lake correlation coefficient) of prairie lake response to climate variability, land use, and their interactions. Whole-lake mass balances of total dissolved substances constructed at each site revealed that evaporation of water controlled seasonal changes in salt content only in years with dry summers (2003), leading to widespread spatial coherence of ecosystems (S = 0.78). In contrast, variations in hydrologic inputs (precipitation, groundwater) and solute fluxes regulated salt balances of lakes during years with wet summers (2004, 2005) and substantially reduced lake synchrony (S = 0.13-0.58). Furthermore, >25% of sites exhibited increased nitrogen influx (as delta N-15) and cyanobacterial production (as fossil pigments) between ca. 1920 and 2003, with particularly strong effects of land use recorded for northeastern sites, where evaporative forcing was greatest. Finally, principal component and canonical ordinations with redundancy analysis both explained similar to 50% of the variance in lake sensitivity to climate and land use and revealed that the effects of climate and land use interacted strongly, but that the unique effects of each factor remained identifiable in modern lake surveys.

This study aimed to improve the performance of the 1-D freshwater lake (FLake) model using satellite-derived K-d for Lake Erie. The CoastColour algorithm was applied to MERIS satellite imagery to estimate K-d. The constant (0.2m 1) and satellite-derived K-d values as well as radiation fluxes and meteorological station observations were then used to run FLake for a meteorological station on Lake Erie. Results improved compared to using the constant K-d value (0.2m(-1)). No significant improvement was found in FLake-simulated lake surface water temperature (LSWT) when K-d variations in time were considered using a monthly average. Therefore, results suggest that a time-independent, lake-specific, and constant satellite-derived K-d value can reproduce LSWT with sufficient accuracy for the Lake Erie station. A sensitivity analysis was also performed to assess the impact of various K-d values on the simulation outputs. Results show that FLake is sensitive to variations in K-d to estimate the thermal structure of Lake Erie. Dark waters result in warmer spring and colder fall temperatures compared to clear waters. Dark waters always produce colder mean water column temperature (MWCT) and lake bottom water temperature (LBWT), shallower mixed layer depth (MLD), longer ice cover duration, and thicker ice. The sensitivity of FLake to K-d variations was more pronounced in the simulation of MWCT, LBWT, and MLD. The model was particularly sensitive to K-d values below 0.5 m(-1). This is the first study to assess the value of integrating K-d from the satellite-based CoastColour algorithm into the FLake model. Satellite-derived K-d is found to be a useful input parameter for simulations with FLake and possibly other lake models, and it has potential for applicability to other lakes where K-d is not commonly measured.

Modeling determinants of nitrogen levels in Danish watercourses, lakes, coastal and marine waters, 1989-2004	NINTH IASTED INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CONTROL AND APPLICATIONS					9th IASTED International Conference on Control and Applications	MAY 30-JUN 01, 2007	Montreal, CANADA	Int Assoc Sci & Technol Dev, QUANSER				This study provides an analysis of the determinants of nitrogen levels in Danish surface waters, and examines the impact of Danish agricultural management policies on these nitrogen levels. The study has four main findings. First, the Danish Government has used a variety of measures to reduce nitrogen balance in agriculture, including reduced use of natural and man made fertilizers to meet the targeted reduction in agriculture nitrogen loadings of 127,000 tonnes N per year. Second, nitrogen balances have fallen from 142 kg/ha in 1989-1992, to 122 kg/ha in 1993-1996, to 105 kg/ha in 1997-2000 and to 92 kg/ha in 2001-2004. Third, nitrogen concentration levels in watercourses have fallen from 8.78 mg/l in 1989-1992, to 7.15 mg/l in 1993-1996, to 6.70 mg/l in 1997-2000 and to 5.70 mg/l in 2001-2004 and in lakes have fallen from 1.88 mg/l in 1989-1992, to 1.87 mg/l in 1993-1996, to 1.45 mg/l in 1997-2000 and to 1.50 mg/l in 2001-2004. Fourth, agriculture net nitrogen balances in watercourses, lakes, coastal waters and fjords and marine waters are significantly driven by nitrogen loadings in agricultural soil and by precipitation runoff.																					978-0-88986-665-2				2007							92	97																WOS:000250339600016

Although it is widely distributed throughout the boreal climatic zone, several European countries also recognize it as an endangered species. In Japan, it was once widely distributed throughout Hokkaido but has dis-appeared or reduced in abundance at its known locations. During 2020-2021, we discovered five new locations of this species in Wakkanai-shi and Sarufutsu-mura, Northern Hokkaido. Growing conditions must be suitable for this species in three of the five locations as it is present with several reproductive shoots or is widely distributed in source pond or lake. However, conditions were poor in the other two locations because few shoots were found or plants were observed only in 2020. Environmental condi-tions in the new locations were similar to those reported in Europe and North America. In three of the four locations at Wakkanai-shi, P. praelongus was distributed mainly along the eastern shore facing sand dunes or hills, suggesting that the distribution of this species depends on groundwater springs flowing from sand dunes or hills. Further populations may be discovered in the future by intensively surveying areas near springs since many sand dune lakes and similar environments are present in Hokkaido.(c) 2022 National Science Museum of Korea (NSMK) and Korea National Arboretum (KNA), Publishing Services by Elsevier.

An analysis of variation in pygmeae and illinoensis suggests that during the Wisconsin glacial maximum these 2 species occurred south of the ice in the Cumberland Plateau region in east-central United States, and that they dispersed first northward through the Appalachians, then east and west into their present range. Geoclimatic evidence suggest that minima did not persist in Newfoundland during the glacial maximum. Its ecological similarity to pygmaea suggests that minima also persisted in the Cumberland Plateau area and dispersed in the same fashion as the other 2 species.																			0008-347X	1918-3240					1967	99	7					703	+		10.4039/Ent99703-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.4039/Ent99703-7													WOS:A19679689900007

Examination of fungal palynomorph assemblages coupled with traditional plant-based palynology permits delineation of local, as opposed to regional, climate signals and provides a baseline for study of ancient fungas. Here, the Fungi in a Warmer World project presents paleoecology and paleoclimatology of 351 fungal morphotypes from 3 sites in the United States: the Clarkia Konservat-Lagerst & auml;tte site (Idaho), the Alum Bluff site (Florida), and the Bouie River site (Mississippi). Of these, 83 fungi are identified as extant taxa and 41 are newly reported from the Miocene. Combining new plant-based paleoclimatic reconstructions with funga-based paleoclimate reconstructions, we demonstrate cooling and hydrologic changes from the Miocene climate optimum to the Serravallian. In the southeastern United States, this is comparable to that reconstructed with pollen and paleobotany alone. In the northwestern United States, cooling is greater than indicated by other reconstructions and hydrology shifts seasonally, from no dry season to a dry summer season. Our results demonstrate the utility of fossil fungi as paleoecologic and paleoclimatic proxies and that warmer than modern geological time intervals do not match the "wet gets wetter, dry gets drier" paradigm. Instead, both plants and fungi show an invigorated hydrological cycle across mid-latitude North America.

J	WILLIAMS, JE; STERN, MA; MUNHALL, AV; ANDERSON, GA				WILLIAMS, JE; STERN, MA; MUNHALL, AV; ANDERSON, GA			CONSERVATION STATUS OF THREATENED FISHES IN WARNER BASIN, OREGON	GREAT BASIN NATURALIST												Two federally listed fishes, the Foskett-speckled dace [Rhinichthys osculus] and Warner sucker [Catostomus warnerensis], are endemic to Warner Basin in south central Oregon. The Foskett speckled dace is native only to a single spring in Coleman Valley. A nearby spring was stocked with dace in 1979 and 1980, and now provides a second population. The present numbers of dace probably are at their highest levels since settlement of the region. The Warner sucker historically occurred throughout much of the Warner Valley, but its distribution and abundance have been reduced by construction of reservoirs and irrigation dams and the introduction of predatory game fishes. Lentic habitats have become dominated by introduced fishes, particularly white crappie, black crappie, and brown bullhead. The largest remaining population of Warner suckers occurs in Hart Lake, where successful reproduction was documented but there is no evidence of recruitment to the adult population.																			0017-3614					OCT 31	1990	50	3					243	248																WOS:A1990EM17100003

Despite that individual sections are often discontinuous, the analysis of a large number of individual sections distributed in the entire basin provides a valuable archive for the reconstruction of environmental changes since the late Pleistocene. This study presents 43 new OSL (optical stimulated luminescence) ages and combines them with 39 previously published ages from the Gonghe Basin for the last 16 ka. From around 15 to 14 ka onwards an increase in moisture facilitated the formation of a vegetation cover and the fixation of loess sediments on the northern and southern side of the basin. After enhanced mobility of aeolian sediments during the dry Younger Dryas greater than before precipitation fixated also the sands in the lower parts of the basin. The increase in moisture can be attributed to the strengthening of the Asian summer monsoon. A comparison with the timing of aeolian sediment accumulation in the neighbouring basins probably indicates a time-transgressive strengthening of the monsoon on the north-eastern Tibetan Plateau. Aeolian sands were first permanently stored from around 17 ka at the Qinghai Lake in the north-east of the area and at 10.5 ka at the Donggi Cona in the south-west. The Gonghe Basin is located in an intermediate position. Highest moisture values occurred during the mid-Holocene from around 7.5 until probably 2.5 ka in the Gonghe Basin. In most parts of the basin aeolian activity was low during this time. In the central part of the basin aeolian sand movement occurred sporadically. Since 2.5 ka aeolian activity in most parts of the basin resumed due to the late Holocene weakening of the Asian summer monsoon. However, the parallel accumulation of aeolian sands and silts indicates an increased human influence. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A total of 43 and 32 waterbird species (not including shorebirds) was recorded at Hamilton Harbour and Windermere Basin, respectively. Generally, more species of loons and grebes and aquatic raptors such as osprey and bald eagle were found at Hamilton Harbour than at Windermere Basin. Species such as mallard and Canada goose which key into unnatural food sources at marinas and golf courses, and double-crested cormorants, associated with a growing colony, were present in large numbers at Hamilton Harbour. Large numbers of common mergansers congregated on the harbor in early winter before freeze-up. On average, waterbirds were found in greater numbers at Windermere Basin. The large numbers of scaup and dabbling ducks, such as black duck and mallard, present at Windermere Basin were attracted by the warm water, low disturbance, and abundant available food source. The ice-free conditions at Windermere Basin also attracted regionally rare wintering species such as northern pintail, northern shoveler, ruddy duck, and green-winged teal. Survey results were compared to unpublished survey data from Cootes Paradise and published results of the annual mid-winter waterfowl survey of western Lake Ontario. The importance of Hamilton Harbour and Windermere Basin to migratory waterbirds should be considered regarding future clean-up of Burlington Bay.																			0380-1330						1992	18	3					420	439		10.1016/S0380-1330(92)71309-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(92)71309-4													WOS:A1992JW93600008

The properties of the dominant species of cyanobacteria correspond best to the natural situation. Thermophilic and alkalophilic forms were identified among them. The purple non-sulfur bacteria, being mesophilic, manifested metabolic activity in light and darkness at a temperature up to 50-degrees, which explains their presence in high-temperature mats.																			0026-2617					JAN-FEB	1992	61	1					86	92																WOS:A1992JH01100017
J	JACOBSEN, BA				JACOBSEN, BA			BLOOM FORMATION OF GLOEOTRICHIA-ECHINULATA AND APHANIZOMENON FLOS-AQUAE IN A SHALLOW, EUTROPHIC, DANISH LAKE	HYDROBIOLOGIA					9th Workshop of the International-Association-for-Phytoplankton-Taxonomy-and-Ecology	JUL 10-18, 1993	MONT RIGI, BELGIUM	INT ASSOC PHYTOPLANKTON TAXON & ECOL				Over a period of four years, the seasonal periodicity of dominant phytoplankton species in a shallow eutrophic Danish lake changed markedly. Cyanophytes prevailed during the summer period of all four years. In the first three years, species of Microcystis, Anabaena and Aphanothece dominated, whereas in the fourth year of investigation, these algae were replaced by Gloeotrichia echinulata (J. E. Smith) Richter and Aphanizomenon flos-aquae (L.) Ralfs. The most striking environmental differences in the fourth year as compared with the previous three years, were an increase in tranparency, from about 0.5 meter in 1989-1991 to more than 2 metres preceding the summer maximum in 1992, and a simultaneous occurrence of low oxygen concentrations. A collapse of the fish population was followed by an increased proportion of large Cladocerans in the zooplankton. Improved light conditions at the bottom and grazing pressure from large Cladocerans favoured growth of the large colony forming blue-green algae, Gloeotrichia echinulata and Aphanizomenon flos-aquae. These species germinate from resting spores in the sediment and are able to sustain some growth there before migration to the lake water. The transfer of algal biomass from the bottom sediment to the water phase was accompanied by a marked increase in concentrations of particulate phosphorus and nitrogen in the entire lake.																			0018-8158					SEP 9	1994	289	1-3					193	197																WOS:A1994PK72300018

The species is distinguished from the other 11 members of the genus by the long cephalic papillae, absence of an excretory pore, pointed termini in both sexes, large amphids, body diameter decrease at the vulva, long vagina, and the absence of lateral genital papillae. Strelkovimermis amphidis n. sp. is the fifth member of this genus recorded from Lake Itasca. The presence of and nature of the bursal sleeve is suggested as a useful distinguishing characteristic. The ratios involving spicule axis length, diameter of the body at the genital pore, and the length of the tail are also discussed in distinguishing species of Strelkovimermis. An expanded key to the species of Strelkovimermis is included.																			0022-3395					FEB	2000	86	1					99	102											10701571					WOS:000085260100017
J	Canavan, CM; Caldwell, CA; Bloom, NS				Canavan, CM; Caldwell, CA; Bloom, NS			Discharge of methylmercury-enriched hypolimnetic water from a stratified reservoir	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												A study conducted from July 1995 to June 1996 examining spatial and temporal distribution of mercury (Hg) at the Caballo Reservoir, New Mexico, revealed that the highest levels of methylmercury (MMHg) occurred in both the inlet and the Rio Grande upstream of the reservoir. As a result, a second study was designed to identify possible sources of the elevated levels of MMHg, and to determine if water discharged from the Elephant Butte Reservoir upstream could be a primary source. In July 1996, as anoxia began to develop in the hypolimnion of the Elephant Butte Reservoir, surface water MMHg concentrations were below the MDL of 0.018 ng/l while water discharged into the tailrace was 0.149 ng/l MMHg. By September 1996, when the anoxic hypolimnion spanned 60% of the total reservoir depth, surface water MMHg was still below the MDL, while discharge water had increased to 1.144 ng/l MMHg. Following reservoir turnover in November 1996, surface water increased to 0.264 ng/l MMHg while discharge water decreased to 0.420 ng/l MMHg. By January 1997, MMHg in the tailrace decreased to pre-stratification levels, and both surface water and discharge water reached similar MMHg levels until the onset of summer stratification in July 1997. This trend was repeated the following year when MMHg concentrations in the tailrace increased from 0.190 ng/l in August 1997 to 1.240 ng/l in September 1997. In addition, vertical profile sampling of the reservoir from August 1997 to September 1997 showed a buildup of MMHg in the anoxic hypolimnion which coincided with increasing levels of MMHg discharged into the tailrace. During the course of this study the single largest contribution of MMHg to the river below the reservoir was from water released through the dam during the fall months of the year.

Reconstruction of Environmental Conditions in the Eastern Part of Primorsky Krai (Russian Far East) in the Late Holocene	CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY												This paper examines a 115 cm long profile section of lacustrine-swamp sediments from the Langou I Bay (eastern part of Primorsky Krai; 44 degrees 25 ' 10.16 '' N, 135 degrees 54 ' 26.08 '' E). According to the produced age model, the sediments are 3900 years old. A multiproxy study involving geochemical, chironomid, diatom, and palynological analysis indicates that the climatic and environmental conditions on the seacoast in the eastern part of Primorsky Krai developed in many respects synchronously with known climatic phases of the Late Holocene. The period from ca. 4200 to 2600 cal years BP corresponds to the first and second warm stages of the Jomon period and the late Jomon transgression in Japan. The peak of summer temperatures in the vicinity of the Langou I Bay occurred between 2900 and 2600 cal years BP. The cooling that began after 2600 cal years BP was not as severe in the study area as in Japan (cold Jomon and Kofun stages): the reconstructed temperatures were 1 degrees C lower than now; in Japan, they were 2-3 degrees C below the current level. The Medieval Climate Optimum (Nara-Heian-Kamakura stage in Japan) reconstructed for the eastern part of Primorsky Krai in the period from 1250 to 750 cal years BP featured a humid climate with summer temperatures ca. 1.5 degrees C higher than at present. The period between 750 and 250 cal years BP correlates with the Little Ice Age: summer temperatures had dropped to 1.5-2 degrees C below the modern one. In the last 200 years, the lake has been shallowing and has nearly dried out. This period is marked by temperature fluctuations amid the trend of climate warming.

Here, we collected fossil pollen samples from a 24.0-m-long drill core from Jilantai Salt Lake (Inner Mongolia, China) to reconstruct the regional climate changes since mid-MIS 3. During 47.0-43.0 cal kyr BP, the frequencies of the occurrence of aquatics and Pediastrum indicate relatively humid conditions. At approximately 43.0 cal kyr BP, the climate became dry, as revealed by the increase in Ephedra and the reduced aquatics and Pediastrum concentrations. The climate during 43.0-27.1 cal kyr BP was drier than that in the previous interval. Aquatics, ferns, and algae were barely detectable, indicating harsh climate conditions during 27.1-12.2 cal kyr BP. During the Holocene, aquatics and algae vanished, and the observed pollen assemblages were dominated by herb taxa; however, a substantial loss of taxa numbers occurred, suggesting that the climate was hyperarid. In general, the climate was relatively humid during the mid-late MIS 3, arid during MIS 2 (27.0-11.7 cal kyr BP), and hyperarid during the Holocene. The evaporation capacity connected with the Northern Hemisphere summer insolation and the Northern Hemisphere ice volume may have played a vital role in vegetation and climate changes in the Jilantai Basin since mid-MIS 3.																			1367-9120	1878-5786				AUG 1	2022	233								105250	10.1016/j.jseaes.2022.105250	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jseaes.2022.105250		MAY 2022											WOS:000802118100002
J	Anderson, JT; Smith, LM				Anderson, JT; Smith, LM			Carrying capacity and diel use of managed playa wetlands by nonbreeding waterbirds	WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN												Playa wetlands on the Southern High Plains of Texas and New Mexico provide essential wintering habitat for migratory waterbirds. Moist-soil management practices have been implemented in playas, yet no variations on the timing of management have been attempted. In addition, previous evaluation of wetland management has considered only diurnal use by waterfowl and has not considered invertebrates. We compared waterbird diversity, waterfowl abundance, and waterfowl carrying capacity based on seeds and invertebrates among playas varying in flooding date (September vs. November) and management regimes (moist-soil managed vs. unmanaged) during nocturnal and diurnal periods during the winters of 1994-1995 and 1995-1996. Waterbird species richness and diversity were greater in November flooded, moist-soil managed than in September flooded, managed; September flooded, unmanaged; and November flooded, unmanaged playas. Waterfowl were more abundant in November flooded, moist-soil managed playas than in the other treatments, and counts were 10.5 times higher during nocturnal than diurnal counts. Evaluation of moist-soil management using diurnal counts only showed no waterfowl-use benefit. Carrying capacity, based on seed biomass, was greater in managed than in unmanaged playas. Potential use days, using invertebrate abundance, was higher in playas flooded in September than in November. Moist-soil management of playas is effective in increasing waterbird diversity and waterfowl abundance. If the main purpose is to evaluate effectiveness of wetland management for waterfowl, then monitoring of nocturnal and diurnal use is essential.																			2328-5540					SUM	1999	27	2					281	291																WOS:000082792300006

MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES OF THE KULDUR THERMAL SPRINGS AND THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE ACCUMULATION OF MICROELEMENTS AND MINERAL FORMATION	BULLETIN OF THE TOMSK POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY-GEO ASSETS ENGINEERING												Relevance. Despite long-term regime observations of the temperature and chemical composition of thermal waters, there is practicaly no information about the microorganisms inhabiting thermal waters and bacterial mats and their biogeochemical role. Purpose: to study the composition, the number of functional groups of bacteria in water and in microbial mats formed in different temper a-ture zones and to investigate their role in the accumulation of trace elements and the formation of minerals in the Kuldur thermal springs.The objects of study were the thermal underground waters of the Kuldur deposit of the following wels no. 1-87, 2-87, 3-87, 3-51, 5-51, as welas microbial mats formed in lakes and streams along the outflow of the Kuldur thermal springs.Methods: chemical and microbiological methods. To analyze the contents of microelements in water, the samples were analyzed using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. Determination of the content of chlorophyla in microbial mats was carried out spectropho-tometricaly in ethanol extracts. The number of different physiological groups of bacteria was determined on various selective media by the Koch method and limiting dilutions. Cultures were cleaned by the exhaustive stroke method. Elemental analysis of microbial mats was per-formed by the ISP-MS method on a spectrometer. The phase composition of minerals was determined using X-ray phase analysis on a dif-fractometer.Results. It is shown that the thermal waters of the studied wells are alkaline, low mineralized, sodium predominates in the composition of cations, chlorine, fluorine and sulfate ions prevail among anions. Lithium, arsenic, and strontium dominate among microelements. In the studied wells of thermal waters, a low number of bacteria of various physiological groups was noted, while their number was higher in low-er temperature waters. In microbial mats of different thermal zones, a different composition of physiological groups of bacteria was noted. Microorganisms of the geochemical cycle of sulfur, iron and manganese prevailed. The presence of cyanobacteria, which are character-ized by the presence of chlorophyla, was shown in the composition of alselected mats. A significant accumulation of many rare earth elements (especialy light) - vanadium, as well as uranium and thorium by microbial communities - was revealed. In microbial mats, silicon was predominantly deposited in the form of quartz and plagioclase.

JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												In a recent paper, Nof et al. (J Paleolimnol 35:417-439, 2006) suggest a physical mechanism which could account for the formation of ice on Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee) in northern Israel. Based on the sea surface temperature record of sediment cores from the Mediterranean Sea the authors argue that centennial-scale cold events had the potential to trigger local 'springs ice' formation on the lake in the past. Here, we demonstrate that a closer inspection of the paleoceanographic record in combination with correlation and regression analyses of meteorological data provides no evidence for such cold events in the lake region during the last 10,000 years. Thus, the formation of 'springs ice' on Lake Kinneret was unlikely at least since the beginning of the Neolithic.					; Lamy, Frank/H-3611-2014; Arz, Helge/A-6659-2013	Arz, Helge Wolfgang/0000-0002-1997-1718; Prange, Matthias/0000-0001-5874-756X; Lamy, Frank/0000-0001-5952-1765; 													0921-2728					NOV	2007	38	4					589	593		10.1007/s10933-007-9136-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-007-9136-8													WOS:000250238600009

Eleven of these 13 birds were successfully satellite tracked, and five of these I I provided complete migratory information from their breeding grounds in Yakutia, Siberia, to their wintering area at Poyang Lake, in China. Several stopover sites were identified, the most important being in Qiqihar-Baicheng (China), Shuangtaizi River delta (China), and Yellow River delta (China). Birds rested more frequently in Russia than in China, suggesting availability of suitable wetland habitat in Russia and absence of adequate, suitable wetland habitat in China. Wintering habitat in China also faces numerous threats. Habitats utilized by Siberian cranes are also important to other threatened wetland birds that have been satellite-tracked recently. If Siberian crane habitat needs fail to be addressed, this critically endangered species will be further endangered. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Regional recharge could only be of minor importance since the amount of local precipitation is about the same as that of evaporation from the surface and there is no major outflow. From the existing isotope data no evidence was found of an inflow of fresh karstic water in the deepest part of the lake. Mean residence times of 30-40 years were obtained for water in the lake if the enrichment of tritium due to evaporation is taken into consideration. At the same time, the homogeneity of the isotope results indicates good mixing of this deep karstic reservoir. Seven springs were sampled in the Rijeka region and residence times between 5 and 10 years were calculated for the water contained in them.																			0951-4198						1997	11	6					651	655																WOS:A1997WV61600021

We amended 1-mu m filtrates with a single nutrient or nutrient combinations at 5 or 10 mu M final concentration, and the limiting nutrient or nutrient combination was inferred from the assay in which bacterial growth was most stimulated. The following nutrients were added individually or in combination: glucose, amino acids, peptone, and ammonium as C and N sources, and inorganic phosphate. From January until the beginning of the phytoplankton spring bloom in mid-April, C alone was growth-limiting. During the spring bloom a complex growth-limitation pattern occurred; first P was limiting, then for only 1 week C + N together, and thereafter P + C. During the clear-water phase with very low chlorophyll concentrations, P + C together limited bacterial growth again, interrupted by a period when C + N + P shortage caused a triple limitation. Later in the season, P + C were growth-limiting again. The growth efficiency (bacterial biomass produced/substrates used) on the basis of amino acid and carbohydrate used varied between 17 and 35%. The addition of various C and N sources indicated that the growth efficiency strongly depended on the quality of the substrates and the adaptation of the bacterial assemblages, for example, whether C and N originated from amino acids or glucose and ammonium.																			0095-3628					JUL-AUG	1995	30	1					89	104											24185415					WOS:A1995RF81800008

The conditions upstream, especially in the outlets of lakes, did not affect the zooplankton communities downstream. This was also true of tributaries which had no influence on the shape of the zooplankton communities in the main river. The number of zooplankton in the outlets of eutrophic lakes was greater than in those of mesotrophic lakes. Increased vegetation cover significantly affected mainly the crustacean communities of zooplankton. Larger amounts of zooplankton were observed in rivers where the riparian zone was not covered with vegetation, but this difference was not significant. The hydrological conditions of the rivers and the Secchi depth visibility strongly impacted the composition of the zooplankton. The influence of abiotic factors was most pronounced on the abundance of cladocerans, and least pronounced on the abundance of rotifers.					; Pilecka-Rapacz, Malgorzata/K-8138-2012	czerniawski, robert/0000-0001-7785-087X; Pilecka-Rapacz, Malgorzata/0000-0002-1423-8808; 													1895-104X	1644-3632				AUG	2011	6	4					659	674		10.2478/s11535-011-0024-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11535-011-0024-x													WOS:000290803200020

Despite this potentially harmful effect, very few studies have been undertaken in subsurface aquifers. This paper presents the first results of a study of natural colloids and particles in a karstic aquifer. The site was chosen for its coverage by clay layers and peat which deliver various and numerous particle types in water. The methodological part describes three methods used for size determination and sample fractionation of surface water and spring water. These methods have been adapted for the treatment of multiple samples due to the rapid discharge variation typical of karstic aquifers. The analysis of many particle size distributions (PSD) shows that they can be described by a Pareto law. The variation of the slope of the PSD at the spring is mainly dependent on discharge. This behavior is interpreted as a washing of the karstic drains during the first phase of high flow events. Fractionation of the samples allowed application of various characterization techniques to particle size classes. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns showed that most of the mineral particles originated from Quaternary deposits and limestones. However the use of scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive spectrometer (SEM-EDS) detailed the composition of individual particles and revealed particles not found by XRD. These techniques also showed the high complexity of the natural particles and the important place of coprecipitation in their formation. Consequences on the fluxes of particulate matter and its potential role as a carrier of contaminants are discussed.																			0943-0105					JUN	1998	34	4					257	269		10.1007/s002540050277	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s002540050277													WOS:000074735200001

Spatial variability in the European winter precipitation δ18O-NAO relationship:: Implications for reconstructing NAO-mode climate variability in the Holocene	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												This paper investigates the links between precipitation delta O-18 and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) on decadal timescales to identify the optimum locations within Europe at which to compile delta O-18-based proxy records of past NAO variability. delta O-18 is a commonly used paleoclimate (rainfall and temperature) proxy preserved in natural archives including stalagmites, ice cores, tree rings, and lake sediments. Precipitation delta O-18 data (delta O-18(p)), compiled from Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation (GNIP) stations in the North Atlantic sector reveal the direction and strength of the delta O-18(p)-NAO relationship in mid-latitude, high-latitude, and Mediterranean Europe. The highly significant, positive delta O-18(p)-NAO relationship in central Europe is attributed to the strong control of air temperature on delta O-18(p) in this region. The delta O-18(p)-NAO relationship is strongly negative at high-latitude GNIP sites and weak at Mediterranean sites. Decadal-scale solar irradiance variations correlate with winter delta O-18(p) at eight midlatitude sites.					; McDermott, Frank/F-3096-2010	Foley, Aideen/0000-0002-3310-9622; McDermott, Frank/0000-0001-7037-7936; Baldini, Lisa/0000-0002-9579-1444													0094-8276	1944-8007				FEB 29	2008	35	4							L04709	10.1029/2007GL032027	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2007GL032027													WOS:000253715400001

Analyzing the Relationship Between Tree Canopy Coverage and Snowpack in the Great Salt Lake Watershed	SUSTAINABILITY												Utah, USA, relies heavily on snowpack for water to sustain its growing population. Scientists and policy makers are exploring and proposing several potential sustainable solutions to improving flow to the Great Salk Lake as it recently has significantly declined in size, including removing tree canopy. This study examines the influence of tree canopy coverage, climate, and topography on snow water equivalent (SWE) within the Great Salt Lake Watershed. Using SNOTEL data, NLCD land use/land cover rasters, t-tests, and multiple linear regression (MLR), the study analyzed SWE variability in relation to canopy density, winter precipitation, elevation, temperature, and latitude. Initial t-tests showed significant differences in SWE between sites with canopy coverage below and above 70%, yet tree canopy was excluded as a significant predictor in the MLR model. Instead, SWE was primarily explained by mean winter precipitation, elevation, average winter high temperatures, and latitude. Additionally, canopy change analysis of the 2018 Pole Creek Fire in the Jordan River watershed showed no significant changes in SWE following canopy loss. This study highlights the dominant role of climatic factors in influencing snowpack dynamics on a watershed scale. It also provides important data for sustainable watershed and forestry management and a framework for understanding snowpack responses to climate and land cover changes in saline lake ecosystems.

Environmental changes at both lakes were interpreted based on magnetic susceptibility, organic-matter flux, C/N, delta C-13(org), Ti concentrations, and mass accumulation rates. Chronologies were established using 16 AMS radiocarbon dates, and average deposition rates in both environments are higher than 0.2 mm/year throughout the Holocene. At Vikjordvatnet, sedimentary geochemical properties define three distinct phases of sedimentation related to changes in aquatic productivity and gradual landscape development. Following deglaciation, during the early Holocene (11.6-7.2 ka), aquatic productivity increased and the landscape stabilized as regional temperatures increased in response to higher summer insolation and increasing inflow of warm Atlantic water into the Norwegian Sea. Centennial-scale intervals of decreased organic-matter flux, from 10.9 to 10.2 ka and 9.2 to 8.0 ka, record episodes of instability during the early Holocene. These may represent regional cooling events related to freshwater forcing and a slowdown of the northward transport of warm water into the North Atlantic. During the mid-Holocene (7.2-4.8 ka) organic-matter properties show less variability and the timing of this phase corresponds with the regional Holocene thermal maximum. The late Holocene sediments (4.8 ka-present) record a transition to colder climate conditions. The record from Fiskebolvatnet captures periodic changes in clastic input related to runoff and exhibits high-frequency variations over the last 9.5 ka. The most significant change in sedimentation was during the late Holocene (4.3 ka-present) when the frequency and magnitude of runoff events show an abrupt transition to wetter conditions. The timing of this shift corresponds to other regional reconstructions that indicate wetter and colder conditions during the late Holocene.					; Bradley, Raymond/P-9358-2015	Balascio, Nicholas/0000-0001-7106-3541; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				JUN	2012	48	1			SI		259	273		10.1007/s10933-012-9604-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-012-9604-7													WOS:000304566900018

J	Radoane, M; Ciaglic, V; Radoane, N				Radoane, Maria; Ciaglic, Valerian; Radoane, Nicolae			Hydropower impact on the ice jam formation on the upper Bistrita River, Romania	COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												In this work, we investigate the causes of ice jams along the Bistrita River, which has the longest mountainous course (216 km) of any river in Romania. Over a length of 25-30 km on the upstream portion of the Izvoru Muntelui Reservoir, ice block accumulations known as ice jams form almost yearly during the cold season. Analysis of the hydroclimatic and morphological conditions of the riverbed has revealed that a certain combination of their temporal variations is favourable to ice jam formation. The hydraulic geometry of the Bistrita river bed is favourable to the flow of frazil slush, frazil pans, and ice floes while the air temperature is below -7 degrees C and the water level of the Izvoru Muntelui Reservoir is below 500 m. Above this level, ice jams block the river bed. and this blockage advances upstream at velocities of several hundred meters per day. The most dramatic instances of this phenomenon were recorded during the winter of 2002-2003, when the thickness of the ice was on the order of 6 m and the resulting floods caused damages and claimed human lives. The appearance in 2003 of the Topoliceni Reservoir, 4 km upstream of the Izvoru Muntelui Reservoir, has complicated the evolution of these winter phenomena, with the lake itself acting as an accumulation pool for ice from upstream. This development has led to damages and inconveniences in canals and at the entrances to power plants, spillways, outlet works, and other hydraulic structures. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

J	BOWMAKER, AP				BOWMAKER, AP			PHYSICOCHEMICAL LIMNOLOGY OF MWENDA RIVER MOUTH, LAKE KARIBA	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Changes which occurred in the area of mixing where a seasonally flowing tributary river enters Lake Kariba [Rhodesia] are described. This area was partly covered by a floating vegetation mat, primarily Salvinia molesta D.S. Mitchell. Beneath this mat O2 availability seems to have been limiting during summer, but only during periods of minimal river discharge and deep within the mat. Nearer the edge of the mat conditions were alleviated by wind-induced intrusions of lake water. The river entered the lake as under, inter, and overflows, dependent on volume of discharge. A local, shallow, periodically tilted thermocline persisted throughout the year, overlying the overall lake thermocline which occurred in summer. Oxyclines only developed in association with the latter. NO3 N concentrations were approximately 10 times greater than found elsewhere in Lake Kariba. This is attributed to 2 factors. The 1st is the possibility of the river deriving run-off NO3 from geological deposits of the Molteno series in its catchment. The 2nd, that NO3 was also derived from the high riverine concentrations of albuminoid N being deposited on the lake bottom, mineralizing to NH3 during the dry season, and being oxidized to NO3 by the scouring action and high O2 content of flood underflow in subsequent years.																			0003-9136						1976	77	1					66	108																WOS:A1976BG19000005

Coping with the cold: energy storage strategies for surviving winter in freshwater fish	ECOGRAPHY												For many ectothermic animals, the acquisition, storage and depletion of lipids is integral to successfully coping with reduced metabolic rates and activity levels associated with cold, winter periods. In fish, lipids are crucial for overwinter survival and successful reproduction. The timing and magnitude of seasonal lipid storage should therefore vary predictably among fish with different thermal preferences and spawn times. Small- and large-bodied fish should also face different constraints associated with season that influence lipid cycling. However, much work to date has been species- and location-specific and a general conceptual model for the seasonal energy budgets of freshwater fish is lacking. Here, we conducted a comprehensive literature review of seasonal lipid levels in freshwater fishes. We predicted that warm and cool water species would be more likely to demonstrate peak lipid levels during warm months than cold water species, and expected a larger magnitude of annual lipid cycling in warm and cool water compared to cold water fish. We also expected dampened lipid cycling in larger fish due to their lower mass-specific metabolic rates. Observed patterns in the timing and magnitude of lipid storage contradicted our prediction because lipid cycling was widespread across species, despite thermal guild, with peak lipid levels commonly occurring during warmer months, even in cold water fish. For body size effects, larger bodied fish species had dampened seasonal lipid cycling, as predicted. We developed a conceptual framework describing how the 'scope' for variation in annual lipid cycling changes with body size both among and within species in order to guide future work. Together, our findings suggest that energy acquired during warm months is broadly important for overwinter survival and reproduction in fishes, and provide a new perspective on the differential constraints and physiological responses to seasonality among freshwater fish. Improving our understanding of these dynamics is especially pressing given that a changing global climate is anticipated to alter existing seasonal signals.

Pond smelt, which is important fish species from commercial and cultural perspectives, influences the zooplankton community in the lake. Following the massive fish kill, Daphnia galeata appeared and their population density increased to previously unseen levels by summer 2017. To help recover the fish population, larval pond smelt were released into the lake. Consequently, D. galeata has rarely appeared in Lake Suwa since summer 2017, except for a low-density population observed in May-June 2018. These phenomena indicated that fish predation is a possible primary factor for suppressing daphnid populations in shallow eutrophic lake. Zooplankton populations showed species-specific responses to the alterations in predation pressure. When the D. galeata population peaked after the fish kill event, rotifers, which are small-sized competitors of daphnids, and calanoids tended to decrease in density. Rotifers then increased with the decrease in the daphnid populations due to the recovery of fish. Alternatively, cyclopoids, which demonstrated a similar population density following the fish kill event, tended to decrease when the fish population recovered. The population densities of Leptodora cf. kindtii/richardi and Bosmina spp. did not significantly differ between before the massive kill event and after pond smelt recovery. It is believed that the changes in zooplankton population densities observed in the present study may provide insights for further monitoring of aquatic food webs in eutrophic water systems, including Lake Suwa, where re-oligotrophication is occurring and biological interactions are changing.

Chronology and magnetic proxies for lake level	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												This study presents the age control and environmental magnetism components of a new, late Pleistocene paleoclimate record for the Great Basin of western North America. Two new cores from the Summer Lake sub-basin of pluvial Lake Chewaucan, Oregon, USA are correlated to basin margin outcrops on the basis of tephrochronology, lithostratigraphy, sediment magnetism and paleomagnetic secular variation. Eleven tephra layers were found in the cores that correlate to tephra identified previously in the outcrop. The Olema ash was also found in one of the cores; its stratigraphic position, relative to 3 dated tephra layers, indicates that its age is 50-55 ka, somewhat younger than has been previously reported. The Summer Lake sediments are divided into deep and shallow lake lithosomes based on sedimentary features. The stratigraphic position of these lithosomes support the tephra-based correlations between the outcrop and the cores. These sediments contain a well resolved record of the Mono Lake Excursion (MLE) and an earlier paleomagnetic excursion as well as a high quality replication of the paleosecular variation immediately above the MLE. Relative sedimentation rates increased dramatically toward the depocenter during intervals of low-lake level. In contrast, during intervals of high-lake level, relative sedimentation rates were comparable along the basin axis from the basin margin to the depocenter. The magnetic mineralogy of the Summer Lake sediments is dominated by pseudo-single domain (titano)magnetite and intervals of high/low magnetite concentration coincide with lithosomes that indicate high/low lake levels. Magnetic grain size also varies in accord with bulk sediment grain size as indicated by the silt/clay ratio. To a first order, variations in magnetic parameters, especially those attributable to the concentration of magnetic minerals, correlate well with global glacial/interglacial oscillations as indicated by marine oxygen isotope stages. This relationship can be explained by increased dissolution of (titano)magnetite minerals as lake level dropped and the lake became more productive biologically. This inference is supported by a correspondence between lower concentrations of magnetite with higher levels of total organic carbon and vice-versa.

Predicting Total Nitrogen, Total Phosphorus, Total Organic Carbon, Dissolved Oxygen and Iron in Deep Waters of Swedish Lakes	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELING & ASSESSMENT												In many lakes, the physical and chemical characteristics are monitored for surface waters but not for deep waters. Yet, deep waters may be important for understanding the dynamics of lake water chemistry variables over the year. In this study, multiple regression models have been created for five different variables, total phosphorus, total nitrogen, total organic carbon, dissolved oxygen (DO) and iron, in the deep water for 61 Swedish temperate or subarctic lakes. The investigated season was February to October, depending on the data availability. Regressions used the corresponding variables from the surface water as well as different morphometric parameters as independent variables. It was possible to construct meaningful models (r (2) > 0.65; p < 0.05) for most of the variables and months. However, it was not possible to attain this criterion for some months regarding the DO concentration. Surface water concentrations were in general most important for predicting corresponding deep water concentrations. An exception was that during summer, DO differed considerably between surface waters and deep waters and voluminous lakes had particularly high DO concentrations in deep waters. No cross-systems relationship could be found between deepwater hypoxia and total phosphorus in deep waters during summer when phosphorus diffusion from sediments is most likely. A mass-balance modelling example was applied to illustrate the use of the produced models. These findings may provide a better understanding of the dynamics of these five variables in temperate or subarctic lakes.																			1420-2026	1573-2967				OCT	2015	20	5					411	423		10.1007/s10666-015-9456-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10666-015-9456-4													WOS:000360554900001

The connection of biogenic lamina thickness with growing-season or open-water season climate has been the focus of a limited number of studies. We examined biogenic laminae deposited during the past 100 years in five Finnish lakes representing different catchment types. We compared variations in biogenic lamina thicknesses with growing-season temperature records and open-water-season precipitation records. Statistical analyses for the whole study period reveal that the studied lakes generally respond positively to variations in growing-season temperature and open-water season precipitation. This suggests that warm summers intensify primary production while precipitation enhances transportation of allochthonous biogenic material and nutrients into the lake. Both mechanisms lead to enhanced biogenic lamina thickness. Two lakes reveal a more complex relationship to climate. Biogenic lamina thicknesses record a distinguishable climate signal despite human activities in the catchments, such as peatland drainage and forest cutting. We conclude that variations in biogenic lamina thickness of such boreal (clastic)-biogenic varves show potential for growing-season climate reconstructions. However, the response of each lake to climate parameters should be tested and understood separately.

Groundwater flow and storage within an alpine meadow-talus complex	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												The different types of geological deposits and rock formations found in alpine watersheds play key roles in regulating the rate and timing of runoff to mountain rivers. Talus and alpine meadows are dominant features in these areas, but scant data exist for their capacity to store and transmit groundwater. To gain further understanding of these processes, we have undertaken a combined geophysical and hydrological study of a small (2100 m(2)) alpine meadow and surrounding talus within the Lake O'Hara watershed in the Canadian Rockies. Several intersecting ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) profiles and a seismic refraction profile were acquired to map the thickness of the talus and to image the topography of the bedrock basin that underlies the meadow. From analysis of the GPR and seismic profiles, we estimate that the talus deposits are relatively thin (< 6 m). Combined interpretations from the GPR and ERT data show that the fine-grained sediment comprising the meadow basin has a total volume of ca. 3300 m(3) and has a maximum thickness of ca. 4 m. Annual snow surveys and stream gauging reveal that the total input volume of snowmelt and rainfall to the meadow basin is several times larger than its groundwater storage capacity, giving rise to low total-dissolved species concentrations (14-21 mg/L) within the meadow groundwater. Observations from four piezometers established on the meadow show that the water table fluctuates rapidly in response to spring snowmelt and precipitation events but otherwise maintains a relatively stable depth of 0.3-0.4 m below the meadow surface during summer months. A slug test performed on one of the piezometers indicated that the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the shallow meadow sediments is 2.5x10(-7) m/s. We suggest that a bedrock saddle imaged underneath the southern end of the meadow forms a natural constriction to subsurface flow out of the basin and helps to maintain the stable water-table depth.

Stable source of Holocene spring precipitation recorded in leaf wax hydrogen-isotope ratios from two New York lakes	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Changes in synoptic atmospheric circulation patterns are thought to play a role in establishing millennial scale climate periods during the end of the late glacial and the Holocene. In the northeastern United States, multi-proxy evidence documents fluctuations in effective moisture and temperatures for this time period, but constraining the relationship between atmospheric processes and these climate regimes is not straightforward. Because the hydrogen-isotope ratios of sedimentary terrestrial leaf waxes can reflect precipitation delta D, these long-chain hydrocarbon compounds are an excellent tool to investigate moisture sourcing. Here we present lake sediment and leaf wax carbon- and hydrogen-isotope records that span the past similar to 14.0 thousand years from Heart Lake and Moose Pond in the Adirondack Mountains (ADK), New York. High initial lake productivity after basin inception is reflected in low C:N ratios (<15), and higher relative short chain n-alkane (n-C-17, n-C-19, and n-C-21) to long chain n-alkane (n-C-27, n-C(29)and n-C-31) concentration ratios. The Holocene record is characterized by low bulk and n-alkane delta C-13 (similar to -28 parts per thousand, similar to -31 parts per thousand, respectively), high ACL(25-35), (-28), and high relative concentrations of long chain n-alkane homologues, indicating a dominantly terrestrial source of organic matter for this time period. Hydrogenisotope ratios of n-C-29 n-alkane from both lake basins range only similar to 20 parts per thousand through the Holocene and reconstructed precipitation delta D (delta D-precip) from both basins is in good agreement with that of modern modeled spring precipitation. This suggests there may have been no major changes in the sourcing of spring precipitation for the ADK throughout the time of record. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Pollen analysis of sediment samples from a 100-cm-deep sedimentary core from Loktak Lake, the biggest freshwater lake in Manipur state, north-east India, has provided insight into the changing vegetation and climate of the region during the Late Holocene. The palyno-investigation has revealed that between 2330 and 1460cal yr BP (LL-I zone), an open vegetation consisting mostly of grasses and heathland taxa, namely Xanthium, Artemisia, Asteraceae and Amaranthaceae, with scattered tree elements, viz. Fabaceae, Terminalia, Schleichera, Syzygium, Elaeocarpus, Meliaceae and Sapotaceae, existed near the lake under a warm and relatively dry climate. Between 1460 and 560cal yr BP (LL-II zone), the consolidation of core forest constituents was noticed, with relative enhancement of major arboreal taxa along with marshy and aquatic taxa such as Cyperaceae, Polygonum and Lemna during 1460 to 1150cal yr BP (LL-IIa subzone), indicating a humid climate attributable to a strong south-west monsoon. Evidence of agricultural practices showed the presence of cereal and other cultural pollen taxa. Later, a more humid climate persisted during the period 1150 to 560cal yr BP (LL-IIb subzone) as indicated by an exceptional increase in a major arboreal group (Syzygium-Schleichera-Lagerstroemia-Dipterocarpaceae-Moraceae), suggesting the consolidation of vegetation around the lake under warm and increasingly humid climate conditions, and this occurs during the Medieval Warm Period (MWP). From 560cal yr BP to the present (LL-III zone), a rise in cereal and heathland taxa indicates a relatively less humid climate; reduction in south-west monsoon precipitation is invoked to explain this which is supported by a steep fall in woodland, consistent with an anthropogenic influence.

The main, plinian phase of the eruption lasted about 4 hours from 12.35 and produced pumice-flow deposits (unit PF) overlain by a pumice fallout layer distributed mainly to the southwest (unit P), and intra-plinian scoria-flow deposits (unit SF), Uppermost scoria-rich ash fall layers (unit A3) likely relate to late, discrete eruptive pulses, A few small explosions resumed on February 11 and 12 leaving no recognizable deposit. An embryonic lava dome had formed in the crater bottom by April, then was submerged by the new crater lake. Destruction of the summit area resulted from emplacement of the pre-plinian pumice surge up to 4-5 km on the south and west flanks, and of the early plinian pumice flows up to 1-2 km radially from the crater, before these were channelized in the main valleys to further travel 3 km. Most of the 32 human deaths resulted from roof collapse under the load of fallout tephra beyond the devastated area, which had been evacuated before the eruption began. The eruption produced 0.13 km(3) of tephra, of which 0.12 km(3) represent the products of the plinian phase. The average eruptive rate of the plinian phase is estimated to have been similar to 7.5 X 10(6) kg/s magma DRE. The pumice flows are interpreted to have been formed due to unsteadiness and low velocity of the eruptive column at the beginning of the plinian phase. The intra-plinian scoria flows incorporate either more degassed or colder juvenile magma; they were presumably erupted at the edge of the column, due to fluctuations in the mass flux and in pressure in the conduit.

The multi-proxy evidence of simultaneously changing diatom, Cladocera, and chrysophyte assemblages along with the increased rates of organic matter accumulation and pigment concentrations suggest that the lake has undergone a distinct typological change starting from the turn of the 20th century. This change, indicating an increase in lake productivity, parallels a pronounced rise in the meteorologically reconstructed mean annual and summer temperatures in the region between ca. 1850 and 1930 s. We postulate that, during the Little Ice Age, the lake was not, or was only weakly, thermally stratified during summer, whereas the subsequent increase in air and hence epilimnetic water temperatures resulted in the development of the present summer stratification. The increased thermal stability of the lake created more suitable conditions for the growth of phyto- and zooplankton and changed the overall primary production from benthos to plankton. Mineral magnetic and carbonaceous particle records suggest long-distance pollution, particularly since the 1920 s, yet the observed changes in lake biota and productivity can hardly be explained by this very minor background pollution; the 20th century species configurations are typical of neutral waters and do not indicate any response to pollution.					; Dearing, John/E-4206-2010; Lami, Andrea/M-3982-2019; Lami, Andrea/F-1415-2013; Rose, Neil/C-5739-2008	Rose, Neil/0000-0002-5697-7334; Korhola, Atte A./0000-0003-2577-6502; Appleby, Peter/0000-0002-6945-1841; Lami, Andrea/0000-0003-3627-0363; Dearing, John/0000-0002-1466-9640; Sorvari Sundet, Sanna/0000-0002-0704-6592													0921-2728	1573-0417				JUN	2002	28	1					59	77		10.1023/A:1020371902214	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1020371902214													WOS:000178212200005

Spatiotemporal Spread of Cucurbit Downy Mildew in the Eastern United States	PHYTOPATHOLOGY												The dynamics of cucurbit downy mildew, caused by Pseudoperonospora cubensis, in the eastern United States in 2008 and 2009 were investigated based on disease records collected in 24 states as part of the Cucurbit downy Mildew ipmPIPE monitoring program. The mean season-long rate of temporal disease progress across the 2 years was 1.4 new cases per day. Although cucurbit downy mildew was detected in mid-February and early March in southern Florida, the disease progressed slowly during the spring and early summer and did not enter its exponential phase until mid-June. The median nearest-neighbor distance of spread of new disease cases was approximate to 110 km in both years, with of the distances being > 240 km. Considering disease epidemics on all cucurbits, the epidemic expanded at a rate of 9.2 and 10.5 km per day in 2008 and 2009, respectively. These rates of spatial spread are at the lower range of those reported for the annual spread of tobacco blue mold in the southeastern United States, a disease that is also aerially dispersed over long distances. These results suggest that regional spread of cucurbit downy mildew may be limited by opportunities for establishment in the first half of the year, when fewer cucurbit hosts are available for infection. The O-ring statistic was used to determine the spatial pattern of cucurbit downy mildew outbreaks using complete spatial randomness as the null model for hypothesis testing. Disease outbreaks in both years were spatially aggregated and the extent of spatial dependence was up to 1,000 km. Results from the spatial analysis suggests that disease outbreaks in the Great Lakes and mid-Atlantic regions may be due to the spread of P cubensis sporangia from outbreaks of the disease near the Georgia/South Carolina/North Carolina border rather than from overwintering sites in southern Florida. Space time point pattern analysis indicated strong (P < 0.001) evidence for a space time interaction and a space time risk window of approximate to 3 to 5 months after first disease outbreak and 300 to 600 km was detected in both years. Results of this study support the hypothesis that infection of cucurbits by P cubensis appears to be an outcome of a contagion process, and the relative large space time window suggests that factors occurring on a large spatial scale (approximate to 1,000 km) facilitate the spread of cucurbit downy mildew in the eastern United States.

Sediment traps were placed in several lakes of the "Lago Grande de Curuai"floodplain during different water-level phases: the end of the period of water-level reduction ('falling water') and the start of the period of water-level increase ('rising water'). Vertical seasonal fluxes of settling particles (SP) are very difficult to estimate and interpret, especially during 'falling water' periods, when the concentration of suspended matter in the water column is greater than during 'rising water' periods, probably due to resuspension processes. Vertical fluxes of settling particles (SP) varied between ca. 4 and 2000 gm(-2) day(-1). Fluxes of organic carbon ranged between (5-50 gCm(-2) day(-1)) during the 'falling water' and between (0.041-4 gCm(-2) day(-1)) during the 'rising water'. The core is characterised by two laminated, sedimentological units. Sediments in the upper unit, which generally coarsens upwards, are interpreted as a progradation sequence of the sand and silt flat at the entrance of an inflow channel where the core was collected. This unit is composed of three sub-units: a superficial layer reworked by bioturbation, a lower sub-unit characterised by horizontal and sub-horizontal laminations of fine sands and silts, and a basal sub-unit composed of horizontal laminations of fine silts and clays. The lower unit is characterised by horizontal and sub-horizontal laminations of fine sands and silts and corresponds to the top of an older accumulating sequence. These changes show that the sedimentary environment is very dynamic at the centennial scale. Sedimentation rates generally ranged between 0.42 and 1.34 cm year(-1), and were estimated to range from 0.56 to 1.35 cm year(-1) after normalisation for clay-sized particles (<4 mum). Floodplain sediment accumulation generally varies between 0.42, 1.16, and 1.10 gm(-2) year(-1), within the first, second and third sub-units, respectively. In the second unit the non-supported Pb-210 date is close to the detection limit. Carbon content is relatively low, around 1% sediment weight through the core, although mean carbon accumulation rates are very high, generally 100 gm(-2) year(-1) and peaking at 250 gm(-2) year(-1). These results suggest that Amazon floodplain lakes may constitute an important sink for organic carbon. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Lake margin bioherms form continuous belts for hundreds of metres to kilometres, subparallel to shorelines. Sublacustrine spring mounds are spaced at hundreds of metres to kilometres and aligned along faults. Hydrothermal travertine mounds and aprons with planar clinoforms or terraced slopes are controlled by faults, thermal water discharge and substrate topography. Fluvial tufa barrages, cascades and terraced slopes are controlled by climate, vegetation and substrate gradient. The wide spectrum of carbonate microfabrics ranges from clotted peloidal micrite and laminated boundstone to crystalline dendrite cementstone. Non-marine carbonate microfabrics cannot be linked to specific depositional environments, and are not deterministic proxies for the interpretation of build-up architecture. Microfabric associations can be indicative, but not exclusive, of specific depositional environments and geometry. Stable isotope geochemistry is a useful tool to distinguish between hydrothermal, karstic freshwater and evaporative lake carbonates. Carbonate precipitation results from a continuum of abiotic and biologically influenced/induced processes in settings where carbonate supersaturation is largely driven by physicochemical mechanisms and microbial biofilms, even if acting as passive low-energy surface sites for nucleation, are widely present.

J	Krinner, G; Boike, J				Krinner, Gerhard; Boike, Julia			A study of the large-scale climatic effects of a possible disappearance of high-latitude inland water surfaces during the 21st century	BOREAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												This study evaluates the climatic impact of possible future changes in high-latitude inland water surface (IWS) area. We carried out a set of climate-change experiments with an atmospheric general circulation model in which different scenarios of future changes of IWS extent were prescribed. The simulations are based on the SRES-A1B greenhouse gas emission scenario and represent the transient climatic state at the end of the 21st century. Our results indicate that the impact of a reduction in IWS extent depends on the season considered: the total disappearance of IWS would lead to cooling during cold seasons and to warming in summer. In the annual mean, the cooling effect would be dominant. In an experiment in which the future change of prescribed IWS extent is prescribed as a function of the simulated changes of permafrost extent, we find that these changes are self-consistent in the sense that their effects on the simulated temperature and precipitation patterns would not be contradictory to the underlying scenario of changes in IWS extent. In this "best guess" simulation, the projected changes in IWS extent would reduce future near-surface warn-ling over large parts of northern Eurasia by about 20% during the cold season, while the impact in North America and during summer is less clear. As a whole, the direct climatic impact of future IWS changes is likely to be moderate.

J	Shabbar, A; Bonsal, B; Khandekar, M				Shabbar, A; Bonsal, B; Khandekar, M			Canadian precipitation patterns associated with the southern oscillation	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Precipitation responses over Canada associated with the two extreme phases of the Southern Oscillation (SO), namely El Nino and La Nina, are identified. Using the best available precipitation data from 1911 to 1994, both the spatial and temporal behavior of the responses are analyzed from the El Nino/La Nina onset to several seasons afterward. Composite and correlation analyses indicate that precipitation over a large region of southern Canada extending from British Columbia, through the prairies, and into the Great Lakes region is significantly influenced by the SO phenomenon. The results show a distinct pattern of negative (positive) precipitation anomalies in this region during the first winter following the onset of El Nino (La Nina) events. During this same period, significant positive precipitation anomalies occur over the northern prairies and southeastern Northwest Territories in association with El Nino events. Statistical significance of the responses is tested by the Student's t-test and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, while field significance is established through the Monte Carlo procedure. All of the significant precipitation anomalies can be explained by the associated upper-atmospheric Bow patterns, which during the first winter following the onset of El Nino (La Nina) events resemble the positive (negative) phase of the Pacific-North American (PNA) pattern. Significant correlations between Southern Oscillation index (SOI) values and the observed precipitation anomalies over southern Canada suggest the possibility of developing a long-range forecasting technique for Canadian precipitation based on the occurrence and evolution of the various phases of the SO.																			0894-8755					DEC	1997	10	12					3016	3027		10.1175/1520-0442(1997)010<3016:CPPAWT>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0442(1997)010<3016:CPPAWT>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000071532800003

Systematic CFD-based evaluation of physical factors influencing the spatiotemporal distribution patterns of microplastic particles in lakes	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Spatiotemporal distribution patterns of microplastic (MP) particles in lakes hinge on both the physical conditions in the lake and particle properties. Using numerical simulations, we systematically investigated the influence of lake depth and bathymetry, wind and temperature conditions, MP particle release location and timing, as well as particle diameter (10, 20, and 50 mu m). Our results indicate that maximum lake depth had the greatest effect on the residence time in the water column, as it determines the settling timescale and occurrence of hydrodynamic complexity such as density-driven flows in the lake. Increasing particle size from 10 to 20 and 50 mu m also significantly reduced the residence time making particle size the factor with the second strongest effect on the residence time and, in turn, on the availability of MP particles for uptake by organisms. Changing bathymetry from a uniform to a non -uniform had a less pronounced effect on particle residence time compared to maximum depth and particle size. Release location, wind conditions, and release time had comparably little effect on particle behavior but became more important as MP particle size decreased. The release of the 10 mu m MP particles in the deeper lakes with uniform bathymetry during summer with stable thermal stratification, resulted in a nearly month-long turnover phase in the fall in which both settling and rising of particles occurred simultaneously. This was caused by convective heat and water transport during this period. In these scenarios about 2.6 to 5.4 % of the released MP particles were held in or returned to the water layers near the lake surface. While acknowledging the dominant role of lake depth and MP particle size on the particle residence time, this study further emphasizes that it is ultimately a particular combination of different factors and their interactions that shape MP distribution patterns in lakes.

Island characteristics and species traits predict mammal diversity across islands of the great lakes of North America	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Island biogeography theory states biodiversity increases with island size and decreases with distance from mainland source populations; however, the influence of other island characteristics (e.g., presence of neighboring islands) and species traits (e.g., body size) could alter expected patterns. We assessed the influence of island characteristics and species traits on island biodiversity using presence data for 20 mammal species on 70 islands across the Great Lakes of North America. We collated presence data from public databases of species distributions, a literature review, and personal communications with resource managers and researchers. As predicted, islands closer to mainland source populations as well as islands and archipelagoes with larger areas supported greater mammalian species richness. Winter dormant species (e.g., American black bear [Ursus americanus]) occurred less on islands while semiaquatic species (e.g., American beaver [Castor canadensis]) occurred more. Our results broadly support island biogeography theory and highlight the importance of considering archipelago characteristics and species traits for describing island biodiversity. Specifically, we found support for the existence of archipelagic meta-communities whereby archipelago area was a better predictor of mammalian species richness than the area of individual islands and further support for the effects of winter dormancy and semiaquatic lifestyles as species traits predictive of mammal occurrence on islands. Our results may aid restoration and conservation planning including consideration of assisted colonization and invasive species precautions. Further, our dataset provides an important baseline for mammal diversity and distributions in the Great Lakes region.

Variations in mean monthly temperature and precipitation at Reykjahlid (Myvatn) are compared with variations at seven other weather stations in north east Iceland. The area is drier and colder than coastal stations and exhibits a seasonal cycle in temperature that is larger than found at the coast. The temperature is significantly influenced by the number of sunlight hours only during the summer months. During summer, the influence of a sea breeze circulation can be clearly identified. The variability of climate since 1936 is also examined in comparison with the seven other weather stations. It is found that temperature variations at the different stations are highly correlated, but for precipitation the correlation is significant but much weaker. The influence of the large scale atmospheric circulation on temperature and precipitation at Lake Myvatn is also examined. It is found that the air temperature at Lake Myvatn is most sensitive to an east-west dipole in the large scale sea surface pressure field, i.e. to a pattern that is very different from the spatial pattern associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Precipitation at Lake Myvatn is to some degree influenced by the NAO, but generally precipitation is associated with northerly winds and cold temperatures whereas southerly winds at Lake Myvatn are likely to be drier.																			1386-2588	1573-5125					2004	38	2					129	144		10.1023/B:AECO.0000032061.51508.e6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:AECO.0000032061.51508.e6													WOS:000222064400004

Asurface-based aerosol layer was present during much of the winter. Comparisons were made between ceilometer-measured and visual characteristics of the aerosol layers. A 3-4 January 2011 case study illustrated the meteorological value of time-height backscatter cross sections when used as a base map for meteorological analyses. A variety of meteorological mixing processes were illustrated using ceilometer backscatter data. The mean altitude of the top of the aerosol layer during undisturbed subperiods of the 1 December-7 February experimental period was 1811 m MSL, with a standard deviation of 185 m. The mean aerosol depth was similar to 500m AGL in the 1200-m-deep valley. There was surprisingly little variation in the wintertime aerosol layer depth despite large variations in bulk atmospheric stability and ground-based fine particulate matter concentrations.																			1558-8424	1558-8432				APR	2015	54	4					752	765		10.1175/JAMC-D-14-0115.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JAMC-D-14-0115.1													WOS:000353576200004

Earlier efforts have been made to quantity the size and potential release of internal nutrient pools in lakes. Yet, links among substrates, microbial processes, and the size and actual release of internal nutrient pools remain largely unclear. To assess the links, sediment organic matter in Lake Taihu, China, was characterized by combining optical measurements, and lake-wide sediment gross nitrogen (N) transformations were measured using the stable isotope (15N) dilution technique. Meanwhile, respirations and nutrient fluxes across the sediment-water interface (SWI) were measured by conducting intact core continuousflow incubations. The cause-effect relationships among sediment physicochemical parameters (especially organic matter properties), gross N transformations, extractable nutrient concentrations, and nutrient fluxes across the SWI were revealed by partial least square path models. Results showed that environmental controls on the N transformation rates at different seasons varied, with sediment-derived dissolved organic matter abundance being more important than other variables in driving the rates during summer blooms. This study put a step toward revealing the significant positive effects of sediment organic matter mineralization on porewater nutrient concentrations and then on nutrient fluxes across the SWI at late season. The significant positive correlation between the gross N mineralization rates and ammonium fluxes across the SWI and the estimated considerable volume of net N mineralization in summer further suggested that algal blooms can get substantial inorganic N from sediment N mineralization during the lake N limitation period. Overall, this paper presents new insights into the substrates- and microbial process-driven internal nutrient loading of shallow lakes, which is the fundamental driving force of internal nutrient loading formation.

However, the seasonal cycles of lakes on the TP have received little attention due to high cloud contamination of the commonly-used optical images. In this study, for the first time, the seasonal cycle of lakes on the TP was detected using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data with a high repeat cycle. A total of approximately 6000 Level-1 scenes were obtained that covered all large lakes (>50 km(2)) in the study area. The images were extracted from stripmap (SM) and interferometric wide swath (IW) modes that had a pixel spacing of 40 m in the range and azimuth directions. The lake boundaries extracted from Sentinel-1 data using the algorithm developed in this study were in good agreement with in-situ measurements of lake shoreline, lake outlines delineated from the corresponding Landsat images in 2015 and lake levels for Qinghai Lake. Upon analysis, it was found that the seasonal cycles of lakes exhibited drastically different patterns across the TP. For example, large size lakes (>100 km(2)) reached their peaks in August-September while lakes with areas of 50-100 km(2) reached their peaks in early June-July. The peaks of seasonal cycles for endorheic lakes were more pronounced than those for exorheic lakes with flat peaks, and glacier-fed lakes with additional supplies of water exhibited delayed peaks in their seasonal cycles relative to those of non-glacier-fed lakes. Large-scale atmospheric circulation systems, such as the westerlies, Indian summer monsoon, transition in between, and East Asian summer monsoon, were also found to affect the seasonal cycles of lakes. The results of this study suggest that Sentinel-1 SAR data are a powerful tool that can be used to fill gaps in intra-annual lake observations. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Salonen, E				Salonen, Erno			Vendace (Coregonus albula) in Lake Inari - what has changed in 50 years?	ANNALES ZOOLOGICI FENNICI												Lake Inari is a subarctic, oligotrophic, regulated lake in northern Finland, connected via the Paatsjoki (Pasvik) River to the Arctic Ocean. A new coregonid species, the vendace (Coregonus albula). was introduced into the watershed in the 1960s and gradually established a population in the lake becoming part of its ecosystem. The annual vendace catch in 1989 reached 300 tonnes, while during the following 25 years the vendace catches declined stabilizing at a very low level. Vendace introduction radically changed the fishing practices within a short time, and its population became fimily established in the lake. It benefited both fisheries and predatory fishes. especially salmonids. The vendace year-class strength varied greatly between 1983 and 2019. According to winter seine CPUE data, the strongest year-classes were up to 100 times greater than the weakest ones. Winter seine CPUE of one-year-old fish correlated positively with catches in the coming years. The growth data for the period 2015-2021 revealed a decrease in the youngest vendace age-groups.																			0003-455X	1797-2450				AUG	2021	58	4-6					243	253		10.5735/086.058.0410	http://dx.doi.org/10.5735/086.058.0410													WOS:000694007600010
J	Li, YP; Acharya, K; Yu, ZB				Li, Yiping; Acharya, Kumud; Yu, Zhongbo			Modeling impacts of Yangtze River water transfer on water ages in Lake Taihu, China	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												To improve water quality and alleviate eutrophication in Lake Taihu, the third largest freshwater lake in China, a Yangtze River water transfer project was initiated in 2002 to bring water from the Yangtze River to Lake Taihu to dilute and divert pollutants out of the lake. We used a three-dimensional numerical model, Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code, to study the impacts of water transfer on the transport of dissolved substances in the lake by using the concept of water age. In particular, the influences of inflow tributaries and wind forcing on water age were investigated. Model results showed that the effect of water transfer on transport processes in the lake is strongly influenced by hydrodynamic conditions induced by wind and inflow/outflow tributaries. During the simulation year (2005), the water ages in Lake Taihu were highly variable both spatially and temporally, with a mean of approximately 130 days in summer and 230 days in the other seasons. Southeasterly winds-dominant in the summer-could improve the quality of water by reducing the water age in the eastern areas of the lake, which are used as a drinking water source, and in Meiliang Bay, the most polluted bay. In terms of dilution, the most efficient flow rate for transferred water was predicted to be approximately 100 m(3)/s. The spatial distribution of water ages showed that water transfer may preferentially enhance exchanges in some areas of the lake unless nutrient concentrations in the transferred water are reduced to a reasonable level. This study provides useful information for a better understanding of the complex hydrodynamic and mass transport processes in the lake, which is important for developing and implementing effective ecological restoration strategies in the region.

To test whether allochthonous leaf litter (LL) inputs fuel this excess, we quantified leaf litterfall, leaching and decomposition kinetics, and measured the impact of organic amendments on production, germination and cell growth, using pyrosequencing to track changes in microbial community composition. Coniferous leaves in BSL exhibited high mass loss rates during leaching and decomposition, likely due to a combination of chemical hydrolysis and contributions of both introduced and endemic microbes. We measured very low in situ(3)H-thymidine incorporation over hours by the dominant chemolithotroph Acidimicrobium (13-65gCL(-1)day(-1)), which was inhibited by simple C sources (acetate, glucose). Longer term incubations with additions of 0.01-0.02% complex C/N sources induced germination of the Firmicute Alicyclobacillus within 1-2days, as well as growth of Acetobacteraceae after 3-4days. LL additions yielded the opposite successional patterns of these r-selected heterotrophs, boosting production to 30-150gCL(-1)day(-1). Growth and germination studies suggest both prokaryotes and fungi likely consume allochthonous organics, and might be novel sources of lignocellulose-degrading enzymes. A model of BSL's C budget supports the hypothesis that allochthonous inputs fuel seasonal microbial heterotrophy, but that dissolved organic C sources greatly exceed direct LL inputs.

J	Skowron, R				Skowron, Rajmund			Water temperature in the lakes of Northern Poland during the bathing season	BULLETIN OF GEOGRAPHY-PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY SERIES												The study presents characteristics of the bathing season on the basis of stationary daily measurements of surface water temperature in the lakes in the period 1971-2015 conducted by the Institute of Meteorology and Water Management. These measurements were taken in the littoral zone (from bridges) of 28 lakes at 7: 00 (6: 00 GMT). In order to determine representativeness of these measurements, the author also documents the comparison of water temperature with its values at various points of the lake and its daily course. Stationary surface water temperature measurements provided the basis for the characteristics of the average, the earliest and the latest dates of the beginning and end of the bathing seasons, their duration and mean water temperatures in the summer months. Hence, a new parameter (t sum) is introduced to define the mean surface water temperature for the summer months (June, July and August), and compare water temperature in lakes over a larger area (the Baltic Sea catchment area). The most favorable conditions for bathing in Polish lakes are found in the western part of the Wielkopolskie Lakeland (lakelands: Lagowskie, Poznanskie, Slawskie) from the beginning of July to the end of August, when the surface water temperature in lakes generally exceeds 18 degrees C. Furthermore, the best conditions for bathing in the water are from 10: 00 to 18: 00. When choosing a place to relax, holidaymakers should also consider bathing locations, infrastructure and safety conditions.																			2080-7686	2300-8490				DEC	2018	15	1					75	90		10.2478/bgeo-2018-0017	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/bgeo-2018-0017													WOS:000454199900007

The purpose of this study is to explore the interactions between urban overheating and HWs in Sydney, which is under the influence of two synoptic circulation systems. For this purpose, a detailed analysis has been performed for the city of Sydney, while considering an urban (Observatory Hill), in the Central Business District (CBD), and a non-urban station in Western Sydney (Penrith Lakes). Summer 2017 was considered as a study period, and HW and Non-Heatwave (NHW) periods were identified to explore the interactions between urban overheating and HWs. A strong link was observed between urban overheating and HWs, and the difference between the peak average urban overheating magnitude during HWs and NHWs was around 8 degrees C. Additionally, the daytime urban overheating effect was more pronounced during the HWs when compared to nighttime. The advective flux was found as the most important interaction between urban overheating and HWs, in addition to the sensible and latent heat fluxes.

Water quality data including total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and dissolved oxygen; local meteorology data; and global climate trends were examined to reveal the factors influencing the formation of the algal blooms. Results for the 2000-2011 study period show that the annual algal bloom typically begins between March and May in Taihu Lake. All large-scale blooms originate from northern Taihu Lake (Meiliang Bay and Zhushan Bay). Some small-scale blooms originate from southwestern Taihu Lake, but the duration of these blooms is very brief because of episodes of turbulent mixing due to high wind speed. Nutrient supply is the main factor influencing algal mass propagation during bloom periods, and temperature changes may trigger algal recovery. The algal bloom area significantly decreased when wind speed is greater than 4 m/s, causing turbulence and changes in algal buoyancy. A strong East Asian summer monsoon transporting warm air to the lake is shown to extend the duration of algal blooms in Taihu Lake, as occurred in 2007.					huang, changchun/E-6580-2016; huang, Changchun/E-6580-2016; yu, zhaoyuan/H-8800-2012	huang, changchun/0000-0002-4704-548X; huang, changchun/0000-0002-9833-5663; 													1866-6280	1866-6299				APR	2014	71	8					3705	3714		10.1007/s12665-013-2764-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-013-2764-6													WOS:000333475800034
J	Harrison, SSC				Harrison, SSC			The importance of aquatic margins to invertebrates in English chalk streams	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Standardized kick-sweep samples of invertebrates were taken from three habitats - mid-channel gravel, Ranunculus and marginal vegetation - in six lowland chalk streams, on four sampling occasions between May 1996 and January 1997. Several types of marginal vegetation were sampled, including the stems and leaves of trailing terrestrial vegetation and semi-emergent marginal macrophytes. There was little difference in invertebrate community composition between the different marginal vegetation types, despite fine-scale differences in habitat architecture. The invertebrate communities in mid-channel gravel, Ranunculus and marginal vegetation were very different from each other over most of the year, particularly in spring and winter. Each habitat. was characterised by a suite of invertebrates, reflecting the physical and biological differences between the habitats. Community diversity and equitability were greatest in the physically complex margins and least in the more simply structured Ranunculus. Invertebrate abundance per sample was greatest in Ranunculus. Approximately one half of all taxa in the chalk streams showed no significant preference for any single habitat. Of those taxa that: significantly preferred one habitat, many more preferred marginal vegetation compared to either gravel or Ranunculus. Many taxa found throughout the investigation avoided gravel and Ranunculus, but very few taxa avoided marginal vegetation. Rare taxa also occurred more frequently in the margins. Marginal vegetation was used by invertebrates both as a favoured site of oviposition and as a conduit between the aquatic and terrestrial environments. Margins thus acted as a focus for reproduction and recruitment for chalk streams. The relative importance of marginal vegetation for stream invertebrate biodiversity and reproduction is high relative to other mid-channel habitats. More attention should be given to this habitat than has been in the past, particularly in the fields of stream conservation and restoration.																			0003-9136					SEP	2000	149	2					213	240																WOS:000089972500003
J	Renaut, RW; Jones, B; Le Turdu, C				Renaut, RW; Jones, B; Le Turdu, C			Calcite lilypads and ledges at Lorusio hot springs, Kenya Rift Valley: travertine precipitation at the air-water interface	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												Travertine forming at Lorusio Hot Springs in the northern Kenya Rift is constructed mainly by lilypads and ledges. The lilypads are flat, accretionary structures rooted to the substrate that are composed mostly of platy calcite crystals. They grow outward from a nucleus, subparallel to the water surface, at or just below the air-water interface. Precipitation results from rapid degassing of CO2. Ledges, which have a similar morphology and internal structure, are attached to the margin of a spring pool or outflow channel. As they grow laterally, lilypads and ledges may coalesce with their neighbours to produce thin (1-3 cm) beds of travertine, examples of which are exposed in subfossil deposits at the site. Once established, lilypads and ledges modify the outflow and can act as substrates for precipitation of other minerals and colonization by microbes on their cooler subaerial surfaces. Pore fluids are drawn upward through the lilypads by capillary evaporation. Amorphous silica then precipitates as surficial crusts upon microbial mats or forms spicular microstromatolites, some of which also contain calcite laminae. Efflorescent Na-CO3 salts commonly encrust the drier central platforms of the exposed lilypad. The unusual abundance of lilypads and ledges at Lorusio reflects (i) the low-relief setting and the hydrostatic head, which limit terrace development, and (ii) the high temperature (>75 degrees C) of the waters, which inhibits colonization by microbial mats at crystal growth sites. Similar structures form in cave pools, evaporating brines, and freezing water at sites where precipitation is induced by several processes active at the air-water interface.

Archaeology, hydrogeology and geomythology in the Stymphalos valley	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE-REPORTS												This paper uses the results of recent excavations of the city of Stymphalos and environmental studies on the floor of the Stymphalos polje to examine the role of both the lake and springs in the history of the classical city. Associated with Artemis and famed for Herakles' sixth labour ( killing of the Stymphalian birds), the city has a rich ( geo) mythology. While this narrative has been associated solely with the lake, it is argued here that this geomythology was part of the city's relationship to environmental unpredictability and the relationship between water supply and water loss. Seen in this context, the construction of the fountain-house above the contemporary lakeshore is symbolic of the importance of springs to the foundation and sustainability of the classical city during both the Greek and Roman Periods. Through these archaeological and environmental analyses, we seek to illustrate the complimentary, but complex nature of archaeological, hydrogeological and palae oenvironmental data that intersect in the geomythological landscapes of Mediterranean antiquity.

We compared N-2 fixation with dissolved inorganic N (DIN) uptake fluxes in several streams. We measured N-2 fixation in nine streams in Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming, USA and surrounding areas and we compared our estimates to the ammonium (NH4+) uptake, nitrate (NO3) uptake, and denitrification estimates from the literature for those streams. N-2 fixation was negligible or below detection in the four streams with NO3- concentrations >20 mu g NO3--N L-1 center dot N-2 fixation exceeded NO3- uptake in two of the nine streams and NH4+ uptake in one stream. To further examine the relationship between N-2 fixation and DIN uptake, we chose Ditch Creek, which is a low-N stream (<5 mu g DIN-N L-1) with high rates of N-2 fixation. We measured N-2 fixation, NH4+ uptake, and NO3+ uptake biweekly throughout one summer. In Ditch Creek, DIN uptake exceeded N-2 fixation at the beginning and end of the summer, but from July to the beginning of September N-2 fixation was up to eight times greater than DIN uptake. The epilithic biofilm in Ditch Creek accumulated 1.5 g N m(-2) throughout the summer, and N-2 fixation may have contributed up to 73 % of that accumulation. Ditch Creek N2 fixation surpassed denitrification for both Ditch Creek and many streams. N-2 fixation can be a dominant flux in low-N stream ecosystems.

J	Smith, IR				Smith, IR			Diatom-based holocene paleoenvironmental records from continental sites on northeastern Ellesmere Island, high Arctic, Canada	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Stratigraphic changes in diatom assemblages from four small lakes on northeastern Ellesmere Island, high Arctic, Canada, provide a proxy lake-ice cover and paleoenvironmental record. Low absolute diatom abundances and a benthic Fragilaria (sensu lata) dominated assemblage during the postglacial (< 7.6 ka B.P.) to mid-Holocene record the moderating effects of locally retreating glaciers. Around 5.5 ka B.P. diatom concentrations begin to rise, reaching their highest levels (10(9) valves per g dry sediment) between 4.2 and 3 ka B.P., interpreted to be the warmest period in this region. Topoclimatic differences between lakes on Hazen Plateau and those lower in Lake Hazen Basin account for the initial decline in diatom abundances in the upper lakes after 3 ka B.P. This change is thought to reflect a lowering of the regional snowline, accordant with widely recognized Neoglacial advances on Ellesmere Island and Greenland. Lakes in lower Lake Hazen Basin maintained extensive summer ice free conditions until similar to 1.9 ka B.P., after which diatom abundances declined, suggesting prolonged summer lake-ice cover through the remainder of the recovered Holocene record. Differences between the records presented here and those from coastal areas of the Canadian high Arctic highlight the unique topoclimatic characteristics and continentality of the Lake Hazen region, and possible effects that local marine environments may have had on coastal records. Such differences serve to demonstrate the inherent geographic variability of paleoenvironmental records from the high Arctic.																			0921-2728					JAN	2002	27	1					9	28		10.1023/A:1013514305420	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1013514305420													WOS:000173086500002
J	Lind, L; Alfredsen, K; Kuglerová, L; Nilsson, C				Lind, Lovisa; Alfredsen, Knut; Kuglerova, Lenka; Nilsson, Christer			Hydrological and thermal controls of ice formation in 25 boreal stream reaches	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The Northern Hemisphere has a high density of fluvial freshwater ecosystems, many of which become ice-covered during winter. The development and extent of ice have both ecological and socio-economic implications. For example, ice can cause freezing of riparian vegetation and fish eggs as well as influence hydropower production; however, when, where and why ice develops in small streams is not well known. We used observations from 25 stream reaches to study the factors controlling ice development during two consecutive winters, addressing where in the catchment surface or anchor-ice is most likely to develop, how stream morphology influences ice formation, and how climate influences ice processes. Reaches far downstream from lake outlets, or without any upstream lakes, were most prone to develop anchor-ice, but other factors also influenced ice formation. Anchor-ice was most common where water temperature and groundwater inputs were low and stream power high. Given cold air temperature and water supercooling, the in-stream substrate as well as the current velocity were also important for the development of anchor-ice. Climate and substrate seemed to be important factors for the development of surface ice. This study shows that ice processes are substantial during the hydrological year and may therefore have large implications for the ecology and engineering around boreal streams.. The study also demonstrates that ice formation in the studied streams was complex, involving many variables and physical processes. We constructed a conceptual model describing the likelihood for various ice types to develop, based on the large dataset. As such, this model will be useful for practitioners and scientists working in small watercourses in the Northern Hemisphere. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

L22209	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Oxygen isotope values of meteoric precipitation (delta(18)O) are strongly influenced by water vapor source and trajectory history, and can therefore be used as a tool for the reconstruction of atmospheric circulation. However, this approach requires an understanding of how differing patterns of atmospheric circulation influence precipitation delta(18)O. This study examines the relationship between atmospheric circulation and winter precipitation delta(18)O in central New York State. Circulation back trajectories, weather maps, and delta(18)O values for 132 precipitation samples were examined to determine the circulation type for each event. Lake-effect precipitation, which generated the lowest delta(18)O values, featured low pressure over New England and northwesterly flow over the Great Lakes. Events with the highest delta(18)O values were associated with low pressure north of New York and strong southerly flow within the warm sector. Less frequent were the Atlantic coastal and warm frontal overrunning events, both of which yielded relatively depleted precipitation.					; Burnett, Adam/ABE-4249-2020; Patterson, William/J-6473-2012	Patterson, William/0000-0003-3387-708X; 													0094-8276	1944-8007				NOV 25	2004	31	22							L22209	10.1029/2004GL021089	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2004GL021089													WOS:000225429100004

This work examines the degree to which replacing conventionally powered vehicles with electric vehicles (EV) could reduce the near-road accumulation of criteria pollutants under various degrees of inversion depth and wind speed. Vehicle emissions data are combined with inversion and wind factors to determine changes in the Air Quality Index, and a first-order estimate of the cost required to build an EV charging infrastructure to support a given EV adoption scenario is also derived. Results are presented in the form of multiple Pareto frontiers and a simplified cost-benefit formula that inform potential public and private EV charging infrastructure investments to drive the EV adoption that would result in optimal air quality improvements during average weather and winter inversion events.																			2032-6653					DEC	2021	12	4							207	10.3390/wevj12040207	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/wevj12040207													WOS:000937534900048
J	Elo, PAR				Elo, P. Aija-Riitta			The energy balance and vertical thermal structure of two small boreal lakes in summer	BOREAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												Two small lakes in Sweden were studied using one-dimensional approach. Their summer energy balance and temperature structure were considered based on measurements and on modelling on different scales. Tamnaren is a vertically-mixed lake because it is very shallow and has a large surface area. Raksjo is small, sheltered and typically stratified during summer. Model adjustments and calibrations were made using detailed micrometeorological input data, considering areal variations. Components of the heat balance were determined in order to solve for water temperature and heat exchange. Absorption of energy inside water was determined on the basis of measurements. The vertical temperature structure was solved using a k epsilon-model. The results clearly show that sheltering caused by shores must be taken into account. Modifying the wind speed has a strong effect on temperature, especially at greater depths, and on heat balance. An isothermal box lake model, the SLAB model, was used with the same input. Surface temperature is strongly influenced by meteorological conditions, and both models solve it very similarly. Diurnal temperature variations, which can be as much as several degrees, are lost with the SLAB model. The PROBE model is able to solve these variations and the vertical temperature profile. However, if the important boundary effects are not taken into account, neither can be solved satisfactorily. Point measurements gave a residual of -53 W m(-2) for Tamnaren, and -42 W m(-2) for Raksjo. When wind was reduced to 80% for Tamnaren, and 60% for Raksjo to account for the net areal effect, the residuals were 0 and -1 W m(-2) for the lakes. Temperature profiles were also satisfactorily solved.																			1239-6095	1797-2469				OCT 24	2007	12	5					585	600																WOS:000250660400005
J	DAY, JA				DAY, JA			THE MAJOR ION CHEMISTRY OF SOME SOUTHERN AFRICAN SALINE SYSTEMS	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Africa south of about 23-degrees-S has few natural athalassic lakes, saline or freshwater. South Africa, however, is rich in temporary pans, many of which are saline, while permanent saline springs occur along the coastal strip of the Namib Desert in Namibia. This paper examines the chemistry of the major ions in 67 Namibian waters, 47 of which have not previously been reported in the literature, and compares them with 66 South African waters, five of which have not previously been reported, and with saline lakes in East Africa. The highest value for total dissolved solids in South African waters was 276 g l-1 (Koekiespan, south-western Cape) and the highest for Namibian waters were 160 g l-1 (Hosabes, a small spring on a gypsous crust) and 302 g l-1 (a salt pan at Oranjemund at the mouth of the Orange River). The dominant ions in fresh waters in the region are Ca2+ and HCO3-/CO32- in the interior and in Namibia, and Na2+ and Cl+ on the south and east coasts. Regardless of the geochemistry of their substrata, the dominant ions in the saline waters throughout the region are Na+ and Cl-. Thus differential precipitation of CaCO3 and CaSO4, as a result of evaporative concentration at high salinities, appears to be the determinant of the proportions of the major ions in these systems. The permanent springs on gypsous crusts along the coast of Namibia, although dominated by Na+ and Cl- ions, contain considerable quantities of both Ca2+ and SO42- ions.																			0018-8158					SEP 10	1993	267	1-3					37	59		10.1007/BF00018790	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00018790													WOS:A1993MB13700004

High frequency, large amplitude variations in carbon isotopes during the 8.2 ka event, coupled with pulsed increases in phosphorus concentrations, indicate more frequent or intense winter storms on the California coast. Decreased magnesium-calcium ratios point toward a sustained increase in effective moisture during the event, however the magnitude of change in Mg/Ca suggests this event was not as pronounced on the western North American coast as anomalies seen in the high northern latitudes and monsoon-influenced areas. Nevertheless, shifts in the White Moon Cave record that are synchronous within age uncertainties with cooling of Greenland, and changes in global monsoon systems, suggest rapid changes in atmospheric circulation occurred in response to freshwater input and associated cooling in the North Atlantic region. Our record is consistent with intensification of the Pacific winter storm track in response to North Atlantic freshwater forcing, a mechanism suggested by simulations of the last deglaciation, and indicates this intensification led to increases in precipitation and infiltration along the California coast during the Holocene.

High-resolution leaf wax carbon and hydrogen isotopic record of the late Holocene paleoclimate in arid Central Asia	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												Central Asia is located at the confluence of large-scale atmospheric circulation systems. It is thus likely to be highly susceptible to changes in the dynamics of those systems; however, little is still known about the regional paleoclimate history. Here we present carbon and hydrogen isotopic compositions of n-alkanoic acids from a late Holocene sediment core from Lake Karakuli (eastern Pamir, Xinjiang Province, China). Instrumental evidence and isotopeenabled climate model experiments with the Laboratoire de Meteorologie Dynamique Zoom model version 4 (LMDZ4) demonstrate that delta D values of precipitation in the region are influenced by both temperature and precipitation amount. We find that these parameters are inversely correlated on an annual scale, i.e., the climate has varied between relatively cool and wet and more warm and dry over the last 50 years. Since the isotopic signals of these changes are in the same direction and therefore additive, isotopes in precipitation are sensitive recorders of climatic changes in the region. Additionally, we infer that plants use year-round precipitation (including snowmelt), and thus leaf wax delta D values must also respond to shifts in the proportion of moisture derived from westerly storms during late winter and early spring. Downcore results give evidence for a gradual shift to cooler and wetter climates between 3.5 and 2.5 cal kyr BP, interrupted by a warm and dry episode between 3.0 and 2.7 kyr BP. Further cool and wet episodes occur between 1.9 and 1.5 and between 0.6 and 0.1 kyr BP, the latter coeval with the Little Ice Age. Warm and dry episodes from 2.5 to 1.9 and 1.5 to 0.6 kyr BP coincide with the Roman Warm Period and Medieval Climate Anomaly, respectively. Finally, we find a drying tend in recent decades. Regional comparisons lead us to infer that the strength and position of the westerlies, and wider northern hemispheric climate dynamics, control climatic shifts in arid Central Asia, leading to complex local responses. Our new archive from Lake Karakuli provides a detailed record of the local signatures of these climate transitions in the eastern Pamir.

Incision of alluvial channels in response to a continuous base level fall: Field characterization, modeling, and validation along the Dead Sea	GEOMORPHOLOGY												The dramatic lake level drop of the Dead Sea during the twentieth century (similar to 30 m) provides a field-scale experiment in transport-limited incision of gravel-bed channels in response to quasi-continuous base level fall at approximately constant rate. We apply a one-dimensional numerical incision model based on a linear diffusion equation to seven ephemeral channels draining into the Dead Sea. The model inputs include the measured twentieth century lake level curve, annual shoreline location (i.e., annual channel lengthening following the lake level drop), reconstructed longitudinal profiles of each of the channels based on mapped and surveyed terraces, and the current profiles of the active channels. The model parameters included the diffusion coefficient and the upstream-derived sediment flux. Both were first calibrated using a set of longitudinal profiles of known ages and then validated using additional sets of longitudinal profiles. The maximum at-station total incision observed at each of the studied channels was significantly less then the total lake level drop and varied in response to both drainage area and lake bathymetry. The model applied predicted degradation rates and the pattern of degradation with high accuracy. This suggests that sediment flux in the modeled channels is indeed linearly dependent on slope. Further support for this linear dependency is provided by a linear correlation between the diffusion coefficient and the mean annual rain volume over each basin (a proxy for discharge). The model presented could be a valuable tool for planning in rapid base level fall environments where incision may risk infrastructure. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Polesel, MGI; Poi, ASG				Ibarra Polesel, Mario Gabriel; Guadalupe Poi, Alicia Susana			Feeding of Characidium rachovii (Characiformes: Crenuchidae) and Pyrrhulina australis (Characiformes: Lebiasinidae) in shallow lakes of Corrientes, Argentina	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												Fishes display diverse feeding strategies that may undergo modifications through ontogeny or seasonally with ecological implications in the food webs. Even though the significance of fishes as top predators is recognized, the diet of many of them is still scarcely known; especially in fish that inhabit shallow lakes densely vegetated. The aim of this study was to investigate the diet of Characidium rachovii and Pyrrhulina australis of different size classes (I, II and III); during winter and summer, and estimate their trophic niche breadth. The field work was carried out in two shallow lakes fed by rain (Soto and Pampin lake, Corrientes province), from July 2011 to August 2012. The stomach contents of 104 individuals of C. rachovii and 91 specimens of P. australis were examined. Accumulation curve showed that the number of analyzed stomachs was representative for both species. Twenty three food items for C. rachovii and twenty eight for P. australis were recognized in the gut contents. According to the index of relative importance (IRI), both species feed preferably on cladocerans and midges (Chironomidae), and both species showed a large overlap in their diets (85 %), according to Morisita index. However the diversity of food items and the trophic niche breadth of P. australis (D-1 = 8.86; B = 4.76) were higher than C. rachovii (D-1 = 3.37; B = 2.25). Significant differences were observed in the diet of three sizes of P. australis (chi 2, p < 0.01) and between the sizes I and III of C. rachovii (chi 2, p = 0.03). In both species the diversity of food items increased with increasing their size. Between seasons, the diet differences were significant for both species (chi 2, p < 0.0001). The high feeding overlap indicates that both species mostly use the same resources. Notwithstanding this, both the number of food items as the diversity and breadth of the trophic niche, suggest that these species use different feeding strategies, C. rachovii showed a trend towards specialization in microcrustacean consumption; while P. australis exhibited a broader trophic spectrum, incorporating insects from littoral areas and from the terrestrial community. The loss of the trophic dominant resource, by increasing urbanization on the margin of the studied shallow lakes, could lead to increased competition, due to the wide diet overlap in both species.

This fault, herein named the South Virgin-White Hills detachment, comprises the Lakeside Mine, Salt Spring, and the Cyclopic Mine faults, and it extends from the South Virgin Mountains in southeastern Nevada to the central White Hills in northwestern Arizona.

Multiple environmental stressors mediate cyanobacteria recruitment in microcosms simulating spring conditions from two Midwest US hypereutrophic reservoirs	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Cyanobacteria harmful algal blooms (cyanoHABs) are a complex threat to water quality. Most research to date on the drivers of cyanoHABs focuses on environmental factors in the typical "growing season" despite evidence that cyanobacteria overwintering dynamics may have substantial effects on cyanobacteria seasonal succession and bloom formation. Additionally, the growing season is now beginning earlier and ending later in many parts of the world. Here, we examine the impacts of light, temperature and nutrients on the magnitude and timing of cyanobacteria recruitment from sediments in two hypereutrophic reservoirs in the Midwestern USA in the early spring season via microcosm recruitment experiments. We observed that recruitment was greatest at the first sampling point (Day 3), then declined throughout the rest of the 18-day experiment for both reservoirs. Further, increasing light and temperature significantly promoted recruitment in both systems, while nutrient additions were only a significant driver of recruitment in one lake. The recruited cyanobacteria community identity was similar in both lakes, with Planktothrix, Raphidiopsis and Pseudanabaena being most abundant. This study highlights the complex, interactive effects of environmental variables on cyanobacteria recruitment.

J	Rao, YR; Murthy, CR				Rao, YR; Murthy, CR			Nearshore currents and turbulent exchange processes during upwelling and downwelling events in Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												The nearshore circulation and exchange processes during summer stratification and certain episodic events like upwelling and downwelling have been examined using a time series data of horizontal, velocity and temperature profiles in Lake Ontario. The primary peak of spectral energy of currents and temperature for the summer season is located at a period of 10-12 days corresponding to the large-scale response of the lake due to meteorological forcing and the propagation of internal Kelvin waves. A secondary peak of spectral energy of coastal currents is situated near the inertial frequency band. Each upwelling and downwelling episode along the western Lake Ontario has lasted for nearly 4-6 days under the influence of prevailing winds. Currents associated with downwelling cycles are slightly stronger than currents associated with upwelling events. Although the kinetic energy associated with alongshore currents is generally higher, cross-shore flow exhibited higher energy at middle and lower levels during these episodes. The alongshore horizontal exchange coefficients are generally higher than the cross-shore component. However, during upwelling episodes, horizontal exchange coefficients are reduced in the surface layers and increased in the bottom layers. Full upwelling events are characterized with weak static stability and reduced vertical current shear in surface layers. Near bottom layers are affected by intense turbulence associated with increased vertical current shear. During downwelling events with migration and intersection of the thermocline with the bottom, vertical exchange coefficients are relatively small due to weak turbulent activity.

It shares with chain danios (D. assamila, D. dangila, D. catenatus, D. concatenatus, and D. sysphigmatus) a colour pattern consisting of series of dark rings with light interspaces along the side, complete lateral line, 14 circumpeduncular scales, a produced first ray in the pectoral fin, and a black humeral spot. It differs from other chain danios in possessing much shorter pectoral and pelvic fins, and a humeral spot that is slightly wider than deep instead of round or deeper than wide. The mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) sequence separates D. annulosus from the most similar species, D. catenatus by a p-distance of 3.4%.

J	Stambuk-Giljanovic, N				Stambuk-Giljanovic, N			The water quality of the Vrgorska Matica River	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The article presents the results of investigations carried out on the 42 km long Vrgorska Matica River, which flows through the 15 km long Vrgorsko polje (polje = field) which covers an area of 3000 ha, and is at 24 m a.s.l., located in Southern Croatia. It covers the years 1997-2000 after this field had been reclaimed for agricultural use. The purpose of the investigations was to evaluate the influence of the Vrgorska Matica River which is part of the catchment area of the Trebizat River, on the water quality in Modro Oko Lake and Prud Spring, which are used for water supply and are located downstream of the Vrgorska Matica River on the right bank of the Neretva River. The water quality was evaluated by using the quality index based on the following nine parameters: temperature, mineralization, corrosion coefficient, K =(Cl + SO4)/HCO3, dissolved oxygen, BOD5, total N, protein N, total phosphorus and total coliform bacteria (100 mL)(-1) (MPN coli (100 mL)(-1)) for which concentrations C-95 are calculated. After completing the nine parameters the results of C-95 were recorded and transferred to the score table to obtain the q-value. The q-value used is an attempt to quantify environmental factors which would otherwise be qualitative. For each parameter the q-value was multiplied by a weighting factor based upon the relative significance of the parameter. The nine resulting scores values were then added to arrive at an overall water quality index (SigmaS(95)). According to this index the water can be classified into four categories. The first category, according to the Croatian Water Classification Act (Official Bulletin No. 77,1998), includes ground and surface waters used for drinking or in the food industry either in its natural state or after disinfection, and surface water used for raising high-quality species of fish, ranging from 85-100 scores; the second category includes water used in its natural state for swimming and recreation, sports or for other species of fish and the treated water used for drinking and other industrial purposes ranging between 70-85 scores. The third category includes water used in industry with no specific requests upon water quality and in agriculture ranging from 50-70 scores; the fourth category includes water used only after being treated in areas with water shortage which is less than 50 scores. According to results obtained by investigations, the water of the Vrgorska Matica River and Prud Spring falls into the second (II) category, while water from the Modro Oko Lake belongs to the first (I) category. This means that the Matica River water does not influence the water quality of the Modro Oko Lake. This lake water quality is influenced by the Rastocka Matica River from the Rastocko polje which is located upstream from the Vrgorska Matica River. This has been proved by dyeing tests.																			0167-6369					APR	2003	83	3					229	253		10.1023/A:1022600918066	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1022600918066								12718511					WOS:000181374100002

Stable water isotope patterns in a climate change hotspot: the isotope hydrology framework of Corsica (western Mediterranean)	ISOTOPES IN ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH STUDIES												The Mediterranean is regarded as a region of intense climate change. To better understand future climate change, this area has been the target of several palaeoclimate studies which also studied stable isotope proxies that are directly linked to the stable isotope composition of water, such as tree rings, tooth enamel or speleothems. For such work, it is also essential to establish an isotope hydrology framework of the region of interest. Surface waters from streams and lakes as well as groundwater from springs on the island of Corsica were sampled between 2003 and 2009 for their oxygen and hydrogen isotope compositions. Isotope values from lake waters were enriched in heavier isotopes and define a local evaporation line (LEL). On the other hand, stream and spring waters reflect the isotope composition of local precipitation in the catchment. The intersection of the LEL and the linear fit of the spring and stream waters reflect the mean isotope composition of the annual precipitation (delta(P)) with values of-8.6(+/- 0.2)parts per thousand for delta O-18 and-58(+/- 2)parts per thousand for delta H-2. This value is also a good indicator of the average isotope composition of the local groundwater in the island. Surface water samples reflect the altitude isotope effect with a value of-0.17(+/- 0.02)parts per thousand per 100m elevation for oxygen isotopes. At Vizzavona Pass in central Corsica, water samples from two catchments within a lateral distance of only a few hundred metres showed unexpected but systematic differences in their stable isotope composition. At this specific location, the direction of exposure seems to be an important factor. The differences were likely caused by isotopic enrichment during recharge in warm weather conditions in south-exposed valley flanks compared to the opposite, north-exposed valley flanks.					; A.C.

J	DePhilip, MM; Diana, JS; Smith, D				DePhilip, MM; Diana, JS; Smith, D			Movement of walleye in an impounded reach of the Au Sable River, Michigan, USA	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												We estimated long-range spawning and foraging movements of walleye and observed their use of river and reservoir habitats between two large hydroelectric dams on the Au Sable River, Michigan. We used radiotelemetry to monitor seasonal and daily movements of 11 large walleye. Walleye ranged throughout the entire reach between the two dams. Eight of the 11 fish used both river and reservoir locations. Walleye migrated upriver in April or May and presumably spawned near the dam tailwaters. After spawning, walleye remained in the river for up to 6 months, usually establishing local ranges. During this time, they occupied low-velocity refuges within the first 25 km of the upstream dam. They seldom occupied the downstream area, which has higher variation around the mean temperature. Food availability and water temperature may have affected the length of time that walleye remained in the river after spawning. All walleye overwintered in the reservoir. We designed this study to evaluate if walleye have a potential negative impact on brown trout, Salmo trutta. In summer, walleye were often present near sites where fingerling trout were stocked. We found the highest potential for interaction between the two species occurs within the first 25 km of the upstream dam during summer. The movement patterns of and habitats used by large walleye validate concerns that walleye could compete with adult brown trout for food and resting sites and prey on juvenile brown trout.																			0378-1909					APR	2005	72	4					455	463		10.1007/s10641-004-2864-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-004-2864-y													WOS:000228878000010

IMPLICATIONS OF CUTTHROAT TROUT DECLINES FOR BREEDING OSPREYS AND BALD EAGLES AT YELLOWSTONE LAKE	JOURNAL OF RAPTOR RESEARCH												In Yellowstone National Park (YNP), Ospreys (Pandion haliaetus) feed primarily on cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki bouvieri) and cutthroat trout represent approximately 23% of prey consumed by Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) during the breeding season (Swenson 1978, Journal of Wildlife Management 42:87-90; Swenson et al. 1986, Wildlife Monographs 95:3-46). The introduction of exotic lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) to Yellowstone Lake during the late 1980s caused substantial declines in populations of cutthroat trout. Historically, more than half of all breeding pairs of Ospreys and Bald Eagles in YNP have nested near and foraged at Yellowstone Lake and the decline in cutthroat trout numbers may affect rates of reproduction for these two species. We studied the relationship between an index of cutthroat trout abundance and spring weather on Osprey (1987-2009) and Bald Eagle (1987-2007) reproduction. We documented steep declines in an index of cutthroat trout abundance, Osprey productivity and nesting success, and a dramatic decline in the number of Osprey breeding pairs. Bald Eagle productivity and nesting success also declined, but at a slightly slower rate than that of Ospreys, and the number of breeding pairs of Bald Eagles increased over the study period. Osprey reproduction was positively correlated with an index of cutthroat trout abundance and spring temperatures. However, the relationship between Bald Eagle reproduction and the index of cutthroat trout abundance was unclear. Our study suggested that the recovery of cutthroat trout is important to maintaining a breeding population of Ospreys at Yellowstone Lake, but may be less important for the Yellowstone Lake Bald Eagle population.																			0892-1016					SEP	2013	47	3					234	245																WOS:000324507200002

Raccoon populations are rising both in range and density, which increases predation pressure. The raccoon is a food opportunist and its impact on local animal populations depends on the availability of food, especially during the critical winter period. In the winter of 2020-2021, we observed an extreme accumulation of empty shells of native mussels (Bivalvia, Unionidae) foraged by raccoons in the Lubuskie Lakeland in western Poland. The aim of this study was to determine whether mussels could be an important food source for raccoons during the difficult winter period in areas where they have been introduced. We hypothesised that raccoons would prefer thin-shelled mussels over thick-shelled species as their food. We identified the mussel species and estimated their numbers in the piles of shells found on the small river banks. The raccoons' prey consisted of 2,340 mussels belonging to three genera (Anodonta, Pseudanodonta, Unio) and five species complanata). Two of them, the Anodonta cygnea and Pseudanodonta complanata, have the status of endangered species in Poland and are red listed by IUCN respectively as Vulnerable (VU) in Europe and Endangered (EN) globally.

Key climatic features remain unknown, including the magnitude of warming during the Younger Dryas-Holocene transition along with the seasonality and spatial variability of Younger Dryas climate changes across Greenland. Here, we use geochemical and paleoecological proxies from lake sediments at Lake N14 in south Greenland to address these outstanding questions. Radiocarbon dating and diatom assemblages confirm early deglaciation and isolation of Lake N14 before similar to 13,600 cal yr BP, consistent with previous work. Oxygen isotope ratios (delta O-18) of chironomid head capsules, bulk aquatic moss, and aquatic moss-derived cellulose are used to reconstruct oxygen isotopes of past lake water and annual precipitation. Oxygen isotope proxies indicate annual precipitation delta O-18 values increased by 5.9-7.7% at the end of the Younger Dryas. Following the Younger Dryas, moss and cellulose delta O-18 values show a clear decline in precipitation delta O-18 values of 2-3% from similar to 11,540 -11,340 cal yr BP that may correspond with the Preboreal Oscillation. Reconstructed precipitation delta O-18 values then gradually increased from 11,300-10,100 cal yr BP. All three aquatic organic materials register similar shifts in precipitation delta O-18 values over time, and they closely parallel the delta O-18 shifts observed in ice cores. This evidence strongly supports the utility of these methods for reconstructing lake water delta O-18, and furthermore precipitation delta O-18 values where lake water reflects precipitation. The relatively large shift in isotopic composition of precipitation at Lake N14 suggests that shifts in temperature, precipitation seasonality, and/or moisture sources at the end of the Younger Dryas were even larger in south Greenland than they were in central Greenland, most likely because of the proximity to major changes in North Atlantic Ocean circulation. The annual air temperature change estimated at Lake N14 at the end of the Younger Dryas is also very large (similar to 18 +/- 7 degrees C) compared to the summer warming previously inferred from chironomid species assemblages there (similar to 6 degrees C). This indicates that the strongest warming at the end of the Younger Dryas occurred in the winter season, consistent with past observations of intensified Younger Dryas seasonality at Lake N14 and elsewhere in Greenland.

J	Anderson, NJ; Odgaard, BV; Segerstrom, U; Renberg, I				Anderson, NJ; Odgaard, BV; Segerstrom, U; Renberg, I			Climate-lake interactions recorded in varved sediments from a Swedish boreal forest lake	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												A 1100-year long record of lake ecosystem response to climate and catchment change with precise chronological control is reported. Diatom and pollen assemblages of an annually laminated (varved) sediment from a northern Swedish lake (Kassjon, Vasterbotten) were used as records of lake diatom communities and catchment vegetation. These data were compared with summer temperature estimates based on tree-ring records of the same geographical area to identify the effects of climate change and catchment disturbance on diatom assemblages in the lake. In a canonical ordination, 23% of the variability in the total diatom assemblages for the period AD1040-1804 was accounted for by changes in pollen data which reflect agricultural development in the catchment. Diatom species richness, however, exhibited a stronger relationship with summer temperature and, significantly, declined with the lower temperatures associated with the Little Ice Age minimum (early 17th century). Summer temperature accounted for 23% of the variability in diatom species richness 20 years later. The mechanism behind this time-lag is unclear, but may be related to catchment-mediated effects, given recent evidence for lags in the response of boreal-forest vegetation regeneration cycles to climatic variability. These results suggest that climate-related effects on lakes occurring over medium timescales can be resolved in lake sediments. Moreover, it is possible to identify these effects despite cultural-related signals, but as the latter become more extreme in the late 20th century the climate signal is obscured.

Pakistan has banned the use of organochlorine and nitrogen containing pesticides, yet no attention has been paid to the continuous monitoring and assessment of these banned pesticides to make sure that they are not being used in practice. Levels of selected organochlorine and nitrogen containing pesticide residues were assessed in water collected from 18 sampling sites on the River Ravi and its tributaries using a gas chromatograph equipped with an electron capture detector (GC-ECD). All water samples were found to be contaminated with varying concentrations of pesticide residues. However, levels of pesticides were below the tolerance limits suggested in national and international standards. Pesticide concentrations in the water of river sites ranged from 0.034 to 0.045 mu g/L for DDT, 0.033 to 0.046 mu g/L for DDE, 0.108 to 0.123 mu g/L for endosulfan and 0.028 to 0.040 mu g/L for carbofuran. In tributaries, pesticide concentrations ranged from 0.0468 to 0.0685 mu g/L for DDT, 0.0390 to 0.0637 mu g/L for DDE, 0.111 to 0.147 mu g/L for endosulfan and 0.0396 to 0.0631 mu g/L for carbofuran. The results show pesticide concentrations in river water in the order: endosulfan > DDE > DDT > carbofuran. Pesticide concentrations in tributary waters decreased in the order: endosulfan > DDT> DDE > carbofuran. After Degh Fall and After Hudiara Nulla Fall river sampling sites were severely contaminated while, among the tributaries, Degh Fall and Hudiara Drain were severely contaminated with DDT, DDE, endosulfan and carbofuran. Constant monitoring programs should to be initiated to reform the present situation.

White bass population demographics in a northwestern South Dakota reservoir	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												The white bass (Morone chrysops) is an important sport fish species in the upper Midwest. As such, understanding white bass dynamics is critical for managing its populations. Thus, we evaluated population dynamics of white bass in a northwestern South Dakota reservoir and attempted to determine whether bass recruitment patterns were more related to reservoir inflows or spring weather patterns. We found that white bass growth increased from 243 mm for age-2 fish, to 322 mm for age-6 fish, and then to 346 mm at age 9. The total annual mortality rate was 29.7%. In terms of year-class strength, white bass recruitment was erratic. The recruitment pattern was more related to spring weather patterns than reservoir inflow. In comparison, white bass population dynamics in this South Dakota irrigation reservoir were more similar to those of white bass populations in Midwestern glacial lakes than those found in southern US reservoirs.

Evidence of Countergradient Variation in Growth of Spotted Gars from Core and Peripheral Populations	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Peripheral populations occupy the edge of a species' range and may exhibit adaptations to potentially "harsher" marginal environments compared with core populations. The peripheral population of Spotted Gar Lepisosteus oculatus in the Great Lakes basin represents the northern edge of the species' range and is completely disjunct from the core Mississippi River basin population. Age-0 Spotted Gars from the peripheral population experience a growing season approximately half that of the core population but reach similar sizes by winter, suggesting potential for countergradient variation in growth, i.e. an evolutionary response to an environmental gradient such as latitude to compensate for the usual phenotypic effect of that gradient. In this study we used two common garden experiments to investigate potential countergradient variation in growth of young-of-year Spotted Gars from peripheral populations in comparison with those from core populations. Our first experiment showed that in a common environment under temperatures within the first growing season (22-24 degrees C), Spotted Gars from the peripheral population had significantly higher growth rates than those from the core population. Final Spotted Gar weight-length ratio was also higher in the peripheral versus core population. In our second experiment, under three temperature treatments (16, 23, and 30 degrees C), maximum growth occurred at the highest temperature, whereas growth ceased at the lowest temperature for both populations. These results suggest that important genetic and physiological differences could exist between the two population groups, consistent with countergradient variation. Our findings indicate that countergradient growth variation can occur even in relatively slowly evolving fishes, such as gars (family Lepisosteidae), and that protection of peripheral populations should be a key component of fish conservation planning.

J	Sweeney, BA; Cook, JE				Sweeney, BA; Cook, JE			A landscape-level assessment of understory diversity in upland forests of North-Central Wisconsin, USA	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												The study measured landscape level diversity of the understory plants of mature, upland forests in north-central Wisconsin USA. Habitat types were used to segregate the landscape along a moisture-nutrient gradient. Forty sites that had closed canopies, had been undisturbed for at least 20 years, and were at least 8 ha in size were used. The percent cover of groundlayer species was ocularly estimated in 12-18 randomly located, one meter square plots in June and August, 1995. Shrub cover was estimated by the line intercept method. Alpha, beta and gamma diversity were determined for early and late summer periods separately. Gamma diversity was quantified using a new method, affinity analysis, which generates a list of modal and outlier sites and calculates mosaic diversity, a measure of landscape complexity. Generally, communities in the middle of the moisture-nutrient gradient were modal, whereas those at the mesic end of the gradient were outlier. Mosaic diversity values were very similar for early summer and late summer (2.88 +/-0.04, 2.95 +/-0.03, respectively), but was much higher for both periods combined (3.95 +/-0.07). Whittaker's Index (beta diversity) revealed varying rates of species turnover along presumed moisture and nutrient gradients, whereas species densities and richness were relatively constant among habitat types. A one-way analysis of variance of Shannon-Weaver values found no significant differences among habitat types (p greater than or equal to0.05). Regional diversity mainly resulted from high beta values which appears to be primarily a function of the moisture gradient. The other factors influencing compositional differences among sites are variation in site history, especially disturbance, with niche partitioning and differences in seed dispersal capacity having a minor influence. The affinity analysis method indicated that sampling once per season is inadequate, and that many types of sites are modal. This method for estimating gamma (landscape) diversity shows considerable promise, but information on the processes that produce outlier sites is needed to fully understand and use the results of this method.																			0921-2973	1572-9761				JAN	2001	16	1					55	69		10.1023/A:1008157108667	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1008157108667													WOS:000167389900005
J	Winsemann, J; Brandes, C; Polom, U				Winsemann, Jutta; Brandes, Christian; Polom, Ulrich			Response of a proglacial delta to rapid high-amplitude lake-level change: an integration of outcrop data and high-resolution shear wave seismics	BASIN RESEARCH												In this paper, we will present the stratigraphic evolution, internal facies architecture and geomorphology of the Middle Pleistocene Emme delta, controlled by rapid high-amplitude lake-level change. The Emme delta was deposited on the northern margin of glacial Lake Weser, located in north-west Germany. Rates of lake-level rise were probably > 50 mm year-1 and rates of lake-level fall 30-50 m within a few days or weeks, due to the opening of lake outlets. We use digital elevation models, sedimentology and shear wave seismics to improve earlier reconstructions and investigate the influence of rapid base-level change on delta development. Shear wave seismic data resolve architectural elements in the range of metres and bridge the common gap between outcrop and conventional compression wave seismic data. The radial delta complex is about 2 km long, 1.8 km wide and up to 70 m thick, overlying a concave, up to 13 degrees steep dipping ramp surface. It consists of vertically and laterally stacked delta lobes, caused by lobe switching during base-level change. During the lake-level rise, vertically stacked (Gilbert-type) delta systems formed. The decrease in thickness and lateral extent indicates a rapid upslope shift of depocentres. A high rate and magnitude of lake-level fall (50 m) promoted the development of a single incised valley and the deposition of forced regressive coarse-grained delta lobes in front of the valley. The incised valley was filled during decreasing rates of lake-level fall and low base-level, because the alluvial gradient was larger than the emergent lake profile. Attached sand-rich forced regressive aprons formed during lower magnitudes of lake-level falls in the range of 30-35 m. Valley incision occurred, but was limited to the uppermost portion of the delta, controlled by the steep slope. The incised valley related to the final lake drainage is associated with long-wavelength (60-90 m) bedforms at the downslope end, attributed to the formation of standing waves as a result of a hydraulic jump. Estimated palaeoflow depth during standing wave formation was similar to 9-14 m and flow velocity was 10-12 m s-1. Because subsidence, waves or tides did not play a major role, the Emme delta can be used as an analogue-based predictive stratigraphical and sedimentological model for steep glacigenic deltas controlled by rapid base-level change and can help to understand better the facies distribution and three-dimensional geometry of these depositional systems.																			0950-091X	1365-2117				FEB	2011	23	1					22	52		10.1111/j.1365-2117.2010.00465.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2117.2010.00465.x													WOS:000286381500002

The catalytic subunit of the key enzyme for anaerobic arsenite oxidation is encoded by the arxA gene. In this study, a novel primer pair for the arxA gene was designed to detect diverse sequences of this notable gene. Further modification of the designed primer was made by adding extra bases to its 5'- end. This modification made it possible to analyze the PCR products with TA cloning, which provides higher throughput of investigations. With the combination of modified primer pair and TA cloning, diverse arxA gene sequences were effectively obtained from samples of lake water, spring water, and hot spring microbial mat. The sequences detected in the samples characterized by low salinity and nearly neutral pH were phylogenetically distinct from the majority of previously known arxA genes, found in the genome of alkaliphiles and halophiles.

For these experiments, we calculated the grazing rates from the digestion rate of C. triciliatum and its food vacuole contents. During the study period, M. aeruginosa exhibited one bloom event with a maximum density of 1.1 x 10(5) cells ml(-1). The cell density of C. triciliatum fluctuated from below the detection limit to 291 cells ml(-1). The number of M. aeruginosa cells ingested by C. triciliatum food vacuoles ranged between 0.4 and 10.8 cells flagellate(-1), and the digestion rate of C. triciliatum at 25 A degrees C was 0.73 % cell contents min(-1). The grazing rate of C. triciliatum on the M. aeruginosa prey was 0.2-6.9 cells flagellate(-1) h(-1), and its grazing impact was 0.0-25.3 % standing stock day(-1). The functional response of C. triciliatum to the M. aeruginosa prey followed the Michaelis-Menten model of significance (r (2) = 0.873, p < 0.001) in our experimental systems, in which the prey concentration varied from 1.0 x 10(4) to 2.1 x 10(6) cells ml(-1). The maximum grazing rate was 6.2 prey cells grazer(-1) h(-1), and the half-saturation constant was 1.2 x 10(5) cells ml(-1). We present evidence that C. triciliatum grazing explained the remarkable decrease in M. aeruginosa cell density in the pond. The present study is the first demonstration of the high potential of protistan grazing on M. aeruginosa to reduce cyanobacterial blooms.					; Nakano, Shin-ichi/M-5483-2016; Ohbayashi, Kako/V-8269-2019	Ohbayashi, Kako/0000-0002-4380-2690; 													1439-8621					JAN	2013	14	1					43	49		10.1007/s10201-012-0384-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-012-0384-6													WOS:000313359300006
J	Belant, JL; Van Stappen, JF				Belant, JL; Van Stappen, JF			Island biogeography of mammals in Apostle Islands National Lakeshore, USA	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												We examined the biogeographical distribution of nonvolant mammals among 20 islands in Apostle Islands National Lakeshore. Lake Superior, USA. Species-area relationships were calculated using the power function model (PF; S = cA(z)) with two different transformations (log S and log S + 1) and the cumulative extreme value function model (EVF) with logistic regression. Island area was positively associated with the number of species present on islands, With R-2 values of 0.78 (PF, log S), 0.82 (EVF), and 0.87 (PF, log S + 1). The EVF provided a better fit for extreme data values (species proportion [S-p] > 0.9). Degree of isolation did not appear to affect mammalian distribution among islands. However, isolation from the mainland was important in that fewer species that hibernated or were less active in winter colonized islands (P < 0.040). Larger islands Supported species with greater body mass (P < 0.001). We conclude that island area and degree of winter activity were dominant factors affecting distribution of nonvolant mammals at Apostle Islands National Lakeshore. Our data also Support the incidence function hypothesis in that some species require resources (e.g.. large home ranges) supported only by larger islands. For determining species-area relationships. We recommend use of EVF models over PF models, particular when data include islands with S-p = 0 or when S-p approaches 1. Because of low colonization potential and high extinction rates, development of conservation reserves for terrestrial vertebrates should incorporate species-area relationship data for nonvolant mammals.

Huge dredged sediments have been produced in every year. Hence, it faces a serious challenge to treat and utilize the sediments properly. The sediments dredged from Kunming Lake of Summer Palace in Beijing have been chosen to pyrolyze in a fixed bed reactor to find a clean and efficient way to treat the sludge. Clean combustible gases and kinetics for sludge pyrolysis have been made in this paper. It indicates that the production of combustible gases from the sludge during pyrolysis gives a similar way either at the addition of the catalysts or not. Long residence time and high temperature enhance gases production. Activation energy E of the reaction decreases in the addition of suitable catalysts.																					978-7-03-020403-5				2007							1406	1409																WOS:000252307300266

In addition, passive air sampler and knife-edge surrogate surface samplers were used to collect the ambient air mercury species concentrations and dry depositions, respectively, in this study. Moreover, direct mercury analyzer was directly used to detect the mercury Hg(p) and RGM concentrations. The result indicated that: (1) The average highest RGM, Hg(p), GEM and total mercury concentrations, and dry depositions were observed in January, prevailing dust storm occurred in winter season was the possible major reason responsible for the above findings. (2) The highest average RGM, Hg(p), GEM and total mercury concentrations, dry depositions and velocities were occurred in winter. This is because that China is the largest atmospheric mercury (Hg) emitter in the world. Its Hg emissions and environmental impacts need to be evaluated. (3) The results indicated that the total mercury ratios of Kaohsiung to that of this study were 5.61. This is because that Kaohsiung has the largest industry density (similar to 60 %) in Taiwan. (4) the USA showed average lower mercury species concentrations when compared to those of the other world countries. The average ratios of China/USA values were 89, 76 and 160 for total mercury, RGM and Hg(p), respectively, during the years of 2000-2012.																			0269-4042	1573-2983				AUG	2017	39	4					901	911		10.1007/s10653-016-9861-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10653-016-9861-x								27495251					WOS:000404605800015

Cellular RNA content (RNA/cell), determined by the real-time PCR method with a primer specific for amplification of Microcystis rRNA, was used as an index of in-situ growth rate. A Microcystis bloom was found in the canal in summer 2004 but not in summer 2003, because of its coldness. Corresponding to this, the average value of RNA/cell in 2004 was significantly higher than that in 2003. Water temperature, light intensity, and NO3 and PO4 concentrations were regarded as the factors limiting the in-situ growth rate of Microcystis in the canal, and their effects were quantified on the basis of laboratory experimental data. Effects of temperature and light intensity (photoinhibition by excessive photon flux density) were found to be important in limiting the growth rate, and more severe limitation was suggested in 2003. We then estimated the in-situ growth rate from the combined effect of these limiting factors. The estimated in-situ growth rates correlated significantly with RNA/cell in each year and in the combined (2003 + 2004) data. This agreement between our two different methods for estimation of in-situ growth rate suggests the validity of our approaches. This study was first field application of cellular RNA content as an index of algal growth rate in natural water samples.

Place of the lidar measurements and atmospheric conditions contributed to a relatively frequent occurrence of internal gravity waves (in the form of quasi-harmonic oscillations of the wind vector components) in the atmospheric boundary layer. As a result of our analysis of this experimental data we have detected 6 cases of propagation of the gravity wave with the oscillation period of 6.5 min and 18 min (once) and 9 min (four cases). As a rule, the duration of gravity wave observation was around 45 min, but in one case the duration was approximately 4 hours.

A compositional analysis approach to phytoplankton composition in coastal Mediterranean wetlands: Influence of salinity and nutrient availability	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Mediterranean wetland communities are strongly constrained by hydrological perturbations and the water flow regime. Salinity and nutrient availability have often been considered the most important variables determining changes in the phytoplankton community of coastal wetlands. Ratios between the main environmental variables often have more relevance than the absolute values of each variable; however, in most cases ratios are not suitable for use in multivariate models commonly used by limnologists. The main objective of the present work was to identify the main variables or variable ratios that are the driving forces of the major phytoplankton taxonomic groups in Mediterranean coastal wetlands, using compositional data analysis techniques (CoDa). With this aim, eleven shallow wetlands (6 in Emporda, 5 in Donana, NE and SW of Spain respectively) were sampled in winter and spring 2007. Two approaches were used: the first one using raw data and the second one using CoDa techniques to transform data. Our results show that differences in hydrological patterns led to three main community assemblages, ranging from communities dominated by typical marine taxa (diatoms and dinoflagellates) when the marine influence was high, to communities dominated by cyanobacteria during confinement and when inorganic nitrogen was scarce. In freshwaters with a high turnover rate, the community was dominated by opportunistic chlorophytes and cryptophytes that need inorganic nitrogen availability. When the raw data and CoDa approaches were compared, the CoDa approach permitted a better ecological interpretation of the phytoplankton community and the main ecological processes. Salinity was the main environmental determinant with both approaches, while the second CoDa RDA axis was related with the balance between the peptidase and phosphatase enzyme activities, confirming the relevance of nutrient retrieval processes in determining phytoplankton composition. We recommend the use of CoDa techniques for analyses of planktonic communities, such as the one presented here, in order to improve the interpretation of both existing and future datasets.

J	BROOKS, AS; EDGINGTON, DN				BROOKS, AS; EDGINGTON, DN			BIOGEOCHEMICAL CONTROL OF PHOSPHORUS CYCLING AND PRIMARY PRODUCTION IN LAKE-MICHIGAN	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												A 3-yr study in Lake Michigan has shown a 27 mmol P m-2 increase in the mass of total P (TP) in the water during spring when the lake is mixed from surface to sediment. This value is an order of magnitude greater than the annual P input from external sources. TP changed in concert with increases in chlorophyll a and organic N and decreases in nitrate and soluble Si. The concentration of soluble reactive PO43- (SRP) remained relatively constant throughout the study. We hypothesize that the SRP concentration is maintained by a chemical equilibrium with calcium-phosphate species. The increased mass of TP arises from the sequestering of P by algae which displaces the chemical equilibrium and allows more P to be released to the water from the sediments. Solar irradiance and the duration of mixing determine the magnitude of the spring bloom and the demand for P that must be supplied through the flux of P from the sediments to the overlying water.																			0024-3590					JUN	1994	39	4					961	968		10.4319/lo.1994.39.4.0961	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1994.39.4.0961													WOS:A1994PC98200018

Ice processes on medium-sized north-temperate lakes	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Lake ice supports a range of socio-economic and cultural activities including transportation and winter recreational actives. The influence of weather patterns on ice-cover dynamics of temperate lakes requires further understanding for determining how changes in ice composition will impact ice safety and the range of ecosystem services provided by seasonal ice cover. An investigation of lake ice formation and decay for three lakes in Central Ontario, Canada, took place over the course of two winters, 2015-2016 and 2016-2017, through the use of outdoor digital cameras, a Shallow Water Ice Profiler (upward-looking sonar), and weekly field measurements. Temperature fluctuations across 0 degrees C promoted substantial early season white ice growth, with lesser amounts of black ice forming later in the season. Ice thickening processes observed were mainly through meltwater, or midwinter rain, refreezing on the ice surface. Snow redistribution was limited, with frequent melt events limiting the duration of fresh snow on the ice, leading to a fairly uniform distribution of white ice across the lakes in 2015-2016 (standard deviations week to week ranging from 3 to 5 cm), but with slightly more variability in 2016-2017 when more snow accumulated over the season (5 to 11 cm). White ice dominated the end-of-season ice composition for both seasons representing more than 70% of the total ice thickness, which is a stark contrast to Arctic lake ice that is composed mainly of black ice. This research has provided the first detailed lake ice processes and conditions from medium-sized north-temperate lakes and provided important information on temperate region lake ice characteristics that will enhance the understanding of the response of temperate lake ice to climate and provide insight on potential changes to more northern ice regimes under continued climate warming.					; Brown, Laura/F-5932-2011	Ariano, Sarah/0000-0002-5760-6586; Brown, Laura/0000-0002-3173-8433; 													0885-6087	1099-1085				AUG 30	2019	33	18					2434	2448		10.1002/hyp.13481	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.13481													WOS:000478909200005

The plankton averaged 7.2 g dry weight.m(-2) with no seasonal pattern and respired 82 g O.m(-2).yr(-1). Gelatinous and chaetognath predators made up 10% of macrozooplankton biomass and respired 6.4% of planktonic respiration. The lipid content of the nongelatinous fraction fluctuated seasonaly from 64% of dry weight in midwinter to 46% in early summer. The benthic soft-bottom community inside Resolute Bay respired about 125 g O-2.m(-2).yr(-1), with a twofold rate increase in late summer. Offshore on hard bottom the few measurements we obtained suggested a respiration rate of about 75 g O-2.m(-2).yr(-1). The macrozooplankton and benthos were therefore approximately equal in energy flow. The total ecosystem respiration of 157 g O-2.m(-2).yr(-1) corroborated a previous independent estimate of photosynthesis of 60 g C.m(-2).yr(-1) for the region. Microplankton respiration appeared to be relatively low. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the proporion of primary production exported to the benthos increases with decreasing water temperature and depth, increasing latitude, and increasing cell size.																			0706-652X					MAY	1997	54	5					999	1005		10.1139/f97-006	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f97-006													WOS:A1997XF49600004

LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Beal MRW, O'Reilly BE, Soley CK, Hietpas KR, Block PJ. 2022. Variability of summer cyanobacteria abundance: can season-ahead forecasts improve beach management? Lake Reserv Manage. XX:XX-XX. As anthropogenic eutrophication and the associated increase of cyanobacteria continue to plague inland waterbodies, local officials are seeking novel methods to proactively manage water resources. Cyanobacteria are of particular concern to health officials due to their ability to produce dangerous hepatotoxins and neurotoxins, which can threaten waterbodies for recreational and drinking-water purposes. Presently, however, there is no cyanobacteria outlook that can provide advance warning of a potential threat at the seasonal time scale. In this study, a statistical model is developed utilizing local and global scale season-ahead hydroclimatic predictors to evaluate the potential for informative cyanobacteria biomass and associated beach closure forecasts across the June-August season for a eutrophic lake in Wisconsin (United States). This model is developed as part of a subseasonal to seasonal cyanobacteria forecasting system to optimize lake management across the peak cyanobacteria season. Model skill is significant in comparison to June-August cyanobacteria observations (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.62, Heidke skill score = 0.38). The modeling framework proposed here demonstrates encouraging prediction skill and offers the possibility of advanced beach management applications.

Here we present the results of pollen and grain size analyses of the interval similar to 36,400-13,400 cal yr BP and discuss the vegetation history, and record of climate change associated with the evolution of the Indian summer monsoon (ISM). Three stages of regional vegetation change are documented: (i) During the late Marine Isotope Stage 3 (36,400-29,200 cal yr BP), the study region was occupied by mixed coniferous and evergreen broad-leaved forest dominated by Pinus and evergreen Quercus, with Tsuga, Abies/Picea growing on the surrounding mountains. (ii) During the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 29,200-17,600 cal yr BP), cold-temperate coniferous forest dominated by species of Abies/Picea expanded and reached a maximum extent; and at the same time, the extent of evergreen broadleaved forest increased. (iii) From 17,600 to 13,400 cal yr BP the hemlock forest and Abies/Picea forest began to decline until they disappeared completely in the early phase of the Last Deglaciation, while pine forest and evergreen broadleaved forest dominated the surrounding areas. The vegetation history indicates a generally drying climate from 36,400 to 13,400 cal yr BP, suggesting a gradual weakening of the ISM with the weakest ISM influence occurring during the early part of the Last Deglaciation, when the climate was the driest. The regional temperature first decreased intermittently and then increased gradually, being mild and wet during the late MIS3 stage followed by the coldest but not the driest climate during the LGM when the temperature was at least 3 degrees C lower than at present.

Bacterial abundance and chlorophyll-a concentration dynamics showed a positive empirical relationship in sub-surface waters, but no relationships were found in deep waters. The estimation of bacterial size determined as biovolume, showed bigger cells in deep samples as a feature independent of phytoplankton production. This suggested that bacterial production was mainly linked to the growth of phytoplankton healthy cells in surface layers and with other processes as physical dynamics, nutrient supply from sediments and other allochtonous carbon sources in bottom samples.					; Guerrero Ruiz, Francisco Jose/E-7704-2012; Guerrero, Francisco/E-7704-2012; GOMEZ, FRANCISCO/E-7093-2012	Jimenez Gomez, Francisco/0000-0001-8644-7089; Rodriguez Martinez, Valeriano/0000-0003-1150-600X; Guerrero Ruiz, Francisco Jose/0000-0002-8983-3003; 													0007-9723						1996	37	3					221	225																WOS:A1996WF81500004

Macquarie perch fed on typical river-dwelling organisms from inflowing rivers, on terrestrial organisms that became displaced as the water-level rose, and on typical still-water or sluggish-water organisms, which were extremely abundant in the newly created lake. The relative proportions of several of these food types in the diet varied depending on whether the water-level was rising or falling. Macquarie perch appear to have adapted well to the changing food supply in the lake, and have included in their diet several food types that they would not normally have encountered in their natural riverine habitat.																			0067-1940						1986	37	5					647	657																WOS:A1986E585900008

Trends in summer chemistry linked to productivity in lakes recovering from acid deposition in the adirondack region of New York	ECOSYSTEMS												The US Environmental Protection Agency established the Adirondack Effects Assessment Program (AEAP) to evaluate and monitor the status of biological communities in lakes in the Adirondack region of New York that have been adversely affected by acid deposition. This program includes chemical analysis of 30 lakes, sampled two to three times each summer. Results of trends analysis for lake chemistry and chlorophyll a (chlor a) are presented for 1994 to 2003, and a general comparison is made with recent results of the Adirondack Long-Term Monitoring (ALTM) Program, which included chemical analysis of all but two of these lakes (plus an additional 24 lakes) monthly, year-round for 1992-2004. Increases in pH were found in 25 of the 30 AEAP lakes (P < 0.05) and increases in acid-neutralizing capacity (ANC) were found in 12 of the 30 lakes (P < 0.05). Concentrations of both SO42- and Mg2+ decreased in 11 lakes (P < 0.05), whereas concentrations of NO3- decreased in 20 lakes (P < 0.05). Concentrations of NH4+ decreased in 10 lakes at a significance level of P < 0.05 and in three other lakes based on P < 0.1. Concentrations of inorganic and organic monomeric aluminum generally were below the reporting limit of 1.5 mu mol L-1, but decreases were detected in four and five lakes, respectively (P < 0.1). Concentrations of chlor a increased in seven lakes at a significance level of P < 0.05 and two lakes at a significance level of P < 0.1. A significant inverse correlation was also found between chlor a and NO3- concentrations in nine lakes at a significance level of P < 0.05 and two lakes at a significance level of P < 0.1. Results of AEAP analysis of lake chemistry were similar to those of the ALTM Program, although decreases in SO42- concentrations were more evident in the year-round ALTM record. Overall, the results suggest (a) a degree of chemical recovery from acidification during the summer, (b) an increase in phytoplankton productivity, and (c) a decreasing trend in NO3- concentrations resulting from the increased productivity.																			1432-9840	1435-0629				DEC	2006	9	8					1306	1317		10.1007/s10021-006-0012-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-006-0012-6													WOS:000243652000008
J	Lemmen, J; Lacourse, T				Lemmen, J.; Lacourse, T.			Fossil chironomid assemblages and inferred summer temperatures for the past 14,000 years from a low-elevation lake in Pacific Canada	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Fossil midge remains in a sediment core from Lake Stowell, a low-elevation lake in coastal British Columbia, Canada, were used to assess temporal changes in chironomid communities and to produce quantitative estimates of mean July air temperature (MJAT) for the past 14,000 years based on two different transfer functions. Chironomid assemblages are diverse throughout much of the record, with most taxa present at low relative abundances. The basal portion of the sediment record is characterized by low head capsule concentrations, taxonomic diversity and organic matter content, all of which increase towards the early Holocene. Inferred temperatures suggest a cool late-glacial interval with a minimum MJAT of 12.5 A degrees C, similar to 2 A degrees C cooler than the inferred modern temperature. Summer temperatures gradually increased from this minimum until a brief cooling of as much as similar to 3 A degrees C relative to modern that coincides with the Younger Dryas chronozone. An interval of warmer summers with MJAT of similar to 16 to 18 A degrees C (2-3 A degrees C warmer than modern) is inferred between similar to 10,500 and 8000 cal year BP. This early Holocene warm period was followed by generally cooler inferred temperatures in the middle and late Holocene. The midge-inferred temperature record from Lake Stowell is generally consistent with other temperature reconstructions from the region based on chironomid remains and other climate proxies. This research underscores the potential of low-elevation, mid-latitude sites for chironomid-based temperature reconstructions. In order to maximize the availability of modern analogues for robust temperature reconstructions from similar sites, calibration datasets should be expanded to include more sites from the warm end of the temperature gradient.					; Lacourse, Terri/G-5647-2012	Lacourse, Terri/0000-0002-7559-5374; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				APR	2018	59	4					427	442		10.1007/s10933-017-9998-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-017-9998-3													WOS:000426572300003
J	Toft, G; Guillette, LJ Jr				Toft, G; Guillette, LJ Jr			Decreased sperm count and sexual behavior in mosquitofish exposed to water from a pesticide-contaminated lake	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												A number of reproductive abnormalities have been observed in wildlife living in Lake Apopka, Florida, USA. To test whether these abnormalities can be attributed to compounds in the water, we exposed male mosquitofish from Boulware Spring (Alachua County, Florida) to water from Lake Apopka and two reference sites, Orange Lake and Boulware Spring, for 1 month. Subsequently, sperm counts, sexual behavior, and sex hormones (testosterone and 17beta-estradiol) were measured. A lower sperm count and disrupted sexual behavior were found in fish exposed for 1 month to water from Lake Apopka, compared to those at the reference sites. Furthermore, sexual behavior and whole-body testosterone concentrations were correlated, suggesting androgen influences on the behaviors examined. We hypothesize that the presence of contaminants with antiandrogenic and estrogenic action in the water from Lake Apopka are the likely cause of the observed decrease in sperm count and impaired sexual behavior.

J	PACE, ML; PORTER, KG; FEIG, YS				PACE, ML; PORTER, KG; FEIG, YS			SPECIES-SPECIFIC AND AGE-SPECIFIC DIFFERENCES IN BACTERIAL RESOURCE UTILIZATION BY 2 CO-OCCURRING CLADOCERANS	ECOLOGY												The trophic interaction between zooplankton and bacteria was examined to determine how this food web linkage varied with resource abundance and consumer speciesd and age. Life table experiments and feeding-rate measurements were conducted with 2 spp. of co-occurring cladocerans. Daphnia parvula and Ceriodaphnia lacustris. Cohorts of these cladocerans were followed from birth to death and fed either no food (particle-free lake water), natural bacteria only (1-.mu.m filtrate of lake water), whole lake water or lake water enriched with 104 cells/ml of the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardi. By comparing cohorts grown in lake water to those grown in enriched lake water, the extent of food limitation in the natural populations of these 2 potentially competitive species was determined. As bacterial densities increased from winter through summer, the ability of the larger species, D. parvula, to grow and reproduce on the bacterial fraction also increased. Bacteria were never a primary resource for Daphnia. The rate of population increase (r) was always negative even at the highest in situ concentrations of bacteria (1-2 .times. 107 cells/ml). The smaller species, C. lacustris, was able to increase (r = 0.070) on bacteria alone at lower bacterial concentrations (5 .times. 106 cells/ml). Ceriodaphnia juveniles had the highest age-specific survival rates (lx) on bacteria. The improved survivorship was not due to higher feeding rates on bacteria by Ceriodaphnia. Neither age nor species when adjusted for the effect of body mass accounted for a significant portion of the variance in filtering rates on bacteria. Natural field food concentrations were always suboptimal, based on comparisons of growth rates, reproduction and r values for the cohorts grown in lake water vs. enriched lake water. Rates of increase (r) were always substantially greater than zero in the lake water treatment for both species, indicating that food is not the primary factor that causes seasonal declines of the cladoceran populations in this lake. A differential utilization efficiency of the smallest resource size-classes by these 2 zooplankton species was demonstrated. The dynamic nature of the trophic interaction between zooplankton and bacteria was indicated. The strength of this food web pathway varies with both the seasonal abundance of bacteria and the age, size and type of zooplankton consumer.

Tourism is one activity that is strongly impacted by these changes. Most research on tourism in mountain regions has focused on winter sports tourism, but glacier tourism, a summer activity, is also severely affected by climate change-induced phenomena, including glacier retreat and other geomorphological processes. Given that Alpine glacier tourism has been pursued since the 18(th) century and glaciers have been changing throughout this period, this article aims to examine the adaptations implemented by glacier tourism operators since the activity's beginnings. Through analysis of historical documents, glaciological surveys and semi-structured interviews, this paper reveals how tourism activities around the Mer de Glace (the largest French glacier) have been impacted by glacier fluctuations since the first visit to the area in 1741. The study reveals that these developments have mainly been driven by glacier retreat and associated paraglacial dynamics. More recently, the shortening of the period of snow cover on the glacier has also impacted tourism activities. Most of the adaptation strategies implemented by tourism operators during the period in question are found to be reactive, consisting in the installation of safety equipment, the renovation of access points or the building of new structures to allow tourist activities to continue despite the consequences of glacier retreat. Other strategies, such as the adoption of new activities by workers previously specialised in another, are identified that could be considered transformative strategies, although these were only adopted by workers when their activity was no longer feasible. The analysis of materials from 1741 to the present also reveals that the recent impacts of climate change on glacier tourism are much more significant and diverse than those produced by past fluctuations. Therefore, it is important that stakeholders take suitable measures to ensure the sustainable future of the Mer de Glace and other glacier tourism destinations.

A key outcome of SPICE was the development of transfer functions for the wind bias adjustment of solid precipitation measurements using various precipitation gauge and wind shield configurations. Due to the short intercomparison period, the data set was not sufficiently large to develop and evaluate transfer functions using independent precipitation measurements, although on average the adjustments were effective at reducing the bias in unshielded gauges from - 33.4 % to 1.1 %. The present analysis uses data collected at eight SPICE sites over the 2015/2016 and 2016/2017 winter periods, comparing 30 min adjusted and unadjusted measurements from Geonor T-200B3 and OTT Pluvio(2) precipitation gauges in different shield configurations to the WMO Double Fence Automated Reference (DFAR) for the evaluation of the transfer function. Performance is assessed in terms of relative total catch (RTC), root mean square error (RMSE), Pearson correlation (r), and percentage of events (PEs) within 0.1 mm of the DFAR. Metrics are reported for combined precipitation types and for snow only. The evaluation shows that the performance varies substantially by site. Adjusted RTC varies from 54 % to 123 %, RMSE from 0.07 to 0.38 mm, r from 0.28 to 0.94, and PEs from 37 % to 84 %, depending on precipitation phase, site, and gauge configuration (gauge and wind screen type). Generally, windier sites, such as Haukeliseter (Norway) and Bratt's Lake (Canada), exhibit a net under-adjustment (RTC of 54 % to 83 %), while the less windy sites, such as Sodankyla (Finland) and Caribou Creek (Canada), exhibit a net over-adjustment (RTC of 102 % to 123 %). Although the application of transfer functions is necessary to mitigate wind bias in solid precipitation measurements, especially at windy sites and for unshielded gauges, the variability in the performance metrics among sites suggests that the functions be applied with caution.					; Kochendorfer, John/K-2680-2012	Smith, Craig D./0000-0002-6552-1486; Kochendorfer, John/0000-0001-8436-2460													1027-5606	1607-7938				AUG 20	2020	24	8					4025	4043		10.5194/hess-24-4025-2020	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-4025-2020													WOS:000563077200001

Geothermal potential and origin of natural thermal fluids in the northern Lake Abaya area, Main Ethiopian Rift, East Africa	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												In this study, the occurrence, chemical composition, origin and geothermal significance of thermal springs and fumaroles naturally discharging in the area located north of the Lake Abaya (western margin of the Main Ethiopian Rift, East Africa) are reviewed in relation with recent tectonics. All thermal springs showed a dominantly Na-HCO3 composition, consistent with observations dating from at least 1972, and most of them displayed a narrow range of delta D and delta O-18 isotopic compositions for water similar to regional meteoric origins. These observations suggest that water-rock interaction processes occur in all aquifers and dominate the contributions of water that actively circulate within thermal fluids, and also suggest a similar elevation of groundwater recharge throughout the study area. Most of the thermal springs are dominated by a CO2-rich gas phase and discharge along the active faults bordering the western edge of the Main Ethiopian Rift valley. The delta C-13 values of CO2 and the (3)Fle/He-4 isotopic ratios are consistent with the presence of mantle-derived fluids similar to what is observed in many other areas along the kinematically active African Rift, especially within Ethiopia. The application of geothermometric techniques in the liquid and the gas phases suggests the presence of a deep reservoir in which the fluids equilibrated at a maximum temperature of approximately 180 degrees C. Additionally, the presence of fumaroles at boiling temperatures and water/mud boiling pools in several places suggests that the geothermal reservoir is positioned at a relatively shallow depth and likely located in the western side of the study area. The analysis of data collected throughout time reveals that the waters of Lake Abaya have experienced an increase in salinity of 20% paralleled contemporaneously with a decrease in pH and delta O-18 and delta D of water in the last 40 years; these changes do not appear to be related to climate change-induced increases in temperature or evaporation at the global scale.

Growing spherulitic calcite grains in saline, hyperalkaline lakes: experimental evaluation of the effects of Mg-clays and organic acids	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												The origin of spherical-radial calcite bodies - spherulites - in sublacustrine, hyperalkaline and saline systems is unclear, and therefore their palaeoenvironmental significance as allochems is disputed. Here, we experimentally investigate two hypotheses concerning the origin of spherulites. The first is that spherulites precipitate from solutions super-saturated with respect to magnesium-silicate clays, such as stevensite. The second is that spherulite precipitation happens in the presence of dissolved, organic acid molecules. In both cases, experiments were performed under sterile conditions using large batches of a synthetic and cell-free solution replicating waters found in hyperalkaline, saline lakes (such as Mono Lake, California). Our experimental results show that a highly alkaline and highly saline solution supersaturated with respect to calcite (control solution) will precipitate euhedral to subhedral rhombic and trigonal bladed calcite crystals. The same solution supersaturated with respect to stevensite precipitates sheet-like stevensite crystals rather than a gel, and calcite precipitation is reduced by similar to 50% compared to the control solution, producing a mixture of patchy prismatic subhedral to euhedral, and minor needle-like, calcite crystals. Enhanced magnesium concentration in solution is the likely the cause of decreased volumes of calcite precipitation, as this raised equilibrium ion activity ratio in the solution. On the other hand, when alginic acid was present then the result was widespread development of micron-size calcium carbonate spherulite bodies. With further growth time, but falling supersaturation, these spherules fused into botryoidal-topped crusts made of micron-size fibro-radial calcite crystals. We conclude that the simplest tested mechanism to deposit significant spherical-radial calcite bodies is to begin with a strongly supersaturated solution that contains specific but environmentally-common organic acids. Furthermore, we found that this morphology is not a universal consequence of having organic acids dissolved in the solution, but rather spherulite development requires specific binding behaviour. Finally, we found that the location of calcite precipitation was altered from the air:water interface to the surface of the glassware when organic acids were present, implying that attached calcite precipitates reflect precipitation via metal-organic intermediaries, rather than direct forcing via gas exchange.

Understanding the salinisation process for groundwater in an area of south-eastern Australia, using hydrochemical and isotopic evidence	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Increases in groundwater salinity down gradient are a common occurrence in catchments throughout Australia, exacerbating the effects of dryland salinisation in discharge areas. Groundwater hydrochemical and isotopic data from the Willaura catchment in south-eastern Australia, which is affected by both primary (natural) and secondary (human-induced) salinity, allowed the factors that cause the down gradient trend in salinisation within this catchment to be determined. The overall salinity of the groundwater (0.8-70 mS/cm) is controlled by evapotranspiration, which concentrates cyclic salts in the unsaturated zone, greatly increasing the salinity of the soil-water to 3700-6400 mg/L Cl-. The progressive addition of this saline soil-water to fresher groundwaters recharged on the catchment margins causes a gradual increase in salinity down gradient. The groundwater stable isotope compositions show that most recharge occurs in winter and spring. Groundwater salinities increase around the saline lakes of the discharge zone, due to direct evaporation from shallow watertables and minor dissolution of halite (as indicated by Cl-/Br- ratios). Mineral-water interactions within the aquifers cause a slight overall reduction in salinity; conversion of kaolinite to smectite and illite, and cation exchange of Na+ for Ca2+ on smectites, cause Na+/Cl-, Mg2+/Cl-, K+/Cl-, Si/Cl- and HCO3-/Cl- ratios to progressively decline and pH to gradually increase down gradient. Oxidation of organic matter causes a strong decrease in the redox potential of the groundwaters down gradient. The groundwater ages increase from modem (containing tritium) on the catchment margins to similar to 8000 years (based on C-14 dating) at the end of the similar to 25 km flow path. The older groundwaters are isotopically heavier than the younger waters, probably due to recharge during a wetter climate in the early Holocene. The groundwater ages show clearly that the progressive addition of saline soil-water, causing groundwaters to become more saline down gradient, has occurred throughout the Holocene and may explain the occurrence of primary salinisation within many Australian catchments.

Ecology and management of northern pike in Wisconsin	HYDROBIOLOGIA					International Pike Symposium held at the 136th Annual Meeting of the American-Fisheries-Society	SEP   05, 2006	Lake Placid, NY	Amer Fisheries Soc				Northern pike (pike) Esox lucius Linnaeus are broadly distributed across Wisconsin and provide an important sport fishery for anglers. Historical management has included use of angling regulations, stocking, and protection of critical habitat areas. Pike management is often a lower priority in comparison to more intensively managed species such as muskellunge Esox masquinongy Mitchell and walleye Sander vitreous. Pike provide angling opportunities year around, with higher catch rates and live release during open water, and higher harvest rates during winter. While length of pike caught during the two seasons is generally similar, there is some evidence that larger fish are caught during winter months. Results from minimum length limit changes implemented in 1995 have been equivocal and warrant further monitoring using standardized protocol to better determine effects on populations. If natural recruitment is not limited, pike populations can reach high densities and stunting can result. Loss of nearshore habitat has continued at an increased rate as more lake homes are built and shorelines graded, and altered with riprap, sand blankets, or sea walls. If natural recruitment is lacking, fry or fingerling stocking sustains or rehabilitates populations. Most pike stocking occurs in the southeastern portion of the state where habitat loss has been extensive. Stocking in other areas is largely to re-establish populations following a chemical reclamation or from winterkill. Future management needs to establish sampling protocols to ensure comparable data on both a temporal and a spatial scale. Long-term monitoring with these methods is essential to help determine effects of various factors (e.g., regulations, habitat loss) on populations.																			0018-8158					APR	2008	601						111	123		10.1007/s10750-007-9258-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-007-9258-z													WOS:000253200500011

Predicting the vulnerability of reservoirs to poor water quality and cyanobacterial blooms	WATER RESEARCH												Cyanobacterial blooms in drinking water reservoirs present a major ecosystem functioning and human health issue. The ability to predict reservoir vulnerability to these blooms would provide information critical for decision making, hazard prevention and management. We developed a new, comparative index of vulnerability based on simple measures of reservoir and catchment characteristics, rather than water quality data, which were instead used to test the index's effectiveness. Testing was based on water quality data collected over a number of seasons and years from 15 drinking water reservoirs in subtropical, southeast Queensland. The index correlated significantly and strongly with algal cell densities, including potentially toxic cyanobacteria, as well as with the proportions of cyanobacteria in summer months. The index also performed better than each of the measures of reservoir and catchment characteristics alone, and as such, was able to encapsulate the physical characteristics of subtropical reservoirs, and their catchments, into an effective indicator of the vulnerability to summer blooms. This was further demonstrated by calculating the index for a new reservoir to be built within the study region. Under planned dimensions and land use, a comparatively high level of vulnerability was reached within a few years. However, the index score and the number of years taken to reach a similar level of vulnerability could be reduced simply by decreasing the percentage of grazing land cover via revegetation within the catchment. with climate change, continued river impoundment and the growing demand for potable water, our index has potential decision making benefits when planning future reservoirs to reduce their vulnerability to cyanobacterial blooms.

The Spring Phytoplankton in the Pelagic Zone of Lake Baikal During 2007-2011	GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES												An assessment is made of the current status of the phytoplankton in the pelagic zone of Lake Baikal for 2007-2011, as the continuation of previous long-term research. We investigated the species composition, population, biomass and spatial distribution of the phytoplankton in the pelagic zone of Baikal. Its quantitative indicators for 2007-2011 have been compared with data of long-term investigations (1964-1990). It is shown that the species composition of the phytoplankton remained stable at different periods. The values of population and biomass for 2007-2011 fitted in the range of long-term fluctuations (1964-1990), with the species assemblage characteristic for that period. As in the case with previous research, the main contribution to the biomass of the spring phytoplankton in the lake was made by the diatoms Aulacoseira baicalensis, Synedra acus subsp. radians, Aulacoseira islandica, and Stephanodiscus meyeri. Their maximum and minimum concentrations were observed in the southern and middle lake depressions, and in Northern Baikal, respectively. The study revealed a correlation of phytoplankton biomass with silicon concentration; no correlation with nitrates, phosphates and temperature was ascertained.

Two types of tufa are represented, informally defined as (1) an easily disaggregated, fine-grained mixture of calcite and quartz (friable tufa) in the southwest Tecopa Valley, and (2) hard, vuggy micrite, laminated carbonate, and carbonate-cemented sands and gravels (indurated tufa) along the eastern margin of Lake Tecopa, High delta O-18(VSMOW) (Vienna standard mean ocean water) water values, field relations, and the texture of friable tufa suggest rapid nucleation of calcite as subaqueous, fault-controlled groundwater discharge mixed with high-pa, hypersaline lake water. Variations between delta O-18(VSMOW) and delta C-13(PDB) (Peedee belemnite) values relative to other closed basin lakes such as the Great Salt Lake and Lake Lahontan suggest similarities in climatic and hydrologic settings. Indurated tufa, also fault controlled, formed mounds and associated feeder systems as well as stratabound carbonate-cemented ledges, Both deposits represent discharge of deeply circulated, high total dissolved solids, and high pCO(2) regional groundwater with kinetic enrichments of as much as several per mil for delta O-18(VSMOW) values. Field relations show that indurated tufa represents episodic discharge, and U-series ages imply that discharge was correlated with cold, wet climate episodes. In response to both the breaching of the Tecopa basin and a modern arid climate, most discharge has changed from fault-controlled locations near basin margins to topographic lows of the Amargosa River drainage at elevations 30-130 m lower, Because of episodic climate change, spring flows may have relocated from basin margin to basin center multiple times.

Randal			Sandy soils in the forests of northern Michigan (USA) as methane sinks: Impacts of tree species composition and winter snowpacks	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Upland forest soils are one the largest terrestrial methane (CH4) sinks. The strength of this CH4 sink, however, is sensitive to the influence of forest composition and other environmental factors on the activity of CH4 oxidizing bacteria and archaea (methanotrophs). Climate change projections for the Great Lakes region (USA) point to expansion of deciduous broadleaf species at the expense of conifers, as well as decreased winter snowpack thicknesses. To assess the sensitivity of the soil CH4 sink to forest composition, winter snowpack thicknesses, and soil frost, we conducted a 2-year snow removal experiment in sandy soils. The sites were dominated by either sugar maple (Acer saccharum) or red pine (Pinus resinosa) in northern Michigan, USA. We measured in-situ CH4 uptake using static chambers in plots where snowpacks were either left undisturbed or removed. Our results indicate that annual soil CH4 uptake is 25-30 % higher under sugar maple than under red pine, suggesting that predicted broadleaf forest expansion will increase the strength of the soil CH4 sink. Nonetheless, our estimates of annual CH4 budgets for these stands also indicate that this process may only contribute 2-3 % of the annual climate mitigation services in these forests. We observed no differences in rates of wintertime CH4 uptake between treatments, and no carry-forward effects of snow removal on rates of growing season CH4 uptake. Depth trends in soil CH4 concentration indicate that wintertime CH4 uptake in our control treatment was limited primarily by the rate of diffusion of atmospheric CH4 through the snowpack and into the soil, whereas it appears that CH4 uptake in our removal treatments was limited by soil freezing. This implies that the response of the soil CH4 sink in these forests to climate change will depend on the balance between snowpack thicknesses, as it impacts soil freezing.																			0378-1127	1872-7042				MAR 15	2025	580								122527	10.1016/j.foreco.2025.122527	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2025.122527		FEB 2025											WOS:001422664500001

Analyzing floating and bedfast lake ice regimes across Arctic Alaska using 25 years of space-borne SAR imagery	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Late-winter lake ice regimes are controlled by water depth relative to maximum ice thickness (MIT). When MIT exceeds maximum water depth, lakes freeze to the bottom with bedfast ice (BI) and when MIT is less than maximum water depth lakes have floating ice (El). Both airborne radar and space-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery (Ku-, X-, C-, and L-band) have been used previously to determine whether lakes have a BI or El regime in a given year, across a number of years, or across large regions. In this study, we use a combination of ERS-1/2, RADARSAT-2, Envisat, and Sentinel-1 SAR imagery for seven lake-rich regions in Arctic Alaska to analyze lake ice regime extents and dynamics over a 25-year period (1992-2016). Our interactive threshold classification method determines a unique statistic-based intensity threshold for each SAR scene, allowing for the comparison of classification results from C-band SAR data acquired with different polarizations and incidence angles. Additionally, our novel method accommodates declining signal strength in aging extended-mission satellite SAR instruments. Comparison of SAR ice regime classifications with extensive field measurements from six years yielded a 93% accuracy. Significant declines in BI regimes were only observed in the Fish Creek area with 3% of lakes exhibiting transitional ice regimes lakes that switch from BI to FI during this 25-year period. This analysis suggests that the potential conversion from BI to FI regimes is primarily a function of lake depth distributions in addition to regional differences in climate variability. Remote sensing of lake ice regimes with C-band SAR is a useful tool to monitor the associated thermal impacts on permafrost, since lake ice regimes can be used as a proxy for of sub-lake permafrost thaw, considered by the Global Climate Observing System as an Essential Climate Variable (ECV). Continued winter warming and variable snow conditions in the Arctic are expected and our long-term analysis provides a valuable baseline for predicting where potential future lake ice regimes shifts will be most pronounced.

The lake is situated in a Norway spruce forest and has a steep watershed between elevations of 1090 and 1378 m. The average water input and output from the ecosystem was 1372 mm and 1157 mm (37 L km(-2) s(-1)), respectively, and the water residence time averaged 306 days. Despite ecosystem recovery from acidification occurring since the late 1980s, the Plesne watershed was an average net source of 25 mmol SO(4)(2-) m(-2) yr(-1). Nitrogen saturation of the watershed caused low retention of the deposited inorganic N (< 44% on average) before 2004. Then, the watershed became a net source of 28-32 mmol m(-2) yr(-1) of inorganic N in the form of NO(3)(-) due to climatic effects (a dry summer in 2003 and a cold winter in 2004) and forest dieback caused by a bark beetle attack in 2004. Nitrogen transformations and SO(4)(2-) release were the dominant terrestrial sources of H(+) (72 and 49 mmol m(-2) yr(-1), respectively) and the watershed was a net source of 24 mmol H(+) m(-2) yr(-1). Ionic composition of surface inlets showed seasonal variations, with the most pronounced changes in NO(3)(-), ionic Al (Al(i)), and DOC concentrations, while the composition of subsurface inlets was more stable. The in-lake biogeochemical processes reduced on average 59% of the incoming H(+) (251 mmol H(+) m(-2) yr(-1) on a lake-area basis). NO(3)(-) assimilation and denitrification, photochemical and microbial decomposition of allochthonous organic acids, and SO(4)(2-) reduction in the sediments were the most important aquatic H(+) consuming processes (358, 121, and 59 mmol H(+) m(-2) yr(-1), respectively), while hydrolysis of Ali was the dominant in-lake H(+) generating process (233 mmol H(+) m(-2) yr(-1)). Photochemical liberation from organic complexes was an additional in-lake source of Ali. The net in-lake retention or removal of total phosphorus, total nitrogen, and silica were on average 50%, 27%, and 23%, respectively. The lake was a net source of NH(4)(+) due to a cease in nitrification (pH < 5) and from NH(4)(+) production by dissimilation exceeding its removal by assimilation.

Estimating migration timing and abundance in partial migratory systems by integrating continuous antenna detections with physical captures	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												Many populations migrate between two different habitats (e.g. wintering/foraging to breeding area, mainstem-tributary, river-lake, river-ocean, river-side channel) as part of their life history. Detection technologies, such as passive integrated transponder (PIT) antennas or sonic receivers, can be placed at boundaries between habitats (e.g. near the confluence of rivers) to detect migratory movements of marked animals. Often, these detection systems have high detection probabilities and detect many individuals but are limited in their ability to make inferences about abundance because only marked individuals can be detected. Here, we introduce a mark-recapture modelling approach that uses detections from a double-array PIT antenna system to imply movement directionality from arrays and estimate migration timing. Additionally, when combined with physical captures, the model can be used to estimate abundances for both migratory and non-migratory groups and help quantify partial migration. We first test our approach using simulation, and results indicate our approach displayed negligible bias for total abundance (less than +/- 1%) and slight biases for state-specific abundance estimates (+/- 1%-6%). We fit our model to array detections and physical captures of three native fishes (humpback chub [Gila cypha], flannelmouth sucker [Catostomus latipinnis] and bluehead sucker [Catostomus discobolus]) in the Little Colorado River (LCR) in Grand Canyon, AZ, a system that exhibits partial migration (i.e. includes residents and migrants). Abundance estimates from our model confirm that, for all three species, migratory individuals are much more numerous than residents. There was little difference in movement timing between 2021 (a year without preceding winter/spring floods) and 2022 (a year with a small flood occurring in early April). In both years, flannelmouth sucker arrived in mid-March whereas humpback chub and bluehead sucker arrivals occurred early- to mid-April. With humpback chub and flannelmouth sucker, movement timing was influenced by body size so that large individuals were more likely to arrive early compared to smaller individuals. With more years of data, this model framework could be used to evaluate ecological questions pertaining to flow cues and movement timing or intensity, relative trends in migrants versus residents and ecological drivers of skipped spawning. Partial migration is common across taxa and there are numerous technologies that can detect animals that are actively migrating between habitats. We introduce a modelling method to evaluate migration timing and estimate abundances of residents and migrants. We apply our model to three native fishes moving between rivers to spawn.image						Thomas, Joseph E/0000-0003-1222-7061; Kendall, William/0000-0003-0084-9891; Yackulic, Charles/0000-0001-9661-0724													0021-8790	1365-2656				JUL	2024	93	7					796	811		10.1111/1365-2656.14076	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.14076		APR 2024						38561901					WOS:001194572300001

However, the water allocated based on the climate forecasts issued at the beginning of the season needs to be revised using the updated climate forecasts throughout the season. In this study, reservoir inflow forecasts downscaled from monthly updated precipitation forecasts from ECHAM4.5 forced with "persisted" SSTs were used to improve both seasonal and intraseasonal water allocation during the October-February season for the Angat reservoir, a multipurpose system, in the Philippines. Monthly updated reservoir inflow forecasts are ingested into a reservoir simulation model to allocate water for multiple uses by ensuring a high probability of meeting the end-of-season target storage that is required to meet the summer (March-May) demand. The forecast-based allocation is combined with the observed inflows during the season to estimate storages, spill, and generated hydropower from the system. The performance of the reservoir is compared under three scenarios: forecasts issued at the beginning of the season, monthly updated forecasts during the season, and use of climatological values. Retrospective reservoir analysis shows that the operation of a reservoir by using monthly updated inflow forecasts reduces the spill considerably by increasing the allocation for hydropower during above-normal-inflow years. During below-normal-inflow years, monthly updated streamflow forecasts could be effectively used for ensuring enough water for the summer season by meeting the end-of-season target storage. These analyses suggest the importance of performing experimental reservoir analyses to understand the potential challenges and opportunities in improving seasonal and intraseasonal water allocation by using real-time climate forecasts.

A significant influence could only be established by analysing the changes recorded over short periods of time, or by contrasting meteorological conditions in years characterised by an early onset of phytoplankton development (1989, 1990, 1991, 1993 and 1994) with the conditions recorded in more typical years (1979 to 1988, and 1992). The first-mentioned "early" years had significantly higher algal biovolumes and chlorophyll concentrations in March and lower ones in May, suggesting an earlier onset and termination of vernal algal development. Irradiance during "early" years reached average values or less whereas air temperatures around March were significantly higher (+ 3.5 degrees C on average). The comparison of time-series enabled only limited insight into the synergistic effects of irradiance, air temperature and wind on plankton dynamics. These synergistic effects are further evaluated in subsequent studies using hydrodynamical models to compute water column stability and its dependence on various meteorological factors.																					0-7923-5055-3				1998	42						39	55																WOS:000076501300003

Antibodies were raised against type strains from the Australian Collection of Antarctic Microorganisms. During summer, all four serogroups were identified in the aerobic waters of lakes with total dissolved salts above 61 parts per thousand. Maximal abundances of Halomonas meridiana, H. subglaciescola and Flavobacterium gondwanense serogroups were observed at discrete depths within the water column in the two most hypersaline lakes at about midsummer, coincident with the time of maximum sunlight and the commencement of the summer thaw. At this time the Halomonas spp. serogroups comprised up to 40% of the total bacteria and the F. gondwanense serogroup up to 10% of the total bacteria. The F. salegens serogroup was in low numbers (>2% of total bacteria) in some aerobic waters. Up to 2% of the total bacterial populations in the lakes were autofluorescent or stained non-specifically. Dissolved organic carbon values were measured throughout the sampling period and correlated well with total bacterial numbers but not with changes in species composition. Change in species abundance, as indicated by immunofluorescence, was not reflected in the total bacterial count, indicating compositional change of the total bacterial population.																			0954-1020					SEP	1994	6	3					325	332		10.1017/S0954102094000490	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954102094000490													WOS:A1994PF57300005

Analysis of Variations in the Regime of Rivers and Lakes in the Upper Volga and Upper Zapadnaya Dvina Based on Archaeological-Geomorphological Data	WATER RESOURCES												The geomorphological and altitudinal positions of occupational layers corresponding to 1224 colonization epochs at 870 archaeological sites in river valleys and lake depressions in southwestern Tver province. A series of alternating low-water (low levels of seasonal peaks, many-year periods without inundation of floodplains) and high-water (high spring floods, regular inundation of floodplains) intervals of various hierarchical rank was identified. In low-water epoch, an increase was recorded in the share of settlements on low elevations, including river and lake floodplains now subject to inundation. The archaeological epochs 2-3 Ky in length were found to form the following series from high-water to low-water: Mesolithic (11.8-8.0 Ky ago)-Iron age (2.8-0.3)-Neolithic (8.0-5.0)-Bronze epoch (5.0-2.8). The first half of the Iron age (2.8-1.8 Ky ago) was extremely water-abundant, while its second half (middle ages) was dry (relative to the present time). A correlation between the hydrological and temperature regimes was identified: low-water epochs closely correlate with warm epochs, while high-water ones correlate with cold epochs. This can be associated with the specific features of the present-day type of water regime with dominating spring flood; this regime is supposed to have existed during the most part of the Holocene: the runoff and the levels of floods decline during warming epochs and increase during cooling epochs.

The commonly available prediction models are physically based numerical approach or data-driven approach. However, these models are sometimes restricted by the lack of an explicit representation function or by insufficient data. The present research aimed to develop forecasting models that provide early warning on cyanobacteria outbreaks, as well as understand the ecological thresholds and relationships that determine such events, by means of evolutionary computation. The Lake Taihu, which has been suffering from severe cyanobacteria blooms over the last decades due to eutrophication, was taken as study case. Two modelling approaches were used based on water quality data collected from 31 monitoring sites from 2008 to 2012. First, eight sampling sites representing spatially different environmental conditions across Lake Taihu were selected to develop 2-day ahead forecasting models. The resulting models well-matched the timing and magnitude of the observed cyanobacteria dynamics for all eight sites, which was reflected by coefficients of determination (r(2)) of 0.62 for eastern site 24 being least favourable to cyanobacteria growth and 0.83 for north-western site 6 being most favourable. The sensitivity analyses revealed inhibitory relationships with nitrate at water temperatures greater than 18 degrees C and excitatory relationships with phosphate at lower water temperatures for most sites, which suggested N-limitation of the lake existed locally in summer and autumn. Second, the aggregated data from all 31 sites were used to develop a generic 2-day ahead forecasting model. When compared with the observed cyanobacteria data of the eight selected sampling sites, the generic model achieved slightly lower coefficients of determination than the site-specific models, with the lowest r(2) value for site 24 (0.36) and the highest r(2) value for site 6 (0.77). The sensitivity analysis for the generic model revealed a much lower water temperature threshold of 13.01 degrees C, above which N-limitation for cyanobacteria growth was indicated.

Fish landings in Barcelos, in the Middle Negro River Region, Amazonas	ECOSYSTEMS AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT X	WIT Transactions on Ecology and the Environment				10th International Conference on Ecosystems and Sustainable Development (ECOSUD)	JUN 03-05, 2015	Valencia, SPAIN	Univ Politecnica Valencia, Wessex Inst, Int Journal Design & Nat & Ecosystems, WIT Transact Ecol & Environm, Int Journal Design & Nat & Ecodynam				The purpose of this study was to gather information about fish landings in Barcelos, in the Middle Rio Negro region. Data were collected from fishing boats at weekends and from stalls where fish were processed and sold during the week. The results showed that in the period from February 2012 to January 2013, 56.0 tons of fish were landed and that average landings were 3.6 +/- 2.2 tons/month and 1.1 +/- 0.7 tons/month for fishing boats and for small boats with outboard motors, respectively. Pacu (subfamily Myleinae), aracu (family Anastomidae) and tucunare (Cichla spp.) were the main species caught and accounted for approximately 50% of the landings. The Demeni River, Lake Anauali and Zamula streamlet were the most exploited fishing areas. Fishing boats exploited the lakes in the dry and flood seasons and the rivers in all seasons of the hydrological cycle, with a slight predominance in the falling-water season. Streamlets were also exploited by fishing boats in all the seasons apart from the flood season. Lakes were the preferred environment for small boats with outboard motors in the dry season. While rivers were exploited by these boats throughout the year, streamlets were exploited mainly in the rising-and falling-water seasons. There was a decrease in fishing effort in the flood season and an increase in the dry season. Average CPUE was 21.9 and 23.9 kg/fisherman/day for fishing boats and for small boats with outboard motors, respectively.

Regional consistency in Lateglacial chironomid-inferred temperatures from five sites in north-west England	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS					Annual Discussion Meeting of the Quaternary-Research-Association	JAN 08-10, 2008	ENGLAND	Quaternary Res Assoc				High resolution Lateglacial ice-core records from Greenland show both millennial and centennial-scale change and have been used as a benchmark for Lateglacial climatic stratigraphy throughout the North Atlantic region and beyond In this study we assess the local reflection in north-west Europe of climatic events recognised in ice cores and identify differences in the climate signature between Greenland. UK and sites in continental Europe. This study uses chironomid-inferred temperature analysis and loss-on-ignition data from five carbonate lakes in north-west England to determine the pattern of Lateglacial climatic change and demonstrates the reproducibility of chironomid-inferred temperature reconstructions both within a catchment and from sites within a small area. At both millennial and centennial scales, our results show statistical similarities between sites, giving a clear regional signal. Chironomid assemblages pick out the rapid shifts at the major event boundaries at all sites and indicate temperatures of between 12 and 13 degrees C for the region at the beginning of Greenland Interstadial 1, a rapid fall of around 4 degrees C into the Younger Dryas and a rise of around 5 degrees C in the Early Holocene At a finer scale, four centennial cooling events are identified within the interstadial, together with an oscillation in the Early Holocene which we tentatively identify as the pre-Boreal event. The records were analysed statistically using redundancy analysis and sequence-slotting techniques. Differences in the impact of individual climatic events, demonstrate that subtle changes in the chironomid-inferred temperatures reflect the local geographical setting and morphology of the lakes; with more marked impact registered in higher altitude and more wind-exposed sites. Whilst the overall pattern of Lateglacial climate can be recognised from Greenland to central Europe, Important regional differences, that can be attributed to marine influence and, perhaps, changes in atmospheric circulation, are beginning to emerge.

Social Fish-Tancing in Wisconsin: The Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Statewide License Sales and Fishing Effort in Northern Inland Lakes	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												The first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 was associated with an "anthropause" in many industries, initially reducing greenhouse gas emissions and other negative anthropogenic influences. However, outdoor recreation has exploded in popularity in response to closures of indoor recreation options, increased free time, and/or increased levels of stress. We tested for the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the sale of fishing licenses in Wisconsin and on vehicle counts that were observed at public lake access points in Vilas County, Wisconsin, in 2020. In the summer of 2020, fishing license sales in Wisconsin, USA, increased, particularly among first-time license purchasers for whom cumulative sales in 2020 increased by 71% and 35% compared with the previous 5-year average for Wisconsin residents and nonresidents, respectively. Changes in the vehicle counts at lake access points in the summer of 2020 varied considerably by lake. However, lakes with greater proportions of public shoreline experienced pandemic-associated increases in lake visitors. Our results suggest that the distribution of recreational fishing effort in Wisconsin changed during the pandemic, potentially placing additional harvest pressures on hot spot inland lakes.

We present an n-alkane and compound-specific carbon isotope record during the past 16.5 kyr BP from Lake Xijianhaizi in the Yin Mountain, on the northern margin of the East Asian summer monsoon region. In this cold region, where the vegetation is dominated by C3 plants, the long-chain n- alkanes (nC(29)-nC(33)) are predominantly derived from leaf wax lipids. The compound-specific carbon isotopic value of nC(31) is sensitive to regional effective moisture. The results show that a relatively high effective moisture during the Bolling-Allerod (14.5-12.9 kyr BP) and the Younger Dryas (12.9-11.5 kyr BP), and low effective precipitation in the Pre-Boreal (11.5-11.0 kyr BP) and the late of the early Holocene (9.5-8.0 kyr BP). Since the early Holocene, a slight decreasing trend of delta C-13(31) in Lake Xijianhaizi implies increasing effective moisture. It may support the latitudinal temperature gradient would cause an increase in net precipitation in mid-latitude as suggested previously. The hydroclimate changes in this Alpine lake since the last deglaciation is different to the climatic change in southern China. In addition to uncertainties in proxy interpretation and dating, the huge topographical difference in northern China and strong seasonality might be one of the reasons for significant spatial hydrological differences among different localities.

This study presents a newly developed coupled lake-ice-atmosphere (CLIAv1) modeling system for the Great Lakes by coupling the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Unified Weather Research and Forecasting (NU-WRF) regional climate model (RCM) with the three-dimensional (3D) Finite Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM) and investigates the impact of coupled dynamics on simulations of the Great Lakes' winter climate. By integrating 3D lake hydrodynamics, CLIAv1 demonstrates superior performance in reproducing observed lake surface temperatures (LSTs), ice cover distribution, and the vertical thermal structure of the Great Lakes compared to the NU-WRF model coupled with the default 1D Lake Ice Snow and Sediment Simulator (LISSS). CLIAv1 also enhances the simulation of over-lake atmospheric conditions, including air temperature, wind speed, and sensible and latent heat fluxes, underscoring the importance of resolving complex lake dynamics for reliable regional Earth system projections. More importantly, the key contribution of this study is the identification of critical physical processes that influence lake thermal structure and ice cover - processes that are missed by 1D lake models but effectively resolved by 3D lake models. Through process-oriented numerical experiments, we identify key 3D hydrodynamic processes - ice transport, heat advection, and shear production in turbulence - that explain the superiority of 3D lake models to 1D lake models, particularly in cold season performance and lake-atmosphere interactions. Critically, all three of these processes are dynamically linked to water currents - spatially and temporally evolving flow fields that are structurally absent in 1D models. This study aims to advance our understanding of the physical mechanisms that underlie the fundamental differences between 3D and 1D lake models in simulating key hydrodynamic processes during the winter season, and it offers generalized insights that are not constrained by specific model configurations.					; Peters-Lidard, Christa/E-1429-2012; Xue, Pengfei/P-4016-2014; Xue, Pengfei/P-4016-2014	Kayastha, Miraj B/0000-0002-9956-8362; Xue, Pengfei/0000-0002-5702-421X; 													1991-959X	1991-9603				JUL 16	2025	18	13					4293	4316		10.5194/gmd-18-4293-2025	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/gmd-18-4293-2025													WOS:001529192500001

Artificial circulation of a mine pit lake	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING												We describe the artificial circulation (destratification) of a pit lake at the Colomac mine site, 220 km north of Yellowknife, NWT, Canada. The pit lake, with a surface area of 17 ha and depth of 110 m, contained relatively saline water contaminated with the mining-related cyanide by-products, thiocyanate and ammonia. As a result of snow and ice melt, the pit lake was intermittently meromictic and cycling of contaminants through the oxygenated surface layer would have taken many years. To accelerate the oxidation process, the pit was artificially circulated using two air diffusers at a depth of 57 m. The pit lake was circulated during the open-water season, from 12 July 2006 for 57 days, and from 17 June 2007 for 89 days. After the first 12 h of operation of the circulation system, the top 37 m of the pit lake was mixed completely; after 34 h, the pit lake was mixed to the depth of the diffusers (57 m); and after approximately 6.5 days, the pit lake was mixed to the bottom. Upon complete mixing, the temperature and conductivity remained uniform during operation of the circulation system, and the concentration of oxygen in the deep water of the pit lake increased significantly. All thiocyanate was oxidized by the end of the first summer, producing ammonia that was depleted after the second summer of circulation.

Hara to high nitrogen loading differ between the summer high-growth season and the low-growth season?	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Loss of submersed macrophytes is a world-wide phenomenon occurring when shallow lakes become eutrophic due to excess nutrient loading. In addition to the well-known effect of phosphorus, nitrogen as a trigger of macrophyte decline has received increasing attention. The precise impact of high nitrogen concentrations is debated, and the role of different candidate factors may well change over the season. In this study, we conducted experiments with Vallisneria natans during the growing season (June-September) in 10 ponds subjected to substantial differences in nitrogen loading (five targeted total nitrogen concentrations: control, 2, 10, 20, and 100 mg L-1) and compared the results with those obtained in our earlier published study from the low-growth season (December-April). Like in the low-growth season, growth of V. natans in summer declined with increasing ammonium (NH4) concentrations and particularly with increasing phytoplankton chlorophyll a (Chla(Phyt)). Accordingly, we propose that shading by phytoplankton might be of key importance for macrophyte decline, affecting also periphyton growth as periphyton chlorophyll a (Chla(Peri)) decreased with increasing Chla(Phyt). Free amino acid contents (FAA) of plants tended to increase with increasing NH4 concentrations, while the relationships between FAA with growth indices were all weak, suggesting that FAA might be a useful indicator of the physiological stress of the plants but not of macrophyte growth. Taken together, the results from the two seasonsindicate that although a combination of high nitrogen concentrations ( ammonium) and shading by phytoplankton may cause severe stress on macrophytes, active growth in the growing season enabled them to partly overcome the stress.

A Theoretical Review about the Romanian Case	INFORMATION												The present article includes descriptive research about how water resources in Romanian medical spas could be better promoted to increase their visibility. Romania is one of the European countries with impressive potential in terms of balneology, having a wide diversity of natural factors that allow treating several medical conditions in the same resort. In addition, one-third of the mineral and thermal water springs in Europe are present on the Romanian territory, making Romania one of the most important European destinations in terms of natural spa resources. The present research aims to illustrate how the Romanian medical spas communicate with tourists about the therapeutic water available in five medical spas: BAile Felix-1 Mai, Techirghiol, BAile Ttinad, Sovata and Covasna, having as its main objective to raise the awareness among the spas representatives regarding the necessity of water management implementation. The research is based on primary data obtained from the official websites of the resorts included in the study and in the published scholarly articles that approached the Romanian medical spas.

This was the first mass development of Dunaliella observed in the lake since 1980, when another bloom was reported (up to 8800 cells ml(-1)). For a bloom of Dunaliella to develop in the Dead Sea, two conditions must be fulfilled: the salinity of the upper water layers must become sufficiently low as a result of dilution with rain floods, and phosphate must be available. During the period 1983-1991 the lake was holomictic, hardly any dilution with rainwater occurred, and no Dunaliella cells were observed. Heavy rain floods in the winter of 1991-1992 caused a new stratification, in which the upper 5 m of the water column became diluted to about 70% of their former salinity. Measurements of the isotopic composition of inorganic carbon in the upper water layer during the bloom (delta(13)C = 5.1 parts per thousand) indicate a strong fractionation when compared with the estimated -3.4 parts per thousand prior to the bloom. The particulate organic carbon formed was highly enriched in light carbon isotopes (delta(13) C = -13.5 parts per thousand). The algal bloom rapidly declined during the months June-July, probably as a result of the formation of resting stages, which sank to the bottom. A smaller secondary bloom (up to 1850 cells ml(-1)) developed between 6 and 10 m depth at the end of the summer. Salinity values at this deep chlorophyll maximum were much beyond those conductive for the growth of Dunaliella, and the factors responsible for the development of this bloom are still unclear.

Effects of tillage practices on phosphorus transport in tile drain effluent under sandy loam agricultural soils in Ontario, Canada	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Agricultural watersheds have been identified as a source of nutrients to surface water bodies, contributing to the degradation of water quality. Reduced till (RT) management practices have been employed to reduce the potential for particulate P loss in surface runoff, but may increase the transfer of dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) into tile drains. It is unclear if RT increases P losses in tile drainage when nutrient management strategies are used and fertilizers are applied in the subsurface. It is also unclear how these management strategies perform year round, including during the snowmelt period. The objectives of this study are to quantify year round losses of runoff, DRP and total phosphorus (TP) losses from drainage tiles beneath annual disk till (AT) and reduced till (RT) plots, and, to investigate the role of seasonality (particularly winter snowmelt) on runoff and P losses. Results indicate that both runoff and P-export were episodic across all plots and most annual losses occurred during a few key events under heavy precipitation or snowmelt events. Runoff and P losses through drainage tiles were primarily observed between October and May, with most losses occurring in March during snowmelt Tillage practices did not affect DRP or TP concentrations or loads in tile drainage. This study has highlighted the importance of the non-growing season (particularly winter) in annual P loss, and has demonstrated that the cumulative Best Management Practices (BMPs) used at the study sites may be an effective way to reduce P losses in tile drain effluent.

In this study, the diet of the Italian crested newt, Triturus carnifex, in the world's deepest karst phreatic sinkhole, the Pozzo del Merro in Latium, central Italy, was analyzed. We obtained both stomach and fecal contents from twenty adult newts (ten females and ten males) sampled in summer 2010. Availability of prey in the sinkhole also was determined. Prey items were identified and classified into ten ecological groups. At Pozzo del Merro, during the summer, the aquatic stage of T. carnifex was specialized on the pre-imaginal stages of the small China-mark, Cataclysta lemnata. The recently described endemic stygobitic crustacean Niphargus cornicolanus was not found in stomach contents.

Despite substantial research attention on lacustrine DO evolution, systematic investigations focusing on shallow eutrophic lakes remain lacking. This study employs monitoring datasets of water quality and meteorological parameters from a shallow eutrophic lacustrine system, to conduct multidimensional analysis of DO variation characteristics and driving mechanisms. Analytical results demonstrate a 0.034 mg center dot L-1 increase in DO concentration within the whole lake during the 2012-2021 period. Thermal variation in lake alone proves inadequate to fully elucidate this trend, particularly under lower thermal regimes. Spring and autumn water depth fluctuations significantly modulate DO levels, while reduced Secchi depth correlates with DO decline across multiple lake sectors. Under climate change scenarios, the enhanced oxygen depletion in lacustrine systems induced by prolonged sunshine duration cannot be counterbalanced by the concomitant stimulation of photosynthetic efficiency within the photic zone, while precipitation and wind speed demonstrate dual-phase effects. Critical thresholds occur at monthly precipitation exceeding 20 mm and sustained wind speeds surpassing 3 m center dot s(-1), where DO transitions from net gain to loss-changes potentially driven by water column mixing dynamics and algal metabolism. Among aquatic environmental, water temperature exerts predominant control over DO variability, with its positive effects under lower temperatures being particularly pronounced. Inversely, chlorophyll-a concentrations exceeding 20 mu g center dot L-1 are prerequisite for net DO increases, whereas subthreshold levels correlate with the decrease of oxygen. Within lacustrine nutrient dynamics, the regulatory influence of total phosphorus on DO is significantly weaker compared to that exerted by total nitrogen, but hypereutrophic total phosphorus concentrations (>0.4 mg center dot L-1) markedly enhance deoxygenation through nutrient-driven eutrophication cascades. Accordingly, targeted phosphorus control emerges as a critical strategy for mitigating hypoxic events in shallow eutrophic lakes.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				OCT	2025	179								114190	10.1016/j.ecolind.2025.114190	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2025.114190													WOS:001569309800002

Moreover, biological succession and the dynamics of zooplankton can differ in urban ponds where we may observe a specific combination of environmental factors (e.g., an increase of eutrophication and pollution) compared to other water ecosystems. Therefore, ten urban artificial ponds were examined and the type of direct catchment area was established as the most important factor in the determination of zooplankton distribution. Different environmental factors structured zooplankton distribution between forest and meadow ponds. Low concentrations of oxygen as well as lack of fish, which was an effect of high concentrations of ammonium nitrogen, were responsible for the occurrence of littoral species and large crustacean species (e.g., Daphnia hyalina and Megacyclops viridis) in the case of forest ponds. Fish predation on large crustaceans and favourable food conditions (high concentration of chlorophyll a) created suitable conditions for the occurrence of pelagic species (e.g., Keratella cochlearis and K. quadrata) in the case of meadow ponds. Moreover, soon after the ice cover melted and before new macrophytes developed, previous-year dry rush stems created valuable refuge conditions for zooplankton in this type of pond. Despite anthropogenic pollution resulting from the close vicinity of the agglomeration of Poznan and unfavourable conditions attributed to the spring season a diverse zooplankton community occurred, reaching the level of 119 species in total.					; Kuczyńska-Kippen, Natalia/AAC-1955-2022	Kuczynska-Kippen, Natalia/0000-0002-0513-9461; 													0003-4088	2100-000X					2014	50	4					315	323		10.1051/limn/2014025	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/2014025													WOS:000346605600006

We present here the second of a set of papers reporting the findings of fieldwork and laboratory analyses of one of the largest of these structures, Kone Caldera, located within the Kone Volcanic Complex in the northern Main Ethiopian Rift. The most recent major episode of explosive eruptive activity at Kone Caldera was apparently associated with formation of part of the overall 8-km-diameter collapse area, and deposited a widely-dispersed alkali rhyolite tephra that reaches a thickness of up to 60 m in vent-proximal deposits. We report here the physical characteristics of this unit in order to constrain eruptive conditions. The pumice fall deposit suggests that an abrupt decrease in magma discharge rate occurred part way through the eruption. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In this context, a 2-D automated electrical resistivity tomography (A-ERT) system was installed for the first time in Antarctica at Deception Island, associated to the existing Crater Lake site of the Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring - South Program (CALM-S) - site. This setup aims to (i) monitor subsurface freezing and thawing processes on a daily and seasonal basis and map the spatial and temporal variability in thaw depth and to (ii) study the impact of short-lived extreme meteorological events on active layer dynamics. In addition, the feasibility of installing and running autonomous ERT monitoring stations in remote and extreme environments such as Antarctica was evaluated for the first time. Measurements were repeated at 4 h intervals during a full year, enabling the detection of seasonal trends and short-lived resistivity changes reflecting individual meteorological events. The latter is important for distinguishing between (1) long-term climatic trends and (2) the impact of anomalous seasons on the ground thermal regime. Our full-year dataset shows large and fast temporal resistivity changes during the seasonal active layer freezing and thawing and indicates that our system setup can resolve spatiotemporal thaw depth variability along the experimental transect at very high temporal resolution. The largest resistivity changes took place during the freezing season in April, when low temperatures induce an abrupt phase change in the active layer in the absence of snow cover. The seasonal thawing of the active layer is associated with a slower resistivity decrease during October due to the presence of snow cover and the corresponding zero-curtain effect. Detailed investigation of the daily resistivity variations reveals several periods with rapid and sharp resistivity changes of the near-surface layers due to the brief surficial refreezing of the active layer in summer or brief thawing of the active layer during winter as a consequence of short-lived meteorological extreme events. These results emphasize the significance of the continuous A-ERT monitoring setup which enables detecting fast changes in the active layer during short-lived extreme meteorological events. Based on this first complete year-round A-ERT monitoring dataset on Deception Island, we believe that this system shows high potential for autonomous applications in remote and harsh polar environments such as Antarctica. The monitoring system can be used with larger electrode spacing to investigate greater depths, providing adequate monitoring at sites and depths where boreholes are very costly and the ecosystem is very sensitive to invasive techniques. Further applications may be the estimation of ice and water contents through petrophysical models or the calibration and validation of heat transfer models between the active layer and permafrost.					; De Pablo, Miguel/J-6442-2014; Vieira, Goncalo/G-5958-2010; de Pablo, Miguel Angel/J-6442-2014; Farzamian, Mohammad/K-9804-2015; Paz, Maria Catarina/I-3384-2018; Ramos, Miguel/K-2230-2014	Hauck, Christian/0000-0003-4488-6475; Vieira, Goncalo/0000-0001-7611-3464; de Pablo, Miguel Angel/0000-0002-4496-2741; Farzamian, Mohammad/0000-0001-9549-7344; Paz, Maria Catarina/0000-0001-8411-0896; Ramos, Miguel/0000-0003-3648-6818													1994-0416	1994-0424				MAR 25	2020	14	3					1105	1120		10.5194/tc-14-1105-2020	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-1105-2020													WOS:000522153000002

Co-Occurrence Patterns of Aquatic Macroinvertebrates in Laurentian Great Lakes Coastal Wetlands	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												In niche-based community assembly theory, it is presumed that communities in habitats with high natural disturbance regimes are less likely to be structured by competitive mechanisms. Laurentian Great Lakes (hereafter Great Lakes) coastal wetlands can experience drastic diel fluctuations in dissolved oxygen levels, severe wave action, ice scour, and near complete freezing during the winter such that conditions are inhospitable for most organisms. The high natural disturbance levels are thought to cause high interannual turnover for aquatic macroinvertebrate communities and support the hypothesis that these communities are less likely to experience less competitive interactions and negative co-occurrence structure. We hypothesize that non-random co-occurrence patterns will be rare in Great Lake coastal wetlands and non-competitive processes (e.g., through shared or differential microhabitat affinities, pollution tolerances, or biotic homogenization) will be more common than competitively driven negative co-occurrence patterns. Null model analysis was performed on 134 macroinvertebrate communities sampled from across the Great Lakes basin from 2000 to 2013. To disentangle the effects of alternative structuring mechanisms (i.e., shared/differential habitat affinities, shared/differential pollution tolerance, and biological homogenization/competitive exclusion), communities were parsed based on the year sampled, the vegetation type from which community samples were collected, and lastly species' functional feeding group assignment or taxonomic group. As expected, very few communities were non-randomly structured; however, all of those that were non-random exhibited showed more negative co-occurrences than by chance. Upon further investigation, these communities consisted of species that are known to overwinter in wetlands, and therefore, avoid having to recolonize after each spring thaw. With expected changes in habitat conditions due to climate change, we propose that null model analyses can be used as an early warning system for community change.																			2045-7758					DEC	2024	14	12							e70622	10.1002/ece3.70622	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.70622								39629176					WOS:001369901700001

Drought conditions in this basin extended into the wintering season, significantly influencing waterfowl habitat availability. Exploring how waterfowl distributions and ecological niches respond to these changes in wetland environmental conditions and the underlying ecological mechanisms are important for biodiversity conservation and understanding wetland ecological processes. By integrating field observations, remote sensing, and ecological niche modelling, we analysed habitat changes over the past decade and investigated how extreme drought affected the distribution patterns and spatial niches of two waterfowl guilds, ducks and geese, in the Dongting Lake Region, a key wetland ecosystem in the Yangtze River Basin. The extreme drought led to a drastic reduction in the waterbody area of natural habitats and caused vegetation to enter the wilting stage prematurely. In response, a substantial proportion of waterfowl shifted to adjacent managed wetlands with stable water levels, especially the ducks, whose distribution pattern was fundamentally altered. The proportion of both waterfowl guilds in the managed wetland showed a significant correlation with the proportion of the waterbody area. Further, we compared the spatial niche of waterfowl in 2022 with that in the former year, which represented a typical year with normal hydrology. The spatial niche of ducks underwent a substantial contraction, while that of geese remained large in both years but shifted inward in 2022 towards areas with lower elevation, and foraging resource use was altered. Therefore, for both waterfowl guilds, the extent of habitat overlap between the two years was small. This study has important implications for understanding the impact of extreme climatic and hydrological events on wetland ecosystems. Furthermore, our results emphasise the importance of water level-managed wetlands for biodiversity conservation.

J	Dunalska, JA				Dunalska, Julita A.			How the integrated engineering solutions can support the lakes restoration?	ECOHYDROLOGY & HYDROBIOLOGY												A method of the simultaneous reduction of external and internal load of phosphorus as a new solution for lake restoration is presented. A flow-through, stratified lake, with diverse morphometry was selected for the study. In all three parts of the lake, an oxygen deficit was noted at the lake bottom at peak summer stagnation, with a simultaneous increase in mineral forms of phosphorus (the concentration of orthophosphates at sites I, II and III reached 0.301, 0.318 and 0.395 mg P l(-1), respectively). Additionally, a large load of nutrients originating from the main inflow (annual load of 14395.9 kg P y(-1) and 16 4829.8 kg N y(-1)), indicates that the conditions present in the lake are conducive to more intensive eutrophication. In this situation, reduction of the main loads of nutrients can be achieved by the simultaneous employment of pipelines delivering oxygenated water to the lake bottom during summer stagnation and a pipeline withdrawing deoxygenated and nutrient-rich water from the bottom in the vicinity of the outflow from the lake. It has been calculated that during the period of summer stagnation (VI-IX), the operation of delivering pipelines can reduce the phosphorus load from the main inflow by 5800.5 kg (40.3%). Using the pipeline withdrawing (site III), the amount of phosphorus removed from the lake would increase by 30.4% (from 2259.6 kg to 3247.8 kg). An additional solution, can be dosing the precipitating substances into the pipes delivering water to the lake, which will enable precise inactivation of phosphorus. (C) 2021 The Author.

J	Xue, JQ; Wen, RL; Xiao, JL; Zhang, SR; Xu, QH				Xue, Jiaqi; Wen, Ruilin; Xiao, Jule; Zhang, Shengrui; Xu, Qinghai			Vegetational succession and climatic variability in the monsoonal margin over the past three millennia as indicated by pollen influx data from Daihai Lake, Inner Mongolia	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												In recent years, the impact of global warming has received increasing attention, and changes in climatic factors such as temperature and precipitation are certain to affect vegetation succession. To assess the impact of climate change on future vegetation succession more effectively, we need to obtain information from the history of vegetation succession. Here, we present a detailed record of the vegetation coverage in the northern margin of East Asian summer monsoon from 812 BCE to 2011 CE based on a well-dated high-resolution pollen influx record from Daihai Lake. The results showed that there were two different stages of high pollen influx: 812 to 500 BCE, when the forest coverage in the Daihai Lake region was the highest, and 1050 to 1550 CE, when the Daihai Lake region was covered by dense grassland vegetation. In other stages, especially after 1550 CE, the vegetation coverage in the Daihai Lake region was relatively sparse. Then, we compared the pollen influx record of Daihai Lake with proxy climate records from high and low latitudes as well as the solar variability through the last 3000 years. We found that the vegetation coverage in the Daihai Lake area was higher when the climate was cooler and wetter and lower when the climate was warmer and drier. We speculate that the vegetation coverage in the marginal region was substantially controlled by moisture conditions and was related to the hydrographic processes of the surface ocean in the tropical Pacific.					; Zhang, Shengrui/P-1390-2019	wen, rui lin/0000-0002-1875-4623; 													1040-6182	1873-4553				FEB 10	2024	682						1	7		10.1016/j.quaint.2024.01.017	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2024.01.017		FEB 2024											WOS:001196488000001

Concentrations of the in situ produced cosmogenic radionuclide Be-10 in bedrock from the three highest terraces surrounding Sumxi Co, situated in Western Kunlun, indicate that the highest lake-level appeared before 10,000-11,500 yr, and most likely between 11,000 and 12,800 yr. Younger ages for the two lower terraces imply regression of Sumxi Co during the early-mid Holocene. The concurrency of the highest lake-level with orbitally induced maximum northern hemisphere summer insolation suggests that the increase in water supply to Sumxi Co was most likely associated with increased recharge from melting glaciers. We conclude that the enhanced Indian monsoon during the early Holocene did not penetrate the Tibetan plateau and affect the northwestern part of Tibet significantly. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Woo, MK; Young, KL				Woo, MK; Young, KL			High Arctic wetlands: Their occurrence, hydrological characteristics and sustainability	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY					7th INTECOL International Wetland Conference	JUL 25-30, 2004	Utrecht, NETHERLANDS	Utrecht Univ, Landscape Ecol Grp, Int & Natl Sci Comm				High Arctic wetlands, though limited in occurrence, are an important ecological niche, providing the major vegetated areas in an and and cold polar desert environment. These wetlands are often found as patches in the barren landscape. At a few locales which may be ice-wedge polygonal grounds, glacial terrain and zones of recent coastal uplift, wetland occurrence can become extensive, forming a mosaic that comprises patches of different wetland types. Reliable water supply during the thawed season is a deciding factor in wetland sustainability. The sources include meltwater from late-lying snowbanks, localized ground water discharge, streamflow, inundation by lakes and the sea, and for some ice-wedge wetlands, ground-ice melt. Different types of wetlands have their own characteristics, and peat accumulation or diatom depositions are common. The peat cover insulates the wetland from summer heating and encourages permafrost aggradation, with the feedback that a shallow frost table reduces the moisture storage capacity in a thinly thawed layer, which becomes easily saturated. All the wetlands studied have high calcium content since they are formed on carbonate terrain. Coastal wetlands have high salt concentration while snowmelt and ground-ice melt provides dilution. The sustainability of High Arctic wetlands is predicated upon water supply exceeding the losses to evaporation and lateral drainage. Disturbances due to natural causes such as climatic variations, geomorphic changes, or human-induced drainage, can reduce inundation opportunities or increase outflow. Then, the water table drops, the vegetation changes and the peat degrades, leading to the detriment of the wetlands. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

J	Doubek, JP; Lehman, JT				Doubek, Jonathan P.; Lehman, John T.			Historical trophic position of Limnocalanus macrurus in Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												In Lake Michigan, oligotrophication and invasive species proliferation have led to dramatic changes in the planktonic food web. Limnocalanus macrurus is a native, glacial relict predatory copepod whose trophic role within the zooplankton community may help us better understand the dynamics behind those changes. We applied nitrogen isotope spectrometry to zooplankton from Lake Michigan to quantify the yearly and seasonal position of Limnocalanus and other taxa in the historical Lake Michigan planktonic food web. We found that Limnocalanus was positioned about one-half trophic level above Bythotrephes and about two levels above Daphnia during the summer in 1989, 1993, 1995 and 1997. It was unlikely that adult Limnocalanus encountered Bythotrephes during summer months because of vertical segregation during thermal stratification. Instead, Limnocalanus probably had greater access to copepod prey such as Diaptomus and Epischura. Limnocalanus became isotopically lighter seasonally in relation to Daphnia and either shifted its diet to one consisting of more phytoplankton, or its prey (e.g., Diaptomus) shifted to a more phytoplankton food base, thus indirectly resulting in decreased trophic status of Limnocalanus. This study serves as a historical, foundational basis for zooplankton food web relations in Lake Michigan that complements similar investigation in Lake Huron. Comparing the historical to the recent zooplankton food web may now elucidate how invasive species such as Bythotrephes and quagga mussels have altered zooplankton communities and bioenergetic relationships within the Great Lakes.

First, ice processes in the St Clair River mouth are presented. The river mouth, called St. Clair Flats is a typical river delta located on the shore of Lake St. Clair. Based on this example ice jam formation in river delta has been analyzed followed by a presentation of the main mechanism of ice jam formation. The Vistula River mouth is a man-made, artificial channel which was built in the 19th century in order to prevent the formation of ice jams in the natural river delta. The Vistula River releases large amounts of fresh water into the Baltic Sea which freezes in the winter season during which northerly winds prevail causing the drifting ice to move southwards and accumulate to form ice jams in the river mouth. For this reason ice breaking operations are performed. Since the artificial river outlet was constructed, no severe ice related flood risk situations have ever occurred. However, periodic ice-related phenomena still have an impact on the river operation. This paper presents the application of the calibrated mathematical model DynaRICE to perform a 'series of simulation in the Vistula River mouth for winter storm condition to determine the effects of ice on the water level in the Vistula River and ice jam potential of the river outlet.

J	REA, N; GANF, GG				REA, N; GANF, GG			HOW EMERGENT PLANTS EXPERIENCE WATER REGIME IN A MEDITERRANEAN-TYPE WETLAND	AQUATIC BOTANY												In Southern Australia where water levels fluctuate and are naturally variable, the importance of water regime, as distinct from water depth, was shown and the difference between depth and elevation gradients was verified. The water regimes at sites across an elevation gradient were described and quantified. The Sum Water Regime, an index of the hydrological past that plants had experienced, was a summary of depth and duration of inundation. It was calculated over monthly intervals (1, 3, 6, 12 months) prior to plant harvests and on a daily scale (for each record of water level: 1-30 days). It identified the response times of two emergent species at the level of the population (live aboveground mass, g m(-2), and shoot density, number per m(2)). Triglochin procerum R.Br. had a rapid response time with population changes matching changes in depth. In contrast, Baumea arthrophylla (Nees) Boeckeler had a slower response time with its characteristics correlated to the past water regime integrated over 6-12 months. At the level of photosynthetic organs, the change in the mean heights of T. placer um leaves across a spring depth gradient, paralleled the change in the maximum heights. Height and diameter also changed in proportion. For B. arthrophylla, the maximum height of its stems increased across the sampled gradient, but the mean heights fell at the deeper sites. Coupled with the finding that increases in diameter did not keep pace with increases in height, these results showed that T. procerum, unlike B. arthrophylla, was well within its depth limits. Populations were sampled across the range of water regimes they experienced. This highlighted the significant effect small changes in water regime have on the structure and performance of aquatic plants. Measuring the range of characteristics, not only identifies the upper and lower limits, but may be used to predict the condition of other populations.																			0304-3770					AUG	1994	49	2-3					117	136		10.1016/0304-3770(94)90033-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(94)90033-7													WOS:A1994PY53500004

This fresh water ecosystem has been well studied, including investigations of its photoautotrophic picoplankton (PPP). Previous studies revealed that picoeukaryotes could reach an extremely high abundance in winter, while picocyanobacteria are the predominant picoplankters in warmer periods, as in other lakes in the temperate zone. In addition to epifluorescence microscopy-which allows discrimination only between phycocyanin-rich picocyanobacteria, phycoerythrin-rich picocyanobacteria and picoeukaryotic algae-we used PCR-based molecular methods to reveal the detailed genetic diversity and seasonal dynamics of the PPP in Lake Balaton for the first time. Our results show that a single integrated pelagic sample, taken vertically from the whole water column, may harbor a large number of picocyanobacterial genotypes including previously unidentified groups. Based on length polymorphism analysis of the phycocyanin operon (which contains a non-coding region of variable size), the composition of picocyanobacterial communities showed significant seasonal changes and spatial variation. The relative importance of some of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) we detected was correlated with environmental factors, such as temperature and the concentration of available nitrogen forms. The picoeukaryotic algal community of winter PPP was dominated by chlorophytes related to the group Trebouxiophyceae. The results of this study highlight the fine internal structure and dynamics of the PPP community in freshwater ecosystems-a view that is usually blurred by the lower resolution of commonly used methods, such as epifluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry.

Here we present the first comprehensive study of Ephemeroptera in the tufa-depositing habitats of the Dinaric Karst. The study was conducted in Plitvice Lakes National Park monthly during a one-year period (2007-2008) in different types of habitats (springs, streams, mountainous rivers, tufa barriers). The aims of the study were to determine mayfly composition, abundance, spatial distribution and habitat preferences, and to examine the environmental factors important for the structuring of mayfly assemblages in Plitvice Lakes National Park. The mayfly fauna of tufa-depositing habitats was composed of 14 species (20 taxa). Water temperature, pH and ammonium concentration were the most important environmental variables explaining mayfly assemblages. Mayfly assemblages grouped according to habitat type. Generally, the most favourable habitat type was mountainous stream, tufa barriers were less favourable, and the least favourable were springs. Our results confirmed that mayflies are a powerful tool as descriptors of their environment, as the presence or absence of certain mayflies was strongly influenced by physico-chemical water properties.					; Mihaljevic, Zlatko/ABN-3601-2022; Stankovic, Vlatka/AAY-6001-2021; Vilenica, Marina/L-2927-2019; Sartori, Michel/AAT-9599-2020	Sartori, Michel/0000-0003-3397-3397; Vilenica, Marina/0000-0003-2053-2461; 													1961-9502						2017		418							14	10.1051/kmae/2017005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/kmae/2017005													WOS:000399051100014
J	Kim, Y; Kim, B				Kim, Yoonhee; Kim, Bomchul			Application of a 2-dimensional water quality model (CE-QUAL-W2) to the turbidity interflow in a deep reservoir (Lake Soyang, Korea)	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												The temporal and spatial distribution of water temperature was surveyed and simulated in a deep warm monomictic reservoir (Lake Soyang, Korea). The great depth (maximum depth 118 m) and wind-sheltered dendritic shape caused stable thermal stratification in summer. Turbid storm runoff during the summer monsoon formed a 20-40 m intermediate layer distinct from the clearer epilimnion and hypolimnion. The temperature distribution and movements of the density current were simulated by using the 2-dimensional hydrologic model, CE-QUAL-W2. The model was calibrated with data from 1996 and verified with data from 1995-2002 by applying the same set of parameters and constants as used in calibration. The model could simulate temperature profiles with excellent agreement. Movement of the intermediate density current also was well simulated. The CE-QUAL-W2 model was useful in the prediction of temperature distribution and movement of density current in reservoirs, which implies merit for further employment of this model in water quality simulations.																			1040-2381	2151-5530				SEP	2006	22	3					213	222		10.1080/07438140609353898	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438140609353898													WOS:000243027700004

J	Jeffrey, JD; Edds, DR				Jeffrey, JD; Edds, DR			Spring movements and spawning habitat of sauger (Stizostedion canadense) in a small midwestern USA reservoir	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												We conducted a biotelemetry study to assess spring movements and locate spawning areas of sauger (Stizostedion canadense) in a small (2800 ha.) Kansas reservoir lacking large river inflow. Twenty adult sauger were implanted with ultrasonic tags and tracked in Melvern Lake from February to June 1993. Movements, calculated as minimum displacement from 254 fish fixes, were greatest in March (P<0.003) prior to the spawn, ranging to 2.8 km/d. Male sauger inhabited deeper water than females (P=0.04). Multiple regression analysis revealed that water column depth utilized by sauger was a function of barometric pressure and reservoir inflow/discharge. Tagged sauger inhabited different lake regions throughout the study period (P<0.001), moving from mid-lower lake in February to down-lake north shores for the April spawn and dispersing thereafter. In April, at water temperatures of approximately 8 C, sauger congregated in mainstem shoals, where they apparently spawned in shallow (1-2 m) water over cobble, pebble, and clay-silt substrates.																			0270-5060					SEP	1999	14	3					385	397		10.1080/02705060.1999.9663694	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1999.9663694													WOS:000082534100014
J	Cossette, C; Rodríguez, MA				Cossette, C; Rodríguez, MA			Summer use of a small stream by fish and crayfish and exchanges with adjacent lentic macrohabitats	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Movements between a stream reach and two adjacent lentic macrohabitats, a beaver pond and a lake, were followed for the Appalachian crayfish and two fish species, brook charr and brown bullhead, over an 85-d period from early June to late August, and were analysed in relation to water level, maximum water temperature, photoperiod length, lunar luminosity, and age, by use of time-series regressions. 2. Brook charr showed strong net immigration to the stream reach for underyearling (age class 0+) fish but net emigration for 1+ fish. Both immigration and emigration were positively related to water level and temperature; migratory responses to temperature were age-specific. 3. Brown bullhead used the stream primarily as a corridor for downstream migration from the beaver pond to the lake. As with brook charr, water level and temperature had a positive effect on movement and responses were stronger in younger individuals. 4. Crayfish emigrated from the stream during the summer. Movements were positively related to increases in water level and temperature, with responses of 1+ crayfish much stronger than those of older individuals. 5. The results indicate that the stream tributary played different roles for brook charr (nursery), brown bullhead (dispersal corridor) and Appalachian crayfish (early summer refuge), and suggest that variation in water level or temperature resulting from climatic change or local anthropogenic activities might modify connectivity between macrohabitats, particularly for younger individuals.

Local glaciers record delayed peak Holocene warmth in south Greenland	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Local glaciers and ice caps (GICs) respond sensitively and quickly, on the scale of decades to centuries, to climate variations. Continuous records of past fluctuations in GIC size provide information on the timing and magnitude of Holocene climate shifts, and a longer-term perspective on 21st century glacier retreat. Although there is broad-scale agreement on millennial-scale trends in Holocene climate variability and fluctuations in local GICs in Greenland, regional variations are only loosely constrained. Here we present three Holocene proglacial lake sediment records from South Greenland, an area with abundant local glaciers but few Holocene-length paleoclimate records. In addition, we use geospatial analysis to model past equilibrium-line altitudes (ELAs) and thereby constrain the magnitude of ablation-season temperature change during the warmest and coolest periods of the Holocene. Physical and geochemical sedimentary characteristics show that two of the proglacial lakes continued to receive glacial meltwater input until similar to 7.3 and similar to 7.1 ka BP. The survival of local glaciers implies that South Greenland remained relatively cool, and that summer temperatures gradually warmed, but did not warm well beyond 1.2 degrees C above present in the early Holocene. In the mid-Holocene, from similar to 7.1 to 5.5 ka BP, organic sedimentation at these two sites indicates that local glaciers became very small, or more likely melted away completely. The glaciers within the third lake's catchment melted away prior to similar to 5.2 ka BP, as sediments deposited earlier in the Holocene could not be dated at this site. We estimate that summer temperatures increased by at least 1.2-1.8 degrees C above present by similar to 7.3-7.1 ka BP. Our results are consistent with other observations that suggest a north-to-south gradient in the timing of Holocene thermal maximum conditions, with southern Greenland experiencing a delayed warming relative to other regions in Greenland. As summer temperatures cooled in the Neoglacial, our records show that sustained glacier regrowth began similar to 3.1 ka BP with glaciers in the southernmost catchment, which at present, receive the most precipitation. In the other two catchments, which host smaller glaciers in a drier environment, regrowth began at similar to 1.3 and similar to 1.2 ka BP, the timing of which is in agreement with other glacial records from the Arctic Atlantic region. Local glaciers reached their maximum late Holocene extents during a cooler, second phase of the Little Ice Age (LIA) similar to 0.2-0.1 ka BP, that we estimate was at least 0.4-0.9 degrees C cooler than present. Overall, these findings improve understanding of the spatio-temporal dynamics of Holocene glacier and climate change in Greenland, potentially yielding valuable information about their future response.

The current study evaluated the possible contribution of dust from such a pollution source, a limestone quarry in north Israel, during the dry summer season. Accumulated dust and total suspended particulate matter were collected following an analysis of the prevailing synoptic conditions to evaluate the background dust, its origin and expected mineralogical and chemical properties. We performed comparative gravimetric, chemical and mineralogical analyses between sites lying upwind and downwind of the limestone quarry and defined the background dust and its origin. During the summer season under the Persian trough synoptic system, mineral dust in the research area was mostly composed of material similar to the local lithosphere, mainly carbonate rocks, and thus to the quarried rock. High concentrations of some trace metals, on the other hand, were related to remote sources, as has been documented previously for the Persian trough synoptic condition. Gravimetric analysis found 300 to 400% more accumulated dust and up to 400% more total suspended particulate matter about 1 km downwind versus upwind of the quarry. Mineralogical and chemical analyses of the dust samples, and of the quarried rock, revealed that the downwind site is enriched, relative to the upwind site, in the major component of the quarried rock calcite, and that both sites are enriched in the major components of background dust.

The main stages in the lake's evolution indicate the following: (1) eutrophic conditions in the final stage of the Lateglacial, (2) very low trophy and strongly changeable water levels in the early Holocene, (3) slowly rising trophy through the mid- and late Holocene enabling persistence of the oligotrophic state of the lake up to c. AD 1450, (4) strong cultural eutrophication of the lake in the recent period (c. 150 years), and (5) maximum Ca content in the early Holocene followed by a gradual decline to minimum values in recent time. Distinct, concurrent shifts in limnological proxies and tree pollen accumulation rates (PARs) enabled the identification of several potential Holocene cool climatic events of different magnitudes and durations. Strong reduction in Tetraedron minimum and declines in tree PARs illustrate limitation of physiological processes in plants, which could result from shorter growing seasons and lower summer temperatures and insolation. Higher precipitation of Fe and Mn indicates more intensive weathering in the catchment, while peaks in Fe/Mn ratio and concurrent drops in Ca content suggest at least seasonal anoxia, which could result from a longer duration of ice cover and shorter periods of mixing. The data seem to display striking conformity of the main cooling events with the "Bond cycles" (Bond et al., 1997, 2001), but also indicate a more variable pattern that may reflect traces of a more complex cyclicity of climatic shifts.

Due to the high salt concentration they are more or less isolated from each other geographically. All populations examined from 1943-1974 are characterized by a different degree of scale reduction. During the 30 yr of observation, changes took place concerning the scale covering. Well scaled fish showed a decrease in scalation and vice versa. Genetic mechanisms such as random drift, gene substitution, transfer of gene function, etc., were examined for the changes. It did not take long for their manifestation in the micropopulations to become evident. During the last 20 yr there were occasional high water levels which broke down isolation borders for gene flow between the different populations. The degree of isolation depends on the distance between the springs and the lake, on the quantity of water in the springs and primarily on the changes in the water level. The occasional gene flow between the populations led to a leveling of the frequency of scalation types. Since 1954 there has been a decrease in the extreme types of scalation (fully scaled or scale reduced) and an increase in the fish with medium scalation. The amount of fish belonging to the extreme scalation types was much higher at the beginning of the investigation period than it was at the end. In 1974, a nearly equal distribution of fish of the 4 different scalation types was found.																			0044-3808						1979	17	4					272	280																WOS:A1979HY47300003

We characterized deposits in a laminated section within the sedimentary record from Lake Chalco, Basin of Mexico. The laminated sediments are intercalated with massive sediments, volcaniclastic material and 13 micritic mud layers. This laminated sequence corresponds to the depth interval 122.5 to 106 m and has an age > 130 ka, corresponding with the end of the penultimate glacial stage or Marine Isotopic Stage 6 (MIS 6). Dark and light lamina, as well as the micritic mud components, were identified by microscopic observation of sediment smear slides; some sediment in the dark laminae, light laminae and micritic mud layers was also analyzed using a scanning electron microscope. X-ray fluorescence was used to determine Ti content and Si/Ti and Ca/Ti ratios. These analyses enabled us to determine that the light laminae have high Si/Ti values, are formed mostly by diatom valves (Stephanodiscus niagarae and S. oregonicus), and represent a biogenic diatom ooze. Dark laminae have high Ti values and are formed mainly by clastic sediments including plagioclases and amphiboles. We propose an annual depositional model in which light laminae correspond to winter diatom blooms, whereas dark laminae were deposited by allochthonous inwash during the summer rainy season, thus forming a biogenic-clastic varve. Diatom ecology suggests the laminated sequence corresponds to a relatively deep, eutrophic to hypertrophic lake with cool to cold waters. This inference is consistent with the age of the deposits, which corresponds with the penultimate glacial maximum or MIS 6, for which we infer cooler and moistier conditions than for the last glacial maximum i. e. MIS 2. Sedimentation rates estimated by varve counts suggest that the laminated sequence was deposited during a similar to 5000 yr interval. The micritic mud layers have high Ca/Ti and Si/Ti ratios and are formed mainly by authigenic carbonates, sponge spicules, diatoms and ostracode valves. We propose that these chemical facies were deposited during periods of higher evaporation and water concentration and also lower lake level and high biological productivity. The recurrence of these events must be further studied, but based on the mean sedimentation rate of 2.9 mm/yr, calculated from varve counting we suggest that they have a 140-yr to 280-yr recurrence interval.																			1026-8774					AUG	2018	35	2					168	178		10.22201/cgeo.20072902e.2018.2.649	http://dx.doi.org/10.22201/cgeo.20072902e.2018.2.649													WOS:000440803000005

T.; Scheuhammer, Tony; Shaw, Patrick			Mercury in Forage Fish from Mexico and Central America: Implications for Fish-Eating Birds	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												Mercury (Hg) is a global contaminant of aquatic food chains. Aquatic birds, such as the osprey (Pandion haliaetus), with migratory populations breeding in Canada and the northern United States and wintering in the Central and South America, can be exposed to mercury on both the breeding and wintering ranges. We examined Hg levels in 14 fish taxa from 24 osprey wintering sites identified from satellite telemetry. Our main goal was to determine whether fish species that feature in the diet of overwintering and resident fish-eating birds reached toxicity thresholds for Hg. Mean Hg levels in fish whole carcasses ranged from a high of 0.18 A mu g g(-1) (wet weight) in Scomberomorus sierra to a low of 0.009 A mu g g(-1) in Catostomidae. Average Hg levels were within published toxicity threshold values in forage fish for only two sites in Mexico (Puerto Vallarta and San Blas Estuary), and all were marine species, such as mackerel (Scomberomorus sierra), sea catfish (Ariopus spp.), and sardinas species (Centropomus spp.). Except for one sample from Nicaragua, sea catfish from Puerto Morazan, none of the fish from sites in Central America had Hg levels which exceeded the thresholds. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling revealed geographical differences in Hg levels with significant pairwise differences between sites along the Pacific Ocean (Mexico) versus the Bay of Campeche, partly due to differences in species composition of sampled fish (and species distributions). Hg increased with trophic level, as assessed by nitrogen stable isotope ratios (delta N-15 but not delta C-13), in freshwater and marine, but not estuarine, environments. Hg concentrations in forage fish do not account for the elevated Hg reported for many osprey populations on the breeding grounds, thus primary sources of contamination appear to be in the north.

Char younger than 5 yr occur in shallow waters in Stanwell-Fletcher Lake [Canada] and apparently feed rarely on Mysis as indicated by infrequent infection with C. cristivomeri. Older fish that adopt a migratory habit and go to sea for the summer appear to feed little on Mysis when they return to overwinter in the lake. Small, slow-growing char present in the lake during summer were commonly infected with C. cristivomeri indicating they feed heavily on Mysis. These small fish, which are as old as many migrants, may not participate regularly in the seaward migration.																									1978	35	11					1488	1491		10.1139/f78-234	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f78-234													WOS:A1978FW88600014

The South Virgin-White Hills detachment fault, southeastern Nevada and northwestern Arizona: Significance, displacement gradient, and corrugation formation	MIOCENE TECTONICS OF THE LAKE MEAD REGION, CENTRAL BASIN AND RANGE	Geological Society of America Special Papers											Three major low-angle normal faults in the eastern Lake Mead area, Nevada and Arizona, are segments of a regional, 55-km-long, detachment fault. This fault, the South Virgin-White Hills detachment, consists of the Lakeside Mine, Salt Spring, and Cyclopic Mine fault segments. All three segments dip gently west and record top-to-the-west displacement. Based on apatite fission-track and apatite and titanite (U-Th)/He thermochronology of footwall rocks, tilt relations, and (40)Ar/(39)Ar dates on tuffs and basalts within hanging-wall synextensional sedimentary sequences, significant extension along the South Virgin-White Hills detachment occurred between 16.5 and 14 Ma. Minor extension continued until ca. 8 Ma. Displacement on the South Virgin-White Hills detachment decreases from a maximum of similar to 17 km at the Gold Butte block in the north to 5-6 km at the Cyclopic Mine in the south. The along-strike, southward decrease in displacement is accompanied by a change in type of fault rock from mylonite along the Lakeside Mine fault (northern segment), to chloritic cataclasite along the Salt Spring fault (central segment), to unconsolidated fault breccia along the Cyclopic Mine fault (southern segment). Differences in fault rock may reflect decreasing exhumation of footwall rocks as a result of decreased displacement to the south. About 40% of the displacement gradient can be accommodated along a series of left-slip faults in the upper plate of the detachment. The Golden Rule Peak lineament, an east-trending alignment of structural and topographic features, may be a transverse structure that accommodates differential displacement between the Salt Spring and Cyclopic Mine faults. The trace of the South Virgin-White Hills detachment is highly sinuous in map view and is marked by three prominent salients that define west-plunging antiformal warps in the detachment surface. We interpret the corrugations in the South Virgin-White Hills detachment to have formed by a process of linkage of originally separate en echelon fault segments followed by eastward tilting of the footwall. Depositional patterns, particularly between the Lakeside Mine and Salt Spring segments, support this interpretation. The Grand Wash fault forms the present-day physiographic boundary between the Colorado Plateau and the Basin and Range Provinces; however, based on greater amount of displacement and exhumation, we suggest that the South Virgin-White Hills detachment is the principal structure accommodating regional extension in the eastern Lake Mead extensional domain.																			0072-1077		978-0-8137-2463-8				2010	463						275	287		10.1130/2010.2463(12)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/2010.2463(12)													WOS:000286214300012

The temporal-spatial distributions, potential sources, water-SPM partition and ecological risks of OCPs were studied. Total 17 OCP components were detected with total contents of 172.68 +/- 434.88 ng/g. The total DDT parent compounds and their metabolic products (DDXs), with a total average content of 138.76 +/- 407.27 ng/g, was the predominant components. The compositions of OCPs, DDXs and HCHs in the SPM were very similar to those in the air particulate, especially in spring and summer. Temporally, the highest residual levels of DDXs, HCHs and OCPs were found in August, which is very similar to temporal distribution trends in the water. Spatially, the highest residual levels of DDXs and OCPs in the SPM were found in the eastern lake area, followed by the western and the central lake areas. There were significant positive relationships between the contents of OCPs and DDXs in the SPM and those in the water. All water-SPM partition coefficient (K-d) values of OCPs were higher than 1, except those for p, p'-DDE, p, p'-DDT, HCB and gamma-chlordane. The ratios of o, p'-/p, p'-DDT and DDT/(DDD + DDE) for all detectable SPM samples were less and greater than 1.00, respectively, which might indicate the new inputs of industrial DDTs. The ratios of alpha-/gamma-HCH and beta-/(alpha+gamma)-HCH were less than 4 and 0.5, respectively, for the most of detectable SPM samples, which might demonstrate the recent inputs of lindane. The DDT and DDX residues in some SPM samples exceeded their corresponding probable effect concentrations, which indicated their adverse effects on the aquatic organisms.

Design, installation and preliminary testing of a permeable reactive barrier for diesel fuel remediation at Casey Station, Antarctica	COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												To minimize the environmental impact of a fuel spill a permeable bio-reactive barrier (PRB) was designed and installed at Australia's Casey Station. The PRB was designed to prevent further migration of a decade-old fuel spill during summer melt periods by intercepting catchment flow down-gradient of the spill. Catchment flow was intercepted using a PRB with a funnel and gate design. This is the first time a full-scale PRB has been designed and installed specifically for polar regions. This paper reports on the selection of a location for a PRB, and the subsequent design, installation and testing of the PRB throughout the first summer of operation at Casey Station, Antarctica. The PRB was designed to test five different treatments. Each treatment contained three zones: a zone of slow fertilizer release to enhance biodegradation; a zone for hydrocarbon and nutrient capture and degradation; and a zone for cation capture to contain excess nutrients released in the first zone. The materials used within these zones were required to have no adverse impact on the environment; be permeable enough to capture the entire catchment flow during the peak summer melt period without overtopping; have the ability to deliver nutrients in a controlled way; and have sufficient residence time to fully capture migrating hydrocarbons. The first zone tested different types of slow release fertilizer: MaxBac (TM), ZeoPro (TM) and zeolite preconditioned with ammonium. Sand was used for a control. For the capture of hydrocarbons the second zone contained granulated activated carbon and either: Raw St Cloud zeolite, sodium Australian zeolite, or ZeoPro. The capture of cations in the third zone was achieved with sodium Australian zeolite. The grain size of each material was relatively uniform and large enough (c. 0.4 to 3.5 mm) to keep the water holding capacity to a minimum at the end of the melt period, thereby maximizing permeability at the onset of the next season's melt. The PRB was keyed into the permafrost with insulation to limit the potential for flow bypassing the treatment zone, and sized to intercept the maximum flux of melt water through the upper catchment where the spill occurred. Testing of the nutrient delivery systems was performed by pumping contaminated water from a down-gradient melt lake through the PRB. Nutrient sampling indicated that all the nutrient sources chosen were able to supply ammonium to the hydrocarbon capture zone for 4 to 5 years at concentrations > 1 mg L- 1 (N as NH4+) and the ion exchange materials (zeolites) were found to maintain ammonium concentrations at a more consistent concentration than the coated nutrient material MaxBac (TM). Zeolite also effectively prevented off-site migration of ammonium.

In addition, falling water levels worsen air quality by exposing desiccated shores. To our knowledge, however, no published hedonic study has analyzed the costs of deteriorating water quality jointly with the air quality impacts of falling water levels for a large inland water body. We conduct such an analysis for the Salton Sea, the largest lake in California. Our spatial autoregressive models estimated on single-family properties located within 10 miles (16.1 km) of the Sea show that a 1 km reduction in distance to the Sea results in a $595 decrease in the price of a single-family residence. In addition, a 1% increase in annual particulate matter concentration reduces the value of the average family residence by $1,140. These results highlight the vulnerability of poor rural communities to deteriorating environmental conditions.					; Saphores, Jean/Q-5445-2019	Saphores, Jean-Daniel/0000-0001-9514-0994; 													0964-0568	1360-0559				DEC 6	2018	61	14					2549	2569		10.1080/09640568.2017.1405799	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2017.1405799													WOS:000461621400007

J	Mieczan, T; Grzeskiewicz, M				Mieczan, Tomasz; Grzeskiewicz, Michal			The impact of climate warming on the diurnal dynamics of the microbial loop: Ice cover vs. lack of ice cover on dystrophic lakes	SAUDI JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												One of the effects of warming is earlier retreat of the ice cover or a complete lack of ice cover on water bodies in the winter. However, there is still no information on how climate warming affects the 24-hour dynamics of the planktonic microbial loop in winter. The aim of this investigation was to assess the diurnal dynamics of the taxonomic composition and abundance of microbial communities in experimentally reproduced conditions (samples from under the ice, +2, +4 and +8 degrees C) and to analyse the relationships between components of the microbial loop in relation to physical and chemical parameters. Samples were taken in winter from three dystrophic reservoir. The biological and physicochemical parameters in the water were analysed at the start (day 0), 15 and end of the experiment (day 30) over a 24-hour cycle. The increase in temperature caused an increase in the numbers of predators (particularly testate amoebae and ciliates) and a reduction in the body size of individual populations. During the period with ice cover, marked dominance of mixotrophic testate amoeba (Hyalosphenia papilio) and ciliates (Paramecium bursaria) was observed, while the increase in temperature caused an increase in the proportion of bacterivorous ciliates (Cinetochilum margaritaceum).

However, linking grain size subcomponents to specific environmental parameters is sometimes ambiguous, as grain size in lake sediments depends on local characteristics of individual lakes. In view of this, illustrative case studies with widespread practical significance are needed. Here, GSD datasets of two lake sediments from the Asian Summer Monsoon (ASM) marginal zone were decomposed and compared with nearby surficial lacustrine/eolian sediments with clear geological origins, to study the dominant sedimentary processes-grain size regimes of these two representative lakes. The decomposition and comparison clarify the geologic properties of certain grain size parameters and minimizes extraneous signals. Based on this information, we interpret certain size fractions as regional climate indicators associated with ASM intensity changes. We also consider centennial-timescale climate variability during the last half of the Holocene, and discuss the driving forces controlling centennial moisture variability in the studied area.

J	Chang, JC; Woodward, C; Shulmeister, J				Chang, Jie Christine; Woodward, Craig; Shulmeister, James			Reconstructing terrestrial temperatures in the Australian sub-tropics and tropics: A chironomid based transfer function approach	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												This paper presents chironomid-based transfer functions for temperature reconstructions intended for use in the Australian tropics and sub-tropics. Temperature was the primary independent control of chironomid assemblages. Two transfer functions were created to infer mean annual (MAT) and mean summer temperature as represented by February temperatures (MFT) as it was not reasonable to automatically assume that chironomid populations in the tropics are controlled by summer temperatures. Weighted average partial least square (WA-PLS) models were the most robust. For MAT they produced a coefficient of determination (r(jack)(2)) of 0.83, a maximum bias of 1.74 degrees C and a root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) of 2.35 degrees C while for MFT an r(jack)(2) of 0.76, maximum bias of 2.43 degrees C, and RMSEP of 2.43 degrees C was achieved. Based on the statistics we recommend that the MAT model is used for chironomid work in tropical regions. Though chironomid head capsule counts were low, we tentatively applied the MAT function to published Holocene chironomid data from Lake Barrine, northeast Queensland. The results suggest only minor temperature change through the last 9000 years. Based on other proxies, this appears to result in realistic temperature reconstructions. Consequently we highlight that sub-fossil chironomids have the potential to provide high quality temperature records for the Australian tropics. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

Power density spectra were computed along vector components and clockwise and counterclockwise components. Coherence and phase were computed between surface and bottom currents at the same mooring, and between current and wind stress. The analysis reveals a varied response of currents to wind stress throughout the basin and indicates the existence of complicated hydraulic and wind-induced circulation patterns. The principal axes and mean direction of the measured currents shows that the flow is strongly influenced by bottom topography. The numerous islands in the Kingston basin affect the circulation. The record mean flow along the north side of Amherst Island is weak; however, the currents exhibit high variability in response to barotropic pressure gradients induced by wind-driven water level set-up, with the flow around Amherst Island being 180-degrees out of phase with the wind. During the summer months the flow in the Kingston basin is stratified, resulting in two-layer flow at the boundary between the basin and Lake Ontario. The mean currents in the epilimnion move landward toward the St. Lawrence River mouth while the mean currents in the hypolimnion move lakeward toward Lake Ontario through three deep channels.

We analyzed the linmological conditions of the lake during the mid 1960s, prior to major dam construction on its main tributaries. At that time, large volumes (25.4 km(3) yr(1)) of highly turbid (up to 180 JTU) but anthropogenically phosphate-enriched water entered the south end via the Kootenay River. This interacted with smaller volumes of less turbid and much lower nutrient waters entering from the Duncan River in the north and lateral lake drainages (15.6 and 9.8 km(3) yr(1) respectively) to produce complex spatial and temporal differences in physical and chemical features (temperature, light penetration, ionic composition, pH, dissolved oxygen and nutrients) as well as in phytoplankton biomass, productivity and taxonomic composition. In the southern part of the lake, phytoplankton biomass, cell density and C-14 uptake rates were severely depressed during late spring and summer by light limitation from incoming silt turbidity, in spite of high phosphate concentrations. In contrast, phytoplankton stock and production was elevated in the middle to northern parts where transparency was high. Experimental algal bioassays using filtered lake waters demonstrated that through this period nutrient (primarily phosphorus) limitation occurred in the northern but not in the southern parts of Kootenay Lake. Watershed impoundments during the 1970s homogenized and simplified this ecosystem. On-going efforts to rebuild fisheries through restoration of the pre-dam nutrient loading may not return Kootenay Lake to the spatial and temporal complexity that once existed.

Sinninghe; Schouten, Stefan			Twentieth century proxy records of temperature and soil organic matter input in the Drammensfjord, southern Norway	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												The Drammensfjord, in southern Norway, is an enclosed anoxic basin with a laminated sedimentary record. The fjord is a transition area between the marine and terrestrial environments and thus its sedimentary archive contains information on both environments. In order to reconstruct recent environmental changes in southern Norway, two sediment cores covering the last 90 years were analyzed. We used the Branched versus Isoprenoid Tetraether (BIT) index as an indicator of terrestrial organic mater input and compared it to the stable carbon isotopic composition of total organic carbon (delta C-13(TOC)). The delta C-13(TOC) and BIT index show opposing trends, with delta C-13(TOC) indicating an increase in terrestrial input while the BIT index suggests a decrease towards the present. This contradiction is probably due to the different sources reflected by delta C-13(TOC) (vegetation, soil and anthropogenic input) and the BIT index (only soil organic matter input). In addition, an increase in the recycling of respired CO2 within the fjord's water column could have depleted the delta C-13(TOC) of the marine component towards more negative values, thus seemingly indicating an increase in terrestrial input, whilst the BIT index could have been affected by a reduction of riverine input and/or an increase in archaeal biomass production. The TetraEther indeX of lipids with 86 carbons (TEX86) was determined as a proxy for past water surface temperatures. While some of the signal could be coming from the chemocline, our results suggest that TEX86 indicates surface (upper 25 m) temperatures. Moreover, TEX86 temperature patterns seem to follow variations in the historical record of averaged spring to fall Oslo air temperature relatively closely, suggesting the signal is produced during this period. Therefore, TEX86 temperature records of fjord sediment cores can potentially be a useful tool in reconstructing past variations of coastal climates. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The results of CTD measurements show relatively high temperature and high conductivity in the Lower part of the column, possibly derived from hot springs at the crater wall approximately 150 m deep. The vertical profile of CH4 concentration shows two sharp maxima of 68 and 69 nmol/kg at depths of 20 and 150 m, respectively, The delta(13)C value of CH4 at 20 m is -55 parts per thousand PDB, suggesting microbial production in and around the lake. In contrast, the delta(13)C value of CH4 at 150 m is +11 parts per thousand PDB, which suggests some secondary isotopic alternation processes peculiar to hot spring-derived CH4 in the oxic water column, such as rapid aerobic microbial oxidation.

The present work focuses on the physico-chemical characterisation of suspended particles during high atmospheric particulate events caused by soil reclamation activities. Intensive sampling of atmospheric particulates during the period 20 May-27 December was carried out at two monitoring stations located at Aznalcazar and in the Guadiamar valley. At Aznalcazar mean daily levels of 191.2 mu gTSP m(-3) were recorded for the soil reclamation period (July-August 1998), with maximum daily levels of 490 mu gTSP m(-3). After the reclamation activities TSP progressively decreased down to levels of 90 mu gTSP m(-3) in September-October, and 40 mu gTSP m(-3) in November-December. Very high levels of major and trace elements were recorded at the two sampling sites. As for TSP, ambient air levels of major and trace elements increased sharply (two orders of magnitude) in July and August compare with the levels recorded in May and June, and gradually decreased during the autumn and winter seasons. Mean daily levels for July and August at Aznalcazar attained values-close to 2 ng m(-3) for Ag, Cd, Sn and Tl, 10 ng m(-3) for Ni, 100 ng m(-3) for Mn, 200 ng m(-3) for As and Cu, and 450 ng m(-3) for Pb and Zn. In the Guadiamar valley (where the major soil reclamation activities were carried out), the levels achieved were higher than those of Aznalcazar by a factor of 3. In September, the levels recorded at both monitoring stations decreased but were still higher than the initial values by a factor of 5, showing lower standard deviations than those in July-August. Finally, the levels recorded in December were very similar to those of May. As regards the grain-size distribution of minor and trace elements, Cu, Mn and Zn exhibit from 17 to 36% and 59 to 70% Of their bulk; levels in TSP in the PM2.5 and PM10 fractions, respectively. However, As, Cd, Co, Pb, Sb Se and Tl showed proportions from 20 to 48% and from 80 to 90% TSP in the PM2.5 and PM10 fractions, respectively. The water extractable fraction of major, minor and trace elements in TSP was different for the elements studied. Thus, Cd, Co, Tl, Mn and Se showed a water extractable proportion from 27 to 92% of their bulk content in TSP, Ni, As, Zn and Cu showed an intermediate soluble fraction which ranged from 8 to 10%,and Pb, Sb and Cr were mobile in a proportion < 4%.

It currently demonstrates several attributes characteristic of enriched waters. Algal production is high relative to other deep basin lakes of the central North Island. The hypolimnion deoxygenates completely each year, and a bloom-forming species of blue-green algae is numerically important in the summer phytoplankton. These features appear to be recent rather than longstanding properties of the Lake Rotoiti ecosystem. A detailed comparison of limnological measurements from 1955 onwards reveals a consistent decline in water clarity, a large and possibly exponential increase in hypolimnetic O2 demand, and a conspicuous shift in the summer phytoplankton community towards blue-green algal dominance. This recently accelerated change in the trophic status of Lake Rotoiti is probably a response to the Ohau Channel inflow from Lake Rotorua.

Transfer efficiency of carbon, nutrients, and polyunsaturated fatty acids in planktonic food webs under different environmental conditions	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												The trophic transfer efficiency (TTE) is an important indicator of ecosystem functioning. However, TTE data from freshwater food webs are ambiguous due to differences in time scales and methods. We investigated the transfer of essential substances (carbon, nutrients, and polyunsaturated fatty acids) through plankton communities in 30 Polish lakes with different trophic status in the middle of summer. The results of our study revealed that different essential substances were transferred from phytoplankton to zooplankton with varying efficiencies. The average TTE of C, N, P, and the sum of omega-3 PUFA were 6.55%, 9.82%, 15.82%, and 20.90%, respectively. Our results also show a large mismatch between the elemental and biochemical compositions of zooplankton and their food during the peak of the summer stagnation, which may further promote the accumulation of essential substances. There were also large differences in TTEs between trophic conditions, with the highest efficiencies in oligotrophic lakes and the lowest in dystrophic and eutrophic lakes. Therefore, our study indicates that disturbances like eutrophication and dystrophication similarly decrease the TTE of essential substances between phytoplankton and zooplankton in freshwater food webs.

Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios, C-14, delta C-13 and mineral compositions of calc-sinters, and He-3/He-4 He-4/Ne-20, delta O-18, delta D, pH and TDS of water from springs and lakes are analyzed in detail. The results indicate that the lake water is supplied through deep fault zone. The "kernel" of stabilized dunes in the Baclain Jaran Desert perhaps consists of calc-sinters and calcareous cementation layers. Deep-seated groundwater effuses from this "kernel" and recharges to lakes in desert. Precipitation and snowmelt water from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is fed into the Baclain Jaran Desert, Gurinai, Wentougaole and Ejinqi areas through the Xigaze-Langshan Fault zone. The isotopic compositions of groundwater in the Alax Plateau are abnormal due to the strong evaporation of the Gyaring and Ngoring lake water in the headstream of the Yellow River. Groundwater dissolves dissoluble fractions of rocks during its transportation through the fault zone and flows out of the mouth of spring in the Badan Jaran Desert. The dissoluble fractions are finally developed into calc-sinters and calcareous cementation layers around the spring. Calci-sinters are gradually largened and eventually emerge on the surface of lake water. Eolian sands accumulate on the surfaces of calc-sinters and calcareous cementation layers, and eventually develop into dunes. Invasion of magma causes an increase in the temperature of groundwater within the faults. Groundwater evaporation provides water vapor for the formation of humid stabilized dunes during its upwelling. Rhizoconcretions found in Yihejigede indicate that the dune was formed and remained immovable 4700 years ago. The height of the megadunes is proportional to thermal quantity carried by the groundwater.

Heat budget analysis using a circulation model	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL												Ecosystems in deep lakes are vulnerable to mixing regime alterations induced by global warming. Detection of mixing regime shifts contributes to a better understanding of the changes that occur in lake ecosystems due to climate change. In the winter of 2018/2019, the monomictic mixing in Lake Biwa, Japan, was partially incomplete. To identify the determining factor, our study reproduced this interruption in monomictic mixing using a realistic three-dimensional lake circulation model and heat budget analysis. The results revealed that weak surface cooling was primarily caused by a decrease in wind speed during the winter rather than by an increase in the air/water temperature, leading to the weak overturn and interruption in monomictic mixing. The results outlined that the mixing regime in Lake Biwa may be shifting from a monomictic to an oligomictic system because of atmospheric stilling or wind speed reductions affected by global warming.																			0262-6667	2150-3435				DEC 10	2023	68	16					2298	2316		10.1080/02626667.2023.2262455	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2023.2262455		OCT 2023											WOS:001089796800001
J	Leoni, B				Leoni, Barbara			Zooplankton predators and preys: body size and stable isotope to investigate the pelagic food web in a deep lake (Lake Iseo, Northern Italy)	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Seasonal changes in trophic position and food sources of deep subalpine lake (Lake Iseo, Northern Italy) zooplankton taxa were investigated during the year 2011. Furthermore, it is combined carbon and nitrogen Stable Isotope Analysis (SIA) with size-specific analyses of both, the major predatory cladoceran (Leptodora kindtii, Focke) and two potential preys (Daphnia longispina complex and Eubosmina longicornis). SIA studies have been extremely useful to track the energy flow through complex trophic network, however, if it is applied to analyze relation between two/few species may lead to misleading interpretations. In fact, integrating size-specificity allowed for understanding why L. kindtii nitrogen isotopic fingerprint fully overlapped with Daphnia, in spring. By investigating changes in L. kindtii's feeding basket, we found that in spring, L. kindtii mainly relied upon E. longicornis as prey, Daphnia being of too large body size for being captured by L. kindtii. Among preys encountered directly in front by a free-swimming Leptodora, only those able to fit into basket opening can be captured. As basket diameter increases with animal body length, size selection of prey depends on L. kindtii body length. As in other deep, subalpine lakes, E. longicornis was less N-15-enriched than Daphnia, most likely because of exploiting nitrogen fixing, cyanobacteria colonies, commonly detected in Lake Iseo with the onset of thermal stratification. Cyclopoid adults were at the top of zooplankton food chain and they could potentially be feeding on Daphnia. They, however, likely fed in a different habitat (>20 m deep water), as suggested by a rather than negligible carbon fractionation. The results overall suggest that size-specificity is crucial for addressing space and time changes in trophic links between organisms composing the two hierarchical levels within open water zooplankton community.

Using a regenerative farming technology of integrating grass-chicken farming in a winter fallow field, we investigated soil nitrogen conversion and assessed the agricultural economic benefits of the whole farmland ecosystem. To test the effects of chicken grazing on the fallow system, we established field treatments involving adding chickens to a field planted with the cover crops, including cover milk vetch (Astragalus sinicus) with chicken grazing treatment (MC) and cover ryegrass (Lolium spp.) with chicken grazing (RC); cover crops only, including cover milk vetch (Astragalus sinicus) treatment (M) and cover ryegrass (Lolium spp.) (R); and a bare fallow field treatment (CK). We found that both cover crops (M and R) and cover crops with chicken grazing (MC and RC) increased nitrate, ammonium, dissolved organic nitrogen, and total nitrogen contents, and the increase was higher in MC and RC treatments. We also observed increased straw biomass and grain yield in the all four treatments, with more increases with chicken treatments as compared with CK. On the economic profits, MC increased by 101.72% and RC increased by 104.12% as compared with CK, while R increased by 5.19% and M reduced by 1.86% as compared with CK. The nitrogen transfer rate (the output/input ratio) of MC, RC, M, and R increased by 66.71%, 71.50%, 65.97%, and 59.97%, respectively, while the nitrogen accumulation rate (input-output) of MC, RC, M, and R increased by 480.56%, 612.98%, 356.74%, and 267.65%, respectively. Our study demonstrates that retaining nitrogen and gaining economic profit by integrating cover crops with chicken grazing is potentially more sustainable than adding cover crops alone. We further suggest that using the integrated grass-livestock farming technology can reduce environmental damage caused by commercial fertilizers. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

J	Giriatowicz, JP				Giriatowicz, Jozef Piotr			The North Atlantic Oscillation influence on the Odra river estuary hydrological conditions	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												The study focused on the relationships between the North Atlantic Oscillation index and water temperature, number of days with ice, and water level in the Odra river estuaries. Statistically significant relationships occur mainly in the winter period (December-February, DecemberMarch, January-March), even up to alpha = 0.01. The strongest relationships with the NAO index are observed for the water temperature and number of days with ice, mainly in areas with minor water motion (Szczecin Lagoon). The correlation coefficients for water temperature are even > 0.80. Only slightly weaker correlation coefficients apply to the NAO relationships to the number of days with ice, especially in the Odra river (in Widuchowa) and in the Pomeranian Bay (in Migdzyzdroje). The relationships are deteriorated there by the relatively intensive water motion (ice inflow and outflow). During extreme winters (very harsh or very mild) in the Odra river estuary, local factors, mainly the local southern Baltic Sea atmospheric circulation, negatively affect the NAO relationships to the thermal and ice parameters. The weakest relationships to the NAO index apply to the water level; they are characterized by correlation coefficients < 0.60 and weaken inland in the Odra river estuary. During some winters the NAO index relationships to the water level may be distorted by the wind and extreme inflows from the upstream sections of the Odra river. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

It is a shallow (max depth 7.4 m) and small (area 48 ha) reservoir with a wide profundal zone characterized by complete deoxidation in summer. Due to its important natural and social role, the lake has undergone a restoration process. Artificial oxygenation is the main method of improving water quality. Due to unfavorable morphometric conditions, the necessity to use multi-point aeration was assumed. An experimental installation based on eight reactors selectively oxygenating only the over-bottom waters was launched in 2019. In 2021, spatial studies of the effectiveness of aerators' work were carried out at 96 measuring points grouped into 12-test fields around each reactor. The investigations were performed three times during the summer season. It was shown that, in the water of the deepest layers of Lake Lajskie, the oxygen concentration around all reactors increased to an average level of 1-2 mg L-1. The oxygenation efficiency was varied and related to the distance from the aerator and the location in relation to the direction of oxygenated water outflow. The results of the research indicate the legitimacy of designing multi-point oxygenation systems in the restoration of waterbodies degraded as a result of the impact of agriculturally transformed catchments.					; Augustyniak, Renata/AAY-3672-2021	Lopata, Michal/0000-0002-1993-3287; Tandyrak, Renata/0000-0001-6767-6572; Grochowska, Jolanta/0000-0001-7319-4174; Augustyniak-Tunowska, Renata/0000-0003-0098-0427														2076-3417				MAR	2023	13	5							2861	10.3390/app13052861	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app13052861													WOS:000947173600001

Dynamic or mechanistic models and empirical or statistical methods have been used to integrate the physical processes in lakes enabling the response of the thermal structure to changes in air temperature to be determined. Water temperature records for Lake Mendota, WI., are possibly the most extensive for any dimictic lake in the world and allowed both approaches to be used. Results from both techniques suggest the mixed layer temperature increases with increasing air temperature. Results from the empirical approach suggested epilimnion temperatures increase 0.5 to 1.0.degree.C per 1.0.degree.C increase in air temperature compared to 0.4 to 0.85.degree.C estimted from a dynamical model (DYRESM). Increased air temperatures are related to significant warming in deep water temperatures in the absence of stratification; however, mid summer hypolimnion temperatures are expected to change very little or increase only slightly in response to climatic warming. Both approaches suggest increase in air temperatures increase the length of summer stratification; results from the dynamic model suggest an increase of approximately 5 days per 1.degree.C increase in air temperature. Longer stratification is reflected in shallower late summer thermocline depths. With these quantitative relationships and forecast increases in air temperature for the 2 .times. COf2 climatic scenario (Greenhouse Effect) from three General Circulation Models, projections are made describing the changes in the future mean thermal structure of moderate to large sized lakes.

Lawrence			A high-resolution stalagmite record from Luoshui Cave, Central China over the past 23.5 kyr	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												A continuous high-resolution record from a precisely-dated stalagmite spanning the last precessional cycle provides new insight into the dynamics of climate change from orbital to centennial scales. A 600-mm length stalagmite (LS46) collected from the Luoshui Cave, Hubei Province, Central China, was well-dated (a total of 24 Th-230 dates) and high-resolved sampled for oxygen and carbon stable isotopic measurements (2047 subsamples in total). The stalagmite LS46 delta O-18 is consistent with other published stalagmite delta O-18 time series in monsoonal China, and closely tracks changes in the Northern Hemisphere summer insolation (NHSI) on July 21st throughout the past 23.5 kyr. Besides, the stalagmite LS46 delta O-18 shows significant correlations with the reconstructed Dali lake-level history and tree-ring delta O-18 records in the marginal monsoon regions. On this basis, we interpret that the stalagmite LS46 delta O-18 reflects the large-scale monsoon circulation with a superimposed local climate signal that might be related to effective humidity. Furthermore, the stalagmite LS46 delta O-18 exhibited four long-lasting extremely weak monsoon events since 7 kyr B.P.. These four weak monsoon events corresponded well with the tree-ring record in the northwestern fringe of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) region. Notably, the good correspondence between the stalagmite record and the tree-ring record also provides a good chronological support for our assessment of the climate and cultural evolution during the middle-late Holocene transition, the medieval warm period (MWP) and Little Ice Age (LIA). During the early-middle Holocene, the detrended delta O-18 profile revealed 10 multi-centennial monsoon cycles with a duration of nearly 500 yr and the amplitude of similar to 0.8 parts per thousand. The wavelet analysis further discloses that the EASM has nearly 500 yr and 200 yr periodic oscillations in the early-middle Holocene, research indicated that the solar activity and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)/North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) jointly drive the dominant nearly 500 yr cycle of the Asian monsoon.

Reconstructed climate curves rest on the observation that certain plant assemblages or insects only exist above or below known climatic conditions. Proxy data is biased towards the mean annual air, rather than soil temperature. The development of permafrost however, is driven only by the mean annual soil temperature. Monitoring of near surface soil temperatures and temperatures in lakes/rivers in permafrost terrain in the Northern Territories of Canada indicates substantial positive excursions of mean annual near-surface soil temperatures from the corresponding mean annual air temperatures. These differences are caused by the influence of vegetation, the presence of water bodies and, predominantly, snow cover in winter. Attempts to reconstruct the former extent and depth of permafrost in north-central Europe by numerical modelling must therefore include code dealing with heat exchange processes near the soil surface. We present the results of a numerical model which calculates the extent and depth of former permafrost as a function of time for various boundary conditions. In north-central Europe, permafrost depth for a mean annual air temperature may have varied by a factor of up to 2 depending on the near surface conditions. Assuming a barren landscape with little snow cover in winter, leads to a maximum permafrost thickness of about 140 in during the peak of the last cold stage. This is reduced to about 125 in by assuming extensive winter snow cover. The introduction of water bodies (rivers, lakes) into the model suggests that discontinuous permafrost was dominant throughout the Weichselian except perhaps for a short period during the glacial maximum.																					90-5809-582-7				2003							187	191																WOS:000185049300034
J	Pearson, GL; Cassidy, DR				Pearson, GL; Cassidy, DR			Perspectives on the diagnosis, epizootiology, and control of the 1973 duck plague epizootic in wild waterfowl at Lake Andes, South Dakota	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES												An epizootic of duck plague occurred in early 1973 in a population of 163,500 wild waterfowl, primarily mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), wintering on Lake Andes and the nearby Missouri River in southeastern South Dakota (USA). The diagnosis was based on pathologic lesions and confirmed by virus isolation. Control measures included quarantine, attempts to reduce virus contamination of the area, dispersal of waterfowl, and monitoring of wild waterfowl populations for mortality. The epizootic resulted in documented mortality of 18% and estimated mortality of 26% of the waterfowl at risk. Prompt implementation of control measures might have limited mortality to approximately 8%. Losses during the epizootic were equivalent to 0.12% of the annual mortality in the North American 1996 fall population of 80,000,000 wild ducks. The most likely sources of the infection were free-flying wild mallard or American black duck (Anas rubripes) carriers from the upper midwestern or northeastern United States. Duck plague serum neutralization antibodies were demonstrated in 31% of 395 apparently healthy mallards sampled prior to dispersal of the flock at Lake Andes, suggesting that tens of thousands of potential duck plague carriers entered the wild waterfowl populations of all four major flyways. Consequently, the absence of major epizootics of duck plague in wild waterfowl in the subsequent two decades is evidence that substantial numbers of duck plague carriers can occur in wild waterfowl populations without resulting in epizootic mortalities. The failure to isolate duck plague virus from apparently healthy mallards sampled during the epizootic raises questions concerning the validity of conclusions regarding the status of duck plague in wild waterfowl based upon negative results of random surveys conducted in the absence of epizootics.																			0090-3558	1943-3700				OCT	1997	33	4					681	705		10.7589/0090-3558-33.4.681	http://dx.doi.org/10.7589/0090-3558-33.4.681								9391953					WOS:A1997YD64100001

Due to its location near the interface of oceanic and atmospheric systems sourced from Arctic and Atlantic regions, Amsterdamoya is a key site for recording the terrestrial response to marine and atmospheric changes. We employed multi-proxy approaches on lake sediments, integrating physical, biogeochemical, and isotopic analyses to infer past changes in temperature, precipitation, and glacier activity. The results comprise a series of quantitative Holocene-length paleoclimate reconstructions that reveal different aspects of past climate change. Each of the four papers addresses various facets of the Holocene climate history of north-western Svalbard, including a reconstruction of the Annabreen glacier based on the sedimentology of the distal glacier-fed lake Gjoavatnet, a reconstruction of changing hydrologic conditions based on sedimentology and stratigraphy in Lake Hakluytvatnet, reconstruction of summer temperature based on alkenone paleothermometry from lakes Hakluytvatnet and Hajeren, and a hydrogen isotope-based hydrological reconstruction from lake Hakluytvatnet. We also present high-resolution paleomagnetic secular variation data from the same lake, which document important regional magnetic field variations and demonstrate the potential for use in synchronizing Holocene sedimentary records in the Arctic. The paleoclimate picture that emerges is one of early Holocene warmth from ca. 10.5 ka BP interrupted by transient cooling ca. 10-8ka BP, and followed by cooling that mostly manifested as two stepwise events ca. 7 and 4 ka BR. The past 4ka were characterized by dynamic glaciers and summer temperature fluctuations decoupled from the declining summer insolation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The legacy sediment record within the Munroe falls dam pool, Cuyahoga river, summit county, Ohio	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH					Conference of the North-Central Section Meeting of the Geological-Society-of-America	APR 20, 2006	Univ Akron, Akron, OH	Geol Soc Amer	Univ Akron			Dams decrease stream gradient and flow velocity, and often trap a stream's sediment load. For 188 years, sedimentation in the Munroe Falls dam pool on the Cuyahoga River, Ohio created a sediment record of both natural and anthropogenic variability. A wooden dam, first constructed in 1817, was replaced with a 3.66-m-high stone dam in 1902 to better serve local industrial needs. Before this dam was removed in 2005, a coring and transect profiling study was undertaken to characterize the dam pool sediments. To a distance of 600 m upstream of the Munroe Falls Dam, only similar to 30 cm of sediment overlaid the bedrock in the thalweg, indicating that the deep-water channel was an area of sediment transport. However, in the low-velocity shallow-water margins of the dam pool, up to 3 m of organic-rich, clayey silt had accumulated above pre-dam floodplain deposits. Pastflooding events are recorded in these dam pool sediment deposits by an increase in woody debris and sand. A distinctive lithology having an oily sheen, abundant woody debris, and elevated trace metal concentrations occurs at depth throughout the deposits in the shallow-water margins of the dam pool. Pb-210 dating places the top of this layer at approximately 1918. The 1913 flood in northeast Ohio probably deposited this contaminated layer from washed-out upstream sources. A direct relationship between sediment trace metal (Pb, Zn) and magnetic mineral concentrations demonstrates that magnetic parameters can provide rapid pollution assessment of dam pool sediments.																			0380-1330						2007	33				2		127	141		10.3394/0380-1330(2007)33[127:TLSRWT]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3394/0380-1330(2007)33[127:TLSRWT]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000250689200011

The TRANSPEC, which is general to most metal and surface aquatic systems, is constructed by sequentially coupling the speciation/complexation module (in this application MINEQL+) with the fugacity/aquivalence approach for the fate calculations. This model formulation increases the mechanistic detail, predictive power, and fidelity to reality of current fugacity-equivalence fate models for metals by estimating aqueous speciation and complexation, rather than relying on empirically derived partition coefficients. A pseudo-steady state version of TRANSPEC was used to simulate Zn dynamics in Ross Lake (Flip Flon, MB, Canada) that received elevated metal and organic matter inputs for over 50 years. Field studies revealed that ZnS forms soluble ZnL, Zn2+, and ZnSO40 increasing pore water concentrations when surficial sediments turn oxic during fall. The model results for three seasonal scenarios suggest that Zn remobilization is driven by resuspension of insoluble ZnS and the contribution of diffusion is negligible, even during fall when ZnS dissolves to increase the concentration of soluble species under oxic conditions in the sediments. The low diffusive flux is due to the binding of Zn to colloidal dissolved organic matter (DOM) for which sediment-water diffusion is relatively slow, a result that was obtained as a result of considering metal speciation in the fate calculations.

The wilted forage was round baled and then ensiled by wrapping in plastic film. EARLY harvest reduced dry matter (DM) yield significantly as compared to LATE (5.6 vs. 10.5 t ha(-1); P < 0.01). However, forage quality both before and after ensiling was better for EARLY with higher crude protein (CP) and non-structural carbohydrates content and a lower amount of cell walls (NDF). Higher pH and the fermentation characteristics confirmed the poor quality of LATE silage, having higher content of butyrate, propionate and acid detergent insoluble nitrogen and a lower concentration of lactic acid. Dry matter intake of EARLY silage by sheep (average 65.0 +/- 7.3 kg LW) fed solely forage ad libitum was 37% higher than LATE (1386 vs. 1011 g DM day(-1); P < 0.05) due to its better palatability and digestibility. In vivo DM digestibility of EARLY silage was 76.1% while it decreased to 58.2% for LATE silage. Estimated metabolizable energy content of EARLY silage (11.5 MJ kg(-1) DM) was 29% higher than LATE (8.9 MJ kg(-1) DM) resulting as similar to the reference value of a high quality perennial ryegrass silage. The forage conservation system of ensiled round bales is effective and recommended when spring cut Italian ryegrass is harvested at an early stage of maturity.					; Andrighetto, Igino/ABF-4296-2020; Cozzi, Giulio/D-2222-2009	GOTTARDO, FLAVIANA/0000-0002-0427-2180; Cozzi, Giulio/0000-0003-0408-1082													0931-2250					DEC	1997	179	4					251	256		10.1111/j.1439-037X.1997.tb00524.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-037X.1997.tb00524.x													WOS:000071189100008
J	SNUCINS, EJ; SHUTER, BJ				SNUCINS, EJ; SHUTER, BJ			SURVIVAL OF INTRODUCED SMALLMOUTH BASS IN LOW-PH LAKES	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												We measured survival of caged overwintering young-of-the-year and introduced, free-swimming adult smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieui in five Ontario lakes that varied in pH from 4.9 to 5.9 (winter values). No hatchery-reared young survived in lakes that ranged in pH from 4.9 to 5.9 and in total aluminum from 55 to 215-mu-g/L. The only lake in which young survived the winter (2-100% survival) had a pH of 5.9 and a total Al of 34-mu-g/L. Survival of overwintering young in the laboratory was high (92-100%) at all pH levels tested (4.9-6.0). Differences in metal (Al, Cu, Zn, Ni, Mn) concentrations may account for survival differences between the field and laboratory and between lakes with similar pH. Adult smallmouth bass were transferred to four of the same lakes (19-24 fish/lake) used for the experiment on young fish. Population size estimates for the introduced adults were obtained from snorkeling surveys conducted during three spawning seasons (1987-1989). Estimated population size, expressed as a percentage of the number stocked, was highest (41-55%) in the lake with pH 5.9, low (4-12%) in the lake with pH 5.4, and zero in two lakes with pH 4.9-5.2.

A new magnetostratigraphy for the Solent Group is correlated to the chronostratigraphic standard using limited biostratigraphical data, and it is concluded that the base of the Oligocene falls close to the base of the Bembridge Limestone Formation. A long time-series of clay mineral XRD data was generated, which shows striking variation in illitic clay abundance. Illite is interpreted to have formed in gley palaeosols through repeated wetting and drying in response to high seasonality. High illitic clay values are tuned to c. 400 ka eccentricity maxima to develop an age model. In addition to a very strong c. 400 ka signal in the data, spectral analysis of the clay data also confirms the influence of short eccentricity (c. 100ka) and obliquity (c. 40ka) cycles. The succession displays seven conspicuous 10-20m thick sequences, which represent transitions from transgressive estuarine environments through highstand flood-plains to freshwater lakes. The sequences correspond exactly to the long eccentricity (c. 400 ka) cycles. A sea-level curve is derived using the amount of incision as a minimum measure of eustatic fall, but there is no evidence of a major eustatic drop of 30-90 m corresponding to the early Oligocene glaciation of Antarctica. It is likely that incision was suppressed by rapid rates of subsidence.

J	EVANS, MS				EVANS, MS			RECENT MAJOR DECLINES IN ZOOPLANKTON POPULATIONS IN THE INSHORE REGION OF LAKE-MICHIGAN - PROBABLE CAUSES AND IMPLICATIONS	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Summer zooplankton communities in the inshore region of southeastern Lake Michigan were dominated by small species during the 1970s, suggesting that size-selective fish predation pressures were intense. Abundances of alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), the dominant planktivore in the 1970s, declined in recent years, especially over 1982-84. Despite decreased alewife predation, small zooplankton taxa continued to predominate. Moreover, zooplankton standing stocks declined 10-fold during 1982-84, suggesting that predatory pressures had intensified. Concurrent with the alewife population decrease was a major increase in yellow perch (Perca flavescens) abundances. As a probable consequence of intense predation pressures exerted by abundant yellow perch, zooplankton standing stocks were severely reduced. Yellow perch populations may have been adversely affected by food limitation, especially in summer 1984 when zooplankton standing stocks were only 3% of their average level over 1975-81.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				JAN	1986	43	1					154	159		10.1139/f86-017	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f86-017													WOS:A1986AYV4700017

The model was applied to a sediment core from a treeline lake to infer trends in Holocene climate. The record exhibits long-term variations, as well as a series of shorter-term fluctuations on a time scale of centuries. Summers were warmest in the area about 6200 cal yr B.P. and featured distinct cooling episodes around 8300, 7200, 4200, 3000, and 400 cal yr B.P., most of these coinciding with some known climate events (e.g., the 8200 cal yr B.P. event and the Little Ice Age). The similarity of the observed shifts with the pacings of climate events from marine and ice-core records represents evidence for coupled ocean-atmosphere forcing of the regional climate.

An intriguing enigma of Lake Baikal	BIOLOGICAL RHYTHM RESEARCH												The paper presents a solution of the long-lived enigma of Lake Baikal, the so-called "melosira years" phenomenon. Lake Baikal exhibits sharp differences in its spring phytoplankton development of up to hundred times from year to year. Intervals between these bloom outbursts are, as a rule, 3 and 4 years long but they were sometimes doubled, and sometimes they arrived in a year or in other year. An analysis of the "melosira years" sequence enabled us to reveal 3 2/3, 7 1/3, and 11(10, 12)-year cycles in the interannual phytoplankton dynamics and their regulation by solar activity. This regulation is in that algae can skip from cycle to cycle in dependence of the solar activity level in its maximum. When a solar cycle shortens as the 23(rd) solar activity cycle did, spring baikalian phytoplankton also shorten their basic 11-year cycle to 10-year one. The solution is verified by a prediction of future "melosira years".

Before treatment, the limnetic insect assemblages in the study lakes resembled those reported from acidic and/or fishless lakes in Sweden and Canada. Maximum densities of dominant taxa were: Notonectidae; 1.5.cntdot.m-3; Corixidae; 1.1.cntdot.m-3, Graphoderus (Dytiscidae) larvae; 0.27.cntdot.m-3; and Chaoborus americanus; 400.cntdot.m-3. Within 3 mo after treatment, all limnetic populations were near or below the detection limit (0.01.cntdot.m-3). Limnetic densities of notonectids, corixids, and C. americanus were significantly lower (Mann-Whitney U-tests), and benthic densities of Hemiptera and Coleoptera tended to be lower (sign tests) the summer after treatment than the previous summer. Calculated trout predation levels on Hemiptera and C. americanus, and evidence from the literature, strongly suggest that predation was the major cause of reduced limnetic insect populations. The rapid reduction of elimination of these populations indicates considerable instability of the predator-prey relationships of acidic lakes which have been recently limed and stocked with fish.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				FEB	1989	46	2					342	351		10.1139/f89-045	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f89-045													WOS:A1989T286700022
J	Jyväsjärvi, J; Järvinen, M; Hämäläinen, H				Jyvasjarvi, Jussi; Jarvinen, Marko; Hamalainen, Heikki			Spatial community concordance of summer phytoplankton and profundal macroinvertebrates in boreal lakes	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Reliance of profundal benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages on epilimnetic algal production - a key element of pelagic-benthic coupling - is a well-recognized phenomenon in the literature but the details are still poorly understood. In particular, the importance of taxonomic composition of algal communities and associated qualitative aspects of the settling material to benthic invertebrates is poorly known. We addressed this issue by investigating concordance of summer phytoplankton and profundal macroinvertebrate community composition using data from 47 boreal lakes. We examined community variation and environmental correlates of phytoplankton and macroinvertebrates with nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordinations. We also used cluster analysis to group sites according to their macroinvertebrate assemblages and evaluated the differences in phytoplankton composition and class-specific relative abundance among the clusters. Community concordance was evaluated with Procrustes rotation and partial Mantel tests, using oxygen concentration and phytoplankton biomass - the main drivers of macroinvertebrate community structure - as controlling factors. Procrustes and Mantel tests suggested congruence between macroinvertebrate and summer phytoplankton community composition. The concordance remained significant even after controlling for oxygen and biomass, by partial Mantel tests, suggesting a unique effect of phytoplankton species composition on macroinvertebrate assemblages. The four groups of lakes clustered by their macroinvertebrate assemblages also differed significantly in their phytoplankton taxa composition, and there were among-cluster differences in relative abundance of the seven most abundant phytoplankton classes. Our findings of community concordance of phytoplankton and profundal macroinvertebrates suggest a functional dependency of these two components, but further studies are needed to verify the actual causal mechanisms.					; Hämäläinen, Heikki/V-7868-2019	Jarvinen, Marko/0000-0002-8107-8066; Hamalainen, Heikki/0000-0002-6856-1221													0706-652X	1205-7533				DEC	2014	71	12					1776	1783		10.1139/cjfas-2014-0135	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2014-0135													WOS:000344605200003

This study presents the results of high-resolution analyses of Ca and Mg concentrations, Mg/Ca ratio, delta O-18 and delta C-13 values of endogenic calcites from a sediment core from Dali Lake in the EASM margin, in order to investigate the sub-millennial EASM variability and its possible driving forces during the last 6 kyrs. Increases in these chemical proxy data were interpreted as drought events in the region due to the intensive evaporation losses overwhelming the water input to the lake. The chemical proxy data in this study combined with multi-proxy indicators including grain size component and total organic carbon concentrations from the same sediment core imply that declines in the EASM intensity may have played a dominant role in triggering the drought events during the last 6 kyrs. The results indicate that the EASM intensity significantly declined at the intervals of 5.8-4.75, 3.2-2.8, 1.65-1.15 and 0.65-02 kyrs BP. Large declines in the EASM intensity during the last 6 kyrs correspond in time to occurrences of ice-rafted debris in the North Atlantic, indicating that millennial-to-centennial scale changes in the EASM intensity were mainly controlled by climatic processes occurring in the northern high latitudes. These data imply that persistent global warming may be favorable for the strengthening of the EASM circulation and for the transportation of more rainfall to the semi-arid regions of northern China on sub millennial scales.

The carbon (C) exchange between ecosystems and the atmosphere through carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes varies spatially and temporally among these ecosystems. Our study area in Kaamanen in northern Finland covered 7 km(2) of boreal subarctic landscape with upland forest, open peatland, pine bogs, and lakes. We measured the CO2 and CH4 fluxes with eddy covariance and chambers between June 2017 and June 2019 and studied the C flux responses to varying meteorological conditions. The landscape area was an annual CO2 sink of -45 +/- 22 and -33 +/- 23 g C m(-2) and a CH4 source of 3.0 +/- 0.2 and 2.7 +/- 0.2 g Cm-2 during the first and second study years, respectively. The pine forest had the largest contribution to the landscape-level CO2 sink, -126 +/- 21 and -101 +/- 19 g C m(-2), and the fen to the CH4 emissions, 7.8 +/- 0.2 and 6.3 +/- 0.3 g C m(-2), during the first and second study years, respectively. The lakes within the area acted as CO2 and CH4 sources to the atmosphere throughout the measurement period, and a lake located downstream from the fen with organic sediment showed 4-fold fluxes compared to a mineral sediment lake. The annual C balances were affected most by the rainy peak growing season in 2017, the warm summer in 2018, and a heatwave and drought event in July 2018. The rainy period increased ecosystem respiration (ER) in the pine forest due to continuously high soil moisture content, and ER was on a level similar to the following, notably warmer, summer. A corresponding ER response to abundant precipitation was not observed for the fen ecosystem, which is adapted to high water table levels, and thus a higher ER sum was observed during the warm summer 2018. During the heat wave and drought period, similar responses were observed for all terrestrial ecosystems, with decreased gross primary productivity and net CO2 uptake, caused by the unfavourable growing conditions and plant stress due to the soil moisture and vapour pressure deficits. Additionally, the CH(4 )emissions from the fen decreased during and after the drought. However, the timing and duration of drought effects varied between the fen and forest ecosystems, as C fluxes were affected sooner and had a shorter post-drought recovery time in the fen than forest. The differing CO2 flux response to weather variations showed that terrestrial ecosystems can have a contrasting impact on the landscape-level C balance in a changing climate, even if they function similarly most of the time.

Abrupt climate drying at similar to 4.2 ka BP is linked with the beginning of the deurbanization of the ancient Indus Civilization. However, little is known about the climatic conditions of the Ghaggar-Hakra (G-H) river interfluve region that the rural populations of the Indus Civilization inhabited. In this study, we present a high-resolution climate reconstruction of Late Holocene period using lake sediments from Kotla Dahar, located in the G-H interfluve. Our multi-proxy record suggests that the rural Late phase Indus populations declined in the face of weakened summer monsoon rainfall in the Neoglacial period from 3.3 to 2.5 ka BP. Archaeological investigations suggest that this is also the period when the Iron Age Culture established itself in this region. Our geochemical proxies further indicate that the monsoon recovered during the Roman Warm Period (RWP: 2.5- 1.6 ka BP) and the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA: 1.2-0.8 ka BP), which have been previously linked to the northward displacement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone modulated by Atlantic Meridional Oscillations (AMO)-related fluctuations in NH temperatures via its link with the Atlantic Thermohaline Circulation variations and associated interhemispheric heat transport fluctuations.					; Sharma, Rajveer/KFQ-3240-2024; Kumari, Aakanksha/NTR-4857-2025	Kumari, Aakanksha/0009-0008-2468-452X; Dixit, Yama/0000-0002-0700-5918; Sharma, Rajveer/0000-0003-0454-4753; 													0277-3791	1873-457X				MAY 15	2025	356								109309	10.1016/j.quascirev.2025.109309	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2025.109309		MAR 2025											WOS:001450003700001

Trends in the occurrence and risk assessment of antibiotics in shallow lakes in the lower-middle reaches of the Yangtze River basin, China	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												Antibiotics have become a global public concern because of their extensively usage and high toxicity on aquatic organisms, especially leading to the widespread of antibiotic resistance genes. The objective of this study was to evaluate the occurrence, spatial distribution and ecological risks of multi-classes commonly used human and veterinary antibiotics in both aqueous and sedimentary phases of 65 shallow lakes in the lower-middle reaches of the Yangtze River, China. In the target area, antibiotic concentrations in most of lakes (< 20 ng/L in the water of 22 lakes and < 20 ng/g in the sediments of 43 lakes) were generally lower than those documented in previous studies in China and other countries, and these differences were probably due to less pollutant sources, high temperatures and heavy rainfall in summer. The concentrations of antibiotics in water (> 100 ng/L) or sediments (> 100 ng/g) of nine lakes, such as Dianshan Lake, Ge Lake and Ce Lake, were comparable to those in rivers and lakes that were seriously polluted by urban and livestock wastewater in China. The Taihu lakes showed relatively higher antibiotic concentrations, followed by the Huaihe River lakes, Poyang lakes and Dongting lakes. The composition of antibiotics showed that agricultural source might be the main source of antibiotics in most of the lakes in the lower-middle reaches of the Yangtze River basin, China The pseudo distribution coefficient (P-K-d) and significant relationship between antibiotics and environmental factors in the present study suggested the spatial of antibiotics in the lakes might be affected by antibiotics' physiochemical properties and environmental factors. The environmental risk assessment results showed that in general, sulfamethoxazole (SMX), erythromycin (ETM) and ofloxacin (OFX) in the surface water could pose medium risks to algae or bacteria in the aquatic ecosystem, while antibiotics ETM, roxithromycin (RTM), enrofloxacin (EFX) and sulfadiazine (SDZ) in the sediment might pose medium risks to algae or bacteria populations. High potential risk might occur in winter in most lakes due to lower water storage and less degradation. Overall, our study reveals the pollution trends and potential sources of antibiotics in shallow lakes in the lower-middle reaches of the Yangtze River basin.

Attitudes Towards a Transient Carnivore Prior to Recolonization	WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN												Cougars (Puma concolor) have been recolonizing portions of their historic range over the last few decades and are currently a rare, transient species in the western Great Lakes Region. Anticipatory attitude surveys can identify potential management challenges, stakeholder groups, and conservation and educational priorities for recolonizing cougars. We implemented an anticipatory attitude survey to better understand attitudes towards transient cougars in northern Wisconsin, USA. We distributed the survey in fall and early winter of 2014-15 (n = 423) and 2015-16 (n = 594). We compared attitudes towards transient cougars to attitudes towards other established large carnivores and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). We also explored factors that may affect human attitudes towards cougars, such as hunter identity, livestock ownership, risk perception, and the loss of a domestic animal to wildlife. Despite the rare, transient status of cougars in Wisconsin, many respondents (mean of 29%) reported to have observed a cougar or sign of one in the wild in Wisconsin. Cougars had a mean favorability score similar to coyotes (Canis latrans) and wolves (Canis lupus) and less than bobcats (Lynx rufus), bear (Ursus americanus), and white-tailed deer. Comparatively, respondents' risk perception for all categories of risk (i.e., fear for personal safety, the safety of children, and the safety of domestic animals) was higher for cougars than for wolves. Hunter identity and loss of livestock to wildlife were determined by multinomial logistic regression as the most important parameters affecting respondents' favorability towards cougars (omega(i) = 0.71). Using the 2015-2016 survey data, we found that as cougar risk perception increased, favorability towards cougars decreased similarly for both hunters and non-hunters. Hunters were less likely to be favorable towards cougars, more likely to be neutral, and equally likely to be unfavorable towards cougars compared to nonhunters. We identify potential management challenges, stakeholder groups (e.g., hunters and those who have experienced loss of livestock to wildlife), and conservation and educational priorities for recolonizing cougars.

Ethiopia has potential for lithium resources related to pegmatites and to rift-bound brine deposits. The current research focused on known brine lakes and hot springs in the Danakil Depression and the Main Ethiopian Rift. Lithium contents in water samples from rift-bound lakes like Abijata, Shala, Chamo, Abaya, and Chew Bahir show low concentrations consistent with background values for surface waters. Lithium concentrations are elevated in brine lakes, brine ponds, and hot springs of the Danakil Depression. Hot springs in the Dallol contain up to 20 ppm lithium. Lithium enrichment was also noted in residual brines from multi-stage solar evaporation pans during soda-ash production. However, brines produced during precipitation of trona and halite contain about 0.009 ppm lithium, which is well below economically extractable concentrations. Core samples from the Danakil Depression potash exploration reported up to 20-40 ppm in the carnallite and bischofite layers of the evaporite sequence. At least three potential sources for lithium are noted in the Danakil Depression. For example, lithium is leached and mobilized during water rock interactions by deeply circulating and cycling hot meteoric and possibly juvenile geothermal fluids related to the intense volcano-tectonic processes. The current hydrological condition also suggest the possibility of lithium mobilization during surface run off from the basement and Mesozoic sedimentary rocks exposed along the western rift margin of the Danakil Depression. Moreover, variable lithium contents in the different layers of the evaporite sequence suggests, that lithium originated from sea water evaporation before the Danakil Depression became a closed basin. The current research strongly indicates that more detailed investigation is required to evaluate the lithium resources as a primary product and/or as a secondary byproduct during potash mining.																			1464-343X	1879-1956				OCT	2020	170								103904	10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2020.103904	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2020.103904													WOS:000566378200013

Trin. ex Steud., Poaceae) at Lake Constance-Untersee were mown in winter thereby drastically reducing the input of decomposable organic matter (OM) to the sediment. A 4-years monitoring program was started to test whether or not this management influences the hydrochemistry of the bottom water layer, and leads to a decrease in OM, total N and total P in the surface sediment layer. It was found that the sediment/water system of reed beds is well buffered against the removal of the current year's crop of dead Phragmites straw, because (I) the yearly input of dead biomass contributes only 14% to the OM pool of the reedbed, and (II) the decomposition rate of Phragmites litter is very low (c. 0.9 mg g (-1) d.m. d (-1)).																					3-437-25476-6				1997							227	234																WOS:000075264700027

Endangered Cultus Lake sockeye salmon exhibit genomic evidence of hypoxic and thermal stresses while rearing in degrading freshwater lacustrine critical habitat	CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY												Water quality degradation due to lake eutrophication and climate change contributes to the risk of extirpation for the endangered Cultus Lake sockeye salmon. Sockeye salmon juveniles experience both low-oxygen water in profundal lake habitats and elevated temperatures above the thermocline during diel vertical migrations in summer and fall when the lake is thermally stratified. We used a transcriptomic tool (Salmon Fit-Chip) to determine whether salmon were experiencing thermal and/or hypoxic stress during this period. The results showed that over one-third of the fish were responding to either hypoxic (35.5%) or thermal stress (40.9%) during periods when these environmental stressors were pronounced within the lake, but not during periods when profundal dissolved oxygen was elevated and the water column was isothermal and cool. The most consistent signs of hypoxic stress occurred during July (52.2%) and September (44.4%). A total of 25.7% of individual fish sampled during months when both stressors were occurring (July, September, October) showed signatures of both stressors. When a combination of hypoxic and thermal stress biomarkers was applied, 92% of fish showed evidence of one or both stressors; hence, for at least several months of the year, most sockeye salmon juveniles in Cultus Lake are experiencing anthropogenically environmentally induced stress. We also detected the presence of pathogenic ciliate Ichthyoptherius multifiliis in the gill tissue of juveniles, with a higher infection signal in Cultus Lake compared to juveniles from nearby Chilliwack Lake. These data provide powerful new evidence that Cultus Lake sockeye salmon, which experience relatively lower juvenile survival than Chilliwack sockeye salmon, are more compromised by stress and carry a higher level of infection of at least one pathogenic agent. Thus, we hypothesize that the cumulative or synergistic interplay between stressors and diseases, clearly documented to be occurring within Cultus Lake, are contributing to increased mortality of endangered sockeye salmon.						akbarzadeh, arash/0000-0002-2527-4791													2051-1434					NOV 25	2021	9								coab089	10.1093/conphys/coab089	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/conphys/coab089								34858597					WOS:000746845300001

Lake-Effect Snowbands in Baroclinic Environments	WEATHER AND FORECASTING												Lake-effect snowstorms are often observed to manifest as dominant bands, commonly produce heavy localized snowfall, and may extend large distances inland, resulting in hazards and high societal impact. Some studies of dominant bands have documented concomitant environmental baroclinity (i.e., baroclinity occurring at a scale larger than the width of the parent lake), but the interaction of this baroclinity with the inland structure of dominant bands has been largely unexplored. In this study, the thermodynamic environment and thermodynamic and kinematic structure of simulated dominant bands are examined using WRF reanalyses at 3-km horizontal resolution and an innovative technique for selecting the most representative member from the WRF ensemble. Three reanalysis periods are selected from the Ontario Winter Lake-effect Systems (OWLeS) field campaign, encompassing 185 simulation hours, including 155 h in which dominant bands are identified. Environmental baroclinity is commonly observed during dominant-band periods and occurs in both the north-south and east-west directions. Sources of this baroclinity are identified and discussed. In addition, case studies are conducted for simulation hours featuring weak and strong along-band environmental baroclinity, resulting in weak and strong inland extent, respectively. These contrasting cases offer insight into one mechanism by which along-band environmental baroclinity can influence the inland structure and intensity of dominant bands: in the case with strong environmental baroclinity, inland portions of this band formed under weak instability and therefore exhibit slow overturning, enabling advection far inland under strong winds, whereas the nearshore portion forms under strong instability, and the enhanced overturning eventually leads to the demise of the inland portion of the band.																			0882-8156	1520-0434				DEC	2019	34	6					1657	1674		10.1175/WAF-D-18-0191.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/WAF-D-18-0191.1													WOS:000490732500003

Production at the glacially turbid Tustumena Lake and its outlet, the Kasilof River (south central Alaska), was thought to be limited to a single run of sockeye salmon that spawned in the lake's clear-water tributaries. However, up to 40% of the returning sockeye salmon enumerated by sonar as they entered the lake could not be accounted for during lake tributary surveys, which suggested either substantial counting errors or that a large number of fish spawned in the lake itself. Lake shoreline spawning had not been documented in a glacially turbid system. We determined the distribution and pattern of sockeye salmon spawning in the Tustumena Lake system from 1989 to 1991 based on fish collected and radiotagged in the Kasilof River. Spawning areas and times were determined for 324 of 413 sockeye salmon tracked upstream into the lake after release. Of these, 224 fish spawned in tributaries by mid-August and 100 spawned along shoreline areas of the lake during late August. In an additional effort, a distinct late run was discovered that spawned in the Kasilof River at the end of September. Between tributary and shoreline spawners, run and spawning time distributions were significantly different. The number of shoreline spawners was relatively stable and independent of annual escapement levels during the study, which suggests that the shoreline spawning component is distinct and not surplus production from an undifferentiated run. Since Tustumena Lake has been fully deglaciated for only about 2,000 years and is still significantly influenced by glacier meltwater, this diversification of spawning populations is probably a relatively recent and ongoing event.																			0002-8487					JAN	1995	124	1					1	15		10.1577/1548-8659(1995)124<0001:POSSBS>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1995)124<0001:POSSBS>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1995RB06900001
J	Ding, K; Qin, BQ				Ding, Kan; Qin, Boqiang			Global Drivers of Algal Bloom Occurrence: The Role of Climate, Hydrology, and Morphometry	WATER												Lake ecosystems are increasingly threatened by harmful algal blooms (HABs), which are driven by global warming and rising nutrient inputs. Hydrological and morphometrical characteristics can affect a lake's sensitivity to the risk of HABs, with factors such as low mean depth and long water residence time favoring their occurrence. However, the impact of these characteristics on bloom occurrence at large scales has not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we examined the influence of climate, land use, and lake hydro-morphometry on the occurrence of algal blooms in global and regional lakes using a remote-sensing-retrieved global bloom database. Our results indicate significant differences in climate and hydro-morphometric variables between bloom-affected and non-bloom lakes. Logistic regression analyses reveal that climate variables such as precipitation, summer air temperature, summer light, and summer wind speed exhibit significant but regional-specific influence on algal bloom occurrence. While the lake surface area and mean discharge show consistent positive influence across most regions, the influence of elevation, mean depth, shoreline development, and water residence time vary regionally. Random forest analyses further highlight the strong relative importance of hydro-morphometric variables in influencing bloom occurrence. These findings highlight the importance of considering regional climate and lake hydro-morphometrical variables when assessing a lake's sensitivity to eutrophication and HAB risk.

The synthesis is based on multi-proxy records on profile "the mainland (Primorye)-islands (Sakhalin-Kurils)". Main archives are sediments of small lakes and peat bogs that recorded the high-resolution environmental changes. The temporal resolution of reconstructions here is up to 26-40 years. During the cold event of 2800-2600 year BP, the humidity decreased sharply, there were long-term dry seasons without strong floods, and buried soil formed on floodplains. The LIA was wet in the mainland and the Kurils, with frequent strong floods, but was drier in Sakhalin. The cooling was characterized by sharp temperature fluctuations where high moisture conditions alternated with short-term drier periods. The shift in geographical position and intensity of the main centers of atmospheric action caused a paleoclimatic interpretation of these events (Aleutian Low, Siberian and North Pacific Highs, the summer Okhotsk anticyclone and the Far East depression). Changes in the North Pacific oscillations played an important role in the alternation of cold-dry and cold-wet periods. Anomalies in the intensity of El Nino and the monsoon system led to changes in tropical and extratropical cyclone trajectories and cyclogenesis in general.

Because long-term observational data rarely exist, it is very difficult to assess whether meromixis is the result of anthropogenic impacts, climate variability, natural ecosystem development or a combination of these factors. Lake sediment proxy-data may help understand how and why eutrophication and meromixis occurred and disappeared in the past. In this study, we present a novel method and proxy to investigate past episodes of meromixis and, hypolimnetic anoxia recorded in lake sediments. We use high-resolution (70 x 70 mu m/pixel) calibrated hyperspectral imaging of a varved lake sediment core from meromictic Lake Jaczno (north-east Poland), to quantitatively map the spatial distribution of Bacteriopheophytin a (Bphe a) at very high sub-varve (i.e. seasonal) resolution. Bphe a is a bacterial pigment and stable degradation product of Bacteriochlorophyll a (Bchl a), which is produced by anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria (APBs) at the chemocline of meromictic lakes. Using sedimentary Bphe a we infer episodes of meromixis (i.e. long-term hypolimnetic anoxia) and changing mixing conditions (i.e. seasonal temperature, event-based water mixing) for the past ca. 120 years. Absence of meromixis occurred on several occasions. From the beginning of our record in CE 1891 until ca. CE 1918, meromixis was not observed. During this time, green pigments (mainly chlorophyll a [Chl a] and diagenetic products) produced by phototrophic algae were deposited while Bphe a was absent. This suggests that regular lake overturning prevented the formation of a persistent chemocline. Bphe a was identified before CE 1890 (Butz et al. 2015),, but over the studied period 1891-2011, meromixis was established in CE 1918 and generally persisted through modern times. However, short-term interruptions of the chemocline were observed following events of rapid sedimentation (CE 1943, CE 1946, CE 1950) and after a strong,pulse of terrigenous material in CE 1978. These events were able to break up meromixis for a short period. After a few years, the system always turned back to meromixis. After ca. CE 1960, meromixis became particularly persistent. This can be attributed to the increased use of fertilizers (causing eutrophication) and warm summers after CE 1990. While interannual summer temperature variability played a major role in the mixing regime until ca. CE 1920, the climatic influence generally decreased in the following decades as the lake remained persistently in a meromictic state due to eutrophication. However, the climatic fingerprint remained detectable for very warm or cold summers. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Seasonal and Vertical Changes in the Surface Area/Biomass Ratio of Potamogeton lucens L. in a Clear and a Turbid Shallow Lake	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC PLANT MANAGEMENT												To determine the influence of different growth conditions on the architecture of Potamogeton lucens L., we measured several morphological parameters of the plants from May to September 2001 in a clear macrophyte-dominated lake and a turbid phytoplankton-dominated lake in Central Estonia. The main difference between the lakes was the higher summer water transparency in the macrophyte-dominated lake. All size related parameters of P lucens tended to be larger in the macrophyte-dominated lake, but only the total above-ground plant surface area and the surface area of leaves differed significantly (p < 0.05) between lakes. The relationship between surface area (A, in cm(2)) and dry weight (DW, in g) for the measured 25-cm sections of above-ground parts of the plants could be described as: A = 312.9 +/- 9.4 DW + 26.5 +/- 6.8 (+/- standard error) (R-2 = 0.649; n = 607; p < 0.001) Better light conditions in summer and shorter wind fetch in the macrophyte-dominated lake were likely factors stimulating further ramification on the plants in August and a more uniform vertical distribution of plant surfaces in this lake compared to the plankton-dominated lake.

Variations in chlorophyll-a concentration in response to hydrodynamics in a flow-through lake: Remote sensing and modeling studies	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												A convolution neural network (CNN) machine learning algorithm is established for Chlorophyll-a retrieval in Poyang Lake using in-situ Chlorophyll-a concentrations and concurrent satellite image data. For comparison, other machine learning methods, e.g., deep neural network, XGBoost, random forest, gradient boost, decision tree, and linear regression, are also employed, together with two empirical models. Accuracy analysis validates the robustness of the CNN algorithm, with the R2 of 0.97 and the mean absolute errors of 1.74 mu gL-1, and its performance is better than other machine learning and empirical algorithms. The Chl-a in Poyang Lake is derived from Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) images based on the robust CNN algorithm. As a follow-through type, Poyang Lake has abundant hydrodynamics affecting the Chl-a in the lake water. Thus, the Delft3D Flexible Mesh (FM) model is employed in Poyang Lake to simulate the active hydrodynamics with a high spatial reso-lution (-80 m) under the realistic forcing in the period from 1 October 2020 to 15 March 2022. The simulation results reveal that the flow speed is a significant factor modulating the lake Chl-a with a high concentration in summer and a low concentration in winter; the flow speed and water storage exceed the temperature and solar radiance in modulating the Chl-a. The jacking effect of the Yangtze River can slow down the flow speed in the lake's north channel, therefore, augmenting the Chl-a by-20%, favoring phytoplankton blooms in Poyang Lake. The active eddies may significantly affect the lake Chl-a; cyclonic eddies enhance the local Chl-a, and anticy-clonic eddies weaken the Chl-a. A detailed analysis indicates that the Coriolis force plays a vital role in the momentum balance, which may cause the lift (restriction) of bottom nutrients in the cyclonic (anticyclonic) eddy area, increasing (decreasing) the surface nutrient supply. This study uses Poyang Lake as an example to show that such eddies conventionally appearing in a flow-through lake may dramatically affect the ecological environment in the lake water.

Phytoplankton in more N-sufficient areas of the reservoir (downlake in a metalimnetic chlorophyll peak and uplake near the river inflow) maintained lower rates of lipid synthesis, generally .ltoreq. 10% of the total fixed C, throughout the summer. NH4 enrichment of N-deficient phytoplankton inibited photosynthesis and significantly depressed the high lipid synthesis rates; however, NH4 enrichment had no effect on the phytosynthesis or lipid synthesis of N-sufficient phytoplankton. Our results document, for the first time, the occurrence of high lipid synthesis rates associated with the N limitation of natural phytoplankton assemblages. This relationship has previously been observed in laboratory algal culture studies.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				APR	1988	45	4					720	730		10.1139/f88-087	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f88-087													WOS:A1988N150300018

Instead of the weak boiling-point temperature fumaroles of the former lava dome, a vigorously boiling crates spring now discharges >20kg/s of Cl-rich (15000 mg/kg) and sulphur-poor (>200 mg/kg of SO4), almost neutral (pH up to 6.7) water with an istopic composition close to that of subduction-type magmatic water (δD=-15%, δO=+6.5%). This spring, as well as numerous Cl-free boiling springs discharging a mixture of meteoric water with fumarolic condensates, feed the crater lake, which, compared with values in 1983, is now much more diluted (3000 mg/kg of Cl vs 24030 mg/kg), less acidic (pH=2.6 vs 0.56) and contains much lower amounts of S(>200 mg/kg of SO4, vs 3550 mg/kg) with δS-34=0.5-4.2%(=17% in 1983). Agua Caliente thermal waters, on the southeast slope of the volcano, have an outflow rate of approximately 100 kg/s of 71°C Na-Ca-Cl water and are five times more concentrated than before the eruption (B.R. Molina, unpublished data). Relative N-2, Ar and He gas concentrations suggest extensional tectonics for the El Chichon volcanic centre. The 3He/4He and 4He/20Ne ratios in gases from the crater fumaroles (7.3R(a), 2560) and Agua Caliente hot springs (5.3R(a),44) indicate a strong magmatic contribution. However, relative concentrations fo reactive species are typical of equilibrium in a two-phase boiling aquifer. Sulphur and C isotopic data indicate highly reducing conditions within the system, probably associated with the presence of buried vegetation resulting from the 1982 eruption. All Cl-rich waters at El Chichon have a common source. This water has the appearence of a "partially matured" magmatic fluid: condensed magmatic vapour neutralized by interaction with fresh volcaniclastic deposits and depleted in S due to anhydrite precipitation. Shallow ground waters emerging around the volcano from the thick cover of fresh pumice deposits (Red waters) are Ca-SO4-rich and have a negative oxygen isotopic shift, probably due to ongoing formation of clay at low temperatures.

J	Weyhenmeyer, GA				Weyhenmeyer, GA			Synchrony in relationships between the North Atlantic Oscillation and water chemistry among Sweden's largest lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is commonly presented as an easy and reliable index that can be used to study climatic effects on aquatic ecosystems. Here, the NAO winter index (NAO(w)) was applied to determine effects of winter climate changes on 13 water chemical variables measured monthly at 16 sites in Sweden's three largest lakes (Vanern, Vattern, and Malaren). The NAO(w) strongly affected meteorological, physical, and consequently also chemical conditions. Significant relationships were numerous in Sweden's three largest lakes, but they exhibited little agreement among lakes and even across a lake. Synchronous relationships between the NAO(w) and water chemistry among lake sites were restricted to variables closely linked to surface-water temperature (i.e., reactive silica and pH in May). The weaker the association of a lake variable with water temperature, the weaker the mean NAO(w) signal on the variable over the 16 lake sites. The results of this study might facilitate the prediction of lake ecosystem responses to future changes in the weather over a large region.

Long-term monitoring of Mount St. Helens micrometeorology	ECOLOGY												The 1980 volcanic eruption of Mount St. Helens had profound impacts on the geology, hydrology, and ecology of its surrounding landscapes. Consequently, the event provided a unique opportunity to study ecological change over time in relation to abiotic factors. To better assess the role localized environmental conditions play in these larger processes, we have monitored micrometeorological conditions across six disturbance zones on Mount St. Helens created by the eruption. We deployed 823 environmental sensors at 191 sites from 1997 to 2022 to measure the temperature and relative humidity of aquatic (temperature only) and terrestrial habitats in these areas, collecting over 4.2 million measurements in total. Measurements were typically recorded every 30 min from late spring through mid-fall, with the exception being Spirit Lake, where temperatures have been measured hourly on a year-round basis since 2002. These data have been used to address two broad research questions: (1) how small-scale environmental conditions influence patterns of survivorship and/or establishment on Mount St. Helens post-eruption for a range of organisms, including plants, small mammals, birds, amphibians, arthropods, fish, and other aquatic biota, and (2) to quantify and compare these environmental conditions across different disturbance zones, which vary in disturbance type, intensity, and history of post-eruption secondary disturbances. Due to the repeatability of these measurements over many years, these data lend themselves to exploring the relationship between forest succession and microclimate, especially with respect to forest-dwelling organisms whose spread and demography are sensitive to temperature and relative humidity. In addition, this dataset could be used to investigate additional questions related to early succession, disturbance ecology, climate change, or volcano ecology. This dataset is available in the R data package MSHMicroMetR, which also includes an R Shiny data visualization and exploration tool.

These creeks historically provided the most spawning and rearing habitat for endemic Eagle Lake rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss aquilarum. Three-pass electrofishing removal was conducted in 2007-2009 over the entire 2.8-km length of Bogard Spring Creek to determine whether brook trout removal was a feasible restoration tool and to document the life history characteristics of brook trout in a California meadow stream. After the first 2 years of removal, brook trout density and biomass were severely reduced from 15,803 to 1,192 fish/ha and from 277 to 31 kg/ha, respectively. Average removal efficiency was 92-97%, and most of the remaining fish were removed in the third year. The lack of a decrease in age-0 brook trout abundance between 2007 and 2008 after the removal of more than 4,000 adults in 2007 suggests compensatory reproduction of mature fish that survived and higher survival of age-0 fish. However, recruitment was greatly reduced after 2 years of removal and is likely to be even more depressed after the third year of removal assuming that immigration of fish from outside the creek continues to be minimal. Brook trout condition, growth, and fecundity indicated a stunted population at the start of the study, but all three features increased significantly every year, demonstrating compensatory effects. Although highly labor intensive, the use of electrofishing to eradicate brook trout may be feasible in Bogard Spring Creek and similar small streams if removal and monitoring are continued annually and if other control measures (e.g., construction of barriers) are implemented. Our evidence shows that if brook trout control measures continue and if only Eagle Lake rainbow trout are allowed access to the creek, then a self-sustaining population of Eagle Lake rainbow trout can become reestablished.

J	BermanFrank, I; Erez, J				BermanFrank, I; Erez, J			Inorganic carbon pools in the bloom-forming dinoflagellate Peridinium gatunense	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Peridinum gatunense, the main bloom-forming species in Lake Kinneret, acquires a carbon-concentrating mechanism (CCM) during the progression of the annual winter-spring bloom. Previous indications for CCM activity in P. gatunense were based on decreased carbon isotope fractionation and higher activity of carbonic anhydrase (both external and internal). In the present study, CCM activity in low-density, natural, and cultured P. gatunense populations was demonstrated by cells showing higher internal inorganic carbon (C-i) concentrations than those in the external medium. The presence, size, and dynamics of these C-i pools were measured using pulse-chase experiments of C-14 uptake into photosynthetic acid-stable products under varying C-i, pH, CO2(aq), and light regimes. Internal C-i levels in P. gatunense were higher by a factor of similar to 20-80 relative to the ambient C-i. The time required to reach isotopic equilibration of the pool ranged from 30 to 90 min, whereas the time required for the assimilation of the pool into cellular carbon ranged from 10 to 50 min. These long timescales are attributed to the larger vol: surface area ratio of this organism. Induction of the CCM was triggered by CO2(aq) rather than C-i and was evident at CO2(aq) concentrations <15 mu M. Preincubation in either the dark or with high CO2(aq) levels diminished the C-i pool. The data we report represent the steady-state carbon metabolism of the species since the cells were not deprived of C-i prior to the measurements. The CCM in P. gatunense is an important adaptation mechanism contributing to the high primary production observed in the lake at the peak of the bloom under CO2-limiting conditions [pH >9.5 and CO2(aq) <5 mu M].					; Berman-Frank, Ilana/NGR-4939-2025	Berman-Frank, Ilana/0000-0003-3497-1844; 													0024-3590					DEC	1996	41	8					1780	1789		10.4319/lo.1996.41.8.1780	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1996.41.8.1780													WOS:A1996WR06100015

Last Glacial droughts and fire regimes in the central Mexican highlands	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												Over the last glacial cycle, climate variations in the Neotropics were related to diverse forcing mechanisms whose understanding has been limited because of the scarcity of continuous long records. Here we use high-resolution charcoal particle accumulation, inorganic carbon precipitation and magnetic susceptibility data from Lake Chalco, located in high-altitude tropical central Mexico, to assess the fire regimes and drought periods between approximate to 85 and 10.8k cal a BP. Overall, drought intervals were characterized by high carbonate deposition and were contemporary with high spring insolation. Most of the high fire activity periods were coupled with droughts, whereas some of them seem to have responded to volcanic activity in the basin. Periods of more fire activity during the latest part of Marine Isotope Stage 3 were associated with a long interval of higher spring insolation. Increase in drought frequency during 47-27k cal a BP were possibly linked to a more active Laurentide Ice Sheet influencing the oceanic and atmospheric controls of the tropical climatic system. In fact, Chalco and Cariaco records show similar millennial-scale trends, suggesting a role of the Intertropical Convergence Zone in modulating moisture availability in the region.					; P, Dr.Gopinathan/O-2348-2018	Correa-Metrio, Alex/0000-0002-1278-2746; Beramendi-Orosco, Laura E./0000-0002-6790-1378; Roy, Priyadarsi D./0000-0003-3284-8762; Ortega-Guerrero, Beatriz/0000-0002-3823-1926; Caballero, Margarita/0000-0001-5691-0773; Lozano-Garcia, Socorro/0000-0002-3579-175X													0267-8179	1099-1417				JAN	2015	30	1					88	99		10.1002/jqs.2761	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jqs.2761													WOS:000348721100010

Niche overlap indices were used to quantify resource use patterns. Size classes spatially segregated into different habitats, but not different depths within a habitat type. Segregation of sexes at different depths was observed with females occupying warm, shallow areas; males were more common in cool, deep water. Formation of an anoxic hypolimnion restricted perch to the epilimnion in late summer, but patterns of habitat segregation observed prior to thermocline formation were maintained. Food partitioning was relatively unimportant in reducing niche overlap. Spatial segregation of perch size classes and sexes may compensate for high diet overlap between conspecifics and reinforces the importance of habitat partitioning in structuring fish communities.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1984	41	12					1745	1752		10.1139/f84-215	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f84-215													WOS:A1984TV19600004

Status and development of the population of the globally threatened Dalmatian Pelican, Pelecanus crispus, in Turkey	ZOOLOGY IN THE MIDDLE EAST												The Dalmatian Pelican, Pelecanus crispus (Bruch, 1832), used to be a widespread breeding species in Turkey in the past. Until the 1990s, approximately 473-763 pairs were breeding at 20-25 sites. Of these, 53-59% have been lost due to drainage of wetlands, 17-19% due to direct persecution, 16-22% due to both drainage and persecution, and 6-8% due to water level increase. Currently there are only five active breeding colonies: Gediz Delta, Manyas Lake, Buyuk Menderes Delta, Aktas Lake and Isikli Lake. The colony at Isikli Lake was discovered in 2010 and comprises 6 pairs. Since 2000, the total breeding population of Dalmatian Pelicans increased moderately from 220-250 to 277-341 pairs. Likewise, the wintering population has also increased from 352 up to 2,344 individuals, which seems to be linked with the increase in the breeding population in the region. Nevertheless, the population size still renders the species susceptible to the risks affecting small populations.

Microbial AMD communities have been extensively studied for their ability to thrive under extremely acidic conditions and for their immense contribution to the dissolution of metal ores. However, little is known on microbial inhabitants of AMD systems subjected to extremely contrasting continental seasonal temperature patterns as opposed to maritime climate zones, experiencing much weaker annual temperature variations. Here, we investigated three types of AMD sites in Eastern Transbaikalia (Russia). In this region, all surface water bodies undergo a deep and long (up to 6 months) freezing, with seasonal temperatures varying between -33 and +24 degrees C, which starkly contrasts the common well-studied AMD environments. We sampled acidic pit lake (Sherlovaya Gora site) located in the area of a polymetallic deposit, acidic drainage water from Bugdaya gold-molybdenum-tungsten deposit and Ulan-Bulak natural acidic spring. These systems showed the abundance of bacteria-derived reads mostly affiliated with Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria, chloroplasts, Chloroflexi, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes. Furthermore, candidate taxa "Ca. Saccharibacteria" (previously known as TM7), "Ca. Parcubacteria" (OD1) and WPS-2 were represented in substantial quantities (10-20%). Heterotrophy and iron redox cycling can be considered as central processes of carbon and energy flow for majority of detected bacterial taxa. Archaea were detected in low numbers, with Terrestrial Miscellaneous Euryarchaeal Group (TMEG), to be most abundant (3%) in acidic spring Ulan-Bulak. Composition of these communities was found to be typical in comparison to other AMD sites; however, certain groups (as Ignavibacteriae) could be specifically associated with this area. This study provides insight into the microbial diversity patterns in acidic ecosystems formed in areas of polymetallic deposits in extreme continental climate zone with contrasting temperature parameters.

In this study, we investigate local environmental and climatic changes near Kangerlussuaq, west Greenland. Our reconstruction is based on a lake sediment core and methods include chemical proxies and a palynological analysis. The investigated site is located 15 km from the Aasivissuit Inuit summer hunting ground, which has been in use for caribou hunting for more than 2000 years. The presented climatic reconstruction covers the time from c. 560 CE to present time. We identify three distinct periods of climate regimes: From c. 560-1100 CE conditions were stable, warm and humid, and summer temperatures were 1.5-2 degrees C warmer than today. 1100-1600 was a period of cooler and very arid conditions with more sea ice, corresponding to the Neoglacial cooling. In this period, we detect two wildfire events and subsequent temporary caribou abandonment of the area. From 1600 to present we find increasingly warmer conditions with more precipitation and less extensive sea ice cover, gradually approaching today's climate regime in Kangerlussuaq. We review the existing literature regarding the Aasivissuit summer hunting ground, which was first used concurrently with the detected cooling. Despite climatic deterioration, the hunting ground was regularly in use throughout the Neoglacial and onwards, with peak hunting intensity in the early 1700s. The detected wildfires and reindeer abandonment are interpreted to be localized events at the coring site and did not affect the hunting ground. Our findings highlight the resilience of the Inuit hunters to climatic changes as well as the advantages and limitations of local environmental reconstructions.

We developed a Bayesian hierarchical model to assess the relative importance of predictors of summer cyanobacteria abundance, and to test whether the relative importance of each predictor varies by site, using monitoring data from 16 sites in the four major rivers of South Korea. The results suggested that temperature and residence time, but not nutrient levels, are important predictors of summer cyanobacteria abundance in rivers. Although the two predictors were of similar significance across the sites, the residence time was marginally better in accounting for the variation in cyanobacteria abundance. The model with spatial hierarchy demonstrated that temperature played a consistently significant role at all sites, and showed no effect from site-specific factors. In contrast, the importance of residence time varied significantly from site to site. This variation was shown to depend on the trophic state, indicated by the chlorophyll-a and total phosphorus levels. Our results also suggested that the magnitude of weir inflow is a key factor determining the cyanobacteria abundance under baseline conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd, All rights reserved.

However, the spatial distribution of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) attenuation, and the underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood. We carried out a field investigation with 60 sampling sites covering the entire Lake Qiandaohu from November 29 to December 1, 2013, during the weak stratification period to elucidate the spatial pattern and driving mechanisms. The diffuse attenuation coefficient of UVB (K d (313)), UVA (K-d(340)) and PAR (K-d(PAR)) varied from 1.48 to 4.63 m(-1), 1.09 to 3.43 m(-1), and 0.26 to 0.94 m(-1), respectively. The corresponding ranges for the 1% attenuation depths were from 0.10 to 3.11 m, 1.34-4.21 m and 4.87-17.58 m, respectively. Total suspended matter (TSM) concentration was highly significantly correlated with K-d(313), K-d(340) and K-d (PAR) indicating that TSM was the main driver of UVR and PAR attenuation in Lake Qiandaohu in the late autumn and early winter. TSM concentration, K-d(313), K-d(340) and K-d(PAR) had obvious horizontal spatial heterogeneity presenting a decreasing trend from the estuary area to the center area in the lake. These results suggested that the spatial distribution of TSM from the inflow drived the spatial distribution of UVR and PAR attenuation. Significantly positive correlations were also observed between the chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption coefficient and K-d(313). TSM and CDOM absorption spectra showed that in the UVR waveband (350-400 nm), the mean relative contribution rates of CDOM (a(g)(lambda)) , non-algal particles (a(nap)(lambda)), phytoplankton (a(ph)(lambda)) and pure water (a(w)(lambda)) to the total absorption were 67.5 %, 24.0 %, 5.0 % and 3.5 %, respectively. In the PAR waveband, the mean relative contribution rates of a(g)(lambda), a(nap)(lambda), a(ph)(lambda) and a(w)(lambda) to the total absorption were 25.4 %, 18.6 %, 9.4 % and 46.6 %, respectively. Our findings could provide support for ecological environment protection in Lake Qiandaohu considering the importance of UVR and PAR attenuation in aquatic ecosystems.					; Zhang, Yunlin/N-5464-2014; , 张一波/AAY-5453-2020; Zhang, Baoshan/JDW-6031-2023; Shi, Kun/O-2638-2013	Zhang, Yibo/0000-0001-5542-2495; Shi, Kun/0000-0002-6124-7512; Zhang, Yunlin/0000-0002-3382-4570; 													0075-9511	1873-5851				SEP	2020	84								125798	10.1016/j.limno.2020.125798	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.limno.2020.125798													WOS:000579410600008

To determine genetic influence on morphology, we correlated genetic data with morphological data. The study observed significant morphological differences between all studied populations, including three closely related hot spring populations (Bogoria, Chelaba and Turtle Springs), and two populations with similar genetic background inhabiting saline environments in Lake Turkana basin (Turkana and Crocodile Lake populations). In addition, allometric growth patterns of the seven populations differed significantly, demonstrating that developmental changes (plastic or adaptive) operated between these populations. Positive correlation between morphometric and genetic data confirmed the influence of genetic factors on morphology. All observed differences were attributed either to genetic and/or environmental factors, which seemed to play a major role in influencing morphology of wild Nile tilapia populations. We recommend further studies to be carried out under controlled conditions to confirm the role of temperature, pH and salinity in morphological diversification of Nile tilapia.					claude, julien/G-7411-2016; Claude, julien/G-7411-2016; Agnèse, jean-François/J-8302-2016; Agnese, jean-Francois/J-8302-2016	claude, julien/0000-0002-9267-1228; Ndiwa, Titus Chemandwa/0000-0001-5262-6142; Agnese, jean-Francois/0000-0002-6883-551X													0378-1909	1573-5133				MAY	2016	99	5					473	485		10.1007/s10641-016-0492-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-016-0492-y													WOS:000377469200003

The relationship between chlorophyll a (Chl a) and chlorophyll b (Chl b) ratio and the proportion of Chlorophyta within the algae community were analyzed in this study. Results showed that light was more intense in August than in March. Algae density in August was greater than in March. The concentration of Chl a and b was influenced by light intensity level. In March, Microcystis and Kirchneriella sp dominated surface water, where the light intensity was over 216 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), Gloeocapsa, Dictyospaerium pulchellum, and Scenedesmus dominated intermediate water, where the light ranged from 36 to 216 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). Asterionella formosa Hassall and Mougeotia scalaris dominated near the bottom, where the light was below 36 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). In August, Microcystis and Selenastrum reinsch dominated surface water, where the light was above 18 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). Chroococcus, Chlorella, and Scendesmus quadricauda dominated intermediate water, where light ranged from 90 to 180 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). Anabaena spirioides and Pediastrum simplex dominated bottom water, where the light was below 90 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). According to the mean value of Chlorophyta density and algae cell density in three different water levels, the ratio of Chlorophyta and algae community declined from March to August, ranging from 12.35-21.41 to 4.28-11.19 %. The mean value ratio of Chl b and Chl a in three different water levels showed the same tendency from March to August, ranging from 18.05-21.77 to 15.15-17.44 %. These variations in chlorophyll ratio and Chlorophyta ratio indicated that the structure of the algae community structure was influenced by differences in light intensity.

The USGS Great Lakes Science Center (GLSC) began to survey the fall fish community of Lake Michigan in 1962 with bottom trawls. The measurement error was evaluated at the level of individual tows for nine fish species collected in this survey by applying a measurement error regression model to replicated trawl data. It was found that the estimates of measurement-error variance ranged from 0.37 (deepwater sculpin, Myoxocephalus thompsoni) to 1.23 (alewife, Alosa pseudoharengus) on a logarithmic scale corresponding to a coefficient of variation = 66 to 156%. The estimates appeared to increase with the range of temperature occupied by the fish species. This association may be a result of the variability in the fall thermal structure of the lake. The estimates may also be influenced by other factors, such as pelagic behavior and schooling. Measurement error might be reduced by surveying the fish community during other seasons and/or by using additional technologies, such as acoustics. Measurement-error estimates should be considered when interpreting results of assessments that use abundance information from USGS-GLSC surveys of Lake Michigan and could be used if the survey design was altered. This study is the first to report estimates of measurement-error variance associated with this survey.

J	Bukaveckas, PA; Crain, AS				Bukaveckas, PA; Crain, AS			Inter-annual, seasonal and spatial variability in nutrient limitation of phytoplankton production in a river impoundment	HYDROBIOLOGIA												We characterize seasonal and spatial patterns in phytoplankton abundance, production and nutrient limitation in a mesotrophic river impoundment located in the southeastern United States to assess variation arising from inter-annual differences in watershed inputs. Short-term ( 48 h) in situ nutrient addition experiments were conducted between May and October at three sites located along the longitudinal axis of the lake. Nutrient limitation was detected in 12 of the 18 experiments conducted over 2 years. Phytoplankton responded to additions of phosphorus alone although highest chlorophyll concentrations were observed in enclosures receiving combined (P and N) additions. Growth responses were greatest at downstream sites and in late summer suggesting that those populations experience more severe nutrient limitation. Interannual variation in nutrient limitation and primary production corresponded to differences in the timing of hydrologic inputs. Above average rainfall and discharge in late-summer (July-October) of 1996 coincided with higher in-lake nutrient concentrations, increased production, and minimal nutrient limitation. During the same period in 1995, discharge was lower, nutrient concentrations were lower, and nutrient limitation of phytoplankton production was more pronounced. Our results suggest that nutrient limitation is common in this river impoundment but that modest inter-annual variability in the timing of hydrologic inputs can substantially influence seasonal and spatial patterns.

In the present study, we use the General Lake Model to simulate water temperature changes in Nam Co, the second largest lake on the central TP, for the period 1979-2012. The calibration and validation results demonstrate that this model is well suited for thermal simulation of Nam Co. The simulation results indicate that Nam Co has responded to the recent warming climate. The average summer surface water temperature fluctuated yearly, but its trend is positive at a rate of 0.52 +/- 0.25 degrees C per decade. At the same time, the onset of summer stratification advanced by 4.20 +/- 2.02d per decade, and the duration increased at a rate of 6.00 +/- 3.54d per decade. To explore the roles of air temperature and longwave radiation in lake warming, three sensitivity experiments are conducted by removing long-term trends from time series of air temperature and longwave radiation in the forcing data. These experiments prove that both increased air temperature and downward longwave radiation are two driving factors responsible for the warming of Nam Co.

Palsa height was measured, and also the proportion of abraded surfaces and collapsed edges. Active layer thickness ranged from 29 to 74 cm. Statistical analysis showed that the active layer thickness correlated with the height of palsas, with their degree of erosion and collapse. The active layer was thickest on lichen-covered surfaces (mean 59 cm) and thinnest under Betula nana (mean 51 cm). A surprising result was that the bare peat surfaces (mean active layer thickness 52 cm) did not increase the thawing of the active layer. These observations are in clear disagreement with the vegetation change hypothesis proposed by Railton and Sparling (1973) according to which palsa formation depends on changes in surface albedo. Many of the studied palsas are strongly eroded but four new palsas (60-80 cm in height) were also found on the same mires. The present development stage of the palsas shows that winter wind activity is becoming stronger, causing surface abrasion and forming new palsas. In winter 1998-1999 the former active layer on some palsas had not frozen totally. An unfrozen layer was observed between the permafrost layer and the thawing seasonal frost layer.																					90-5809-582-7				2003							995	1000																WOS:000185049300174

The highest annual concentrations of HMs (80.7 ng m-3) were observed in the northeastern TP (Qinghai Lake), while the highest annual concentration of EC (1.9 mu g m-3) was found in the southwestern TP (Ngari). Mn and As were major contributors to the Hazard Quotient (HQ) and the incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR). Peak HQ and ILCR values were observed during the winter seasons. The HI (Hazard Index) of HMs for children exceeded safety thresholds. Health risk assessments for EC indicated no significant non-carcinogenic risk (non-CR) but significant carcinogenic risk (CR) effects in the TP. Higher risks of HMs were found during the dust-rich period (DRP) compared to the normal period (NOP), while EC posed lower health risks during the DRP. Based on dual carbon isotope analyses, the source-specific contributions of EC to health risks were attributed to biomass burning (30.4 %), coal combustion (28.7 %), and liquid fossil fuel combustion (41.0 %), respectively. These findings improved our understanding of the health effects associated with dust exposure and the source-specific health risks of EC in the remote areas.

Invertebrate biodiversity in cold groundwater fissures in Iceland	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Iceland has an abundance of fissures that are parallel to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge where bedrock cracks as a result of continental rifting. Some fissures penetrate the aquifer and expose the groundwater within the bedrock, becoming springs. As such, groundwater fissures have uniform and constant physical and chemical environment but they can differ greatly in morphology. In addition, there is often great variation in depth within fissures and substrate types contrast between vertical rock wall and more heterogenous horizontal bottom. The variation in morphological environment may create dissimilar habitats with unique characteristics and/or influence distribution of resources. Our objective was to study macrozoobenthos communities in cold groundwater fissures in Iceland in relation to physical habitat by comparing invertebrate diversity and density both between fissures with different morphological characteristics as well as between substrate types and depths within fissures. Samples were collected in two fissures in SW Iceland, Silfra and Flosagja. Assemblages were similar between fissures except for higher densities of cladocerans in Flosagja fissure. Within fissures, there was significant difference in Shannon diversity between substrate types in Flosagja, and ostracods were found in significantly higher densities on the bottom. The distribution of all other taxa groups was homogenous in both fissures regardless of depth gradient and substrate. Invertebrates were found to be living within and around a biofilm that covered the entire substrate. These biofilm mats are made from Cyanobacteria and benthic diatoms, which are successful under low light conditions and may minimize any effect of the heterogeneous habitat creating a uniform and suitable microhabitat for invertebrates regardless of depth and substrate type.					; Kristjánsson, Bjarni/B-4349-2013	Kristjansson, Bjarni K./0000-0001-6984-5771; Olafsdottir, Jonina/0000-0002-0813-9213; 													2045-7758					JUN	2019	9	11					6399	6409		10.1002/ece3.5213	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.5213								31236230					WOS:000472622400021

All monitoring sites along the study period go through seasonal phases of cooling, attenuation, insulation, fusion and zero curtain during winter, although thermal equilibrium is only reached at some stations located at lower elevations on Livingston Island. GST evolution at these stations and the duration of snow periods show oscillations, with turning points in the years 2014 and 2015, when temperatures were at their minimum and snow durations were at their maximum, in agreement with the cooling period occurring in the north-western AP in the early twenty-first century. The thermal regime is mainly controlled by snow cover and its onset and offset dates based only on descriptive patterns, not on statistical testing, more than by altitudinal, topographical, geological or geomorphological factors.

Late Pleistocene glaciation in the Central Andes:: Temperature versus humidity control -: A case study from the eastern Bolivian Andes (17°S) and regional synthesis	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												A glacier-climate model was used to calculate climatic conditions in a test site on the east Andean slope around Cochabamba (17 degrees S, Bolivia) for the time of the maximum Late Pleistocene glaciation. Results suggest a massive temperature reduction of about -6.4 degrees C (+ 1.4/-1.3 degrees C), combined with annual precipitation rates of about 1100 mm (+570 mm/-280 mm). This implies no major change in annual precipitation compared with today. Summer precipitation was the source for the humidity in the past, as is the case today. This climate scenario argues for a maximum advance of the paleo-glaciers in the eastern cordillera during the global Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 20 ka BP), which is confirmed by exposure age dates. In a synthesized view over the central Andes, the results point to an increased summer precipitation-driven Late Glacial (15-10 ka BP) maximum advance in the western part of the Altiplano (18 degrees S-23 degrees S), a temperature-driven maximum advance during full glacial times (LGM) in the eastern cordillera, and a pre- and post-LGM (32 ka BP/14 ka BP) maximum advance around 30 S related to increased precipitation and reduced temperature on the western slope of the Andes. The results indicate the importance of understanding the seasonality and details of the mass balance-climate interaction in order to disentangle drivers for the observed regionally asynchronous past glaciations in the central Andes.

Proglacial lakes: character, behaviour and geological importance	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Proglacial lakes are ubiquitous within the Quaternary record and can provide exceptional breadth and depth of palaeoenvironmental information. Present deglaciation is increasing the number and size of proglacial lakes around the world. This study provides a synthesis of knowledge on proglacial lake character and behaviour and critically evaluates the importance of proglacial lakes from a geological perspective. We show how 'ice-marginal' or 'ice-contact' lakes and other distal proglacial lakes can be distinguished from each other by geomorphological, sedimentological, chemical and biological characteristics. The key controls on proglacial lake geomorphology and sedimentology are outlined and discussed. Proglacial lakes can exacerbate mountain glacier and ice sheet margin ablation via mechanical and thermal stresses, but very large lakes can moderate summer air temperatures and relatively retard summer ice ablation. Proglacial lakes interrupt meltwater flux and are very efficient sediment traps. Hydrological routing and consequent geomorphological activity can be radically modified by sudden drainage of proglacial lakes and resultant glacial lake outburst floods; exceptionally large proglacial lake drainages affected global ocean circulation and global climate during the Quaternary. Overall, analyses of proglacial lakes can provide a valuable insight into (i) patterns, character and behaviour of mountain glaciers, ice sheets and glaciations, and (ii) the impacts of past, present and future deglaciation.

It is surrounded by a shrubby grassland which grades into a mixed conifer and deciduous woodland. A record based on pollen, microcharcoal and geochemistry has been used to reconstruct an environmental history covering the last approximately 40 kyr BP. The site was wooded throughout the entire record and there were two relatively warm periods; during Marine Isotope 3 (MIS 3) and for the Holocene from about 9 kyr BP. From 27 to 18 kyr BP a gradual cooling occurred and the coldest part of the record was between 22 and 18 kyr BP when a mixed conifer cool temperate deciduous forest occurred, The warmest part of the record lasted from about 9 to 1.5 kyr BP when mixed evergreen and deciduous forest occurred. The broad pattern of changes is in accord with pollen records from Dajiuhu in Hubei, and demonstrates that this was a regional signal. A moist central China at Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) shows that the East Asian Summer Monsoon was delivering enough moisture on the mainland to sustain forest cover, even at 2120 m asl. The large-scale changes are interpreted as relating to changes in Earth's orbital parameters and sea-level changes in the South China Sea which had an impact on moisture delivery into central China. It is surmised that the westerlies which created dry climates in northeastern China trapped the summer Monsoon influence enough to keep central China moist. The Younger Dryas (YD) is present in the weathering parameters as evident in several changes in elemental abundance delivered to the sediments. The Congping record shows no clear evidence of human impact on its vegetation, and there were no local fires to have caused any vegetation changes. In the last 1.5 kyr BP a slight cooling caused a rise in conifers, a decline in broad-leaved tree taxa and increased weathering rates.																			0031-0182	1872-616X				JUL 1	2021	573								110441	10.1016/j.palaeo.2021.110441	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2021.110441		MAY 2021											WOS:000656517500005

The hydrological characteristics of a stream within an integrated framework of lake-stream connectivity in the Lac de Gras Watershed, Northwest Territories, Canada	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING												Lake-stream networks dominate much of northern Canada. This study explores the hydrological characteristics of an outlet stream from a headwater lake in the Northwest Territories of Canada. Flow hydrographs indicated that stream flow was maximal in most of the cross sections during the first week of July, and subsequently declined to zero by the first week of August 2009 and last week of August 2010. Water balance analysis indicated that the lake can be recharged by runoff from the catchment, but summer evaporation, combined with groundwater loss, caused draw down of lake level below the outflow threshold. Summer rainfall in this semi-arid environment was insufficient to overcome storage deficits to re-establish flow connectivity between lakes. The suitability of the stream sections were assessed for small and large young-of-the-year Arctic grayling based on stream geometry, stream flow characteristics, stream water temperature, and stream water quality.

However, clarifying the timescale of these catastrophic hazardous events is essential for understanding associated eruption dynamics and links with the eruptible portions of the underlying magma system. Case studies addressing the time scale of caldera-forming eruptions are reviewed. Three Quaternary large volume caldera-forming eruption deposits from Yellowstone (US), Taupo (New Zealand) and Kutcharo (Japan) volcanoes are inferred from deposits to have lasted for periods of at least for months to years. However, these estimations are generally based on geological evidence, such as re-worked deposits between eruption units, and not quantitative evidence. Proposed here is a new method of timescale estimation based on paleomagnetic secular variation. A sampling procedure was developed for accurate oriented samples of pyroclastic deposits including volcanic ash. This procedure makes it possible to obtain the mean remanent magnetization of a tephra layer with a 95% confidence limit of about 2 degrees, which is comparable to those of well-determined directions for lava. Based on this procedure, the 7.3 ka Kikai caldera-forming eruption was investigated as a trial. Samples for paleomagnetic measurement were collected from the basal ash-rich part of the lowermost plinian pumice fall (Koya pumice fall) at Satsuma Iwo-jima, Kyushu. The difference of 6.9 degrees in the remanent magnetizations between Koya pumice and reported data of the uppermost co-ignimbrite ash-fall(Kikai. Akahoya Ash) suggests the caldera-forming eruption of a considerable duration (>50 years) on the basis of average rate of secular variation. Paleomagnetic directions from pyroclastic deposits could be a powerful tool for estimating timescales of large explosive eruptions.

J	ELLIOTT, JM				ELLIOTT, JM			MECHANISMS RESPONSIBLE FOR POPULATION REGULATION IN YOUNG MIGRATORY TROUT, SALMO-TRUTTA .I. THE CRITICAL TIME FOR SURVIVAL	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												A 22-year study (1967-88) of migratory trout, Salmo trutta L., in Black Brows Beck (English Lake District [UK]) showed that population density is regulated chiefly by density-dependent survival in the early life-stages. Sampling in 8 years was more frequent than in the long-term study and these samples provide the information used in the present investigation. In the long-term study, survival appeared to be negatively density-dependent in the first spring and positively density-dependent in the first summer of the life cycle, but the more frequent sampling revealed that this puzzling reversal was simply the result of infrequent sampling. The more frequent samples showed that there was a critical survival time (CT days after fry emergence) that varied between year-classes (range 33-70 days) and was inversely density-dependent on egg density; survivor density and loss-rates were strongly density-dependent on egg density before CT, but proportionate survival with stable loss-rates occurred after CT. The sample variance (s2) to mean (.hivin.x) relationship for the frequent samples followed Taylor''s Power Function as in the long-term study. Although the spatial distribution of the young trout was density-dependent with a constant relative level of dispersion, it changed from a slightly clumped pattern before CT (s2 > .hivin.x) to a random or regular pattern after CT (s2.ltoreq. .hivin.x). Territorial behaviour was evident before and after CT, but trout without territories decreased from a high number before CT to negligible numbers after CT. One important mechanism regulating the trout population is therefore the time taken to reach a critical point in the early stages of the life cycle, namely the critical survival time (CT). A new model for population regulation, incorporating CT, was developed and shown to be related to the dome-shaped, stock-recruitment model (Ricker curve) used in the long-term study.																			0021-8790	1365-2656				OCT	1989	58	3					987	1001		10.2307/5137	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/5137													WOS:A1989AT78700017

Detection and variability of combustion-derived vapor in an urban basin	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												Water emitted during combustion may comprise a significant portion of ambient humidity ( > 10 %) in urban areas, where combustion emissions are strongly focused in space and time. Stable water vapor isotopes can be used to apportion measured humidity values between atmospherically transported and combustion-derived water vapor, as combustion-derived vapor possesses an unusually negative deuterium excess value (d-excess, d = delta H-2 - 8 delta O-18). We investigated the relationship between the d-excess of atmospheric vapor, ambient CO2 concentrations, and atmospheric stability across four winters in Salt Lake City, Utah. We found a robust inverse relationship between CO2 excess above background and d-excess on sub-diurnal to seasonal timescales, which was most prominent during periods of strong atmospheric stability that occur during Salt Lake City winter. Using a Keeling-style mixing model approach, and assuming a molar ratio of H2O to CO2 in emissions of 1.5, we estimated the d-excess of combustion-derived vapor in Salt Lake City to be -179 +/- 17 %o, consistent with the upper limit of theoretical estimates. Based on this estimate, we calculate that vapor from fossil fuel combustion often represents 5-10 % of total urban humidity, with a maximum estimate of 16.7 %, consistent with prior estimates for Salt Lake City. Moreover, our analysis highlights that changes in the observed d-excess during periods of high atmospheric stability cannot be explained without a vapor source possessing a strongly negative d-excess value. Further refinements in this humidity apportionment method, most notably empirical validation of the d-excess of combustion vapor or improvements in the estimation of the background d-excess value in the absence of combustion, can yield more certain estimates of the impacts of fossil fuel combustion on urban humidity and meteorology.					; Ehleringer, James/G-1780-2010; Fiorella, Richard/C-1199-2013; Bowen, Gabriel/C-1708-2008	Ehleringer, James/0000-0003-2050-3636; Fiorella, Richard/0000-0002-0824-4777; Bowen, Gabriel/0000-0002-6928-3104; Lin, John/0000-0003-2794-184X; 													1680-7316	1680-7324				JUN 18	2018	18	12					8529	8547		10.5194/acp-18-8529-2018	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-8529-2018													WOS:000435484300004

W.; Cherubini, Paolo			First detection of glacial meltwater signature in tree-ring 18O: Reconstructing past major glacier runoff events at Lago Verde (Miage Glacier, Italy)	BOREAS												With the aim of evaluating the influence of glacial meltwater signature on tree-ring stable isotopes, we analysed 18O and 13C in the tree rings of Larix deciduaMill. specimens growing in the area of an ice-contact lake (Lago Verde, at Miage Glacier, European Alps). Additionally, we analysed 18O in the glacial meltwater of the lake and of the glacier stream and compared it with the 18O of precipitation predicted by a spatial model. We found that tree-ring cellulose of trees fed by glacial meltwaters (LVW site) is significantly more depleted in 18O than at a control site LVM (-0.91 parts per thousand) fed only by precipitation, thus reflecting the measured higher depletion of glacial meltwaters with respect to local precipitation. 13C values did not show significant differences in mean values between the two sites but an anomalous correlation with summer temperature was found at the LVW site, probably due to the different responses of trees stomatal conductance. Over the 30-year period of analysis, four years at LVW (1992, 1995, 2003 and 2009) were markedly depleted in 18O. These years are those when the highest summer temperatures were recorded in the area (the ones during which glacier ablation usually increases and more depleted meltwaters fill the lake), with the exception of 1995 during which high water levels occurred following the year with the second highest summer temperature (1994). Overall, our analysis demonstrates that tree-ring 18O, driven by the glacial meltwater signature in the lake, can be used for detecting past major glacier runoff events. The proposed approach could also be used for quantifying past glacier runoff and for defining past distribution areas of glacial meltwaters in glacier forefields, thus contributing to past environmental reconstructions and to hazard assessment.

J	Tartarotti, B; Sommaruga, R				Tartarotti, Barbara; Sommaruga, Ruben			Seasonal and ontogenetic changes of mycosporine-like amino acids in planktonic organisms from an alpine lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We studied the quantitative and qualitative mycosporine-like amino acid (MAA) composition in phytoplankton and the copepod Cyclops abyssorum tatricus from an alpine lake over a 15-month period. Up to eight MAAs were identified in the samples, with shinorine being predominant. The MAAS occurred year round and showed a strong seasonal pattern. Compared with ice-cover periods, concentrations during the summer were on average 3.6 and 3.0 times higher in phytoplankton and C. abyssorum tatricus, respectively. During the summer, the contents of MAAS in phytoplankton decreased with depth, suggesting their photoprotective role. Chlorophyll a-specific concentrations of MAAS in phytoplankton correlated significantly with the incident solar radiation and ultraviolet (UV) water transparency (r(2) <= 0.36), however, the strongest relationship was found with water temperature (r(2) = 0.67). In zooplankton, highest contents of MAAS were found in eggs, nauplii, and young copepodids, presumably providing a high level of photoprotection for progeny. Proportions of the dominant MAAS in the copepod showed seasonal and ontogenctic variations, which were consistent with relative changes in the predominant MAA, but not other abundant MAAS, in phytoplankton. Considering a time lag of approximately I month between the synthesis and subsequent accumulation of these compounds, MAA concentrations in late copepodid to adult life stages were significantly correlated to those in phytoplankton. Annual patterns in MAAs with high concentrations during periods of elevated environmental stress are consistent with the idea that these compounds play an important role in protecting aquatic organisms against UV damage.					; Sommaruga, Ruben/E-5335-2011	Tartarotti, Barbara/0000-0002-7171-0216; Sommaruga, Ruben/0000-0002-1055-2461													0024-3590	1939-5590				MAY	2006	51	3					1530	1541		10.4319/lo.2006.51.3.1530	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2006.51.3.1530								21258624					WOS:000237748300029

Temperature and productivity influences on U37K' and their possible relation to solar forcing of the Mediterranean winter	GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS												To assess the extent and nature of human-induced climate change, we need to understand natural climate variability. This heavily relies on proxy-based climate reconstructions, calling for excellent understanding of the conditions represented by the proxies. Here we report on an alkenone-based (U-37(K')) sea surface temperature (SST) proxy record originating from south Italian marine sediments, and covering 1305 A. D. to 1979 A. D. with a 3.87 year resolution. The shallow-water cores, extracted from the Gallipoli terrace in the Gulf of Taranto, were dated by the Torino group with high accuracy over the last two millennia, using radiometric and tephroanalysis methods. On the basis of comparison with historical and satellite-derived climate and productivity data, we propose that U-37(K') reflects mainly SST of the cooler part of the year and is modified by variation in magnitude and timing of peak alkenone production on the seasonal temperature cycle. Comparison of the U-37(K') record with the record of atmospheric Delta C-14, a proxy for solar energy variability, shows a high correlation (r = -0.73) for the period between 1420 A. D. and before human interference with the Delta C-14 record by combustion of fossil carbon and the release of radioactive isotopes by nuclear tests. This suggests a centennial-scale solar forcing. We propose that wind-induced mixing resulting from Mediterranean climate dynamics plays a crucial role in translating solar activity to alkenone productivity and SST during the cooler part of the year.					de Leeuw, Jan/F-6471-2011; Versteegh, Gerard J.M./H-2119-2011; Versteegh, Gerardus/H-2119-2011	Taricco, Carla/0000-0002-0129-5539; Versteegh, Gerard J.M./0000-0002-9320-3776; 													1525-2027					SEP 18	2007	8								9	10.1029/2006GC001543	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2006GC001543													WOS:000249683100002
J	Wilson, CE; Darbyshire, SJ; Jones, R				Wilson, Claire E.; Darbyshire, Stephen J.; Jones, Rosita			The biology of invasive alien plants in canada.: 7.: Cabomba caroliniana A.!Gray	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCE												The freshwater aquatic plant Cabomba caroliniana, or fanwort, was recently reported in a lake northeast of Peterborough, Ontario, where it has successfully established and survived winter conditions since at least 1991. This is the first documented occurrence of fanwort becoming naturalized in Canada. Fanwort is a popular aquarium plant that is native to South America and possibly the southeastern United States and has been introduced in several Asian, Pacific and European countries through the discarding or deliberate planting of aquarium plants in natural waterways. It is particularly invasive in China, Japan and Australia, and in parts of the United States, where its range is spreading. Fanwort grows rapidly and forms dense stands that clog waterways, impeding flow, obstructing navigation, altering fish habitat and excluding other vegetation. It does not produce mature seed in the northern parts of its North American range, but can multiply clonally and spread quickly by stem fragmentation. It produces turion-like stems at the end of the growing season, which assist in over-wintering under adverse conditions. Fanwort is difficult to control with herbicides and is resistant to mechanical management techniques as populations can quickly re-establish from plant fragments. Populations near the Trent-Severn Waterway in Canada are extensively established and management tools are not available to attempt eradication. An integrated management plan that focuses on early detection and rapid response in surrounding water bodies may succeed in mitigating the economic and environmental impacts and limiting the spread of fanwort.																			0008-4220	1918-1833				JUL	2007	87	3					615	638		10.4141/P06-068	http://dx.doi.org/10.4141/P06-068													WOS:000249488300039

The influence of an allochthonous input, restricted to the western basin, was clearly traced by higher organic C and total N and P contents, higher delta(13)C values, and higher sedimentation rate in comparison to the eastern basin. The low delta(13)C values of sedimentary organic matter in the major part of the lake, lower than the delta(13)C values of different types of organic matter, suggest that this sedimentary organic matter is most probably the product of a microbial community and not a residue of primary production. The temporal variation of benthic diffusive fluxes of NH4, Si and PO4, derived from modelling the pore water profiles, was related to sedimentation of phytoplanktonic blooms, while the PO4 fluxes were also dependent on changing redox conditions at the sediment-water interface in the period of the winter-spring overturn. The removal of PO4 in pore waters is probably due to the adsorption of phosphate and precipitation of apatite and vivianite. The budget of C, N and P at the sediment-water interface revealed a high recycling efficiency (>70%), also confirmed by the rather uniform (or only slightly decreasing) vertical profiles of organic C, total N and P in sediment cores and C/N and C/P ratios. The percentage of biogenic Si recycling is low (<10%), suggesting its removal in sediments.

Environmental Engineering Interventions To Control The Expansion Of Salty Lakes And Marshes In Siwa Oasis	JOURNAL OF THE EGYPTIAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION												Background: The main activity in Siwa Oasis sodety is the apiculture, it depends on the groundwater. The agricultural drainage water and the unused saline water of lit-aurally flowing sprims are pointed into four main salty lakes. This leads to an increase in the surface area of the saltwater lakes, inamhes and rise in-water table levels. Aim: to investigate some envirorimental engineering intrven hints to control Me expansion of saltwater surface area in Shea Oasis. Mated al and Methods: Field visits, brat-Tabun sheets and survey wi th farmers were carried out to find out the main emironmental pioblems in the Oasis. Environmental survey was carried out to collect different rocks and stones samples as natural construction materials from the desert that surrounds Siwa Oasis. Physical analyses, chemical composition and principal medianicat paranwters were conducted on the collected samples. Results: After the analysis, the safe rocks-were the best natural construction materials in the Siwa Oasis, So, it could be used to build constraction wall around Me salty lakes and marshes. Walls could convert the lakes into batisins. Fhe waMr will be evaporated at high rate during summer season by solar energy, After evaporation, the remaining salty rock named karsher can be easily collecMd from the lakes to be used as a low Hist construction material for traditional building houms in Siwa Oasis. Therefore, the water level of lakes will be reduced to dryness and land could be reused as agricultural land. Conclusion and Recomanendadons: Among different rocks, safe rocks proved to be hie best natural construction materials to construct a Odense wall around It lakes and marshes They will save about 80ffii of the erararete cost The formed karshef rocks from the lakes will be used in the construction of the traditional building houses which will save about 90% of the concrete bin dings This intervention will save energy as it exchanges fuel consuming man-made material such as cement with naturally made material. This can reduce the green house gases generated from the cement industry. Economical feasibility study should be carried out to estimate the capital cost for the retairang wall.

Anders			Migration confers survival benefits against avian predators for partially migratory freshwater fish	BIOLOGY LETTERS												The importance of predation risk in shaping patterns of animal migration is not well studied, mostly owing to difficulties in accurately quantifying predation risk for migratory versus resident individuals. Here, we present data from an extensive field study, which shows that migration in a freshwater fish (roach, Rutilus rutilus) that commonly migrates from lakes to streams during winter confers a significant survival benefit with respect to bird (cormorant, Phalacrocorax carbo spp.) predation. We tagged over 2000 individual fish in two Scandinavian lakes over 4 years and monitored migratory behaviour using passive telemetry. Next, we calculated the predation vulnerability of fish with differing migration strategies, by recovering data from passive integrated transponder tags of fish eaten by cormorants at communal roosts close to the lakes. We show that fish can reduce their predation risk from cormorants by migrating into streams, and that probability of being preyed upon by cormorants is positively related to the time individuals spend in the lake during winter. Our data add to the growing body of evidence that highlights the importance of predation for migratory dynamics, and, to our knowledge, is one of the first studies to directly quantify a predator avoidance benefit to migrants in the field.

This study assessed the trophic niche utilized by an invasive population of the Australian redclaw crayfish, Cherax quadricarinatus, in the Inkomati River Basin, South Africa. It evaluated the hypothesis that the euryphagous feeding strategy of redclaw crayfish may allow it to shift its niche width and niche position by altering its feeding strategy in response to fluctuations in resource availability. Gut content and stable isotope analyses were used to determine trophic niche and trophic interactions. Redclaw crayfish were shown to be omnivores and their diet consisted mainly of algae, plant material and invertebrates. Small-sized individuals had a constricted niche width and fed primarily on invertebrates, whereas larger individuals expanded their niche width to include larger proportions of plant material. Crayfish caught from lotic environments had a higher proportion of invertebrates in their diet than crayfish from lentic environments, and the species exploited a wider niche in summer than in winter. These differences are likely related to differences in productivity amongst habitats and fluctuations in resource availability. There was significant niche overlap (>60%) between redclaw crayfish and Sidney's river crab (Potamonautes sidneyi), but not with other native invertebrates. Both species are omnivores and have similar functional roles, possibly making redclaw crayfish functionally redundant in this ecosystem. Even though both species mainly feed on resources (plant material and invertebrates) that are not normally limiting, the redclaw crayfish invasion might be an accelerator of ecosystem processes such as shredding and decomposition rates of plant material. There is, therefore, a need for further studies to examine potentially altered ecosystem functions caused by redclaw crayfish invasion in the Inkomati River system.

In such a high-cold Third Pole with extensive lakes, how does aeolian sediment transport on ice cover and to what extent can seasonal ice-covered lake cause sediment redistribution by providing pathways for sediment migration is rarely studied. The source region of Yellow River (SRYR) is located in the northeastern TP with an altitude above 4000 m, is home to large area of seasonal frozen lakes. Nine sections of aeolian sediments were collected from SRYR for grain-size study. The end-member modeling analysis (EMMA) provides a greater chance of resolving aeolian sediment sources since it can quantitatively separate the particle size components of various sedimentary dynamic processes and sources in the sediment. The result shows great spatial difference of the mean grain sizes (mainly varying between 70 and 230 mu m). Parametric EMMA is applied to study the provenance tracing of aeolian sediment, combining with remote sensing images and wind data. Aeolian processes were analyzed by separating and extracting the grain size end-members of nine sections, and four statistical end-members (modal grain size is 8.9, 79.5, 141.6, and 251.8 mu m, respectively) were classified from the grain size distribution. It shows that the sedimentary sequences in sections 7 and 8 have high EM2 and EM3 fractions and very low EM4 content at all depths. Based on comprehensive analysis of aeolian sediment grain-size, phenology of ice lake, wind regime and remote sensing images, it revealed that the fine aeolian sediments (sections 7 and 8) on the downwind shore of Ngoring Lake likely transported from the upwind shore, which were blown across the ice-covered lake surface by prevailing west wind in winter and spring, but the coarse sediments could be trapped by ice cracks. Therefore, it's concluded that the aeolian sediment transport on seasonal ice-covered lakes may lead to the spatial heterogeneity of aeolian sediment grain-size in the SRYR.

J	Papadopoulos, AP; Hao, XM				Papadopoulos, AP; Hao, XM			Effects of day and night air temperature in early season on growth, productivity and energy use of spring tomato	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCE												Effects of air temperature on tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill) growth, yield and heating energy consumption were investigated in spring of 1993 and 1994. Tomato plants were grown under nine day/night air temperature regimes formed by factorial combination of three day (19, 20 and 21 degreesC) and three night (16, 17 and 18 degreesC) heating temperature set points. Early (until 30 April) fruit yield increased but early fruit size decreased with increasing daily average air temperature (MT, 24-h mean). The plants grown under high daily average air temperature early in the season had lower fruit yield late in the season. Plants grown under high night air temperature (NT) and low day air temperature (DT) during the early production period achieved high fruit yield in early season and avoided the negative effects of high MT on early fruit size; these plants also had high yield and large fruit size late in the season. The different day and night heating temperature regimes studied caused no more than 10% in heating energy use variation. Therefore, for greenhouse tomato production under Great Lakes conditions (approx. 42 degreesN), the optimal day/night air temperature (from January to April) is 20.8-21.0/18.5-19.0 degreesC (actual air temperatures).																			0008-4220					APR	2001	81	2					303	311		10.4141/P00-064	http://dx.doi.org/10.4141/P00-064													WOS:000169474200015
J	Wilson, MVH				Wilson, MVH			Taphonomy of a mass-death layer of fishes in the Paleocene Paskapoo Formation at Joffre Bridge, Alberta, Canada	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												A layer of silty mudstone only a few centimetres thick, in the lower part of the mainly fluvial Paskapoo Formation, contains thousands of complete skeletons of fossil fish and is Tiffanian (Late Paleocene, Ti3) in age. The diversity represented in the layer is low, with thousands of specimens of a species in the trout-perch family (Percopsidae), tens of specimens of a species in the smelt family (Osmeridae), and just two specimens of a species of osteoglossomorph in the family Osteoglossidae recovered to date. Although the fishes occur without other kinds of fossils in the ''Fish Layer,'' other layers in the same outcrop have yielded abundant remains of plants, insects, mollusks, and mammals. Taphonomic features of the Fish Layer are used to test the hypothesis that it represents a mass-death event and to evaluate mechanisms of formation. There is little disarticulation and no sign of scavenging, fish occur in distinct size classes, individuals of the smelt species demonstrate breeding tubercles, fish tend to be clumped together on a scale of a few metres or less, and fish tend to lie with their heads facing one or perhaps two preferred directions. These findings suggest that the deposit represents a mass-death event, probably occurring during spring or early summer high water while the fish were attempting to spawn in shallow water, and that the layer itself was deposited under the influence of gentle currents and wave action. Such conditions could have occurred during or following a flood that trapped the fish in an overbank, backswamp, or abandoned-channel pond or shallow lake, as has recently been suggested on sedimentological and stratigraphic evidence. Rapid burial is probably the reason for the lack of scavenging and disarticulation. This deposit shows that well-preserved fish skeletons can be found in large numbers in fluvial formations, representing paleoenvironments and time intervals for which our knowledge of fish diversity has been poor in the past.

Deepwater Renewal in a Large, Deep Lake (Lake Geneva): Identifying and Quantifying Winter Cooling Processes Using Heat Budget Decomposition	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Wintertime deepwater renewal, which is important for heat-oxygen-nutrient exchange in lakes, is traditionally considered to be mainly driven by 1D vertical convective cooling. However, differential cooling between shallow and deep waters can produce density currents that flow into deep layers. In order to determine the role that these two cooling processes play in deepwater renewal, field measurements and 3D numerical modeling were combined to investigate heat content dynamics in Lake Geneva's large basin, the Grand Lac (maximum depth 309 m), during an exceptionally cold air spell in early 2012 where complete overturning had been reported. In a novel approach, the heat budget of the lake was decomposed, which allowed the identification and quantification of the heat budget components. The heat budget decomposition revealed that vertical convective cooling only penetrated to 200 m and that lateral advection was not only caused by density currents being discharged from the shallow littoral zone of the Grand Lac, but also from the Lake's shallow Petit Lac basin (maximum depth 75 m); the latter was found to be the main driver of heat content decrease in the deep layers of the Grand Lac below similar to 200-m depth. These findings provide unique insight into heat exchange processes that cannot be obtained from field data or numerical simulations alone. Heat budget decomposition proved to be a powerful, universally applicable tool for quantifying the contribution of alternative deepwater renewal processes. This is important, since deepwater renewal by convective cooling is weakening due to persistent global warming. Winter cooling is an important process for heat-oxygen-nutrient exchange in lakes. Traditionally considered to be mainly driven by 1D vertical convective cooling, complete overturning occurs when temperatures become homogeneous over the full water depth. In most deep lakes, this only occurs occasionally. Complete overturning in 309-m deep Lake Geneva was reported for winter 2012. Field measurements taken at the deepest part of the lake, however, showed that the lake's temperature profile during that winter was not uniform. Instead, it had a cooler, deep bottom layer. To understand this temperature profile, we used 3D numerical modeling to decompose the lake's heat budget. This novel approach made it possible to investigate and quantify the contribution of: (a) vertical top-down convective cooling, and (b) lateral advection of cold water from shallower regions to the lake's deep layers. The results revealed that convective cooling did not reach below similar to 200-m depth. Instead, lateral cold-water advection from the lake's shallow side basin and nearshore regions were responsible for the cooling and deepwater renewal below that depth. As climate change induced-warming continues to weaken convective cooling, it will become increasingly important to understand and consider lateral advection as an alternative deepwater renewal process in large, deep lakes. Deepwater renewal in a large, 309-m deep lake during a very cold air spell is investigated by field observations and 3D numerical modeling A novel heat budget decomposition methodology allows for quantification of contributions of different processes to deepwater renewal Lateral advection by density currents from shallow areas and a side basin was identified as the governing process in deepwater renewal					Reiss, Rafael S./HKW-6903-2023; Barry, D./C-6077-2008; Barry, David/C-6077-2008	Reiss, Rafael S./0000-0002-5000-6799; Barry, David/0000-0002-8621-0425; Mettra, Francois/0000-0001-7423-6444; PENG, Naifu/0000-0003-0894-9045													0043-1397	1944-7973				APR	2024	60	4							e2023WR034936	10.1029/2023WR034936	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023WR034936													WOS:001204657400001

Late Holocene summer temperatures in the central Andes reconstructed from the sediments of high-elevation Laguna Chepical, Chile (32° S)	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												High-resolution reconstructions of climate variability that cover the past millennia are necessary to improve the understanding of natural and anthropogenic climate change across the globe. Although numerous records are available for the mid-and high-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, global assessments are still compromised by the scarcity of data from the Southern Hemisphere. This is particularly the case for the tropical and subtropical areas. In addition, high elevation sites in the South American Andes may provide insight into the vertical structure of climate change in the mid-troposphere. This study presents a 3000 yr-long austral summer (November to February) temperature reconstruction derived from the Pb-210- and C-14-dated organic sediments of Laguna Chepical (32 degrees 16'S, 70 degrees 30'W, 3050 m a.s.l.), a high-elevation glacial lake in the subtropical Andes of central Chile. Scanning reflectance spectroscopy in the visible light range provided the spectral index R-570/R-630, which reflects the clay mineral content in lake sediments. For the calibration period (AD 1901-2006), the R-570/R-630 data were regressed against monthly meteorological reanalysis data, showing that this proxy was strongly and significantly correlated with mean summer (NDJF) temperatures (R-3yr = -0.63, p(adj) = 0.01). This calibration model was used to make a quantitative temperature reconstruction back to 1000 BC. The reconstruction (with a model error RMSEPboot of 0.33 degrees C) shows that the warmest decades of the past 3000 yr occurred during the calibration period. The 19th century (end of the Little Ice Age (LIA)) was cool. The prominent warmth reconstructed for the 18th century, which was also observed in other records from this area, seems systematic for subtropical and southern South America but remains difficult to explain. Except for this warm period, the LIA was generally characterized by cool summers. Back to AD 1400, the results from this study compare remarkably well to low altitude records from the Chilean Central Valley and southern South America. However, the reconstruction from Laguna Chepical does not show a warm Medieval Climate Anomaly during the 12-13th century, which is consistent with records from tropical South America. The Chepical record also indicates substantial cooling prior to 800 BC. This coincides with well-known regional as well as global glacier advances which have been attributed to a grand solar minimum. This study thus provides insight into the climatic drivers and temperature patterns in a region for which currently very few data are available. It also shows that since ca. AD 1400, long-term temperature patterns were generally similar at low and high altitudes in central Chile.

By 1998, approximately 4 ha of the I 10 ha lake was covered wish variable watermilfoil. In 1999, the milfoil was spot treated with Aquacide(R), an 18% active ingredient of the sodium salt of 2,4-D [ (2,4-dichlorophenoxy) acetic acid], applied at a rate of 114 kg/ha. Aquacide(R) was used because labeling regarding domestic water intakes and irrigation limitations prevented the use of Navigate(R) or AquaKleen(R), a 19% active ingredient of the butoxyethyl ester of 2,4-D. Variable watermilfoil was partially controlled in shallow protected coves but little control occurred in deeper more exposed locations. 2,4-D levels in the treatment sites were lower than desired and offsite dilution was rapid. In 2000, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) issued a special local need (SLN) registration to allow the use of Navigate(R) or AquaKleen(R) in lakes with potable and irrigation water intakes. Navigate(R) was applied at a rate of 227 kg/ha to the same areas as treated in 1999. An additional 2 ha of variable watermilfoil was treated with Navigate(R) in 2001, and 0.4 ha was treated in mid-September. Dilution of the 2,4-D ester formulation to untreated areas was slower than with the salt formulation. Concentrations of 2,4-D exceeded 1000 mug/L in several lake water samples in 2000 but not 2001. Nearly all of the treated variable watermilfoil was controlled in both years. The mid-September treatment appeared as effective as the spring and early summer treatments. Testing of homeowner wells in all 3 years found no detectable levels of 2,4-D.

Geographically, the largest number of such manifestations were found on Japanese and Kuril Islands. These waters are formed by: (1) condensation of magmatic vapor under shallow conditions and/or (2) dissolution of magmatic gases in underground waters; (3) near-surface mixing of steam-heated sulphate waters with sodium-chloride waters of deeper formation; (4) interaction of sodium chloride waters with the rocks undergone by argillic and advanced-argillic alteration, including hydrolysis of elemental sulfur; (5) a combination of several of the listed processes. Criteria to assess the nature of such waters using their chemical and isotopic composition are based on the relative abundances of major species and trends in isotopic compositions generally controlling by mixing of magmatic-host rock-meteoric endmembers. An overview of available data on temporal chemical variations of such waters shows that usually volcanic activity is marked by an increase in the SO4/Cl ratio during or after the eruptive event. The response on the volcanic activity depends on hydrogeological conditions that control the appearance of the ASC springs. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The final combined estimate was 180 .+-. 39 northern pike (23 pike/ha of lake surface). Detailed underwater observation within a specified area was used to asess depth distribution, sample independence, and reaction of northern pike to the presence of the observer. Northern pike selected depths of less than 1 m, and this distribution pattern was constant throughout the summer months, justifying the stratified methodology utilized in the population estimate. Samples were 92% independent, and the reaction of pike to a diver contributed an estimated 4% error to the accuracy of the estimate.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1985	42	11					1835	1840		10.1139/f85-231	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f85-231													WOS:A1985AUV0200020

Mineral magnetism were also measured for surface sediments from the lake, rock debris, surface soils and a soil profile from its catchment and surface soils at the elevations of 600-3767 m a.s.l. of the southern slope of the Mountain. AMS(14)C dating, analyses of pollen, particle size, TOC, TN and delta N-13(org) were conducted for the sediment sequence while pollen analysis was also made for the surface-sediment sample. Variations in chi(lf), chi(ARM), IRM300mT and SIRM of the sediment sequence were attributed to changes in erosion intensity, while those in IRM20mT/ARM and particularly chi(ARM)/SIRM to changes in soil maturity. With aid of the other data, the magnetic data of the sediment sequence revealed environmental changes over the past similar to 5520 years. The weighted chi(ARM)/SIRM values of the sediment sequence in comparison with chi(ARM)/SIRM of the surface soils distributed on different elevations allowed estimating the altitudes where the present environments are similar to the past ones for different periods of the past similar to 5520 years. The reconstructed environmental changes are generally in agreement with the centennial-scale variability of EASM indicated by a stalagmite O-18 record and with that of EAWM indicated by an O-18 record of planktonic foraminiferal.

Similar convection is observed in ice-covered freshwater lakes, where the water temperature is below the maximum-density temperature during late spring. The convective length, velocity, and temperature scales are introduced, which are suitable for the description of convection driven by a vertically inhomogeneous heating. On the basis of these scales and the similarity hypotheses for the vertical temperature profiles and turbulence characteristics in the convective mixed layer, a simple model of the convection regime under consideration is proposed. The entrainment regimes characteristic of the convection in ice-covered lakes are studied. It is shown that such convection is satisfactorily described by the equation used for convection in both the atmospheric and oceanic layers if the Deardorff convective scales based on the buoyancy flow through a fluid surface are replaced by the convective scales, which take into account the three-dimensional character of radiation absorption. The results of model calculations are in good agreement with observational data.					; Mironov, Denis/AAM-4014-2021; Terzhevik, Arkady/L-7911-2013	Mironov, Dmitrii/0000-0002-3228-5851; Terzhevik, Arkady/0000-0002-0837-9065													0001-4338					SEP-OCT	2000	36	5					627	634																WOS:000089912800010

The seasonal changes in filament dimensions and the occurrence of separation valves in a population of Melosira granulata (Ehrenb.) Ralfs were investigated in a eutrophic lake in southern England [UK]. Experiments were carried out in culture to study the effects of various environmental factors on the diatom''s morphology. 2. Major blooms of M. granulata occurred from September to October, coinciding with an increase in mean filament length brought about by the high growth rate of the diatom. This increase was controlled by a reduction in the frequency of separation valve production. A similar increase in filament length occurred in rapidly growing cultures. 3. The population was lost from the epilimnion when thermal stratification occurred. Immediately prior to this the population consisted of short filaments. 4. The mean filament length was greatest during occasional summer blooms and was again controlled by a reduction in the frequency of separation valve production. This appeared to be a response to the reduced nutrient concentration in the lake. This is supported by similar morphological changes in low nutrient cultures. 5. Increases in the filament length of the diatom were accompanied by increases in the diatom''s sinking velocity. The length increase thus ensured its rapid return to the sediment, after summer growth periods, where the cells could be replenished with nutrients.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				AUG	1987	18	1					5	16		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1987.tb01292.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1987.tb01292.x													WOS:A1987J392100002

In this article we develop an index based on macroinvertebrates sensitive to the gradient of nutrient enrichment. With this aim, we sampled 31 ponds along a gradient of trophy and with similar geomorphological characteristics and watershed use in protected areas of the central Apennines. A bioassessment protocol was adopted to collect and process benthic samples and key-associated physical, chemical, and biological variables during the summer growth season of 1998. We collected 61 genera of macroinvertebrates belonging to 31 families. We calculated 31 macroinvertebrate metrics based on selected and total taxa richness, richness of some key groups, abundance, functional groups and tolerance to organic pollution. The gradient of trophy was quantified with summer concentrations of chlorophyll a. We followed a stepwise procedure to evaluate the effectiveness of a given metric for use in the multimetric index. Those were the pollution tolerance metric ASPT, three metrics based on taxonomic richness (the richness of macroinvertebrate genera, the richness of chironomid taxa, and the percentage of total richness composed by Ephemeroptera, Odonata, and Trichoptera), two metrics based on FFG attributes (richness of collector gatherer taxa and richness of scraper taxa) and the habit-based metric richness of burrowers. The 95th percentile of each metric distribution among all ponds was trisected for metric scoring. The final Pond Macroinvertebrate Integrity Index ranged from 7 to 35 and had a good correlation (R(2) = 0.71) with the original gradient of environmental degradation.					; Solimini, Angelo/C-9290-2018	Solimini, Angelo/0000-0002-5281-7624; 													0018-8158					FEB	2008	597						109	123		10.1007/s10750-007-9226-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-007-9226-7													WOS:000251874200010
J	Heuvel, CE; Zhao, YM; Fisk, AT				Heuvel, Cecilia Elizabeth; Zhao, Yingming; Fisk, Aaron Thomas			Influence of spatial and temporal variation on establishing stable isotope baselines of δ15N, δ13C, and δ34S in a large freshwater lake	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												It is essential to establish a baseline in studies using stable isotopes to interpret trophic relationships across ecosystems and through time. Studies in freshwater ecosystems struggle to quantify baseline stable isotopes due to difficulties collecting representative samples, particularly from pelagic habitats. We assessed temporal and spatial variation in delta C-13, delta N-15, and delta S-34 in a commonly used pelagic baseline, seston (n = 156), in Lake Erie to understand mechanisms that correlate with baseline stable isotope dynamics in large lakes. Seston contains a wide range of material which can confound stable isotope interpretation, and we examined the utility of element content and ratios to account for variation in sample source. Seston was collected in each of the three basins of Lake Erie from May to October in 2017-2019 at nearshore (<10 m depth) and offshore (>10 m depth) sites. General linear models were conducted on each stable isotope (delta N-15, delta C-13, and delta S-34) and sample composition (variables: %N, %C, %S, C:N, C:S, and N:S) to assess how basin, month, and collection year influenced seston stable isotopes and composition. Sample composition (variables: %N, %C, %S, C:N, C:S, and N:S), which is rarely reported for organisms in stable isotope studies, was constant throughout the sample period with no temporal or spatial trends except for small variations in %C, C:N, C:S, and N:S. This indicated that the temporal and spatial trends observed within the stable isotopes were related to seasonal changes in system processes and plankton community dynamics, with few or minimal changes in the amount of detrital and inorganic material within seston. Values and trends of delta N-15, delta C-13, and delta S-34 in seston were comparable to those measured previously in Lake Erie and other Laurentian Great Lakes. All three isotopes increased from May to October of each sample year and varied spatially, delta N-15 was higher, delta S-34 was lower, and delta C-13 was the same in the west basin compared to the central and eastern basins of Lake Erie, which did not differ. These trends probably reflect seasonal changes in plankton community composition and nutrient cycling throughout the lake and are potentially linked to the presence of Microcystis blooms in the western basin during the late summer and autumn. Seston turns over quickly, as shown by the rapid changes in stable isotope values throughout the study, which confounds the investigation of stable isotopes in upper trophic levels, and especially in organisms that have slower tissue turnover and move throughout the lake seasonally. Additionally, the variable composition of seston (e.g., % C, % N, % S, C:N, C:S, N:S) necessitates analysing sample composition to determine the degree of abiotic (e.g., detritus, sediment, particulate organic matter) and biotic (e.g., phytoplankton, zooplankton) content in it.

Based on the coexistence of highly recrystallized fragments and unequilibrated components, Rumuruti is classified as a type 3-6 chondrite breccia. The most abundant phase of Rumuruti is olivine (mostly Fa (approximately 39) with about 70 vol%. Feldspar (approximately 14 vol%, mainly plagioclase), Ca-pyroxene (5 vol%), pyrrhotite (4.4 vol%), and pentlandite (3.6 vol%) are major constituents. All other phases have abundances below 1 vol%, including low-Ca pyroxene, chrome spinels, phosphates (chlorapatite and whitlockite), chalcopyrite, ilmenite, tridymite, Ni-rich and Ge-containing metals, kamacite, and various particles enriched in noble metals like Pt, Ir, and Au. The chemical composition of Rumuruti is chondritic. The depletion in refractory elements (Sc, REE, etc.) and the comparatively high Mn, Na, and K contents are characteristic of ordinary chondrites and distinguish Rumuruti from carbonaceous chondrites. However, S, Se, and Zn contents in Rumuruti are significantly above the level expected for ordinary chondrites. The oxygen isotope composition of Rumuruti is high in deltaO-17 (5.52 parts per thousand) and deltaO-18 (5.07 parts per thousand). Previously, a small number of chondritic meteorites with strong similarities to Rumuruti were described. They were called Carlisle Lakes-type chondrites and they comprise: Carlisle Lakes, ALH85151, Y-75302, Y-793575, Y-82002, Acfer 217, PCA91002, and PCA91241, as well as clasts in the Weatherford chondrite. All these meteorites are finds from hot and cold deserts having experienced various degrees of weathering. With Rumuruti, the first meteorite fall has been recognized that preserves the primary mineralogical and chemical characteristics of a new group of meteorites. Comparing all chondrites, the characteristic features can be summarized as follows: (a) basically chondritic chemistry with ordinary chondrite element patterns of refractory and moderately volatile lithophiles but higher abundances of S, Se, and Zn; (b) high degree of oxidation (37-41 mol% Fa in olivine, only traces of Fe,Ni-metals, occurrence of chalcopyrite); (c) exceptionally high DELTO-17 values of about 2.7 for bulk samples; (d) high modal abundance of olivine (approximately 70 vol%); (e) Ti-Fe3+-rich chromite (approximately 5.5 wt% TiO2); (f) occurrence of various noble metal-rich particles; (g) abundant chondritic breccias consisting of equilibrated clasts and unequilibrated lithologies. With Rumuruti, nine meteorite samples exist that are chemically and mineralogically very similar. These meteorites are attributed to at least eight different fall events. It is proposed in this paper to call this group R chondrites (rumurutiites) after the first and only fall among these meteorites. These meteorites have a close relationship to ordinary chondrites. However, they are more oxidized than any of the existing groups of ordinary chondrites. Small, but significant differences in chemical composition and in oxygen isotopes between R chondrites and ordinary chondrites exclude formation of R chondrites from ordinary chondrites, by oxidation. This implies a separate, independent R chondrite parent body.																			0026-1114					MAR	1994	29	2					275	286		10.1111/j.1945-5100.1994.tb00681.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1945-5100.1994.tb00681.x													WOS:A1994ND20200017

Although human activities increasingly influenced ecosystems during the Holocene, many paleo-records primarily reconstruct natural environmental changes, often neglecting the pre-instrumental human influenceon ecological responses. To understand ecosystem responses comprehensively, it is essential to consider anthropogenic impacts alongside natural factors. Here, we present a Holocene chironomid record from Qinghai Crater Lake in Tengchong, southwestern China, examining the timing and magnitude of natural and anthropogenic impacts on the lake ecosystem throughout the Holocene. Our results reveal that early to mid-Holocene chironomid communities, especially in terms of species richness, were mainly driven by rising summer temperatures associated with increased solar radiation. By the late-Holocene, the weakening Indian Summer Monsoon led to fluctuating lake levels and intensified human impacts, impacting both chironomid species richness and community stability. Around 0.8 ka BP, enhanced human disturbances shifted the chironomid community composition from mesotrophic taxa dominance (e.g., Cladotanytasus, Macropelopia) to eutrophic taxa dominance (e.g., Chironomus, Polypedilum). Over the past few centuries, human influence has further increased chironomid species richness but has led to declining community stability.					sun, weiwei/GQG-8925-2022														1674-7313	1869-1897				FEB	2025	68	2					498	508		10.1007/s11430-024-1460-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11430-024-1460-4		DEC 2024											WOS:001371171000001

Evaluating the spatial pattern of water quality of the Nile River, Egypt, through multivariate analysis of chemical and biological indicators	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												The Nile River, known as the "giver of life," serves as Egypt's main source of fresh water. A total of 28 sites along the Nile River were selected during the winter and summer of 2022 to illustrate spatial-temporal variation and indicate potential sources of pollution. The study showed that all chemical and physical parameters are within permissible limits. Based on the abiotic parameters, discriminant analysis (DA) classified the collected Nile sites into three groups (A, B, and C). Group A included the southern sites characterized by high transparency and low levels of electrical conductivity (EC), pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), biological oxygen demand (BOD), and chemical oxygen demand (COD). Group B included the middle sites and was characterized by the relatively high means of EC, total dissolved solid (TDS), pH, DO, BOD, and COD. Group C included the northern sites, which are characterized by low transparency and the highest value of nutrients and EC. A total of 113 phytoplankton species belonging to seven phyla were recorded, while a total of 52 zooplankton species were recorded. The lowest abundance and diversity of phytoplankton and zooplankton were detected at the southern sites, which increased gradually to attain the highest density and diversity in the northern sites. The submerged macrophyte species were recorded in the study area with low species diversity, and Myriophyllum spicatum was the dominant one. 98 epiphytic diatoms and 30 species of macroinvertebrates attached to macrophytes were recorded. The blood parameters of Oreochromis niloticus were within normal limits except for those collected from the Greater Cairo governorate sites in the north. The study showed an improvement in Nile water quality due to increased water levels and water discharged into the Nile.

Cestodes change the isotopic signature of brine shrimp, Artemia, hosts: Implications for aquatic food webs	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY												To reach the final host (greater flamingos), the cestode Flamingolepis liguloides alters the behaviour of its intermediate host, the brine shrimp, Artemia parthenogenetica, causing it to spend more time close to the water surface. During summer 2010, we showed that the prevalence of this cestode was consistently higher at the top of the water column in the Odiel salt pans in south-western Spain. We used stable nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) isotopic analysis to test the hypothesis that cestodes also alter resource use by Artemia. In early summer, we compared stable isotopes in infected hosts at the surface with those from uninfected hosts at the bottom of the water column. In late summer, we compared infected and uninfected Artemia from the bottom. delta N-15 was consistently enriched in infected individuals compared with uninfected hosts, especially in Artemia with multiple infections of F. liguloides (family Hymenolepididae) and those with mixed infections of F. liguloides and cestodes of the family Dilepididae. Infected individuals from the surface were enriched in delta C-13 compared with uninfected ones from the bottom, but the opposite was found when comparing uninfected and infected Artemia from the same depth. This may be caused by the increase in lipid concentration in infected Artemia. Isolated cysticercoids of F. liguloides were significantly enriched in delta C-13 compared with cysticercoids in infected hosts, but surprisingly were not enriched in N. Our findings illustrate the way cestodes can alter food webs and highlight the importance of considering the parasitic status of prey in studies of trophic ecology in saline wetlands.

However, today's highly intense urban construction patterns cause poor urban air mobility and excessive residual heat accumulation, and weaken water bodies' regulating effects. This study examines the relationship between urban morphology and water bodies' microclimatic regulation during summer in the water-network city, Wuhan, using remote sensing data and the weather research and forecasting (WRF). This study found (1) on the waterfront, the key impact indicators for microclimate in the waterfront are building density (BD) and floor area ratio (FAR), both of which can lead to higher temperatures and lower humidity, (2) BD significantly warmed the waterfront on the large lakes, while FAR impacted the urban main windway areas, (3) urban development with high FAR significantly suppressed the water's cooling ability in the downtown and main windway areas, with the cooling intensity decreased by 28.7% and 20.6%, respectively, and the cooling distance decreased by 13.5% and 15%. These findings provide insights for the practice of climate adaptive planning and design on the water networkrelated urban areas of Wuhan and other places with similar environments.					zhang, tiantian/AIE-2834-2022; Zhou, Xuefan/AAY-4096-2021														0360-1323	1873-684X				DEC	2022	226								109720	10.1016/j.buildenv.2022.109720	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2022.109720		NOV 2022											WOS:000884391800001

However, the shortage of highly-resolved land temperature records remains a limiting factor for achieving a comprehensive understanding of long-term low-latitude terrestrial climatic changes. Here, we report paired mean annual air temperature (MAAT) and monsoon intensity proxy records over the past 88,000 years from Lake Tengchongqinghai in southwestern China. While summer monsoon intensity follows the -23,000-year precession beat found also in previous studies, we identify previously unrecognized warm periods at 88,000-71,000 and 45,000-22,000 years ago, with 2-3 degrees C amplitudes that are close to our recorded full glacial-interglacial range. Using advanced transient climate simulations and comparing with forcing factors, we find that these warm periods in our MAAT record probably depends on local annual mean insolation, which is controlled by Earth's -41,000-year obliquity cycles and is anti-phased to annual mean insolation at high latitudes. The coincidence of our identified warm periods and intervals of high-frequent dated archaeological evidence highlights the importance of temperature on anatomically modern humans in Asia during the last glacial stage.

Human adaptation to mid- to late-Holocene climate change in Northeast Thailand	HOLOCENE												This article integrates palaeoenvironmental and archaeological sequences covering the mid- to late-Holocene in Northeast Thailand. The former reveal the fluctuating intensity of the Asian summer monsoon, leading to periods of higher moisture availability with intervals of relative aridity. The latter are founded on a series of new radiocarbon determinations that provide a basic chronological framework, from the initial Neolithic settlements by rice farmers (c. 3700 cal. BP) to the end of the prehistoric Iron Age around 1300 cal. BP. By dovetailing the two, we find that periods of relative aridity occurred during the later Iron Age as an agricultural revolution witnessed water control measures, plough and irrigated rice cultivation and a marked rise in social elites. The correlation between climatic and cultural changes is found to continue into the period of the Angkorian state. Rather than cause a decline and/or abandonment of late Iron Age settlements, we find that the environmental stress caused by a weaker summer monsoon was met by a strong social response and by adaptations that generated a transition into early socially hierarchic polities.					; Chawchai, Sakonvan/GRF-2426-2022; Smittenberg, Rienk/A-3296-2008	Chawchai, Sakonvan/0000-0003-0527-9381; Smittenberg, Rienk/0000-0001-5578-9916; Yamoah, Afrifa Kweku Kyei/0000-0001-7488-0459; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				NOV	2016	26	11					1875	1886		10.1177/0959683616645947	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683616645947													WOS:000385859800012
J	Qiu, JF; Li, Y; Liu, XG				Qiu, Jingfeng; Li, Yu; Liu, Xinggen			Assessment of the Impact of Extreme Hydrological Conditions on Migratory Bird Habitats of the Largest Freshwater Lake Wetlands in China Based on Multi-Source Remote Sensing Fusion Approach	SUSTAINABILITY												Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake of China, serves as a crucial wintering site for migratory birds in the East Asian-Australasian Flyway, where habitat quality is essential for maintaining diverse bird populations. Recently, the frequent alternation of extreme wet years, e.g., 2020, and dry years, e.g., 2022, have inflicted considerable perturbation on the local wetland ecology, severely impacting avian habitats. This study employed the spatiotemporal fusion method (ESTARFM) to obtain continuous imagery of Poyang Lake National Nature Reserve during the wintering seasons from 2020 to 2022. Habitat areas were identified based on wetland classification and water depth constraints. The results indicate that both extreme wet and dry conditions have exacerbated the fragmentation of migratory bird habitats. The shallow water habitats showed minor short-term fluctuations in response to water levels but were more significantly affected by long-term hydrological trends. These habitats exhibited considerable interannual variability across different hydrological years, affecting both their proportion within the overall habitat and their distribution within the study area. This study demonstrates the ability of ESTARFM to reveal the dynamic changes in migratory bird habitats and their responses to extreme hydrological conditions, highlighting the critical role of water depth in habitat analysis. The outcomes of this study improve the understanding of the impact of extreme water levels on migratory bird habitats, which may help expand knowledge about the protection of other floodplain wetlands around the world.																				2071-1050				MAR	2025	17	5							1900	10.3390/su17051900	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su17051900													WOS:001443510300001

Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is promising for assessing the abundance and community composition of phytoplankton. However, applications of qPCR to indicate eutrophication and trophic status, especially in lotic systems, have yet to be comprehensively evaluated. For the first time, this study correlates qPCR-based phytoplankton abundance with chlorophyll a (the most widely used indicator of eutrophication and trophic status) in multiple freshwater rivers. From early summer to late fall in 2017, 2018, and 2019, we evaluated phytoplankton, chlorophyll a, pheophytin a, and the Trophic Level Index (TLI) in twelve large freshwater rivers in three regions (western, midcontinent, and eastern) in the United States. Chlorophyll a concentration had positive allometric correlations with qPCR-based phytoplankton abundance (adjusted R-2 = 0.5437, p-value < 0.001), pheophytin a concentration (adjusted R-2 = 0.3378, p-value <0.001), and TLI (adjusted R-2 = 0.4789, p-value < 0.001). Thus, a greater phytoplankton abundance suggests a higher trophic status. This work also presents the numerical values of qPCR-based phytoplankton abundance defining the boundaries among trophic statuses (e.g., oligotrophic, mesotrophic, and eutrophic) of freshwater rivers. The sampling sites in the midcontinent rivers were more eutrophic because they had significantly higher chlorophyll a concentrations, pheophytin a concentrations, and TLI values than the sites in the western and eastern rivers. The higher phytoplankton abundance at the midcontinent sites confirmed their higher trophic status. By linking qPCR-based phytoplankton abundance to chlorophyll a, this study demonstrates that qPCR is a promising avenue to investigate the population dynamics of phytoplankton and the trophic status (or eutrophication) of freshwater rivers.																			0048-9697	1879-1026				DEC 1	2024	954								175067	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.175067	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.175067		SEP 2024						39111421					WOS:001319096400001

J	Pasvanoglu, S				Pasvanoglu, Suzan			Hydrogeochemistry of thermal and mineralized waters in the Diyadin (Agri) area, Eastern Turkey	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												The Diyadin Geothermal area, located in the eastern part of Anatolia (Turkey) where there has been recent volcanic activity, is favorable for the formation of geothermal systems. Indeed, the Diyadin geothermal system is located in an active geodynamic zone, where strike-slip faults and tensional cracks have developed due to N-S regional compression. The area is characterized by closely spaced thermal and mineralized springs, with temperatures in the range 30-64 degrees C, and flowrates 0.5-10 L/s. Thermal spring waters are mainly of Ca(Na)-HCO3 and Ca(Mg)-SO4 types, with high salinity, while cold groundwater is mostly of Ca(Na, Mg)-HCO3 type, with lower salinity. High contents of some minor elements in thermal waters, such as F, B, Li, Rb, Sr and Cs probably derive from enhanced water-rock interaction. Thermal water samples collected from Diyadin are far from chemical equilibrium as the waters flow upward from reservoirs towards spring vents and possibly mix with cooler waters. The temperatures of the deep geothermal reservoirs are estimated to be between 92 and 156 degrees C in Diyadin field, based on quartz geothermometry, while slightly lower estimates are obtained using chalcedony geothermometers. The isotopic composition of thermal water (delta O-18, delta H-2, delta H-3) indicates their deep-circulating meteoric origin. The waters are likely to have originated from the percolation of rainwater along fractures and faults to the deep hot reservoir. Subsequent heating by conduction due to the presence of an intrusive cupola associated with the Tendurek volcano, is followed by the ascent of deep waters to the surface along faults and fractures that act as hydrothermal conduits. Modeling of the geothermal fluids indicates that the fluid is oversaturated with calcite, aragonite and dolomite, which matches travertine precipitation in the discharge area. Likewise, the fluid is oversaturated with respect to quartz, and chalcedony indicating the possibility of siliceous precipitation near the discharge areas. A conceptual hydro-geochemical model of the Diyadin thermal waters based on the isotope and chemical analytical results, has been constructed. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Li, HY; Barber, M; Lu, JR; Goel, R				Li, Hanyan; Barber, Mike; Lu, Jingrang; Goel, Ramesh			Microbial community successions and their dynamic functions during harmful cyanobacterial blooms in a freshwater lake	WATER RESEARCH												The current study reports the community succession of different toxin and non-toxin producing cyanobacteria at different stages of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CyanoHABs) and their connectivity with nitrogen and phosphorus cycles in a freshwater lake using an ecogenomics framework. Comprehensive high throughput DNA sequencing, water quality parameter measurements, and functional gene expressions over temporal and spatial scales were employed. Among the cyanobacterial community, the lake was initially dominated by Cyanobium during the months of May, June, and early July, and later primarily by Aphanizomenon and Dolichospermum depicting functional redundancy. Finally, Planktothrix appeared in late August and then the dominance switched to Planktothrix in September. Microcystis aeruginosa and Microcystis panniformis; two species responsible for cyanotoxin production, were also present in August and September, but in significantly smaller relative abundance. MC-LR (0.06-1.32 mu g/L) and MCRR (0.01-0.26 mu g/L) were two major types of cyanotoxins detected. The presence of MC-LR and MC-RR were significantly correlated with the Microcystis-related genes (16SMic/mcyA/mcyG) and their expressions (r = 0.33 to 0.8, p < 0.05). The metabolic analyses further linked the presence of different cyanobacterial groups with distinct functions. The nitrogen metabolisms detected a relatively higher abundance of nitrite/nitrate reductase in early summer, indicating significant denitrification activity and the activation of N-fixation in the blooms dominated by Aphanizomenon/Dolichospermum (community richness) during nutrient-limited conditions. The phosphorus and carbohydrate metabolisms detected a trend to initiate a nutrient starvation alert and store nutrients from early summer, while utilizing the stored polyphosphate and carbohydrate (PPX and F6PPK) during the extreme ortho-P scarcity period, mostly in August or September. Specifically, the abundance of Aphanizomenon and Dolichospermum was positively correlated with the nitrogen-fixing nif gene and (p < 0.001) and the PPX enzyme for the stored polyphosphate utilization (r = 0.77, p < 0.001). Interestingly, the lake experienced a longer N-fixing period (2-3 months) before non-fixing cyanobacteria (Planktothrix) dominated the entire lake in late summer. The Provo Bay site, which is known to be nutrient-rich historically, had early episodes of filamentous cyanobacteria blooms compared to the rest of the lake. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

We compiled information on the impacts of mass mortality events due to Cyprinid Herpesvirus-3 (CyHV-3), otherwise known as Koi Herpesvirus, on wild North American populations of the invasive cyprinid, Cyprinus carpio (common carp), based on our personal experiences, discussions with North American fish ecologists and virologists, a detailed survey of technical and popular publications and a web search. We found evidence of 17 mass die-offs of carp due to CyHV-3 in North America since 2004, for 7 of which we were able to obtain information about carp before and after the events. For 6 of the events, effects of the die-offs on carp population indices appeared to be slight. Carp size-frequency distributions before and after the well-documented 2007/08 event in Ontario were also not conspicuously different. The exceptional event was at Blue Springs Lake, Missouri, in 2012, at which we estimate 65% of the carp present died as a result of CyHV-3 infections and carp abundance continues to decline. Why Blue Springs Lake differs from other events in North America is not clear. Overall, carp die-offs due to CyHV-3 in North America (1) confirm laboratory studies that only common carp are affected, (2) are of brief duration (3-6 weeks), (3) are not repeated in subsequent years and (4) cause much lower mortality (with the exception of Blue Springs Lake) than previously reported for carp in aquaculture facilities or in the laboratory. In terms of both wild carp and their effects on aquatic communities, the short and long-term effects of most die-offs appear to be slight. These features could have implications for the effectiveness of the proposed use of CyHV-3 to reduce feral carp populations in Australia.

J	Carey, MP; Zimmerman, CE				Carey, Michael P.; Zimmerman, Christian E.			Physiological and ecological effects of increasing temperature on fish production in lakes of Arctic Alaska	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Lake ecosystems in the Arctic are changing rapidly due to climate warming. Lakes are sensitive integrators of climate-induced changes and prominent features across the Arctic landscape, especially in lowland permafrost regions such as the Arctic Coastal Plain of Alaska. Despite many studies on the implications of climate warming, how fish populations will respond to lake changes is uncertain for Arctic ecosystems. Least Cisco (Coregonus sardinella) is a bellwether for Arctic lakes as an important consumer and prey resource. To explore the consequences of climate warming, we used a bioenergetics model to simulate changes in Least Cisco production under future climate scenarios for lakes on the Arctic Coastal Plain. First, we used current temperatures to fit Least Cisco consumption to observed annual growth. We then estimated growth, holding food availability, and then feeding rate constant, for future projections of temperature. Projected warmer water temperatures resulted in reduced Least Cisco production, especially for larger size classes, when food availability was held constant. While holding feeding rate constant, production of Least Cisco increased under all future scenarios with progressively more growth in warmer temperatures. Higher variability occurred with longer projections of time mirroring the expanding uncertainty in climate predictions further into the future. In addition to direct temperature effects on Least Cisco growth, we also considered changes in lake ice phenology and prey resources for Least Cisco. A shorter period of ice cover resulted in increased production, similar to warming temperatures. Altering prey quality had a larger effect on fish production in summer than winter and increased relative growth of younger rather than older age classes of Least Cisco. Overall, we predicted increased production of Least Cisco due to climate warming in lakes of Arctic Alaska. Understanding the implications of increased production of Least Cisco to the entire food web will be necessary to predict ecosystem responses in lakes of the Arctic.					; Carey, Michael/G-9516-2012	Zimmerman, Christian/0000-0002-3646-0688; Carey, Michael/0000-0002-3327-8995													2045-7758					MAY	2014	4	10					1981	1993		10.1002/ece3.1080	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.1080								24963391					WOS:000336491600020
J	Trolle, D; Jorgensen, TB; Jeppesen, E				Trolle, Dennis; Jorgensen, Torben B.; Jeppesen, Erik			Predicting the effects of reduced external nitrogen loading on the nitrogen dynamics and ecological state of deep Lake Ravn, Denmark, using the DYRESM-CAEDYM model	LIMNOLOGICA												We used the one-dimensional DYRESM-CAEDYM model, developed at the Centre for Water Research, University of Western Australia, to elucidate the role of nitrogen and nitrogen dynamics in the ecosystem of moderately deep Lake Ravn situated in an agricultural landscape in Denmark. We calibrated the model on a 7-year monitoring period and tested it successfully on another 5-year period. The model reproduced well the temperature and oxygen in both the epilimnion and the hypolimnion; however, the epilimnion oxygen concentration at its peak in late spring was generally underestimated. Monitoring data on nitrate and total nitrogen (TN) was well reproduced, although TN in the hypolimnion during the validation period was overestimated. RMSE values were overall similar for the calibration and the validation periods. Simulations of scenarios with a reduced external nutrient loading suggest that a substantial reduction (75%) of the TN input is required to obtain nitrogen concentrations sufficiently low to diminish phytoplankton biomass, while a 90% reduction is needed to significantly increase the depth limit of submerged vegetation. Model simulations suggest that a reduction of the external total phosphorus (TP) loading would be more feasible, as phytoplankton biomass significantly declines at a TP loading reduction of 40-50%. While our study demonstrates that nitrogen plays a minor role as limiting nutrient in Lake Ravn, the role of nitrogen can be more important in shallow polymictic, eutrophic lakes, where summer nitrate concentrations are often low. Thus a case-by-case analysis is required when setting targets for the critical loading of nitrogen and phosphorus in individual lakes - an approach named the "new immission concept" by Benndorf [2005. Ecotechnology: basis of a new immission concept in water pollution control. Water Sci.

J	Cotner, JB				Cotner, JB			Intense winter heterotrophic production stimulated by benthic resuspension	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												A major episodic sediment resuspension event (25-yr high), which was triggered by atmospheric and water column instability in an El Nino year, temporarily altered the dynamics of autotrophy and heterotrophy in Lake Michigan. Resuspended sediments, rich in organic and inorganic nutrients, especially phosphorus, stimulated heterotrophic production despite low water temperatures (2 degreesC or less). During the resuspension event, southern basin winter heterotrophic bacterial productivity was high (64% of summertime productivity) especially along the margins of the lake. The mean bacterial cell size increased in regions where productivity was highest during the resuspension event. Although resuspended sediments stimulated bacterial secondary productivity, hey simultaneously decreased water-column light availability and autotroph biomass. Consequently, heterotrophic bacteria were temporally decoupled from the commonly recognized source of organic matter for bacterial production-photoautotrophy. Variation in the magnitude and frequency of these resuspension events likely influences variation in interannual productivity in this system. Such previously underappreciated, intermittent, and ephemeral benthic-pelagic exchange events may significantly influence plankton dynamics and biogeochemical cycling in coastal marine and freshwater ecosystems.

The ENMZ is an important area lying in northern and northeastern China with scarce precipitation and a vulnerable environment. However, the existing monsoon indices have weaknesses in characterizing the ENMZ precipitation variability, which limits our ability to understand and forecast local climate changes. In this study, a new index, named the ENMZ index (ENMZI), is proposed to represent the variability in ENMZ summer precipitation. The ENMZI is defined by the meridional shear of 200-hPa zonal wind anomalies, expressing the meridional displacement of the East Asian jet and the trough anomaly over Lake Baikal. The ENMZI serves as a regional monsoon index complementing the existing monsoon indices and representing the variabilities in the EASM northward advance and rainfall over northern and northeastern China. The higher the ENMZI is, the higher latitude the EASM reaches, and the more rainfall the ENMZ has. The physical mechanism for the ENMZI representing the ENMZ precipitation variability is explicated by anomalous vorticity and temperature advection associated with the ENMZI and positive feedback between vertical motion and diabatic heating anomalies. The variability of ENMZI is jointly modulated by variabilities in air-sea coupling modes from the North Atlantic, tropical Pacific, and North Indian Ocean and in atmospheric wave trains over Eurasia. Thus, the ENMZI can be a reliable benchmark for studies in climatically sensitive areas in northern and northeastern China.					; Sun, Changfeng/X-2375-2019; Liu, Yu/AAA-6165-2019; Fang, Congxi/AAT-1374-2021	, Changfeng/0000-0001-8648-8120; Fang, Congxi/0000-0002-6106-904X; 													0177-798X	1434-4483				MAY	2024	155	5					3811	3830		10.1007/s00704-024-04850-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-024-04850-9		FEB 2024											WOS:001153726300001

Seasonal changes in pH values in the intestine of fish from Lake Chany (West Siberia)	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												The pH values are determined in the digestive tract of nine fish species in Lake Chany (West Siberia). Seasonal changes in pH values are found along the intestine of fish. Intestinal pH values decrease in summer as the temperature rises and increase during the cold season as the temperature drops. The hypothesis has been advanced that temperature-dependent pH changes in the intestine may serve as a regulatory mechanism that maintains the activity of hydrolytic enzymes at the level required for successful digestive processes due to some adaptive modifications of the medium where these enzymes operate.

Ordination techniques (DCA, CCAs) and Monte Carlo permutation tests were used to identify the most important parameters controlling the chironomid distributions. Based on the lambda(1):lambda(2) ratios of the variables, the greatest potential for quantitative inferences was with hypolimnetic oxygen (lambda(1):lambda(2) = 0.767). Therefore, inference models for past late-winter hypolimnetic oxygen were developed using weighted-averaging partial least squares (WA-PLS) techniques. The best model used one WA-PLS component, with a cross-validated coefficient of determination (r(jack)(2)) of 0.72 and a root-incan-squared error of prediction (RMSEP) of 2.351 mg l(-1). The model was tested on two short-core sediment sequences. The results indicated that quantitative estimations of hypolimnetic oxygen changes provide a useful tool for palaeolinnnology and lake management in assessments of lake ecosystems, and in restoration projects in southern Finland.

Paleoclimate changes inferred from stable isotopes and magnetic properties of organic-rich lake sediments in Arctic Norway	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Stable isotope measures in organic matter are frequently used as indicators of past climate change. Although such analyses can provide valuable information, there is considerable uncertainty associated with studies of organic-rich sediments, especially those from Arctic lakes and bogs. We studied stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen, and magnetic properties in a sediment core from a small alkaline lake with a high sedimentation rate, Lake Nattmalsvatn, Norway. There is good correspondence among the different sediment variables during the late glacial, and they seemingly reflect major climate variations such as the Allerod Interstade and the Younger Dryas, as well as the transition into the current interglacial. During the early Holocene, however, these relationships are more complex and delta C-13 and delta N-15 values do not stabilize until similar to 7,500 cal year BP. A significant excursion in all variables occurs between 6,850 and 6,500 cal year BP and is interpreted to represent climate deterioration. Holocene delta C-13 values vary little and indicate that isotopically-depleted dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the lake, possibly influenced by methanotrophy and high pCO(2), dominated the lake's carbon cycle. Holocene delta N-15 is similarly muted, likely due to the availability of abundant dissolved nitrogen. Bulk organic matter is probably dominated by phytoplankton remains produced beneath the ice cover in late spring and during ice breakup when isotopically-depleted DIC, pCO(2) and ammonium availability were maximal. Thus, use of delta C-13 and delta N-15 as indicators of Holocene paleoclimate and paleoproductivity variation can be challenging in a lake such as Nattmalsvatn, where ice cover isolates the basin for large parts of the year, allowing dissolved respiratory gases to accumulate in the water column. In contrast, magnetic variables appear to better track climate variations. In particular, runoff-driven influx of minerogenic sediments shows high variability that can be attributed to regional changes in Holocene winter precipitation. The most striking shifts occur between 4,000 and 2,300 cal year BP.

Understanding the relative importance of multiple types of wetlands as habitats for waterbirds and the factors influencing their utilization could improve management effectiveness. During the wintering seasons of 2021-2022 and 2022-2023, we documented the distribution of Eurasian spoonbills (Platalea leucorodia), a wetland specialist, in the Yancheng National Nature Reserve (YNNR) and quantified the surrounding environments as influencing factors to assess the relationship between their habitat use patterns and environmental characteristics. Our results showed that spoonbills inhabit common seepweed (Suaeda glauca) marshes, reed (Phragmites australis) ponds, aquaculture ponds, and agricultural channels. Although natural wetlands supported a greater number of spoonbills in the YNNR, spoonbills were able to forage in artificial wetlands. The environmental features where the spoonbills were distributed were found to influence their habitat use, and the most important factor was water depth, followed by species richness and vegetation cover. These results demonstrated that spoonbills rely on both natural and artificial wetlands in the core and buffer zones of the YNNR. Our research thus underlined that conservation interventions of natural and artificial wetlands, such as controlling the water depth and diminishing human activities, might maximize the effects of total conservation outcomes for the Eurasian spoonbills, as well as for various coastal waterbirds with similar ecological requirements.

Long-term studies of water chemistry and zooplankton interactions in a submontane dam reservoir in variable hydrological years (dry, wet, average)	ECOHYDROLOGY & HYDROBIOLOGY												The differences in environmental parameters and zooplankton community were studied in the epilimnion of the Carpathian Dobczyce Dam Reservoir on the Raba River (southern Poland) between hydrologically dry (HD), average (HA) and wet (HW) years distinguished on the basis of mean annual flow for 20 0 0-2017. We found significant differences in water chemistry (conductivity, nutrients: P -tot, PO 4 3- , NH 4 + ) in the epilimnion between the studied hydrological years. The total density and dry weight of zooplankton and the density of Rotifera: Keratella quadrata (M & uuml;ller, 1786), Copepoda: Copepoda n. det. (immature stages), Cyclops strenuus Fischer, 1851, Eudiaptomus gracilis (Sars G.O., 1863) and Cladocera: Bosmina longirostris (O.F.M & uuml;ller, 1776), Daphnia cucullata G.O. Sars, 1862, and D. longispina (O.F.M & uuml;ller, 1776) were significantly higher in HA and HW years than in HD years. The highest densities of many Rotifera, Cladocera and Copepoda species were found in HA and HW years with high flows or floods in the river in spring or early summer. At these times, the epilimnion was rich in P -tot (diffuse pollution), considered as a limiting factor for algal growth in Carpathian reservoirs. The best Generalized Linear Models (GLM) for zooplankton density included 4-6 factors, among which P -tot, NO 3 - , and pH were always present. We found that river flows prevailing in a given year determine water chemistry and eutrophication processes, which has a significant impact on densities and dry weight of zooplankton communities in HD, HA and HW years.

Four sets of size-resolved aerosol samples were collected at a site on the edge of the Lake Eyre Basin (LEB), in the south-east dust transport pathway. Back trajectory analysis shows that three samples were sourced from the LEB (one during a rare winter dust storm), and one from coastal regions to the south. All samples were subjected to both ion beam analysis and ion chromatography. A Fe/Al ratio of 0.9 was found, consistent with results from our other campaigns to sites in the LEB, significantly higher than typical Northern Hemisphere values (similar to 0.45-0.6). This confirms the iron-rich character of central Australian soils.

In spite of a decreasing supply, there is at the same time an increase in nutrient concentrations, especially for P, but also for the suspended matter content in the fjord. Analyses af wind data from nearby lighthouses show that the frequency of strong winds from the SW (equal to the longest fetch) has gone up in the same period of time and that both the nutrients and suspended matter concentrations in the water column are well correlated with available wind energy and hence, with the possibilities for wave-induced resuspension of material from the fjord bottom. During a 6 month period, daily fluctuations of concentrations in the water column were measured in samples taken by automatic samplers at four stations with different exposures. Due to wave induced resuspension, the day to day variations were between 2-895 mg DW l(-1) of suspended matter, 0.2.-24.5 mg l(-1) of organic matter, 0.1-1.1 mg l(-1) of Total-N, and 0.01-0.18 mg l(-1) of Total-P. Fortnightly measurements of erosion rates at station bottoms showed that as much as 3 cm of the sediment surface were resuspended during periods of hard wind conditions. The resuspended particles had mode sizes of 30-40 mu, i.e. high sinking rates are assumed. The concentrations af suspended matter observed in the water column, however, were not below 40 mg DW l(-1) in 50% og the time, leading to a marked effect on light penetration in water.

Monitoring burbot movements between lentic and lotic habits and collection of demographic data (length, age, sex, and maturity) were used to answer the following questions in the Torrey Creek drainage of west-central Wyoming, USA: (a) is there plasticity in the life-history traits of the burbot population, (b) do Trail Lake origin and Torrey Creek origin burbot interchange during the spawning period, and (c) is there a difference in growth and age at sexual maturity between burbot captured in Trail Lake and Torrey Creek? Results indicated that burbot in Trail Lake and Torrey Creek exhibit plasticity in their life history traits. Directional movement of PIT-tagged burbot in Trail Lake and Torrey Creek was monitored nearly continuously by tandem stream-width antennas. Thirty-five percent of lentic-origin burbot migrated upstream into Torrey Creek, and 11% of lotic-origin burbot migrated downstream of the antennas near the Torrey Creek inlet to Trail Lake. Migratory activity of burbot was highest during the late winter and early spring at a time that coincided with spawning. Additionally, Torrey Creek-origin burbot were smaller and younger than Trail Lake-origin burbot. In addition to documenting migration, the sampling of small, sexually mature burbot in Torrey Creek suggests that stream-resident burbot reach maturity earlier than adfluvial and lacustrine burbot in Trail Lake. Furthermore, high catch rates of age-0 burbot indicate that Torrey Creek upstream from Trail Lake provides nursery habitat to the burbot population. Life history trait plasticity and spawning and nursery habitats documented in this study should be considered when selecting conservation actions for this unique burbot population.

J	Yu, Y; Song, JM; Li, XG; Duan, LQ				Yu Yu; Song Jinming; Li Xuegang; Duan Liqin			Geochemical records of decadal variations in terrestrial input and recent anthropogenic eutrophication in the Changjiang Estuary and its adjacent waters	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												Increasing eutrophication and seasonal anoxia in bottom water in the Changjiang Estuary and its adjacent waters has progressed in recent decades, caused by elevated anthropogenic N and P input. Sedimentary biogenic elements were investigated to determine whether the biogenic proxies could be used in paleo-environmental studies in an energetic estuary, as well as to reconstruct the histories of environmental changes in the East China Sea (ECS). Two Pb-210-dated cores from the coastal and offshore waters were analyzed for organic C (TOC) and its stable isotope (delta C-13), total N (TN), biogenic Si (BSi), total P (TP) and P species. In coastal sediment, the variations of P species, especially Fe-P, Al-P and detrital apatite P (Det-P), reflected the dry-wet oscillations in the Changjiang River for the past century, which has influenced the sediment grain size and terrestrial material input. Much lower BSi content (0.756%) at 16-22 cm likely recorded the pronounced decrease in silicate flux in the Changjiang River and its lower flow in the late 1980s. In offshore sediment, higher concentrations of TOC, TN, BSi, Ex-P, Fe-P and Lea-OP indicated higher primary productivity in response to the strong winter monsoons during the 1960s-1980s, and their 20-a fluctuations were in agreement with the decadal variations of the winter monsoon. Low contents and little variations of Al-P and Det-P indicated the slight influence of the terrestrial sediment input in offshore waters. The influence of human activities on the environment in recent decades has also been recorded in coastal sediment. Grain-size normalized concentrations of TOC, TN, TP, Ex-P, Fe-P and Lea-OP increased by 24%, 23%, 15%, 13% and 51% in the upper 16 cm of coastal sediment, indicating elevated P and N load and primary productivity since the 1990s. Elevated TN/TP ratios and decreased BSi/TOC recorded the changed nutrient structure and the decrease in the proportion of the diatom to phytoplankton community. However, the sediment record indicated that the eutrophication might actually have started from the end of the 20th century rather than the reported middle of 20th century. In contrast, biogenic elements in offshore sediment did not reflect disturbance by human activities. This study revealed that multi-nutrient proxies in sediment in the ECS could indicate natural environmental changes including runoff and the winter monsoon over the past century, as well as the influence of human activities in recent decades. Phosphorus species with distinct origins and biogeochemical behaviors could effectively reflect different aspects of past environmental conditions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Caputo, L; Alfonso, G; Givovich, A				Caputo, Luciano; Alfonso, Giuseppe; Givovich, Arturo			Limnological features of Laguna Teno (35° S, Chile): a high altitude lake impacted by volcanic activity	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												Laguna Teno (2549 m a.s.l.) is a high elevation oligo-mesotrophic lake located in the area of influence of the active Volcanic Complex Planchon-Peteroa (VCPP) in the central Chilean Andes. The most recent eruption of VCPP was in September 2010. This study compares limnological data registered in Laguna Teno during the summers of 2009 and 2011, pre- and post-eruptive periods of the VCPP activity respectively. In particular remarkable post-eruption changes of conductivity and slight changes for pH values in the water column of Laguna Teno were detected. In contrast no major variations of trophic parameters of water quality and plankton attributes were observed between the two summer periods. Phytoplankton was mainly represented by the biomass and chlorophylls attributable to diatoms, dinophytes and chlorophytes, with distinctive patterns of vertical segregation. Zooplankton was constituted by a very simple community comprising the copepod Boeckella gibbosa, the cladoceran Daphnia gr. pulex and a population of rotifers of the Hexarthra genus. This study represents the first limnological characterization of Laguna Teno and the first biogeographical report of a melanized population of the Daphnia pulex complex living in a deep high altitude Chilean lake. The limnological attributes of Laguna Teno, particularly the noticeable presence of large sized pigmented Daphnia in summer allow us to: i) infer the biological responses of Daphnia to extreme conditions; ii) support the hypothesis that Teno is currently a fishless lake. The latter presumption is consistent with the lethal effects on fish registered on the watershed of Teno and Claro rivers after the eruption of VCPP in 1991.

EFFECTS OF PHYTOPLANKTON	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Twelve species of submerged macrophytes occur now in Loch Leven [Scotland, United Kingdom] as compared with 23 in 1910. Only 4 are common: Chara aspera, Nitella opaca, Potamogeton filiformis and Zannichellia palustris. The more recently recorded algae and macrophytes, e.g., Cladophora sp., Enteromorpha sp., Potamogeton filiformis and Z. palustria all indicate cultural enrichment. During the summer months of 1972 and 1973 there were high phytoplankton densities, mainly composed of Anabaena spp., developing apparently as a result of concentrations of phosphate-P greater than 0.05 mg 1-1; these were correlated with reduced biomass values for the dominant submerged marcophyte P. filiformis. In the summer of 1974 there were low levels of phosphate-P and chlorophyll a in the water and P. filiformis grew well. There is some evidence that the inhibitory effect of algal blooms may operate through an attenuation of irradiance and an increase in pH.																			0022-0477	1365-2745					1977	65	1					175	186		10.2307/2259072	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2259072													WOS:A1977CY60600014

Such an analysis is important not only because of the economic and recreational importance of the lakes, but in an effort to relate the regional circulation types to the broader-scale modes of atmospheric circulation, such as that forced by Fl Nino (ENSO). In this study, rotated principal components analysis (RPCA) is performed on the monthly mean sea-level pressure field around the Great Lakes basin, and in a separate analysis, on the mean 700 hPa field in eastern North America. An average-linkage clustering algorithm is applied to the RPCA scores to classify the monthly surface circulation in the Great Lakes region and the 700 hPa circulation over eastern North America. The classification is used to determine whether the various categories of regional circulation patterns are coincident with distinct hemispheric-scale flow regimes. To do this, indices of the modes of variability in some of the most well-known atmospheric teleconnections during months that fall within each circulation mode are subjected to ANOVA tests by cluster. Results suggest that the regional atmosphere over the Great Lakes basin undergoes long-term shifts in preferred modes of circulation. Furthermore, flow variability associated with the 700 hPa North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Pacific/North American (PNA) teleconnections are more strongly tied to variability in both the Great Lakes regional surface circulation and the 700 mb eastern North American flow regimes than is the ENSO-forced Southern Oscillation.

We summarize our scientific findings and the site's potential to support science exploration, testing of new technologies and science protocols within the framework of astrobiology research. Ladakh has several accessible, diverse, pristine and extreme environments at very high altitudes (3000-5700 m above sea level). These sites include glacial passes, sand dunes, hot springs and saline lake shorelines with periglacial features. We report geological observations and environmental characteristics (of astrobiological significance) along with the development of regolith-landform maps for cold high passes. The effects of the diurnal water cycle on salt deliquescence were studied using the ExoMars Mission instrument mockup: HabitAbility: Brines, Irradiance and Temperature (HABIT). It recorded the existence of an interaction between the diurnal water cycle in the atmosphere and salts in the soil (which can serve as habitable liquid water reservoirs). Life detection assays were also tested to establish the best protocols for biomass measurements in brines, periglacial ice-mud and permafrost melt water environments in the Tso-Kar region. This campaign helped confirm the relevance of clays and brines as interest targets of research on Mars for biomarker preservation and life detection.

Samples were taken monthly, from March 2010 to February 2011, from Geno hot spring (Bandar Abbas, Iran). The smallest sexually mature male and female individuals measured 21.1 and 15.1 mm and massed 0.15 and 0.06 g, respectively. The overall sex ratio (females/males) found to be 1.18. Monthly sex ratios suggested no significant differences, although females demonstrated significantly higher abundances than males at larger length classes. Gonadosomatic index and ovary condition suggested that species reproductive period lasts all year. Oocyte diameter ranged from 0.30 to 2.20 mm, with a mean of 1.15 +/- 0.49 mm. Monthly mean oocyte diameter were not significantly different, ranging from 0.99 (in February) to 1.22 mm (in December). Size composition analysis of oocyte diameter showed that females contained mature oocytes (> 1.1 mm) throughout year. Absolute fecundity of A. ginaonis ranged from 36 to 832 oocytes per individual (mean: 341 +/- 209 oocytes), varying considerably at given length and mass. Relative fecundity to total length fluctuated from 12 to 169 oocytes/mm (mean: 78 +/- 41 oocytes/mm) while relative fecundity to total mass varied from 61-526 oocytes/g (mean: 213 +/- 106 oocytes/g). A. ginaonis is an asynchronous, iteroparous spawner producing more than one oocyte clutch in a single reproductive season.					; Naderi, Mojtaba/ABA-5749-2020	Naderi, Mojtaba/0000-0002-2636-2611; 													0378-1909	1573-5133				MAY	2015	98	5					1365	1371		10.1007/s10641-014-0364-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-014-0364-2													WOS:000351518900012

Multiple carbon substrate utilization by bacteria at the sediment-water interface: seasonal patterns in a stratified eutrophic reservoir	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Sediment-water interfaces (SWIs) in lakes and reservoirs harbor diverse assemblages of heterotrophic bacteria that influence organic matter cycling. Seasonal reservoir mixing and stratification affect the rate and type of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) utilized by SWI bacteria, however these seasonal carbon utilization dynamics remain poorly understood. We conducted an exploratory multi-seasonal study using Biolog EcoPlates to measure SWI bacterial carbon substrate utilization rates (CSURs) and patterns in a monomictic eutrophic reservoir. Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to elucidate seasonal CSUR variation. Carbohydrate utilization was greatest during early (onset of) stratification and also was high during winter mixing. Amino acid utilization was greatest during late (prolonged) stratification. Carboxylic acids had greatest utilization during late stratification, but also had moderate to high utilization during all other seasons. Amines and polymers exhibited moderate utilization during all seasons. We related seasonal variation in these CSURs to SWI bacterial abundance, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and redox potential. Collectively these environmental variables accounted for 49.4-62.3% of the total substrate utilization variance by season. Several individual substrate CSURs were significantly (P < 0.05) positively and/or negatively correlated with individual environmental variables, with L-asparagine and putrescine exhibiting significant positive and negative correlations with every measured environmental variable. Lastly, seasonal changes in CSURs corresponded to various changes in SWI bacterial assemblage composition, with highest similarities among early stratification and autumnal overturn assemblages and lowest similarities among late stratification and winter mixing assemblages.

J	Franz, D; Koebsch, F; Larmanou, E; Augustin, J; Sachs, T				Franz, Daniela; Koebsch, Franziska; Larmanou, Eric; Augustin, Juergen; Sachs, Torsten			High net CO2 and CH4 release at a eutrophic shallow lake on a formerly drained fen	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Drained peatlands often act as carbon dioxide (CO2) hotspots. Raising the groundwater table is expected to reduce their CO2 contribution to the atmosphere and revitalise their function as carbon (C) sink in the long term. Without strict water management rewetting often results in partial flooding and the formation of spatially heterogeneous, nutrient-rich shallow lakes. Uncertainties remain as to when the intended effect of rewetting is achieved, as this specific ecosystem type has hardly been investigated in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) exchange. In most cases of rewetting, methane (CH4) emissions increase under anoxic conditions due to a higher water table and in terms of global warming potential (GWP) outperform the shift towards CO2 uptake, at least in the short term. Based on eddy covariance measurements we studied the ecosystem-atmosphere exchange of CH4 and CO2 at a shallow lake situated on a former fen grassland in northeastern Germany. The lake evolved shortly after flooding, 9 years previous to our investigation period. The ecosystem consists of two main surface types: open water (inhabited by submerged and floating vegetation) and emergent vegetation (particularly including the eulittoral zone of the lake, dominated by Typha latifolia). To determine the individual contribution of the two main surface types to the net CO2 and CH4 exchange of the whole lake ecosystem, we combined footprint analysis with CH4 modelling and net ecosystem exchange partitioning. The CH4 and CO2 dynamics were strikingly different between open water and emergent vegetation. Net CH4 emissions from the open water area were around 4-fold higher than from emergent vegetation stands, accounting for 53 and 13aEuro-gaEuro-CH(4)aEuro-m(-2)aEuro-a(-1) respectively. In addition, both surface types were net CO2 sources with 158 and 750aEuro-gaEuro-CO(2)aEuro-m(-2)aEuro-a(-1) respectively. Unusual meteorological conditions in terms of a warm and dry summer and a mild winter might have facilitated high respiration rates. In sum, even after 9 years of rewetting the lake ecosystem exhibited a considerable C loss and global warming impact, the latter mainly driven by high CH4 emissions. We assume the eutrophic conditions in combination with permanent high inundation as major reasons for the unfavourable GHG balance.					; S, T/AIC-1764-2022	Larmanou, Eric/0000-0002-6427-8859; Franz, Daniela/0000-0001-9261-4517; Sachs, Torsten/0000-0002-9959-4771													1726-4170	1726-4189					2016	13	10					3051	3070		10.5194/bg-13-3051-2016	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-3051-2016													WOS:000378354900013

Light scattering and Secchi depth in an oligotrophic lake: insights from an individual particle analysis technique	INLAND WATERS												Light-scattering attributes of particles of the upper waters of oligotrophic Skaneateles Lake, New York, were characterized monthly for the spring - fall interval of 2 years with scanning electron microscopy interfaced with automated image and X-ray analyses (SAX). SAX results were used to make forward estimates of the particulate scattering coefficients associated with 2 components (b(x)) of the overall particle population, minerogenic particles (b(m)) and diatoms (b(di)), through Mie theory calculations. Estimates of the third component, scattering by organic particles other than diatoms (b(o/nd)), were calculated as the residual of bulk measurements of the particulate scattering coefficient (b(p)) and the summation of bm and bdi. Regulation of Secchi depth (SD) in the lake by bp was documented, in the form of a strong (R-2 = 0.73) linear SD-1 - b(p) relationship. Variations in the summation (b(m) + b(di)) explained 66% of the dynamics of bp and 56% for SD-1. A 2-component partitioning of b(p) that incorporates the SAX-Mie-based values of b(m), and estimates of the contribution of all organic particulates with an empirical chlorophyll-a-based bio-optical model, failed to predict the b(p) dynamics but closed well on average for the entire study period. The SD-1 - b(p) relationship and the reported partitioning of bp were used to predict: (1) changes in bx from the study conditions that are consistent with a robust range of historic observations of SD, and (2) scenarios of management interest of levels of SD expected from hypothetical changes in b(x).

J	Gasse, F; Van Campo, E				Gasse, F; Van Campo, E			A 40,000-yr pollen and diatom record from Lake Tritrivakely, Madagascar, in the southern tropics	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Links between southern and northern hemisphere climates during the Late Quaternary are poorly known, partly due to the scarcity of continuous climatic records in the southern tropics. Pollen and diatom evidence from Lake Tritrivakely (19 degrees 47'S) provides information on vegetational and hydrological changes in the central highlands of Madagascar over the past 40,000 yr. Most of the record reflects natural environmental variability since humans arrived on the island ca. 2000 yr B.P. During glacial times, the migration of mountain plants toward lower altitudes is consistent with a temperature decrease and with reduced atmospheric CO2 levels. In the lake, a positive mean annual hydrologic balance, from 38,000 to 36,000 and from 17,500 to 9800 cal yr B.P., coincided with periods of decreasing summer insolation and preceded by several millennia lake rises in the northern tropics. A negative hydrologic budget during periods of maximum seasonal contrast in solar radiation is partly attributed to high summer evaporation rate. The last glacial maximum was cool and dry. The deglacial warming occurred in two steps. The first step, accompanied by an increase in wetness, occurred abruptly at ca. 17,000 cal yr B.P., about two millennia earlier than in the northern hemisphere. It is abundantly documented in southern terrestrial data. The second step, at 15,000 cal yr B.P., was in phase with the first major temperature change in the northern hemisphere.

Archaeological and spatial research of the Mirador-Calakmul area of Guatemala and Mexico has shown it to be a karst basin with geopolitical implications. Current research characterizes the karst landscapes of the Peten Plateau, maps the distribution of karst hydrologic features, and delineates the basin in geomorphological terms. To further this aim, multiple forms of remote sensing data including orthophotographs, a satellite Digital Elevation Model, satellite multispectral images, and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data have been integrated to interpret the karst features in the study area. Outcrop study and thin section analysis of the upper Buena Vista Formation document that the dominant lithologies are a shallow water algal boundstone interbedded with terrestrial caliche. Karst landforms have been mapped over the Peten Plateau and we identify five karst landscapes, the largest of which is a fluviokarst landscape dominated by karst valleys. We further map karst hydrologic features including seasonal swamps, dolines, intermittent lakes, intermittent streams, solution-enhanced fractures, and springs all of which are characteristic of drainage basins. Boundaries of the karst basin are mapped from multiple lines of evidence including distribution of the karst valleys, a line of springs along the western boundary of the fluviokarst landscape, and a surface drainage analysis. We capture and classify hydrologic data points and develop a regional groundwater map that indicates subsurface flow from east to west within the basin.

J	Tsugeki, NK; Urabe, J				Tsugeki, Narumi K.; Urabe, Jotaro			An experimental test of the ability of Daphnia galeata resting egg production in Lake Biwa	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												The Daphnia galeata population in Lake Biwa (Japan) had almost ceased producing resting eggs by the 1980s. To examine whether D. galeata had lost the ability to produce resting eggs, or if chemical contamination was inhibiting resting egg production, individuals collected in fall (November) and late winter (March), were reared in the laboratory. More than 50% of these D. galeata individuals produced resting eggs irrespective of the month of collection, when reared with food supplied at a level lower than that available during the maternal generation. The results reflect that D. galeata in Lake Biwa have a high ability to produce resting eggs when appropriate stimuli are provided. As chemical substances, such as endocrine disrupters, are known to inhibit resting egg production in Daphnia and these accumulate in lake sediments, we tested whether Daphnia individuals produce resting eggs when reared in sediment-conditioned lake water. In sediment-conditioned lake water, only a few Daphnia that were collected in March produced resting eggs, while 50% of the individuals collected in November produced resting eggs. Thus, D. galeata collected from Lake Biwa are able to produce resting eggs, but genetic variation likely leads to variation in resting egg production in the presence of chemical contaminants. These results suggest that the recent decrease in the resting egg production of Daphnia populations in Lake Biwa is mainly due to a decrease in the strength of the environmental queue that stimulates resting egg production rather than a genetic shift to strains that have a lower ability to produce resting eggs; yet, we cannot rule out the possibility that a chemical contamination plays a role in the decrease of resting egg production.					; Urabe, Jotaro/A-6256-2012; Tsugeki, Narumi/AAV-2862-2021	Tsugeki, Narumi/0000-0003-1236-906X; Urabe, Jotaro/0000-0001-5111-687X; 													1129-5767	1723-8633					2014	73	1					191	196		10.4081/jlimnol.2014.569	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2014.569													WOS:000338928300018

Medium Scale Field Indentation Tests (MSFIT) were conducted during the winters of 1996 and 1997. The purpose of the tests was to investigate ice loads and ice failure characteristics, and to establish a new method of estimating ice loads during ice - structure interactions. The tests consisted of ice indentation tests, tests on physical properties of ice sheets, and measurements of ice sheet deformation. The test site was located at Futamigaoka Harbor on Lake Notoro, Hokkaido, whose entrance faces the Sea of Okhotsk. This paper describes the results of ice sheet strain measurements using strain gages and the estimation of strain area during ice/vertical-sided-structure interactions obtained during a winter test in 1997.																			1098-6189		1-880653-36-2				1998							376	380																WOS:000075723400057

INTCAL, SHCAL, OR A MIXED CURVE? CHOOSING A 14C CALIBRATION CURVE FOR ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND PALEOENVIRONMENTAL RECORDS FROM TROPICAL SOUTH AMERICA	RADIOCARBON												Because the C-14 calibration curves IntCal and SHCal are based on data from temperate latitudes, it remains unclear which curve is more suitable for archaeological and paleoenvironmental records from tropical South America. A review of climate dynamics reveals a significant influx of Northern Hemisphere air masses and moisture over a substantial part of the continent during the South American Summer Monsoon (SASM). Areas affected by the SASM receive unknown amounts of input from both hemispheres, where an argument could be made for either curve. Until localized tree-ring data can resolve this, we suggest using a mixed calibration curve, which accounts for inputs from both hemispheres, as a third calibration option. We present a calibration example from a crucial period of environmental and cultural change in the southern Lake Titicaca. Given our current lack of data on past C-14 variation in South America, our calibrations and chronologies will likely change in the future. We hope this paper spurs new research into this topic and encourages researchers to make an informed and explicit choice of which curve to use, which is particularly relevant in research on past human-environmental relationships.

J	FOY, RH				FOY, RH			A COMPARISON OF CHLOROPHYLL-A AND CAROTENOID CONCENTRATIONS AS INDICATORS OF ALGAL VOLUME	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Carotenoid concentration, as measured by absorbance at 480 nm, was a better indicator of algal volume than chlorophyll a when the results from two lakes and laboratory studies on Oscillatoria agardhii var. isothrix Skuja were compared. The correlation between algal volume and carotenoid in White Lough (r=0.91) was significantly higher (0.001 < P < 0.01) than that between algal volume and chlorophyll a (r=0.77). The Lough Neagh correlation coefficient for algal volume with carotenoic (r=0.89) was only marginally stronger than that with chlorophyll a (r=0.87). 2. The relatively weak correlation between algal volume and chlorophyll a in White Lough was a result of a summer decline in the chlorophyll a content of O. agardhii var. isothrix, which dominated the phytoplankton. The chlorophyll a content of the phytoplankton was depressed by high summer daily totals of light hours received by the phytoplankton in White Lough of up to 14 h in comparison to a maximum value of 3.8 h in Lough Neagh, where no seasonal cycle of chlorophyll a content was evident. 3. Laboratory studies demonstrated that while chlorophyll a per unit algal volume of O. agardhii var. isothrix declined with increasing light dose, carotenoid content did not. Nitrogen and phosphorus limitation depressed the carotid content but to a lesser degree than was observed for chlorophyll a.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				APR	1987	17	2					237	250		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1987.tb01045.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1987.tb01045.x													WOS:A1987G595000004
J	Bozó, L; Németh, A; Csörgö, T				Bozo, Laszlo; Nemeth, Akos; Csorgo, Tibor			Long-term population changes of the Moustached Warbler (Acrocephalus melanopogon) in a Central Hungarian wetland habitat	ORNIS HUNGARICA												In recent years, the breeding populations of many migratory songbird species have declined in the Carpathian Basin. However, there may be significant differences between different geographical regions, as most species have a much higher chance of successful breeding in protected areas. This is also the case for the Moustached Warbler, one of the most habitat-specialist passerine. It colonises only perennial, unharvested reedbeds, therefore its conservation management is essential. We studied the population changes of this species between 2001 and 2022 at Lake Kolon in Izsak, based on bird ringing data from 10-24 July. Data of 12,817 ringed and 5,075 recaptured birds were used in the analyses. The annual capture rate decreased significantly during the study period. The proportion of juveniles was higher at higher water levels during the whole breeding season. In contrast, when looking at winter and first and second broods separately, water level had no effect on the juvenile/adult ratio. This is because the birds compensate for unsuccessful first broods by increasing the proportion of second and replacement broods. If the first broods are successful, the ratio of second and replacement broods will be lower. As reed management is practically non-existent in this area, the perennial reedbeds provide suitable nesting conditions for the species. Changes in the wintering sites may be responsible for the declining trend. Protection of the area is of particular importance for the conservation of the species.																			1215-1610	2061-9588				DEC 1	2023	31	2					89	98		10.2478/orhu-2023-0021	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/orhu-2023-0021													WOS:001163784800001

The effects of urban basin aerosol-boundary layer interactions on PM2.5 pollution during CAP events remain unclear. Intensive boundary layer observations in January 2021 and numerical models were used to investigate this issue in the semi-arid urban Lanzhou Basin of China. The results showed that CAPs formed because of the synoptic weather system that exacerbated the warming over the basin. The CAPs in this experiment were characterized by stronger temperature inversion (TI) layers in the vertical direction and lower relative humidity, lower wind speed, and weaker turbulence at the bottom of the basin compared to other conditions. The strong TI layers below the top of the basin inhibited the vertical dispersion of pollutants in the basin and concentrated the PM2.5 within a height of 0.3 km from the bottom of the basin. During CAP events, the proportion of elemental carbon in PM2.5 increased, whereas that of secondary inorganic species decreased. Aerosol absorption increased faster than scattering during CAP events. Therefore, the mean single scattering albedo decreased from 0.85 during non-CAP periods to 0.81 during CAP events. Radiosonde-sounding observations and numerical simulations indicated that aerosols accumulating in the lower basin heated the atmosphere during the daytime and facilitated boundary layer development via the "stove effect" (absorption aerosol heats lower atmosphere to promote boundary layer development). No significant "dome effect" (absorption aerosol heats the upper boundary layer to suppress boundary layer development) occurred during the two CAP events. These findings provide a theoretical basis for scientifically -guided PM2.5 pollution control in winter in isolated urban basins.

The abundance and stable carbon isotopic composition (delta C-13) of the same compounds were analyzed to assess changes in vegetation composition (C-3/C-4 plants) and density The delta D record reveals two wet periods that coincide with local maximum summer Insolation from 38 to 28 ka and 15 to 4 ka and that are separated by a less wet period during minimum summer Insolation Our data indicate that rainfall intensity during the rainy season throughout both wet humid periods was similar, whereas the length of the rainy season was presumably shorter during the last glacial than during the Holocene Additional dry intervals are identified that coincide with North Atlantic Heinrich stadials and the Younger Dryas interval, indicating that the West African monsoon over tropical northwest Africa is linked to both Insolation forcing and highlatitude climate variability. The delta C-13 record indicates that vegetation of the western Sahel was consistently dominated by C-4 plants during the past 44 ka, whereas C-3-type vegetation increased during the Holocene Moreover, we observe a gradual ending of the Holocene humid period together with unchanging ratio of C-3 to C-4 plants, indicating that an abrupt aridification due to vegetation feedbacks is not a general characteristic of this time interval.

Three geographical groups (north, central, south) were delineated from mean monthly water column temperatures for individual lakes. On a monthly basis, northern lakes were least similar to southern lakes, while central Florida lakes displayed greater affinity to the southern than to the northern lake group. Temperature differences between lake groups broke down during lake summer. Subtropical lakes have been defined tentatively as those Florida lakes south of 28.degree. latitude which possess warm monomictic circulation and a mean annual temperature of 24.2 .+-. 4.8.degree. C, with minimum water column temperature rarely < 14.degree. C and summer maxima rarely > 31.degree. C. While all lakes in Florida are clearly warm monomictic, annual cycling and productivity patterns may be influenced by inter-group differences in the timing and duration of water column circulation.

The analyses were carried out in 1998-2001, on 530 water samples collected at 14 sites selected in certain characteristic parts of the lake, taking into account the places were black cormorants dwelled. The results of the analyses were subjected to statistical elaboration by determining the coefficients of the correlation between the counts of each group of bacteria examined and some physico-chemical parameters of the lake's water. Most of the water samples (60%) taken from Dlugie Wigierskie Lake could be classified as water purity class one, i.e. very good quality, about 20-30% of the water samples as water purity class two (good quality). Only a small percentage of the water samples revealed a slight degree of contamination and those samples were considered to belong to water purity class three, i.e. waters of acceptable purity. More contaminated water samples were typically obtained near the inflow and outflow of the Dluzanka River, and around Ostrowek Island, as well as along the lake shores close to colonies of the black cormorant. Samples of the water which was microbiologically more contaminated were more often collected in the spring and summer, when the activity of waterfowl and other animals in and around the lake was more intensive. This was indicated by a low FC : FS ratio for most of the samples collected in those two seasons of the year. The low ratio of FC : FS in most water samples suggests that the lake water was polluted mainly by the waterfowl. The bacterial counts were most often positively correlated with the values of the chemical indicators which typically show contamination of surface waters: N-NH4, N-NO2 and P-total.

However, the airflow can not keep attaching to the floor and moves upwards by thermal buoyancy. The influence of relayed fans and low level exhausts on performance of attachment ventilation under heating mode was explored. One/two relayed fans and five dimensionless exhaust heights were investigated. Performance evaluating index include vertical temperature gradient, temperature efficiency, predicted mean vote (PMV), predicted percentage of dissatisfied (PPD) and Draught risk (DR). Simulation results showed that relayed fans and low level exhausts effectively increase the attachment length of warm air lake in winter. Operation of relayed fans reduces vertical temperature difference, maintaining the head and foot temperature difference less than 3 degrees C . Low level exhausts effectively increase occupant zone temperature, reduce airflow short circuit and improve temperature efficiency. The operation of relayed fans slightly increase the temperature efficiency under high level exhausts. Two relayed fans decrease the temperature efficiency under low level exhausts. Better performance ca n be achieved by using only one relayed fan.

The role of bioirrigation in sediment phosphorus dynamics and blooms of toxic cyanobacteria in a temperate lagoon	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE												A 3-D coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical/ecological model was developed and validated for the coastal Gippsland Lakes system, Australia, to explore the importance of bioirrigation on sediment phosphorus dynamics and the subsequent effects on the formation of summer blooms of Nodularia spumigena. Bottom water phosphorus concentrations and sediment phosphorus fluxes were most accurately simulated with bioirrigation implemented into the model. Further model simulations showed that bioirrigation selectively increased the flux of phosphorus relative to nitrogen leading to sediment N:P release ratios as low as 2. High summer phosphorus levels controlled the duration, size and severity of N. spumigena blooms; however, temperature and salinity were the primary factors that determined bloom formation and location. An assessment of sensitivity to model complexity identified that the model could only reproduce the observed N. spumigena bloom size when bioirrigation was implemented, highlighting the ecological importance of bioirrigation in phosphorus cycling and cyanobacteria bloom dynamics.

Systematic analyses for major and trace elements were conducted of water samples collected spatially and with depth in the lake in different seasons. Overall, Lake Texoma waters are characterized by Na-Ca-Cl-SO4-type waters with spatial distribution shifting from Na-Cl type to Ca-SO4 type from the Red River arm to the main lake and to the Washita River arm. In addition, vertical and seasonal variations in major and trace elements concentrations indicate major elements in the lake are mainly controlled by different bedrock weathering from the two river systems. Trace elements that exhibit different distribution patterns to the major species are associated with variable sources such as river inflow, summer stratification effects, biological effects and anthropogenic activities. In Lake Texoma, differential inflow volumes and summer stratification are principal factors controlling the variation and geochemistry of lake waters and mixing dynamics.					; Leybourne, Matthew/AAA-9340-2019; Klenzing, Jeff/E-2406-2011; Olariu, Cornel/A-2474-2010; Sun, Li/NZN-6716-2025	Olariu, Cornel/0000-0003-2837-4664; Klenzing, Jeff/0000-0001-8321-6074; Leybourne, Matthew/0000-0002-2361-6014; 													1467-7873	2041-4943				FEB	2015	15	1					12	26		10.1144/geochem2013-214	http://dx.doi.org/10.1144/geochem2013-214													WOS:000349372500002

In this study, we utilize a combination of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), and precipitation data to investigate the response of TWS on the TP to extreme climate changes, with a focus on seasonal and interannual variations. Our findings reveal that the first Common Mode Component (1st CMC) extracted from GNSS coordinate time series exhibits strong interannual fluctuations. Additionally, both GNSS and GRACE-inferred TWS demonstrate noticeable anomalous changes during the 2015/2016 period. The estimated periods of the 1st CMC of GNSS and GRACE-inferred TWS are approximately 5 and 7 years, respectively. Both reach a minimum during the extreme climate event in 2015/2016. Furthermore, we investigate the spatial variation of summer precipitation before and after the extreme drought event on the TP. It reveals that the inflection point of TWS occurs approximately 1 year prior to the drought event, suggesting a consistent spatial propagation process between precipitation and TWS. This indicates that the changes of TWS during this drought event were primarily influenced by precipitation. Finally, we evaluate the response of 12 sub-basins on the TP to the drought event that occurred in 2015/2016. The regions experiencing significant abnormal fluctuations in TWS are mainly located in inner and northeastern plateau. These regions show rapid upward changes in the TWS and demonstrate a strong spatial consistency with summer precipitation.					; Zhang, Xiaohong/L-7412-2019	Xiao, Yixin/0009-0007-2047-0826; Pan, Yuanjin/0000-0002-9496-346X; Jiao, Jiashuang/0000-0002-7915-0575; 													1009-5020	1993-5153				MAY 4	2025	28	3					1434	1449		10.1080/10095020.2024.2331553	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10095020.2024.2331553		MAR 2024											WOS:001203293900001
J	Rakocevic, J				Rakocevic, Jelena			SUMMER ASPECT OF PHYTOPLANKTON COMMUNITIES IN SOME MONTENEGRIN LAKES: ARE THERE CHANGES AFTER MORE THAN TWO DECADES?	ARCHIVES OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Qualitative and quantitative phytoplankton compositions of 10 Montenegrin lakes were investigated in the summer of 2007. The obtained results were compared with a previous study-period that was undertaken two decades ago. In the first period, diatoms numerically dominated the phytoplankton community in all studied lakes, while in the second period, the same was observed only in three of the ten lakes; in other studied lakes the relative contributions of green algae, dinoflagellates and/or cyanobacteria increased, while the contribution of diatoms decreased. The shift observed in phytoplankton composition and diversity in some of the studied lakes indicates an increase in the trophic level over the two decades. The sustainable management plan of the aquatic ecosystems in Montenegro should include the establishment of an environmental monitoring system in order to record any alterations that may take place in water quality.

J	WEISNER, SEB				WEISNER, SEB			LONG-TERM COMPETITIVE DISPLACEMENT OF TYPHA-LATIFOLIA BY TYPHA-ANGUSTIFOLIA IN A EUTROPHIC LAKE	OECOLOGIA												This study follows the outcome of long-term competition between a broad-leaved and a narrow-leaved Typha species, T. latifolia and T. angustifolia respectively, in a eutrophic lake. The lake was bordered by a zone of T. latifolia, at one location interrupted by a T. angustifolia stand. Distributional changes of the T. angustifolia stand and the adjacent zone of T. latifolia were measured on aerial photographs (less-than-or-equal-to 13 years) and along ground-level transects (6 years). A second stand of T. angustifolia was established with transplanted ramets within a formerly homogeneous zone of T. latifolia, and displacement between the two species was measured along ground-level transects after 6 years. Differences between the species in shoot performance were investigated to help explain the relative competitive abilities of the two Typha species. T. angustifolia expanded at the expense of T. latifolia at all water depths where both species occurred, except in very shallow water. Expansion rates suggest that T. angustifolia was not affected by the presence of T. latifolia in water depths exceeding 0.25 m. The Typha species were significantly negatively associated according to rank correlations of shoot densities, and changes of shoot densities, along the transects. These results suggest that T. angustifolia is competitively superior to T. latifolia, contradicting earlier studies. The higher competitive ability of T. angustifolia is consistent with its having taller shoots and a higher standing crop in early summer. Further, shoot height distributions indicated a closer integration of shoot emergence during spring in T. angustifolia than in T. latifolia. A high leaf area/shoot weight ratio suggest that T. latifolia may instead be relatively fast-growing, achieving competitive superiority over narrower-leaved Typha species during a transient period after simultaneous seedling establishment.

J	Urrutia, J; Herrera, C; Custodio, E; Jódar, J; Medina, A				Urrutia, Javier; Herrera, Christian; Custodio, Emilio; Jodar, Jorge; Medina, Agustin			Groundwater recharge and hydrodynamics of complex volcanic aquifers with a shallow saline lake: Laguna Tuyajto, Andean Cordillera of northern Chile	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Estimating groundwater recharge in arid regions with seasonal snow cover, as in the Andean Altiplano of northern Chile, is important for sustainable development policies and the effective management of scarce resources in a high water demanding zone, as fragile ecosystems depends on a stable water contribution. This research aims to evaluate and quantify rainfall and snowfall contribution to aquifer recharge while assessing the factors that control the hydrodynamics in such areas, based in the knowledge of the better documented Tuyajto Lake in the Tuyajto catchment/basin. The modeling framework involves an energy balance of the snow cover, a soil water balance and a groundwater flow and chloride transport model. The basin average annual recharge is about 23% of average precipitation. Snowmelt contribution to recharge is important at altitudes above 4700 m a.s.l. during September, while rainfall is more important in February and March, during short intense precipitation events. The hydraulic conductivity of ignimbrites and other volcanic formations are the most important hydrogeological parameters controlling lake level and spring flow rates, while albedo and snowpack surface roughness length on the energy balance causes the greatest variation of lake level. Evaporation is the process controlling the variability of the lake level, as aquifer contribution remains relatively constant and springs flow variability is not enough to cause the observed variations, except during November. Possible buried salts deposits on the eastern edges of Pampa Colorada and Tuyajto Lake, together with volcanic HCl contribution, justify the high measured groundwater chloride concentrations. A recharge 2-3 higher than the current one is necessary to justify a lake level 40 m above its modern value during the Last Glacial period, giving insight into past hydrological changes in the basin due to climate variability. The knowledge gained can be applied to other high altitude volcanic basins with seasonal snow cover. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Notes on the Summer Life History Traits of the Non-Native Pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus) (Linnaeus, 1758) in a High-Altitude Artificial Lake	DIVERSITY-BASEL												In the present study, the biology of the pumpkinseed Lepomis gibbosus in the artificial lake of Aoos, located in northwestern Greece, was investigated. The samplings of the pumpkinseed were conducted from the shore using a portable electrofishing device over a 4-month period (July 2021-October 2021). A total of 581 specimens were caught, with an average length of 62 mm. The sex ratio of female to male was estimated to be 1.0:1.7, and the percentage of mature specimens was estimated for all of the months to be above 52%, matching the highest percentage in July (57.4%). The b value of the length-weight relationship ranged from 3.16 in September to 3.31 in July. The value of the L infinity and K was estimated to be equal to 119 mm and 0.36 years 1, respectively, and the value of phi' was equal to 3.707. The total mortality was estimated to be equal to 1.63 +/- 0.48 y (-1) (R-2 = 0.96), and the natural and fishing mortalities were 0.83 and 0.80, respectively. The maximum age was 6 years, and the theoretical maximum age was 8 years. In the current study, the value of the L infinity was estimated to be near the European average but significantly lower than the North American one, whereas the value of the K was slightly higher than the European average. The small size of the specimens obtained in Aoos Springs was most likely owed to the combined impact of the investigated lake's high altitude and low food availability, resulting in a limited factor for species expansion.					; Moutopoulos, Dimitrios K/I-7680-2015; Moutopoulos, Dimitrios/I-7680-2015; Katselis, George/ABK-5111-2022	Katselis, George/0000-0001-7807-5836; Moutopoulos, Dimitrios K/0000-0001-5873-9893; Douligeri, Alexandra/0000-0003-0069-9934; 														1424-2818				AUG	2023	15	8							910	10.3390/d15080910	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d15080910													WOS:001055262300001

The diet of Mustela erminea L. in the Magadan oblast	CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY												The study describes the diet of Mustela erminea L. in the Magadan oblast. The major component is Clethrionomys voles in the oblast, C. rufocanus in the Sea of Okhotsk area and C. rutilus in the basin of the Kolyma River. In winter the percentage of mammals declines by about 20%. The stoat compensates for the lack of voles by scavenging fish collected from the beds of ephemeral lakes and streams. Birds, insects, and plant foods are minor components of the stoat's diet.																			1995-4255					FEB	2012	5	1					110	114		10.1134/S1995425512010158	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1995425512010158													WOS:000300491300015

Fine-grained lacustrine sediments of Eocene age from northeastern China represent an excellent archive to study long-term environmental and climatic changes at high-resolution. The Huadian Basin is a Cenozoic, fault-bounded basin in Jilin Province, northeastern China. Though small in area, it contains numerous oil shale- and coal-bearing layers, which provide an abundant Middle to Late Eocene palynoflora. Eighty-five palynomorph genera and one hundred palynomorph species were identified in the Huadian Formation, allowing to distinguish 4 palynozones. The nearest living relatives of the recovered palynomorph taxa suggest the presence of subtropical evergreen and deciduous broad-leaved forests during deposition of the Huadian Formation. Using the coexistence approach (CA), we calculated seven paleoclimatic parameters, which indicate a subtropical warm and humid climate with a mean annual temperature above 13.6 degrees C and a mean annual precipitation of at least 887 mm. However, the climate became cooler and drier during the transition from the lower Oil Shale Member to the upper Carbonaceous Shale Member. Palaeoclimatic data from the various Middle and Late Eocene basins of northeastern China (i.e., the Huadian, Fushun, Yilan, Hunchun and Jishu basins) were compared with data from North American and European basins. Middle Eocene climate in the Northern Hemisphere was generally warm and humid, and the mean annual temperature and precipitation in northeastern China were similar to those in North America, though slightly lower than those of Europe. Similar trends in temperature and precipitation on different continents support the existence of a global Mid-Eocene cooling event. This paper is the first systematic study of Middle to Late Eocene seasonality in the Huadian Basin. Our results show an apparent differentiation in both temperature and precipitation between summer and winter, supporting the view that the East Asian Monsoon was established in northeastern China already during the Middle to Late Eocene. This Middle and Late Eocene monsoon was likely driven by the development of Pacific trade winds and an alternating, seasonal high- and low-pressure system over Siberia. The climatic changes observed in our dataset, especially the precipitation changes, appear to have played an important role in controlling oil shale formation in the Huadian Basin. A warmer and more humid climate, with abundant precipitation and high subsidence rates, formed a deeper Huadian depositional lake. High productivity and stable stratification provided the abundant organic matter and favorable preservation conditions necessary for oil shale accumulation.																			0031-0182	1872-616X				DEC 1	2018	510				SI		63	77		10.1016/j.palaeo.2017.11.036	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2017.11.036													WOS:000452585100008
J	O'Brien, H				O'Brien, Harvey			Creation Myth: The Imagining of the Gothic Imagination in the Diodati Triptych: Gothic (1986), Haunted Summer (1988), and Remando al viento (1988)	GOTHIC STUDIES												This article argues that amid the slasher carnage, three 1980s gothic films representing the literary imagination of Frankenstein attempted to proffer a vision of horror rooted in creation rather than death. In so doing they reinvigorate the radical roots of horror as a challenge to the status quo: a reconfiguration of life into forms which awaken fears as characters face precarious destinies haunted by their past. Ken Russell's Gothic (1986), Ivan Passer's Haunted Summer (1988), and Gonzalo Suarez's Remando al viento / Rowing with the Wind (1988) all depict Mary Shelley facing personal and social challenges from her (male) peers including Percy Shelley, Lord Byron, and John Polidori. Arguably it is Mary who will in time emerge as an even more enduring literary voice, evinced by the fact of her being the protagonist of these films. During the Summer at Villa Diodati on the shores of Lake Geneva where each of these authors sought to create stories of horror, the films imagine the psychosexual power games and intellectual debates which surrounded these literary conjurations. All three films also depict an intrusion of the supernatural as Mary's monster actually manifests in the liminal space between waking and dreaming. Though wildly different in tone and affect, all three films represent a Gothicism (or an adjacent Gothic allusion) distinct from either the nostalgic or the dismissive deployment of its tropes in other genre films at the time and in so doing raise questions about 1980s cinema and culture more broadly.																			1362-7937	2050-456X				JUL	2022	24	2			SI		118	136		10.3366/gothic.2022.0129	http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/gothic.2022.0129													WOS:000965886700002
J	Simon, S; Simon-Gáspár, B; Anda, A				Simon, Szabina; Simon-Gaspar, Brigitta; Anda, Angela			Carbon dioxide emission and its impacting factor from goldenrod (Solidago canadensis) and bulrush (Typha angustifolia) decomposition during the winter period	ECOHYDROLOGY & HYDROBIOLOGY												Leaf litter decomposition in solution is an important part of the carbon cycle. When leaf litter is deposited in water, the decomposition process takes place, releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. In Hungary, the goldenrod and bulrush are spreading over increasing areas along lakes and rivers, including the shores of Lake Balaton. The primary role of the Kis-Balaton wetland is to retain inorganic nutrients, thereby improving the water quality of Lake Balaton. As the water movement in this area is not very intensive and the water retention time is long, carbon dioxide emissions of parts of decomposing plants can be higher in this area. We set up a microcosm experiment in a climate chamber to determine the carbon dioxide emissions from the decomposition of goldenrod and bulrush leaves and stems in winter when information about the process is limited. Due to short investigation time, the difference in the impact of temperatures on decomposition of the studied plants was restricted to leaves only. In the study, significant difference was obtained for the plant species and the plant parts. The carbon dioxide increments ranged from 46.7 (p < 0.001) to 54.5% (p < 0.001) in every plant treatment related to control one. Changes in water temper-ature are reflected in carbon dioxide release with a minor time delay. The results showed that the decomposition of plant parts in water during winter contributes to the increase of carbon dioxide emissions from shallow water bodies, such as the Kis-Balaton wetland.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

Ya; Umanskaya, M., V			Bacterial Diversity in Attached Communities of a Cold High- Sulfide Water Body in European Russia	MICROBIOLOGY												Bacterial diversity in attached communities of the anoxic part of the Solodovka wetland (Samara region, Russia), which feeds on cold karst springs with a high (>3 mM) sulfide content was studied using high-throughput sequencing of the variable regions V3-V4 of 16S rRNA gene. The sequences were grouped into 370 operational taxonomic units (OTUs); the OTU number per sample varied within a broad range, from 52 to 277. Taxonomic diversity in the samples depended on mat type, temperature, and sulfide concentration. The highest diversity was found in typical soft cyanobacterial mats; bacterial diversity in hard microbialites was much lower. Phototrophic bacteria formed the basis of all studied communities. In the typical mats, cyanobacteria prevailed, accompanied by phototrophic Chloroflexales, the latter being responsible for 7-13% of the total number of sequences. Hard microbialites and the mat developing at the highest sulfide concentration were characterized by low representation of these taxa and a high proportion of phototrophic Proteobacteria and Chlorobiaceae. Organisms of the sulfur cycle, Desulfobacterota and Campylobacterota, predominated in the chemotrophic part of the communities. While the organisms with fermentative metabolism and facultative chemolithotrophs were represented by a large number of OTUs, they were minor in abundance, and the sequences of the phyla Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria, which are usually widespread in oxic aquatic ecosystems have not been found. In general, the chemotrophic part of the studied communities strongly resembled the attached communities from cave streams and communities of various underground aquifers. Their phototrophic component was formed relatively independently of the chemotrophic one with the participation of the surrounding surface microbiota. The sequences most similar to some of the most abundant OTUs in the Solodovka wetland originated from the chemocline of stratified lakes, including meromictic ones.

Summer coastal rookeries and perspectives of the Baikal seal (Pusa sibirica) population in the conditions of the global warming	BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY												Based on the secondary literature, a retrospective characterization of the climate in the Baikal region, starting from the end of the Pleistocene, is given. According to satellite monitoring data, the characteristics of the ice regime of the Lake Baikal in the conditions of climate warming are presented. Moreover, we briefly discuss the impact of climate change on the ecology and biology of the Baikal seal (Pusa sibirica Gm.). Using video materials obtained online at one of the main island coastal rookeries of seals (on the island of Tonkyi, the archipelago of the Ushkany Islands, Lake Baikal) in 2011-2017, the dependence of the number of seals hauled out on the lake level and the peculiarities of the fishing regime was determined (the survey was conducted from May-June to October). A direct relationship was determined between the relative number of animals that had a moulting delay and the ice regime of a given year: the longer the floating ice in the northern part of Lake Baikal remained, the more numerous were the first approaches of seals to the studied rookery and the greater was the proportion of moulting individuals. It is reasonable to assume that the main reason for the Baikal seal to come ashore is not prolongued moulting time, but a physiological need for sunlight, which has a healing effect on the body of animals that lack solar radiation in winter. In general, climate warming has a negative impact on the state of the Baikal seal population. The available paleoclimatic reconstructions of the Holocene indicate that the population of the Baikal seal has experienced a lot of climate changes in its history. Nevertheless, if the current trends of climatic changes persist until the end of the 21st century, the ecology and biology of the seal will drastically change (up to the beginning of terrestrial reproduction), and the population will significantly decrease. However, the Baikal seal as a species would remain.					; Vladimir, Fialkov/AAD-4361-2022; Борисович, Александр/ABA-4085-2020	Kupcinskii, Aleksandr/0000-0001-8884-8636; 													2519-8513	2520-2529					2021	29	4					387	392		10.15421/012149	http://dx.doi.org/10.15421/012149													WOS:000739431800011

Evaluation of drought propagation in an ensemble mean of large-scale hydrological models	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Hydrological drought is increasingly studied using large-scale models. It is, however, not sure whether large-scale models reproduce the development of hydrological drought correctly. The pressing question is how well do large-scale models simulate the propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought? To answer this question, we evaluated the simulation of drought propagation in an ensemble mean of ten large-scale models, both land-surface models and global hydrological models, that participated in the model intercomparison project of WATCH (WaterMIP). For a selection of case study areas, we studied drought characteristics (number of droughts, duration, severity), drought propagation features (pooling, attenuation, lag, lengthening), and hydrological drought typology (classical rainfall deficit drought, rain-to-snow-season drought, wet-to-dry-season drought, cold snow season drought, warm snow season drought, composite drought). Drought characteristics simulated by large-scale models clearly reflected drought propagation; i.e. drought events became fewer and longer when moving through the hydrological cycle. However, more differentiation was expected between fast and slowly responding systems, with slowly responding systems having fewer and longer droughts in runoff than fast responding systems. This was not found using large-scale models. Drought propagation features were poorly reproduced by the large-scale models, because runoff reacted immediately to precipitation, in all case study areas. This fast reaction to precipitation, even in cold climates in winter and in semi-arid climates in summer, also greatly influenced the hydrological drought typology as identified by the large-scale models. In general, the large-scale models had the correct representation of drought types, but the percentages of occurrence had some important mismatches, e.g. an overestimation of classical rainfall deficit droughts, and an underestimation of wet-to-dry-season droughts and snow-related droughts. Furthermore, almost no composite droughts were simulated for slowly responding areas, while many multi-year drought events were expected in these systems. We conclude that most drought propagation processes are reasonably well reproduced by the ensemble mean of large-scale models in contrasting catchments in Europe. Challenges, however, remain in catchments with cold and semi-arid climates and catchments with large storage in aquifers or lakes. This leads to a high uncertainty in hydrological drought simulation at large scales. Improvement of drought simulation in large-scale models should focus on a better representation of hydrological processes that are important for drought development, such as evapotranspiration, snow accumulation and melt, and especially storage. Besides the more explicit inclusion of storage in large-scale models, also parametrisation of storage processes requires attention, for example through a global-scale dataset on aquifer characteristics, improved large-scale datasets on other land characteristics (e.g. soils, land cover), and calibration/evaluation of the models against observations of storage (e.g. in snow, groundwater).					; Van Loon, Anne/ADL-7862-2022	Van Loon, Anne F./0000-0003-2308-0392; van Lanen, Henny/0000-0001-9226-3921													1027-5606	1607-7938					2012	16	11					4057	4078		10.5194/hess-16-4057-2012	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-16-4057-2012													WOS:000311514600010
J	Hongve, D				Hongve, D			Production of dissolved organic carbon in forested catchments	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Leaf litter is an important source of natural dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in forested catchments. Rainwater percolating through fresh litter obtains higher concentrations of DOC and colour than from older forest floor material and organic soils. Chemical characterisation using DOC fractionation and tests of biodegradability show that natural litter percolates contain significant fractions of coloured and highly refractory hydrophobic acids (humic substances) and variable fractions of biodegradable compounds. Deciduous leaf litter imparts high DOC concentrations in the autumn, while coniferous litter and organic soils release DOC more evenly. Leaching from fresh deciduous litter may explain the seasonality in the concentration of DOC in discharge from forested catchments. Countrywide Norwegian data show very poor relationships between occurrences of mires in the catchment of lakes and water colour. High concentrations of DOC may occur in lakes where the catchment has a high proportion of surface runoff due to thin or impermeable soils or swamp areas. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Jalili, S; Hamidi, SA; Ghanbari, RN				Jalili, Sheida; Hamidi, Sajad Ahmad; Ghanbari, Reza Namdar			Climate variability and anthropogenic effects on Lake Urmia water level fluctuations, northwestern Iran	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL												Lake Urmia, the second largest hyper-saline lake on Earth, has recently experienced a dramatic water-level reduction. This could have been caused by climate change or other anthropogenic effects; however it could also be a part of natural climate variability. To explore the hydroclimate variability effect on the lake water level, two teleconnections were considered for analysis: the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Spectral and coherency analyses were used to recognize the frequency components and the relationship between the teleconnections and the lake water-level fluctuations. The results show that the recent water level fall and the rise of water level in 1994-1999 cannot be explained by the natural periodic behavior of Lake Urmia. The inter-decadal water-level oscillations are coherent with NAO and SOI components of such oscillations. The anthropogenic effect on the lake water level was also explored using non-parametric trend analysis. The results show that the lake water level has a positive trend between 1966 and 1995, but the trend is not significant at a 95% confidence level. However, the trend between 1995 and 2009 is negative and it is significant at a 99% confidence interval. This study shows that the very recent fall in water level is due to anthropogenic impacts rather than natural variability.					; Hamidi, Sajad/KPA-4997-2024	Hamidi, Sajad Ahmad/0000-0003-4761-5750; 													0262-6667	2150-3435				AUG	2016	61	10					1759	1769		10.1080/02626667.2015.1036757	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2015.1036757													WOS:000380065500001

The succession of blooms of heterocystous forms followed by colonial coccoid species is similar to that found in the epilimnion of many temperate eutrophic lakes that stratify in summer, though the Yorkshire lake is too shallow for thermal or chemical stratification to occur. The periodicity is explained by the long retention time of the lake, variable column stability and summer N deficiency, conditions that favor the larger self-regulating cyanophytes. Cell degeneration, heterocyst frequencies and akinete differentiation are discussed in relation to nitrate-N concentrations and population maxima. In the decline phase after a bloom, heterocystous forms show cell degeneration and akinete formation whereas the coccoid forms undergo sinking with little cell degeneration since intact colonies are necessary for overwintering in the sediment. Forty percent of the akinetes of A. solitaria germinate shortly after maturation; these akinetes probably serve to remove the alga from the upper and potentially damaging layers of the lake rather than persisting as long-term resting spores. Germinated akinetes may well constitute the major overwintering stage. [The 7 other species were A. spiroides, A. flos-aquae, Gloeotrichia echinulata, Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, Microcystis aeruginosa, Gomphosphaeria naegeliana and Oscillatoria agardhii].																			0007-1617						1984	19	3					245	257		10.1080/00071618400650271	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00071618400650271													WOS:A1984TN58700006

Ice thickness and bed topography of Jostedalsbreen ice cap, Norway	EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA												We present an extensive dataset of ice thickness measurements from Jostedalsbreen ice cap, mainland Europe's largest glacier. The dataset consists of more than 351 000 point values of ice thickness distributed along similar to 1100 km profile segments that cover most of the ice cap. Ice thickness was measured during field campaigns in 2018, 2021, 2022 and 2023 using various ground-penetrating radar (GPR) systems with frequencies ranging between 2.5 and 500 MHz. A large majority of the ice thickness observations were collected in spring using either snowmobiles (90 %) or a helicopter-based radar system (8 %), while summer measurements were carried out on foot (2 %). To ensure accessibility and ease of use, metadata were attributed following the GlaThiDa dataset (GlaThiDa Consortium, 2020) and follow the FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) guiding principles. Our findings show that glacier ice of more than 400 m thickness is found in the upper regions of large outlet glaciers, with a maximum ice thickness of similar to 630 m in the accumulation area of Tunsbergdalsbreen. Thin ice of less than 50 m covers narrow regions joining the central part of Jostedalsbreen with its northern and southern parts, making the ice cap vulnerable to break-up with future climate warming. Using the point values of ice thickness as input to an ice thickness model, we computed 10 m grids of ice thickness and bed topography that cover the entire ice cap. From these distributed datasets, we find that Jostedalsbreen (458 km(2) in 2019) has a present (similar to 2020) mean ice thickness of 154 +/- 22 m and an ice volume of 70.6 +/- 10.2 km(3). Locations of depressions in the map of bed topography are used to delineate potential future lakes, consequently providing a glimpse of the landscape if the entire Jostedalsbreen melts away. Together, the comprehensive ice thickness point values and ice-cap-wide grids serve as a baseline for future climate change impact studies at Jostedalsbreen.

J	Shi, Q; Xue, PF				Shi, Qi; Xue, Pengfei			Impact of Lake Surface Temperature Variations on Lake Effect Snow Over the Great Lakes Region	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												A high-resolution three-dimensional Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is used to investigate the coupled impact of lake surface temperature (LST) and surface wind on the lake effect snow (LES) over the Great Lakes region. A set of twin WRF simulations, with and without resolving LST spatial variations in the model's surface boundary condition, is performed to quantify the impact of LST variation on LES. Both observations and model results reveal a positive correlation between the downwind LST gradient and surface wind convergence over the Great Lakes region. Furthermore, model simulations show that resolving the spatial variation of LST increases the surface wind convergence, correspondingly enhances local vertical motions in the atmospheric boundary layer, and creates favorable conditions for the LES formation on the lee sides of the Great Lakes. The contribution of LST spatial variations to the increase in precipitation on the lee sides of the lakes varies between 5% and 30% in individual LES events. The increase in the winter-mean snow water equivalent due to LST spatial variations is between 3% and 15%. The most significant impact of LST variation on the winter-mean snow water equivalent is on the lee side of Lake Huron.

In 2014, H. plecostomus, sediment, and water samples were collected during 15 sampling events. A combination of semi-selective enrichment and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) revealed the presence of salmonellae in 45% of the fish intestines across the entire year, with a prevalence range of 13-100% per sampling event. Repetitive element sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR) and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) revealed a high diversity of salmonellae from fish intestine samples at individual sampling times, single or multiple presence of rep-PCR patterns and serotypes within individual fish, and identical rep-PCR patterns and serotypes for different fish within and across sampling events. Overall, 15 serotypes were identified by MLST, with a diversity range between one and seven serotypes per sampling event. Some serotypes were retrieved only once, while others were detected more frequently. A few serotypes were retrieved at several sampling times, nearly evenly distributed over the entire sampling period. Prevalence and diversity were independent of precipitation events, indicating the potential presence of environmental strains that are capable of long-term persistence in the environment.																			1477-8920					JUN	2018	16	3					460	471		10.2166/wh.2018.235	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wh.2018.235								29952334					WOS:000437020600013

Here we present a well-dated 'peat deposit-lake sediment' alternate sequence at Tengchong, southwestern China, and discuss the peatland development and its linkage to the global glacial methane cycle. Peat layers were formed during the cold Marine Isotope Stage (MIS)-2 and -4, whereas lake sediments coincided with the relatively warm MIS-3, which is possibly related to the orbital/suborbital variations in both temperature and Asian summer monsoon intensity. The Tengchong peatland formation pattern is broadly synchronous with those over subtropical southern China and other tropical/subtropical areas, but it is clearly in contrast to those over the mid-high Northern Hemisphere. The results of this work suggest that the shifts of peatland development between the tropical/subtropical zone and mid-high Northern Hemisphere may have played important roles in the glacial/interglacial global atmospheric CH4 cycles.

Investigation of the Thermal and Energy Balance Regimes of Great Slave and Great Bear Lakes	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY												Great Slave Lake and Great Bear Lake have large surface areas, water volumes, and high latitudinal positions; are cold and deep; and are subject to short daylight periods in winter and long ones in summer. They are dissimilar hydrologically. Great Slave Lake is part of the Mackenzie Basin flowthrough system. Great Bear Lake is hydrologically isolated in its own relatively small drainage basin and all of its inflow and outflow derive from its immediate watershed. Great Slave Lake's outflow into the Mackenzie River is more than 8 times that from Great Bear Lake. Input from the south via the Slave River provides 82% of this outflow volume. These hydrological differences exert pronounced effects on the thermodynamics, hydrodynamics, and surface climates of each lake. The quantitative results in this study are based on limited datasets from different years that are normalized to allow comparison between the two lakes. They indicate that both lakes have regional annual air temperatures within 2 C of one another, but Great Slave Lake exhibits a much longer open-water period with higher temperatures than Great Bear Lake. During the period when the lakes are warming, each lake exerts a substantial overlake atmospheric cooling, and in the period when the lakes are cooling, each exerts a strong overlake warming. This local cooling and warming cycle is greatest over Great Bear Lake. Temperature and humidity inversions are frequent early in the lake-warming season and very strong lapse gradients occur late in the lake-cooling season. Annually, for both lakes, early ice breakup is matched with late freeze-up. Conversely, late breakup is matched with early freeze-up. The magnitudes of midlake latent heat fluxes (evaporation) and sensible heat fluxes from Great Slave Lake are substantially larger than those from Great Bear Lake during their respective open-water periods. The hypothesis that because they are both large and deep, and are located in high latitudes, Great Slave Lake and Great Bear Lake will exhibit similar surface and near-surface climates that are typical of large lakes in the high latitudes proves invalid because their different hydrological systems impose very different thermodynamic regimes on the two lakes. Additionally, such an extensive north-flowing river system as the Mackenzie is subjected to latitudinally variable meteorological regimes that will differentially influence the hydrology and energy balance of these large lakes. Great Slave Lake is very responsive to climatic variability because of the relation between lake ice and absorbed solar radiation in the high sun season and we expect that Great Bear Lake will be affected in a similar fashion.

J	Peterson, JT; Scheerer, PD; Clements, S				Peterson, James T.; Scheerer, Paul D.; Clements, Shaun			An Evaluation of the Efficiency of Minnow Traps for Estimating the Abundance of Minnows in Desert Spring Systems	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Desert springs are sensitive aquatic ecosystems that pose unique challenges to natural resource managers and researchers. Among the most important of these is the need to accurately quantify population parameters for resident fish, particularly when the species are of special conservation concern. We evaluated the efficiency of baited minnow traps for estimating the abundance of two at-risk species, Foskett Speckled Dace Rhinichthys osculus ssp. and Borax Lake Chub Gila boraxobius, in desert spring systems in southeastern Oregon. We evaluated alternative sample designs using simulation and found that capture-recapture designs with four capture occasions would maximize the accuracy of estimates and minimize fish handling. We implemented the design and estimated capture and recapture probabilities using the Huggins closed-capture estimator. Trap capture probabilities averaged 23% and 26% for Foskett Speckled Dace and Borax Lake Chub, respectively, but differed substantially among sample locations, through time, and nonlinearly with fish body size. Recapture probabilities for Foskett Speckled Dace were, on average, 1.6 times greater than ( first) capture probabilities, suggesting "trap-happy" behavior. Comparison of population estimates from the Huggins model with the commonly used Lincoln-Petersen estimator indicated that the latter underestimated Foskett Speckled Dace and Borax Lake Chub population size by 48% and by 20%, respectively. These biases were due to variability in capture and recapture probabilities. Simulation of fish monitoring that included the range of capture and recapture probabilities observed indicated that variability in capture and recapture probabilities in time negatively affected the ability to detect annual decreases by up to 20% in fish population size. Failure to account for variability in capture and recapture probabilities can lead to poor quality data and study inferences. Therefore, we recommend that fishery researchers and managers employ sample designs and estimators that can account for this variability.																			0275-5947	1548-8675					2015	35	3					491	502		10.1080/02755947.2015.1017125	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02755947.2015.1017125													WOS:000357389100008
J	Banks, JR; Heinold, B; Schepanski, K				Banks, Jamie R.; Heinold, Bernd; Schepanski, Kerstin			Dust aerosol from the Aralkum Desert influences the radiation budget and atmospheric dynamics of Central Asia	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												The Aralkum is a new desert created by the desiccation of the Aral Sea and is an efficient source of dust aerosol which perturbs the regional Central Asian radiation balance. COSMO-MUSCAT model simulations are used to quantify the direct radiative effects (DREs) of Aralkum dust, and investigate the associated perturbations to the atmospheric environment. Considering scenarios of "Past" (end of 20th century) and "Present" (beginning of 21st century) defined by differences in surface water coverage, it is found that in the Present scenario the simulated yearly mean net surface DRE across the Aralkum is -1.34 Wm-2 with a standard deviation (+/-) of 6.19 Wm-2, of which -0.15 +/- 1.19 Wm-2 comes from dust emitted by the Aralkum. In the atmosphere the yearly mean DRE is -0.62 +/- 2.91 Wm-2, of which -0.05 +/- 0.51 Wm-2 is from Aralkum dust: on the yearly timescale, Aralkum dust is cooling both at the surface and in the atmosphere, due to its optically scattering properties. The daytime surface cooling effect (solar zenith angle less than or similar to 70-80 degrees) outweighs the nighttime heating effect and the atmospheric daytime (solar zenith angle less than or similar to 60-70 degrees) heating and nighttime cooling effects. Instantaneous Aralkum dust DREs contribute up to -116 Wm-2 of surface cooling and +54 Wm-2 of atmospheric heating. Aralkum dust perturbs the surface pressure in the vicinity of the Aralkum by up to +0.76 Pa on the monthly timescale, implying a strengthening of the Siberian High in winter and a weakening of the Central Asian heat low in summer. These results highlight the impacts of anthropogenic lakebed dust on regional atmospheric environments.

J	Hargeby, A; Blindow, I; Andersson, G				Hargeby, Anders; Blindow, Irmgard; Andersson, Gunnar			Long-term patterns of shifts between clear and turbid states in Lake Krankesjon and Lake Takern	ECOSYSTEMS												During the past century, Lake Takern and Lake Krankesjon, southern Sweden, have shifted repeatedly between a state of clear water and abundant submerged vegetation, and a state of turbid water and sparse vegetation. Long-term empirical data on such apparently alternative stable state dynamics are valuable as complements to modeling and experiments, although the causal mechanisms behind shifts are often difficult to identify in hindsight. Here, we summarize previous studies and discuss possible mechanisms behind the shifts. The most detailed information comes from monitoring of two recent shifts, one in each lake. In the 1980s, L. Krankesjon shifted to clear water following an expansion of sago pondweed, Potamogeton pectinatus. Water clarity increased when the pondweed was replaced by characeans. Zooplankton biomass in summer declined and the concentration of total phosphorus (TP) was reduced to half the previous level. The fish community changed over several years, including an increasing recruitment of piscivorous perch (Perca fluviatilis). An opposite directed shift to turbid water occurred in Lake Takern in 1995, when biomass of phytoplankton increased in spring, at the expense of submerged vegetation. Consistent with the findings in L. Krankesjon, phyto- and zooplankton biomass increased and the average concentration of TP doubled. After the shift to clear water in L. Krankesjon, TP concentration has increased during the latest decade, supporting the idea that accumulation of nutrients may lead to a long-term destabilization of the clear water state. In L. Takern, data on TP are inconclusive, but organic nitrogen concentrations oscillated during a 25-year period of clear water. These observations indicate that intrinsic processes cause gradual or periodic changes in system stability, although we cannot exclude the possibility that external forces are also involved. During such phases of destabilization of the clear water state, even small disturbances could possibly trigger a shift, which may explain why causes behind shifts are hard to identify even when they occur during periods of extensive monitoring.																			1432-9840	1435-0629				FEB	2007	10	1					29	36		10.1007/s10021-006-9008-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-006-9008-5													WOS:000246766000004
J	Tomkins, JD; Lamoureux, SF				Tomkins, JD; Lamoureux, SF			Multiple hydroclimatic controls over recent sedimentation in proglacial Mirror Lake, southern Selwyn Mountains, Northwest Territories	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												Varves from Mirror Lake, Northwest Territories (62 degrees N, 128 degrees W) reveal significant, but changing climatic influences on discharge and sedimentation on a decadal scale during the late 20th century. The complex hydroclimatic signal within the sediments indicates the difficulty in identifying a quantitative relationship between varve thickness and a single climatic variable. Regression of recent varve thickness with local meteorological data shows July temperature as the dominant control over sediment accumulation. In contrast, the dampening effects of increased snowfall on glacier ablation and resultant runoff reduce sediment delivery. Although the impact of snowfall does not appear to significantly weaken the relationship between summer temperature and varve formation, periods when multiple climatic factors control sediment delivery are characterized by distinctive varves containing two prominent silt units. Thus, the Mirror Lake hydrological system appears to shift between two general states. The first state involves a pronounced summer glacial meltwater phase due to dominant summer temperature influences on glacial melt, resulting in varves with one silt unit. This varve structure dominates the sedimentary record from A.D. 1670 to 1941, possibly reflecting a Little Ice Age influence in the study area. The second state operates in years when glacial meltwater discharge is delayed until August, due to increased snow cover, and the lake receives increased sediment-poor nival melt. These conditions lead to the formation of varves with two silt units corresponding to nival and glacial discharge phases and are common in the sedimentary record from A.D. 1390 to 1669 and A.D. 1942 to 1996.																			0008-4077	1480-3313				SEP	2005	42	9					1589	1599		10.1139/E05-049	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/E05-049													WOS:000234422600005

Field investigation and hydrogeochemical data were obtained from autumn 2010 to autumn 2013. The data were analyzed using the multivariate statistical methods principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), in conjunction with groundwater classification based on the main ionic composition. The stable isotope ratios of delta 18O and delta D were used to determine the origin of the groundwater and its connection to surface water bodies. The groundwater geochemistry is characterized by distinct redox zones caused by the influence of organic matter, pyrite oxidation, and preferential flow pathways due to different hydrogeological conditions. The groundwater is of the Ca-HCO3 type and locally of the Ca-HCO3-SO4 type, with low TDS, alkalinity, and pH, but elevated Fe and Mn concentrations, KMnO4 consumption, and, occasionally, Ni concentrations. The decomposition of organic matter adds CO2 to the groundwater, and in this study, the dissolution of CO2 was found to increase the pH and enhance the buffering capacity of the groundwater. The mobility of redox-sensitive elements and trace metals is controlled by pH and redox conditions, which are affected by the pumping rate, precipitation, and temperature. With the expected future increases in precipitation and temperature, the buffering capacity of the aquifer system will enhance the balance between alkalinity from bioactivity and acidity from recharge and pyrite oxidation.

Survival, Growth and Reproduction of Non-Native Nile Tilapia II: Fundamental Niche Projections and Invasion Potential in the Northern Gulf of Mexico	PLOS ONE												Understanding the fundamental niche of invasive species facilitates our ability to predict both dispersal patterns and invasion success and therefore provides the basis for better-informed conservation and management policies. Here we focus on Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus Linnaeus, 1758), one of the most widely cultured fish worldwide and a species that has escaped local aquaculture facilities to become established in a coastal-draining river in Mississippi (northern Gulf of Mexico). Using empirical physiological data, logistic regression models were developed to predict the probabilities of Nile tilapia survival, growth, and reproduction at different combinations of temperature (14 and 30 degrees C) and salinity (0-60, by increments of 10). These predictive models were combined with kriged seasonal salinity data derived from multiple long-term data sets to project the species' fundamental niche in Mississippi coastal waters during normal salinity years (averaged across all years) and salinity patterns in extremely wet and dry years (which might emerge more frequently under scenarios of climate change). The derived fundamental niche projections showed that during the summer, Nile tilapia is capable of surviving throughout Mississippi's coastal waters but growth and reproduction were limited to river mouths (or upriver). Overwinter survival was also limited to river mouths. The areas where Nile tilapia could survive, grow, and reproduce increased during extremely wet years (2-368%) and decreased during extremely dry years (86-92%) in the summer with a similar pattern holding for overwinter survival. These results indicate that Nile tilapia is capable of 1) using saline waters to gain access to other watersheds throughout the region and 2) establishing populations in nearshore, low-salinity waters, particularly in the western portion of coastal Mississippi.

Decadal changes in surface CO2 concentrations and CO2 fluxes in a mountain lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Climate warming impacts biogeochemical cycles in lakes. However, the factors controlling CO2 dynamics in mountain lakes over multidecadal scales are poorly understood. Here, we capitalized on long-term monthly data (1995-2022) of oligotrophic mountain Lake Tovel and calculated surface CO2 concentrations and flux by applying geochemical relationships and the thin boundary layer approach. Advanced time-series and regression modeling was used to determine temporal patterns and environmental parameters explaining surface CO2 concentrations and flux. Surface CO2 concentrations were highest from 2009 to 2017 (annual mean: 109.1 mu mol CO2 L-1) but lower before and after this period. Concomitantly, the air-water CO2 flux (mu mol CO2 m(-2) d(-1)) showed a period of lowest (mean(1995-2010): 6.4 +/- 0.7), highest (mean(2011-2017): 35.7 +/- 2.1), and intermediate emissions (mean(2018-2022): 19.3 +/- 4.7). Temporal modeling showed that hypolimnetic and deep hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen (DO) had the same change points and trends as surface CO2 concentrations. In multiple linear regression, hypolimnetic DO, silica, and the standardized precipitation index (pseudo-R-adj.(2) = 0.62; p < 0.01) best predicted annual mean surface CO2 concentrations. Regression results and the overlap between temporal trend patterns indicated that surface CO2 concentrations of Lake Tovel were positively influenced by external (loading of allochthonous carbon) and internal (lake autumn mixing) factors. The recent decline in surface CO2 concentrations from the year 2018 was attributed to increased stratification that offset lake autumn mixing and thus lead to the observed decline. These results help us to better understand the carbon cycle in mountain lakes in a changing climate.

HELENS	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												The concentrations of CH4 and CH4 oxidation rates were measured in lakes impacted by the May 18, 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. The highest CH4 concentrations were recorded during the first summer after the eruption and ranged in surface waters from 5 mu M in the moderately impacted Ryan Lake to 28 mu M in the heavily impacted North Coldwater Lake. At depths below the oxic/anoxic interface, CH4 levels reached 250 mu M in North Coldwater Lake, 184 mu M in Spirit Lake, 70 mu M in Castle Creek Lake, and 60 mu M in Ryan Lake. The CH4 flux measurements from these lakes during the summer following the May 18, 1980 eruption were the highest ever recorded in lakes with ranges of 1.1-2.9 mmol CH4 m(-2) d(-1) in the light to moderately impacted McBride and Ryan Lakes to ranges of 17.4-25.3 mmol CH4 m(-2) d(-1) in the heavily impacted Castle Creek, North Coldwater, and Spirit Lakes. Evidence of CH4 oxidation was seen in all of the lakes during the summer of 1981, and rates of CH4 oxidation using C-14-CH4 were measured in Spirit Lake from 1982 to 1986. The highest rates of CH4 oxidation measured were during the summer stratification and ranged from 50 to 150 nmol CH4 oxidised L-1 d(-1). Methane oxidation rates were measured in waters having oxygen concentrations less than 100 mu M with highest activity occurring at concentrations of 30-60 mu M. Spirit Lake samples taken during 1986 showed a marked reduction in the levels of CH4. This has corresponded with a marked reduction in the levels of dissolved organic material in the lake and an apparent decline in sedimentary methanogenesis. The lakes heavily impacted by the eruption of Mount St. Helens, while having gone through a 2-3 year period of eutrophy following the massive input of organic wood debris and inorganic nutrients associated with ash and pyroclastic materials, are presently rapidly returning to preemption conditions characteristic of oligotrophic, subalpine lakes.																			0886-6236	1944-9224				DEC	1988	2	4					357	370		10.1029/GB002i004p00357	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/GB002i004p00357													WOS:000211475100005

Morphological Variation of Cisco across Gradients of Lake Productivity	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The effects of lake productivity and late-summer hypolimnetic oxygen on the size and shape of Cisco Coregonus artedi were examined in 27 Minnesota lakes. Geometric morphometry analyses of specimens captured in vertical gill nets indicated that Cisco in more productive lakes with hypoxic hypolimnia were larger, with deeper bodies, shorter snouts and caudal peduncles, and longer fins. Cisco in unproductive lakes with oxygenated hypolimnia were smaller, with slender bodies, longer snouts and caudal peduncles, and shorter fins. The effect of hypolimnetic oxygen on depths utilized by Cisco and the resulting vulnerability to predation was an important driver of shape and fin length. Deeper body depths and longer fin lengths were possibly a response to greater vulnerability to predation when hypoxic hypolimnia limit coldwater refugia for Cisco, which are forced to inhabit shallower depths near warmwater predators such as Walleye Sander vitreus and Northern Pike Esox lucius. Differences in size and shape relationships of Cisco in lakes on and off the Canadian Shield were also detected. The availability of late-summer habitat, depth-mediated predation risk, and growth potential appear to be important ecological drivers of morphological variation in Cisco.					; Grow, Ryan/AAR-4441-2021	Grow, Ryan/0000-0002-9716-8779; 													0002-8487	1548-8659				JUL	2020	149	4					462	473		10.1002/tafs.10242	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tafs.10242		MAY 2020											WOS:000534819300001
J	Chantha, SC; Cloutier, L; Cattaneo, A				Chantha, SC; Cloutier, L; Cattaneo, A			Epiphytic algae and invertebrates on aquatic mosses in a Quebec stream	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												We sampled algae and invertebrates growing on aquatic mosses in a Quebec trout stream to a) assess their temporal and spatial variations in biomass, taxonomy, and size, and b) to compare the communities on mosses to those on nearby rocks. The biomass of epiphytic algae and invertebrates was remarkably stable during the summer despite a strong mid-summer flood. The invertebrate community was dominated by chironomids (especially Orthocladiinae), Ephemeroptera and Coleoptera. The relative importance of these taxa changed over the season as the size distribution of the entire community. Part (43 %) of the spatial variation in algal biomass was explained by moss biomass. However, epiphyton biomass did not increase proportionally with moss biomass: dense vegetation had less epiphyton per unit of plants than sparse stands. With increasing moss biomass, invertebrates tended to become more abundant, but smaller, resulting in an almost constant biomass across the moss biomass gradient. Algal biomass and invertebrate density were much larger (5-fold and 10-fold, respectively) on mosses than on nearby rocks whereas invertebrate biomass was similar on the two substrata, because of a striking difference in size distribution between the two communities. Algal and invertebrate communities living on aquatic mosses are temporally stable and related to the density of moss patches. Epiphytic invertebrate communities differ in density, size, taxonomy, but not necessarily in biomass, from communities on other substrata. The extent of moss cover can, therefore, alter stream metabolism and trophic interactions.																			0003-9136					JAN	2000	147	2					143	160																WOS:000085557300002

Derek			Dispersal Patterns of Coastal Largemouth Bass in Response to Tournament Displacement	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Tournament displacement, stockpiling near release points, and handling stress are major concerns for managers of sport fisheries in the southeastern USA. We examined the effects of transport distance and tournament handling stress on dispersal of 40 Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides via telemetry from May 2012 to September 2013 in the Albemarle Sound system of eastern North Carolina. Largemouth Bass were captured from four tributaries of Albemarle Sound and transported 16.5-45 km to a central release point before being acoustically tagged and released. Movement data from an array of passive receivers was used to calculate rates of dispersal from the release point, emigration from the study area and return to capture location over time. Blood cortisol concentration, collected from our tagged Largemouth Bass and those captured in an actual tournament, was used to determine the effect of stress on potential postrelease movement and survival. Our findings indicate little evidence of long-term stockpiling (i.e., fish remaining close to release point; Richardson-Heft et al. 2000); 57% of displaced Largemouth Bass dispersed more than 500 m from the release point within 7 d and 87% within 21 d postrelease. Half of those that emigrated from Edenton Bay returned to their capture location. However, no Largemouth Bass displaced 35-45 km returned to their capture locations, suggesting that long-distance displacement inhibits return. Fishing (2.8%) and nonharvest mortality (0.5%) were low throughout this study except for peaks observed during late spring (42.9%) and early summer (25.1%) of 2013. Mean cortisol concentrations were similar in Largemouth Bass collected during our simulated tournament (126.7 ng/mL) and an actual tournament (118.4 ng/mL). However, cortisol concentrations were unrelated to survival, postrelease dispersal, or return of tagged individuals to their capture location. Largemouth Bass appear to be able to cope with current tournament practices; however, restrictions on displacement distance may increase return rates.

J	SCHOOLEY, JB				SCHOOLEY, JB			INCOMPATIBILITY MECHANISM OF BIENNIS GROUP I RACES OF OENOTHERA	GENETICS												Twenty-three races of Oenotheras of the biennis group 1 were crossed with 3 races known to transmit the alpha complex through the pollen. The races used as pollen parents were Hot Springs, Birch Tree 1, and Camp Peary E. Alpha alphas were obtained in 21 of the crosses with Hot Springs, 17 of the crosses with Birch Tree 1, and 14 of the crosses with Camp Peary E. The alpha.alphas of each series were intercrossed in all combinations to determine compatibility relationships. The pollen tube behavior of the alpha complexes of the 6 races Baltimore, Birch Tree 2, Bestwater 2, Camp Peary E, Paducah, and Warrenton is governed by a gametophytic oppositional system with no gene interaction and no identity of S alleles among them. The alpha complexes of the races Magnolia, Friendship and Whartonae have the same factor, S7. The S9 allele is common to both alpha Chicaginensis and alpha Walkerton. Alpha Poplar Bluff and alpha Lake have identical S alleles, S10. The occurrence of identical S alleles in the alpha complexes of several races is considered to be without phylogenetic significance. It is postulated that gene interaction occurs prior to meiosis in a number of combinations in the Birch Tree 1 and Camp Peary E series, and in one combination in the Hot Springs series, which then later prevents the pollen from growing in any combination even when the gametophytic oppositional mechanism is not involved.																			0016-6731	1943-2631					1965	52	1					145	+											17248266					WOS:A19656603300013
J	Stauch, G				Stauch, Georg			Geomorphological and palaeoclimate dynamics recorded by the formation of aeolian archives on the Tibetan Plateau	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												Aeolian sediments are an important archive for palaeoclimate reconstructions on the Tibetan Plateau. The accumulation of aeolian sediments and the formation of palaeosols are used as a proxy for dry and wet phases, respectively. During the last decade the number of OSL (optically stimulated luminescence) ages of aeolian sediments has been rapidly increasing. This study summarises the results from more than 300 individual OSL ages. Despite the widespread occurrence of aeolian sediments on the Tibetan Plateau nearly all OSL samples are located on the northeastern and the southern part. In most regions the strongest accumulation occurred during the late Glacial and in the early Holocene. This coincides with the strengthening of the Asian summer monsoon on the Tibetan Plateau and wetter climate conditions after the relatively dry glacial times. The development of a sufficient vegetation cover, acting as a sediment trap, seems to be an important requirement for the preservation of aeolian archives. Short dry periods like the Younger Dryas led to a more enhanced aeolian accumulation Without destruction of previously formed archives in some regions. The formation of palaeosols occurred mainly during the wet early and mid-Holocene, but the number of ages is relatively small. In contrast, a second phase of aeolian accumulation during the late Holocene was related to the weakening of the Asian summer monsoon and drier climate conditions. This indicates that the reaction of aeolian accumulation on the Tibetan Plateau depends on the previous climate state. A comparison between the OSL ages from aeolian sands and loess deposits yields a different timing of deposition of these two sediment types. While the sand deposits in different basins resemble wet and dry phases, loess deposits show no common signal between the analysed areas. This indicates an influence of local factors, such as varying source areas and erosive processes on the slopes. In general, the aeolian archives in the high mountain environment are governed by numerous factors besides the climatic influence. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We performed a detailed study of the hydrogeochemistry, geochemical evolution, and enrichment of Nie' er Co waters using the chemical compositions and stable isotopes (delta D and delta O-18) of hot springs, stream water, ice, seep water, and lake water. Ion concentrations and the total dissolved solids (TDS) were in the order: lake water >= stream water > seep water > ice. We classified waters into three types: T1 (hot springs), T2 (seep water, stream water, and ice), and T3 (lake water). Hydrogeochemistry evolved from Na-HCO3 in headwaters to Ca-Mg-SO4/Cl in the lake, passing through an intermediate Ca-Mg-HCO3 transitional stage in-between. The main processes controlling water chemistry were found to be carbonate dissolution and continuous evapoconcentration. This was confirmed using the Hardie and Eugster model, which demonstrated that the evolution of lake water during evaporation should reach a final composition of Na-Mg-SO4-Cl. Using the delta D and delta O-18 of snow, stream water, ice, and seep water, we determined the Nie' er Co meteoric water line (NMWL) to be delta D = 8.18 delta O-18 + 30.27 (gamma = 0.97). Stream water, ice, and seep water originate from the melting of mountain snow or ice. Lake water undergoes strong evaporation, and hot springs originate from local meteoric water and belong to a low-medium temperature hydrothermal system. Three main steps control the formation of the Nie' er Co borate deposits: (a) meteoric waters filter through deep, B-rich volcanic strata; (b) water flows upwards into hot springs, carrying B and other minerals into the lake recharge waters; and (c) lake water is concentrated owing to the arid and cold climate, allowing kurnakovite and other borate minerals to precipitate. The integrated hydrogeochemical approach developed in this study furthers our understanding of Qinghai-Xizang (Tibet) plateau borate deposits.					lv, yuanyuan/JJC-4057-2023; Nie, Zhen/AAJ-5994-2021; ye, chuanyong/MGT-3699-2025														0016-7002	1880-5973					2016	50	4					327	339		10.2343/geochemj.2.0421	http://dx.doi.org/10.2343/geochemj.2.0421													WOS:000383258100004
J	Schröder, L; Schmieder, P; Hupfer, M				Schroeder, Lucas; Schmieder, Peter; Hupfer, Michael			Biogenic polyphosphate as relevant regulator of seasonal phosphate storage in surface sediments of stratified eutrophic lakes	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Polyphosphate is formed by polyphosphate-accumulating organisms occurring in various terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems as well as industrial environments. Although polyphosphate-accumulating organisms and polyphosphate have been well studied in enhanced biological phosphorus (P) removal from wastewater treatment plants, their role in the internal P cycle of natural lakes remains unclear. Several studies have shown that polyphosphate storage is widespread in lake sediments. In this study, 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to analyse the seasonal dynamics of polyphosphate and its drivers at the sediment surface of three stratified German lakes with strong seasonality of hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations. Similar seasonal patterns of polyphosphate were observed in all three lakes. Polyphosphate content increased by a factor of three to five at the beginning of summer stratification, with the maximum content observed in May when oxygen was already very low. During this period, strong redox gradients prevailed within the topmost sediment layer, and highly soluble reactive P concentrations were present in the pore water due to the reductive release of P bound to iron(III)oxides and oxide-hydroxides. Polyphosphate acted as a temporary P storage and was released after a delay, which may mitigate sedimentary P release into the water body during the (early) summer stratification. The observed seasonal dynamics of polyphosphate at the sediment surface offer a novel insight into the link between the P and iron cycles in lakes.																			0168-2563	1573-515X				APR 4	2025	168	2							40	10.1007/s10533-025-01230-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-025-01230-x													WOS:001459828000001

The phytoplankton community was sampled biweekly at three different water depths (surface, middle and bottom) in the reservoir from November 2002 to February 2004. A range of 18 environmental variables including temperature, electrical conductivity (EC), total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) were measured to assess their influence on phytoplankton community succession. As well, combined multivariate analyses with a cluster analysis and a nonmetric multidimensional scale (NMDS) were conducted. Microcystis aeruginosa was the dominant species in all seasons except spring. Thus, Cyanophyceae was a dominant taxonomic group. In spring, Bacillariophyceae dominated, followed by Cryptophyceae and Chlorophyceae. The succession was relatively delayed at the middle and bottom layers compared with at the surface layer. Abundance and species richness of phytoplankton were also higher in the surface layer than in the bottom layer. Cluster analysis classified the phytoplankton community into four clusters at each depth, and the changes were also well reflected in the NMDS ordination. Each cluster showed seasonal patterns characterized by indicator species, as well as environmental variables such as temperature, conductivity, and nutrients including N and P. Seasonal dynamics of the phytoplankton community was the strongest at the surface layer and weakest at the bottom layer. These depth-variable environmental variables are likely to be the key factors driving changes in the phytoplankton community composition.					; Kim, Baik-Ho/D-9356-2011; Park, Youngseuk/D-6462-2013; Shin, Kyung-Hoon/AAD-6999-2021; Hwang, Sunjin/AAK-7149-2020	Park, Young-Seuk/0000-0001-7025-8945; Shin, Kyung-Hoon/0000-0002-3169-4274; An, Kwang-Guk/0000-0003-2018-580X; Hwang, Soon-Jin/0000-0001-7083-5036; 													0003-4088	2100-000X					2009	45	2					93	105		10.1051/limn/2009014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/2009014													WOS:000268325200004

Hyperaridity persists at least since the Miocene and was punctuated by pluvial phases. However, very little is known about the timing, regional spread and intensities of precipitation changes. Here, we present a new precipitation record from a sedimentary sequence recovered in a tectonically blocked endorheic basin that is located in the hyperarid core of the Atacama Desert. The chronostratigraphic framework of the record is given by a multi-disciplinary dating approach, suggesting an age of ca. 68 ka BP for the core base. The sequence consists of three sediment types, whose sedimentological and geochemical characteristics suggest different depositional processes that reflect different degrees in humidity. First, particularly fine-grained sediments with high clastic but low calcium sulfate and carbonate contents reflect a particularly dry climate with only sporadic precipitation events and fluvial supply via channel systems. Second, more coarse-grained sediments with lower clastic and higher calcium sulfate and carbonate contents reflect more moist conditions with stronger precipitation events that lead to fluvial activity not restricted to the channels but involving the slopes and plains in the catchment. Third, normally graded layers with an equally high proportion of calcium sulfate and carbonate reflect occasional high-precipitation events that caused sediment supply also from most distant parts of the catchment via severe flash floods. The sedimentary succession suggests that precipitation changes took place on orbital but also on millennial time scales. Rather moist periods occurred during most of MIS 2, several shorter periods within MIS 3 and parts of MIS 4. Comparison of the findings from the Huara record with selected climate records from continental and marine sites in South America suggests a strong precipitation heterogeneity across the Atacama. This heterogeneity is caused by pronounced differences in the dominating climate patterns and a shift from predominant summer rain in the north to winter rain in the south. Precipitation supply to the Huara clay plan is controlled by the atmospheric circulation rather than the surface temperature of the adjacent ocean.					; Campos, Eduardo/JSK-2788-2023; Dunai, Tibor/E-9558-2012; Bolten, Andreas/O-4604-2015; Ritter, Benedikt/P-5798-2015; Wennrich, Volker/I-3435-2012; Brill, Dominik/O-2442-2015; Bao, Roberto/D-4092-2009; Melles, Martin/J-4070-2012	Campos, Eduardo/0000-0003-2048-7445; Melles, Martin/0000-0003-0977-9463; Ritter, Benedikt/0000-0002-5652-1169; Bolten, Andreas/0000-0003-1287-9705; Rolf, Christian/0000-0002-1459-6664; Dunai, Tibor Janos/0000-0001-8858-2401; Wennrich, Volker/0000-0003-3617-1963; Brill, Dominik/0000-0001-8637-4641; Scheidt, Stephanie/0000-0002-9370-2700													0921-8181	1872-6364				JAN	2020	184								103054	10.1016/j.gloplacha.2019.103054	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2019.103054													WOS:000508491500028

October 1995 eruptions	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH												Eruptions from Ruapehu volcano on 11 and 14 October 1995 covered large portions of the central and eastern North Island, New Zealand, with tephra, including c. 17 000 km(2) of land in primary production. The thickness and distribution of the tephra was mapped and it was chemically characterised in order to predict its effects on soil fertility. Tephra from the two eruptions contained 3.0 and 0.7 % by weight sulphur (S), respectively, 67-55 % of which was in an elemental form (S-0), with the remainder in the form of soluble sulphate. The S-0 in the tephras was derived from the former, hydrothermal Crater Lake system in the active vent of Ruapehu. Sulphate was derived from Crater Lake water and gases erupted with the tephra. Field and glasshouse investigations showed that the tephra significantly raised soil sulphate levels. The initial elemental S component was very fine grained (65-99 % < 125 mu m diameter) and oxidised rapidly causing depression of soil pH. In a transect of northern Rangitikei soil and pasture samples, S concentrations increased with increasing tephra thickness and remained above normal levels for at least 8 months after tephra fall. Pasture Se concentrations also rose briefly but returned to more normal levels for these soils after 5 months. Other nutrient elements were deposited in useful amounts only under heavy tephra falls. Toxic elements were minor components of the tephra sampled. As Crater Lake reforms following eruption episodes, future tephra eruptions from Ruapehu can be expected to have similar agronomic effects.

J	Decrouy, L; Vennemann, TW; Ariztegui, D				Decrouy, Laurent; Vennemann, Torsten Walter; Ariztegui, Daniel			Sediment penetration depths of epi- and infaunal ostracods from Lake Geneva (Switzerland)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Many (palaeo-)environmental parameters can be deduced from ecological and chemical analyses of ostracods. However, the specific ecology of each taxon has a great impact on its reaction to changing environmental conditions. As a consequence, each taxon records these changes differently. The mean penetration depth (MPD) and relative individual abundances have been documented along sediment depth profiles for the dominant sub-littoral to profundal species of ostracods in western Lake Geneva, Switzerland, and this data can be used to estimate their preferential habitat in terms of sediment depths. Isocypris beauchampi, Limnocytherina sanctipatricii, Cypria ophtalmica forma lacustris at 13-m water depths, Limnocythere inopinata, and a winter generation of Herpetocypris reptans have the shallowest habitat preferences at the study sites (MPDs of 0.45, 0.48, 0.49, 0.60, and 0.81 cm, respectively). These results suggest that these populations may be regarded as being preferentially epifaunal forms. Populations of Cytherissa lacustris (MPDs of 0.61, 0.73, and 0.82 cm at 13-, 33-, and 70-m water depths, respectively), Cypria ophtalmica forma lacustris at 70 m (MPD = 0.96 cm), Fabaeformiscandona caudata (MPD = 0.99 cm), and a summer generation of Herpetocypris reptans (MPD = 1.03 cm) were identified as being infaunal. Candona neglecta is the species that was found the deepest in the sediment of Lake Geneva, with MPDs of 0.65, 1.22, and 1.30 cm at 13-, 33-, and 70-m water depths, respectively. Information on the sediment texture and oxygen concentrations inferred from the analyses of sediment pore water suggest that the oxygen content of the sediment pore water is not the only dominant parameter controlling the differences in ostracod sediment penetration depths observed among the different sites, but that they might also be influenced by the sediment 'softness,' which itself depends on grain size, water content, and the abundance of organic matter in sediment.					; Ariztegui, Daniel/AFU-2302-2022	Ariztegui, Daniel/0000-0001-7775-5127; 													0018-8158					JUN	2012	688	1					5	23		10.1007/s10750-010-0561-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-010-0561-8													WOS:000303066600002

Cyprinodon elegans is native to spring-fed waters in the area, whereas C. variegatus was introduced into Lake Balmorhea in the 1960s. The two species contact one another near the mouth of a canal connecting spring flows with the lake. Within the canal, genotypes expected of C. elegans, C. variegatus, F1 hybrids, and backcross progeny represented 7%, 85%, 5%, and 3%, respectively, of the pupfish collected. In lake areas outside the canal, all individuals were classified morphologically as C. variegatus, and genotypes typical of C. elegans were absent. There was only meager evidence of introgression in the lake population of C. variegatus outside the area of contact between the two species.																			0045-8511					AUG 17	1994		3					590	597																WOS:A1994PD12700002

Here, a novel and efficient analytic method (retracking approach) is presented for the estimation of LIT from Ku-band (13.6 GHz) radar altimetry data. The new retracker, referred to as LRM_LIT, is based on the physical modeling of the conventional radar echoes (also called low-resolution mode or LRM) over ice-covered lakes that show a characteristic step-like feature in their leading edge attributed to the reflection of radar waves at the snow-ice and ice-water interfaces. The method is applied to Jason-2 and Jason-3 data acquired over Great Slave Lake, Canada, over three ice seasons (2013-2016). As expected, the agreement between the Jason-2 and Jason-3 LIT estimates over their overlapping period (2016 ice season) is excellent with a mean bias error of 0.013 m and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.024 m. LIT estimates from LRM_LIT are in good agreement with simulations from a thermodynamic lake ice model and in situ measurements with RMSE values of the order of a few centimeters for the three winter seasons. The retracker also provides a robust way to assess the accuracy of LIT estimates which is in the order of 0.10 m when the ice cover is well established and prior to melt onset. In addition, LRM_LIT captures the seasonal transitions during the freeze-up and breakup periods and ice growth over different winter seasons, making it a promising method for monitoring inter-annual variability and trends in LIT from past and current conventional radar altimetry missions.					; Duguay, Claude/G-5682-2011	Duguay, Claude/0000-0002-1044-5850; Mangilli, Anna/0000-0002-4457-3690; 													0196-2892	1558-0644					2022	60								4305515	10.1109/TGRS.2022.3186253	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2022.3186253													WOS:000838672300020

EXPOSED TO SIMULATED OVERLAND AND BOATING-VECTOR TRANSPORT CONDITIONS	JOURNAL OF SHELLFISH RESEARCH												Juveniles and adults hitch-hiking in fishing gear, recreational vessels, and fisheries and aquaculture products are believed to be important vectors of local dispersal of invasive European green crab (Carcinus maenus L.). Assessing the distance green crab might spread by hitch hiking requires an estimate of survival time under typical transport conditions. An exposure experiment (stocking density 62 crabs/m(2)) was conducted in fish crates containing: just crabs (no water, no cover), dry rope, damp eelgrass (Zostera marina L.), seawater (1.5 cm deep), rope + seawater, or celgrass + seawater. At mean air temperature of 24 degrees C, almost no crabs died during the first 48 h, 50% of crabs stocked alone or with dry rope survived 68 It (none survived five days), 50% of crabs in eelgrass or eelgrass + seawater survived 90-100 h and > 80% of crabs in sea water or rope + seawater survived the full five days. The second experiment (just Crabs, sea water, and rope + seawater) used three stocking levels (84, 168, and 251 crabs/m(2)) and ran for seven days. Stocking density did not have a significant effect on survival. At mean air temperature of 29 degrees C, 50% of crabs fully exposed to air survived 60 h (almost none Survived seven days), whereas about 60% of crabs survived to seven days when seawater or seawater + rope were present. The Survival of green crab for several days out of water under severe summer conditions would allow them to be carried on boats to my point in Atlantic Canada, or almost anywhere on the eastern seaboard oil trailered boats. This could result in further northward dispersal and the introduction of "northern" genetic material into previously colonized southern portions of the range, potentially increasing over wintering survival.																			0730-8000	1943-6319				APR	2009	28	2					377	382		10.2983/035.028.0221	http://dx.doi.org/10.2983/035.028.0221													WOS:000265460900022

The objective of this Study was to clarify the rea distribution processes behind the accumulation of Cs-137 in the wetland. A mass balance budget of Cs-137 was calculated based oil soil and sediment samples and reports in the literature. Results showed that accumulation Occurred over several years. Of all the Cs-137 activity discharged between 1986 and 2002 from the upstream lake, 29% was estimated to be retained in the wetland. In 2003, measurements showed that 17 kBq m(-2) sedimented on the stream banks of the wetland. Continuing overbank sedimentation by spring flooding prolongs the time that the wetland will contain high activity concentrations Of Cs-137. Con sequently, organisms living in wetlands serving as sinks for Cs-137 may become exposed over long time periods to high activity concentrations. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the variability of water quality and the complexity of influencing variables pose large uncertainties for pond management practices and watershed planning. This study integrated a self-organizing map (SOM) and partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to evaluate the nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) variations in 39 typical farm ponds in the Dongting Lake basin, and related the variations to pond internal factors, external environment, and agronomic management. The results indicated that 39 monitored farm ponds faced a high risk of eutrophication owing to high N and P levels, and that total N (TN), total P (TP), and particulate P (PP) generally exceeded the threshold of level V surface water quality standards in China (2.0 mg N L-1 and 0.2 mg P L-1). Simultaneously, pond water quality showed high spatiotemporal variability, and pollution hotspots occurred mostly during the overlapping periods of fallow-dry-winter and planting-rainy-spring. Based on the constructed SEM model, external environmental factors (meteorology, catchment landscape composition, configuration, topography, and soil chemical properties), pond internal characteristics, and agronomic management combined explained 60.2 +/- 2.9 % and 54.2 +/- 3.1 % of the N and P variations, respectively. There were intricate interactions among the above latent variables, including such meteorology positively moderated the paths of soil chemical properties -> pond P and landscape composition -> pond N and P; landscape composition, soil, and pond internal characteristics mediated the effects of other variables on variations of N and P. The total effects (indirect effects + direct effects) of landscape composition on the variations of pond N and P were higher than those of other variables. Among all the indicators composing latent variables, agricultural and residential land area percentage, rainfall, water depth, and fish farming were relatively important in pond water quality variations. The constructed model and analytical results offer essential information for the accurate management and restoration of pond water quality.

Ice-cover is the principal driver of ecological change in High Arctic lakes and ponds	PLOS ONE												Recent climate change has been especially pronounced in the High Arctic, however, the responses of aquatic biota, such as diatoms, can be modified by site-specific environmental characteristics. To assess if climate-mediated ice cover changes affect the diatom response to climate, we used paleolimnological techniques to examine shifts in diatom assemblages from ten High Arctic lakes and ponds from Ellesmere Island and nearby Pim Island (Nunavut, Canada). The sites were divided a priori into four groups ("warm", "cool", "cold", and "oasis") based on local elevation and microclimatic differences that result in differing lengths of the ice-free season, as well as about three decades of personal observations. We characterized the species changes as a shift from Condition 1 (i.e. a generally low diversity, predominantly epipelic and epilithic diatom assemblage) to Condition 2 (i.e. a typically more diverse and ecologically complex assemblage with an increasing proportion of epiphytic species). This shift from Condition 1 to Condition 2 was a consistent pattern recorded across the sites that experienced a change in ice cover with warming. The "warm" sites are amongst the first to lose their ice covers in summer and recorded the earliest and highest magnitude changes. The "cool" sites also exhibited a shift from Condition 1 to Condition 2, but, as predicted, the timing of the response lagged the "warm" sites. Meanwhile some of the "cold" sites, which until recently still retained an ice raft in summer, only exhibited this shift in the upper-most sediments. The warmer "oasis" ponds likely supported aquatic vegetation throughout their records. Consequently, the diatoms of the "oasis" sites were characterized as high-diversity, Condition 2 assemblages throughout the record. Our results support the hypothesis that the length of the ice-free season is the principal driver of diatom assemblage responses to climate in the High Arctic, largely driven by the establishment of new aquatic habitats, resulting in increased diversity and the emergence of novel growth forms and epiphytic species.

Recruitment of burbot (Lota lota L.) in Lake Erie: an empirical modelling approach	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												World-wide, many burbot Lota lota (L.) populations have been extirpated or are otherwise in need of conservation measures. By contrast, burbot made a dramatic recovery in Lake Erie during 1993-2001 but declined during 2002-2007, due in part to a sharp decrease in recruitment. We used Akaike's Information Criterion to evaluate 129 linear regression models that included all combinations of one to seven ecological indices as predictors of burbot recruitment. Two models were substantially supported by the data: (i) the number of days in which water temperatures were within optimal ranges for burbot spawning and development combined with biomass of yearling and older (YAO) yellow perch Perca flavescens (Mitchill); and (ii) biomass of YAO yellow perch. Warmer winter water temperatures and increases in yellow perch biomass were associated with decreases in burbot recruitment. Continued warm winter water temperatures could result in declines in burbot recruitment, particularly in the southern part of the species' range.

Integrated geologic and geophysical modeling across the Bartlett Springs fault zone, northern California (USA): Implications for fault creep and regional structure	GEOSPHERE												The rate and location at depth of fault creep are important, but difficult advantage of the magnetic properties of serpentinite, a rock type commonly associated with fault creep, to model its depth extent along the Bartlett Springs fault zone, an important part of the San Andreas fault system north magnetic and gravity anomalies using geologic constraints along 14 cross sections over a distance of 120 km along the fault zone. Our results predict that the fault zone has more serpentinite at depth than inferred by geologic relationships at the surface. Existing geodetic models are inconsistent and predict different patterns of creep along the fault. Our results favor models with more extensive creep at depth. The source of the serpentinite appears to be ophiolite thrust westward and beneath the Franciscan Complex, an interpretation supported by the presence of antigorite, a high- temperature serpentine mineral stable at depth, in fault gouge near Lake Pillsbury.																			1553-040X					FEB	2024	20	1					129	151		10.1130/GES02684.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/GES02684.1		NOV 2023											WOS:001115133600001
J	Cirés, S; Casero, MC; Quesada, A				Cires, Samuel; Cristina Casero, Mariai; Quesada, Antonio			Toxicity at the Edge of Life: A Review on Cyanobacterial Toxins from Extreme Environments	MARINE DRUGS												Cyanotoxins are secondary metabolites produced by cyanobacteria, of varied chemical nature and toxic effects. Although cyanobacteria thrive in all kinds of ecosystems on Earth even under very harsh conditions, current knowledge on cyanotoxin distribution is almost restricted to freshwaters from temperate latitudes. In this review, we bring to the forefront the presence of cyanotoxins in extreme environments. Cyanotoxins have been reported especially in polar deserts (both from the Arctic and Antarctica) and alkaline lakes, but also in hot deserts, hypersaline environments, and hot springs. Cyanotoxins detected in these ecosystems include neurotoxins-anatoxin-a, anatoxin-a (S), paralytic shellfish toxins, beta-methylaminopropionic acid, N-(2-aminoethyl) glycine and 2,4-diaminobutyric acid-and hepatotoxins -cylindrospermopsins, microcystins and nodularins-with microcystins being the most frequently reported. Toxin production there has been linked to at least eleven cyanobacterial genera yet only three of these (Arthrospira, Synechococcus and Oscillatoria) have been confirmed as producers in culture. Beyond a comprehensive analysis of cyanotoxin presence in each of the extreme environments, this review also identifies the main knowledge gaps to overcome (e.g., scarcity of isolates and -omics data, among others) toward an initial assessment of ecological and human health risks in these amazing ecosystems developing at the very edge of life.

Carbon- and oxygen-stable isotopic signatures of methanogenesis, temperature, and water column stratification in Holocene siderite varves	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Manganoan siderite ([Fe,Mn]CO3) occurs in abundance of up to 19% (dry weight) as the sole endogenic carbonate within a succession of Holocene, organic-rich, varved sediments from freshwater Otter Lake (OL), Michigan. Radiocarbon dating and varve counts from a 7-m piston core constrain periods of major siderite accumulation to sediments older than 1200 cal yr BP. Sediment petrography suggests that siderite was a seasonal precipitate confined to the summer layer of the varve couplet. Bulk-sediment chemistry reveals cycles in abundance of manganese and aluminum coincident with centennial-scale cycles of siderite accumulation. Siderite delta C-13 and delta O-18 are enriched when the mineral is abundant and depleted when it is least abundant. Samples with high abundance of siderite precipitated in oxygen isotopic equilibrium with modern lake water, but are delta C-13 enriched relative to modern waters. Samples from intervals of low siderite abundance are delta C-13 and delta O-18 depleted relative to equilibrium with modern lake water. These data suggest that abundant siderite precipitation occurred when the OL water column was ferruginous (iron meromictic), allowing for enhanced ferrous iron concentrations and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) enriched in delta C-13 below the chemocline, where methanogenesis in waters and sediments influenced DIC composition. Seasonal siderite precipitation was triggered by water column alkalinity fluctuations driven by summer calcite dissolution. Manganese substitution in siderite lowered kinetic barriers to low-temperature mineral precipitation. Climate changes and basin filling influenced lake stratification and the rate of siderite precipitation. The siderite occurrence reported here displays remarkable similarity to its occurrence in Paleogene maar lake deposits, suggesting that further studies of Holocene lacustrine siderites may provide insight into ancient sedimentary systems and environments.

Phenology and Fraser River sockeye salmon marine survival	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Inspired by the pioneering work of Dr. Bill Peterson who demonstrated the utility of ocean indicators at predicting survival of coho and chinook salmon in the Columbia River, we investigated whether the phenology of primary productivity could explain variable marine survival of Fraser River sockeye salmon. Building on a study that had found a strong correlation between satellite-derived spring chlorophyll concentrations in Queen Charlotte Sound (British Columbia) and smolt survival, we hypothesized that smolt migration phenology could help to explain interannual survival differences among years. Applying a new migration model to 18 years of smolt migration data from Chilko Lake demonstrated that interannual differences in smolt migration timing were organized in up to 3 pulses of abundance with a general trend by the largest peak toward earlier peak migration dates over the time series (1998-2016). Analysis of satellite-derived fluorescence line height data within Queen Charlotte Sound identified 4 productivity domains through which most young sockeye salmon would migrate. Each domain had distinct seasonal productivity patterns. With these data, we were unable to demonstrate significant correlations between spring bloom dates in these domains and smolt marine survival, or between smolt migration timing and marine survival. Having separate survival estimates for each pulse and phenological indicators of the sockeye salmon prey base might improve our ability to test the hypothesis that phenology matters to sockeye salmon in the Queen Charlotte Sound region.																			0079-6611	1873-4472				SEP-OCT	2021	197								102632	10.1016/j.pocean.2021.102632	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2021.102632		AUG 2021											WOS:000702781100004

Combined sewer overflow (CSO) effluents are the primary source of fecal contamination of the river. An analysis of river flowrates was conducted using historical data and predicted flows from a future climate scenario. A spatio-temporal analysis of water quality trends with regard to fecal contamination was performed and the effects of changing flowrates on the dilution of fecal contaminants were analyzed. Along the river, there was a significant spatial trend for increasing fecal pollution downstream of CSO outfalls. Escherichia colt concentrations (upper 95th percentile) increased linearly from 2002 to 2012 at one drinking water treatment plant intake. Two critical periods in the current climate were identified for the drinking water intakes considering both potential contaminant loads and flowrates: local spring snowmelt that precedes river peak flow and extra-tropical storm events that occur during low flows. Regionally, climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the impacts of hydrological conditions on water quality in the studied basin. Based on climate projections, it is expected that spring snowmelt will occur earlier and extreme spring flowrates will increase and low flows will generally decrease. High and low flows are major factors related to the potential degradation of water quality of the river. However, the observed degradation of water quality over the past 10 years suggests that urban development and population growth may have played a greater role than climate. However, climate change impacts will likely be observed over a longer period. Source water protection plans should consider climate change impacts on the dilution of contaminants in addition to local land uses changes in order to maintain or improve water quality.

J	Solim, SU; Wanganeo, A				Solim, Sabah Ul; Wanganeo, Ashwani			Phosphorus and nitrogen budgets:: Implication of calcite precipitation and N:P ratio in regulating chlorophyll a values	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Two strong mechanisms, calcite precipitation and chronic low N:P ratio level, are determined to operate in Dal Lake (a shallow Himalayan lake) during the growth period from April to August, and jeopardize the influence of TP and TN loading of 5.89 g/m(2) yr(-1) and 35.73 g/m(2) yr(-1), respectively, by restricting the average column chlorophyll a values to 14.1 mg m(-3). Biogenic calcite precipitation was brought about during photosynthesis by dense macrophytic populations (average fresh biomass of 3.28 kg/m(2)) and was aided by increasing temperatures, pH, Saturation index (SI) and flushing rate. During the spring-summer period, from April to August, the average export NP ratio of 9:1 was reduced to 2.1:1 in the ambient system. The nitrogen dependence of algal biomass development was determined for the first time for this lake system by observing a better linear plot between TN loading yr(-1) vs. chlorophyll a values (r(2) = 0.37, r = 0.61, p = 0.06) instead of TP loading yr(-1) vs. chlorophyll a values (r(2) = 0.16, r = 0.40, p>0.05). This was further confirmed through two in situ experiments, where chlorophyll a was observed to increase progressively with increasing nitrogen share in NP ratio. Significant linear correlated plots were observed between enrichment medium having NP ratio of 4:1 to 16:1 at an interval of 4 vs. chlorophyll a (r = 0.95, r(2) = 0.91 at p<0.05) and enrichment medium having NP ratio of 4:1 to 18:1 at an interval of 2 vs. chlorophyll a (r = 0.73, r(2) = 0.53 at p<0.5).																			1040-2381					MAR	2007	23	1					1	10																WOS:000245783000001

The Current Trophic State and Water Quality of Lake Onego	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												The trophic state and water quality of Lake Oneg & ocy; have been assessed under climate warming and changes in anthropogenic load over the past 30 years. The water body retains its natural oligotrophic state during the summer stratification according to the concentration of Chl a. A small amount of readily mineralizable organic matter in water determines the low level of development of saprophytic bacteria, corresponding to xenosaprobic and beta-oligosaprobic waters. Only Kondopogskaya Bay in Lake Onego is characterized by a higher trophic level (mesotrophic) and water saprobity (beta-mesosaprobic) due to pollution by wastewater from the PPM and waste from trout farms. The local bloom of cyanobacteria in the open area of the lake was observed during the anomalous heating of the epilimnion in the summer of 2022 for the first time in the 50-year history of research. The increase in the concentration of humic substances in the water of the bays as a result of climate warming at this stage did not lead to a change in the level of saprophytic bacteria.

Alternative models fit to the data contrasted linear versus logistic algal growth, type I versus type II functional response, and prey-dependent versus ratio-dependent predation. In both lakes, the model with lowest prediction error had logistic algal growth and a type I, prey-dependent functional response. Under these models, the spring bloom and clear-water phase of productive lakes can be explained as an incomplete predator-prey cycle: the spring pulse of edible algae is followed by a peak of zooplankton; then, edible algae are overgrazed leading to the clear-water phase and collapse of the grazer biomass. This study demonstrates the use of time series data at the ecosystem scale to identify process-based models, contrast alternative models on a probabilistic basis, and estimate parameters. This approach avoids the assumptions involved in extrapolating ecosystem models from smaller scale studies.					; Carpenter, Stephen/AAQ-6404-2020	Munoz del Rio, Alejandro/0000-0002-1743-269X; 													0706-652X	1205-7533				AUG	1993	50	8					1757	1767		10.1139/f93-197	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f93-197													WOS:A1993MP10900019

Production estimates of 183 and 187 g C .cntdot. m-2 were obtained for 1979 and 1980; the estimate for 1981 was 50% higher. These values were 2- to 4-fold higher than estimates made in 1963 and 1964. Production in the metalimnion accounted for 29.44 and 34% of the total during the 3 summers. Changes in the vertical distribution of biomass in the water column appeared to have had a greater effect upon metalimnetic production than differences in water transparency or incident solar radiation. The average values measured for the latter 2 variables were reasonably similar during the 3 yr, whereas the depth at which the metalimnetic layer of cyanobacteria stratified decreased from 9 m in 1979 to 5 m in 1981.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1983	40	6					792	798		10.1139/f83-102	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f83-102													WOS:A1983QS61300013
J	Vilenica, M				Vilenica, Marina			Ecological traits of dragonfly (Odonata) assemblages along an oligotrophic Dinaric karst hydrosystem	ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Ecological traits of dragonfly larvae in tufa-depositing habitats of the Dinaric karst were studied monthly over a one-year period (2007-2008). The study encompassed various lotic karst habitats (springs, mountainous rivers, streams, tufa barriers) and microhabitats (angiosperms, mosses, cobbles, sand, silt with leaf litter). The aims of the study were to identify dragonfly composition, abundance and spatial distribution, their habitat and microhabitat preferences, and to determine the most important environmental factors explaining dragonfly assemblages in the studied hydrosystem. The dragonfly fauna was composed of eight species, Onychogomphus forcipatus (Linnaeus, 1758) was the most widespread and the most numerous. Water temperature, ammonium and oxygen concentrations had the highest influence on dragonfly assemblages. The most favorable habitat type were tufa barriers, less favorable were lower lotic habitats, while dragonflies were almost completely absent from upper lotic habitats and their springs. Dragonfly larvae preferred microhabitats with inorganic substrates (i. e. cobbles and sand) and slower water velocity, while they mostly avoided mosses associated with the strongest current. This study provides an important contribution to the knowledge of dragonfly ecology in lotic habitats of the Dinaric karst.					; Vilenica, Marina/L-2927-2019	Vilenica, Marina/0000-0003-2053-2461; 													0003-4088	2100-000X				OCT 2	2017	53						377	389		10.1051/limn/2017019	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/2017019													WOS:000412947900002

Decadal trends in water chemistry of Alpine lakes in calcareous catchments driven by climate change	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												High mountain lakes are considered sensitive indicators of the effects of natural and anthropogenic drivers, including atmospheric deposition and climate change. In this study, we assess long-term trends in the chemistry of a group of high altitude lakes in the Western Alps, Italy, lying in bedrock with a relevant presence of basic, soluble rocks. An in-depth investigation was performed on two key-sites (Lakes Boden Inferiore and Superiore) for which continuous chemical data are available for a period of 30 years. A group of 10 additional lakes in the same area was also considered; these lakes were sampled at the end of the ice-free period during irregular surveys in the period 1980-2017. Water samples were analysed for the main chemical variables, including pH, electrical conductivity, major ions (Ca2+, Na2+, K+, HCO3, Cl, SO42, NO3) and algal nutrients (phosphorus and nitrogen compounds, reactive silica). A steep increase in conductivity and ion concentrations was detected at the key-sites: conductivity increased from 40-45 to 60-70 mu S cm(-1) over the period 1984-2017; sulphate concentrations more than doubled over the same period (from 50-60 to 120-180 mu eq L-1) and base cations increased from 400-500 to 600-750 mu eq L-1. An increase in the solute content was also detected in the survey lakes (average conductivity from 39 +/- 20 to 57 +/- 23 mu S cm(-1)). The analysis of meteorological data revealed a significant increase of air temperature (0.019 degrees C y(-1) over the period 1950-2017), mainly in spring and summer (0.033 degrees C y(-1)), and a decrease of snow cover depth and duration. Meteo-climatic drivers were identified as the responsible for the chemical changes occurred in the lakes. Climate-driven effects on weathering rates were mainly indirect and occurred by affecting the flow paths of water at both surface and subsurface level. Cryosphere modification (reduced snow cover and permafrost thawing) also played a role. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This study concerns importance of the use of some analytical techniques for pollutants and parameters determination in Arctic environmental samples based on the example of total organic carbon, phenols, and formaldehyde determination and measurement of pH and electrical conductivity parameters. Significant average concentration levels of formaldehyde were observed in 2012 and reached 0.26 mg/dm(3). Furthermore, the highest determined levels of total organic carbon and electrical conductivity were observed in samples collected in summer 2013. The average value of total organic carbon in that year was 9.54 mg/dm(3), and electrical conductivity increased to 63.0 A mu S/cm. The results of surface water samples analyses show an increasing trend in pollutants concentration levels over the years what may suggest that each year the emission of contaminants from lower latitudes is bigger and, consequently, more of them are deposited in the Arctic.

Autogenic incision and terrace formation resulting from abrupt late-glacial base-level fall, lower Chippewa River, Wisconsin, USA	GEOMORPHOLOGY												A paucity of research exists regarding the millennial-scale response of inland alluvial streams to abrupt base-level fall. Studies of modern systems indicate that, over short time scales, the response is a diffusion-like process of upstream-propagating incision. In contrast, evidence from the lower Chippewa River (LCR), located in the upper Midwest of the USA, suggests that autogenic controls operating over time scales of several millennia can overwhelm diffusion, resulting in incision that is prolonged and episodic. During the Last Glacial Maximum, the LCR drained the Chippewa Lobe of the Laurentide Ice Sheet to the glacial upper Mississippi River (UMR). As a meltwater stream, it aggraded and filled its valley with glacial outwash, as did its largest tributaries, which were also meltwater streams. Its nonglacial tributaries aggraded, too, filling their valleys with locally derived sediment. During deglaciation, the UMR incised at least twice, abruptly lowering the LCR's base level - similar to 15 mat 16 ka or earlier and an additional 40 mat ca. 13.4 ka. Each of these base-level falls initiated incision of the LCR, led by upstream migrating knickpoints. The propagation of incision has, however, been a lengthy process. The optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages of terrace alluvium indicate that, by 13.5 ka, incision had advanced up the LCR only 15 km, and by 9 ka, only 55 km. The process has also been episodic, resulting in the formation of fill-cut terraces (inferred from GPR surveys and exposures of terrace alluvium) that are younger and more numerous in the upstream direction. Autogenic increases in sediment load and autogenic bed armoring, the result of periodic tributary-stream rejuvenation and preferential winnowing of fines by the incising river, may have periodically caused knickpoint migration and incision to slow and possibly stop, allowing lateral erosion and floodplain formation to dominate. A decline in sediment flux from stabilizing incised tributary stream systems would have led to renewed knickpoint migration and incision when floods of sufficient magnitude to breach the channel armor occurred. Minimal floodplain development along the upper section of the present-day LCR, along with the channel morphology of an unstable wandering gravel-bed river immediately downstream from it, suggest that the river is still responding to the base-level falls that happened many millennia ago. The autogenic controls on the LCR's response to UMR incision are a direct consequence of the thick fills of noncohesive sediment that accumulated in its valley and the valleys of its tributary streams during the Late Wisconsinan, making the LCR a prime example of a former proglacial river that remains a paraglacial fluvial system.

All of the lakes exhibit HREE-enriched shale-normalized patterns. The speciation of the REEs was determined and, in all cases, species greater than 99% of each of the REEs exist as Ln(CO3)2-complexes. The only exception to this is Summer Lake where minor amounts of phosphate species were also predicted. The large enrichments in the HREEs observed in these lakes are the result of the formation of stable carbonate complexes in solution where the HREEs preferentially form stronger carbonate complexes than the LREEs. Activity product calculations for REE phosphate coprecipitates in these lakes indicate the lakes are close to saturation with respect to these phases and suggest that these precipitates may limit the maximum dissolved REE concentrations in the lakes.					; Johannesson, K/G-9187-2012	Johannesson, Karen/0000-0001-8140-8160; 													0094-8276					MAY 1	1994	21	9					773	776		10.1029/94GL00005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/94GL00005													WOS:A1994NK05100008

Major element and rare earth element (REE) compositions of the Qionghai Lake sediments in Sichuan Province, southwestern China were analyzed, aiming to provide information on sediment source discrimination and history of chemical weathering intensities and its responses to variations of Indian summer monsoon (ISM) and paleoclimate conditions. As revealed by the A-CN-K diagram and other provenance proxies including TiO2/Zr ratio, Th/Sc vs. Zr/Sc and La/Th vs. Hf diagrams, as well as the REE characteristics, the source of Qionghai Lake sediments was felsic rocks. Additionally, these sediments were subjected to small changes in provenance, sedimentary sorting and recycling, and weak diagenesis after deposition and/or metasomatism, indicating original signals were maintained on the intensity of chemical weathering of source area. The chemical weathering intensities inferred from CIA (chemical index of alteration) values have significantly fluctuated over the past 28 kyr, reflecting three stages of paleoclimate evolution, which is consistent with grain size characteristics, carbonate contents, low-frequency magnetic susceptibilities, TOC and biomarker proxy (Paq). The CIA values changed significantly during the typical warm and cold climate events including the Last Glacial Maximum, Heinrich 1 cold event, Younger Dryas and Holocene Climatic Optimum, and generally exhibited an increasing trend in amplitude correspondingly, in concert with the climate shifting from cold and dry to warm and humid conditions. Generally warm and humid climate conditions suggest enhanced chemical weathering intensity, whereas weak chemical weathering denotes cold and dry climate in the ISM region. In addition, sequential variations of the CIA values during the past 28 kyr may reflect changing chemical weathering processes, in responses to the varying intensities of Indian summer monsoon and the climate conditions forced by the Northern Hemisphere solar insolation.					李, 建/HNJ-6710-2023; Wei, Zhifu/L-7126-2019; WANG, YONGLI/ABB-6990-2020														0031-0182	1872-616X				DEC 15	2020	560								109902	10.1016/j.palaeo.2020.109902	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2020.109902													WOS:000591245000001

Traps were deployed in the epilimnion and hypolimnion of the deepest basin during June, 1988, sampled twice during stratified conditions (August, September) and once after the lake had mixed (October). The downward flux of particulate material increased from summer to fall. The net sedimentation of organic matter ranged from 0.6 to 2.3 g m-2 d-1 at 4 m and increased to 2.1 to 3.2 g m-2 d-1 two meters above the bottom sediment indicating that resuspended sediment was at least 33% of the settling mass during all periods. The C:N ratios of captured particles (6.8-9.5) were between the ratios of plankton (5.8 to 6.8) and the sediments (9.9 to 10.2) but smaller than the ratios of terrestrial organic materials (13.5 to 222). The monosaccharide compositions of the entrapped particles were similar to plankton samples and different from the distinct composition of the sediments. Capture of rebound particles similar to the primary flux and not decomposition may have been responsible for this similarity. Total monosaccharide concentrations were lower in the sediments than in entrapped particles. Individual sugars exhibited different patterns of accumulation in the sediments. Glucose was lowest in sediments when the relative concentrations were compared to those in source materials and entrapped particles. In contrast, sediments had,the highest rhamnose and fucose concentrations. Bacterial biomass could only account for small portions of these sugars in the sediment. The distinct monosaccharide composition of resuspended sediments was not strongly recorded in materials captured by the sediment traps even after the lake had mixed.																			0018-8158					MAY 13	1994	284	1					79	91		10.1007/BF00005733	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00005733													WOS:A1994NR89500008

Experimental δ13C evidence for a contribution of methane to pelagic food webs in lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We tested the hypothesis that low stable carbon isotope (delta C-13) values commonly observed for zooplankton in humic lakes are due to their feeding on isotopically light methane-oxidizing microbes, and thus that methane-derived carbon is important in the food webs of these lakes. In replicate laboratory cultures, Daphnia longispina, a common crustacean zooplankter in humic lakes, were fed microbial suspensions with or without enrichment by biogenic methane. The delta C-13 values of Daphnia indicated consumption of C-13-depleted methanotrophic bacteria, while growth rates, survival, and reproduction of Daphnia in cultures enriched with methane were equal to or greater than those in nonenriched cultures. Results from lake enclosures during the autumn overturn period revealed a decrease in delta C-13 of adult Daphnia from -40.5 parts per thousand to -50.3 parts per thousand, reflecting extensive consumption of C-13-depleted methanotrophic bacteria. Methane-derived carbon is a more important contribution to carbon flux through lake pelagic food webs than has previously been suspected.

This study aimed to evaluate the occurrence of Eustrongylides in the paratenic host Perca fluviatilis (European perch) and in the definitive host, Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis (great cormorant), in Lake Annone, a shallow eutrophic lake located in the pre-mountainous area of the Alps in northwest Italy where wintering cormorants coexist with new breeding colonies. A total of 114 European perch and 48 cormorants were examined for the occurrence of Eustrongylides. All parasites collected were identified with microscopic examination and molecular analysis. Overall, 11 specimens of European perch (9.6%) and 13 individuals of cormorants (27%) harbored nematodes identified as fourth-stage larvae and adults of Eustrongylides excisus. The observed prevalence of Eustrongylides spp. appears to be intermediate between the higher values in cormorant breeding areas in northern Europe and the lower prevalence observed in their wintering sites in southernmost Europe. Considering the eutrophication status of freshwater ecosystems and the increasing population of the cormorants, Eustrongylides has an increasing potential range of dispersion in Europe, including Italy; thus an extensive surveillance should be carried out, especially given the zoonotic potential of this nematode.

A reconnaissance project led in the Northeastern United States (US) during the period of 2008-2010 identified a high prevalence of intersex smallmouth bass on or near US Fish & Wildlife Service National Wildlife Refuges that included the observation of 100% prevalence in smallmouth bass males collected from the Wallkill River, NJ, USA. To better assess the prevalence of intersex smallmouth bass across the state of New Jersey, a tiered reconnaissance approach was initiated during the fall of 2016. Surface water samples were collected from 101 (85 river, 16 lake/reservoir) sites across the state at base-flow conditions for estrogenicity bioassay screening. Detectable estrogenicity was observed at 90% of the sites and 64% were above the US Environmental Protection Agency trigger level of 1 ng/L. Median surface water estrogenicity was 1.8 ng/L and a maximum of 6.9 ng/L E2Eq(BLYES) was observed. Adult smallmouth bass were collected from nine sites, pre-spawn during the spring of 2017. Intersex was identified in fish at all sites, and the composite intersex prevalence was 93.8%. Prevalence across sites ranged from 70.6% to 100%. In addition to intersex, there was detectable plasma vitellogenin in males at all sites. Total estrogenicity in surface water was determined at these fish collection sites, and notable change over time was observed. Correlation analysis indicated significant positive correlations between land use (altered land; urban + agriculture) and surface water estrogenicity. There were no clear associations between land use and organismal metrics of estrogenic endocrine disruption (intersex or vitellogenin). This work establishes a baseline prevalence of intersex in male smallmouth bass in the state of New Jersey at a limited number of locations and identifies a number of waterbodies with estrogenic activity above an effects-based threshold.					; Iwanowicz, Luke/AAB-3247-2021; Smalling, Kelly/AGD-7567-2022	Millemann, Daniel/0000-0002-0039-2185; Iwanowicz, Luke/0000-0002-1197-6178; Boetsma, Anna/0000-0002-4142-8199; Smalling, Kelly/0000-0002-1214-4920; Procopio, Nicholas A./0000-0002-7368-1316; 														1660-4601				MAR 2	2020	17	6							2024	10.3390/ijerph17062024	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17062024								32204384					WOS:000529342300214

In this study we used stable C isotopes to understand how the C cycle of Lake Kinneret, Israel, responded to documented changes in phytoplankton species composition. We compared the annual delta C-13 cycle of particulate organic matter from surface water (POMsurf) between (1) years in which a massive spring bloom of the dinoflagellate Peridinium gatunense occurred (Peridinium years) and (2) years in which it did not (non-Peridinium years). In non-Peridinium years, the spring delta C-13-POMsurf maxima were lower by 3.3 parts per thousand. These spring delta C-13 maxima were even lower in POM sinking into sediment traps and in zooplankton (lower by 6.8 and 6.9 parts per thousand, respectively). These differences in the isotopic composition of the major organic C components in the lake represent ecosystem-level responses to the presence or absence of the key blooming species P. gatunense. When present, the intensive, almost monospecific bloom lowers the concentrations of CO2(aq), causing a reduction in the isotopic fractionation of the algae (higher delta C-13 of POMsurf) and massive precipitation of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). In non-Peridinium years, the phytoplankton cannot deplete CO2(aq) to similar levels; the algae maintain higher isotopic fractionation, leading to lower delta C-13 maxima. These changes are reflected higher up in the food web (zooplankton) and in sedimenting organic matter. The consequences for the ecosystem in non-Peridinium years are lower export of both organic and inorganic C.					Hambright, Karl/D-4086-2012	Hambright, K.

The methodology of study involved performing geochemical modeling, contamination source detection, and optimizing a new model using machine learning model for prediction of integrated weight water quality index (IWQI), Health risk indices (HI and HQ) regarding oral and dermal exposure to potentially toxic elements (PTEs). New hydrological insights for the region: The key findings of this research showed that the Nubian sandstone aquifer (NSSA) is characterized mainly by mixed Ca-Mg-Cl/SO4 fresh water type and influenced by silicate weathering. The nitrates sources fell between atmospheric inputs in the case of NSSA, soil nitrogen in Tertiary carbonate aquifer (TCA), springs, and drains, while sewage water strongly affects the lakes. The IWQI values demonstrated that water resources in the deep aquifer (NSSA) is appropriate for drinking with ranking of quality range from medium to excellent quality (IWQI < 150). The shallow aquifer (TCA) is suitable for drinking in the south east of the Oasis only with intermediate quality ranking (100 < IWQI < 150), while the poor water quality needs further treatment in the western side of Siwa Oasis. The non-carcinogenic risks evaluation revealed the vulnerability of child and adult to oral exposure of PTEs in the west and center of the investigated area. The feed forward back propagation neural network (FFBP-NN) model was a powerful tool for predicting IWQI and HI, where the relationship between the actual and predicted value had R-2 greater than 0.95 and mean square error (MSE) range from 5.4E-05-0.66, root mean square error (RMSE) between 0.006 and 0.81, and relative square error (RSE) between 0.001 and 2.4 E-05.

We installed Global Positioning System telemetry collars on 47 moose in the north of the Laurenticles Wildlife Reserve, Quebec, for 2-36 months. We recorded only 84 highway crossings in spring (0.29% of 28,967 2-hr steps) and 122 crossings in summer (0.18% of 68,337 2-hr steps), despite a high sampling effort and having captured moose close to highways. Moose movement rates during movement steps crossing a highway were on average 3 times higher than during the steps preceding or following highway crossing. Paths used by moose when crossing a highway were characterized by a high proportion of food stands, low proportion of lakes and rivers, and topography typical of a valley. Highway-crossing sites were located in valleys with brackish pools and forest stands providing coniferous cover but a low proportion of lakes and rivers. We adjusted moose crossing probability for local variation in moose density using aerial survey data and assessed crossing probability along the highways in the entire Laurentides Wildlife Reserve. We tested the model using moose-vehicle accident data from 1990 to 2002. The relationship between the density-adjusted crossing probability and number of accidents was relatively loose at the 1-km scale but improved markedly when using longer highway sections (5-15 km; r > 0.80). Our results demonstrate that roads and their surroundings are perceived as low-quality habitat by moose. We also conclude that road segments installed along secondary valleys could be a highly strategic site to deploy mitigation measures such as fences and that it could be desirable to increase the width of road shoulders to reduce forest cover and to eliminate brackish pools to reduce cervid-vehicle collisions. We suggest using empirical data such as location of vehicle wildlife collisions to plan mitigation measures at a fine scale.																			0022-541X					SEP	2007	71	7					2338	2345		10.2193/2006-499	http://dx.doi.org/10.2193/2006-499													WOS:000249351100030
J	WILCOX, DA; MEEKER, JE				WILCOX, DA; MEEKER, JE			IMPLICATIONS FOR FAUNAL HABITAT RELATED TO ALTERED MACROPHYTE STRUCTURE IN REGULATED LAKES IN NORTHERN MINNESOTA	WETLANDS												Water-level regulation has altered the plant species composition and thus the structure of nearshore aquatic macrophyte communities in two regulated lakes in northern Minnesota as compared with a nearby unregulated lake. Results of previous faunal studies in the regulated lakes were used as a basis for assessing the effects of vegetation changes on faunal communities. The unregulated lake with mean annual water-level fluctuations of 1.6 m supported structurally diverse plant communities and varied faunal habitat at all depths studied. Mean annual fluctuations on one regulated lake were reduced to 1.1 m, and dense beds of four erect aquatic macrophytes dominated the 1.75-m depth that was never dewatered. We suggest that this lack of plant diversity and structural complexity resulted in diminished habitat for invertebrates, reduced availability of invertebrates as food for waterbirds and fish, reduced winter food supplies for muskrats, and reduced feeding efficiency for adult northern pike, yellow perch, and muskellunge. Mean annual fluctuations in the other regulated lake were increased to 2.7 m, and rosette and mat-forming species dominated the 1.25-m depth that was affected by winter drawdowns. We suggest that the lack of larger canopy plants resulted in poor habitat for invertebrates, reduced availability of invertebrates as food for waterbirds and fish, and poor nursery and adult feeding habitat for many species of fish. In addition, the timing and extent of winter drawdowns reduced access to macrophytes as food for muskrats and as spawning habitat for northern pike and yellow perch. In regulated lakes throughout the world, indirect effects on aquatic fauna resulting from alteration of wetland and aquatic macrophyte communities should be considered when water-level management plans are developed.																			0277-5212					DEC	1992	12	3					192	203																WOS:A1992KF84300007

Surface Water Quality along the Central John Muir Trail in the Sierra Nevada Mountains: Coliforms and Algae	HIGH ALTITUDE MEDICINE & BIOLOGY												Ursem, Carling, Scott Evans, Kemal Ali Ger, John R. Richards, and Robert W. Derlet. Surface water quality along the central John Muir Trail in the Sierra Nevada Mountains: Coliforms and algae. High Alt. Med. & Biol. 10:349-355, 2009.-The John Muir Trail (JMT) in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California is one of the most popular alpine wilderness trails in the United States, where backpackers depend on trailside water sources for more than 335 km (208 miles). This study addressed the risk of acquiring waterborne disease by analyzing prevalence and changes in coliform bacteria and Escherichia coli (E. coli) in lakes and streams adjacent to the central JMT. Chlorophyll-a levels were also measured as an indicator of high elevation eutrophication. Categories of environmental land use which might affect water quality were defined as: Pristine areas rarely traversed by humans; Backpack off-trail areas not traversed by pack or stock animals; and Multiuse areas with backpacker and animal use. We analyzed surface water at 36 different sites three separate times over an eight week period in the summer of 2008. Chlorophyll-a concentration increased significantly in Backpack and Multiuse sites over the summer months, but not in Pristine sites. Similar results were obtained for coliforms, with prevalence also increasing significantly over the summer months in Backpack and Multiuse sites. There was a much higher prevalence of E. coli in Multiuse sites compared to Pristine and Backpack sites. Our study provides evidence pack and stock animals serve as a source of microbial contamination of water along this section of trail.

The nature of divergences between co-occurring sympatric species, factors contributing to reproductive isolation and modes of genome evolution is a much debated topic in evolutionary biology addressed by various experimental tools. To the best of our knowledge, nobody approached this field using molecular cytogenetics. We examined chromosomes and genomes of one postglacial species pair, sympatric European winter-spawning Coregonus albula and the local endemic dwarf-sized spring-spawning C. fontanae, both originating in Lake Stechlin. We have employed molecular cytogenetic tools to identify the genomic differences between the two species of the sympatric pair on the sub-chromosomal level of resolution. Results: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments consistently revealed a distinct variation in the copy number of loci of the major ribosomal DNA (the 45S unit) between C. albula and C. fontanae genomes. In C. fontanae, up to 40 chromosomes were identified to bear a part of the major ribosomal DNA, while in C. albula only 8-10 chromosomes possessed these genes. To determine mechanisms how such extensive genome alternation might have arisen, a PCR screening for retrotransposons from genomic DNA of both species was performed. The amplified retrotransposon Rex1 was used as a probe for FISH mapping onto chromosomes of both species. These experiments showed a clear co-localization of the ribosomal DNA and the retrotransposon Rex1 in a pericentromeric region of one or two acrocentric chromosomes in both species. Conclusion: We demonstrated genomic consequences of a rapid ecological speciation on the level undetectable by neither sequence nor karyotype analysis. We provide indirect evidence that ribosomal DNA probably utilized the spreading mechanism of retrotransposons subsequently affecting recombination rates in both genomes, thus, leading to a rapid genome divergence. We attribute these extensive genome re-arrangements associated with speciation event to stress-induced retrotransposons (re) activation. Such causal interplay between genome differentiation, retrotransposons (re) activation and environmental conditions may become a topic to be explored in a broader genomic context in future evolutionary studies.					; Rabova, Marie/G-7201-2014; Symonova, Radka/G-7188-2014; Staaks, Georg/AAR-7862-2021; Ráb, Petr/G-7176-2014; Bohlen, Joerg/LPP-8078-2024; Majtanova, Zuzana/G-7186-2014; Sember, Alexandr/W-4446-2017	Bohlen, Jorg/0000-0003-1259-008X; Symonova, Radka/0000-0002-2270-6018; Staaks, Georg/0000-0003-3516-6767; Majtanova, Zuzana/0000-0002-7100-2922; Sember, Alexandr/0000-0003-4441-9615													1471-2148					FEB 14	2013	13								42	10.1186/1471-2148-13-42	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2148-13-42								23410024					WOS:000315648800001

Maximum Cu concentrations (157.6 ppm) were found in oysters collected during fall, 1973; maximum Pb concentrations (22 ppm) were found in blue crabs collected from Nov., 1971-Feb., 1972. Pb concentrations were significantly lower in C. virginica collected during Nov., 1971-Feb., 1972, a period of excessive rainfall, relative to samples collected in the fall of 1973. This suggests that oysters are able to purge Pb during periods of Pb dilution.																			0040-4403						1976	27	4					419	426																WOS:A1976CW64100003

BIOGENIC ACTIVITY, TRACE FORMATION, AND TRACE TAPHONOMY IN THE MARGINAL SEDIMENTS OF SALINE, ALKALINE LAKE BOGORIA, KENYA RIFT VALLEY	SEDIMENT-ORGANISM INTERACTIONS: A MULTIFACTED ICHNOLOGY	Society for Sedimentary Geology Special Publication				1st International Congress on Ichnology	APR 19-23, 2004	Museo Paleontol Egidio Ferugl, Trelew, ARGENTINA		Museo Paleontol Egidio Ferugl			Actualistic studies of the distribution, formation, and taphonomy of vertebrate and invertebrate traces at saline (60-100 g 1(-1) TDS), alkaline (pH: 10.5) Lake Bogoria in the Kenya Rift Valley have revealed a diverse trace assemblage in the lake-margin sediments. Although hypersaline lakes like Lake Bogoria restrict lacustrine faunal diversity, local marginal subenvironments, including hot springs and ephemeral streams, provide favorable areas for the activities of many species of insects, mammals, birds, and reptiles. Several factors, including sediment texture and moisture content, substrate cohesion, substrate consolidation, and the presence of a food source (i.e., vegetation, microbes, animal waste, flamingo carcasses), control the distribution of traces at Lake Bogoria by influencing the behavior of vertebrates (e.g., "dirt bathing" and nest building) and invertebrates (mainly feeding and locomotion). The distribution of vertebrate traces is also controlled by the proximity to fresh water, but the relationship between invertebrate trace formation and pore-water salinity is less clear. Many characteristic features of closed-basin lakes, including frequent changes in lake level and shoreline position, the presence of thermal springs, and evolved fluid compositions resulting from evaporation, can have direct impacts on trace taphonomy. Notable taphonomic factors include efflorescent salt crystallization, which may temporarily cement substrates or destroy traces during crystal growth in the capillary fringe; substrate wetting and drying, which can induce soil crusting and the shrinking and swelling of smectitic clays, which in turn can modify trace morphology; and the presence of benthic microbial mats and biofilms, which can temporarily stabilize substrates or contribute to their early cementation by mediating carbonate precipitation. Semiarid environments, such as the Kenya Rift, are favorable settings for the early cementation of substrates by carbonates (e.g., calcite), and, during prolonged, stable dry phases, the preservation of trace fossils and their substrates by zeolites and other minerals (Mn- and Fe- oxyhydroxides).

A floodplain segment of the Danube River downstream of Vienna was studied during the hydrologically most dynamic phase (spring-summer) to evaluate the significance of connection between the main channel and the floodplain segment for particle abundance and quality as well as for bacterial and viral parameters, both free-living and attached to particles. 2. Hydrological connectivity between the main channel and its floodplain segment (expressed as water age) influenced particle abundance and quality. Polysaccharide-containing particles [Alcian positive-stained particles (ASP)] and protein-containing particles [Coomassie positive-stained particles (CSP)] each contributed a substantial fraction to total suspended solids and were both positively related to water age. ASP were about twice as abundant as CSP. 3. Water age influenced bacterial and viral abundance and the bacterioplankton productivity in the surrounding water. Free-living bacterial abundance and their bacterial secondary production (BSP) increased continuously with water age, best described by a linear regression. Water age also significantly impacted BSP and per cell BSP of bacteria attached to particles. The abundance of attached bacteria and viruses was not influenced by water age. 4. Bacteria and viruses on particles were influenced by particle quality. Their abundance on particles was closely related to particle size. Particle-attached bacteria accounted on average for 30.34% ( +/- 3.09) of the total bacterial abundance. A variable and occasionally significant proportion of viruses, between 0.43% and 35.06%, were associated with particulate material. 5. Bacteria attached to particles were significantly more productive than their free-living counterparts. Their per-cell activity was on average 8.6 times higher than that of the free-living fraction. 6. Hydrological connectivity between the Danube River and its floodplain is crucial not only for the exchange of water, sediment and nutrients, but also for microbiota, thus influencing microbial life, distribution and activity.

Identifying source regions for the atmospheric input of PCDD/Fs to the Baltic Sea	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												PCDD/F contamination of the Baltic Sea has resulted in the European Union imposing restrictions on the marketing of several fish species. Atmospheric deposition is the major source of PCDD/Fs to the Baltic Sea, and hence there is a need to identify the source regions of the PCDD/Fs in ambient air over the Baltic Sea. A novel monitoring strategy was employed to address this question. During the winter of 2006-2007 air samples were collected in Aspvreten (southern Sweden) and Pallas (northern Finland). Short sampling times (24 h) were employed and only samples with stable air mass back trajectories were selected for analysis of the 2,3,7,8-substituted PCDD/F congeners. The range in the PCDD/F concentrations from 40 samples collected at Aspvreten was a factor of almost 50 (range 0.6-29 fg TEQ/m(3)). When the samples were grouped according to air mass origin into seven compass sectors, the variability was much lower (typically less than a factor of 3). This indicates that air mass origin was the primary source of the variability. The contribution of each sector to the PCDD/F contamination over the Baltic Sea during the winter half year of 2006/2007 was calculated from the average PCDD/F concentration for each sector and the frequency with which the air over the Baltic Sea came from that sector. Air masses originating from the south-southwest, south-southeast and east segments contributed 65% of the PCDDs and 75% of the PCDFs. Strong correlations were obtained between the concentrations of most of the PCDD/F congeners and the concentration of soot. These correlations can be used to predict the PCDD/F concentrations during the winter half year from inexpensive soot measurements. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

What the Atacama Can Tell Us about Subsurface Mars	EARTH AND SPACE 2018: ENGINEERING FOR EXTREME ENVIRONMENTS					16th Biennial International Conference on Engineering, Science, Construction, and Operations in Challenging Environments (Earth & Space)	APR 09-12, 2018	Cleveland, OH	Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Aerosp Div				We used a Mars analog, the Chilean Atacama Desert, to simulate a drilling mission to Mars, as part of the Atacama rover astrobiology drilling study (ARADS) grant through NASA's PSTAR Program. Automated drilling from a rover platform within one meter of a conventional science dig allowed us to make a direct comparison of manned vs. unmanned data return at a potential two-million-year-old lake bed/evaporite site near Yungay Station. Science observations of soil type and biomolecule content compared well to planetary mission-type data of size distribution, cuttings angle of repose, drill telemetry, and instrument readings. Drill telemetry data taken during four companion studies allowed us to characterize soil horizons that might affect instrument results. Water signatures were encountered during a tracer study which demonstrated how much contamination is brought into a cohesive borehole by three different vectors: the drill itself, surface in-fall due to downstroke, and surface in-fall due to retraction. Water signatures were also encountered during a study of polygonal structures to interpret data variation in these large-scale soil formations also observed on Mars. Salt horizons were encountered during a biomarkers/halite transect study. Salt horizon data was also gained from a second polygon edge study in hyperarid soil, which linked lower drill torque at polygon edges with increased in-fall and mixing compared to that of polygon interiors. Characterizations of how a drill transforms and makes available subsurface information from this analog environment can help us interpret results of a drill-based mission to Mars. Results obtained in the Atacama indicate drill telemetry and cuttings offer a wealth of accurate subsurface data.																					978-0-7844-8189-9				2018							369	379																WOS:000462200100037

It is shown that most significant year-to-year differences in the analyzed characteristics are observed in the Middle Baikal region. In 2016, the surface temperature in this zone approaches 4 degrees C, and probably the vertical exchange process manifests itself here.

The multivariate statistical techniques were used in the hydrochemical evaluation of waters. Statistical analysis of water quality parameters was made to seeing the interrelationship between different variables in order to explain the water quality and pollution status of study area. For this purpose, water samples were taken from lake, river, stream, and springs which are represented by investigated area and water qualities were evaluated. Generally, Ca2+, Mg2+, and Cl-, HCO3- ions are dominant within surface water and water sources. Arsenic concentration increase is determined in Isikli spring and Kufi stream water samples. Also, aluminum concentration is high level in the Kufi stream water samples. This increase was related to igneous rocks as geogenic origin. Also, geogenic contamination was identified in R-mode factor and cluster analyses. There is high correlation between electrical conductivity and major ions of waters.																			1866-7511	1866-7538				MAR	2017	10	6							143	10.1007/s12517-017-2877-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12517-017-2877-4													WOS:000396895200018

The focus of this study was the response of the phytoplankton community to spatial and temporal shifts in salinity, nutrient concentration, watershed discharges, and water residence times, within the context of temporal patterns in rainfall. From a temporal perspective, both drought and flood conditions negatively impacted phytoplankton biomass potential. Prolonged drought periods were associated with reduced nutrient loads and phytoplankton inputs from the watershed and increased influence of water exchange with the Atlantic Ocean, all of which restrict biomass potential. Conversely, under flood conditions, nutrient loads were elevated, but high freshwater flushing rates in the estuary diminished water residence times and increase salinity variation, thereby restricting the buildup of phytoplankton biomass. An exception to the latter pattern was a large incursion of a cyanobacteria bloom from Lake Okeechobee via the St. Lucie Canal observed in the summer of 2005. From a spatial perspective, regional differences in water residence times, sources of watershed inputs, and the proximity to the Atlantic Ocean influenced the composition and biomass of the phytoplankton community. Long water residence times in the North Fork region of the St. Lucie Estuary provided an environment conducive to the development of blooms of autochthonous origin. Conversely, shorter residence times in the mid-estuary limit autochthonous increases in biomass, but allochthonous sources of biomass can result in bloom concentrations of phytoplankton.

Paleoecological evidence for abrupt cold reversals during peak Holocene warmth on Baffin Island, Arctic Canada	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												A continuous record of insect (Chironomidae) remains preserved in lake sediments is used to infer temperature changes at a small lake in Arctic Canada through the Holocene. Early Holocene summers at the study site were characterized by more thermophilous assemblages and warmer inferred temperatures than today, presumably in response to the positive anomaly in Northern Hemisphere summer insolation. Peak early Holocene warmth was interrupted by two cold reversals between 9.5 and 8 cal ka BP, during which multiple cold-stenothermous chironomid taxa appeared in the lake. The earlier reversal appears to correlate with widespread climate anomalies around 9.2 cal ka BP; the age of the younger reversal is equivocal but it may correlate with the 8.2 cal ka BP cold event documented elsewhere. Widespread, abrupt climate shifts in the early Holocene illustrate the susceptibility of the climate system to perturbations, even during periods of enhanced warmth in the Northern Hemisphere.

In addition, groundwater vulnerability is assessed taking into consideration groundwater flow and quality. The autochthonous Beydaglari limestone is the major karstic aquifer in the region. According to the groundwater level map of alluvium aquifers in the basins, groundwater discharge toward the carbonate aquifer is direct and indirect. The hydrogeological connection between ground and surface water basins occurs via the karstic aquifer located at the bottom of the alluvium bottom. In Egirdir lake, water also discharges in the karstic aquifer via karstic sinkholes at the western border of the lake. In the research area, general groundwater discharge is toward the Mediterranean Sea by means of autochthonous carbonate system, according to hydrogeological investigations, research of lineament and hydraulic conductivities. This result is supported by the locations of lineaments and shore springs discharging from the limestone. In addition, spreading of contaminants via karstic aquifer to great distance has been clearly identified.

Initial chemical and physical studies of this carbonaceous chondrite have shown it, to be unique. It, is one of the most primitive meteorites yet recovered and is physically weak. By determining the meteoroid trajectory, velocity, and physical breakup in the atmosphere, we can characterise the fireball as intermediate between Type II and Type IIIa, following the classification of Ceplecha et al. (1998). Modelling suggests an initial porosity for the pre-atmospheric meteoroid in the range 40-60%. The initial fragmentation occurred under less than 0.3 MPa dynamic pressure. Determination of Tagish Lake's orbit, suggests a linkage to parent, bodies in the main asteroid belt, though association with Ericke-type comets cannot be strictly excluded. Tagish Lake may represent an intermediate object, between chondritic asteroids and cometary bodies consistent, with a linkage to D-class asteroids based on results from reflectance-spectra work.					; Brown, Peter/C-8763-2018	Brown, Peter/0000-0001-6130-7039; 													0379-6566		92-9092-805-0				2001	495						497	505																WOS:000174658200080
J	Aeschbach-Hertig, W; Hofer, M; Schmid, M; Kipfer, R; Imboden, DM				Aeschbach-Hertig, W; Hofer, M; Schmid, M; Kipfer, R; Imboden, DM			The physical structure and dynamics of a deep, meromictic crater lake (Lac Pavin, France)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The characteristic feature of the physical structure of Lac Pavin is a distinct and permanent chemically induced density increase between about 60 and 70 m depth. This chemocline separates the seasonally mixed mixolimnion from the monimolimnion, which is characterized by elevated temperature and salinity as well as complete anoxia. Previously published box-models of the lake postulated substantial groundwater input at the lake bottom, and consequently a short water residence time in the monimolimnion and high fluxes of dissolved constituents across the chemocline. We present a new view of the physical structure and dynamics of Lac Pavin, which is based on the results of high-resolution CTD profiles, transient and geochemical tracers ( tritium, CFCs, helium), and numerical modeling. The CTD profiles indicate the existence of a sublacustrine spring above rather than below the chemocline. A stability analysis of the water column suggests that vertical turbulent mixing in the chemocline is very weak. A numerical one-dimensional lake model is used to reconstruct the evolution of transient tracer distributions over the past 50 years. Model parameters such as vertical diffusivity and size of sublacustrine springs are constrained by comparison with observed tracer data. Whereas the presence of a significant water input to the monimolimnion can clearly be excluded, the input to the mixolimnion - both at the surface and from the indicated sublacustrine spring - cannot be accurately determined. The vertical turbulent diffusivity in the chemocline is well constrained to K approximate to 5 x 10(-8) m(2) s(-1), about a factor of three below the molecular diffusivity for heat. Assuming thus purely molecular heat transport, the heat flow through the chemocline can be estimated to between 30 and 40 mW m(-2). With respect to dissolved constituents, the very weak turbulent diffusive exchange is equivalent to a stagnant monimolimnion with a residence time of nearly 100 years. Based on these results and vertical concentration profiles of dissolved species, diffusive fluxes between monimolimnion and mixolimnion can be calculated. A large excess of helium with a He-3/He-4 ratio of (9.09 +/- 0.01) x 10(-6) (6.57 R-a) is present in the monimolimnion, clearly indicating a flux of magmatic gases into the monimolimnion. We calculate a flux of 1.0 x 10(-12) mol m(-2) s(-1) for mantle helium and infer a flux of 1.2 x 10(-7) mol m(-2) s(-1) (72 t year(-1)) for magmatic CO2. The monimolimnion appears to be in steady state with respect to these fluxes.

Age and chemistry of dissolved organic carbon reveal enhanced leaching of ancient labile carbon at the permafrost thaw zone	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Climate change will alter the balance between frozen and thawed conditions in Arctic systems. Increased temperatures will make the extensive northern permafrost carbon stock vulnerable to decomposition and translocation. Production, cycling, and transport of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) are crucial processes for high-latitude ecosystem carbon loss that result in considerable export off the Arctic landscape. To identify where and under what conditions permafrost DOC is mobilized in an Arctic headwater catchment, we measured radiocarbon (C-14) of DOC and assessed DOC composition with ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) of surface waters and shallow and deep subsurface porewaters from 17 drainages in the Barrow Environmental Observatory in Alaska. Samples were collected in July and September 2013 to assess changes in age and chemistry of DOC over time. DOC age was highly variable ranging from modern (19 parts per thousand Delta C-14) to approximately 7000 BP (-583 parts per thousand Delta C-14). DOC age increased with depth, over the summer as the active layer deepened, and with increasing drainage size. DOC quality indicators reflected a DOC source rich in high molecular-weight and aromatic compounds, characteristics consistent with vegetation-derived organic matter that had undergone little microbial processing, throughout the summer and a weak relationship with DOC age. In deep porewaters, DOC age was also correlated with several biogeochemical indicators (including dissolved methane concentration, delta C-13, and the apparent fractionation factor), suggesting a coupling between carbon and redox biogeochemistry influencing methane production. In the drained thawed lake basins included in this study, DOC concentrations and contributions of vegetation-derived organic matter declined with increasing basin age. The weak relationship between DOC age and chemistry and consistency in DOC chemical indicators over the summer suggest a high lability of old DOC released by thawing permafrost.					; McFarlane, Karis/AAI-9276-2020; Repasch, Marisa/O-1818-2019; Heikoop, Jeffrey/C-1163-2011	McFarlane, Karis/0000-0001-6390-7863; Repasch, Marisa/0000-0003-2636-9896; Hedgpeth, Alexandra/0000-0002-4004-007X; Guilderson, Thomas/0000-0001-9371-7059; Heikoop, Jeffrey/0000-0001-7648-3385													1726-4170	1726-4189				FEB 28	2022	19	4					1211	1223		10.5194/bg-19-1211-2022	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-1211-2022													WOS:000765881600001

Pediastrum simplex var. duodenarium that belong to Chlorophyta, is the dominant taxon along the study. In autumn, a significiant increase have conditioned in the number of phytoplankton taxa and its density.

Yet despite this impressive effort, knowledge of migration patterns and strategies, including the location of stopover sites and migratory connectivity, remains incomplete because recapture and ring recovery rates are often extremely low. Using re-encounter records for ringed birds found dead or recaptured, and visual sightings reported for individuals ringed and fitted with nasal saddles, we investigated the patterns of postnuptial movements of Common Pochard Aythya ferina and Tufted Duck A. fuligula caught in France during the breeding season. So far, most ringing effort for these diving duck species has focussed on populations in northeast Europe, whilst migration patterns for the declining populations which breed in southwest European countries, including France, remain almost entirely unknown. Surprisingly, a large proportion of the individuals re-encountered at least once after capture were either resident birds or had initiated post-breeding movements to the north or east, to wintering sites spread over a large area encompassing northern France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Great Britain, as well as to the Alpine lakes (Lake Geneva and Lake Constance). The relatively large proportion of residents and short-distance migrants among the ringed individuals highlights the importance of harvest management schemes being assessed at the local scale, in the same manner as for more sedentary species.

J	Baehr, MM; DeGrandpre, MD				Baehr, MM; DeGrandpre, MD			Under-ice CO2 and O2 variability in a freshwater lake	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Autonomous, in situ sensors for the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) and dissolved oxygen (DO) were deployed in a freshwater lake during the winters of 1997 and 1998 to evaluate magnitude and sources of variability during ice-covered periods. Gas variability on diel or shorter time scales was small or undetectable during most of the deployment periods, only becoming significant prior to ice-out when runoff and light penetration increased, promoting convective currents and biological production. A surprising 7.6 d period oscillation, apparently driven by a baroclinic seiche, dominated the short-term variability during the first year. The gas trends associated with the seiche oscillations and periodic profile measurements revealed that ice formation led to gas gradients directly under the ice. Long-term variability was characterized by increasing CO2 and decreasing DO as a consequence of biological oxidation of organic matter. The results suggest that both spatial and temporal variability can be significant over intervals which would not be resolved by traditional sampling-based studies.

J	Hawley, N; Beletsky, D; Wang, J				Hawley, Nathan; Beletsky, Dmitry; Wang, Jia			Ice thickness measurements in Lake Erie during the winter of 2010-2011	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Time series measurements of ice thicknesses were made at either 1 or 2 Hz at 6 locations in the western part of lake Erie's central basin during the winter of 2010-2011. Ice was observed over approximately 80 days beginning in late December and continuing through mid-March. Deformation and ridging of ice occurred frequently and produced ice thicknesses of up to 10 m, and over 6 m at all stations. The measurements show considerable variability (up to several meters) between stations, even when the distance between them is <500 m. Comparison of the measurements to those generated by the National Ice Center show good agreement for undeformed thicknesses, but the Ice Center analyses do not account for increased thicknesses due to ice ridging. Several different measures of ice thickness (based on different averaging times and the parameter used to characterize the resulting distribution of thicknesses) are used to characterize the data, and the results can vary widely depending upon which measure is used. The best measure to use will depend upon the use for which the data is intended.

J	Ng, CA; Gray, KA				Ng, Carla A.; Gray, Kimberly A.			Forecasting the effects of global change scenarios on bioaccumulation patterns in great lakes species	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Climate change will have substantial impacts on biodiversity, particularly for aquatic species. Warming temperatures and changing weather patterns will also remobilize and modify chemical partitioning. Holding millions of cubic yards of sediments contaminated with persistent legacy chemicals such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dioxins, the Laurentian Great Lakes are a laboratory for observing interactions between biological and chemical responses to climate change. They provide a wide range of habitat to a variety of species, from littoral forage fish to deep-water predators. In this paper, we couple bioenergetic and bioaccumulation models to investigate the biological and chemical effects of climate change in the Great Lakes. We consider three species: round goby, a warm-water invasive forage fish; mottled sculpin, a cool-water native forage fish; and lake trout, a cold-water native predator. Using our coupled models, we calculate the accumulation of a representative persistent chemical, PCB-77, under four climate scenarios for Lake Erie and Lake Superior. Predator-prey (lake trout-round goby) interactions and food availability (high-low) are incorporated into our simulations. For cool- to cold-water species (sculpin, lake trout) we find that warm temperatures limit growth. For warm-water species (round goby) cold temperatures limit growth. The impact of climate warming on growth depends on the winter lows as well as the summer highs of the scenario, in combination with the species' critical upper and lower thermal limits. We find conditions for high growth and consumption rates generally lead to high bioaccumulation. However, this can be confounded by predator-prey dynamics, as mismatches in the temperature preferences of predator and prey can lead to mismatches in relative growth and uptake rates. As predator-prey dynamics are expected to undergo substantial shifts with changing climate, these relative thermal sensitivities will be key in determining the implications of climate change for bioaccumulation, particularly in top predator species.

The energy density of alewives varied more than twofold between peaks in September (age 1) or October-November (age greater-than-or-equal-to 2) and the lows in May (age 1) or July-September (age greater-than-or-equal-to 2). The previously described seasonal pattern of energy density of Lake Michigan alewives was similar except that energy density of older alewives (age greater-than-or-equal-to 3) was markedly higher in Lake Michigan. During 1978-1990, the spring energy density of Lake Ontario alewives peaked in 1979 (6,259 J/g wet weight), declined irregularly until 1985, and then remained stable through 1990 (at approximately 4,600 J/g). The initial decline may have been a density-dependent response to a burgeoning alewife population, but the lack of an increase in alewife condition in the late 1980s, when alewife biomass fell, suggests a decline in lake productivity. Energy density of rainbow smelt increased with age in Lake Ontario and condition was invariant during 1978-1990 despite a threefold change in rainbow smelt biomass. Rainbow smelt energy density was lower and fluctuated less seasonally in Lake Ontario than in Lake Michigan. Mean weight of alewives aged 2 and older dropped from 41 g in 1978 to 19 g in 1989 in Lake Ontario. Rainbow smelt aged 2 and older showed a drop in mean weight from 13-17 g in 1978-1982 to 8 g in 1990. This downward trend in mean size of alewives was correlated with the sizes of alewives consumed by Lake Ontario chinook salmon during 1983-1987. For adult chinook salmon to maintain a constant growth rate during 1978-1990, mean individual daily ration during June-October had to increase from a low of 2.2% body weight/d (or 1.5 prey fish/d) in 1979 to 3.1% body weight/d (3.7 prey fish/d) in 1988. This increase in forage demand may have caused the observed declines in individual condition of salmonines over this period.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				JUL	1994	123	4					519	534		10.1577/1548-8659(1994)123<0519:EDASOP>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1994)123<0519:EDASOP>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1994NZ67400007

Problems were encountered during high-water periods, as high water caused the trap to become submerged and useless once the windows were plugged with forest litter. However, these episodes were rare. The modified box trap design presented here proved effective in a variety of conditions and should provide fisheries scientists an effective tool for sampling juveniles in smaller streams.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				FEB	2006	26	1					170	174		10.1577/M05-008.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M05-008.1													WOS:000236430500020

Exposed shoreline tailings comprising 40.5 acres (16.4 ha) located on the southern perimeter of Pond 2 in the Warm Springs Operable Unit were to be wet closed, with Pond 2 discharge being required to meet Interim Water Quality Standards. Field studies were undertaken to evaluate the suitability of direct surficial lime additions to exposed tailings. Results indicated that lime slurry application rate of 8.96 Mg ha(-1)(4.0 ton/acre) would be optimal in reducing metal release into the overlying water column. Metal concentration in Pond 2 discharge during closure showed slightly higher dissolved Cu concentrations (0.055 - 0.105 mg/L) than predicted from column studies (0.050 mg/L). Limnological processes within Pond 2 related to the spring algal bloom and lake turnover was believed responsible for the observed differences.																					90-5809-025-6				1999							485	492																WOS:000078186900051

Bio-mediated cementation of supratidal beach sediments associated with groundwater springs	SEDIMENTOLOGY												The formation of beachrock, sensu stricto, via carbonate precipitation in the intertidal zone is widespread throughout the tropics and subtropics. While cementation of supratidal beach sediments has also been noted in several locations, it has received much less attention. Here, we report cementation of upper beach sediments promoted by discharge of mineralized groundwater springs and the associated development of microbial mats and biologically mediated tufa. These fundamentally supratidal deposits form at the co-occurrence of (a) unconsolidated clastic beach deposits, (b) carbonate-enriched groundwater and (c) bedrock or a stable substrate, where biological activity variably mediates precipitation of calcium carbonate cement. Analysis of sites in Ireland, Australia, South Africa and Scotland reveals commonalities and some differences that yield insights into the nature of cemented beach deposits and the cementation process. At some sites, primarily vadose, meteoric cementation occurs through the infiltration of beach sediments by groundwater, enabled by a stable substrate or bedrock and the infrequent mobility of back-beach deposits. At other sites, cementation by surficial biofilms or microbial mats forms microbial boundstone laminae, with mobile sediment producing multiple beds of cemented beach deposits and microbial boundstone in a multi-bed deposit. The differentiation of beachrock sensu stricto and the aforementioned groundwater spring-cemented beach deposits is key in establishing their utility as shoreline and associated sea-level indicators.

Following the technical requirements of the World Meteorological Organization on use of an evaporation pan for this purpose, we improved the use of the classical evaporation pan to measure at any time, with high precision, both evaporation and rainfall for a given locality. A microcontroller energizes a simple electromechanical level-measurement system to maintain the water level within a determined depth interval, and to measure the depth of water decreases (evaporation with 32m precision) or increases (rainfall with 4m precision). A prototype was succesful for 1 month (late summer) of field testing, but a longer testing period would be necessary to suggest its use in modern meteorological stations.					; Yürür, Tekin/HJB-2973-2022; ONACAK, TÜRKAY/G-6124-2013	Yurur, Tekin/0000-0002-3077-8249; Onacak, Turkay/0000-0002-2126-7914													1073-9149	1525-6030					2011	39	1					88	100	PII 932895791	10.1080/10739149.2010.537722	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10739149.2010.537722													WOS:000287189800007

WATER FERTILITY AND TOXICITY EVALUATED BY AN ALGAL GROWTH-POTENTIAL TEST	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												An investigation was undertaken to evaluate water fertility and toxicity of the River Nile in Egypt. Sixteen different sampling stations were selected for the purpose, three located upstream and thirteen downstream of Cairo. Water samples were seasonally collected during the period from autumn (1987) to summer (1988). Nutrient enrichment biotests to define algal growth limiting nutrients, their bioavailability and the heavy metal toxicity of the sampled water, were achieved using Selenastrum capricornutum Strain NIVA-CHL 1. Total dissolved phosphorus (TDP), dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP), total soluble inorganic nitrogen (TSIN = nitrate-N + nitrite-N + ammonium-N), total Kjeldahl-N (TKN = ammonia-N + organic-N), some trace metals (Cd, Cu, Fe, Pb and Zn) and phytoplankton chlorophyll a (observed Chl. a) were also analysed. The expected Chl, a was calculated by an empirical equation. It represents the maximum chlorophyll a biomass that the sampled water could support under optimum growth conditions. Nutrients, heavy metals, and observed Chl. a showed great regional and seasonal variations. The algal growth potential test (AGPT) exhibited results ranging from 0.02 mg l-1 to 84.8 mg l-1 algal dry weight. The algal growth was mainly limited by P, heavy metal toxicity and, in few cases, by N. Simultaneous addition of P, N, and EDTA supported the highest biomass production of the test alga. The bioavailability of both P and N was greatly affected by heavy metal toxicity. For most cases, the inhibition of algal growth due to metal toxicity was highly significant (p < 0.001). The observed Chl. a was significantly higher than the expected Chl. a, when P was the limiting nutrient and the reverse was true in case of N limitation. The expected Chl. a maintained a number of strong (r > 0.8 at p < 0.01) linear relationships with bioavailable phosphorus and nitrogen. However the magnitude of the predictive linear models was mainly dependent on the N:P mass ratio of the water samples. Also the N:P ratio displayed a great effect on nutrient limitations, as values below 10 involved N limitation, between 10 and 20 neither N or P can be supposed with certainty to be limiting (possible P and N co-limitation) and above 20, P was the most growth limiting nutrient. No consistent linear relationship was found between the observed and the expected Chl. a value. The algal growth potential test proved to be reliable method for assessing the fertility and toxicity of the River Nile waters.

Yet their spatial and temporal evolution is still debatable. Here, we present a stable isotopic record from the center of the Badain Jaran Desert, in Northwestern China, which records the variations and interplay of the two climate systems during the past 1200 ka. The results indicate that the westerlies dominated the Badain Jaran area at least from 1200 to 600 ka, and possibly earlier. Associated with ASM enhancement since 600 ka, the westerlies and ASM alternatively dominated the regional warm season precipitation during glacial-interglacial cycles, respectively. Meanwhile, the delta O-18(carb) of the Badain Jaran area showed high-frequency fluctuations which may reveal the joint impact of ASM and westerlies on regional hydrology after 450 ka. Affected by the westerlies and ASM changes, the C4 plants stepwise expanded at 600, 450, and 300 ka. These stepwise variations of westerlies and ASM are response to the global climate change which significantly influenced the ASM at 600 and 450 ka, and westerlies at 300 ka, respectively. In addition, the uplift of the Pamir-Tibetan Plateau during the middle Pleistocene also exerts a profound effect on westerlies and ASM pattern across the East Asia on a long-term time scale.

In connection with a large stability investigation covering both sides of the Gota River, from the lake Vanern to the city of Gothenburg, the usefulness of CPTu and static pressure sounding for mapping of quick clay was studied. Evaluation of the correlation between the slope of the penetration force and the presence of quick clay was done within two areas of this investigation. In addition, a separate study was carried out with the purpose to investigate whether surface resistivity measurements together with sounding, using a CPTu-R with measurement of the total penetration force, in combination with fall-cone tests and chemical analyses in the laboratory could give a more complete picture of the presence of quick clay.																					978-0-415-62136-6				2013							1001	1008																WOS:000328054700116

Anatomy of the recurrent coastal sediment plume in Lake Michigan and its impacts on light climate, nutrients, and plankton	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												As part of the Episodic Events Great Lakes Experiment, we sampled total suspended matter (TSM), light climate, nutrients, and plankton along cross-margin transects in southern Lake Michigan during February, March, and April 1998-2000 to capture conditions before, during, and after the occurrence of storm-driven recurrent coastal sediment plumes to define the anatomy of the resuspension events and get insights into their interactions with nutrients and plankton. Variability in timing and strength of winter storms among years led to different timing, intensity, and extent of plumes among years. TSM concentrations in the core of plumes varied between 15 and 30 mg L-1, and photic depth was reduced to similar to 1 to 2 m, thus potentially seriously limiting phytoplankton growth in plume areas. Total P concentration was highly correlated with TSM and river influence. Chlorophyll concentrations were lower in plume regions than in adjacent areas, in contrast to the relatively constant chlorophyll concentration across the plume predicted by a coupled hydrodynamic and nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton model. Contrary to expectation, protozoan microzooplankton (MZ) biomass was not more abundant in the plume than adjacent waters, but was highest in nearshore areas receiving river inflow. Storms affected horizontal distribution of zooplankton. Because of the lower concentrations of phytoplankton in the plume, the plume over the short term had a negative impact on zooplankton during this food-limiting season. Our results combined with those of other EEGLE studies lead us to conclude that storms and storm-driven plumes had a negative effect on the planktonic food web.					; Lavrentyev, Peter/Q-7449-2017	Chen, Changsheng/0000-0001-8715-6101; Liebig, James/0000-0002-0433-9066; Vanderploeg, Henry/0000-0003-1358-8475; Lavrentyev, Peter/0000-0001-5635-7920; Ruberg, Steven/0000-0001-8809-5689													2169-9275	2169-9291				MAR 6	2007	112	C3							C03S90	10.1029/2004JC002379	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2004JC002379													WOS:000244899400001

Stable isotope geochemistry of ground and surface waters associated with undisturbed massive sulfide deposits; constraints on origin of waters and water-rock reactions	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Stable isotopes (H, O, C) were determined for ground and surface waters collected from two relatively undisturbed massive sulfide deposits (Halfmile Lake and Restigouche) in the Bathurst Mining Camp (BMC), New Brunswick, Canada. Additional waters from active and inactive mines in the BMC were also collected. Oxygen and hydrogen isotopes of surface and shallow groundwaters from both the Halfimle Lake and Restigouche deposits are remarkably uniform (-13 to -14 parts per thousand and -85 to -95 parts per thousand for delta O-18(VSMOW) and delta H-2(VSMOW), respectively). These values are lighter than predicted for northern New Brunswick and, combined with elevated deuterium excess values, suggest that recharge waters are dominated by winter precipitation, recharged during spring melting. Deeper groundwaters from the Restigouche deposit, and from active and inactive mines have heavier delta O-18(VSMOW) ratios (up to -10.8 parts per thousand) than shallow groundwaters suggesting recharge under warmer climate or mixing with Shield-type brines. Some of the co-variation in Cl concentrations and delta O-18(VSMOW) ratios can be explained by mixing between saline and shallow recharge water end-members. Carbon isotopic compositions of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) are variable, ranging from -15 to -5 parts per thousand delta C-13(VPDB) for most ground and surface waters. Much of the variation in the carbon isotopes is consistent with closed system groundwater evolution involving soil zone CO2 and fracture zone carbonate minerals (calcite, dolomite and siderite; average = -6.5 parts per thousand delta C-13(VPDB)). The DIC of saline Restigouche deposit groundwater is isotopically heavy (similar to+12 parts per thousand delta C-13(VPDB)), indicating carbon isotopic fractionation from methanogenesis via CO2 reduction, consistent with the lack of dissolved sulfate in these waters and the observation of CH4-degassing during sampling.

In the hatchery, significantly more splake eggs survived from fertilization to hatching than did brookinaw eggs. but once the fish began feeding survival did not differ between the two hybrids. A total of 54,645 splake and 42,356 brookinaw were stocked in the reservoir, and over the course of the study, 92 splake and 69 brookinaw were recovered from spring and fall gill-net sets, Survival, average weight, average length. and condition factor did not significantly differ between the two hybrids for an of the 4 years. Differences in susceptibility to infection by M. cerebralis between the two hybrids were compared in the reservoir and in laboratory tests in which fish were exposed at either 5 or 10 weeks posthatch, No M, cerebralis myxospores were found in either hybrid during the first 2 year., of reservoir study, after which the prevalence ranged from 7.5% to 25% for splake and from 0% to 25% for brookinaw. Infection prevalence did not significantly differ between the two hybrids for my of the sampling periods. In controlled exposure tests, prevalence of M. cerebralis did not differ significantly between trout exposed at 5 weeks posthatch (splake = 88.4%. brookinaw = 77.1%) or at 10 weeks (splake = 100%, brookinaw = 96.4%). Our results suggest that brookinaw and splake are similar in growth, survival. and resistance to the causative agent of whirling disease after the fish reach the free-swimming fry stage. For fishery programs that rely on wild lake trout for splake production, use of brookinaw could result in significant manpower savings without compromising poststocking survival.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				AUG	2002	22	3					760	769		10.1577/1548-8675(2002)022<0760:SPARTM>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8675(2002)022<0760:SPARTM>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000177486800006

True metabolizable energy of foods consumed by lesser scaup (Aythya affinis)	WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN												The energy derived from available foods is an important factor used in conservation planning for migratory species. Estimating true metabolizable energy (TME) of available foods has become a common method for resource managers to increase reliability in energetic carrying-capacity estimates. Lesser scaup (Aythya affinis; hereafter scaup), have experienced a population decline concurrent with suspected decreases in foraging habitat quality and quantity at spring stopover sites in the upper Midwest, USA. Unfortunately, few TME estimates are available for common diet items of scaup. We estimated nitrogen-adjusted TME (TMEN) of 5 common foods of scaup by conducting feeding trials on wild females and males. True metabolizable energy varied by food taxa, but not by pretrial body mass or sex. Mean TMEN (kcal/g[dry] +/- SE) was greatest for wild millet (Echinochloa crus-galli; 2.20 +/- 0.14), followed by chironomids (Chironomus spp.; 1.41 +/- 0.49), amphipods (Gammarus spp.; 1.33 +/- 0.23), planorbid snails (Planorbidae; 0.17 +/- 0.07), and fingernail clams (Sphaeriidae; -0.79 +/- 0.27). Our results, combined with scaup diet literature indicated that the management of spring staging areas for high-energy invertebrates (i.e., chironomids and amphipods) would provide improved opportunity for energy acquisition during migration. Further study could help determine if the acclimation of scaup to particular diets, especially bivalves, increases their TME(N )values.

The data provided by the indicator role of mol ratio between major cations and some anions of water prove previous statement. The pollution of karstic underground is demonstrated with high sodium and chlorides load values of pothole waters (T(0)), which has affected the quality of spring waters (T(1)). During an annual investigation, when the period of small waters prevailed, 840 "temporary" samples taken front the pothole (T(0)) and spring (T(1)) have been sampled and analysed. Apart from the scientific knowledge the obtained data are estimated to have great importance in defining and taking necessary measures for water protection of the basin in question, which is a precondition for already defined strategy of Montenegrin's state development.																			0972-0626					DEC	2008	12	4					59	64																WOS:000265542500011

Here, we show that large meltwater-forced accelerations also occur during wintertime in Greenland. We document supraglacial lakes (SGLs) draining in cascades at unusually high elevation, causing an expansive flow acceleration over a similar to 5,200 km(2) region during winter. The three-component interferometric surface velocity field and decomposition modeling reveal the underlying flood propagation with unprecedented detail as it traveled over 160 km from the drainage site to the margin, providing novel constraints on subglacial water pathways, drainage morphology, and links with basal sliding. The triggering SGLs continuously grew over 40 years and suddenly released decades of stored meltwater, demonstrating surface melting can impact dynamics well beyond melt production. We show these events are likely common and thus their cumulative impact on dynamics should be further evaluated.

The records indicate that three main climatic regimes have occurred over the past 10350 years: 1. relatively warm and wet conditions from similar to 10350 to 8800 cal BP; 2. a warmer and wetter climate from 8800 to 3000 cal BP that was interrupted by four cold episodes at 7500, 6400, 5400, and 4400 cal BP; and 3. a dry and cool climate after similar to 3000 cal BP. These climatic changes were probably associated with a weak EASM, which was related to the latitudinal movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Other important influences include solar radiation, etc.					; Wu, Li/E-3821-2013	Zhao, Lin/0000-0002-6496-0241; Wu, Li/0000-0003-2578-2769													1040-6182	1873-4553				OCT 20	2021	599				SI		15	23		10.1016/j.quaint.2020.07.041	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2020.07.041		JUL 2021											WOS:000675451400003
J	Parra, NH; Lorenz, TJ; Schaming, TD; Scoville, A				Parra, Nancy H.; Lorenz, Teresa J.; Schaming, Taza D.; Scoville, Alison			Monitoring whitebark pine stand health in the central Washington Cascades	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST												Whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) plays a vital role in colonizing newly disturbed areas, providing shade for other tree species to germinate, and supplying food for a variety of birds and mammals, such as Clark's Nutcrackers (Nucifraga columbiana) and grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis). Decline of whitebark pine populations has been attributed to several factors, including white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola), mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) outbreaks, and fire exclusion. In 2009, the U.S. Forest Service began to install permanent plots in whitebark pine stands in Washington and Oregon as part of a Pacific Northwest restoration strategy to track blister rust and mountain pine beetle mortality. Forest Service crews conducted surveys on these plots that included standard tree inventory measurements and assessments of blister rust, mountain pine beetle, and fire activity. During summer 2020/2021, we remeasured 12 of these plots located in 3 areas of the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest (Mission Ridge, Clover Springs, and Lake Ann) and 1 area within the Ahtanum State Forest (Darland Mountain). On average, 15% of trees were newly infected by blister rust, 5% of trees died from blister rust, and 12.6% died from all causes combined in the 11-12 years between surveys. Despite this, the density of live whitebark pine trees experienced a nonsignificant increase due to regeneration, while the density of whitebark pine snags increased significantly and the density of whitebark pine seedlings decreased significantly. The percentages of trees with blister rust infection, seedlings with blister rust infection, and live trees with mountain pine beetle damage were heterogeneous over space and time. Our results help quantify parameters that are central to understanding the population dynamics of whitebark pine in the Pacific Northwest and informing management decisions, but the findings should be interpreted in light of the limited sample size and spatial extent of our data. Regular monitoring of a wider array of permanent whitebark pine plots will be critical to management of this tree species.

J	Dahl, K; Buchardt, B				Dahl, K; Buchardt, B			Monohydrocalcite in the arctic Ikka fjord, SW Greenland: First reported marine occurrence	JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH												Monohydrocalcite (MHC) has previously been known only from fresh-water and terrestrial environments. However, as documented in the present paper, MHC is a common mineral (up to 55%) in debris fragments from submarine ikaite (CaCO3 center dot 6H(2)O) tufa columns in the cold marine Ikka fjord, SW Greenland. The columns form where alkaline fresh water from submarine springs mixes with cold seawater and precipitates ikaite. Petrographical and geochemical data indicate that MHC represents a transitional diagenetic phase in the recrystallization process of metastable ikaite to final calcite. The stable-isotope data (delta C-13 and delta O-18) document a closer relationship of MHC with the precursor ikaite than with calcite. Replacement of ikaite by MHC is suggested to take place by dissolution and precipitation in a semi-closed pore-water system dominated by alkaline spring water and with only limited access of seawater. In this environment, nucleation of calcite is inhibited by phosphate ions. Apart from calcite, aragonite and hydrous Mg carbonates were also observed in the tufa debris. The Mg carbonates represent late diagenetic phases, probably formed from recrystallization of MCH in normal seawater environments.																			1527-1404	1938-3681				MAR-APR	2006	76	3-4					460	471		10.2110/jsr.2006.035	http://dx.doi.org/10.2110/jsr.2006.035													WOS:000237166100007

Both fish species fed on Daphnia pulex in 1980 and growth was rapid; prey biomass per gram of fish was 2-12 times higher for white perch than for yellow perch. In 1987, white perch consumed up to three times more prey biomass than yellow perch, but the subsequent disappearance of D. pulex caused both fish species to switch to macroinvertebrates and growth of both species declined. Between 1977 and 1987, mean weights and specific growth rates of white perch exceeded yellow perch by October in all years, and weights of white perch were closely tied to the density of D. pulex in late summer-early fall (Spearman's rank correlation = 0.58, P = 0.07). Diet overlap for age-0 white and yellow perch was high when D. pulex was present, and the potential for interspecific competition was greatest when these fish were similar in length. Because of a prolonged spawning period, age-0 white perch had a wide range in lengths, which enabled them to feed on a broad size range of prey. As a result, predation on D. pulex by white perch was exerted over a wider size range than was exerted by yellow perch. Such circumstances may allow daphnids to persist when age-0 white perch are abundant. Consequently, competitive interactions between young white and yellow perch appear to be assymmetric, because the ability of large cohorts of yellow perch to collapse Daphnia pulex populations has greater effect on white perch growth than large cohorts of white perch have on yellow perch growth.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				NOV	1990	119	6					966	975		10.1577/1548-8659(1990)119<0966:DGAPCI>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1990)119<0966:DGAPCI>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1990FG04000004

The counts with acridine orange showed an upward trend with increasing degree of enrichment of the lakes, particularly at the eutrophic end of the spectrum. The distribution pattern obtained with fluorescein diacetate was different, with an apparent upward trend in the intermediate lakes. The profundal and littoral zones of 3 lakes were examined both at the onset of thermal stratification and in late summer, when they were stratified and the hypolimnion of the eutrophic lake was anoxic. Consistently higher counts were obtained in the profundal zone, the difference being more marked in early summer. There were distinct differences between the lakes in the depth distribution of the filamentous bacteria in the sediments.																			0022-1287						1981	123	MAR					81	90																WOS:A1981LL86000009

Twelve Global Circulation Models and two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) were used to develop boundary conditions from 1950 to 2099. The model simulated the ventilation of deep water initiated by reverse stratification and subsequent thermobaric instability. All models predicted a reduction in the frequency of deep ventilation events, from an ensemble median frequency of 5.4 winters decade -1 during 1950-2005 to 4.3 (RCP4.5) or 2.5 (RCP8.5) winters decade -1 during 2045-2099. Favorable conditions for thermobaric instability-induced mixing currently occur infrequently and will become rare in the future. The salinity gradient resulting from hydrothermal inputs presents an addi-tional barrier to thermobaric instability that will continue through 2099. A redistribution of salt to the deep lake may prevent ventilation all the way to the bottom in the future. Hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen percent saturation remained above 75% within the 21st century, consistent with oligotrophy and very small oxygen demands. The rate of change in all variables accelerated approaching 2099, coincident with elimination of winter reverse stratification. Historically, about half of the hydrothermal heat added to Crater Lake has been vented to the atmosphere. In the RCP8.5 scenario, the hydrothermal heat will cease to be vented to the atmosphere by the end of the 21st century, and then the temperature of the deep waters will increase rapidly.

Benthic fluxes of dissolved oxygen and nutrients across hydrogeomorphic zones in a coastal deltaic floodplain within the Mississippi River delta plain	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												We tested the hypothesis that benthic fluxes will increase spatially in a coastal deltaic floodplain as sediment organic matter increases in response to developing hydrogeomorphic zones along a chronosequence of the active Mississippi River Delta. A continuous flow-through core system was used to incubate intact sediment cores from three hydrogeomorphic zones along a chronosequence in the emerging Wax Lake Delta (WLD). Organic matter content increased from younger to older deltaic sediments from subtidal to supratidal hydrogeomorphic zones, which were coupled with increasing benthic oxygen and nitrogen fluxes. Mean net denitrification rate in spring was 100 mu mol N-2-N m(-2) h(-1) with significantly lower rates occurring in the younger intertidal zones (T4 transect, - 22 mu mol N-2-N m(-2) h(-1)) and higher rates occurring in the older supratidal zones (T2 and T1 transects, 330 and 262 mu mol N-2-N m(-2) h(-1), respectively). Mean net denitrification rate in summer was 397 mu mol N-2-N m(-2) h(-1) without significant site-to-site variability except for the supratidal-T2 site (911 mu mol N-2-N m(-2) h(-1)) showing higher denitrification rate than the other sites. Based on seasonal temperature and inundation time, annual rates of benthic NO3- removal varied from - 0.5 to - 3.4 mol m(-2) y(-1) and N-2-N production rates varied from 1.0 to 3.2 mol N m(-2) y(-1) across WLD. The subtidal zone had the lowest fluxes associated with lower organic matter content, but was the hydrogeomorphic zone with the largest area and longest flood duration, and therefore contributed over half of N removal in WLD. The estimated annual NO3- removal of 896 Mg N y(-1) in WLD accounts for 10 to 27% of total NO3- load to WLD, most of which is converted to N-2 through denitrification. As a small prograding coastal deltaic floodplain under early stages of delta development, WLD is a continuously emerging ecosystem where the capacity of N removal increases by 0.2 to 2% per year prior to riverine NO3- is export to coastal ocean. These results highlight the contribution of the coastal deltaic floodplain in an active coastal basin in processing elevated riverine NO3- at continental margins with coastal ocean. The potential loss of this ecosystem service in N removal may increase in global significance as delta areas decline as result of accelerated relative sea level rise and decreased sediment loading in major river basins around the world.

J	Stensdotter-Blomberg, U				Stensdotter-Blomberg, U			Factors controlling pelagic populations of ciliates and heliozoans - late summer investigations in an acidic lake before and after liming	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Ciliates and heliozoans were studied in a small oligotrophic Swedish lake with the objective of investigating what controlled the community structure and population dynamics. Enclosure experiments were performed with five levels of inorganic nutrient concentrations and the presence or absence of crustacean zooplankton. The experiments were performed during the summers immediately preceding and following liming of the lake. The responses of protozooplankton to these manipulations were investigated and compared with the responses of bacterioplankton, phytoplankton and metazooplankton. In contrast to most studies on protozoan zooplankton, ciliates were determined to the lowest taxon possible, and biomasses and abundances were calculated for the different taxa. The protozooplankton biomass of the lake, expressed as summer average, did not change between the years. However, the community composition changed from smaller to larger species as the small prostomatid ciliates Urotricha and Balanion were largely replaced by oligotrichs of the genera Strombidium and Strobilidium. The experiments suggested that the protozooplankton community in the lake was controlled by metazooplankton in the acidic environment, while food limitation was the most important controlling factor after liming. Before liming, Urotricha and Balanion were unaffected by nutrient additions as well as by metazooplankton, while other ciliates and Heliozoa showed a significantly negative response to metazooplankton. After liming, Urotricha and Balanion showed a significant positive response to nutrient addition as well as to bacterioplankton biomass. A possible explanation for this response in these algivore genera is that the response was indirect and mediated through small chrysoflagellates.																			0142-7873	1464-3774				MAR	1998	20	3					423	442		10.1093/plankt/20.3.423	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/20.3.423													WOS:000072897800003

This study emphasizes the cathodoluminescence (CL) and Raman spectroscopical properties of the Tagish Lake meteorite in order to classify the meteoritic forsterite and its relation to the crystallization processes in a parent body. The CL-zoning of Tagish Lake meteorite records the thermal history of chondrules and terrestrial weathering. Only the unweathered olivine is forsterite, which is CL-active. The variation of luminescence in chondrules of Tagish Lake meteorite implies chemical inhomogeneity due to low-grade thermal metamorphism. The blue emission center in forsterite due to crystal lattice defect is proposed as being caused by rapid cooling during the primary crystallization and relatively low-temperature thermal metamorphism on the parent body of Tagish Lake meteorite. This is in a good agreement with the micro-Raman spectroscopical data. A combination of cathodoluminescence and micro-Raman spectroscopies shows some potentials in study of the asteroidal processes of parent bodies in solar system.

While the greater part of the lake remained relatively neutral, severe pH (< 5.0) and acid neutralizing capacity (ANC; < 0-mu-equiv L-1) depressions were observed in the upper (1-1.5 m) portion of the water column. Thermal stratification of the near-shore area and a combination of groundwater and surface runoff events controlled the hydrologic response and the changes in water chemistry that occurred during the acid pulse. Dilution of basic cations (SBC) combined with NO3- eluted from the snowpack and/or soils resulted in low ANC, low pH runoff affecting the near-shore area. Increases in monomeric Al and H+ were coincident with the ANC depression, creating a harmful environment for fish fry emerging from the spawning zone.

Boxelder maple leaf leachates were characterized by higher total bacterial numbers and colony numbers of heterotrophic and cellulose-decomposing bacteria than those of black alder. The higher toxicity of A. negundo aqueous extracts and leachates to charophyte cell (Nitellopsis obtusa), the inhabitant of clean lakes, were manifested at mortality and membrane depolarization levels, while the effect on H+-ATPase activity in membrane preparations from the same algae was stronger in case of A. glutinosa. Duckweed (Lemna minor), a bioindicator of eutrophic waters, was more sensitive to leaf leachates of A. glutinosa. Fallen leaves and leaf litter leachates from invasive and native species of trees, which enter water body, affect differently microbial biodestruction and aquatic vegetation in freshwater systems.

Here, we report that aquatic systems are threatened by the high toxicity and persistence of neonicotinoid insecticides. These effects cascade to higher trophic levels by altering food web structure and dynamics, affecting higher-level consumers. Using data on zooplankton, water quality, and annual fishery yields of eel and smelt, we show that neonicotinoid application to watersheds since 1993 coincided with an 83% decrease in average zooplankton biomass in spring, causing the smelt harvest to collapse from 240 to 22 tons in Lake Shinji, Shimane Prefecture, Japan. This disruption likely also occurs elsewhere, as neonicotinoids are currently the most widely used class of insecticides globally.					; YAMAMURO, Masumi/O-8027-2015	Kamiya, Hiroshi/0000-0002-1786-4003; YAMAMURO, Masumi/0000-0002-3985-4762; Kameda, Yutaka/0000-0002-1676-7885; Komuro, Takashi/0000-0003-1450-4851													0036-8075	1095-9203				NOV 1	2019	366	6465					620	+		10.1126/science.aax3442	http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aax3442								31672894					WOS:000494465700045

Yet, inconsistent hydrological records over the early Holocene from both regions hamper our understanding of hydroclimatic changes and associated mechanisms. Here we present isotopic and biomarker (alkenone) records from three Chinese lakes located at both regions to address a possible meltwater role in lake water budget. Our results show the occurrence of particularly depleted isotopic values of lake water associated with lake freshening within the deglaciation and early Holocene. Together with anomalously old C-14 dates, which were also documented in many other Asian lakes, our observations likely indicate substantial meltwater contribution to mid-latitude Asian lake water budget, along with the climatic warming. Hence, the potential meltwater effect should be considered when inferring Asian summer monsoon and westerlies behavior over this critical period, with important implications to Holocene hydrological reconstructions and future hydroclimatic projections.

The aim of this study was to isolate and characterize Arcobacter spp. from 115 different water samples (66 sewage, 25 rivers, 16 spring water, and 8 drinking water) in Izmir, Turkey. In total, 41 samples (35.7 %) were found positive for Arcobacter spp. by the genus-specific PCR. Arcobacter butzleri was detected in 39 out of 115 samples (33.9 %) including 24 sewage, 13 rivers, and 2 spring water. The remaining Arcobacter spp. (n = 2) isolates could not be identified by m-PCR and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Based on the phenotypic characterization, most of the Arcobacter species (87.8 %) indicated weak catalase activity. In addition, there were differences in phenotypic patterns among isolated species during growth at 37 A degrees C under microaerobic and aerobic conditions, in the presence of 2 % (39/41) and 3.5 % (32/41) NaCl and 0.04 % TTC (39/41) and on MacConkey agar (38/41). The results of this study indicated that environmental water samples are common sources for Arcobacter spp. Therefore, effective control measures should be taken to protect human health.																			0015-5632	1874-9356				NOV	2016	61	6					479	484		10.1007/s12223-016-0460-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12223-016-0460-0								27106697					WOS:000386351700005

Understanding and forecasting future changes in primary production (PP) in response to local and global forcing are major challenges for developing sustainable lake management. The objective of this study is to understand and characterize the mechanisms underlying the large differences in observed PP rates and nutrient concentrations between two consecutive years (2012 and 2013) in Lake Geneva, Switzerland. For this purpose, we apply a one-dimensional (1D) physical-biogeochemical model system. The Framework of Aquatic Biogeochemical models (FABM) interface is used to couple the General Ocean Turbulence Model (GOTM) with a biogeochemical model, the Ecological Regional Ocean Model (ERGOM). We calibrated GOTM, by adjusting physical parameters, with the observed temperature profiles. A model calibration method is implemented to minimize model-data misfits and to optimize the biological parameters related to phytoplankton growth dynamics. According to our results, the simulated surface mixed layer depth is deeper and heat loss from the lake and turbulent kinetic energy in the water column are much higher in winter 2012 than that in 2013, pointing to a cooling-driven, deep mixing in the lake in 2012. We found significant differences in internal phosphorus loads in the epilimnion between the two years, with estimates for 2012 being higher than those for 2013. ERGOM predicts weak nutrient limitation on phytoplankton and higher growth rates in 2012. Apparently, the deep mixing event led to high turnover of nutrients (particularly dissolved inorganic phosphate) to the productive surface layers, and a massive algal bloom developed later in the productive season. In contrary, the turnover of nutrients in 2013 was weak and consequently the PP was low. Our findings demonstrate the utility of a coupled physical-biological model framework for the investigation of the meteorological and physical controls of PP dynamics in aquatic systems.

Tracing of petroleum products in groundwater (upstream of Dez watershed to Dez dam) in order to develop a new method of risk assessment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The oil industry is one of the causes of environmental pollution by oil spills due to drilling and extraction. In case of oil leakage from oil wells to soil and then groundwater, it leads to the movement of pollutants and the spread of pollution by groundwater. In the study area, due to the existence of two oil fields, Qaleh Nar and Balaroud, upstream of Dez Dam and their inclined slope towards Dez Dam Lake, the possibility of spreading oil pollutants through groundwater to Dez Dam was investigated and the development of new risk assessment method was also performed. Water samples from groundwater and Dez dam reservoir were analyzed for total petroleum hydrocarbon concentration. A Gas Chromatograph (GC-FID) was used to measure the concentration of TPH in samples. The probability of carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic diseases has been assessed according to the EPA standard. The results revealed non-carcinogenic risk (HQ) in groundwater and in Dez reservoir respectively with the highest C10 values of 38.54 mu g/ml and 1.9 mu g/ml. The new equation was formulated with the factor of importance and C10 was taken as the most important pollutant. The results of new method (HRA) indicated non-carcinogenic risk for C10 was highest in groundwater (well: 20.7, spring 1:22.5, spring 2:8.4, and spring 3:7.09 mu g/ml) and dam reservoir in sample C (1.1 mu g/ml), exceeding the safety limit of 0.6 (in the new formula). This study confirmed the entry of TPH into the reservoir of Dez Dam through groundwater and the risk of non-carcinogenic diseases.

We present a high-resolution record of vegetation and climate changes from Lake Buridun in southern Northeast China (SNEC), spanning the last similar to 16 kyr. Multi-proxy reconstruction reveals a slight increase in precipitation prior to the end of Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1) and forest development during the middle Bolling warming, indicating that hydrothermal conditions regulated regional vegetation. Significant fluctuations in all millennial-scale climatic events underscore the high sensitivity of SNEC to climate change. Our record aligns with high-resolution data from both SNEC and North China, showing a persistent wetting trend during the Bolling-Allerod period. This trend coincides with changes in East Asian summer monsoon intensity and Indo-Pacific warm pool heat content but contrasts with the Greenland temperature records. During the HS1 and Younger Dryas, records show a cold-dry mode in SNEC, contrasting with the cold-wet pattern in central-eastern China caused by the prolonged Meiyu season, which corresponds to the retreat of the monsoon precipitation belt and an enhanced westerly jet. Our data, along with more comprehensive records from broader regions, suggest that hydroclimate in SNEC was dominated by the low-latitude monsoon and the high-latitude westerlies during the warm and cold phases of the last deglaciation, exhibiting a seesaw-like interaction.

Non-biological factors are vital to food availability in interconnected river-lake systems, so in addition to identifying the ecological response to drivers, it is also important to analyze and quantify relationships between drivers. In order to explore the impacts of these drivers on the wintering waterbirds, we selected Dongting Lake (DTL) as a study area, which is a typical interconnected river-lake system in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Floodplain. The Anatidae species, most of which are herbivorous, were chosen as the representative waterfowl. The Pearson correlation coefficient was applied to select variables related to the timing of water recession and food availability, which have significant influences on the Anatidae. Then, the structural equation model (SEM) was carried out to quantify the relationships among the food availability, hydrological variables, and climatic variables. The results showed that unseasonably early or late water recession had a negative impact on the diversity of the Anatidae, and in particular affected population dynamics of the Lesser White-fronted goose Anser erythropus. Significant changes in Anatidae populations in DTL occurred in response to maximum NDVI (r = 0.53, p<0.01) and the interval time of water recession (r = -0.43, p<0.1). Water level, flow, and interval time of water recession explained 71% of maximum NDVI in DTL. In addition, hydraulic interactions between the mainstream and each lake jointly affected the inundation pattern and the vegetation growth stage oldie lake after the flood season, thus affecting foraging suitability. Our findings suggest that water compensation should be carried out within an appropriate range of hydraulic gradient to optimize the time of water recession and improve the suitability of the habitat effectively.

Water analysis performed over a period of four years show maximum boron concentrations of 451 mg/l. An area of 250 km y is heavily polluted. The tectonically strongly disturbed metamorphic and sedimentary rocks in this region provide good pathways for the circulation of fluids. The hydrothermal system consists mainly of Na-(SO4)-HCO3. The occurrence of boron can be attributed to the interaction of magmatic fluids, related to young volcanic activities in this area. They seem to be the result of an intensive fluid-rock interaction with the metamorphic host-rock, e. g. tourmaline rich gneiss. Hot fluids in the depth of the study area migrate through the fractured rocks and may leach boron during their path to the surface. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Different ranges of isotopic values were recorded for different water types: hot springs show delta O-18 -3.36 to +3.69 and delta D -15.85 to +24.23, deep Aluto-Langano geothermal wells show delta O-18 -4.65 to -1.24 and delta D -12.39 to -9.31, groundwater wells show delta O-18 -3.99 to +5.14 and delta D -19.69 to +32.27, whereas the lakes show delta O-18 and delta D in the range +3.98 to +7.92 and +26.19 to +45.71, respectively. The intersection of the Local Meteoric Water Line (LMWL: delta D = 7 delta O-18 + 11.2, R-2 = 0.94, n = 42) and the Local Evaporation Line (LEL: delta D = 5.63 delta O-18 + 8, n = 14, R-2=0.82) was used to estimate the average isotopic composition of recharge water into the basin (delta D = -5.15 and delta O-18 = -2.34). These values are depleted if compared with the modern-day average precipitation, presumably indicating paleo-groundwater components recharged during previous humid climatic phases. The measured stable isotope values indicate that the geothermal wells, some of the hot springs and groundwater wells mainly consist of meteoric water. The Sr isotopic signatures in all waters are within the range of the Sr isotopic composition of the rift basalts and rhyolites. The variability of Sr isotopic data also pinpoints complex water-rock interaction and mixing processes in groundwater and surface water. The Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio ranges from 0.70445 to 0.70756 in the hot springs, from 0.70426 to 0.70537 in two deep geothermal wells, and from 0.70673 to 0.70721 in the rift lakes Ziway, Langano, Shala and Awasa. The radiogenic composition recorded by the lakes indicates that the input water was predominantly affected by progressive interaction with rhyolitic volcanics and lacustrine sediments. There is a change in MER water composition between the recharge-infiltration zone (surrounding highlands) and the discharge areas, from depleted delta D, delta O-18 and less radiogenic Sr isotope compositions to enriched delta D, delta O-18 and more radiogenic Sr isotope compositions. Isotope analyses are therefore useful in providing further understanding of the hydrologeological processes occurring within a productive aquifer and the surface water system. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the long-term spatiotemporal dynamics of lake TSM in China and their response to natural and anthropogenic factors are rarely explored. In this study, based on Landsat top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance embedded in GEE and in-situ TSM data collecting in the periods 2014-2020, we developed a unified empirical model (R2 = 0.87, RMSE = 10.16 mg/L, and MAPE = 38.37 %) to retrieve the autumn TSM of lakes at national scale. This model exhibited stable and reliable performances through transferability validation and comparative analysis with published TSM models, and was implemented to generate autumn TSM maps for large lakes (& GE;50 km2) across China during 1990-2020.We found that 78.03 % of large lakes with TSM < 20 mg/L were dominant in 2020 across China, and these lakes were mainly located in the plateau and mountain regions. In the first gradient terrain (FGT) and second gradient terrain (SGT), the number of lakes showing significant (p < 0.05) decreasing TSM trends increased from 1990-2004 to 2004-2020, while those with opposite directions in TSM decreased. Lakes in the third gradient terrain (TGT) exhibited the inverse quantitative change in these two TSM trends compared with the FGT and SGT. A relative contribution analysis at the watershed level indicated that the first two leading factors that control TSM significant change in the FGT were lake area and wind speed, in the SGT were lake area and NDVI, and in the TGT were population and NDVI, respectively. The impacts of anthropogenic factors on lakes are continuing, particularly in eastern China, and more efforts are needed to improve and protect the water environment in the future. Our findings might help water resource managers better grasp the current state of water quality.

J	Qian, KM; Dokulil, M; Chen, YW				Qian, Kuimei; Dokulil, Martin; Chen, Yuwei			Do the regular annual extreme water level changes affect the seasonal appearance of Anabaena in Poyang Lake?	PEERJ												Background: Poyang Lake is an ecosystem experiencing annual variations in water level of up to 14 m. Water level changes were 8.03 and 11.22 m, respectively, in the years 2013 and 2014. The biomass and heterocyst frequency of Anabaena increased in the summers of recent years. Methods: A weekly to bi-weekly monitoring from June to November 2013 and 2014 was set up to explain the variations of Anabaena appearance in different phases of the water level. Results: Anabaena was present in the lake throughout the year. The average relative biomass of Anabaena in the present study was over 40%, being most abundant in summer. The average heterocyst frequency was 0.23% in 2013 and 0.76% in 2014. Correlation analysis indicated a positive trend of Anabaena biomass with water temperature and water level and a negative one with total nitrogen (TN), which is the reason for the increase of heterocyst frequency in 2013 and 2014. Heterocyst frequency of Anabaena was positively correlated with water temperature, water level and PO4-P, and negatively with dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN/DIP), NO3-N and TN. Moreover, water temperature and DIN/DIP were significantly correlated with water level, indicating that water level changes have a direct effect on Anabaena and heterocyst formation in Poyang Lake. Conclusions: The results of this study support the hypothesis that increasing biomass and heterocyst formation of Anabaena can be primarily caused by seasonal changes of the water level in Poyang Lake.					陈, 雨薇/HKF-1175-2023; Dokulil, Martin/J-3464-2019														2167-8359					APR 12	2019	7								e6608	10.7717/peerj.6608	http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.6608								30997284					WOS:000464303500002

Remedial measures to reduce external P loads, and lower in-lake P concentrations from 600 mg/m3 to much lower values of 100 mg/m3, resulted in reduction long-term (several years average) mean and maximum open-water summer chlorophyll-a concentrations. Despite application of these remedial measures, perturbations in phytoplankton biomass remained; on any particular day during open-water period, short-term algal blooms or scums were still sufficiently intense for long-term improvements not to be clearly evident to the casual recreational user of the lake.																			0143-148X						1980	1	3					217	231		10.1016/0143-148X(80)90012-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0143-148X(80)90012-9													WOS:A1980KA83700004

It has always been challenging to determine its long-term variation, due to the lack of data on species distribution and broad wetland observation. In this study, the key normalized difference vegetation index threshold range suitable for herbivorous geese, greater white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons, GWG) and bean geese (Anser fabalis, BG), was discovered by combining GPS tracking data with Landsat satellite data. The suitable habitat area and distribution variation characteristics of GWG and BG from 1982 to 2020 were extracted based on the threshold range. The results showed that the suitable habitat area had a declining trend after 2003, that the distribution had moved toward the lake's center, and that its average elevation had decreased by around 1 m, particularly during the arrival period. The change of herbivorous geese habitat is caused by the continuous drying of Poyang Lake. The study can offer a rational scientific foundation for wetland waterbird protection and watershed hydrological management.

J	Baumann, A; Hewitt, A				Baumann, Anne; Hewitt, Alison			Recruitment of Melaleuca quinquenervia (Myrtaceae) in the fringing forests of the Myall Lakes, NSW, Australia	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Context. Melaleuca quinquenervia is a widespread, keystone species of eastern Australian coastal forested wetlands. Populations of M. quinquenervia in the fringes of Myall Lakes, New South Wales, Australia exhibit low numbers of juveniles, infrequent recruitment and a dominance of mature individuals, raising concerns about stand replacement from conservation managers. In contrast, M. quinquenervia often recruits in large numbers and is highly invasive in wetlands around the world. Aims. To explore factors that limit recruitment of M. quinquenervia within its native range. Methods. Field deployed seed traps; soil-core sampling; a burial longevity trial and depth of emergence experiment; laboratory temperature, salinity and light germination experiments; a transplantation experiment; monitoring of field germination; and a litter/leachate experiment. Key results. Low seed viability (5-26%) is offset by high canopy seed loads (250 000 to 120 million seeds per tree) released continuously throughout the year with a peak fall in summer (2000 to 5000 viable seeds per m(2) per month), coinciding with optimal germination temperatures. Seedling emergence is reduced below 5 mm soil depth, there is a very low soil seedbank reserve, and germination is light dependant. M. quinquenervia exhibited reduced germination percentage and rate as well as reduced survival of seedlings at salinities higher than 15 dS m(-1) EC (electrical conductivity). The most favourable sites for seedling establishment are permanently moist with low salinity, protected from wave action via sedge vegetation, and sheltered from prevailing winds. There is an inhibitory effect of Casuarina leachate on germination. Conclusions. Germination in the field is episodic, and tied to specific environmental conditions. Highest losses occur at the seedling establishment phase. Implications. Future research avenues and management recommendations are provided.

J	Kim, Y				Kim, Yongwon			Effect of thaw depth on fluxes of CO2 and CH4 in manipulated Arctic coastal tundra of Barrow, Alaska	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Changes in CO2 and CH4 emissions represent one of the most significant consequences of drastic climate change in the Arctic, by way of thawing permafrost a deepened active layer, and decline of thermokarst lakes in the Arctic. This study conducted flux-measurements of CO2 and CH4, as well as environmental factors such as temperature, moisture, and thaw depth, as part of a water table manipulation experiment in the Arctic coastal plain tundra of Barrow, Alaska during autumn. The manipulation treatment consisted of draining, controlling,,and flooding treated sections by adjusting standing water. Inundation increased CH4 emission by a factor of 4.3 compared to non-flooded sections. This may be due to the decomposition of organic matter under a limited oxygen environment by saturated standing water. On the other hand, CO2 emission in the dry section was 3.9 similar to fold higher than in others. CH4 emission tends to increase with deeper thaw depth, which strongly depends on the water table; however, CO2 emission is not related to thaw depth. Quotients of global warming potential (GWPCO(2)) (dry/control) and GWPCH(4) (wet/control) increased by 464 and 148%, respectively, and GWPCH(4) (dry/control) declined by 66%. This suggests that CO2 emission in a drained section is enhanced by soil and ecosystem respiration, and CH4 emission in a flooded area is likely stimulated under an anoxic environment by inundated standing water. The findings of this manipulation experiment during the autumn period demonstrate the different production processes of CO2 and CH4, as well as different global warming potentials, coupled with change in thaw depth. Thus the outcomes imply that the expansion of tundra lakes leads the enhancement of CH4 release, and the disappearance of the lakes causes the stimulated CO2 production in response to the Arctic climate change.

Formation of year zones sometimes failed in scales, opercula and otoliths from old, slow-growing fish. Immature whitefish showed very rapid growth; mean lengths at 1st and 2nd winters were 15.7 and 25.9 cm, respectively. After reaching maturity (mainly during the 4th yr), growth slowed down. The age determination revealed large fluctuations in year-class strength, indicating failing recruitment in recent years. Comparisons with data from the 1st half of this century showed a large decrease in population size and yield during the last 50 yr. The advancing eutrophication of the lake during the same period is supposed to be responsible for the reduction of the stock. Good correlation was found between the degree of O2 deficiency during winter and the strength of corresponding year-classes.																			0029-6864						1976	24	4					379	405																WOS:A1976CS78700016

For this purpose, we analyzed the C-14 content of aragonite of living Melanopsis shells from different freshwater bodies of the northern Jordan Valley and Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee) and compared them to the contemporaneous water values. The Melanopsis shells are in C-14 equilibrium with their habitat waters, allowing to specify a particular reservoir age for various water types. We measured similar to 750 yr for Lake Kinneret, similar to 2300 yr for northern Jordan, similar to 4600 yr for springs in the north Kinneret, and similar to 7200 yr for streams flowing directly from carbonate aquifers. These results were tested and corroborated by analyzing fossil Melanopsis shells of known age, measured on contemporaneous organic matter. We conclude that Melanopsis shells are reliable C-14 chronometers and have the potential to be used as paleohydrological tracers.

In this article, we present analyses on the ethnobotanical and zoological remains recently recovered from the Spring Lake Tract, Cahokia, a neighborhood populated from approximately AD 900 to 1275. The assemblage represents a variety of plants and animals that demonstrate the diverse utility of the biota from the region. We conclude that this assemblage indicates that this neighborhood community participated in an array of practices not easily dichotomized into "ritual" or "domestic." From the perspectives of "Place-Thought" and locality, we emphasize the agency of these entities (plant/animal/human) in the process of creating and sustaining this Cahokian neighborhood.

Vertical profile of fluorescent characteristics in Baikal water in the spring period of 2010-2016.	23RD INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEAN OPTICS: ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS	Proceedings of SPIE				23rd International Symposium on Atmospheric and Ocean Optics - Atmospheric Physics	JUL 03-07, 2017	Irkutsk, RUSSIA	Russian Acad Sci, Siberian Branch, V E Zuev Inst Atmospher Opt, Russian Acad Sci, Siberian Branch, Inst Solar Terrestrial Phys, Fed Agcy Sci Org, Russian Fdn Basic Res				The photosynthesis plays an important role in the spatiotemporal variability of the content of dissolved gases and biogenic elements in Baikal water. At the same time, the sampling of representative water samples for analysis with the use of direct methods for measurement of the biomass of plankton algae and the intensity of photosynthesis in the entire lake depth (maximum depth exceeds 600 m) is connected with many technical and material difficulties. To a certain extent, they can complement the express methods of fluorescent analysis. This work continues the study of the influence of physical, hydrological, chemical, and biological processes on the CO2 exchange in the "water-atmosphere" system of Lake Baikal. The aim of this work was to examine the spatial (vertical and horizontal) distribution of fluorescent characteristics obtained in spring voyages of combined research expeditions all over the Baikal water area in 2010-2016.

We used eDNA for surveying 5 endangered spring-endemic species at Bitter Lake National Wildlife Refuge, Chaves County, New Mexico, USA. Water samples (n = 40) in spring systems were evaluated in July 2018 for presence of residual DNA for Gambusia nobilis, Gammarus desperatus, Juturnia kosteri, Pyrgulopsis roswellensis, and Assiminea pecos. We detected eDNA at 50% of sites for G. nobilis, 42.5% of sites for J. kosteri, 27.5% of sites for P. roswellensis, 20% of sites for G. desperatus and did not detect A. pecos eDNA at any of the sites. We also examined the habitat conditions that drive patterns in occupancy for these endangered species and developed thresholds for habitat parameters to inform conservation decisions. Salinity and dissolved oxygen influenced sample occupancy for G. desperatus, P. roswellensis, and J. kosteri, but only dissolved oxygen influenced sample occupancy for G. nobilis. Results highlighted the efficacy of using eDNA to monitor 4 of the 5 spring-endemic species and provided insight to the habitat preferences for each species, which will help drive conservation activities.					; Johnson, William/G-7733-2011	Butler, Matthew/0000-0001-9864-803X; 													1863-5407	1613-4796				JAN 23	2025	56						27	39		10.3354/esr01379	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/esr01379													WOS:001426000100001

Since we used a large-mesh net, the net sample phytoplankton were primarily represented by the large elongated diatom Synedra acus. subsp. radians (Kutzing) Skabichevskij. The similar algae composition of net samples of spring season phytoplankton collected at different sites of the lake allows us to compare results of the fatty acid analysis of these samples. The phytoplankton diversity of the sedimentation samples was contrary represented by 32 algae species. There are clear changes in the fatty acid composition of net phytoplankton exposed to anthropogenic impacts of varying intensity. The content of polyunsaturated fatty acids in phytoplankton collected from central stations (pelagic stations at a distance of ~10-30 km from the shoreline) without anthropogenic impact was higher by up to 15% than phytoplankton collected from nearshore stations (littoral stations at a distance of ~0.01-0.05 km from the shoreline) and offshore stations (pelagic stations at a distance of ~3 km from the shoreline). The interlaboratory precision of fatty acid determination of phytoplankton is estimated as <= 10%. We found high content of the lipid peroxidation marker (80-340 mu g g(-1) of dry weight) in phytoplankton from nearshore and offshore stations with intensive anthropogenic impact. In phytoplankton from central stations, we did not find any lipid peroxidation. Determination of unsaturated fatty acids, coupled with analysis of fatty acid peroxidation products, can be used to evaluate the level of anthropogenic impact in terms of ecological health and biodiversity conservation.

J	Torghabeh, AK; Pradhan, B; Jahandari, A				Torghabeh, Amir Karimian; Pradhan, Biswajeet; Jahandari, Ashkan			Assessment of geochemical and sedimentological characteristics of atmospheric dust in Shiraz, southwest Iran	GEOSCIENCE FRONTIERS												Geogenic dust is commonly believed to be one of the most important environmental problems in the Middle East. The present study investigated the geochemical characteristics of atmospheric dust particles in Shiraz City (south of Iran). Atmospheric dust samples were collected through a dry collector method by using glass trays at 10 location sites in May 2018. Elemental composition was analysed through inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. Meteorological data showed that the dustiest days were usually in spring and summer, particularly in April. X-ray diffraction analysis of atmospheric dust samples indicated that the mineralogical composition of atmospheric dust was calcite + dolomite (24%)>palygorskite (18%)>quartz (14%)>muscovite (13%)>albite (11%)>kaolinite (7%)>gypsum (7%)>zircon = anatase (3%). The high occurrence of palygorskite (16%-23%) could serve as a tracer of the source areas of dust storms from the desert of Iraq and Saudi Arabia to the South of Iran. Scanning electron microscopy indicated that the sizes of the collected dust varied from 50 mu m to 0.8 mu m, but 10 mu m was the predominant size. The atmospheric dust collected had prismatic trigonal-rhombohedral crystals and semi-rounded irregular shapes. Moreover, diatoms were detected in several samples, suggesting that emissions from dry-bed lakes, such as Hoor Al-Azim Wetland (located in the southwest of Iran), also contributed to the dust load. Backward trajectory simulations were performed at the date of sampling by using the NOAA HYSPLIT model. Results showed that the sources of atmospheric dust in the study area were the eastern area of Iraq, eastern desert of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Khuzestan Province. The Ca/Al ratio of the collected samples (1.14) was different from the upper continental crust (UCC) value (UCC = 0.37), whereas Mg/Al (0.29), K/Al (0.22) and Ti/Al (0.07) ratios were close to the UCC value (0.04). This condition favours desert calcisols as the main mineral dust sources. Analysis of the crustal enrichment factor (EFcrustal) revealed geogenic sources for V, Mo, Pb, Sr, Cu and Zn (<2), whereas anthropogenic sources affected As, Cd, Cr and Ni.

Deep-water areas of lakes potentially yield high resolution, continuous records of sedimentation and lake-level changes. In contrast, the marginal areas of lake basins accumulate sediment in a wave-dominated, highenergy environment and may be more sensitive to lake-level changes than deep-water environments, but they might also be more affected by sedimentary hiatuses. Here, we present grain-size data from two sections of exposed nearshore sediments of Dali Lake, North China, and compare them with previously published results from a sediment core from the lake center. We used the grain size-standard deviation method to distinguish various grains-size components of the nearshore sediments, and compared the results with those from surface sediments from various depths in order to investigate past lake-level changes. Combining the grain-size results with a radiocarbon chronology, we defined four lake-level stages during the Holocene: (1) An intermediate lake level from early Holocene to 10.0 cal ka BP. (2) A high lake level from 10.0 to 6.6 cal ka BP. (3) A decline to an intermediate lake level from 6.6 to 1.0 cal ka BP. (4) An abrupt fall to a low lake level from 1.0 cal ka BP to the present when the marginal section was covered with eolian sand. Our results indicate that the total amplitude of lake-level variation during the Holocene was greater than 45 m. This record of lake-level change is in good agreement with previous results obtained from the lake center, and it indicates that the grain-size standard deviation method may be well suited for lake-level reconstruction from nearshore sediments. Moreover, the marginal sections provide evidence of an abrupt short-lived lake-level decline more clearly than the deep-water core.																			0921-2728	1573-0417				OCT	2016	56	2-3					123	135		10.1007/s10933-016-9899-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-016-9899-x													WOS:000383989300003

About 75% of the females possessed a 3.4.4.4 spine formula; 8%, 2.3.3.3 and 17% an anomalous formula. Eighty-one percent of the males had a 3.4.4.4 formula; 7%, 2.3.3.3 and 12% were anomalous. Morphological variation, and breeding experiments performed by Price (1958) suggest that A. robustus and A. vernalis as defined by Kiefer (1976) are likely species complexes, rather than just two species.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				AUG 19	1986	139	2					127	133		10.1007/BF00028096	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00028096													WOS:A1986E176400005

A metalimnetic oxygen maximum was present from mid-July through mid-August at Site 1, the most eutrophic of the lake's three basins, coinciding with high metalimnetic chlorophyll concentrations and peak densities of cyanobacteria and diatoms. The oxygen maxima were located approximately 2 m higher in the metalimnion than the chlorophyll maximum. After mid-August, peak algal densities shifted to the epilimnion and the oxygen maximum disappeared. A metalimnetic ammonium maximum was present at Site 4, the most oligotrophic basin, throughout the summer, coinciding with high counts for metabolically active bacteria. The ammonium maxima appeared to be caused by an excess rate of aerobic decomposition of organic matter raining from the photic zone compared to the rate of nitrification. The ammonium maxima were somewhat linked to the location of the chlorophyll maxima.																			0029-344X					WIN	2008	82	1					18	29		10.3955/0029-344X-82.1.18	http://dx.doi.org/10.3955/0029-344X-82.1.18													WOS:000253880300003

Forensic autopsies were carried out on three of the four men, who died soon after the incident. From autopsy findings, the cause of death was diagnosed to be suffocation after aspirating seawater in the three victims. To clarify why the men fell into the lake, a chemical analysis for hydrogen sulfide was carried out using the extractive alkylation technique combined with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.

This averaged distribution was based on the 2.5-year database of 48-h dust forecasts produced by the dust prediction system, which had been developed earlier at the University of Athens and subsequently modified in Tel Aviv University. The performed climatological analysis is the first one based on a large archive of dust distribution over the whole Sahara and vicinity regions; the total amount of vertical profiles in this at-chive is approximately 10(7) per year. Vertical distributions of dust reflect differences between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean dust transport. As a whole, the Mediterranean dust is found to be within a wider range of altitudes, penetrating rattler higher into the troposphere. On average, dust over the Atlantic penetrates up to less than or equal to 5 km while over the Mediterranean up to less than or equal to 8 km. The characteristic feature of dust vertical profiles over the main Saharan dust source near Lake Chad is its maximal concentration near the surface. From April to June averaged profiles over the Chad basin in the Sahara are restricted below the level of similar to 4.5 km. In the winter months and in March, dust concentration over the Chad basin is closer to the surface, under 1.5 km. Dust also maximizes near the surface over another dust source, which is the major one in summer, located in West Africa. These results are consistent with dust-layer altitude ranges from present-day lidar soundings. Besides, the results are in accordance with general synoptic knowledge of the mechanism of dust transport to the Mediterranean. However, only quantitative comparisons of model vertical profiles against lidar measurements, which are under way now, call validate the forecast vertical distribution of Saharan dust.

At all of these sites the hydrothermal phenomena are believed to be as yet unaffected by human activity, though much of the data collection was driven by mandates to collect environmental-baseline data in anticipation of geothermal development. The time series average 19 years in length and some of the Yellowstone sites have been monitored intermittently for over 30 years. Many sites show strong seasonality but few show clear long-term trends, and at most sites statistically significant decadal-scale trends are absent. Thus, the data provide robust estimates of advective heat flow ranging from similar to130 MW in the north-central Oregon Cascades to similar to6100 MW in the Yellowstone region, and also document Yellowstone hydrothermal chloride and arsenic fluxes of 1740 and 15-20 g/s, respectively. The discharge time series show little sensitivity to regional tectonic events such as earthquakes or inflation/deflation cycles. Most long-term monitoring to date has focused on high-chloride springs and low-temperature fumaroles. The relative stability of these features suggests that discharge measurements done as part of volcano-monitoring programs should focus instead on high-temperature fumaroles, which may be more immediately linked to the magmatic heat source.

It is essential to recognize various GSMs for potential geothermal energy exploration. However, there is a lack of work to fulfill this task using deep learning (DL), which has achieved unprecedented successes in computer vision and image interpretation. This study aims to explore the feasibility of using a DL model to fulfill the recognition of GSMs with photographs. A new image dataset was created for the GSM recognition by preprocessing and visual interpretation with expert knowledge and a high-quality check after downloading images from the Internet. The dataset consists of seven GSM types, i.e., warm spring, hot spring, geyser, fumarole, mud pot, hydrothermal alteration, crater lake, and one type of none GSM, including 500 images of different photographs for each type. The recognition results of the GoogLeNet model were compared with those of three machine learning (ML) algorithms, i.e., Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), by using the assessment metrics of overall accuracy (OA), overall F-1 score (OF), and computational time (CT) for training and testing the models via cross-validation. The results show that the retrained GoogLeNet model using transfer learning has significant advantages of accuracies and performances over the three ML classifiers, with the highest OA, the biggest OF, and the fastest CT for both the validation and test. Correspondingly, the three selected ML classifiers perform poorly for this task due to their low OA, small OF, and long CT. This suggests that transfer learning with a pretrained network be a feasible method to fulfill the recognition of the GSMs. Hopefully, this study provides a reference paradigm to help promote further research on the application of state-of-the-art DL in the geothermics domain.					; Xiong, Yongzhu/GZL-9116-2022; Li, yongyi/ISR-8772-2023; chen, yankui/MGU-4185-2025; LI, Yongyi/ISR-8772-2023	Xiong, Yongzhu/0000-0002-4417-6409; Li, yongyi/0000-0003-2032-2069; Mingyong, Zhu/0000-0001-6849-1692														1996-1073				APR	2022	15	8							2913	10.3390/en15082913	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en15082913													WOS:000786026900001

Both physical and biogeochemical processes occurring during this episode were assessed. The dominant effect was a decrease of nutrient concentrations along the river-lake ecotone. This phenomenon seemed mainly linked to biological factors: stimulation of the spring algal and bacterial growth. After the flood, the algae aggregated with allochthonous particles brought by the river and were rapidly eliminated by sedimentation. The effect of this early spring flood, seemed spatially restricted and rather neutral as regards lake water quality. In the lake region crossed by the river plume, the overall effect after the flood was a decrease of P available for the phytoplankton. In the open water, the P concentration was probably not modified by the load supplied by the hood.					; Vinçon-Leite, Brigitte/Y-1396-2019; Tassin, Bruno/AAW-3517-2021	TASSIN, Bruno/0000-0003-2586-4270; BOURNET, Pierre-Emmanuel/0000-0001-9625-5937; Vincon Leite, Brigitte/0000-0002-0190-0209													0018-8158	1573-5117					1998	374						361	377																WOS:000076609900029
J	Rabow, S; Johansson, E; Carlsson, P; Rengefors, K				Rabow, Sandra; Johansson, Emma; Carlsson, Per; Rengefors, Karin			Unexpected shift from cyanobacterial to dinoflagellate dominance due to a summer drought	HARMFUL ALGAE												The ruling paradigm is that future climate change scenarios will lead to an increase in the frequency, intensity, and duration of cyanobacterial blooms across the globe. It was therefore unexpected when, during an unusually warm and dry summer in southern Sweden in 2018, cyanobacteria did not dominate the phytoplankton community of the temperate Lake Vombsjo<spacing diaeresis>n known for toxic cyanobacterial blooms. Instead, a potentially toxic dinoflagellate, Naiadinium polonicum, formed a large bloom and was dominant for the entire season. Dinoflagellates share important functional traits with cyanobacteria, but few studies have considered competition between dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria under future climate change scenarios. In order to understand the underlying factors leading to the N. polonicum bloom in 2018, we designed a study of Lake Vombsjo<spacing diaeresis>n for an additional two years. When compared with subsequent years, 2018 was defined by an extended period of thermal stratification and hypoxia near the sediment surface. A significant positive relationship was also identified between N. polonicum biomass and both surface water temperature and soluble reactive phosphorus. We therefore suggest that the combination of higher temperatures and higher water column stability benefitted N. polonicum more so than cyanobacteria. Given that these factors are generally associated with cyanobacterial success, we conclude that freshwater phytoplankton community composition in temperate lakes can take different pathways in a warmer world.					; Rengefors, Karin/K-5873-2019; Johansson, Emma/L-8304-2016	Rengefors, Karin/0000-0001-6297-9734; Johansson, Emma/0000-0001-5300-9672; Rabow, Sandra/0009-0009-4097-3353; 													1568-9883	1878-1470				FEB	2025	142								102787	10.1016/j.hal.2024.102787	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2024.102787		DEC 2024						39947863					WOS:001395756500001

Focusing on the Laurentian Great Lakes, we challenge this common assumption by showing that the thermal behaviour is diversified in time both among different lakes and within a single one. Deep regions experience a stronger warming concentrated in early summer, mainly due to anticipated stratification, while shallow parts respond more uniformly throughout the year. To perform such analysis, we use the difference between the five warmest and coldest years in a series of 20 years as a proxy of possible effects of climate alterations, and compare the warming of lake surface temperature with that of air temperature. In this way, based on past observations obtained from satellite images, we show how the warming is heterogeneously distributed in time and in space, and that the quantification of lakes' thermal response to climate change is chiefly influenced by the time window used in the analysis. Should we be more careful when considering averaged indicators of lake thermal response to climate change?

Various optimization parameters for Ni(II) determination, such as pH, eluent type and concentration, sample and eluent flow rates, amount of adsorbent, were investigated to obtain better sensitivity, accuracy, precision and quantitative recovery. Furthermore, the interference effects of some ions on the recovery efficiency of Ni(II) were also investigated. The optimum experimental parameters were obtained in the case of pH 1; 5 mL of 4 mol L-1 HCl for eluent and 0.3 g for the adsorbent amount. The limit of detection was found to be 0.58 mu g L-1 and linearity ranged from 5 to 50 g L-1. The accuracy of the method was tested by the certified reference material of TMDA-70.2 Ontario Lake Water at a 95% confidence level.

Induced altitude acclimatization may decrease susceptibility to acute mountain sickness (AMS). We aimed to exam the effects of acclimatization at 1520m on susceptibility to AMS during a subsequent rapid ascent to 3658m. Methods: Rate pressure product (RPP), oxygen saturation (SpO2) and vascular tone, quantified by the reflection index (RI) obtained using photoplethysmography (PPG) technique, were studied in fifty-five participants ascending to 3658m from 300 and 1520m defined as Group A and B respectively. AMS occurrence was evaluated by the Lake Louise Score (LLS) system. Results: Seventeen of the fifty-five participants were diagnosed with AMS. The incidence and severity were lower in Group B than Group A. On initial exposure, we observed a significant increase of RPP and a significant decrease of SpO2. Inside each group, either A or B, RI exhibited a quick and dramatic fall followed by an early recovery back to normal in subjects without AMS but a blunted and slow fall followed by a delayed recovery in subjects with AMS. A moderate level of inverse correlation was found between degree of fall (Delta) in SpO2 and RI within 24 hours. Conclusions: The induced altitude acclimatization provided low-altitude residents in certain degree benefit in prevention of AMS during a subsequent rapid ascent to high altitude. The comparison of data between participants with and without an induced altitude acclimatization exhibited physiological significance during acute phase response after a rapid ascend to altitude.					luo, xiaomin/HNS-7206-2023														2471-7819		978-1-5090-3834-3				2016							289	292		10.1109/BIBE.2016.41	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/BIBE.2016.41													WOS:000391847500048

Transfer of carbon dioxide and methane through the soil-water-atmosphere system at Mer Bleue peatland, Canada	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Surface waters associated with peatlands, supersaturated With CO2 and CH4 with respect to the atmosphere, act as important pathways linking a large and potentially unstable global repository of C to the atmosphere. Understanding the drivers and mechanisms which control C release from peatland systems to the atmosphere will contribute to better management and modelling of terrestrial C pools. We used non-dispersive infra-red (NDIR) CO2 sensors to continuously measure gas concentrations in a beaver pond at Mer Bleue peatland (Canada): measurements were made between July and August 2007. Concentrations of CO2 in the surface water (10 cm) reached 13 mg, C l(-1) (epCO(2) 72) and 26 mg C l(-1) (epCO(2) 133) at depth (60 cm). The study also showed large diurnal fluctuations in dissolved CO2 which ranged in amplitude from similar to 1.6 mg C l(-1) at 10 cm to similar to 0.2 mg C l(-1) at 60 cm depth. CH4 concentration and supersaturation (epCH(4)) measured using headspace analysis averaged 1-47 mg C l(-1) and 3252, respectively: diurnal cycling was also evident in CH4 concentrations. Mean estimated evasion rates of CO2 and CH4 over file summer period were 44.92 +/- 7.86 and 0.44 +/- 0.25 mu g C m(-2)s(-1), respectively. Open water at Mer Bleue is a significant summer hotspot for greenhouse gas emissions within the catchment. Our results suggest that CO2 concentrations during the Summer in beaver ponds at Mer Bleue are strongly influenced by biological processes within the water column involving aquatic plants and algae (in situ photosynthesis and respiration). In terms of carbon cycling soil-stream connectivity at this time of, Year is therefore relatively weak. Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

There was also significant variation in how lice were distributed around the body regions of the hosts. Aims To identify the species of lice found on the Common Moorhen, evaluate the seasonal variation in their intensity of infestation and determine spatial distribution on the hosts. Methods Eighty-six Common Moorhens were captured, examined for lice, and released from December 2018 to February 2020 at Lake Tonga, Algeria. Lice were extracted, preserved in 70% ethanol, cleared, and mounted in Canada balsam for identification. The population mean intensity and prevalence of lice species were calculated for each season. Data were inspected using descriptive statistical tools, such as principal component analysis, to explore spatial dispersion on the body regions of the hosts. Results Five louse species were identified: Pseudomenopon pilosum, Rallicola minutus, Laemobothrion chloropodis, Fulicoffula sp, and Incidifrons gallinulae, with percentages of prevalence of 79.07%, 70.93%, 56.98%, 40.70%, and 23.26%, respectively. Their prevalence varied significantly across months, with a peak in the winter. Louse species were non-randomly distributed across the body regions of the hosts. Conclusion This study documents the distribution and diversity of chewing lice on the Common Moorhen for the first time in Algeria and establishes a baseline dataset for further monitoring studies.					; Dik, Bilal/J-8576-2019; Ziani, borhane/AAD-6965-2021; LAZLI, Amel/KBQ-6262-2024	Lazli, Amel/0000-0001-9929-7198; Dik, Bilal/0000-0002-7553-5611; Faiza, Marniche/0000-0002-3309-4811; 													0006-3657	1944-6705				JUL 3	2021	68	3					359	369		10.1080/00063657.2022.2092593	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00063657.2022.2092593		JUL 2022											WOS:000821019600001

However, the processes and forcing mechanisms of dust activity in inland Asia during the Holocene are still debated due to the lack of high-quality records with accurate dating, unambiguous dust signals, and a high resolution. Here we present a well-dated record of dust activity based on the Ti content of the sediments of Shuanghu Lake, in the southern Altai Mountains, with a similar to 15-yr-resolution and covering the entire Holocene. This record shows a gradual decrease in dust intensity during similar to 11.7-6 thousand years ago (ka), followed by a persistent increase since similar to 6 ka. Frequent dust events are also evident, lasting hundreds of years, and are superimposed on the millennial-scale trend, corresponding to the nine North Atlantic Bond events. We propose that the millennial-scale trend of dust activity was primarily influenced by variations in the mid-latitude Westerlies, while the dust events on the centennial scale were driven primarily by a strengthened East Asian winter monsoon. Overall, this study provides a reliable, high-resolution record of Holocene dust activity in inland Asia, and it updates the previous view that dust activity in this region was solely controlled by the mid-latitude Westerlies or the Siberian High. Our findings contribute to an improved understanding of global dust transport with implications for predicting future dust activity in this region.

DIVERSITY-BASEL												Foraging is the key behavior of waterbirds, which profoundly affects the survival of their population, and it is affected by interspecific interaction. At Shengjin Lake in China, owing to the reduced availability of suitable habitats for a large population of migratory waterbirds (especially wild geese) over winter, mixed species foraging inevitably occurs. This study aimed to investigate whether mixed-species foraging affects the foraging of hooded cranes (Grus monacha). Fields surveys were carried out at Shengjin Lake from November 2018 to March 2019. Mixed-species foraging was surveyed between the flocks of hooded cranes and three species of geese, greater white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons), lesser white-fronted geese (Anser erythropus) and bean geese (Anser fabalis). Instantaneous scanning and focal animal methods were used to collect behavioral samples of hooded cranes. The quadrat method was used to survey the food density in three habitats: meadows, mudflats, and paddy fields. The results showed that the foraging success rate of hooded cranes was not significantly correlated with food density and the relative flock size in the mixed-species foraging flock in meadows, but a significant negative correlation with the relative flock size in mudflats. However in paddy fields it was a significant positive correlation with the relative flock size. Foraging efforts of hooded cranes were negatively correlated with food density and positively correlated with the relative flock size in meadows. In mudflats, foraging efforts of hooded cranes had a significant positively correlation with the relative flock size, however, there was a significant negative correlation with the relative flock size in paddy fields. To sum up, larger numbers of geese mixed with hooded cranes has a favorable effect on the foraging of hooded cranes in meadows and mudflats, however, the reverse was observed in the paddy fields.

Effects of climate variability on transparency and thermal structure in subtropical, monomictic Lake Annie, Florida	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												Lake Annie is a small (37 ha), relatively deep (21 m) sinkhole lake on the Lake Wales Ridge (LWR) of central Florida with a long history of study, including monthly limnological monitoring since June, 1983. The record shows high variability in Secchi disc transparency, which ranged from <1 to 15 in with a trend toward decreasing values over the latter decade of record. We examined available regional meteorological, groundwater and limnological data to determine the drivers and thermal consequences of variability in water transparency. While total nutrient concentrations and chlorophyll-a were highest during years of low transparency, stepwise regression showed that none of these had a significant effect on transparency after water color was taken into account. Repeated years of high precipitation between 1993-2005 caused an increase in water table height, increasing the transport of dissolved substances from the vegetated watershed into the take. Groundwater stage explained 73% of the interannual variability in water transparency. Transparency, in turn, explained 85% of the interannual variability in the heat budget for the lake, which ranged from 1.8 x 10(8) to 4.1 x 10(8) Joules m(-2) yr(-1), encompassing the range reported across Florida lakes. While surface water temperature was not affected by transparency, depths below 5 in warmed faster during the stratified period during years having a lower rate of light extinction. We show that an increase in precipitation of 20 cm per year reduces the depth of the summer euphotic zone and thermocline by 1.9 and 1.6 m, respectively, and causes a I-month reduction in the duration of winter mixing in this monomictic lake. Because biota have been shown to respond to shifts in light and heat distribution of much smaller magnitude than exhibited here, our work suggests that Subtle changes in precipitation linked to climate fluctuations may have significant physical as well as, biotic consequences.

The strongly seasonal Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus, reside in lakes covered by thick ice and snow throughout the dark winter in the north. In the present study, we have measured diel changes in their plasma tnelatonin concentrations from September to June in Lake Storvatnet (70 degrees N), northern Norway. In addition, we have measured the in vitro melatonin production of Arctic chart pineal glands held at experimental light conditions. From September to April a diel profile in plasma tnelatonin was seen in the charr in Lake Storvatn, with highest concentrations at night. This profile reflected the prevailing above-surface photoperiod, even in February when there were minimal changes in sub-surface irradiance between day and night. In June, plasma tnelatonin was low throughout the 24-hr cycle, despite there being a marked sub-surface difference in irradiance between night and day. At this time the irradiance in night probably remained above the threshold for suppression of melatonin production. The in vitro experiments revealed no endogenous rhythm in the pineal melatonin secretion, supporting the conclusion that the diel profile seen in the Arctic charr in their natural habitat was driven by ambient photoperiod. In conclusion, the Arctic charr appear to keep track of time even under the extreme conditions of high latitudes during winter, when lakes have thick ice and snow cover.

J	Bradley, DC; Ormerod, SJ				Bradley, DC; Ormerod, SJ			Community persistence among stream invertebrates tracks the North Atlantic Oscillation	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												1. The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) affects marine ecosystems, lakes and some terrestrial ecosystems around the Atlantic rim, but evidence for effects on rivers is scarce. For 14 years, we sampled riverine macroinvertebrates in eight independent streams from the Llyn Brianne experimental catchments in central Wales. We assessed whether year-to-year persistence in rank abundance and species composition tracked the NAO. 2. Persistence was quasi-cyclical and varied synchronously across all streams, irrespective of chemistry and catchment land use. Invertebrate communities in all stream types or habitats switched significantly from being highly persistent during negative phases of the NAO (winter index <1 = cold, dry winters) to unstable during positive phases (>1 = mild, wet winters). These effects occurred in both rare and common taxa. 3. Acid episodes could not explain low persistence in positive NAO years because variations in acid-base status were not linked to the NAO. Moreover, fluctuations in persistence were apparent even in well-buffered streams. 4. Discharge in adjacent gauged catchments increased in positive NAO years by 15-18% but neither flow variability nor flow maxima were higher. Nor were variations in invertebrate persistence at Llyn Brianne directly correlated with discharge pattern. Discharge variations alone were therefore insufficient to explain links between persistence and the NAO, but we cannot exclude subtle effects due either to flow or temperature. 5. These data illustrate how the persistence of invertebrate communities varies through time in fluctuating environments. Positive phases of the NAO are accompanied by ecological instability in the Llyn Brianne streams, although the exact mechanisms are currently unclear. The effects of the NAO might confound or obscure other long-term change in rivers such as recovery from acidification or the effects of global warming.

J	Isermann, DA				Isermann, Daniel A.			Validation of Nonlethal Sex Determination for Black Crappies during Spring	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												I evaluated the accuracy of using differences in body coloration, gamete stripping, and abdominal distension in females as a nonlethal method for determining the sex of black crappies Pomoxis nigromaculatus collected from two Minnesota lakes during spring (late April-early June). Sex assignments based on these three attributes were 93% accurate for all black crappies (211 of 227) and 98% accurate (174 of 177) for black crappies of 200 mm or more total length. The difference in body coloration between sexes was the most useful trait for identifying sex, but the distended abdomen of females and gamete stripping aided in identifying sex in some instances. Nonlethal sex assignment was less reliable for black crappies less than 200 mm (74% accurate; 37 of 50), largely because of the lack of dark coloration in males. The sex of black crappies of 200 mm or more can be identified accurately without killing the fish, but that of smaller crappies should be determined by means of visual inspection of the gonads.																			0275-5947					APR	2010	30	2					352	353		10.1577/M09-100.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M09-100.1													WOS:000277947800003

They alternate as the dominant species (more than 80% of total zooplankton biomass), with the former being dominant in winter and the latter in summer. Shifts between these taxa are sudden, and intermediate situations usually do not last more than 1 month. Although seasonal shifts between zooplankton dominant species appear to be related with temperature, other factors such as trophic state or oxygen concentration may also play an important role. Shifts between species dominances may be driven by thresholds in these environmental variables. However, according to the alternative stable states theory, under conditions of stable dominance a certain resistance to change may exist, causing that gradual changes might have little effect until a tipping point is reached, at which the reverse change becomes much more difficult. We investigated which are the possible factors causing seasonal zooplankton shifts. We used high-frequency temperature and oxygen data provided by sensors installed in situ to analyse if shifts in zooplankton composition are determined by a threshold in these variables or, on the other hand, some gradual change between stable states occur. Moreover, following the postulates of the alternative stable states theory, we looked at possible hysteresis to analyse if these seasonal zooplankton shifts behave as critical transitions between two different equilibriums. We also examined if top-down or bottom-up trophic interactions affect these zooplankton shifts. Our results show that shifts between dominant zooplankton species in La Pletera salt marshes are asymmetric. The shift to a Eurytemora situation is mainly driven by a decrease in temperature, with a threshold close to 19 degrees C of daily average temperature, while the shift to Brachionus does not. Usually, the decrease in water temperature is accompanied by a decrease in oxygen oscillation with values always close to 100% oxygen saturation. Moreover, oxygen and temperature values before the shift to calanoids are different from those before the reverse shift to Brachionus, suggesting hysteresis and some resistance to change when a critical transition is approaching. Top-down and bottom-up forces appear to have no significant effect on shifts, since zooplankton biomass was not negatively correlated with fish biomass and was not positively related with chlorophyll, in overall data or within shifts.					; Quintana, Xavier/L-5083-2014; Compte, Jordi/L-9231-2014; Menció, Anna/K-2745-2014; Anton-Pardo, Maria/G-5156-2015; Gascon, Stephanie/L-7471-2014; Obrador, Biel/A-1856-2009; Mencio, Anna/K-2745-2014; Boix, Dani/L-5190-2014; Sala, Jordi/L-8234-2014; Gascón, Stéphanie/L-7471-2014	Tornero Pinilla, Irene/0000-0001-7337-4263; Quintana, Xavier/0000-0002-4070-1915; Compte, Jordi/0000-0002-2715-5518; casamitjana, xavier/0000-0003-1662-9076; Anton-Pardo, Maria/0000-0003-1722-9867; Gascon, Stephanie/0000-0003-1951-9083; Mencio, Anna/0000-0001-6023-5862; Boix, Dani/0000-0001-5468-2236; 													1015-1621	1420-9055				OCT	2021	83	4							69	10.1007/s00027-021-00824-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-021-00824-5													WOS:000693586300001

Identifying Relationships between Catches of Spawning Condition Yellow Perch and Environmental Variables in the Western Basin of Lake Erie	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Although the reproductive behavior of yellow perch Perca flavescens has been well documented in small systems, relatively little is known about the spawning preferences of yellow perch in large systems, such as the Laurentian Great Lakes. During 2006 and 2007, we compared the presence and abundance adult yellow perch during the spring spawning season with environmental variables in the western basin of Lake Erie. We also estimated the timing of yellow perch spawning by comparing the relative abundance of gravid and spent females collected in our trawls and then comparing the proportion of gravid females with environmental conditions at our sampling sites. Overall, the probability of catching adult yellow perch and the catch per unit effort increased with increasing bottom temperatures in the spring, whereas the probability of catching gravid females increased with increasing Secchi depth. However, the relationships between our catch metrics and environmental variables were not consistent across years, possibly as a result of the very strong 2003 year-class, which became first-year spawners in 2006. We also documented that yellow perch spawning occurred when bottom temperatures were between 11 degrees C and 15 degrees C in the western basin; these temperatures were reached on different dates in different parts of the basin and in different years. Thus, we suggest that management agencies consider basing the start of the commercial fishing season on prevailing bottom temperatures rather than using a set date across years and sites.					; Marschall, Elizabeth/A-1608-2014	Collingsworth, Paris/0000-0003-3294-3065; Marschall, Elizabeth/0000-0002-8026-4203													0002-8487	1548-8659				JAN	2011	140	1					31	36	PII 933540191	10.1080/00028487.2011.545018	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2011.545018													WOS:000288280100004
J	Helfer, F; Lemckert, C; Zhang, H				Helfer, Fernanda; Lemckert, Charles; Zhang, Hong			Impacts of climate change on temperature and evaporation from a large reservoir in Australia	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Determining evaporation rates is essential for efficient management of reservoirs and water resources, particularly in water-scarce countries such as Australia. Today, it is estimated that open water reservoirs in Australia lose around 40% of their total water storage capacity per year to evaporation. While this loss is of significant concern, the threat of a changing climate has been directing greater focus to how much water will be lost from Australia's reservoirs in the future. This paper analyses evaporation rates from a large water supply reservoir in South-East Queensland (SEQ), Australia, under current climate and predicted climate change conditions using modelling. Daily meteorological projections from nine global climate models were used in the model DYRESM as the driving forces of the thermodynamics of the reservoir under study. Two future 20-year period simulations were undertaken, one from 2030 to 2050, and the other from 2070 to 2090. The modelled future evaporation rates, as well as water temperatures, were then compared with modelled evaporation rates and temperatures obtained using observed meteorological variables for the period of 1990-2010. The results showed that the evaporation rates from the study reservoir will increase in the future. For the period centred in 2040, the annual evaporation will be approximately 8% higher than the 20-year average annual evaporation estimated for the present climate. A more pronounced increase in evaporation is expected in 2070-2090, with annual evaporation predictions being approximately 15% higher than the baseline evaporation. The main agent behind this increase is higher surface air temperatures in the future. According to the modelling results, the mean annual surface air temperature will grow from the present value of 20.4 degrees C to 21.5 degrees C in 2030-2050, and to 23.2 degrees C in 2070-2090. As a consequence, the mean annual surface water temperatures of the reservoir will increase by 0.9 degrees C and 1.7 degrees C in both timeframes, respectively. This will have a significant impact on the evaporation rates, particularly in spring and summer, when the temperature increases will be more significant. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

(NORTHERN APENNINES, ITALY)	RIVISTA ITALIANA DI PALEONTOLOGIA E STRATIGRAFIA												During the sampling of a stratigraphic section along the shore of the Fiastra Lake (Carg ProjectSheet 313 "Camerino" of the Geological Map of Italy at 1:50 000 scale), a small rock boulder with partially exposed bony material was discovered at the base of a small cliff at the northern termination of the Sibillini Mts. In this area, the classical facies of Umbria -Marche stratigraphic succession are well -exposed. The Oligocene -Miocene portion of the succession is represented by the -200 m -thick Scaglia Cinerea Formation, passing upwards to the -100 m -thick Bisciaro Formation. The microfossil assemblage has allowed the specimen to be constrained to the lower Burdigalian. The skeletal remains were examined using a CT -SCAN, a non-invasive method that has proven to be highly perform - ing. The analysis revealed some articulated vertebrae, deformed by lithostatic compaction, which are attributed to a shark of the order Lamniformes. Subsequently, the vertebrae were digitally isolated, extracted from the surrounding matrix, and rendered into three-dimensional prints. Through digital retro -deformation, the body length of the lamni - form shark was estimated to be approximately 4 metres. Further considerations on the vertebrae allowed us to infer that the studied shark had similarities to either Isurus oxyrinchus Rafinesque, 1810 or Carcharodon carcharias Linnaeus, 1758 . The development of a dead -fall microbial community likely facilitated the preservation of the vertebrae. The studied specimen represents the first occurrence of a lamniform shark in the Lower Miocene of the Umbria -Marche Domain and represents one of the very rare recorded occurrences of lamniforms from the Lower Miocene of Italy.

J	URBAN, TP; BRANDT, SB				URBAN, TP; BRANDT, SB			FOOD AND HABITAT PARTITIONING BETWEEN YOUNG-OF-YEAR ALEWIVES AND RAINBOW SMELT IN SOUTHEASTERN LAKE-ONTARIO	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Thermal and depth distributions, diets and time of feeding of young-of-year (YOY) alewives and YOY rainbow smelt were compared for evidence of resource partitioning in southeastern Lake Ontario. YOY alewives were largely epilimnial during August and September, but moved toward the bottom during fall turnover. Alewives were most abundant in the warmest available water. YOY rainbow smelt were concentrated at depths between 10 and 30 m in August and September, but moved into deeper water at fall turnover. Depth distribution of YOY smelt was correlated with temperatures of 8-12-degrees-C. Both species fed predominantly during day on zooplankton during August and September. Cyclopoid copepods were the most common prey, but bosminids, eubosminids, and occasionally calanoid copepods were frequently eaten. As YOY rainbow smelt grew (> 60 mm), they consumed more Mysis relicta and amphipods, which became the major prey of rainbow smelt by November. YOY alewives consumed mostly zooplankton in all months. Diet overlap of the two species was greatest in warm water (> 12.0-degrees-C) during October (94.3% similarity) and August (80.0% similarity) and lowest in November (16.9% similarity). Positive size-selection on zooplankton was found in all months for.YOY rainbow smelt, but only in late September through November for YOY alewives. Thus, during thermal stratification, the species were spatially segregated by water temperature but had a high degree of overlap in time of feeding and types of prey eaten. In contrast, after fall turnover there was a greater separation in diet but a higher overlap in habitat use.																			0378-1909					APR	1993	36	4					359	372		10.1007/BF00012414	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00012414													WOS:A1993KW94300006

However, contamination risks of HMs in overlying water of small wetlands, which are easily ignored because of their minor occupancy in an overall area, are nearly unknown. A total of 36 water samples containing six HMs were collected from the urban and rural small wetlands of Urumqi in China, and the contamination levels and probabilistic health risks caused by HMs were assessed using the Nemerow pollution index (NPI) and the health risk assessment model introduced by the US EPA. The results revealed that the average concentration of Hg in the urban and rural small wetlands surpassed the Class II thresholds of the Environmental Quality Standards for Surface Water (GB 3838-2002) by factors of 3.2 and 5.0 times, respectively. The overall contamination levels of HMs in the small wetlands fall into the high contamination level. Results of a health risk assessment indicated that non-carcinogenic health risk of the investigated HMs are found to be lower than the acceptable range for adults, but higher than the acceptable range for children. Meanwhile, As falls into the low carcinogenic risk level, whereas Cd falls into the very low carcinogenic risk level. Overall, HMs in rural small wetlands showed relatively higher contamination levels and probabilistic health risks than that of urban small wetlands. In addition, As was identified as the dominant health risk factor in the overlying water of small wetlands in the study area. Findings of this study provide scientific support needed for the prevention of HM contamination of small wetlands in arid zones.					; Hu, yonglong/KWU-3191-2024	Wang, Liling Wang/0009-0001-2598-9105; 														2305-6304				JUL	2024	12	7							488	10.3390/toxics12070488	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/toxics12070488								39058140					WOS:001277444900001

Transect lines and point counts were combined to estimate the population size of the scaly-sided Merganser during the period November 2010 to March 2011. Along all eight surveyed river sections in four rivers, the riparian environment was mountain forest or close to mountain forest on one or both sides of the rivers. The scaly-sided Merganser was often found in the rivers with scattered shoals. The largest number of scaly-sided Mergansers seen during each of the five months varied from 61 to 91. Groups of Chinese Merganser were classified as male, female, mixed sex, solitary female and solitary male. Mixed sex groups were the most frequently encountered (64 sightings) and comprised 71.91% of all groups sighted (89 groups). Solitary mergansers accounted for 22.47% (male, 15.73%; female, 6.74%) of all sightings and were also frequently encountered. Solitary Merganser and groups with 2-9 individuals account for 22.47% and 64.04% of total group number (n=89). Feeding, swimming, resting and maintenance were the most frequent behavior patterns. For the first time, mergansers were observed copulating in winter in the Wuyuan River section. The sex ratio was 1:0.74 (Females + sub-adults: males, n=432). Threats to the conservation of the scaly-sided Mergansers included sand mining, fishing, riparian vegetation destruction and water pollution. Taiyangsheng, Taopi, Qinghu and Wuyuan sections should be prioritized for protection because these areas have relatively large and stable population. We recommend specific conservation strategies designed to protect this endangered species.																			0030-9923					MAR-APR	2012	44	2					503	510																WOS:000302000600029

However, with the exception of speleothem records, abrupt changes of the ISM during the last glacial are not well documented in terrestrial records. Here we present a sediment record from Xingyun Lake in Yunnan Province, southwest China, spanning the interval 36.4 ka BP to 13.4 ka BP (1 ka = 1000 cal a) which documents the occurrence of a series of millennial-scale episodes which may reflect the abrupt weakening of the ISM. Seven AMS C-14 dates from terrestrial wood fragments provide a robust chronology. The results demonstrate that increases in the coarse sediment fraction (>30 mu m) correspond to increases in the concentration of Pediastrum, the grain size of magnetic minerals, carbonate content and C/N ratios, which together indicate episodes of low lake level. In addition, pollen analysis indicates that Quercus (oak) increased and that ferns decreased during intervals of abrupt weakening of the ISM, indicating a drier environment. Nine abrupt shifts to a low lake level are documented for the studied interval and three of them are correlative with Heinrich events 1 to 3. Our study supports the hypothesis that, in response to the cold events in the North Atlantic associated with massive iceberg influxes and the corresponding slowing down of Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, the mean latitudinal extent of the ITCZ shifted southwards. As a result of an atmospheric teleconnection there was a corresponding decrease in precipitation associated with ISM precipitation, which caused reduced fluvial runoff in Yunnan.

Stable isotopes of 18O and D in key components of water flows and the permafrost zone of Central Yakutia (Eastern Siberia)	LED I SNEG-ICE AND SNOW												On the basis of about 430 analyses, the O-18 and D compositions (parts per thousand) of atmospheric precipitation, ground ice, surface and inter-permafrost underground waters of cryogenic-aeolian landscapes of Central Yakutia (Eastern Siberia) are discussed. Precipitation compositions here demonstrate a large annual variation (from -6.12 to -45.0 parts per thousand for delta O-18, and from -72.1 to -350.1 parts per thousand for delta D), and they are described by the Local Meteoric Water Line according to the equation delta D = 7.81 delta O-18 - 1.57). In winter and in the process of spring melting, the snow storage is subjected to a significant evaporative fractionation, that is expressed by the equation delta D = 6.85 delta O-18 - 31.9. The heaviest and deuterium-depleted compositions (delta O-18 = -19.3 parts per thousand, delta D = 160.9, d(exc) = -6.7 parts per thousand) are found in the last snow patches in early June. The lightest compositions similar to the present-day winter precipitation (snow) are characteristic of the polygonal wedge ices (PWI) of the Central Yakutia. The most lightweight (from -30 to -34 parts per thousand for delta O-18, and from 240 to 275% for delta D) were established to be typical for the ancient PWI, dated by the first half of the Late Pleistocene (MIS 3-4). Heavier compositions (delta O-18 = -27.2 +/- 1.4, delta D = -215.8 +/- 8.5, d(exc) = 1.7 +/- 3.1 parts per thousand) with obvious features of evaporative fractionation correspond to younger PWI (MIS 2-1). The heaviest compositions (delta O-18 = -12.2 +/- 0.7, delta D = -99.2 +/- 4.7, d(exc) = -2.0 +/- 0.8 parts per thousand) and high angular coefficients of approximating equations were determined in the investigated cave ices of sublimation origin, that implies the atmospheric origin of them. The current processes of evaporative fractionation are the most intensively reflected in the waters of aeolian lakes (delta O-18 = -11.8 +/- 3.5, delta D = -120.2 +/- 18.4, d(exc) = -25.8 +/- 10.5 parts per thousand), and the compositions are described by the regression equation delta D = 5.52 delta O-18 - 54.12 (R-2 = 0.97). The phenomenal objects of the cryogenic-eolian landscapes of the Central Yakutia are high-debit underground sources. Among all other components of the water flows, composition of these sources is the most stable (delta O-18 = -21.6 +/- 0.8, delta D = -172.6 +/- 5.1, d(exc) = 0.23 +/- 3.0 parts per thousand). The regression of compositions of the largest underground source Bulus is approximated by the equation delta D = 6.31 delta O-18 - 36.7 (R-2 = 0.78), that is indicative to significant evaporative fractionation and close relation with the aeolian lakes in the alimentation area.

Palaeoclimate Change in the Southern Black Sea Region and Its Impact on the Fate of Rome-From Megadrought to Collapse of Rome's &gt;Polis Command Economy&lt;	HERITAGE												In recent scholarship, the impact of palaeoclimate change is often understood as a main factor contributing to the fragmentation and "fall" of Rome's empire. The various attempts at postulating disastrous effects of temperature shifts in the fifth to sixth centuries-cooling caused harvest failures, famine, political and social unrest, and disruptions in food supply-have been criticized for a good reason: compelling causal links between cooler weather conditions and decreasing agricultural productivity are missing. The socio-economic and political impact of a prolonged climate-related Late Roman drought (ca. 360-440 CE), however, has been widely overlooked. This paper aims to compare palaeoecological data from cave speleothems and lake sediments that indicate palaeoclimate and environmental change through precipitation shifts in the southern Black Sea region with the archaeological data of the urban granary in Pompeiopolis. Combining these data offers fresh insights into Roman environmental imperialism, command ecologies and economies, and the impact of climate change on Rome's tax system that kept the network of redistributive food supply running. This archaeo-environmental approach sheds light on the ecological vulnerability of integrated economies, failures of the dysfunctional metabolic regimes of > polis command economies <, and the chain of cause-and-effect provoking the "fall" of Rome.																			2571-9408					MAY 3	2025	8	5							160	10.3390/heritage8050160	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/heritage8050160													WOS:001496812000001
J	Sener, S; Sener, E; Davraz, A				Sener, Sehnaz; Sener, Erhan; Davraz, Aysen			Assessment of groundwater quality and health risk in drinking water basin using GIS	JOURNAL OF WATER AND HEALTH												Egirdir Lake basin was selected as the study area because the lake is the second largest freshwater lake in Turkey and groundwater in the basin is used as drinking water. In the present study, 29 groundwater samples were collected and analyzed for physico-chemical parameters to determine the hydrochemical characteristics, groundwater quality, and human health risk in the study area. The dominant ions are Ca2+, Mg2+, HCO32-, and SO42. According to Gibbs plot, the predominant samples fall in the rock-water interaction field. A groundwater quality index (WQI) reveals that the majority of the samples falls under good to excellent category of water, suggesting that the groundwater is suitable for drinking and other domestic uses. The Ca-Mg-HCO3, Ca-HCO3, Ca-SO4-HCO3, and Ca-Mg-HCO3-SO4 water types are the dominant water types depending on the water-rock interaction in the investigation area. Risk of metals to human health was then evaluated using hazard quotients (HQ) by ingestion and dermal pathways for adults and children. It was indicated that As with HQ ingestion > 1 was the most important pollutant leading to non-carcinogenic concerns. It can be concluded that the highest contributors to chronic risks were As and Cr for both adults and children.

Physical background of the development of oxygen depletion in ice-covered lakes	OECOLOGIA												The effect of the heat interaction between a water column and sediments on the formation, development, and duration of existence of anaerobic zones in ice-covered lakes is estimated based on observational data from five frozen lakes located in northwestern Russia and North America. A simple one-dimensional model that describes the formation and development of the dissolved oxygen deficit in shallow ice-covered lakes is suggested. The model reproduces the main features of dissolved oxygen dynamics during the ice-covered period; that is, the vertical structure, the thickness, and the rate of increase of the anaerobic zone in bottom layers. The model was verified against observational data. The results from the verification show that the model adequately describes the dissolved oxygen dynamics in winter. The consumption rates of DO by bacterial plankton and by bottom sediments, which depend on the heat transfer through the water-sediment interface, are calculated. The results obtained allow the appearance of potentially dangerous anaerobic zones in shallow lakes and in separate lake areas, which result from thermal regime changes, to be predicted.					; Zdorovennova, Galina/L-8214-2013; Terzhevik, Arkady/L-7911-2013; Kirillin, Georgiy/B-5410-2010	Ali Maher, Osama/0000-0002-0594-951X; Zdorovennova, Galina/0000-0003-2726-0104; Terzhevik, Arkady/0000-0002-0837-9065; Kirillin, Georgiy/0000-0001-7337-3586													0029-8549	1432-1939				MAR	2007	151	2					331	340		10.1007/s00442-006-0543-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-006-0543-8								17115190					WOS:000244302500015
J	Salonen, K; Rosenberg, M				Salonen, K; Rosenberg, M			Advantages from diel vertical migration can explain the dominance of Gonyostomum semen (Raphidophyceae) in a small, steeply-stratified humic lake	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												In late summer, a large flagellated alga, Gonyostomum semen (Raphidophyceae), constituted most of the phytoplankton biomass in a small steeply-stratified humic lake. Its diel vertical migration (DVM) was very distinct and extended at night into the anoxic hypolimnion. After midsummer, the depletion of hypolimnetic oxygen led to a gradual release of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) from the sediment, but one month later, irrespective of continuing stratification, the concentrations again returned to undetectable levels down to the bottom. As this coincided with the rapid increase in G.semen population, the latter was probably responsible for the depletion of SRP The flux of SRP from the sediment to the epilimnion was virtually interrupted, making non-migrating phytoplankton dependent only on regenerated and inflowing inorganic phosphorus. Besides nutrient availability, DVM also benefited G.semen in the reduction of metabolic and grazing losses. In this lake, the remarkable multiple advantages of DVM probably explain the dominance of the large G.semen in the late summer phytoplankton biomass over much smaller algae.																			0142-7873					OCT	2000	22	10					1841	1853		10.1093/plankt/22.10.1841	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/22.10.1841													WOS:000089827800003
J	Mucha, JM; Mackereth, RW				Mucha, Jamie M.; Mackereth, Robert W.			Habitat use and movement patterns of brook trout in Nipigon Bay, Lake Superior	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis are one of two salmonine species native to Lake Superior. Abundant and widely distributed a century ago, Lake Superior's brook trout (coasters) have been reduced to a few remnant stocks, probably as a result of exploitation and habitat loss. Twenty brook trout captured in Nipigon Bay, Lake Superior, were surgically implanted with radio transmitters and were located from June 1999 to October 2000. Brook trout locations were used to determine the characteristics of utilized lake habitat and to identify streams used for spawning and the spawning areas within them. These locations were also used to establish daily and seasonal movement patterns. A total of 638 locations were obtained during the tracking period, 483 occurring within Nipigon Bay and the remaining 155 within tributaries. Brook trout were located almost exclusively within the shallow nearshore areas of Nipigon Bay; 92% of the locations were less than 7 to deep and 94% were less than 400 m from shore. Brook trout occupied deeper areas with steeper shoreline slopes during July and August, when the water temperatures of shallow nearshore areas were at their highest. Following selected individuals for 24-h periods revealed that brook trout often used deeper areas during daylight hours and moved to extremely shallow nearshore areas during the night. Radio-tagged brook trout began ascending tributaries during late summer in both years of this study. The mean residency time for brook trout in tributaries was 46 d. Spawning occurred in early October, and most radio-tagged brook trout returned to Lake Superior by mid-October. Four different streams were used during the spawning period. Brook trout entering streams exhibited strong spawning site fidelity between years.

In 1991, avian predators such as Snowy Owls Nyctea scandiaca, gulls and skuas bred well; Arctic foxes Alopex lagopus were rarely observed in the study area but bred in the immediate vicinity. In both years there was a late thaw, but this did not deter breeding by birds. The insect food supply for waders showed similar patterns of abundance in both years. In 1991, 73 nests of nine species of wader were found within a 14-km2 study area, and Dark-bellied Brent Geese Branta bernicla bernicla nested in association with Snowy Owls. The overall density of wader nests was estimated to be 7 per km2. Clutches disappeared at only two wader nests and no Brent Goose nests, and the Mayfield estimate of the daily probability of predation for waders was 0.0022. In contrast, the daily probability of predation was 0.20 in 1992, when there was a similar breeding density of waders. Arctic foxes were seen searching for food daily within the study area, and fox droppings were found associated with nests taken by predators. The predicted scenarios for peak and decreasing lemming years (the Roselaar-Summers hypothesis), i.e. low predation and high nest success in the peak year and high predation and low nest success in the decreasing year, therefore occurred.					; Syroechkovskiy, Evgeny/AAO-5258-2020	Schekkerman, Hans/0000-0003-3127-4832; Underhill, Les/0000-0002-8758-1527; 													0019-1019	1474-919X				JUL	1993	135	3					277	292		10.1111/j.1474-919X.1993.tb02845.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1474-919X.1993.tb02845.x													WOS:A1993LM87000008

In this paper, we report a pollen record from Yilong Lake in Yunnan Province, southwestern China, to understand vegetation response to long-term climatic variation and human activities at a regional-level over the last 27,000 years. Findings show that temperate and coniferous taxa were dominant before 18 cal kyr BP reflecting the glacial climate. Between 18 and 14 cal kyr BP, thermophilic taxa increased in response to global deglaciation. A notable shift from deciduous to evergreen forests occurred at approximately 14 cal kyr BP, after which pollen concen-tration increased but pollen diversity decreased. Pollen assemblages indicated dense forests, primarily composed of evergreen oaks developed under warm and strong summer monsoon conditions from 13 to 8 cal kyr BP. High rates of vegetation change occurred during the middle Holocene before vegetation diversity gradually increased during the Holocene Thermal Optimum, with high variability of precipitation in the Yilong Lake region. Anthropogenic forcing progressively became the main factor affecting vegetation composition and vegetation change rates over the past three millennia.					凯, 李/KWU-0203-2024; Ni, Jian/I-7067-2012	Li, Kai/0000-0002-6197-4082; 													0031-0182	1872-616X				FEB 15	2024	636								111990	10.1016/j.palaeo.2023.111990	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2023.111990		DEC 2023											WOS:001147848500001

B.; Brauer, Achim			On the origin and processes controlling the elemental and isotopic composition of carbonates in hypersaline Andean lakes	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												The Altiplano-Puna Plateau of the Central Andes hosts numerous lakes, playa-lakes, and salars with a great diversity and abundance of carbonates forming under extreme climatic, hydrologic, and environmental conditions. To unravel the underlying processes controlling the formation of carbonates and their geochemical signatures in hypersaline systems, we investigated coupled brine-carbonate samples in a high-altitude Andean lake using a wide suite of petrographic (SEM, XRD) and geochemical tools (delta 2H, delta 18O, delta 13C, delta 11B, major and minor ion composition, aqueous modelling). Our findings show that the inflow of hydrothermal springs in combination with strong CO2 degassing and evaporation plays an important role in creating a spatial diversity of hydro chemical sub-environments allowing different types of microbialites (microbial mounds and mats), travertines, and fine-grained calcite minerals to form. Carbonate precipitation occurs in hot springs triggered by a shift in carbonate equilibrium by hydrothermal CO2 degassing and microbially-driven elevation of local pH at crystallisation. In lakes, carbonate precipitation is induced by evaporative supersaturation, with contributions from CO2 degassing and microbiological processes. Lake carbonates largely record the evaporitic enrichment (hence salinity) of the parent water which can be traced by Na, Li, B, and delta 18O, although other factors (such as e.g., high precipitation rates, mixing with thermal waters, groundwater, or precipitation) also affect their signatures. This study is of significance to those dealing with the fractionation of oxygen, carbon, and boron isotopes and partitioning of elements in natural brine-carbonate environments. Furthermore, these findings contribute to the advancement in proxy development for these depositional environments.

The Boreal Landbird Component of Migrant Bird Communities in Eastern North America	BOREAL BIRDS OF NORTH AMERICA: A HEMISPHERIC VIEW OF THEIR CONSERVATION LINKS AND SIGNIFICANCE	Studies in Avian Biology											The vast and remote boreal forest supports nearly 50% of North America's bird species, some of which appear to be in decline and the majority of which are not well monitored. In this study, we provide evidence based on a geographic information system (GIS) analysis of >300,000 banding records that (particularly in fall) the migrations of birds that breed in the boreal forest region from Alaska to the Canadian Maritimes are not simple north-south movements. Rather, they take the form of a large-scale funneling southeast across the Great Lakes and/or southwest along the Appalachians. Boreal birds of some 50 species make up 50% or more of the migrants caught at banding stations located within and near an area of the mid-Appalachian mountains that is about 350 km across. For example, at the Powdermill Avian Research Center in the mountains of southwestern Pennsylvania, 32 species of boreal songbirds comprised 50% of fall captures over a 15-year period. At Allegheny Front Migration Observatory, in the mountains of northeastern West Virginia, 35 species of boreal songbirds comprised 62% of captures over the same period. We propose that the apparent funneling of migrants from across an expansive boreal breeding area through a comparatively narrow "neck" creates an exceptional opportunity for data from coordinated fall migration banding to be used in the monitoring of many species for which other methods are inadequate. Furthermore, it suggests that states within the mid-Appalachian region have a high responsibility for the conservation of boreal landbird migrants.																					978-0-520-95058-0				2011		41					73	83																WOS:000296090000007

The waters examined were all acidic with pH ranging from 1.21 to 4.21. All fourteen naturally occurring Ln's were determined for six waters and at least seven Ln's were determined for the other waters. The Ln contents were as a whole at the ppb levels. The Ln patterns obtained by normalization with the Ln contents in Leedey chondrites differed from water to water but were classifiable into two groups; one with a relative enrichment of the light Ln's and thus showing negative slopes and the other having no or little slope (horizontal patterns). The horizontal patterns were found for the Kusatsu-yubatake and Bandaiko hot spring waters and the Yugama water. The Ln patterns of the waters in the Kusatsu area are explained by considering that the light Ln's are leached from rock by flowing acidic waters faster than the heavy Ln's, that in the Ln distribution between acidic water with high Ln contents and rock the heavy Ln's are relatively more preferentially distributed into the solution phase than the light Ln's are, and in addition that andesitic rocks in the Kusatsu area altered by flowing acidic waters have flatter Ln patterns than those of unaltered ones. It was also found that the fluctuation of the Ln pattern from the expected smooth line was in general larger for the heavy Ln's than for the light Ln's, which could be a manifestation of the tetrad effect.																			0016-7002	1880-5973					1993	27	1					19	33		10.2343/geochemj.27.19	http://dx.doi.org/10.2343/geochemj.27.19													WOS:A1993LX22400003

J	Panou, M; Gkelis, S				Panou, Manthos; Gkelis, Spyros			Unravelling unknown cyanobacteria diversity linked with HCN production	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION												Cyanobacteria are ecologically versatile microorganisms, occupying diverse habitats, from terrestrial caves to coastal shores and from brackish lakes to thermal springs. Cyanobacteria have also been linked with hydrogen cyanide (HCN), mainly for their ability to catabolize HCN by the nitrogenase enzyme. In this context, we sampled disparate environments, spanning from Canary Islands and Iceland to Estonia and Cyprus. Eighty-one (81) strains were isolated and characterised with taxonomic indices and molecular markers (16S-23S rRNA region and cpcBA region), whilst their ability to produce HCN was evaluated. This approach resulted in the description of five new genera (Speleotes, Haliplanktos, Olisthonema, Speos, and Iphianassa) and their type species (S. anchialus, H. antonyquinny, O. eestii, S. fyssassi, I. zackieohae) representing Chroococcales, Chroococcidiopsales, Oscillatoriales, Synechococcales, and Nostocales orders, respectively. We also found unique lineages inside the genera Komarekiella, Stenomitos, Cyanocohniella, and Nodularia, describing four new species (K. chia, S. pantisii, C. hyphalmyra, N. mediterannea). We report for the first time a widespread production of HCN amongst different taxa and habitats. Epilithic lifestyle, where cyanobacteria are more vulnerable to grazers, had the largest relative frequency in HCN production. In this work, we show novel cyanobacteria diversity from various habitats, including an unexplored anchialine cave, and possible correlation of cyanobacteria chemo- with species diversity, which may have implications on strategic focusing of screening programs on underexploited taxa and/or habitats.

During the rainy season, the lake cools, phytoplankton declines and dominance shifts to algae other than desmids. The lake cools further as harmattan advances, while phytoplankton reaches its minimum, suggesting water temperature to be more important than other environmental conditions. Decrease in phytoplankton density with falling water temperature was probably due to slower reproduction, rather than to increased death rate.																			0018-8158					OCT 23	1992	246	2					169	172		10.1007/BF00014704	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00014704													WOS:A1992KB68600009

J	Lepistö, A; Kortelainen, P; Mattsson, T				Lepisto, Ahti; Kortelainen, Pirkko; Mattsson, Tuija			Increased organic C and N leaching in a northern boreal river basin in Finland	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												Increasing trends in dissolved organic carbon concentrations in small lakes and streams have been reported across Europe and North America. Several hypotheses have been proposed, of which decreasing mineral acidity has recently been considered to be the most likely cause. The near-natural, northern Simojoki river basin (3160 km(2)) is located in the northern boreal zone in Finnish Lapland. Human impacts are minor with only limited forest management, low atmospheric deposition, and declining sulfate and H(+) deposition over recent decades. Here we show that multiple effects (changes both in hydrological dynamics and in climate) explain increasing long-term total organic carbon (TOC) and total organic nitrogen (TON) fluxes in the river. Strong fluctuation was observed in the TOC concentration time series during the studied 43 year time period from 1962 to 2005. Statistically significant upward trends were detected for TON concentration and flow of the river during 1976-2005. The average TOC and TON flux increased by 38% and 42%, respectively, during the 1990s compared with the 1980s. The annual runoff was 27% higher during the 1990s than during the 1980s, accounting for only part of the increase in the TOC and TON outputs. Hydrological fluctuations, including longer drought/wet periods, are important. For example the drought period of 1994-1997 with low concentrations was followed by high TOC and TON concentration peaks and strong leaching fluxes during the period 1998-2000. Average soil temperatures in winter (January-April) in the 1990s were 1.6-2.1 degrees C higher than in the 1980s. This increase may have contributed to increasing trends in organic N concentrations particularly during winter low flow, because of increased organic matter decomposition rates during the dormant season. These changes in decomposition rates might further intensify in warmer climatic conditions.					; Kortelainen, Pirkko/AAN-7045-2020; Mattsson, Tuija/ABA-1524-2020	Mattsson, Tuija/0000-0002-5629-8374; Lepisto, Ahti/0000-0003-4021-2342; Kortelainen, Pirkko/0000-0002-1448-0688													0886-6236					SEP 11	2008	22	3							GB3029	10.1029/2007GB003175	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2007GB003175													WOS:000259200000001

Field observations show that abrupt cooling and warming events (magnitude greater than 5 degrees C d-1) lasting 3-6 days in a large, salmon-bearing river (Quesnel River) are due to upwelling in its upstream lake (Quesnel Lake) during the summer, stratified season. Within the lake, vertical displacement of isotherms in the vicinity of the river mouth associated with this upwelling is shown to be forced by wind events longer than one quarter of the fundamental seiche period and of sufficient magnitude that the Wedderburn number approaches one. Upwelling occurs nearly-simultaneously throughout a smaller basin adjacent to the outflow (West Basin) that is separated from the Main Basin of Quesnel Lake by a sill and contraction. Wind-driven water fluxes across the sill are estimated using a conceptual model based on volume and heat budgets. These estimates provide an upper bound for flow across the sill and suggest that exchange flow may at times be internally hydraulically controlled, with epilinmetic velocities of up to similar to 25 cm/s. Computed fluxes suggest the West Basin hypolimnion has a residence time of 6-8 weeks during the summer stratified period with each upwelling episode irreversibly exchanging 25-30% of the hypolinmetic volume with the rest of the lake. Implications of such events are profound for salmon bearing rivers wherein the thermal habitat is critical to migration success.

Macroinfauna Dynamics and Sediment Parameters of a Subtropical Estuarine Lake-Coombabah Lake (Southern Moreton Bay, Australia)	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												The distribution, composition, density, and biomass of benthic macrofauna within estuarine environments typically exhibit significant variations attributable to heterogeneity in and interactions between physical, biological, and chemical processes. The spatial and temporal dynamics of benthic macroinfauna assemblages and physicochemical sediment parameters within the intertidal mudflats of a subtropical estuarine lake (Coombabah Lake, Southern Moreton Bay) were studied at four sites from August 2006 to April 2007. No significant seasonal changes were observed at any site for all physical sediment parameters. The northern sample sites were characterised by fine- to medium-grained to moderately to poorly sorted sediments and the southern sample sites by fine-grained to moderately well to well-sorted. A total of 1029 individuals representing species from three orders, including deposit feeding and filter feeding macroinfaunal groups, were collected. The highest combined species densities occurred in the fine-grained southern sites, with the greatest combined species density occurring at Site 4 during winter. Amphipods (Victoriopisa australiensis) and polychaete worms (Simplisetia aequisetis) dominated the lake-wide faunal community with V. australiensis, representing 49% of the total retrieved macroinfauna. Significant correlations between mean macroinfauna densities, biomass(DW), sediment parameters, and seasonal maximum monthly temperatures were identified during the study. Seasonal trends in combined site densities were observed at each of the lake sites, with the highest combined density occurring during winter. Spatial and temporal variations might also be partially explained by the predation pressures of fish and migratory wading birds within the lake, with the seasonal presence of migratory wading birds coinciding with the minimum observed macroinfauna densities at each sample site.					; Lemckert, Charles/D-2581-2011; Teasdale, Peter/K-7077-2012; Welsh, David/A-1227-2009; Teasdale, Peter/AAC-1419-2020	Lemckert, Charles/0000-0002-1811-858X; Welsh, David/0000-0002-0228-0611; Teasdale, Peter/0000-0001-9891-0560; 													0749-0208	1551-5036				NOV	2013	29	6A		S			156	167		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-12-00219.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-12-00219.1													WOS:000327567200016
J	Zhang, ZQ; Yang, MX; Li, L; Yin, R; Huo, LL				Zhang, Zhenqing; Yang, Mingxiang; Li, Lin; Yin, Rui; Huo, Lili			Holocene terrestrialization process on the Sanjiang Plain (China) and its significance to the East Asian summer monsoon circulation	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												A wide-spread terrestrialization process has been reported occurring across the Sanjiang Plain in the Holocene Epoch, while little is known for its detailed process and links to regional climate variation. Here, we present high-resolution palynological and lithological data of a peatland's sedimentary profile in the central Sanjiang Plain. The study aims to reconstruct the local terrestrialization process and discuss its significance to the Holocene East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) evolution. The results indicate that a paleolake surrounded by broadleaved forests developed during-7.4-4.5 ka BP, corresponding to a wet and warm stage with strengthened EASM. Thereafter, a wetland dominated by Cyperaceae and Poaceae was initiated with the terrestrialization process. This process lasted until 3.9 ka BP when a lithological mud-to-peat transition occurred indicating a peatland began to develop after the extinction of the paleolake. Considering the prevalent EASM climate on the modern Sanjiang Plain, this paleolake-to-peatland transition during 4.5-3.9 ka BP was attributed to the mid-Holocene EASM retreat in addition to the paleolake's autogenic infilling process. During the peatland developing stage, four dry intervals with weakened EASM occurred in 3.9-3.2 ka BP, 2.0-1.3 ka BP, 1.0-0.5 ka BP, and 0.1-0.0 ka BP. They were alternated with three wet stages of the strengthened EASM during 3.2-2.0 ka BP, 1.3-1.0 ka BP, and 0.5-0.1 ka BP. Our findings are supported by a series of paleoclimatic records across the monsoonal regions of China. We suggest that the EASM evolution associated with the tropical ocean-atmosphere interactions was initially modulated by the solar output variation. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

We measured changes in delta O-18(LW) at four lakes (Nanyihu, Gonghai, Mayinghai and Xihaizi) at various locations across the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) region, from December 2016 to January 2018. The variations in delta O-18(LW) at Lake Nanyihu, located in the lower reach of the Yangtze River, are controlled by precipitation oxygen isotope (delta O-18(P)) composition, temperature and evaporation during the non-monsoon season. However, the variations in delta O-18(LW) at the lakes close to the northern limit of the EASM (Gonghai, Mayinghai and Xihaizi) are affected not only by delta O-18(P), temperature and evaporation, but also by the replenishment of groundwater during the non-monsoon season. In general, during the non-monsoon season, the variation of delta O-18(LW) exhibits a variety of patterns and the controlling factors across the EASM region are complex. During the monsoon season, although the effect of evaporation-induced isotopic enrichment still affects delta O-18(LW), the variations in delta O-18(LW) are more influenced by the supply of abundant precipitation with lower delta O-18(P) to the lakes, which caused a substantial decrease in delta O-18(LW) across the EASM region in this season. Therefore, the variations in delta O-18(LW) mainly reflect the delta O-18(P) of the EASM during the monsoon season. However, the timing of the peak in monsoon precipitation does not correspond well to minima in delta O-18(LW), and correlation analysis reveals that there is only a weak relationship between delta O-18(LW) and precipitation/humidity at all four lakes during the monsoon season. These findings demonstrate that although delta O-18(LW) can represent the delta O-18(P) of the EASM, it does not reflect precipitation/humidity during the monsoon season. Overall, our findings indicate that the seasonal variations of delta O-18(LW) across the EASM region are controlled by different climatic variables, which implies that the interpretation of lacustrine delta O-18 records across the EASM region as an indicator of regional effective precipitation/humidity needs to be reassessed.					; Liu, Xiaokang/AAE-8795-2019; Fahu, Chen/B-2788-2011; Liu, jianbao/X-3646-2019; Chen, Shengqian/ABA-5944-2021; Zhang, Zhiping/MVY-0861-2025; Shen, Zhongwei/KDO-9452-2024	Zhang, Zhiping/0000-0001-8388-9631; Liu, Xiaokang/0000-0001-8732-0338; Zhang, Xiaosen/0000-0002-8069-8095; Chen, Fahu/0000-0002-8874-1035; 													0309-1333	1477-0296				AUG	2020	44	4					572	588	0309133319896338	10.1177/0309133319896338	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0309133319896338		DEC 2019											WOS:000506779700001

Winter air temperature in Holocene reconstructed from the ice wedges stable water isotopes near Anadyr town	LED I SNEG-ICE AND SNOW												The object of research is syncryogenic Holocene strata on the coast of the Onemen Bay, 2 km from the town of Anadyr. In July 2017, the outcrop of the first marine terrace uncovered by strong storms was examined. The stratigraphy of the outcrop was represented mainly by sandy loam (5-7 m thick) covered by peat (1-1.5 m) and underlain by sand. Numerous ice wedges were opened in the upper part of this outcrop. Along with that another outcropping of transect of a lake-marsh basin represented by a peat bog of 2-2.5 m thick underlain by sandy loam was also investigated. Ice wedges occur below the polygonal trenches. The present-day narrow ice wedges were found in the upper part of the peat bog. Two representative fragments of both the above outcrops were thoroughly examined. Radiocarbon dating had shown that accumulation of peat on surface of the first marine terrace started in early Holocene (about 8 ka BP). Accumulation of peatland within the lake-marsh basin was also dated to the beginning of the Holocene (about 9 ka BP). In the middle of the Holocene, it was most likely interrupted as a result of thermokarst processes and bogging of the surface. Formation of peatlands in Chukotka during the Holocene is known to be accompanied by active growth of the ice wedges inside them, so the age of the wedges studied by us was estimated as the beginning of the Holocene. The analysis of stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in the Holocene and the modern ice wedges had allowed establishing mainly the atmospheric type of moisture feeding of the wedges (due to melted snow) and lack of noticeable isotope fractionation during the ice formation. It has been found that delta O-18 and delta H-2 values in the Holocene ice wedges were lower than in the modern wedges and snow by an average 2-3 and 7-12 parts per thousand, respectively. Paleotemperature reconstructions performed on the basis of isotope-oxygen data showed that the air temperature of the coldest winter month in the first half of the Holocene in the Onemen Bay area was lower than the present-day ones by an average 2-3 degrees C, which is in a good agreement with the trend of rising winter temperatures throughout the Chukotka Peninsula, as well as in other areas of Eastern Siberia and Alaska.

Emergence timing and subsequent downstream movements of two non-native salmonids in a Lake Superior tributary	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We describe patterns of emergence and downstream movement by recently emerged fry of two non-native salmonids in the Great Lakes region, North America. Our primary objectives were to describe the timing of emergence in relation to spring flooding, and to examine the effects of reach-level complexity of stream habitat on rates of movement. Emergence and movement patterns of coho salmon and brown trout fry were assessed over an eight-week period in two reaches distinguished by differences in channel woody debris. Fry emergence occurred from mid-March to early May, and peaked in early to mid-April. Movement during this period was uncorrelated with upstream densities of resident fry and fish moving downstream did not appear moribund or in poor condition. Nearly twice as many fish moved through the simple reach that lacked woody debris cover even though upstream densities of resident fry were generally greater in the complex reach. The results reported here indicate that peak emergence occurs in close association with the timing of spring floods. Variability in the timing of either emergence or spring floods could have profound effects on the size of coho salmon and brown trout populations within streams of this region. Results from this study further suggest that greater habitat complexity may reduce downstream movements of newly emerged salmonid fry in a natural system.

Evidence for Range Contraction of Snowshoe Hare in Pennsylvania	NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST												In Pennsylvania, Lepus americanus (Snowshoe Hare) is near the southern limits of its range and at risk of range contraction because of loss of early-successional forest and impacts of climate change. We used hunter-harvest data to investigate changes in the distribution of Snowshoe Hare in Pennsylvania (1983-2011), forest inventory and land-use data to assess changes in amount and distribution of early-successional forest (1988-2011), and occupancy modeling (2004) to identify habitat and climate variables that explain the current distribution of Snowshoe Hare. We determined presence of Snowshoe Hare based on visual sightings, observations of tracks, and DNA analysis of fecal pellets, and used repeated visits to sampling sites and occupancy models to estimate occupancy rates (Psi). Hunter-harvest data indicated the range of Snowshoe Hare in Pennsylvania contracted towards northwestern and northeastern portions of the state. Based on occupancy modeling, Snowshoe Hare were most likely to occupy early-successional and mixed deciduous-coniferous forest types and areas with colder winter temperatures, which coincided with the distribution of hunter harvests. Among the 4 forest types, we estimated Psi = 0.52-0.79 and Psi = 0.10-0.32 where winter temperatures were coldest and warmest, respectively. Total forest loss was <1% during 1988-2011, and the loss of early-successional forest in the current and former range of Snowshoe Hares was similar as were mean patch size and a fragmentation metric of early-successional habitat. Thus, changes in forest characteristics did not explain the range contraction we observed. We used climate-model predictions and our occupancy model to predict that average occupancy probability across northern Pennsylvania may decline from 0.27 in 2004 to 0.10-0.18 by 2050-2059, depending on the climate model. The range of Snowshoe Hare in Pennsylvania has contracted to regions of Pennsylvania with the coldest winter temperatures and most persistent snowpack, and based on projected climate change, our results suggest further range contraction of Snowshoe Hare in Pennsylvania.

J	van der Schriek, T; Giannakopoulos, C				van der Schriek, Tim; Giannakopoulos, Christos			Reconstructing absolute water-level variability of Lake Prespa (SW Balkans) during the Medieval Climate Anomaly and "Little Ice Age' from a prograding beach ridge complex	HOLOCENE												Lake Prespa beach ridges register climate-driven water-level fluctuations that contain a strong North Atlantic signal. This study examines the beach ridge complex that underlies the Koula isthmus (Lake Prespa, Greece) and contains a sedimentary archive of lake-level variations spanning >5 kyr. Past lake levels were reconstructed through the accurate height survey of selected beach sediment facies that form reliable stage indicators. Here, we present the first quantitative lake level recorded in the Balkans, covering similar to 1 kyr, based on sediment-stratigraphic analyses and supported by five radiocarbon and six optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) age estimates. All major low/high lake phases over the past millennium were identified and dated in the sediment record. Low lake levels (842-847 m) from AD 900-1000 to AD 1430 dominated the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA). Generally, high water levels (>847 m) are recorded after AD similar to 1430, corresponding to the regional start of the Little Ice Age' (LIA), up to AD 1987. This high lake phase was interspersed by a multi-decadal water-level fall to similar to 846.5 m ending AD similar to 1650. Low levels after AD 1987 (842-845 m) were mainly caused by water abstraction. Absolute water-level changes in Lake Prespa over the past millennium mirror the pattern of hydro-climatic changes in the west-central Mediterranean, indicating that the study region belonged to this hydro-climatic domain. The observed influence of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) on winter precipitation and lake level (1951-2004) is also relevant over the past similar to 1 kyr, as the NAO index was overall positive during the MCA and negative during the LIA'.					; Giannakopoulos, Christos/H-6827-2014; van der Schriek, Tim/D-1495-2009	van der Schriek, Tim/0000-0003-4379-3349; Giannakopoulos, Christos/0000-0003-1822-7716; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				NOV	2017	27	11					1720	1730		10.1177/0959683617708449	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683617708449													WOS:000415000900009

The increase in the maximum allowable outflow limit from Lake Superior will provide flexibility in maintaining more stable water level in the lower Great Lakes. The effect of increasing the wintertime flow limit in the Lower St. Marys River is examined using a two-dimensional river hydro-thermo-ice dynamics model. Simulations of freeze-up, undercover frazil transport and accumulation, and breakup ice jams with different combinations of water discharge and downstream water levels were simulated. The simulation results showed that with the high winter flow there will be significant increases in water levels in the area of the Little Rapids gauge and the US Slip gauge downstream of the US Locks due to breakup jams. The water level at the Cloverland Electric Cooperative (CEC) tailrace may increase above the allowable limit, which is the flood threshold at the Cloverland Electric Company Hydro Plant. A series of breakup simulations were made to determine the safe discharge to avoid ice jam flooding. These simulations show that the winter flow limit could be increased to 2690 m(3)/s from the current limit of 2410 m(3)/s given by Plan 1977-A, if flow regulation is managed with care by avoiding rapid changes in flow rate and water level to prevent premature ice cover breakup.

Enhancing Engagement of Citizen Scientists to Monitor Precipitation Phase	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE												Recent literature has highlighted how citizen science approaches can engage volunteers, expand scientific literacy, and accomplish targeted research objectives. However, there is limited information on how specific recruitment, retention, and engagement strategies enhance scientific outcomes. To help fill this important information gap, we detail the use of various approaches to engage citizen scientists in the collection of precipitation phase data (rain, snow, or mixed). In our study region, the Sierra Nevada and Central Basin and Range of California and Nevada near Lake Tahoe, a marked amount of annual precipitation falls near freezing. At these air temperatures, weather forecasts, land surface models, and satellites all have difficulty correctly predicting and observing precipitation phase, making visual observations the most accurate approach. From January to May 2020, citizen scientists submitted timestamped, geotagged observations of precipitation phase through the Citizen Science Tahoe mobile phone application. Our recruitment strategy included messaging to winter, weather, and outdoor enthusiasts combined with amplification through regional groups, which resulted in over 199 citizen scientists making 1,003 ground-based observations of rain, snow, and mixed precipitation. We enhanced engagement and retention by targeting specific storms in the region through text message alerts that also allowed for questions, clarifications, and training opportunities. We saw a high retention rate (88%) and a marked increase in the number of observations following alerts. For quality control of the data, we combined various meteorological datasets and compared to the citizen science observations. We found that 96.5% of submitted data passed our quality control protocol, which enabled us to evaluate rain-snow partitioning patterns. Snow was the dominant form of precipitation at air temperatures below and slightly above freezing, with both ecoregions expressing a 50% rain-snow air temperature threshold of 4.2 degrees C, a warmer value than what would be incorporated into most land surface models. Thus, the use of a lower air temperature threshold in these areas would produce inaccuracies in event-based rain-snow proportions. Overall, our high retention rate, data quality, and rain-snow analysis were supported by the recruitment strategy, text message communication, and simplicity of the survey design. We suggest other citizen science projects may follow the approaches detailed herein to achieve their scientific objectives.																				2296-6463				FEB 18	2021	9								617594	10.3389/feart.2021.617594	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2021.617594													WOS:000625201200001

Here, we report the first comprehensive temporal study of bacterial and archaeal communities from an extensive range of geothermal features in Aotearoa-New Zealand. One hundred and fifteen water column samples from 31 geothermal ecosystems were taken over a 34-month period to ascertain microbial community stability (control sites), community response to both natural and anthropogenic disturbances in the local environment (disturbed sites) and temporal variation in spring diversity across different pH values (pH 3, 5, 7, 9) all at a similar temperature of 60-70 degrees C (pH sites). Identical methodologies were employed to measure microbial diversity via 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, along with 44 physicochemical parameters from each feature, to ensure confidence in comparing samples across timeframes. Our results indicated temperature and associated groundwater physicochemistry were the most likely parameters to vary stochastically in these geothermal features, with community abundances rather than composition more readily affected by a changing environment. However, variation in pH (pH +/- 1) had a more significant effect on community structure than temperature (+/- 20 degrees C), with alpha diversity failing to adequately measure temporal microbial disparity in geothermal features outside of circumneutral conditions. While a substantial physicochemical disturbance was required to shift community structures at the phylum level, geothermal ecosystems were resilient at this broad taxonomic rank and returned to a pre-disturbed state if environmental conditions re-established. These findings highlight the diverse controls between different microbial communities within the same habitat-type, expanding our understanding of temporal dynamics in extreme ecosystems.

J	PRISCU, JC				PRISCU, JC			INSITU QUANTUM YIELD OF PHYTOPLANKTON IN A SUBALPINE LAKE	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The percent of light absorbed by algae, estimated from a regression of attenuation of downwelling photosynthetic photon flux density on chlorophyll a concentration, was used conjunction with measurements of phytoplankton photosynthesis to estimate quantum yields (.PHI.) of Castle Lake phytoplankton populations during the 1980 ice-free season. The maximum .PHI. values occurred during mid-summer in the deep hypolimnion (< 1% of surface photo flux) and were .apprx. 78% of the theoretical maximum. Later in the season (Sept.) the deep-water .PHI. values decreased significantly to .apprx. 27% of the theoretical maximum in conjunction with a decrease in quantum flux density of these waters. The .PHI. values for epilimnetic phytoplankton populations were never > 15% of the theoretical maximum. The presence of relatively high concentrations of peridinin and chlorophyll c in the deep-water algae enabled these organisms to absorb the predominantly green light in this region of the lake which allowed the use of a single extinction value per unit of chlorophyll (kc) at all depths when calculating .PHI. and increased the .PHI. of the deep-water algae, relative to those in the near-surface waters. The deep-water algae in Castle Lake were able to utilize their ambient light field, particularly in the early summer, and the deep-chlorophyll layer in this lake is maintained primarily by in situ algal growth rather than sinking and accumulation of organisms from near surface waters.																			0142-7873	1464-3774					1984	6	4					531	542		10.1093/plankt/6.4.531	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/6.4.531													WOS:A1984SZ52900001
J	Chikita, KA; Oyagi, H; Amita, K				Chikita, Kazuhisa A.; Oyagi, Hideo; Amita, Kazuhiro			A Thermal Regime and a Water Circulation in a Very Deep Lake: Lake Tazawa, Japan	HYDROLOGY												A thermal system in the very deep Lake Tazawa (maximum depth, 423 m) was investigated by estimating the heat budget. In the heat budget estimate, the net heat input at the lake's surface and the heat input by river inflow and groundwater inflow were considered. Then, the heat loss by snowfall onto the lake's surface was taken into account. Meanwhile, the lake water temperature was monitored at 0.2 m to the bottom by mooring temperature loggers for more than two years. The heat storage change of the lake from the loggers was calibrated by frequent vertical measurements of water temperature at every 0.1 m pitch by a profiler with high accuracy (+/- 0.01 degrees C). The heat storage change (W/m2) obtained by the temperature loggers reasonably accorded to that from the heat budget estimate. In the heat budget, the net heat input at lake surface dominated the heat storage change, but significant heat loss by river inflow sporadically occurred, caused by the relatively large discharge from a reservoir in the upper region. How deeply the vertical water circulation in the lake occurs in winter was judged according to the differences between water temperatures at 0.2 m depth and at the bottom and between vertical profiles of dissolved oxygen over winter. It is strongly suggested that the whole water circulation process does not occur every winter, and if it does, it is very weak. A consistent increase in the water temperature at the bottom is probably due to the conservation of geothermal heat by high frequency of incomplete vertical water circulation.

The influence of winter severity, predation and senescence on moose habitat use	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												Habitat use is widely known to be influenced by abiotic and biotic factors, such as climate, population density, foraging opportunity and predation risk. The influence of the life-history state of an individual organism on habitat use is less well understood, especially for terrestrial mammals. There is good reason to expect that life-history state would affect habitat use. For example, organisms exhibiting poor condition associated with senescence have an increased vulnerability to predation and that vulnerability is known to alter habitat use strategies. We assessed the influence of life-history stage on habitat use for 732 moose (Alces alces) killed by wolves (Canis lupus) over a 50-year period in Isle Royale National Park, an island ecosystem in Lake Superior, USA. We developed regression models to assess how location of death was associated with a moose's life-history stage (prime-aged or senescent), presence or absence of senescent-associated pathology (osteoarthritis and jaw necrosis), and annual variation in winter severity, moose density and ratio of moose to wolves, which is an index of predation risk. Compared to senescent moose, prime-aged moose tend to make greater use of habitat farther from the shoreline of Isle Royale. That result is ecologically relevant because shoreline habitat on Isle Royale tends to provide better foraging opportunities for moose but is also associated with increased predation risk. During severe winters prime-aged moose tend to make greater use of habitat that is closer to shore in relation to senescent-aged moose. Furthermore, moose of both age classes were more likely to die in riskier, shoreline habitat during years when predation risk was lower in the preceding year. Our results highlight a complicated connection between life history, age-structured population dynamics and habitat-related behaviour. Our analysis also illustrates why intraspecific competition should not be the presumed mechanism underlying density-dependent habitat use, if predation risk is related to density, as it is expected to be in many systems.

Acute Effects of Drought on Emergent and Aquatic Communities in a Brackish Marsh	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												Plants and animals in brackish marshes are adapted to live within a wide, yet finite, range of conditions. Events that shift the environmental state beyond that range can dramatically alter habitats and, potentially, the numerous ecosystem services they provide. A prolonged exceptional drought in Texas (October 2010-January 2012) provided a unique opportunity to understand how brackish wetland habitats respond to an extreme environmental event. We examined marshes in the Lower Neches Wildlife Management Area (Texas, USA) that fell within the drought affected area, including restored areas and an adjacent reference marsh. To test our hypothesis that the brackish marsh community would be sensitive to drought conditions, we quantified emergent plant and submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) and animal (invertebrates, fish) characteristics in summer 2010 and 2011. In spite of its severity, the exceptional drought of 2011 did not have a negative impact on emergent plant communities: biomass, stem density, and chlorophyll a concentrations were the same in pre-drought and drought years in all restored and reference areas. In contrast, SAV biomass was reduced by up to 100 % in the drought year. Some fish and invertebrate densities were also reduced by an order of magnitude or more, possibly due to the loss of SAV. Aquatic faunal species composition was markedly different in the drought year, largely due to the loss of the hydrobiid snail Probythinella protera and the gain of some marine species, including Gulf menhaden (Brevoortia patronus), brown shrimp (Farfantepenaeus aztecus), and white shrimp (Litopenaeus setiferus). By altering aquatic the plant and animal community, this drought event may subsequently reduce trophic support for higher consumers, or contribute to a decline in water quality. Restoration monitoring programs that only focus on relatively stress-resistant, emergent wetland plant communities may underestimate the sensitivity of these ecosystems to extreme environmental events like droughts.

A dramatic recovery of Lake Spokane water quality following wastewater phosphorus reduction	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Lake Spokane became hypereutrophic due to nutrient input from a municipal wastewater facility. Following a 1977 reduction inwastewater total phosphorus (TP) from about 5 to 0.5 mg/L, lakewater quality and trophic state recovered rather quickly, going from hypereutrophy to meso-eutrophy in the first 7 years. After TP reduction, mean summer (Jun-Oct) inflow TP declined from 86 to 25 mu g/L during that 7-year period. Mean summer epilimnetic chlorophyll (Chl) declined from 21 to 11 mu g/L, and the mean volume-weighted (v-w) hypolimnetic seasonal minimum dissolved oxygen (DO) increased from 1.4 to 4.5 mg/L over that same period. Recent data (2010-2014) demonstrate continued recovery to meso-oligotrophy with the 5-year average minimum hypolimnetic v-w DO at 6.5 mg/L and mean inflow TP and epilimnetic Chl at 15 and 4 mu g/L, respectively. The areal hypolimnetic oxygen deficit (AHOD) rate now averages 0.67 +/- 0.12 g/m(2) per day, which is 84% less than the pre TP-reduction AHOD (median 4.2 g/m(2) per day). This recovery in DO indicators may be the clearest case of recovery from severe eutrophication for a reservoir, which usually have higher AHODs than lakes. The recovery confirms the close link among TP inflow concentration, Chl, and DO in reservoirs, despite their relatively large watersheds and inflows that produce high nutrient loadings compared to natural lakes. The results show that reduction of phosphorus recovered the lake to meso-oligotrophy, even though nitrogen was initially limiting as much or more than phosphorus during hypereutrophy, and despite markedly increased inflow nitrogen since 2000.																			1040-2381	2151-5530					2015	31	2					157	165		10.1080/10402381.2015.1040566	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2015.1040566													WOS:000360248500008

J	Wasserstein, ML; Steenburgha, WJ				Wasserstein, Michael L.; Steenburgha, W. James			Diverse Characteristics of Extreme Orographic Snowfall Events in Little Cottonwood Canyon, Utah	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												Heavy orographic snowfall can disrupt transportation and threaten lives and property in mountainous regions but benefits water resources, winter sports, and tourism. Little Cottonwood Canyon (LCC) in northern Utah's Wasatch Range is one of the snowiest locations in the interior western United States and frequently observes orographic snowfall extremes with threats to transportation, structures, and public safety due to storm -related avalanche hazards. Using manual new -snow and liquid precipitation equivalent (LPE) observations, ERA5 reanalyses, and operational radar data, this paper examines the characteristics of cool -season (October-April) 12-h snowfall extremes in upper LCC. The 12-h extremes, defined based on either 95th percentile new snow or LPE, occur for a wide range of crest -level flow directions. The distribution of LPE extremes is bimodal with maxima for south-southwest or north-northwest flow, whereas new -snow extremes occur most frequently during west-northwest flow, which features colder storms with higher snow -toliquid ratios. Both snowfall and LPE extremes are produced by diverse synoptic patterns, including inland -penetrating or decaying atmospheric rivers from the south through northwest that avoid the southern high Sierra Nevada, frontal systems, post -cold -frontal northwesterly flow, south -southwesterly cold -core flow, and closed low pressure systems. Although often associated with heavy precipitation in other mountainous regions, the linkages between local integrated water vapor transport (IVT) and orographic precipitation extremes in LCC are relatively weak, and during post -cold -frontal northwesterly flow, highly localized and intense snowfall can occur despite low IVT. These results illustrate the remarkable diversity of storm characteristics producing orographic snowfall extremes at this interior continental mountain location.																			0027-0644	1520-0493				APR	2024	152	4					945	966		10.1175/MWR-D-23-0206.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/MWR-D-23-0206.1													WOS:001189687500001

The primary goal of this interdisciplinary study was to evaluate the microbial populations inhabiting thermal vent communities in Yellowstone Lake using 16S rRNA gene and random metagenome sequencing, and to determine how geochemical attributes of vent waters influence the distribution of specific microorganisms and their metabolic potential. Thermal vent waters and associated microbial biomass were sampled during two field seasons (2007-2008) using a remotely operated vehicle (ROV). Sublacustrine thermal vent waters (circa 50-90 degrees C) contained elevated concentrations of numerous constituents associated with geothermal activity including dissolved hydrogen, sulfide, methane and carbon dioxide. Microorganisms associated with sulfur-rich filamentous "streamer" communities of Inflated Plain and West Thumb (pH range 5-6) were dominated by bacteria from the Aquificales, but also contained thermophilic archaea from the Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota. Novel groups of methanogens and members of the Korarchaeota were observed in vents from West Thumb and Elliot's Crater (pH 5-6). Conversely, metagenome sequence from Mary Bay vent sediments did not yield large assemblies, and contained diverse thermophilic and nonthermophilic bacterial relatives. Analysis of functional genes associated with the major vent populations indicated a direct linkage to high concentrations of carbon dioxide, reduced sulfur (sulfide and/or elemental S), hydrogen and methane in the deep thermal ecosystems. Our observations show that sublacustrine thermal vents in Yellowstone Lake support novel thermophilic communities, which contain microorganisms with functional attributes not found to date in terrestrial geothermal systems of YNP.					; Kan, Jinjun/C-5252-2011	Yooseph, Shibu/0000-0001-5581-5002; Jay, Zackary/0000-0003-3062-4933; Clingenpeel, Scott/0000-0002-6619-6320													1664-302X					OCT 26	2015	6								1044	10.3389/fmicb.2015.01044	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2015.01044								26579074					WOS:000364156900001

The summer daily precipitation records of 158 meteorological raingauges are applied over the HB during the period of 1980-2007, and the precipitation samples are classified into unconditional rainy days and conditional rainy days which have a dry or wet preceding day over the years. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test and the comparison between the Gamma distribution probability density function and the sample frequency of daily precipitation records of five representative stations are conducted and analyzed. The results show that the HB is a "scale-dominated" region characterized with large scale parameters of the Gamma distribution, where rainfall is likely to exhibit large variability leading to extreme wet or dry conditions. Further analysis shows that the confluence area of Sha River and Ying River within the stream between Wangjiaba dam and Bengbu station, the eastern branch of the Huaihe River (HR) between Bengbu station and the Hongze Lake, and the downstream area below the Hongze Lake, are all the areas with a high probability of large precipitation under the condition that the rainy day has a dry preceding day. The eastern part of the Yishu River watershed and the region near Wangjiaba darn are the center of a high probability of large precipitation under the condition that the rainy day has a wet preceding day. Moreover, the day following a dry preceding day has a greater probability of small rainfall. The probability distribution of summer daily precipitation of the HB is significantly skewed. The probability distribution could be more applicable if the rainy days are preceded by a dry or wet day.																			0894-0525					FEB	2012	26	1					72	84		10.1007/s13351-012-0107-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13351-012-0107-2													WOS:000302927800007

Paul			A statistical framework for testing impacts of multiple drivers of surface water quality in nearshore regions of large lakes	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												In nearshore regions of large freshwater ecosystems, complex biophysical processes across large geographic regions, combined with the common logistical challenges of data collection by multiple research agencies and shifting monitoring survey designs over time, present challenges for detecting and managing the influence of multiple sources of nutrients and pollution. We present a statistical framework using linear mixed models (LMMs) to test impact of multiple drivers on nearshore water quality of large lakes. Under this framework, we analysed a 12-year dataset of water quality variables that were measured from a nearshore region along the Canadian shoreline of Lake Ontario (similar to 86 km(2)), near Pickering and Ajax. Spatial interpolation showed that almost all water quality parameters decreased in magnitude from the shoreline to the offshore. Two exceptions to this nearshore-offshore gradient occurred in a region that extended similar to 8 km southwest from the outfall of the Duffin Creek Water Pollution Control Plant (DCWPCP) where ammonia + ammonium (NH3+4) increased and pH decreased slightly. Other LMMs combined explanatory factors into major groups (geographic proximities to shoreline tributary mouths and stormwater drains [inflows], tributary discharges, discharge or loading from the DCWPCP, and climate factors). These models showed that geographic proximity to shoreline inflows and/or tributary discharges were the most important drivers for most water quality parameters including concentrations of phosphorus, a key variable for regulating proliferation of harmful algae blooms and nuisance benthic algae in the Great lakes. Air temperature was correlated with decreased phosphorus concentrations and nitrate + nitrite, whereas total precipitation and snow were correlated with increased concentrations of most nutrients except NH3+4, which was negatively correlated with duration of lake ice cover in winter. Our framework highlights how influence of individual nutrient sources can be distinguished from climate factors within a dominant nearshore-offshore gradient in water quality within nearshore regions of large lakes.

The results reveal the strong control of the Asian summer monsoon (ASM) strength on vegetation via orbitally-induced variations in Northern Hemisphere summer solar insolation. The trend of climatic evolution of the region consists of change from a warm temperate-northern subtropical climate (20,400-18,700 cal yr BP) to a southern subtropical climate (16,500-11,500 cal yr BP) during the last deglaciation, followed by a stepwise environmental shift from a tropical climate (11,500-8200 cal yr BP), to a southern subtropical climate (8200-6600 cal yr BP) and finally to a middle-northern subtropical climate. The Bolling-Allerod warming is characterized by the highest percentages of evergreen Quercus but the lowest percentages of xerophytic Gramineae throughout the record, suggesting intensified warm, wet conditions during 15,000-13,000 cal yr BP. By contrast, the Younger Dryas is characterized by a marked decrease in subtropical evergreen broad-leaved plants but a significant increase in herbaceous taxa, representing a brief cold reversal during 13,000-12,000 cal yr BP. The occurrence of two major cooling events at 8.2 and 6.6 kyr BP, both of which are characterized by dramatic decreases in tropical evergreen broad-leaved plants, is supposed to be linked to a distinct weakening of the ASM and southward migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone associated with marked declines in Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. The subsequent brief intervals of high herbaceous pollen percentages but low percentages of tropical taxa correspond to high El Nitio/Southem Oscillation (ENSO) activity, supporting a link between the weakening of solar isolation-driven ASM strength and a gradual intensification of ENSO.

Multivariate statistical analysis of chironomid and environmental data from the combined data set consisting of 268 lakes, located in northern Russia, suggests that mean July air temperature explains the greatest amount of variance in chironomid distribution compared with other measured variables (latitude, longitude, altitude, water depth, lake surface area, pH, conductivity, mean January air temperature, mean July air temperature, and continentality). We established two robust inference models to reconstruct mean summer air temperatures from subfossil chironomids based on ecological and geographical approaches. The North Russian 2-component WA-PLS model (RMSEPJack = 1.35 degrees C, r(Jack)(2) = 0.87) can be recommended for application in palaeoclimatic studies in northern Russia.

J	Dimitriou, E; Zacharias, I				Dimitriou, Elias; Zacharias, Ierotheos			Applying isotopic techniques and remote sensing for water resources management an a lake catchment	WATER INTERNATIONAL												Tracing groundwater flows and understanding the recharge regime of karstic springs is a difficult but necessary task for quantifying groundwater storages and developing water management scenarios. The area of the present study is Trichonis Lake catchment, in western Greece, which incorporates a deep and large water body, tectonic in origin, with complex hydrogeologic conditions. The potential hydrogeologic interactions between the lake, various aquifers and surface water bodies in the catchment area have been identified in order to design a sustainable water management scheme for the lake. For this purpose, state-of-the-art techniques have been used such as remote sensing, GIS applications, and isotopic surveys, to analyze and present the dominant groundwater flow routes inside and outside the study catchment area, and to identify the recharge areas of karstic springs. The results indicate that the combination of the techniques used is useful to analyze the hydrogeologic regime in geologically complex catchments.

Optical properties of riverine dissolved organic matter and influence of precipitation - a case study	OPTOELECTRONICS AND ADVANCED MATERIALS-RAPID COMMUNICATIONS												The study aimed to determine the optical characteristics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from two rivers with different pollution sources, using fluorescence spectroscopy and spectrophotometry, two highly sensitive and selective optoelectronic methods. Results showed that the release of wastewater effluent in Ciorogarla River changed the optical properties of riverine DOM and its relationship with standard parameters. It was also found that Sabar River samples presented high DOM concentrations and an accumulation of autochthonous matter towards mid-autumn. Although the study was performed on specific rivers, the knowledge that was obtained could be used as reference for other aquatic systems.

J	Quamar, MF				Quamar, M. Firoze			Vegetation dynamics in response to climate change from the wetlands of Western Himalaya, India: Holocene Indian summer monsoon variability	HOLOCENE												India's agricultural output, economy and societal well-being are strappingly dependent on the stability of the southwest summer monsoon precipitation, its variability and extremes. Deviations in the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) precipitation may profoundly impact the agricultural productivity and gross domestic product (GDP) of the country. Understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of the ISM precipitation during the Holocene is significant in many respects, particularly in terms of human development and establishment of centres of civilisations. Here, pollen records of the variability in ISM precipitation and their interpretation in terms of vegetation and climate change from two wetlands (Gharana and Nanga; Ramsar sites) of the Western Himalaya (India) is presented. The results suggest that between similar to 8536 and 5296 cal yr BP, mixed conifer/broad-leaved forests occurred in the Jammu region (Gharana Wetland sediment profile) under a cool and dry climate, probably indicating decreased monsoon precipitation. Subsequently, they were succeeded by mixed broad-leaved/conifer forests between similar to 5296 and 2776 cal yr BP under a warm and humid climate with increased monsoon precipitation, partly corresponding to the Holocene Climate Optimum (HCO). Between similar to 2776 and 1376 cal yr BP, with more expansion of broad-leaved forest elements in response to a warm and more humid climate the dense mixed broad-leaved/conifer forests came into existence in the region, indicating a further increase in monsoon precipitation. From similar to 1376 cal yr BP to present, the climate deteriorated, as manifested by the replacement of dense mixed broad-leaved/conifer forests by mixed conifer/broad-leaved forests in the region. The palaeoclimatic inferences drawn from the Nanga Wetland sediment profile of Samba District match with the Gharana Wetland sediment profile of Jammu District for the late-Holocene. This study provides insights into the vegetation dynamics, associated climate change and the ISM variability from the poorly understood wetland ecosystems of Southeast Asia during the Holocene.																			0959-6836	1477-0911				FEB	2019	29	2					345	362		10.1177/0959683618810401	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683618810401													WOS:000459887400013
J	Hahnenberger, M; Nicoll, K				Hahnenberger, Maura; Nicoll, Kathleen			Geomorphic and land cover identification of dust sources in the eastern Great Basin of Utah, USA	GEOMORPHOLOGY												This study identifies anthropogenically disturbed areas and barren playa surfaces as the two primary dust source types that repeatedly contribute to dust storm events in the eastern Great Basin of western Utah, U.S.A. This semi-arid desert region is an important contributor to dust production in North America, with this study being the first to specifically identify and characterize regional dust sources. From 2004 to 2010, a total of 51 dust event days (DEDs) affected the air quality in Salt Lake City, UT. MODIS satellite imagery during 16 of these DEDs was analyzed to identify dust plumes, and assess the characteristics of dust source areas. A total of 168 plumes were identified, and showed mobilization of dust from Quaternary deposits located within the Bonneville Basin. This analysis identifies 4 major and 5 secondary source areas for dust in this region, which produce dust primarily during the spring and fall months and during moderate or greater drought conditions, with a Palmer Drought Index (PDI) of 2 or less. The largest number of observed dust plumes (similar to 60% of all plumes) originated from playas (ephemeral lakes) and are classified as barren land cover with a silty clay soil sediment surface. Playa surfaces in this region undergo numerous recurrent anthropogenic disturbances, including military operations and anthropogenic water withdrawal. Anthropogenic disturbance is necessary to produce dust from the vegetated landscape in the eastern Great Basin, as evidenced by the new dust source active from 2008 to 2010 in the area burned by the 2007 Milford Flat Fire; this fire was the largest in Utah's history due to extensive cover of invasive cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) along with drought conditions. However, dust mobilization from the Milford Flat Burned Area was limited to regions that had been significantly disturbed by post-fire land management techniques that consisted of seeding, followed by chaining or tilling of the soil. Dust storms in the eastern Great Basin negatively impact air quality and transportation in the populated regions of Utah; this study details an improved forecasting protocol for dust storm events that will benefit transportation planning and improve public health.

J	Peterson, C; Gustin, M				Peterson, Christianna; Gustin, Mae			Mercury in the air, water and biota at the Great Salt Lake (Utah, USA)	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The Great Salt Lake, Utah (USA), is the fourth largest terminal lake on Earth and a stop-over location for 35 million birds on the Pacific Flyway. Recently, the Utah Department of Health and Utah Division of Wildlife Resources issued tissue mercury (Hg) consumption advisories for several species of birds that consume the lake's brine shrimp. We hypothesized that the chemistry of the atmosphere above the Great Salt Lake would facilitate atmospheric deposition of Hg to the water. Because little information was available on Hg at the Great Salt Lake, and to begin to test this hypothesis, we measured atmospheric elemental (Hg-0) and reactive gaseous mercury (RGM) concentrations as well as Hg concentrations in water and brine shrimp five times over a similar to year. Surrogate surfaces and a dry deposition model were applied to estimate the amount of Hg that could be input to the lake surface, and HYSPLIT model back trajectories were developed to investigate potential sources of RGM to the lake. Atmospheric Hg-0 concentrations were similar to global ambient background values and RGM concentrations were similar to those reported for rural areas. Both Hg-0 and RGM exhibited regular diel variability. Model estimated deposition velocities for RGM to the lake ranged from 0.9 to 3.0 cm s(-1) while that determined for surrogate surfaces ranged from 2.8 to 7.8 cm s(-1). Filtered total and methyl Hg concentrations in Great Salt Lake surface waters were consistent throughout the year (3.6 +/- 0.8 ng L-1 and 0.93 +/- 0.59 ng L-1, respectively), while brine shrimp concentrations had a statistically significant increase from summer to fall. Data collected and data analyses indicated no direct local or regional source of Hg to the lake and that factors within the Great Salt Lake basin are important in controlling Hg-0 and RGM concentrations.

The total bacterial numbers were 5.1x10(5) cells ml(-1) at 1 m and 2.5x10(5) cells ml(-1) at 400 m depth, which are about half and quarter of the numbers of other lakes. The proportion of respiring bacteria was as low as 2.5% at 1 m and 1.4% at 400 m depth. Considering the amount of organic carbon which need to be degraded and low proportion of respiring bacteria, the bacteria could be assumed to have high activities. The EUB/DAPI ratios were 77 and 89% at 1 m and 400 m depths, respectively. Of the bacterial community, the 'other' group was dominant at both depths, and gamma group of proteobacteria followed next.

J	Hutorowicz, A				Hutorowicz, Andrzej			Baseline Water Temperature: Estimation of the Annual Cycle of Surface Water Temperature in Lakes in North-Central Poland over the 1951-1968 Period	WATER												Water temperature is an important ecological variable that affects the functioning of lakes. Unfortunately, for many lakes there are no long-term observations enabling the assessment of changes in water temperatures. This makes it difficult to include this aspect in research into the biology, ecology and chemistry of such lakes. This paper presents a literature review related to changes of surface water temperatures in lakes and in particular describing the response of water temperatures and stratification to changing climate in Polish lakes. On this basis, a model based on the available data on water temperature in 931 Polish lakes in the years 1951-1968 was proposed, which allows to estimate the baseline water temperature on any day of the year. This model is calculated using the complementary error peak function on the 0-3 m water temperature dataset, which provides the best reduction of diurnal temperature fluctuations. It can be an alternative to the average temperature of surface waters, which are calculated on the basis of systematically collected data. Based on the average water temperature data obtained from 56 thermal profiles in 10 lakes in 2010-2019, the equation was analogically calculated. The average monthly water temperatures in June, July, August and September and the change in water temperature (0.24-0.30 degrees C decade(-1)) in the period 1951-1968/2010-2019 were estimated then. Similar regional or single lake trends have been found in studies by other authors covering a similar or longer period of time. The proposed method, which is suitable for simulating temperatures, especially in summer, enables the determination of the value of changes in surface water temperature in Polish lakes when only thermal profiles data from different dates are available, which can be especially helpful when analyzing hydrobiological results.					; Hutorowicz, Andrzej/O-5061-2019	Hutorowicz, Andrzej/0000-0002-2976-1079; 														2073-4441				DEC	2020	12	12							3574	10.3390/w12123574	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12123574													WOS:000602787900001
J	Clarke, GKC				Clarke, GKC			Hydraulics of subglacial outburst floods: new insights from the Spring-Hutter formulation	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												Using a slightly modified form of the Spring-Hutter equations, glacial outburst floods are simulated from three classic sites, "Hazard Lake", Yukon, Canada, Summit Lake, British Columbia, Canada, and Grimsvotn, Iceland, in order to calibrate the hydraulic roughness associated with subglacial conduits. Previous work has suggested that the Manning roughness of the conduits is remarkably high, but the new calibration yields substantially lower values that are representative of those for natural streams and rivers. The discrepancy can be traced to a poor assumption about the effectiveness of heat transfer at the conduit walls. The simulations reveal behaviour that cannot he inferred from simplified theories: (1) During flood onset, water pressure over much of the conduit can exceed the confining pressure of surrounding ice. (2) Local values of fluid potential gradient can differ substantially from the value averaged over the length of the conduit, contradicting an assumption of simple theories. (3) As the flood progresses, the location of flow constrictions that effectively control the flood magnitude can jump rapidly over large distances. (4) Predicted water temperature at the conduit outlet exceeds that suggested by measurements of exit water temperature.																			0022-1430	1727-5652					2003	49	165					299	313		10.3189/172756503781830728	http://dx.doi.org/10.3189/172756503781830728													WOS:000188771200014

Using a 1-D mixing model to assess the potential impact of year-to-year changes in weather on the habitat of vendace (Coregonus albula) in Bassenthwaite Lake, Cumbria	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Bassenthwaite Lake in Cumbria is one of only two English lakes containing a population of vendace (Coregonus albula). The spatial distribution and survival of this fish is strongly influenced by the temperature and oxygen content of the water. In summer, this fish moves into deeper, colder water but avoids areas where the oxygen content is low. 2. In recent years, there has been a dramatic decline in the number of vendace found in the lake, a trend that may have been exacerbated by a succession of warm summers. Bassenthwaite only becomes stably stratified during calm, warm periods when a significant proportion of the deep water becomes anoxic. 3. Here, a one dimensional (1-D) process-based temperature-oxygen model is used to simulate the year-to-year variations in the severity of these 'extreme events'. The model is validated using field measurements acquired in the 1990s and used to predict the range of depths accessible to the vendace. 4. An empirical, weather-driven model is then used to 'hindcast' the mixing characteristics of the lake in the 1980s and estimate the proportion of the habitat lost during warm, calm summers. These simulations show that periods of stable thermal stratification have become increasingly common in recent years. In the 1980s, only one 'extreme event' was identified but four such events were recorded in the 1990s. 5. The results are discussed in relation to the conservation status of the species and the potential effect of climate change on its survival in the English Lake District.

We combined paleovegetation (pollen), stable oxygen isotope (delta O-18(bulk)) and XRF data from the same sedimentary sequence, showing distinct variations during the period from 135 to 110 ka ago leading into and out of full interglacial conditions. The last interglacial plateau, as defined by the presence of thermophilous steppe-forest communities, lasted ca. 13.5 ka, from similar to 129.1-115.6 ka BP. The detailed palynological sequence at Lake Van documents a vegetation succession with several climatic phases: (I) the Pistacia zone (ca. 131.2-129.1 ka BP) indicates summer dryness and mild winter conditions during the initial warming, (II) the Quercus-Ulmus zone (ca. 129.1-1272 ka BP) occurred during warm and humid climate conditions with enhanced evaporation, (III) the Carpinus zone (ca. 1272-124.1 ka BP) suggest increasingly cooler and wetter conditions, and (IV) the expansion of Pinus at similar to 124.1 ka BP marks the onset of a colder/drier environment that extended into the interval of global ice growth. Pollen data suggest migration of thermophilous trees from refugial areas at the beginning of the last interglacial. Analogous to the current interglacial, the migration documents a time lag between the onset of climatic amelioration and the establishment of an oak steppe-forest, spanning 2.1 ka. Hence, the major difference between the last interglacial compared to the current interglacial (Holocene) is the abundance of Pinus as well as the decrease of deciduous broad-leaved trees, indicating higher continentality during the last interglacial. Finally, our results demonstrate intra-interglacial variability in the low mid-latitudes and suggest a close connection with the high-frequency climate variability recorded in Greenland ice cores.

Water Quality Index (WQI), Metal Index (MI), Hazard Quotient (HQ), Hazard Index, and Cancer Risk were calculated in order to evaluate the water quality of these lakes. Correlation analysis revealed that Mn and Fe were derived from natural geological weathering processes and Pb, V, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Cd might have originated from anthropogenic sources. The results revealed that WQI of the remote lake fell into excellent water quality and urban lake fell into poor water quality, which is also supported by the MI calculation. Moreover, the HQ of Mn in urban lake showed values greater than unity suggesting its health risk to the local inhabitants. The cancer index values indicated "high" risk due to Cr, whereas Cd possesses "very low" cancer risk on local population residing nearby areas.

J	Viveen, W; Sanjurjo-Sanchez, J; Rosas, MA; Vanacker, V; Villegas-Lanza, JC				Viveen, Willem; Sanjurjo-Sanchez, Jorge; Rosas, Miluska A.; Vanacker, Veerle; Villegas-Lanza, Juan Carlos			Heinrich events and tectonic uplift as possible drivers for late Quaternary fluvial dynamics in the western Peruvian Andes	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												Late Quaternary fluvial valley development in Peru is considered to be driven by summer insolation maxima in the precession cycle, which coincide with increased precipitation and rising lake levels in the central Andes. Our literature review, however, indicates that fluvial aggradation does not always coincide with summer insolation maxima but may also occur during transitions between insolation maxima and minima or even during summer insolation minima. Tectonic uplift as a driver of fluvial incision has not been considered in the current terrace formation models, despite the Peruvian margin being located above an active subduction zone. We present new chronologic, stratigraphic and geomorphic data of the Canete River valley over the past 102 +/- 6 ka. We mapped its fluvial terraces (11.5 degrees-13 degrees southern latitude) along a 75-km long reach perpendicular to the strike of the Andes. Five fluvial terraces and one floodplain level were identified with relative elevations of up to 181.1 m above the floodplain. Thirty-three (pIR) IRSL ages of eight fluvial terraces and one alluvial fan sediment sample showed that their ages in part correspond to summer insolation maxima of the precession cycle, but that a better match exists with pluvial periods that coincided with Heinrich events of the northern hemisphere and rising lake levels in the Andes. The chronology of terraces of the Canete River agrees with those of previously studied fluvial systems between 7 degrees and 16 degrees southern latitude in Peru, suggesting a regional-scale fluvial response possibly to the Heinrich events. Reconstructed longitudinal profiles and terrace ages were utilised to calculate vertical incision rates. We calculated a mean rate of 1.8 +/- 0.10 mm a(-1) over the last 102 +/- 6 ka, but incision rates varied considerably within this time period possibly in response to changes in the Qs: Qw ratio as a consequence of increased sediment input during the wet Heinrich events. A set of 1338 GNSS measurements of daily, vertical crustal deformation of the years 2009-2015 showed a continuous and positive trend in interseismic, accumulative vertical crustal movements with a time-averaged, crustal uplift rate of 1.9 +/- 3.6 mm a(-1). The positive trend in vertical movements, together with data from literature suggest landscape rejuvenation along the forearc and western Cordillera in central Peru. It is proposed that maximally similar to 0.5 mm a(-1) of the total incision over the past 102 ka may possibly be related to nonrecoverable, interseismic deformation. Climate change-driven variations in the Qs:Qw ratio are superimposed on the long-term tectonic uplift trend, and both are considered the main drivers of fluvial incision.					; Rosas Barturen, Miluska Anthuannet/JRX-9040-2023; Sánchez, Jorge/E-4404-2011	Viveen, Willem/0000-0003-4828-3065; Rosas, Miluska A./0000-0002-3717-0172; 													0921-8181	1872-6364				NOV	2022	218								103972	10.1016/j.gloplacha.2022.103972	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2022.103972		OCT 2022											WOS:000877517300001
J	Ashtine, M; Bello, R; Higuchi, K				Ashtine, Masao; Bello, Richard; Higuchi, Kaz			Feasibility of Small Wind Turbines in Ontario: Integrating Power Curves with Wind Trends	RESOURCES-BASEL												Micro-scale/small wind turbines, unlike larger utility-scale turbines, produce electricity at a rate of 300 W to 10 kW at their rated wind speed and are typically below 30 m in hub-height. These wind turbines have much more flexibility in their costs, maintenance and siting, owing to their size, and can provided wind energy in areas much less suited for direct supply to the grid system. In the future under climate change, the energy landscape will likely shift from the present centralized electricity generation and delivery system to a more distributed and locally-generated electricity and delivery system. In the new system configuration, the role of relatively small sustainable electricity generators like small wind turbines will likely become more prominent. However, the small wind industry has been substantially slow to progress in Ontario, Canada, and there is much debate over its viability in a growing energy dependent economy. This study seeks to demonstrate the performance of a small wind turbine, and speculate on its potential power output and trend over Ontario historically over the last 33 years using the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) data. We assessed the efficiency of a Bergey Excel 1 kW wind turbine at the pre-established Kortright Centre for Conservation test site, located north of Toronto. Using a novel approach, the Bergey optimized power curve was incorporated with reanalysis data to establish power output across Ontario at three-hour resolution. Small turbine-based wind power around the Great Lakes and eastern James Bay increased during winter and fall, contributing up to 10% of the annual electricity demand in some regions in Ontario. We purport that increases in power output are driven by long-term reductions in sea and lake ice concentrations affecting atmospheric stability in surrounding regions.																			2079-9276					DEC	2016	5	4							44	10.3390/resources5040044	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/resources5040044													WOS:000393581900005
J	Wang, JY; Shao, MQ				Wang, Jianying; Shao, Mingqin			Regional differences in wintering habitat selection strategies of Siberian Crane (Leucogeranus leucogeranus) and ecological network construction of key wintering areas	AVIAN RESEARCH												Poyang Lake (PYL) and the Yellow River Delta (YRD) are two critical wintering areas for the Siberian Crane (Leucogeranus leucogeranus) along the East Asian-Australasian Flyway in China. Based on nearly two decades of remote sensing and environmental data, this study used the MaxEnt model to assess wintering habitat suitability in Poyang Lake (PYL) and the Yellow River Delta (YRD). Landscape pattern and ecological network (EN) analyses were integrated to examine habitat changes and their impact on Siberian Crane distribution. In PYL, land use/ land cover (LULC) change was driven primarily by water level fluctuations, leading to transitions among natural habitat types. In contrast, LULC change in YRD was dominated by anthropogenic activities, with widespread conversion of natural habitats into artificial habitats. In both regions, Siberian Cranes favored wetlands that are food-rich, flat, and minimally disturbed. In PYL, ecological sources were mainly found in sub-lakes of nature reserves and nearby moist areas, averaging 87.42 km2. In the YRD, sources were distributed across tidal flats, paddy land, and grasslands, with a larger mean area of 198.37 km2. Mann-Kendall tests showed significant trends in PYL, including increased patch density and decreased EN cumulative resilience. The maximum habitat suitability in the YRD significantly declined. Comparative analysis revealed that PYL had significantly higher habitat suitability and EN cumulative resilience, whereas the YRD had larger but more fragmented habitats. By introducing key stepping-stone nodes to optimize the ENs, the connectivity and resilience of PYL's EN were notably enhanced. Although improvements in the YRD were less marked, the optimization scheme still improved the security of the crane migration network. Based on the findings, it is recommended to implement refined water level management in PYL to maintain the stability of sub-lakes and adjacent wetlands, and to strengthen the protection of natural wetlands in the YRD by limiting the expansion of artificial land use, in order to mitigate habitat fragmentation.																			2053-7166					SEP	2025	16	3							100273	10.1016/j.avrs.2025.100273	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.avrs.2025.100273													WOS:001533955200001

In order to clarify the relationship between temperature and diatom assemblage composition, we focused on a region with significant seasonal changes but without a freezing period. From March 2016 to March 2018, sediment trap samples were collected monthly to monitor the seasonal succession of diatoms in Douhu Lake, in subtropical southeast China. The results show that in 2016 the variations in abundance of Aulacoseira granulata and Aulacoseira ambigua followed an obvious seasonal pattern, corresponding to the seasonal variation in water and air temperature. In 2016, the thermophilic taxon A. granulata was dominant in the warm season, and in the cold season its abundance declined, while that of A. ambigua, a taxon better adapted to cooler conditions, increased relatively. In 2017, however, there was no such typical seasonal variation. In the cold season of 2017, A. granulata did not decline and there was no significant increase in the cold-preferring A. ambigua. This was related to the large drop in the lake level associated with human activity (substantial water extraction) that occurred during the winter of 2017, which disturbed the natural seasonal fluctuation in water temperature. Thus, in 2017, while air temperature followed the regular seasonal cycle, lake water temperature did not decrease significantly in winter, which allowed A. granulata to maintain a relatively high abundance in the cold season. From these results and an extensive survey of the literature, we conclude that water temperature, more than the seasonal succession, directly drives the fluctuation in abundance of these two Aulacoseira species.

Strom Thurmond Lake (Georgia-South Carolina) strongly stratifies during the summer, producing a temperature-dissolved oxygen "squeeze" for landlocked blueback herring Alosa aestivalis. A coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian hybrid (CEL hybrid) model was developed to improve understanding of and better predict the in-reservoir Movements of blueback herring in response to these limiting conditions. An existing application of CE-QUAL-W2, a two-dimensional, laterally averaged water quality and hydrodynamic model, was used to simulate the spatial and temporal dynamics of summer water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and hydraulics. The biological module was parameterized by using mobile hydroacoustic survey data supplemented with species composition data from.-ill-net surveys. The simulation accurately described the longitudinal (r(2) = 0.67) and vertical (r(2) = 0.93) distributions observed for blueback herring. The model results suggest that the longitudinal distribution of blueback herring in summer is best explained by a random term (57%) and horizontal water velocity (43%). The vertical distribution is best explained by the following variables (in order of their importance): water temperature (45%), a random term (44%), dissolved oxygen (6%), horizontal velocity (4%), and vertical velocity (1 %). The integration of fish behavior into a flow and water quality modeling framework can be used to gain insight into the response of coolwater species to flow and water quality patterns. This insight can serve as a foundation for population and bioenergetics modeling or be used to improve the management of coolwater fish and their habitats in dynamic reservoir systems. We recommend that additional data be used to further test and refine the model.

R.; Ward, Carol			When Event Social Sustainability Is Tarnished by Scandal: Long-Term Community Perceptions of the 2002 Winter Olympics Bid Scandal and Legacy	SUSTAINABILITY												Due to the increasing number of events around the world, event sustainability is an area of research relevant across disciplines. Research has found that event sustainability encompasses economic, environmental, and social legacies. However, events may face unforeseen challenges, sometimes even major scandals. How do these scandals impact residents and the sustainable legacy of the mega-event? As a historical case study, we explore social aspects of event sustainability in the wake of the 2002 Winter Olympics bid scandal, where it was reported that the Salt Lake Olympic Committee (SLOC) bribed members of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to secure votes in favor of Salt Lake City hosting the 2002 Winter Olympic. Despite the bribery scandal, the Salt Lake City Games were considered a success by the media and members of the SLOC and IOC. Specifically, the present study investigates local residents' perceptions of the scandal before, during, and after the Olympics using data gathered from 1999 to 2018 in Heber Valley, Utah. We find that time is a significant predictor of residents' feelings toward the scandal. Further, feelings towards the Olympics, community desirability, race, and biological sex are also significant predictors. These findings lead us to conclude that the effects of the scandal on the Olympics' sustainable legacy fade away over time.

J	Solarski, M; Rzetala, M				Solarski, Maksymilian; Rzetala, Mariusz			A Comparison of Model Calculations of Ice Thickness with the Observations on Small Water Bodies in Katowice Upland (Southern Poland)	WATER												Small bodies of water in densely populated areas have not yet been thoroughly studied in terms of their ice cover. Filling the existing research gap related to ice cover occurrence is therefore important for identifying natural processes (e.g., response to climate warming and water oxygenation in winter), and also has socio-economic significance (e.g., reducing the risk of loss of health and life for potential ice cover users). This paper addresses the issue of determining the utility of two simple empirical models based on the accumulated freezing degree-days (AFDD) formula for predicting maximum ice thickness in water bodies. The study covered 11 small anthropogenic water bodies located in the Katowice Upland and consisted of comparing the values obtained from modelling with actual ice thicknesses observed during three winter seasons (2009/2010, 2010/2011, and 2011/2012). The best fit was obtained between the values observed and those calculated using Stefan's formula with an empirical coefficient of 0.014. A poorer fit was obtained for Zubov's formula (with the exception of the 2011/2012 season), which is primarily due to the fact that this model does not account for the thickness of the snow accumulated on the ice cover. Bengst'cise forecasting of the state of the ice cover and the provision of the relevant information to interested users will increase the safety of using such water bodies in climate warming conditions, reducing the number of accidents.

The combined data suggest a drastic lowering of photosynthetic production and perhaps the collapse of the ecosystems of both lakes due to significant environmental changes during the LGM. Both lakes were almost uninhabited during the LGM. Starting from similar to 12,000 to 13,000 C-14 years ago, the planktonic communities redeveloped and primary production increased in both takes. As a result, Holocene sediments contain abundant and well-preserved planktonic/benthic diatoms, stomatocysts, sponge spicules and zooplankton remains. The ecosystem stress in Lake Baikal during glacial time appears to be due to a decrease in nutrient loading from the watershed, lowering of surface water temperature, and very low transparency of water and ice. We believe that endemic species in Baikal survived during glacial ecological catastrophes in refugia that could have been a source of species that invaded and repopulated Baikal after intense and long glacial winters. The ecosystem stress in Lake Hovsgol during glacial time appears to be due primarily to drastic lake level falls, and changes in water chemistry. At the beginning of the Holocene, Lake Hovsgol was reoccupied again by cosmopolitan species probably from surrounding small lakes and rivers. In addition to the LGM results, we also show that Lake Baikal planktonic diatom species diversity during the last 350 ka is closely related to solar insolation fluctuations caused by the 23 and 41 ka cycles of the Earth's precession and obliquity. Our results also indicate that Baikal's planktonic diatom species diversity, as measured by the Shannon-Weiner index, correlates with the oxygen isotope record that represents changes in global ice volume.

C	Cooper, AH		Beck, BF; Herring, JG		Cooper, AH			Natural and induced halite karst geohazards in Great Britain	GEOTECHNICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL APPLICATIONS OF KARST GEOLOGY AND HYDROLOGY					8th Multidisciplinary Conference on Sinkholes and the Engineering and Environmental Impacts of Karsts	APR 01-04, 2001	LOUISVILLE, KY	GeoInst Amer Soc Civil Engineers, PELA, Natl Ground Water Assoc				Halite or rock salt, in Great Britain occurs mainly within Permian and Triassic strata and is affected by natural and artificially induced dissolution, which has produced karstic landforms and subsidence. This natural and artificial salt karst associated with these deposits and the dissolution zone commonly extends down to a depth of between 30 and 130m, in the Triassic strata and up to 300-400m in the Permian rocks. In the Triassic rocks, this salt karst is buried by collapsed and foundered insoluble material that was interbedded with the salt or present in the overlying strata. In the Permian rocks a salt dissolution front is present and the overlying strata has collapsed into a monoclinal structure. In the Triassic areas, salt springs show that dissolution is active and they are associated with linear belts subsidence ponds. The occurrence of these salt springs in Britain is commonly indicated by the of place names ending in "wich", hence the naming of the towns of Northwich, Middlewich, Nantwich in the Cheshire saltfield and Droitwich in the English West Midlands. The salt deposits were exploited from pre-Roman times onwards utilising the brine from the natural springs ("wild" brine extraction). In Victorian times a flourishing salt and chemicals industry developed, but the techniques of uncontrolled wild brine extraction caused severe subsidence problems, the legacy of which is still present. Brine dissolution channels were developed extending many kilometres away from the abstraction points and an artificial salt karst was formed. The salt was also mined, but the mines commonly flooded and if the resultant brine was pumped out ("bastard" brine extraction) it caused catastrophic subsidence and the formation of large ponds and lakes. Legislation was introduced to deal with the problem and a levy is still charged for salt extraction to pay for any damage. Most modern salt extraction is by fairly deep dry mining or deep solution mining leaving large brine-filled cavities. The natural and induced salt karst, plus the mining problems have left a legacy of difficult ground for development. Some salt mines are still collapsing and the re-establishment of the hydrogeological regimes after brine extraction means that salt springs may flow again and cause further dissolution and collapse.

The composite coagulants were tested by jar tests for the effects of mass percents (5%similar to 20%) and intrinsic viscosity values (0.55 similar to 3.99dL/g) of PDM on algae- and turbidity-removal efficiencies. The results show that when the residual turbidity of supernatant after sedimentation reaches the control standard of 2 NTU, the dosages of A-F and A-F/PDM (0.55/5%similar to 3.99/20%) are 4.52 mg/L and 4.27 similar to 2.52 mg/L respectively, and the algae-removal rates are 90.1% and 92.0%similar to 96.3% respectively. When the dosages are 4.52 mg/L, the algae-removal rates are 90.1% and 92.5%similar to 99.0% respectively, and the residual turbidities are 2.00 NTU and 1.76 similar to 0.60 NTU respectively. Therefore, using A-F/PDM composite coagulants can enhance evidently the treatment effect of A-F to Taihu Lake prechlorinated algae-containing water in winter.

However, only a few studies have been performed on submerged macrophytes though they play important roles in shallow lakes. In the present study, six common submerged macrophytes were chosen to investigate the diurnal changes of the maximum potential quantum efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/ Fm) on sunny days in summer. The Fv/Fm values of all these species decreased at midday under natural conditions, but there was no significant change either under the "Shade" treatment or under laboratory conditions. The Fv/Fm values were negatively correlated with photon radiance, except for Ceratophyllum demersum, which probably could support high light as shown by rapid light curves. The decreasing Fv/Fm values during midday known in terrestrial plants to be caused by either down-regulation or photodamage of photosystem II as a response to high irradiances was here also demonstrated for submerged freshwater macrophytes. In Vallisneria denserrulata showed an additional component of circadian rhythm to the midday photoinhibition. Circadian periodicity and the diurnal changes of the photon irradiance should be considered when investigating the chlorophyll fluorescence of submerged macrophytes.

J	Barbiero, RP; Tuchman, ML; Millard, ES				Barbiero, RP; Tuchman, ML; Millard, ES			Post-dreissenid increases in transparency during summer stratification in the offshore waters of Lake Ontario: Is a reduction in whiting events the cause?	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Since the dreissenid invasion of the lower Great Lakes, calcium concentrations in the offshore waters of Lake Ontario have decreased by approximately 4-5 mg/L. This decline has coincided with a three-fold reduction in August turbidity values and nearly a doubling of Secchi depths, presumably due to reduced summer calcite precipitation events in the lake. The reductions in calcium have followed a dramatic reduction in alkalinity in the central and eastern basins of Lake Erie, which provides most of the inflow to Lake Ontario. This reduction in alkalinity in Lake Erie corresponds to a period of rapid dreissenid growth in that lake, strongly suggesting calcium uptake by dreissenid mussels as a causative factor. The mass of calcium resident in the dreissenid population in Lake Erie, estimated from published lake-wide census data, is sufficient to account for the observed decreases in alkalinity. In addition, observed changes in alkalinity in Lake Ontario closely match those expected to result from inflows from Lake Erie, based on mass balance considerations. Considered in sum, our data strongly suggest that calcium uptake by dreissenid mussels in Lake Erie has resulted in decreases in the calcium concentration in Lake Ontario, reducing the frequency and/or intensity of whiting events in the latter lake. We believe this is the first report of an increase in transparency that can be reasonably attributed to a chemical change brought about by Dreissena. These increases in transparency may have very different consequences than those of dreissenid filtration activities. For example, rather than decreasing phytoplankton populations, the improved light climate might increase summer phytoplankton populations, particularly sub-epilimnetic ones.																			0380-1330						2006	32	1					131	141		10.3394/0380-1330(2006)32[131:PIITDS]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3394/0380-1330(2006)32[131:PIITDS]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000236636000012

The diversity of species composition, distribution patterns, the depths of maximum yield, the order of the species [Abramis brama, Blicca bjoerkna, Coregonus lavaretus, Leuciscus leuciscus, Lota lota, Perca fluviatilis and Rutilus rutilus] according to numbers caught, the dominance in different depths, the winter fauna of the littoral and the common form of the special distribution patterns were discussed. The littoralization was understood as a reaction to changes of the milieu (O2 food) with eutrophication.

Relative trends of nutrients compared well with emission reductions, which were much lower for nitrogen compared to phosphorus. Despite the decreasing trends, only 35% of the lakes met the water quality standard for summer mean total-nitrogen of 2.2 mg 1(-1). Based on protection against ecological deterioration or possibilities for recovery of eutrophic lakes, a promising goal is a summer mean total-nitrogen of 1.35 mg 1(-1). However, atmospheric dinitrogen fixation by blue-green algae will occur in lakes with a growth limiting nitrogen concentration when sufficient phosphorus, trace metals and light energy are available. Therefore, a combined lake-specific approach of nitrogen and phosphorus emission reduction and top-down control measures may be the best strategy to combat eutrophication.																			0269-7491	1873-6424					1998	102			1			553	557		10.1016/S0269-7491(98)80083-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0269-7491(98)80083-3													WOS:000077893200079
J	Lin, X; Zhu, CW; Lü, JM				Lin Xiang; Zhu CongWen; Lu JunMei			Decadal change of the East Asian summer monsoon and its related surface temperature in Asia-Pacific during 1880-2004	CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN												The East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) and its related change of surface temperature in the past century were not clearly addressed due to absence of atmospheric reanalysis data before 1948. On the benchmark of station-observed sea level pressure (SLP) in China, we utilized multiple SLP datasets and evaluated their qualities in measuring the SLP-based EASM index (EASMI). It is found that the EASMI based on the SLP of the Hadley center version 2 (HadSLP2) has shown the best performance on the interannual and decadal time scales. Instead of showing a linear weakening trend pointed out by the previous study, the EASMI has likely exhibited the decadal variability, characterized by weakened trends during 1880-1906, 1921-1936, and 1960-2004, and with enhanced trends during 1906-1921 and 1936-1960, respectively. Corresponding to the weakened and enhanced periods of EASMI since the 1920s, the surface air temperature (SAT) index (SATI) averaged in eastern China has likely shown a warming and a cooling trend, respectively. However, the decadal abrupt transitions between the two indices do not occur concurrently, which results in a weak correlation between two indices on the decadal time scale. Further analysis indicates that there are four key regions where the SAT is significantly correlated with the EASMI, suggesting the joint impact of surface temperature in Asia-Pacific on the EASM during 1880-2004. In which, the decadal change of SAT near the Lake Baikal plays an important role in the linear trends of the EASM before and after 1960.																			1001-6538	1861-9541				DEC	2013	58	35					4497	4503		10.1007/s11434-013-5969-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-013-5969-x													WOS:000326943300021
J	PEHRSSON, O				PEHRSSON, O			DUCKLING PRODUCTION OF THE OLDSQUAW IN RELATION TO SPRING WEATHER AND SMALL-RODENT FLUCTUATIONS	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												The duckling production of the Oldsquaw (Clangula hyemalis) was studied between 1969 and 1974 in Torne Lapmark in northern Sweden. The degrees of relationship among various indices of reproductive output, climatic factors, and fluctuations in small rodents were estimated. Total brood and duckling production were calculated. A correlation between first observations of broods and time of arival of spring indicated that the Oldsquaw breeds as early as possible, an adaptation to the utilization of ephemeral lakes. Peaks in duckling production correlated well with peaks in the abundance of small rodents but not as well with climatic variables. Twice as many ducklings were produced during the rodent peak years as during the intervening years, and the densities of the Oldsquaw population were highest the year after these peaks in brood production. The positive correlation between duckling production and population in size in small rodents seems to be analogous to grouse-rodent cycles, and both are best explained by the predator-shift or the alternative prey hypothesis.																			0008-4301	1480-3283				SEP	1986	64	9					1835	1841		10.1139/z86-274	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z86-274													WOS:A1986E605400005

We used a RAD7 (R) Radon-in-air detector equipped with Big Bottle RAD H2O and DRYSTIK accessories (Durridge Co. Inc.). Water samples with different chemical and/or physical conditions, not used as drink waters, are taken from continental thermal groundwaters, springs, lakes, pools and one sub-merged thermal spring. The waters are mostly chlorine to bicarbonate, except of a few sulphate types sampled at the hydrothermal discharge areas of Solfatara and Pisciarelli, central in the caldera. Water temperature and pH values range from 18.1 to 91.3 C and from 2 to 8, respectively. Sampling and measurement of radon in groundwater are complicated by the high volatility of the gas; a method is here proposed. In some of the 20 sites double or triple samples were collected by using different volume polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles, diluting sample with blank water, and modifying flow of pumped wells. We suggest that dilution can be considered when water is i) not enough to fill in the PET, resulting in large head space in the sampler, ii) too hot determining damage of the PET or iii) too saline to clog the Big Bottle System. Dissolved radon concentrations vary from 0.1 +/- 0.1 to 1146 +/- 57 Bq/L with an average value of 152 Bq/L, using the CAPTURE program, the default RAD7 data acquisition program. Similar values in radon concentration are obtained using the method proposed in De Simone et al. (2015) ranging between 0.1 +/- 5.8 and 1286 +/- 98 Bq/L with an average value of 167 Bq/L. The hottest and most acidic sulphate waters refer to a small boiling pool at Pisciarelli hydrothermal discharge area and have nearly zero Rn-222 content. Rn-222 concentrations from this study are mostly below the reference level of 1000 Bq/L recommended for human health protection by the European Commission and the most adopted in the scientific community (Cata tilde o et al., 2022). No correlation has been observed between temperature, pH, major anions and radon content values, nor between rock composition since it is almost homogeneous trachyte at the study sites. Rn-222 levels therefore appear to reflect the local sedimentological, structural or hydrogeological conditions. The levels of Rn-222 here presented are an important background for the scientific community that will intend to define the natural fluctuations of dissolved Rn-222 in relation with seasons, environment, hydrogeology or volcanic dynamics at the geohazardous Campi Flegrei area.

J	Quinlan, R; Smol, JP				Quinlan, R; Smol, JP			Chironomid-based inference models for estimating end-of-summer hypolimnetic oxygen from south-central Ontario shield lakes	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Subfossil chironomid head capsules were sampled from surficial sediments from 86 boreal shield lakes in south-central Ontario, Canada. Lake characteristics ranged from shallow to very deep (> 80 m), ultraoligotrophic to mesotrophic, and with end-of-summer hypolimnetic oxygen conditions ranging from near-saturation to anoxic. 2. Subfossil chironomid assemblages, comprising 44 taxa from 59 lakes, were analysed using multivariate ordination techniques such as redundancy analysis (RDA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Forward selection in RDA and CCA both showed that measures of oxygen, such as end-of-summer volume-weighted hypolimnetic oxygen concentration (VWHO) and bottom oxygen concentration (botO(2)), were the strongest explanatory variables for the chironomid data. Maximum depth and major ion chemistry were also important explanatory variables. 3. Oxygen inference models were developed using partial-least-squares regression (PLS), weighted-averaging partial-least-squares regression (WA-PLS), and weighted averaging regression (WA). Models were developed using both the full 44 taxa assemblage (which included littoral taxa) and using only 15 profundal-type taxa. 4. Cross-validated models (jackknifing) using full-assemblage or profundal-only taxa had similar statistical power (similar root mean squared error of prediction, RMSEP). The best models had moderate predictive power, with an r(jack)(2) as high as 0.56, and an RMSEP as low as 2.15 mg L-1 for [VWHO], and an r(jack)(2) of 0.49 and an RMSEP of 0.24 for log([botO(2)] + 1). 5. Reconstruction of [VWHO] and [botO(2)] using a previously published chironomid profile that showed strong lake response to land-clearance and logging suggests that oxygen inference models are reliable and accurate, reflecting the qualitative changes occurring in subfossil assemblages. However, the profundal-only models may be misleading in situations where the ratio of littoral-to-profundal subfossils changes drastically in response to lake disturbance.					; Smol, John/A-8838-2015	Smol, John/0000-0002-2499-6696; 													0046-5070					NOV	2001	46	11					1529	1551		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2001.00763.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2001.00763.x													WOS:000172341400009

Within a region with common climatic conditions, lake thermal variables should exhibit coherent variability patterns to the extent to which they are not influenced by lake specific features such as morphometry and water clarity. We tested the degree of temporal coherence in interannual variability for climatic variables (air temperature and solar radiation) among four lake districts in the Upper Great Lakes Region. We also tested the degree of coherence of lake thermal variables (near-surface temperature, eplimnetic temperature, hypolimnetic temperature and thermocline depth) for lakes within these districts. 2. Our four lake districts included the Experimental Lakes Area in north-western Ontario, the Dorset Research Centre area north of Toronto, Ontario, the Northern Highland Lake District in northern Wisconsin, and the Yahara Lakes near Madison in southern Wisconsin. Seventeen lakes were analyzed for lake thermal variables dependent on stratification. Another five lakes were added for the analysis of near-surface temperature. 3. The analysis tested whether for monthly and summer means, the climate (air temperature and solar radiation) across the four lake districts was coherent interannually and whether variables which measure the thermal structure of the lakes were coherent interannually among lakes within each lake district and across the four lake districts. 4. Temporal coherence was estimated by the correlation between lake districts for meteorological variables and between lake pairs for lake thermal variables. Mean coherence and the percentage of correlations exceeding the 5% significance level were derived both within and between lake districts for lake thermal variables. 5. Across the four lake districts, summer mean air temperature was highly coherent while summer solar radiation was less coherent. Approximately 60-80% of the interannual variation in mean summer air temperature at a site occurred across the entire region. Less than 45% of the variation in solar radiation occurred across sites. 6. Epilimnetic temperature and the near-surface temperature were highly coherent both within and between lake districts. The coherence of thermocline depth within and between lake districts was weaker. Hypolimnetic temperature was not coherent between lake districts fdr most lake pairs. It was coherent among lakes within some lake districts. 7. The influences of local weather and differences among lakes in water clarity are discussed in the context of differences in levels of coherence among lake thermal variables and among lake pairs for a given variable.

The European spring snail genus Marstoniopsis (Gastropoda: Amnicolidae): Eastward extension likely driven by Pleistocene glaciations	JOURNAL OF NATURAL HISTORY												Although the historical and modern distributional range of the European spring snail genus Marstoniopsis has already been considered in the context of Pleistocene/Holocene glaciations, many details of the eastern limits of these taxa remain uncertain. Also, the taxonomic status of some nominal species commonly attributed to this genus needs to be clarified. In the present study, a literature review of Marstoniopsis and the addition of newly found populations and fossils allow a reconstruction of the geographical and population history of this genus. Results indicate that the majority of the range of Marstoniopsis is inhabited by M. insubrica (Kuster, 1853), though several local endemic taxa probably represent distinct species: M. armoricana (Paladilhe, 1869), M. croatica Schutt, 1974, M. vrbasi Bole et Velkovrh, 1987 and M. graeca (Radoman, 1978). The populations in the middle parts of the Dnieper and Volga rivers mark the south-eastern limit of the distribution of Marstoniopsis. Localities along with the eastern distribution limit of the range in European Russia and Ukraine mostly conform to the configuration of the zone of maximal (Riss-Saale-Dnieper) glaciation. Fossil records from Hungary and Slovakia show that Marstoniopsis inhabited central Europe (where these snails are now absent) at least during the early Holocene. It is here suggested that during the whole Pleistocene and Holocene the historical range of Marstoniopsis pulsated in accordance with the area size occupied by the glaciations. The overall geographic range of these snails includes the basins of rivers flowing into the North, Baltic, Black and Caspian seas. Isolated occurrences in Europe are mainly in closed lakes in mountainous areas of the Alps and the Balkans and are considered as refugia in the southern side of the Alps.

Subsequent surveys through July 1994 have found T. piniperda in six states in the United States and in one Canadian Province in the Great Lakes region. One-meter-long trunk sections were cut from Scotch pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) trees felled from February through July 1993 in a forested site in southern Michigan, laid horizontally, allowed to undergo natural attack by bark beetles and associates, and later dissected. In southern Michigan in 1993, T. piniperda initiated spring flight in late March; the pine engraver [Ips pini (Say)], a native pine bark beetle, initiated spring flight about one month later in late April. Tomicus piniperda attacks (galleries) were found in logs cut during February through May. Attack densities of T. piniperda were highest in February-cut logs, and declined with subsequent felling dates. The highest T. piniperda attack density recorded for an entire log section was 263 attacks/m(2) of bark area on one of the February-cut logs. Ips pini attack densities tended to increase with later felling dates. When I. pini attacked logs that had already been colonized by T. piniperda, I. pini galleries were mostly found on the upper log surface. When I. pini attacked logs with few or no T. piniperda, I. pini galleries were found on all log surfaces. By initiating spring flight several weeks before I. pini, T. piniperda is able to colonize much of the susceptible pine material and thereby may lower I. pini populations.																			0749-8004					JAN	1995	30	1					18	28		10.18474/0749-8004-30.1.18	http://dx.doi.org/10.18474/0749-8004-30.1.18													WOS:A1995QG92200003

Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China, is facing a severe challenge related to eutrophication, which seriously threatens the delivery of the ecosystem service and the safety of drinking water. To address this challenge, Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data for the Poyang Lake Basin (PLB) from May 2013 to December 2020 were used. Since inland water bodies with complex optical characteristics, we developed a semi-analytical algorithm to assess the trophic state of the water based on two cruise field measurements in 2016 and 2019. Combining the semi-analytical trophic level index (TLI) with an atmospheric correction model is the most suitable model for OLI images of the PLB, this model was then applied to Landsat-8 time series observations. The trends of the trophic state of water bodies in PLB were revealed, and the annual, quarterly and monthly percentages of eutrophic water bodies were calculated. Natural and anthropogenic factors were then used to explain the changes in the trophic state of the PLB waters. The main findings are as follows: (1) From the 8-year observation results, it can be seen that the variation of trophic level of water in PLB showed obviously spatial and temporal variations, characterized by higher in the north than in the south and higher in winter than in summer. (2) Temperature promoted the growth of harmful algae and plays an essential role in affecting changes in the trophic level of the water. (3) Changes in the trophic level of water bodies in PLB were mainly affected by human activities. The results of spatial and temporal variation of the trophic level of water and the driving factors in PLB can extend our knowledge of water quality degradation and provide essential references for relevant policy-making institutions.					; Lei, Shaohua/AAJ-9448-2021; Zhang, Runfei/JOK-3965-2023; Li, Jianzhong/IUQ-8438-2023	Li, Yuan/0000-0003-0381-2605; Li, Jianzhong/0009-0008-2075-0219; Xu, Jie/0000-0002-5249-6197; Lei, Shaohua/0000-0002-4138-0850; Chao, Huang/0000-0001-8380-0326; Zheng, Zhubin/0009-0000-7370-1690														2072-4292				MAR	2023	15	6							1618	10.3390/rs15061618	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs15061618													WOS:000957830500001

However, there is controversy about the controlling factors for the different compositions of ostracod shells from various water bodies. In this study, seasonal and interannual variations in daily flux and stable oxygen-carbon isotopic compositions (delta O-18, delta C-13) for two species of ostracod shells (Limnocythere inopinata and Eucypris mareotica) and their controlling factors are discussed, based on ostracod shell samples collected from a time-series sediment trap from July 2010 through September 2012 and from surface sediments in Lake Qinghai, which were correlated with the state-of-the-art sensing data of the lake water. The results show that the daily flux of L. inopinata shells is an order of magnitude higher than that of E. mareotica. The delta O-18 and delta C-13 of both L. inopinata and E. mareotica shells have distinctly interannual and seasonal variations, with species differences. Interannual differences of delta O-18 for the two species of ostracod shells directly reflect the systematic differences of the summer water temperature between 2010 and 2012. We propose that seasonal variations of both delta O-18 and delta C-13 for the two species are affected by the precipitation of authigenic carbonates in microenvironment induced by high water temperature in summers, highlighting their environmental implications in Lake Qinghai.

J	Surdu, CM; Duguay, CR; Prieto, DF				Surdu, Cristina M.; Duguay, Claude R.; Prieto, Diego Fernandez			Evidence of recent changes in the ice regime of lakes in the Canadian High Arctic from spaceborne satellite observations	CRYOSPHERE												Arctic lakes, through their ice cover phenology, are a key indicator of climatic changes that the high-latitude environment is experiencing. In the case of lakes in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA), many of which are ice covered more than 10 months per year, warmer temperatures could result in ice regime shifts. Within the dominant polar-desert environment, small local warmer areas have been identified. These relatively small regions - polar oases - with longer growing seasons and greater biological productivity and diversity are secluded from the surrounding barren polar desert. The ice regimes of 11 lakes located in both polar-desert and polar-oasis environments, with surface areas between 4 and 542aEuro-km(2), many of unknown bathymetry, were documented. In order to investigate the response of ice cover of lakes in the CAA to climate conditions during recent years, a 15-year time series (1997-2011) of RADARSAT-1/2 ScanSAR Wide Swath, ASAR Wide Swath, and Landsat acquisitions were analyzed. Results show that melt onset occurred earlier for all observed lakes. With the exception of Lower Murray Lake, all lakes experienced earlier summer ice minimum and water-clear-of-ice (WCI) dates, with greater changes being observed for polar-oasis lakes (9-24 days earlier WCI dates for lakes located in polar oases and 2-20 days earlier WCI dates for polar-desert lakes). Additionally, results suggest that some lakes may be transitioning from a perennial/multiyear to a seasonal ice regime, with only a few lakes maintaining a multiyear ice cover on occasional years. Aside Lake Hazen and Murray Lakes, which preserved their ice cover during the summer of 2009, no residual ice was observed on any of the other lakes from 2007 to 2011.					; Duguay, Claude/G-5682-2011	Duguay, Claude/0000-0002-1044-5850; 													1994-0416	1994-0424					2016	10	3					941	960		10.5194/tc-10-941-2016	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-941-2016													WOS:000379415500001
J	SHARP, WM				SHARP, WM			A REEVALUATION OF PLANT COMMUNITIES WITHIN THE PHEASANT RANGE IN THE NEBRASKA SANDHILLS	ECOLOGY												A series of drought years occurred in the region from 1931-40 followed by a wet period (1941-1951). Plant communities were investigated in relation to pheasant requirements from 1935 to 1943, and later reevaluated in 1950 and 1951. Grassland communities deteriorated rapidly during the early years of the drought. The denuded spaces were rapidly revegetated by forbs. Lakes and marshes receded drastically, or dried up. The resulting habitat was optimum for pheasant populations. Wet years following 1941 favored the return of native grasses; former dry marshlands were inundated and weed species, producing the bulk of the pheasant food, declined or disappeared. Two severe winters occurred during the 21 year period. Pheasant populations responded quickly following the hard winter of 1935-36, but failed to increase during the 2 years following the rigorous weather of 1948-49. The habitat during the latter years had deteriorated, while following 1936 it was favorable for pheasants.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1953	34	4					771	777		10.2307/1931339	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1931339													WOS:A1953UZ51900011

Adfluvial and fluvial life history variations and migratory patterns of a relict charr, Salvelinus confluentus, stock in west-central Idaho, USA	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Life history strategies and migratory patterns of 71 adult radio-tagged bull trout, Salvelinus confluentus, were studied in the Secesh River watershed within the South Fork Salmon River (SFSR) sub-basin in west-central Idaho, USA during 2003 and 2004. In both years, upstream migrations occurred during late June and early July, migrations into two spawning tributaries during late July and early August, spawning from mid-August through mid-September, and rapid downstream (postspawning) migrations from late August to mid-September. Primary over-wintering areas were Loon Lake, the lower Secesh River (downstream of Loon Creek), and the lower SFSR (downstream of the confluence with the Secesh River). Loon Lake evidently provides sufficient production to allow the adfluvial life history strategy to persist and predominate in the Secesh River, while the fluvial life history strategy was previously found to predominate in the nearby East Fork SFSR. Adfluvial, nonconsecutive-year migrations were the predominant life history strategy. Only seven fish made consecutive-year migrations to Lake Creek; however, only one of these fish, a female, utilised a spawning tributary in both years and showed spawning tributary fidelity. Three consecutive-year migrants and three in-season migrants showed over-wintering site fidelity by returning to Loon Lake in September, 2004. The life history variations observed for bull trout in the Secesh River watershed are similar to those observed for bull trout throughout their range and to those of other charr species worldwide, yet the development of distinct migration patterns demonstrate the adaptability of the species to a range of available habitats.																			0906-6691	1600-0633				JUN	2008	17	2					231	243		10.1111/j.1600-0633.2007.00274.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0633.2007.00274.x													WOS:000255552200004

Like all Cladocera, Bythotrephes and C. (C.) pengoi have periods of parthenogenetic and gamogenetic reproduction with participation of males. Winter eggs are formed in gamogenetic females. The period of parthenogenesis becomes longer in the species from southern water bodies, but that of gamogenesis, in water pools located northward. Newborn parthenogenetic females have a round brood pouch without a point before the second molting. This feature distinguishes these females from other ones in the C. (C.) pengoi population. Cercopagis (Apagis) ossiani, described as an independent species, appears to be a C. (C.) pengoi female hatched from a winter egg. This female has four pairs of claws on the thickened caudal appendage without loop, large size, and the shortened firs pair of thoracic limbs, and maximal fecundity.																			0044-5134					JUL	2004	83	7					776	787																WOS:000223654000002
J	AOKI, I				AOKI, I			HOLOLOGICAL STUDY OF LAKES FROM AN ENTROPY VIEWPOINT - LAKE MENDOTA	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												The monthly entropy fluxes associated with direct, diffuse and reflected solar radiation in Lake Mendota are calculated from the corresponding energy data of the lake. Also, the monthly entropy fluxes associated with infrared radiation, evaporation and sensible heat are estimated. The net entropy flow into the lake becomes negative; that is, the lake absorbs ''negative entropy'' from its surroundings. In this respect, the lake can be regarded as a ''superorganism'', which has ordered structures and functions in it similar to a biological organism. The change of entropy content is computed from the change of heat-storage and the mean temperature of the lake. From the entropy flow and the change of entropy content, the entropy production is calculated. Entropy production is large in summer and small in winter; it oscillates with a period of 1 year. The monthly entropy production (Sprod) is a linear function of the monthly solar energy absorbed by the lake (Esolar): Sprod = a + bEsolar, a = 0.006 MJ m-3 month-1 K-1 and b = 2.29 .times. 10-4 m-1 K-1. The values (a, b) are holistic indices which characterize the lake from an entropy viewpoint. Other indices of similar nature are also introduced. Comparison of these quantities in Lake Mendota (eutrophic) with those in the northern basin of Lake Biwa (oligo-mesotrophic) shows that processes of eutrophication or succession are accompanied by the increased of magnitudes of these indices that are related to entropy production. The increase of entropy production will be an entropy principle in some stage of ecological succession in lakes, and also in other ecological systems. A hypothesis is presented: the whole span of ecological succession consists of three phases: development stage (early stage) in which entropy production increases with time, stationary stage (intermediate stage) in which entropy production is kept constant, and senescent stage (later stage) in which entropy production decreases with time. These trends will be applied to Lotka-Odum''s power and also Hirata-Ulanowicz''s ascendency.																			0304-3800	1872-7026				APR	1989	45	2					81	93		10.1016/0304-3800(89)90085-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3800(89)90085-9													WOS:A1989U850600001

Paleolimnological assessment of ecological integrity and eutrophication history for Lake Tiilaanjarvi (Askola, Finland)	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												In this study, we aim to reconstruct long-term limnoecological development of the clay-turbid Lake Tiilaanjarvi in Askola, southern Finland, using fossil Chironomidae assemblages. The study lake suffers from hypereutrophic conditions and late-winter and end-of-summer anoxia. The retrieved sediment record revealed a succession from oligo-mesotrophic (similar to AD 1940-2000) to eutrophic community (similar to AD 2000-2010) that finally reached hypereutrophic climax community in the most recent sediments. The initial state of the record was characterized by stable ecological conditions, but the biological integrity (community and functional diversity) was completely lost in the upper part of the sediment profile. The number of taxa markedly decreased following the nutrient enrichment and only one taxon (Chironomus plumosus-type), tolerant of temporary anoxia, remained in the surface sample. During the period of available observational data (since AD 1978), variance in midge community composition was mostly explained by limnological factors, namely total phosphorus (TP), whereas the influence of climate was statistically insignificant, thus enabling quantitative midge-based reconstruction of autumnal epilimnetic TP. The midge-based reconstruction showed an identical trend compared to sediment characteristics, which correspond to increased lake productivity and anthropogenic activities in the catchment. The inferred values for the initial state indicated mesotrophic conditions, which are typical for non-disturbed clay-turbid lakes in southern Finland, and a subsequent increase to eutrophic conditions, with hypereutrophic state reached at the top of the core. This development corresponds with the instrumentally monitored development. In addition, when the reconstruction was compared with the instrumental values, the inferences were mostly (75 % of the samples) within the error estimates of the model. The present results provide invaluable information on the limnoecological development of Lake Tiilaanjarvi, and more generally, support the theory that fossil remains of chironomids provide a useful tool for assessments of eutrophication history and biological integrity.

J	Ho, JC; Michalak, AM				Ho, Jeff C.; Michalak, Anna M.			Exploring temperature and precipitation impacts on harmful algal blooms across continental US lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Climate change is expected to impact the severity of harmful algal blooms in lakes and reservoirs through a number of mechanisms related to the influence of warming temperatures and changes to precipitation patterns. Evidence on the prevalence of individual mechanisms is lacking, however, with knowledge of many mechanisms restricted to studies of individual or small subsets of lakes. Here, we leverage over twelve hundred summertime lake observations from across the continental U.S. to explore evidence for the hypothesized risks from climate change attributable to specific mechanisms. Using a statistical model selection approach, we examine associations between temperature and precipitation variables and indicators of total phytoplankton abundance, species dominance, and toxicity. We find evidence in support of the hypotheses that summer temperatures drive total abundance, that the length of the summer drives cyanobacterial abundance, and that increased temperatures may reduce the observed toxicity of blooms in some cases. We find that nutrient concentrations are also likely to be impacted by lake warming, as increased temperatures are robustly associated with increased total phosphorus concentrations. Evidence for the impact of precipitation is mixed, however, as there is evidence to support that increased nutrient runoff from precipitation could support blooms but also that nutrient concentrations could be reduced through greater flushing due to precipitation. While statistical associations are not definitive evidence of formal mechanistic links, the geographic scale of the results is useful for identifying hypothesized mechanisms that are widespread across the continental U.S., and therefore for informing understanding of the influence of climate change.

Objective: The seasonal variation along with the impact of anthropogenic activities, water quality, bacterial community composition and dynamics in the Loktak Lake, the largest freshwater lake of North East India, located in the Indo-Burma hotspot region was assessed during post-monsoon and winter season through metagenome analysis. Methods: Five soil samples were collected during Post-monsoon and winter season from the Loktak Lake that had undergone different anthropogenic impacts. The metagenomic DNA of the soil samples was extracted using commercial metagenomic DNA extraction kits following the manufacturer's instruction. The extracted DNA was used to prepare the NOS library and sequenced in the Illumina MiSeq platform. Results: Metagenomics analysis reveals Proteobacteria as the predominant community followed by Acidobacteria and Actinohacteria. The presence of these groups of bacteria indicates nitrogen fixation, oxidation of iron, sulfur, methane, and source of novel antibiotic candidates. The bacterial members belonging to different groups were involved in various biogeochemical processes, including fixation of carbon and nitrogen, producing streptomycin, gramicidin and perform oxidation of sulfur, sulfide, ammonia, and methane. Conclusion: The outcome of this study provides a valuable dataset representing a seasonal profile across various land use and analysis, targeting at establishing an understanding of how the microbial communities vary across the land use and the role of keystone taxa. The findings may contribute to searches for microbial bio-indicators as biodiversity markers for improving the aquatic ecosystem of the Loktak Lake.

Biomass dynamics of charophyte-dominated submerged macrophyte communities in Myall Lake, NSW, Australia	CHEMISTRY AND ECOLOGY												The dynamics of submerged macrophytes were studied in a large and shallow near-pristine lake in New South Wales, Australia. The objectives were to investigate the seasonal dynamics in biomass of Chara fibrosa, Nitella hyalina and Najas marina both in time and space, and to characterise the underlying relationship between the plant biomass and both the gyttja and water depths. Charophytes were most densely grown in the north-east bays of the lake compared to the north-west bays. Average biomass of Chara fibrosa was highest at the north-east bays of this lake (e.g. 210 g d.w m(-2)) followed by north-west bays (e.g. 148 g d.w/m(2)), South-west bays (e.g. 60 g d.w/m(2)) and lastly central deep area of the lake (e.g. 31 g d./m(2)). A similar trend was displayed by Nitella hyalina biomass where at the north-east bays the biomass was the highest (e.g. 167 g d.w m(-2)) followed by north-west bays (e.g. 128 g d.w/m(2)), south-west bays (e.g. 38 g d.w/m(2)) and central deep area of the lake (e.g. 23 g d.w/m(2)). During the summer season the maximum total biomass of charophytes at Corrigans bay was recorded (e.g. 300 g d.w/m(2)), mostly being dominated by Nitella hyalina. Total biomass of charophyte was reduced during the winter season (e.g. 50 g d.w m(-2)). Najas marina biomass remained low both in time and space except in May at Bibby harbour and Shelly beach where its biomass peaked (e.g. 276 and 175 g d.w m(-2) respectively). Gyttja depth showed a positive relationship with total charophyte biomass (r(2) = 0.70; p < 0.01) and it seemed to favour the growth of charophytes at the expense of other submerged macrophytes, e.g. Myriophyllum sp. and Vallisneria sp. Water depth displayed a negative relationship with total charophyte biomass (r(2) = -0.94; p < 0.01). Both Chara fibrosa and Nitella hyalina correlated positively with gyttja depth (r(Chara-gyttja))(2) = 0.69, r(Nitella-gytja))(2) = 0.65; p < 0.01) negatively with water depth (r(Chara-depth)(2) = -0.94, r(Nitella-depth)(2) = -0.93; p < 0.01). Najas marina correlated positively only with water depth (r(2) = 0.67, p < 0.01).

J	FRANCE, R				FRANCE, R			USE OF SEQUENTIAL SAMPLING OF AMPHIPOD ABUNDANCE TO CLASSIFY THE BIOTIC INTEGRITY OF ACID-SENSITIVE LAKES	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												A sequential sampling program using previously published zoobenthos data is described for ubiquitous, cost-effective biomonitoring of the effects of lake acidification. Spring densities of the littoral amphipod Hyalella azteca are quantitatively sorted into five abundance catagories. An essential step in the a priori definition of decision criteria is the stratification of proportional densities per unit macrophyte biomass in relation to aqueous total phosphorus concentrations. Density rankings were related to lake acidity and to detailed lake-specific information on patterns of Hyalella life history and acid tolerance. Incorporation of Hyalella abundance as a potential metric for the assessment of the biological integrity of acid-sensitive waters is recommended. The temporal integration of transient changes in spring meltwater chemistry is an important rationale for the development of such biomonitoring procedures.						france, robert/0000-0002-9171-8426													0364-152X					MAR-APR	1992	16	2					157	166		10.1007/BF02393821	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02393821													WOS:A1992HF76700003

In the karstic terrains of the External Dinarides water division takes place mainly below the surface, so maps of the spatial distribution of groundwater recharge, created by multi-parameter GIS methods, could be useful as one of the bases for water management. Such maps can be used for assessing the percentage in which the territories of bordering countries participate in recharging the shared aquifer. For the purpose of equitably sharing the karst aquifer on the south western edge of Skadar Lake (shared by Montenegro and Albania), the KARSTLOP method was applied. The method had previously been calibrated according to the nearby catchments of four terrestrial karst springs. The Recharge map obtained for the catchment area of sublacustrine springs allowed assessment according to which 291.7 million m(3) of water infiltrates annually in Montenegrin territory, and 19.2 million m(3) in the Albanian part.

It had a profound influence on the regional ecological environment and human cultural development and was characterized by the rapid onset of aridification in the mid- and low-latitudes regions of the Northern Hemisphere. However, the nature, structure and spatial expression of the 4.2 ka event in the Asian summer monsoon (ASM) region are controversial. We produced a detailed record of regional vegetation change during the interval of 5000-3500 cal yr BP, based on a high-resolution (~10 yr) pollen record from Yazihai Lake, on the margin of the region influenced by the ASM. The results indicate that an interval of climatic aridification, correlative with the 4.2 ka event, occurred during 4340-3880 cal yr BP, with the duration of 460 yr. However, the structure of the event is relatively complex, with arid conditions during 4340-4280 cal yr BP, wetter conditions during 4280-4150 cal yr BP, and arid conditions during 4150-3880 cal yr BP. A comprehensive comparison of the results from Yazihai Lake with existing high-resolution and well-dated paleoclimate records from the ASM region show that the precipitation response to the 4.2 ka event was spatially and temporally synchronous, with a consistent of timing, duration, and structural characteristics in the northern and southwestern parts of the ASM region; whereas the opposite response occurred in the southeastern part, where the precipitation increased. We suggest that the driving mechanism of the 4.2 ka event was related to sea-air interactions in the low-latitude region. Sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies and the variation of the El Nin similar to o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the tropical Pacific region was the main cause, which led to a weaker ASM circulation and a southward shift of the monsoon rainbelt. These changes resulted in decreased monsoonal precipitation and a dry climate in the northern and southwestern parts of the ASM region, but to increased precipitation in the southeastern part.

Over 400 m of andesite lava, agglomerate, and breccia of the Farmer Canyon volcanic section forms the McCullough stratovolcano. Eruptions occurring after 15.2 Ma were lower in volume and are mainly present on the flanks of the McCullough stratovolcano. These include the eruption of (1) the McCullough Pass caldera and outflow tuff (14.1 Ma), (2) Hidden Valley andesite, including 300 m of andesite lavas erupted from local centers (mainly cinder cones), (3) four Sloan volcanoes on the west flank of the McCullough stratovolcano (Mount Ian, Mount Sutor, Center Mountain, and Mount Hanna) (13.1 Ma), and (4) the Henderson dome complex on the northern flank of the McCullough stratovolcano. The volcanic rocks in the McCullough Range are calc-alkaline and vary in composition from rhyolite to basalt. Intermediate compositions (andesite and dacite) prevail, while basalt and rhyolite are rare. The trace-element signature (low Nb, Ti, Zr, and P compared to primitive mantle) is an indication of either a magma source in the continental lithosphere or lithospheric contamination. Rhyolite and dacite probably formed by partial melting of crust, while mafic magmas (basalt and andesite) either originated by melting of lithospheric mantle or reflect asthenospheric magmas contaminated in the lithosphere.

Here, we present a well-dated peat profile with high-resolution charcoal and pollen records to reconstruct the fire and vegetation history in the Sanjiang Plain over the last 6000 yr. The regional and local fire frequencies were reconstructed with the microscopic (<125 mu m) and macroscopic (>125 mu m) charcoal fractions, respectively. During the interval similar to 6.0-4.5 ka BP, both the regional and local fires exhibited much low frequencies responding to the strong summer monsoon. Thereafter, the fire frequencies increased significantly with the decline of the summer monsoon, and the highest frequencies corresponded well with the weak monsoon intervals around 4.0, 2.7, and 0.8 ka BP. As for the local fires, in addition to the climate changes, the local vegetation conditions have also served an important role in driving their occurrences. During the last 300 yr, the gradually increased fire frequencies were attributed to the intensified human activities instead of the climate and vegetation influences. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Effectiveness of a Refuge for Lake Trout in Western Lake Superior I: Empirical Analysis of Past Performance	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												The Gull Island Shoal Refuge was created in 1976 in response to overfishing of the Lake Trout Salvelinus namaycush population in the Apostle Islands region of western Lake Superior. Our objective was to evaluate effectiveness of the refuge by determining whether Lake Trout abundance, growth, maturity, and mortality differed inside and outside the refuge. We compared abundance of wild and stocked fish captured inside and outside the refuge during spring large-mesh gill-net and summer graded-mesh gill-net surveys. We compared growth and mortality during four periods corresponding to four generations of wild Lake Trout, including the last generation that hatched before the refuge was instituted (sampled in 1981-1984) and three generations that were protected by the refuge (sampled in 1985-1992, 1993-2000, and 2001-2010). Maturity of wild fish inside and outside the refuge was compared only for the latter period (2001-2010) because maturity was not assessed earlier. After the refuge was created, wild Lake Trout abundance increased and stocked Lake Trout abundance decreased. Wild adults and juveniles were more abundant inside than outside the refuge, and stocked adults were less abundant inside than outside the refuge. Growth of wild fish did not differ inside versus outside the refuge before 2001, but wild fish grew faster to a shorter asymptotic length inside than outside the refuge during 2001-2010. Wild fish matured at a similar length but an older age inside than outside the refuge during 2001-2010. Survival of wild fish did not differ inside versus outside the refuge before 1993, but mortality was lower inside than outside the refuge during later periods (1993-2000 and 2001-2010). We conclude that the Gull Island Shoal Refuge enhanced the population growth of wild Lake Trout in the Apostle Islands region and should be retained in the future to sustain conditions that favor population growth.

These studies are useful, but by focusing solely on the monetary benefits of conservation, they neglect that conservation often leads to costs for others which may be the very reason for the conflict. In the current study, we combined an assessment of the marginal benefits of conservation with an assessment of its marginal costs and were thus able to derive what economists call the "optimal level of conservation". Our focus was the conflict between ecotourism and farming activities and our case study was the conservation of wintering cranes in the Agamon Park in the Hula Valley, Israel. We estimated the marginal benefits of crane conservation to tourism by using the travel-cost method, and the marginal costs by collecting cost data of guarding the agricultural fields and providing alternative feeding options for the cranes. We found that the optimal number of wintering cranes in the Agamon Park, in terms of net benefits to society, is 40,600. We also found that the entrance fee to the reserve, needed to fund the costs of protection from the cranes, is 6.20 ILS (1.88 USD). Our study may serve as a blueprint for identifying and designing policy solutions, using an economic perspective, to conflicts between ecotourism and farming which exist in many protected areas around the world.

This review describes the most common cyanotoxins and their producing taxa and the potential environmental health risks in marine and freshwaters of Saudi Arabia. The most common genera of toxigenic cyanobacteria detected in Saudi waters included Anabaena/Dolichospermum, Anabaenopsis, Cylindrospermopsis, Lyngbya, Microcystis, and Oscillatoria. The cyanotoxins produced by these taxa and have been detected in Saudi Arabia are microcystins (MCYSTs), cylindrospermopsin (CYN), saxitoxins, and lyngbyatoxin-like toxins. Anatoxin has not been investigated in Saudi Arabia, and extensive research is running for this toxin. Studies have detected microcystins in treated drinking waters, groundwater wells, and hot springs and their accumulation in vegetables and fish. Toxin amounts in these commodities often exceeded the WHO guidance values for safe exposure. This indicates that a human health risk could be occurring upon exposure to such potent toxins. Beyond a comprehensive analysis of cyanotoxins in marine and freshwater environments, this paper also identifies and prioritizes research gaps and suggests future research on cyanotoxins in Saudi Arabia.

The National Center for Atmospheric Research Electra flight between Sylvan Lake, Saskatoon, and Great Falls occurred on August 12, 1993. This provided vertical and horizontal wave number spectra for relative atmospheric density fluctuations along the flight legs. Slopes are -2.5+/-0.1 and -1.3+/-0.1, respectively, for the vertical and one-dimensional horizontal wave number spectra. The radars provided temporal frequency and vertical wave number spectra for the flight mission day and duration (July 15 to August 15) of the campaign, so that the fluxes on August 12 could be related to typical summer values. The slopes of frequency spectra are typically -2.1 (1-6 hours) and -1.0 (10-100 min). Gravity wave (GW) parameters from the two observation systems are compared on August 12, including horizontal anisotropies, and dominant horizontal and vertical scale sizes. In particular, several new analyses are developed to illustrate the synergy that is possible between such systems. The radar winds data, using variance: ovals and a new correlation-vector technique, provide evidence for GW propagation into the NE quadrant. This anisotropy of GW propagation is also shown to be evident in the lidar data. An innovative analysis is applied to the Saskatoon MF radar, using Doppler and angle-of-arrival data, and used to characterize a unique GW event, which is also observed spatially by the lidar when close to Saskatoon.																			2169-897X					MAR 27	1998	103	D6					6455	6465		10.1029/97JD03587	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/97JD03587													WOS:000072737800046

A New Thermal Categorization of Ice-Covered Lakes	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Lakes are traditionally classified based on their thermal regime and trophic status. While this classification adequately captures many lakes, it is not sufficient to understand seasonally ice-covered lakes, the most common lake type on Earth. We describe the inverse thermal stratification in 19 highly varying lakes and derive a model that predicts the temperature profile as a function of wind stress, area, and depth. The results suggest an additional subdivision of seasonally ice-covered lakes to differentiate underice stratification. When ice forms in smaller and deeper lakes, inverse stratification will form with a thin buoyant layer of cold water (near 0 degrees C) below the ice, which remains above a deeper 4 degrees C layer. In contrast, the entire water column can cool to similar to 0 degrees C in larger and shallower lakes. We suggest these alternative conditions for dimictic lakes be termed "cryostratified" and "cryomictic."					; Lottig, Noah/AAE-4650-2020; Weyhenmeyer, Gesa/Y-6135-2019; Laas, Alo/G-7992-2016; Carey, Cayelan/D-4874-2016; Wang, Junbo/IVH-8446-2023	Dugan, Hilary/0000-0003-4674-1149; Pilla, Rachel/0000-0001-9156-9486; Rusak, James/0000-0002-4939-6478; Weyhenmeyer, Gesa/0000-0002-4013-2281; Hrycik, Allison/0000-0002-0870-3398; McMeans, Bailey/0000-0002-9793-6811; Laas, Alo/0000-0002-4801-0377; Austin, Jay/0000-0002-3580-1794; Lottig, Noah/0000-0003-1599-8144; 													0094-8276	1944-8007				FEB 16	2021	48	3							e2020GL091374	10.1029/2020GL091374	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020GL091374													WOS:000620058900003
J	Maizel, AC; Remucal, CK				Maizel, Andrew C.; Remucal, Christina K.			The effect of advanced secondary municipal wastewater treatment on the molecular composition of dissolved organic matter	WATER RESEARCH												There is a growing interest in water reuse and in recovery of nutrients from wastewater. Because many advanced treatment processes are designed to remove organic matter, a better understanding of the composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in wastewater is needed. To that end, we assessed DOM in the Nine Springs Wastewater Treatment Plant in Madison, Wisconsin by UV visible spectroscopy and Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. Samples were collected from the influent and effluent of two different secondary treatment processes and their respective secondary clarifiers, the UV disinfection unit, and an Ostara treatment system, which produces struvite via chemical precipitation. The optical properties reveal that DOM throughout the plant is relatively aliphatic and is low in molecular weight compared to DOM in freshwater systems. Furthermore, the DOM is rich in heteroatoms (e.g., N, S, P, and CI) and its molecular formulas are present in the lipid-, protein-, carbohydrate-, and lignin-like regions of van Krevelen diagrams. Secondary treatment produces DOM that is more aromatic and more complex, as shown by the loss of highly saturated formulas and the increase in the number of CHO, CHON, and CHOP formulas. The two secondary treatment processes produce DOM with distinct molecular compositions, while the secondary clarifiers and UV disinfection unit result in minimal changes in DOM composition. The Ostara process decreases the molecular weight of DOM, but does not otherwise alter its composition. The optical properties agree with trends in the molecular composition of DOM within the main treatment train of the Nine Springs plant. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We estimated late summer open water GHG fluxes in nine hemiboreal lakes in Estonia classified under different lake types according to the European Water Framework Directive (WFD). We also used the WFD typology to provide an improved estimate of the total GHG emission from all Estonian lakes with a gross surface area of 2204 km2 representing 45,227 km2 of hemiboreal landscapes (the territory of Estonia). The results demonstrate largely variable CO2 fluxes among the lake types with most active emissions from Alkalitrophic (Alk), Stratified Alkalitrophic (StratAlk), Dark Soft and with predominant binding in Coastal, Very Large, and Light Soft lakes. The CO2 fluxes correlated strongly with dissolved CO2 saturation (DCO2) values at the surface. Highest CH4 emissions were measured from the Coastal lake type, followed by Light Soft, StratAlk, and Alk types; Coastal, Light Soft, and StratAlk were emitting CH4 partly as bubbles. The only emitter of N2O was the Alk type. We measured weak binding of N2O in Dark Soft and Coastal lakes, while in all other studied lake types, the N2O fluxes were too small to be quantified. Diversely from the common viewpoint of lakes as net sources of both CO2 and CH4, it turns out from our results that at least in late summer, Estonian lakes are net sinks of both CO2 alone and the sum of CO2 and CH4. This is mainly caused by the predominant CO2 sink function of Lake Peipsi forming 3/4 of the total lake area and showing negative net emissions even after considering the Global Warming Potential (GWP) of other GHGs. Still, by converting CH4 data into CO2 equivalents, the combined emission of all Estonian lakes (8 T C day-1) is turned strongly positive: 2720 T CO2 equivalents per day.

J	Abe, M; Miguchi, H; Nakashizuka, T				Abe, M; Miguchi, H; Nakashizuka, T			An interactive effect of simultaneous death of dwarf bamboo, canopy gap, and predatory rodents on beech regeneration	OECOLOGIA												To clarify the interactive effect of the simultaneous death of dwarf bamboo (Sasa kurilensis), forest canopy gap formation, and seed predators on beech (Fagus crenata) regeneration, we analyzed beech demography from seed fall until the end of the first growing season of seedlings in an old-growth forest near Lake Towada, northern Japan. The simultaneous death of S. kurilensis took place in 1995. We established four types of sampling site differing in forest canopy conditions (closed or gap) and Sasa status (dead or alive). Beech seed survival and emergence ratio were both highest in gaps with dead Sasa (gap-dead),because rate of predation was lowest. Seedling survival during the first growing season was also highest in the gap-dead treatment, because of less predation and less damping off. As a result, even though density of seed fall was lowest in the gap-dead treatment, the living seedling density there was highest at the end of the first growing season. Predation, which caused the greatest mortality during the seed and seedling stages, was significantly lower at both sites in gaps and sites with dead Sasa. This was probably due to changes in the behavior of rodents in response to the structure of the forest canopy and undergrowth. Both the death of Sasa and canopy gap formation allowed seedlings to avoid damping off because of the high light availability. The indirect effect of the simultaneous death of Sasa and canopy gap formation in reducing predation contributed more to beech regeneration than their direct effect in increasing light for the seedlings.

J	PATRIARCHE, MH				PATRIARCHE, MH			PRODUCTION AND THEORETICAL EQUILIBRIUM YEILDS FOR BLUEGILL (LEPOMIS MACROCHIRUS) IN 2 MICHIGAN LAKES	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Standing crop, pro-duction, exploitation, and theoretical maximum equilibrium yields were calculated for bluegill populations in Jewett Lake for 4 out of 6 years during the period 1957-1962, and in Lodge Lake for 1957-1958. The computation method for production and equilibrium yields utilized annual spring population estimates from trap-net data and seasonal instantaneous rates of mortality and growth. Fish less than 4.0 in. long (total length) were not included because of limitations of the sampling methods (angling and netting). During this time, spring standing crops of bluegills ranged between 5. 2 and 65. 0 lb. per acre in Jewett Lake; 21. 3 lb. per acre for Lodge Lake. Production of new biomass by the populations ranged from 2. 2 to 29. 8 lb. per acre in Jewett Lake; 7. 3 lb. per acre in Lodge Lake. Production by 4- and 5-year-old bluegills exceeded the weight taken by anglers in most instances, but among older fish yield outweighed production. Total production among these older age groups ranged from 44 to 48% of the standing crop in Jewett Lake, 34% for Lodge Lake. Fishing pressure varied from 70. 5 to 115. 0 hr. per acre on Jewett Lake; 10. 5-52. 9 on Lodge Lake. There was no correlation between size of the spring populations and catch per hr. Exploitation rates, based on percentages of marked fish caught by anglers, ranged from 17. 2-24. 6% for Jewett Lake; 8. 2-26. 1% for Lodge Lake. These values were substantiated by rates computed on the basis of the proportion of available biomass (standing crop + production) harvested by fishermen. There was a significant tendency for anglers to catch or keep only the older individuals in 2 out of the 7 years. The calculations of maximum sustained yield revealed that, with 1 exception, these populations could have supported increases in fishing pressure ranging from 30 to 90% at the observed rates of fishing success. No appreciable change in growth rate would accompany this higher yield, an important condition for these calculations. The harvest from Jewett Lake in 1962 approximated the computed maximum equilibrium yield. It was suggested that the computational methods used in this paper will be useful in solving some of the problems associated with the management of prolific warmwater game fish by providing a rational basis for cropping overabundant populations.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					1968	97	3					242	+		10.1577/1548-8659(1968)97[242:PATEYF]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1968)97[242:PATEYF]2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1968B499600003

Access to the Hudson Bay drainage was provided by drainage from glacial Lake Agassiz through the River Warren, following the course of the present Red and Minnesota rivers. Access to Lake Superior was available through several routes, but most directly by drainage of meltwaters through the valleys of the present Brule and St. Croix rivers. There are no confirmed records of the Mudpuppy in the Mississippi River above St. Anthony Falls. Routes for colonizing that region were temporarily available both early and later during the postglacial period. Finally, whether or not the Mudpuppy occurs above barrier falls in tributaries to Lake Superior's North Shore has a bearing on interpretations of its postglacial dispersal.																			0008-3550					JUL-SEP	1991	105	3					400	402																WOS:A1991HF03500021

Algal assays with Selenastrum capricornutum Printz suggested that the temporal pattern of water fertility differed between the more lentic water bodies and those with more lotic characteristics, probably reflecting differences in nutrient availability. Algal growth rates in the lentic water bodies ranged from .apprx. 0.6 doublings/day in early summer to < 0.2 doublings/day in late summer. In contrast, algal growth rates in the lotic water bodies increased from 0.2-0.3 doublings/day in June to 0.3-0.5 doublings/day in July, and then declined in Aug. to < 0.3 doublings/day. Nutrient enrichments with PO4-P and NO3-N indicated that P was usually the major limiting nutrient in both groups of lakes.

In our study, we reconstructed the historical fire regime of Ne Sextsine, a 5900-ha dry, Douglas fir-dominated forest in the traditional territory of the T'exelc (Williams Lake First Nation) in British Columbia, Canada. Between 1550 and 1982 CE, we found median fire intervals of 18 years at the plot level and 4 years at the study-site level. Ne Sextsine was characterized by an historical mixed-severity fire regime, dominated by frequent, low-severity fires as indicated by fire scars, with infrequent, mixed-severity fires indicated by cohorts. Differentiating low- from mixed-severity plots over time was key to understanding the drivers of the fire regime at Ne Sextsine. Low-severity plots were coincident with areas of highest use by the T'exelc, including winter village sites, summer fishing camps, and travel corridors. The high fire frequency in low-severity plots ceased in the 1870s, following the smallpox epidemic, the forced relocation of Indigenous peoples into small reserves, and the prohibition of Indigenous burning. In contrast, the mixed-severity plots were coincident with areas where forest resources, such as deer or certain berry species, were important. The high fire frequency in the mixed-severity plots continued until the 1920s when industrial-scale grazing and logging began, facilitated by the establishment of a nearby railway. T'exelc oral histories and archeological evidence at Ne Sextsine speak to varied land stewardship, reflected in the spatiotemporal complexity of low- and mixed-severity fire plots. Across Ne Sextsine, 63% of cohorts established and persisted in the absence of fire after colonial impacts beginning in the 1860s, resulting in a dense, homogeneous landscape that no longer supports T'exelc values and is more likely to burn at uncharacteristic high severities. This nuanced understanding of the Indigenous contribution to a mixed-severity fire regime is critical for advancing proactive fire mitigation that is ecoculturally relevant and guided by Indigenous expertise.					; Copes-Gerbitz, Kelsey/AAA-3810-2021	Copes-Gerbitz, Kelsey/0000-0003-0031-6964; Hagerman, Shannon/0000-0002-1830-6126													1051-0761	1939-5582				JAN	2023	33	1							e2736	10.1002/eap.2736	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eap.2736								36104834					WOS:001136626000019

Combining radiocarbon and cosmogenic ages to constrain the timing of the last glacial-interglacial transition in the Uinta Mountains, Utah, USA	GEOLOGY												Twenty lake sediment cores extracted upstream from Last Glacial Maximum terminal moraines constrain the timing of the glacialinterglacial transition in the Uinta Mountains, Utah (USA). The stratigraphy observed in the cores, and accelerator mass spectrometry C-14 dating of inorganic silty clay beneath gyttja, temporally constrain local deglaciation. The majority of basal ages fall within the Bolling-Allerod interval, with strong overlap at ca. 12.7 cal. (calibrated) kyr B.P. This convergence matches regional evidence of rising temperatures, increasing aridity, falling pluvial lake levels, and glacial retreat near the end of the last glacial-interglacial transition. Normalized estimates of glacier terminus retreat and elevation rise in the Uinta Mountains and elsewhere in the Rocky Mountains derived from consideration of cosmogenic ages on terminal moraines consistently average similar to 10%/ k.y. between ca. 20 and 13 ka, implying a regionally uniform climate forcing during deglaciation. Minor variations between these rates likely reflect hypsometric effects during deglaciation. Seven lakes dammed by cirque-floor moraines have basal ages within, or slightly younger than, the Younger Dryas interval, suggesting advances of favorably located cirque glaciers before the glacial-interglacial transition was complete.																			0091-7613	1943-2682				FEB	2017	45	2					171	174		10.1130/G38156.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/G38156.1													WOS:000396124600023

Ellen			Adult movements and spatial distribution differ between hatchery- and natural-origin Lake Trout	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Objective Hatchery rearing can inadvertently alter fish behaviors and reduce the fitness of hatchery-origin fish, sometimes by impacting reproductive success in natural environments. We evaluated the effects of rearing environment (hatchery or natural) on lakewide movements associated with reproduction by comparing the adult distributions of hatchery-origin and natural-origin Lake Trout Salvelinus namaycush in Lake Champlain across three consecutive fall spawning seasons.Methods Sixty-nine hatchery-origin and natural-origin Lake Trout were tracked using acoustic telemetry with 48 passive receivers deployed in Lake Champlain (Vermont and New York states). Spatial overlap of the hatchery- and natural-origin populations was estimated annually as the average proportion of shared time that fish spent at each receiver location. Next, core areas were identified and compared for hatchery- and natural-origin adults, annually, based on receiver locations that accounted for 50% of total residency time. Lakewide distributions were also compared between hatchery- and natural-origin adults based on the duration spent at each location. Last, maximum residence time was compared between stocked and wild fish based on the cumulative residence time that individuals spent at their most occupied location each year.Results Annual spatial overlap of hatchery-origin and natural-origin distributions ranged from 43.8% to 67.1%. Core area receivers often differed between hatchery- and natural-origin adults, and lakewide distributions between these two groups were significantly different during the second and third years of the study. Hatchery-origin adults also spent significantly more time (60% longer duration) at their most occupied sites than natural-origin adults.Conclusions Potential spawning sites occupied by hatchery-origin adult Lake Trout frequently differed from sites occupied by natural-origin adults, and hatchery-origin Lake Trout spent more time at individual locations during the spawning season. The biological significance of these differences requires further evaluation; however, these results suggest that hatchery rearing may affect the movement and distribution of adult Lake Trout in a manner that could impact reproductive success and possibly hinder population recovery efforts. Hatchery rearing can cause hatchery-origin fish to occupy spawning habitats differently than natural-origin individuals in natural systems and may limit the reproductive success and recruitment of their offspring.

Disentangling source of moisture driving glacier dynamics and identification of 8.2 ka event: evidence from pore water isotopes, Western Himalaya	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Two atmospheric circulation patterns, the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) and mid-latitude Westerlies control precipitation and thus glacier variability in the Himalaya. However, the role of the ISM and westerlies in controlling climate and thus past glacier variability in the Himalaya is poorly understood because of the paucity of the ice core records. In this article, we present a new Holocene paleorecord disentangling the presence of the ISM and mid-latitude westerlies and their effect on glacier fluctuations during the Holocene. Our new record is based on high-resolution multi-proxy analyses (delta(18)Oporewater, deuterium-excess, grain size analysis, permeability, and environmental magnetism) of lake sediments retrieved from Chandratal Lake, Western Himalaya. Our study provides new evidence that improves the current understanding of the forcing factor behind glacier advances and retreat in the Western Himalaya and identifies the 8.2 ka cold event using the aforementioned proxies. The results indicate that the ISM dominated precipitation similar to 21% of the time, whereas the mid-latitude westerlies dominated precipitation similar to 79% of the time during the last 11 ka cal BP. This is the first study that portrays the moisture sources by using the above proxies from the Himalayan region as an alternative of ice core records.					; Bakke, Jostein/AAI-1145-2020; AL, Ramanathan/E-7217-2012	KUMAR, OM/0000-0002-2293-6817; AL, Ramanathan/0000-0002-3491-2273; 													2045-2322					SEP 18	2020	10	1							15324	10.1038/s41598-020-71686-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-71686-4								32948802					WOS:000573751100008

Increasing nutrient concentrations and massive blooms of cyanobacteria mainly caused by Limnothrix redekei Van Goer and Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii (Wolsz.) Seenayya et Subba Raju were recently registered. As a consequence Secchi depth was significantly reduced especially during the summer season (minimum: 0.25 m). An investigation including water chemistry, phytoplankton, macrophytes, and sediment was initiated in 1993 and extended to metazooplankton, ciliates and bacteria in 1994. The first half of the year 1994 was characterised by relatively clear water and a high diversity of the phytoplankton composition due to flushing of the lake with water of better quality by the end of 1993. Ciliates and metazooplankton held about 10% of the total biomass of all the investigated trophic levels. The vanishing of the remaining macrophytes enlarged the nutrient supply during summer 1994 and favoured the development of cyanobacteria. The high water temperatures which excluded certain zooplankton species, and the inedibility of the filaments further increased the dominance of cyanobacteria. In November, when the algal bloom finally ceased, the highest bacterial numbers of the investigation period occurred. Thereafter, other algal groups, bacteria and metazooplankton gained more importance. Interactions are possible because of close overlap in space and time due to the turbulent mixed conditions of the water body and the change from the macrophyte dominated to the algal dominated stable state. Planned restoration measures must aim to re-establish the previous macrophyte dominated clear-water stage.					; Dokulil, Martin/J-3464-2019	Pfister, Gerald/0000-0003-4928-6612; Kirschner, Alexander/0000-0002-9797-3073; Dokulil, Martin/0000-0002-6369-1457													0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN 17	1997	342						165	174		10.1023/A:1017098131238	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017098131238													WOS:A1997WZ13900019
J	Anderson, BC; Quartermaine, LK				Anderson, BC; Quartermaine, LK			Tastes and odors in kingston's municipal drinking water: A case study of the problem and appropriate solutions	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												This paper describes a 1995 study conducted in Kingston, Ontario, commissioned by the water utility to quantify the degree of public concern over algae-induced tastes and odors (T/O) in local drinking water. These T/O episodes had been sporadic in the past, but were becoming more frequent as a result of changes occurring in the water source (Lake Ontario). Complaints to the utility had increased an estimated ten-fold from the previous year, due to a long-term T/O episode in the late summer/early fall of 1994. The utility was interested in gathering information both locally and provincially on the impacts and effects of these episodes, which would be used to formulate a strategy for dealing with this problem in future. The results from this study played a key role in this process. From the results of a public opinion survey and a survey of strategies used by other utilities experiencing similar problems, it was concluded that, while the number of complaints increased during these periods, the degree of public concern was not substantial enough to warrant any significant changes in water treatment operations at this time. There was also little desire to increase public spending on water treatment. As well, it appears that the affected consumers were capable of dealing with this problem on an individual basis through use of water filtration pitchers in the home, It was recommended that a public education campaign be instituted by the utility, to better inform the public about these episodes and associated risks as they occurred. Further monitoring of the frequency of occurrence of these episodes was also suggested.																			0380-1330						1998	24	4					859	867		10.1016/S0380-1330(98)70867-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(98)70867-6													WOS:000078691900008

Presence of the Cyanotoxin Microcystin in Arctic Lakes of Southwestern Greenland	TOXINS												Cyanobacteria and their toxins have received significant attention in eutrophic temperate and tropical systems where conspicuous blooms of certain planktonic taxa release toxins into fresh water, threatening its potability and safe use for recreation. Although toxigenic cyanobacteria are not confined to high nutrient environments, bloom-forming species, or planktonic taxa, these other situations are studied les often studied. For example, toxin production in picoplankton and benthic cyanobacteriathe predominant photoautotrophs found in polar lakesis poorly understood. We quantified the occurrence of microcystin (MC, a hepatotoxic cyanotoxin) across 18 Arctic lakes in southwestern Greenland. All of the focal lakes contained detectable levels of MC, with concentrations ranging from 5 ngL(-1) to >400 ngL(-1) during summer, 2013-2015. These concentrations are orders of magnitude lower than many eutrophic systems, yet the median lake MC concentration in Greenland (57 ngL(-1)) was still 6.5 times higher than the median summer MC toxicity observed across 50 New Hampshire lakes between 1998 and 2008 (8.7 ngL(-1)). The presence of cyanotoxins in these Greenlandic lakes demonstrates that high latitude lakes can support toxigenic cyanobacteria, and suggests that we may be underestimating the potential for these systems to develop high levels of cyanotoxins in the future.					; Wood, Zachary/AAH-3650-2020; Cottingham, Kathryn/AAV-3934-2021	Cottingham, Kathryn/0000-0003-3169-5047; Wood, Zachary/0000-0001-7369-9199														2072-6651				SEP	2016	8	9							256	10.3390/toxins8090256	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/toxins8090256								27589801					WOS:000385533100011

Due to the endemic presence of the crustaceous Chirocephalus marchesonii, the Pilato Lake was in the past mainly studied from the biological viewpoint, but hydrogeological information on this groundwater dependent ecosystem is scarce. Furthermore, for investigating the lake drying in the recent 2017, 2019 and 2020 summers, the seasonal lowering of lake levels during 2010, 2012 and 2014-2020 was reconstructed. It resulted that in the preseismic years, the lake emptying was slower than in the post-seismic time. It is then supposed that seismic quaking induced an increase in permeability and, consequently, increased infiltration velocity through the lake sustaining surficial (detrital and glacial) and/or bedrock deposits towards the subsurface. More frequent summer dryings of the lake are then supposed for the next future. The hydrogeological conceptual model of the study area showed that the refilling process of the lake is driven by snow and rain precipitations. The air temperatures during 2017-2020 and their effects on evaporation from lake and on actual evapotranspiration were estimated. The infiltration through sustaining sediments was calculated and the estimation with time of lake wet surface and lake volume variations, and then bulk permeability of sustaining sediments, were evaluated as well.					; La Vigna, Francesco/G-6463-2011	Monti, Gennaro Maria/0000-0003-0136-6904; 													1828-454X						2022	11	1					27	35		10.7343/as-2022-551	http://dx.doi.org/10.7343/as-2022-551													WOS:000782649000004
J	Zhang, GS; Zhang, XX; Hu, XB				Zhang, Guosheng; Zhang, Xiaoxi; Hu, Xuebai			Runoff and soil erosion as affected by plastic mulch patterns in vegetable field at Dianchi lake's catchment, China	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Plastic mulching is an important agricultural practices used to improve crop productivity. Field experiments were conducted to determine the effect of plastic mulch patterns and crop rotations on runoff, erosion and soil physical properties in 2010 and 2011 growing seasons. The experiment was a randomized complete factorial design with two plastic mulch treatments (narrow vs. wide plastic mulch) and two rotation treatments (broccoli-zucchini-winter wheat vs. broccoli-zucchini-fallow). The wide-plastic-mulch treatment significantly (P < 0.05) reduced runoff and soil loss compared to the narrow-plastic-mulch treatment, due to the better developed micro-basins found on the raised beds that enhanced infiltration in wide-plastic-mulch systems. Our results also indicated that inclusion of a winter wheat crop in the vegetable rotation did not alter the extent of runoff and soil loss from the vegetable field. Furthermore, we found that plastic mulch substantially accelerated runoff generation and soil erosion in vegetable seedling stages. There were significant correlations between soil loss and runoff volume (P < 0.01) and rainfall intensity (P < 0.01). The losses of total C, N and P were closely associated with that of the soil loss, and 82% of TC, 57% of TN and 75% of TP is entrained with sediment. After growing season, furrows without plastic mulch displayed lower total porosity and macroporosity (>60 mu m) that impeded infiltration in surface soil (0-5 cm). Higher water stability of soil macro-aggregates >2 mm were observed in plastic mulch ridges relative to the furrows after rain season. The results obtained in this study have practical implications for soil and water conservation in vegetable culture. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We present an updated chronology of the core from DSDDP Hole 5017-1-A, from the Dead Sea's deepest basin, that refines our previous chronology (Torfstein et al. 2015) based on new information. The updated chronology uses the following approaches: (1) radiocarbon ages of Kitagawa et al. (2017); (2) correlation of specific layers in the core with U-Th-dated sediments on the Dead Sea margin, particularly during the interval of glacial Lake Lisan (MIS 2,3,4); (3) tuning of the delta O-18 data of DSDDP core aragonite to the U-Th dated oxygen isotopes of regional cave speleothems; and (4) tuning of the DSDDP aragonite delta O-18 data to summer insolation curves when the cave delta O-18 chronology is less clear. The updated chronology reveals a strong relationship between the sedimentary facies comprising the core and Northern Hemisphere summer insolation variations. It shows that sequences of sediments marking drier/wetter/drier climate conditions in the lake's watershed (e.g., salt/muds/salt, respectively) appear across the flank/peak/flank segments of several summer insolation peaks. In particular, the transition from drier to wetter sedimentary facies during mid-latitude insolation peaks coincides with the intervals of sapropel conditions in the Mediterranean, reflecting enhanced Nile flow due to intense African monsoonal conditions, and marking the impact of the tropical precession cycles on Eastern Mediterranean hydroclimate. This pattern was lost during MIS 2,3,4, when mostly sequences of primary aragonite are punctuated by gypsum precipitation during Heinrich events, marking the strong impact of the North Atlantic on the last glacial Levant hydroclimate.

J	Gustafson, MP				Gustafson, Mark P.			Effects of thermal regime on mayfly assemblages in mountain streams	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The variation in thermal regime and elevation among streams in the Sawtooth Mountains of Idaho, USA was used to test hypotheses about forces structuring larval mayfly assemblages. Sites above and below lakes were included to maximize variation in thermal regime. Forty-five sites were sampled for mayfly larvae and their summer thermal regime was measured. Ordination methods were used to analyze variation in the mayfly assemblages. Principal components analysis showed that mayfly assemblages were strongly and consistently affected by lakes within the stream system, apparently through the effects of lakes on stream temperature. Redundancy analysis explained 51% of the variation in assemblages and identified maximum water temperature and elevation as strong predictors of mayfly assemblages. Elevation influenced assemblage structure independently of summer maximum water temperature, suggesting that air temperature or some other elevation-dependent feature is also important. As predicted by the River Continuum Concept, mayfly diversity increased with increasing maximum daily range in temperature.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2008	605						235	246		10.1007/s10750-008-9357-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-008-9357-5													WOS:000254750900022

Large-scale population trend analysis by integrating migration counts with breeding origin estimates from feather stable isotopes: a case with Warbler (Setophaga striata)	AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY												Large portions of the boreal forest are inaccessible to breeding season surveys, leading to highly uncertain assessments of boreal bird populations. However, systematic monitoring of boreal-breeding bird populations during migration has the potential to inform trend estimates for these species. A network of bird observatories across North America have collected decades of standardized daily counts during fall and spring migration seasons with a goal of monitoring avian population dynamics, but statistical approaches to appropriately weight station-level trends in regional-scale analyses have been lacking. Here, we describe a statistical model that estimates population trends across a species' breeding range by integrating migration count data with estimates of the proportions of migrants coming from separate breeding-ground strata based on stable hydrogen isotopes (delta 2Hf) in feather samples of migrants. We applied this model to Blackpoll Warbler (Setophaga striata), a species of conservation concern, and compared migration-based population trend estimates to those from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS). Migration-based and BBS-derived trend estimates were strongly negative for the portion of the species' boreal breeding range east of the Great Lakes, where our analysis indicated populations have potentially declined by > 40% from 1998 to 2018. In contrast, migration analyses suggested that populations were stable or increasing in western Canada, though BBS suggested those populations likely declined, possibly owing to spatial biases in breeding season surveys in that region. Continental trend estimates depended strongly on the source of relative abundance estimates that were used to re-weight stratum trends at larger scales, emphasizing the critical need for improved breeding abundance estimates throughout the core of the boreal forest. Our approach yields trend estimates that are independent from other breeding season survey programs and can be integrated with breeding survey estimates to provide a weight-of-evidence approach when spatial biases in data collection are a major concern. Application of our method to other species inadequately monitored throughout their life cycle will be an important advance for North American landbird monitoring.

We estimated the effects of the water level fluctuation range on the temporal dissimilarity of the macroinvertebrate community by sampling benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages monthly in 2017 and bimonthly in 2018. Then, we applied a boosted regression trees (BRT) model to quantitatively analyzing the relationship between macroinvertebrate abundance and microhabitat factors in different seasons. To distinguish differences in water level fluctuations at the sample site scale, we proposed a variable, namely, the percentage of water level fluctuation range (PWLFR). The results were as follows. (1) An increased water level fluctuation range would lead to more temporally heterogeneous macroinvertebrate communities. Temporal dissimilarity of macroinvertebrates increased linearly in response to increasing water level fluctuation range. (2) Species abundance presented seasonal characteristics, and the dominant factors affecting species abundance varied with the seasons. PWLFR was the dominant variable explaining macroinvertebrate abundance in summer. Macroinvertebrate abundance showed positive effects with increasing PWLFR. (3) The interaction between chlorophyll a and PWLFR in summer promoted an increase in macroinvertebrate abundance. These findings may provide a basis for the formulation of effective ecological water replenishment management decisions aimed at maintaining the stability of shallow lake ecosystems in arid and semi-arid regions.					wang, xuan/JBJ-6948-2023; Sun, Taolei/AHC-8790-2022; Yang, Zhifeng/AFL-3211-2022															2073-4441				DEC	2021	13	23							3380	10.3390/w13233380	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13233380													WOS:000734719000001

Peipsi was studied with respect to average number per haul, length distribution of fishes in experimental catches, condition factor (according to Fulton) and length-weight relationship in autumn 1993-1995. The relatively good growth rate and condition of pikeperch in the lake indicates that the waterbody is suitable for this fish. However, the length and age distribution of pikeperch in different years as well as the decreasing total number of fishes in catches demonstrate that the population of pikeperch is suppressed due to overfishing during the last years.																			0018-8158					NOV 8	1996	338	1-3					179	183		10.1007/BF00031722	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00031722													WOS:A1996WC58000018

Contamination History of Lead and Other Trace Metals Reconstructed from an Urban Winter Pond in the Eastern Mediterranean Coast (Israel)	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Pollution history of Pb and other trace metals was reconstructed for the first time for the Eastern Mediterranean, from a small urban winter pond (Dora, Netanya), located at the densely populated coastal plain of Israel. An integrated approach including geochemical, sedimentological, and historical analyses was employed to study sediments from the center of the pond. Profiles of metal concentrations (Pb, Zn, V, Ni, Cu, Cr, Co, Cd, and Hg) and Pb isotopic composition denote two main eras of pre- and post-19th century. The deeper sediment is characterized by low concentrations and relatively constant Pb-206/Pb-207 (around 1.20), similar to natural Pb sources, with slight indications of ancient anthropogenic activity. The upper sediment displays an upward increase in trace metal concentrations, with the highest enrichment factor for Pb (18.4). Lead fluxes and isotopic composition point to national/regional petrol-Pb emissions as the major contributor to Pb contamination, overwhelming other potential local and transboundary sources. Traffic-related metals are correlated with Pb, emphasizing the polluting inputs of traffic. The Hg profile, however, implies global pollution rather than local sources.					de Stigter, Hendrik Corstiaan/ABC-8757-2021; de Stigter, Henko/ABC-8757-2021; Levin, Noam/D-2180-2013	de Stigter, Hendrik Corstiaan/0000-0002-4878-6546; 													0013-936X	1520-5851				DEC 2	2014	48	23					13592	13600		10.1021/es500530x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es500530x								25321342					WOS:000345803800005

The processors, named Case II Regional (C2R), boreal (BOR), and eutrophic (EUT), for the associated lake types, have been developed for different types of coastal or inland (Case II) waters. Chlorophyll-a (chl-a), total suspended matter (TSM), absorption of colored dissolved organic matter (alpha(CDOM)(443)), and signal depth (Z(90)) products of the BEAM processors were compared with in situ data. In addition, total absorption (alpha(TOT)) and scattering of TSM (b(TSM)) from different BEAM processors were compared against the results of coastal field campaign measurements. The in situ water quality data consisted of monitoring station data gathered by the Finnish environmental administration during 2006-2009 and data from coastal field campaigns with a flow-through system. AERONET-OC (SeaPRISM) data from the Helsinki Lighthouse station were used to validate the BEAM reflectance products. The comparison with the BEAM processor results and in situ data showed that the bias of the original BEAM algorithms can be decreased through adjustment of the coefficients that relate IOPs such as the absorption of pigments and the scattering of TSM to water quality constituents such as chl-a and turbidity. The TSM products of the BEAM processors can be used to estimate the turbidity measured at monitoring stations with an r(2) of 0.76-0.84 and an RMSE of 0.7-0.85 FNUs (Formazin Nephelometric Units) on the coast of Finland. The best functionality for turbidity estimation was observed with the EUT processor, but the C2R processor also gave a sound performance. The BOR and C2R processors proved to be the best for deriving chl-a concentration. However, the accuracy of chl-a estimations was low with both processors (r(2) ranged from 0.45 to 0.47 and RMSE was between 44 and 45%). Chl-a products, particularly during the phytoplankton bloom seasons of spring and summer, require further development. The Z(90) product from the BOR processor was used to derive an algorithm for Secchi disk depth estimation with r(2) 0.48 and RMSE 0.97 m. The BOR processor was the most successful at CDOM estimation (r(2) 0.6 and RMSE 0.49 1/m), but a simple reflectance ratio was actually able to perform better (r(2) 0.75 and RMSE 0.39 1/m). In many cases, the differences between the outcomes of processors were small and related only to a part of the in situ dataset. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Great Lakes ice classification using satellite C-band SAR multi-polarization data	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The objective of this study is to advance development of algorithms to classify and map ice cover on the Laurentian Great Lakes using satellite C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) multi-polarization data. During the 1997 winter season, shipborne polarimetric backscatter measurements of Great lakes ice types, using the Jet Propulsion laboratory C-band scatterometer, were acquired together with surface-based ice physical characterization measurements and environmental parameters, concurrently with European Remote Sensing Satellite 2 (ERS-2) and RADARSAT-1 SAR data. This fully polarimetric dataset, composed of over 20 variations of different ice types measured at incidence angles from 0 degrees to 60 degrees for all polarizations, was processed and fully calibrated to obtain radar backscatter, establishing a library of signatures for different ice types. Computer analyses of calibrated ERS-2 and RADARSAT ScanSAR images of Great Lakes ice cover using the library in a supervised classification technique indicate that different ice types in the ice cover can be identified and mapped, but that wind speed and direction can cause misclassification of open water as ice based on single frequency, single polarization data. Using RADARSAT-2 quad-pol and ENVISAT ASAR dual-pol data obtained for lake Superior during the 2009 and 2011 winter seasons, algorithms were developed for small incidence angle (<35 degrees) and large incidence angle (>35 degrees) SAR images and applied to map ice and open water. Ice types were subsequently classified using the library of backscatter signatures. Ice-type maps provide important input for environmental management, ice-breaking operations, ice forecasting and modeling, and climate change studies.

J	May, L; Bailey-Watts, AE; Kirika, A				May, L; Bailey-Watts, AE; Kirika, A			The relationship between Trichocerca pusilla (Jennings), Aulacoseira spp. and water temperature in Loch Leven, Scotland, UK	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Loch Leven is a shallow, eutrophic lake in the Scottish lowlands that is famous for its brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) fishery. Studies of planktonic rotifer populations began here in January 1977. Since then, samples have been collected and analysed at more or less weekly intervals. Additional information on the composition and abundance of phytoplankton and crustacean zooplankton species, and on a variety of physical and chemical determinants, has been recorded on each sampling occasion. Long-term datasets, such as that described above, are invaluable for identifying interactions between components of the plankton that only appear for short periods each year, as these interactions would probably be overlooked in data spanning a shorter period of time. This study uses the long-term data from Loch Leven to examine the food and temperature requirements of the summer rotifer species Trichocerca pusilla (Lauterborn). The results suggest that T. pusilla prefers water temperatures above 12 degreesC and that it feeds, primarily, on the filamentous diatom Aulacoseira spp. During the summer months, its abundance was closely related to the availability of this diatom. When filaments of Aulacoseira spp. were abundant, rotifer densities reached 1000-3000 ind. l(-1) and when they were scarce (e.g. 1980, 1997 and 1998) T. pusilla densities also remained low (i.e. less than 100 ind. l(-1)). The reason for the success or failure of Aulacoseira during the summer months each year is unclear but, in general, its abundance was related to the availability of dissolved silica in the water.

The leeches, Erpobdella octoculata, Glossiphonia complattata and Helobdella stagnalis, and their prey were manipulated inside experimental enclosures, matched by controls, erected on the stony shore of an eutrophic, English lake. 2. Five separate manipulations were performed: the addition of tubificid oligochaetes, the addition of snails, the increase in numbers of G. complanata and H. stagnalis, the increase in numbers of E. octoculata, and the reduction in numbers of all three leech species. All invertebrates were sampled, using trays buried in the substratum, in early March, prior to leech reproduction, in July and in late October/early November when breeding had ceased. Leech manipulations were executed immediately after the first sampling of invertebrates, when food addition, at fortnightly intervals, also commenced. 3. The addition of tubificids resulted in significantly greater numbers and biomasses of E. octoculata and H. stagnalis in the experimental compared to the control sites in the autumn sample, i.e. after breeding. The same was true for G. complanata when snails were added. When the numbers of leeches were either decreased or increased, no significant differences in numbers or biomass of the manipulated species were obtained in the autumn. 4. Elevation or readjustment of leech numbers appeared to be achieved through changes in juvenile mortality and to a lesser extent through fecundity. 5. Current results, together with previous findings, provide evidence for food limitation, with a high mortality of recruited young (up to 98%) which is linked to food supply. There is also some evidence for interspecific competition for food, though the occurrence of food refuges, the temporal separation of breeding peaks, and differences in feeding behaviour, involving body size and foraging strategies, between the glossiphoniids reduce the intensity of interactions.

We aimed to understand whether waterbird abundance and species richness during fall migrations were positively influenced by managed lake water levels at 32 shallow lakes over 10 years. We conducted annual waterbird surveys that counted 6 million birds and repeatedly measured several in-lake habitat variables. Lakes with water level management had lower water depths, greater water quality and clarity, more submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), and more wild rice (Zizania palustrisL.) compared to unmanaged lakes. Redundancy analysis and regressions revealed that the waterbird community and several waterbird species were positively correlated to water level management and SAV; however, waterbirds were apparently responding principally to abundant SAV regardless of water depth or management. Two presented case studies of turbid-state lakes also highlighted that water level management rehabilitated lake habitat and waterbird use for a few years. We concluded that water level management can be an effective tool for increasing SAV and migrating waterbirds, but noted that large bird communities can also occur on unmanaged, deeper wetlands with existing SAV coverage of > 80%.

YNP Metagenome Project Steering Co	The YNP metagenome project: environmental parameters responsible for microbial distribution in the Yellowstone geothermal ecosystem	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												The Yellowstone geothermal complex contains over 10,000 diverse geothermal features that host numerous phylogenetically deeply rooted and poorly understood archaea, bacteria, and viruses. Microbial communities in high-temperature environments are generally less diverse than soil, marine, sediment, or lake habitats and therefore offer a tremendous opportunity for studying the structure and function of different model microbial communities using environmental metagenomics. One of the broader goals of this study was to establish linkages among microbial distribution, metabolic potential, and environmental variables. Twenty geochemically distinct geothermal ecosystems representing a broad spectrum of Yellowstone hot-spring environments were used for metagenomic and geochemical analysis and included approximately equal numbers of: (1) phototrophic mats, (2) "filamentous streamer" communities, and (3) archaeal-dominated sediments. The metagenomes were analyzed using a suite of complementary and integrative bioinformatic tools, including phylogenetic and functional analysis of both individual sequence reads and assemblies of predominant phylotypes. This volume identifies major environmental determinants of a large number of thermophilic microbial lineages, many of which have not been fully described in the literature nor previously cultivated to enable functional and genomic analyses. Moreover, protein family abundance comparisons and in-depth analyses of specific genes and metabolic pathways relevant to these hot-spring environments reveal hallmark signatures of metabolic capabilities that parallel the distribution of phylotypes across specific types of geochemical environments.					; Tringe, Susannah/T-9431-2019	Tringe, Susannah/0000-0001-6479-8427; Jay, Zackary/0000-0003-3062-4933														1664-302X				MAY 6	2013	4								67	10.3389/fmicb.2013.00067	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2013.00067								23653623					WOS:000331101500001

The lower Borrowdale Volcanic Group rocks, here included within a single lithostratigraphical unit, the Birker Fell Formation, affords a well-exposed section through a pre-caldera sequence. The Birker Fell Formation is dominated by andesites which comprise 60% of the stratigraphy. Thin sequences of reworked volcanic detritus are commonly interbedded with the andesites; locally there are thicker units of volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks. Interpretation of the stratigraphy and eruptive history of the formation has been aided by the recognition of some distinctive lithological units including: (1) a 200-600 m thick sequence of weakly parallel-bedded basaltic tuffs resting on the pre-volcanic basement, (2) a 200-600 m sequence of single flow unit aa basalts, (3) dacite flows and ignimbrites up to > 1100 m thick in the middle and upper parts of the formation and (4) aphyric to pyroxene-phyric, simple and compound flows of basalt, 50-400 m thick, locally present in the uppermost parts. Analysis of the facies comprising the Birker Fell Formation indicates that it was emplaced as a sub-aerial, plateau-andesite sequence, formed by the coalescence of products erupted from a number of centres or fissures in an extensional, subsiding volcano-tectonic rift zone. Volcano-tectonic faulting and eruption of thick ignimbrites locally influenced development of this field.																			0016-7649					NOV	1992	149		6				889	906		10.1144/gsjgs.149.6.0889	http://dx.doi.org/10.1144/gsjgs.149.6.0889													WOS:A1992KB87300005

A 13,000 year record of environmental magnetic variations in the lake and peat deposits from the Chandra valley, Lahaul: Implications to Holocene monsoonal variability in the NW Himalaya	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												An similar to 13,000 year old record of in situ peat bog and lacustrine sediments from a post glacial lake in the Chandra valley of the Lahaul Himalaya is studied to generate the record of environmental magnetic signatures in response to Indian summer monsoon (ISM) variability in the NW Himalaya. The chronology of studied Chandra Peat Trench (CPT) profile is based on 9 AMS C-14 calibrated dates (cal yr BP). The piece-wise linear regression analysis of age-depth model indicates non-linear sedimentation with higher rates from similar to 4142 cal yr BP to the Present and lower accumulation during similar to 12,880-4142 cal yr BP. The mineral magnetism showed three dominant assemblages of magnetic minerals with varying concentrations in peat-lake sediment sequence i.e. (1) mixed fern- and antiferromagnetic minerals between similar to 12,880 and 11,019 cal yr BP, (2) dominant antiferromagnetic mineralogy from similar to 11,019 to 3172 cal yr BP, and (3) significantly increased concentrations of mixed fern- and antiferromagnetic minerals from similar to 3172 cal yr BP to the Present with characteristically increased ferrimagnetic concentrations after similar to 2032 cal yr BR The characteristic increase in antiferromagnetic mineral concentration accompanied by decreased ferrimagnetic concentration from similar to 10,398 to 5770 cal yr BP suggest possible oxidation of magnetite to hematite under warmer climate conditions and corresponds to increased ISM intensity during early to mid-Holocene warm-wet climate in the NW Himalaya The distinctly increased concentration of antiferromagnetic minerals from similar to 6732 to 5770 cal yr BP indicates mid-Holocene climate optimum (HCO) in the Lahaul Himalaya. The strengthening and weakening of ISM recorded in environmental magnetic signatures during similar to 1260-852 cal yr BP (similar to 690-1098 AD) and between -852 and 239 cal yr BP (similar to 1098-1711 AD) corresponds to Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and Little Ice Age (LIA) events, respectively.

Secondary porosity in the aquifer is from neotectonic fractures and epikarst in the Georgetown and Edwards Formations. The fractures produce an "effective" porosity of similar to 1%. Thin soils allow rapid recharge, as indicated by water-level responses in wells within 24 h of rainfall events. Discharge is generally along second-order streams; topography is the dominant influence on groundwater flow direction. The interbedded clays in the Georgetown Formation create a preferred horizontal to vertical anisotropy. The fractured nature of the aquifer produces local heterogeneity, but regionally, the aquifer acts as a diffuse rather than conduit flow system. Weathering results in a layered flow system with greater effective porosity and permeability in an upper zone compared to the deeper zone. Washita Prairie springs are perennial, with discharges generally <0.05 m(3)/s. The groundwater is calcium bicarbonate facies with total dissolved solids (TDS) <500 mg/L in most springs and shallow-zone wells. Water quality in deeper wells is more variable, as these encounter the deeper flow system with slower circulation and higher TDS. The shallow water table and rapid recharge through fractures allow surface activities to impact water quality, and nitrate levels appear to be elevated above average background values in places. The Washita Prairie segment of the Edwards (Balcones Fault Zone) Aquifer may be able to supply over 50,000,000 m(3) of sustainable water on an annual basis with continued study and proper management.																			0072-1069		978-0-8137-8215-7; 978-0-8137-1215-4				2019	215						131	136		10.1130/2019.1215(10)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/2019.1215(10)	10.1130/MEM215												WOS:000584577300010

According to the daily dynamics of chl a, the bloom occurred in two stages (23 February-25 March and 26 March-28 April). The concentration of SiO2 decreased at different layers of the water column with the development of the bloom. However, the decrease of SiO2 in the layers with high concentration of chl a was more dramatic than in the layers with low concentration of chl a. The concentration of TP was lowest value a few days after the peak of chl a during the first bloom period, and the lowest value of TN was found a few days after the peak of chl a during the second bloom period. Correlative analyses indicated that SiO2 and TP were limiting factors in the first bloom period, and SiO2 and TN were limiting factors in the second bloom period.

Widespread increases in soluble phosphorus concentrations in streams across the transboundary Great Lakes Basin	NATURE GEOSCIENCE												Excess phosphorus from agricultural intensification has contributed to the eutrophication of rivers and lakes worldwide, including the transboundary Laurentian Great Lakes Basin. Algal blooms have surged in the past decade, threatening ecosystems, drinking water supplies and lake-dependent tourism economies in both large lakes (for example, Lake Erie) and smaller water bodies. Whereas previous research has focused mainly on phosphorus loads to Lake Erie, a comprehensive analysis of phosphorus species across the basin is lacking. Here we analyse changes in soluble reactive phosphorus and total phosphorus concentrations in over 370 watersheds across the Great Lakes Basin from 2003 to 2019. We find widespread increases in soluble phosphorus concentrations (83% of watersheds, with 46% showing significant increase), while total phosphorus concentrations are decreasing or non-significant. Utilizing random forest models, we identify small, forested watersheds at higher latitudes as the areas experiencing the largest relative increases in soluble phosphorus concentrations. Furthermore, we find winter temperatures to be a key driver of winter concentration trends. We propose that the increasing soluble phosphorus concentrations across the basin, along with warming temperatures, might be contributing to the increasing frequency and intensity of algal blooms, emphasizing the need for management strategies to prevent further water-quality degradation. Analyses of phosphorus concentrations in more than 370 watersheds of the Great Lakes Basin from 2003 to 2019 suggest widespread increases in soluble reactive phosphorus concentrations, despite often decreasing or non-significant trends in total phosphorus.					; Singh, Nitin/AAO-6026-2020	Singh, Nitin/0000-0002-8495-1908; B.

Understanding the development of wet meadows and contributing environmental factors can provide better support for wetland management. Carex meadows in East Dongting Lake National Nature Reserve (EDLNNR) provide vital wintering ground for thousands of migratory waterbirds, and their ecological functions are under threated due to hydrological alternation. We measured wet meadow expansion in EDLNNR from 1989 to 2014, and explored its responses to hydrological and climatic factors within the generalised additive models (GAM) framework. We found an overall expansion of wet meadows over the study period. However, in contrast to many previous studies, our results showed that water level fluctuations at the hydrologic indicator site had only limited impacts on their development. Instead, sampling year, timing of water level recession, and local rainfall exerted significant effects. The effects of sampling year reflected the changes in sedimentation within Dongting Lake; and effects of timing of water withdrawal might be explained by the life history of the dominant sedge species. Our study suggested that the impacts of large scale hydrological alternation on vegetation may operate indirectly through its effects on sediment balance.

The results presented here show that small riverine salinity increases have a profound effect on the dynamics of the thermal bar, suppressing horizontal propagation of the plume and raising the possibility of a thermal bar which is capable of sinking to great depths. This finding is particularly relevant to Lake Baikal in Siberia, where the vigorous deep-water renewal is still not fully understood. An analysis of the buoyancy forces governing the depth of penetration of the thermal bar plume shows that realistic salinity gradients are an important factor in determining the circulation of Baikal waters. Observations of the saline curtailment of the thermal bar's horizontal propagation also reveal a potential for reduced productivity in the ecosystem of any temperate river delta during the Spring renewal period.

Currently 70,000 people visit the alpine area during the snow-free period each year, and about 21,000 of these take a day-walk to the summit and back. The environmental impacts of summer tourism include: soil compaction and erosion; introduction and spread of weeds; fecal contamination of lakes and creeks; increased feral animals; and vegetation clearance. The principal management responses have been harden ing of tracks; provision of toilets; education, including minimum-impact codes; and restrictions on activities such as camping in the catchment areas of glacial lakes. Currently, only the access tracks and immediate alpine area around the summit of Mt. Kosciuszko receive so many visitors in such a small area. The summit area has become a honeypot focusing tourism and its impacts at one site. Effective management is needed to ensure that the summit along with the rest of the Kosciuszko alpine area remains viable for conservation and outdoor recreation.

Today big populations can be found in many lakes and ponds. Often they occur together with native or other introduced crayfish species. We suppose that A. leptodactylus may displace Astacus astacus and probably also Austrapotamobius torrentium from ponds and lakes, I investigated the life cycle and life history of A. leptodactylus in a pond and a lake (Chatzensee Pond, Lake Ageri) in Switzerland. The two populations were monitored monthly by SCUBA-diving and reproduction, growth and activity characteristics were recorded. The sex ratio in both populations was 1:1. Females had activated glair glands at the end of September. The mating took place in the second half of December at a temperature of 3.5 to 6 OC. The females spawned at the end of December and carried the eggs until the end of May in Chatzensee Pond and until mid June in Lake Ageri. The average incubation time of the eggs was 151 days for the population in Chatzensee Pond and 172 days for the population in Lake Ageri. The size of the smallest mature female was 34 mm carapace length (CL). 100% maturity was found at a size of 43 mm CL in Chatzensee and 46 mm in Lake Ageri. The average number of eggs per female was 173 in Chatzensee and 180 in Lake Ageri and varied between 60 and 400 eggs per female. The egg size varied between 2.34 mm and 3.33 mm with an average egg diameter of 2.77 mm in Chatzensee and 2.76 mm in Lake Ageri. Bigger females had more and bigger eggs. A. leptodactylus was found to be active day and night. Day activity was high during the mating season in December and low in late winter and spring. In May, July and October the crayfish were mainly active during the night. The males moulted in May and the females later after hatching of the juveniles in June (Chatzensee) and at the beginning of July (Lake Ageri). The second main peak of moulting was in September. In their first year juveniles reached an average size of 19.5 mm CL in Chatzensee Pond and 19.8 mm CL in Lake Ageri.																					3-8289-3403-X				1998							430	448																WOS:000168192200035

Geochemistry of contrasting stream types, Taylor Valley, Antarctica	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												The McMurdo Dry Valley region is the largest ice-free area of Antarctica. Ephemeral streams flow here during the austral summer, transporting glacial meltwater to perennially ice-covered, closed basin lakes. The chemistry of 24 Taylor Valley streams was examined over the two-decade period of monitoring from 1993 to 2014, and the geochemical behavior of two streams of contrasting physical and biological character was monitored across the seven weeks of the 2010-2011 flow season. Four species dominate stream solute budgets: HCO3-, Ca2+, Na+, and Cl-, with SO42-, Mg2+, and K+ present in significantly lesser proportions. All streams contain dissolved silica at low concentrations. Across Taylor Valley, streams are characterized by their consistent anionic geochemical fingerprint of HCO3 > Cl > SO4, but there is a split in cation composition between 14 streams with Ca > Na > Mg > K and 10 streams with Na > Ca > Mg > K. Andersen Creek is a first-order proglacial stream representative of the 13 short streams that flow <1.5 km from source to gage. Von Guerard is representative of 11 long streams 2-7 km in length characterized by extensive hyporheic zones. Both streams exhibit a strong daily cycle for solute load, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH, which vary in proportion to discharge. A well-expressed diurnal co-variation of pH with dissolved oxygen is observed for both streams that reflects different types of biological control. The relative consistency of Von Guerard composition over the summer flow season reflects chemostatic regulation, where water in transient storage introduced during times of high streamflow has an extended opportunity for water-sediment interaction, silicate mineral dissolution, and pore-water exchange.

Microbial diversity of an Antarctic subglacial community and high-resolution replicate sampling inform hydrological connectivity in a polar desert	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Antarctic subglacial environments host microbial ecosystems and are proving to be geochemically and biologically diverse. The Taylor Glacier, Antarctica, periodically expels iron-rich brine through a conduit sourced from a deep subglacial aquifer, creating a dramatic red surface feature known as Blood Falls. We used Illumina MiSeq sequencing to describe the core microbiome of this subglacial brine and identified previously undetected but abundant groups including the candidate bacterial phylum Atribacteria and archaeal phylum Pacearchaeota. Our work represents the first microbial characterization of samples collected from within a glacier using a melt probe, and the only Antarctic subglacial aquatic environment that, to date, has been sampled twice. A comparative analysis showed the brine community to be stable at the operational taxonomic unit level of 99% identity over a decade. Higher resolution sequencing enabled deconvolution of the microbiome of subglacial brine from mixtures of materials collected at the glacier surface. Diversity patterns between this brine and samples from the surrounding landscape provide insight into the hydrological connectivity of subglacial fluids to the surface polar desert environment. Understanding subice brines collected on the surfaces of thick ice covers has implications for analyses of expelled materials that may be sampled on icy extraterrestrial worlds.					; Kowalski, Julia/LZE-7177-2025; Tulaczyk, Slawek/O-7375-2018; Dachwald, Bernd/K-6552-2019	Pettit, Erin Christine/0000-0002-6765-9841; Campen, Richard/0000-0002-9467-9100; Welch, Kathleen/0000-0003-1028-3086; Tulaczyk, Slawek/0000-0002-9711-4332; Dachwald, Bernd/0000-0001-8765-8339													1462-2912	1462-2920				JUL	2019	21	7					2290	2306		10.1111/1462-2920.14607	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.14607								30927377					WOS:000474294900007

The effect of periphyton on the light environment and production of Potamogeton perfoliatus L. in the mesotrophic basin of Lake Balaton	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Light within the littoral zone affects the productivity and interaction between periphyton and its macrophyte substrate. The effect of periphyton on macrophyte photosynthesis, seasonal variation and vertical distribution of periphyton on artificial substrates (plastic strips), and the effect of periphyton on the light environment was studied in Lake Balaton. Data showed that an average of 4.1 +/- A 0.4 mg (dry weight) cm(-2) of periphyton had accumulated on the plastic strips after 8.8 +/- A 0.4 days. This biomass corresponded to 294 +/- A 30 mu g m(-2) chl-a of epiphytic algae and blocked 92.3 +/- A 0.8 % of the depth specific radiation. Seasonal variation and specific vertical distribution of periphyton were observed. The most active time of periphyton accumulation corresponded to spring up until mid-June. Later in the year, the amount of periphyton significantly decreased. The optimal conditions for periphyton accumulation were at 30-40 cm depth. Most of the light reaching the adaxial leaf surface was attenuated by periphyton, decreasing the production of Potamogeton perfoliatus by 60-80 %. This increased the importance of backscattered light that corresponded to 10-15 % of the macrophyte production. A smaller part of the periphyton consisted of precipitated inorganic material, while epiphytic algae, making up the majority of the periphyton, were connected to both benthic (dominantly benthic penales) and pelagic (very close seasonal dynamics of pelagic and epiphytic biomass) algae. Periphyton affects macrophyte production especially in spring and in the upper water layers even in a mesotrophic water body. This increases the importance of the light absorbed through the abaxial side of the leaf and confirm the role of periphyton in transition from clear to turbid water states.

While quartz optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) remains the most widely used dating method for reconstructing paleolake levels across the TP, its reliability at specific lakes has recently been questioned due to the high contribution of medium component and low sensitivity and stability, prompting a critical re-evaluation of paleolake chronologies. Here, we determined the ages of thirteen mega-lakes in the CSTP by dating the highest (or near-highest) paleo-shorelines using both quartz single-aliquot OSL and K-feldspar single-grain (SG) post-infrared infrared stimulated luminescence (pIRIR) techniques. Dimensions and water storage changes of these mega-lakes were reconstructed. Our results indicate that quartz OSL signals exhibit thermal instability, resulting in age underestimations, particularly for samples older than similar to 40 ka, potentially explaining previous MIS 3-restricted paleolake chronologies. By contrast, K-feldspar SG-pIRIR dating provided robust age constraints, revealing that the mega-lakes primarily formed during the last deglaciation-early Holocene (17-15 ka and 12-7 ka), while a subset of lakes record MIS 5 mega-lake phases (106.7-97.6 ka and similar to 70 ka). We hypothesize that enhanced Indian summer monsoon intensity coupled with increased glacial meltwater drove mega-lake formations during MIS 5 and the early Holocene, whereas the last deglacial mega-lakes may reflect meltwater flux variations.

Recent studies have shown that ecologically important traits can evolve rapidly in response to environmental changes, resulting in eco-evolutionary dynamics with consequences for population and community dynamics. Evidence for seasonal effects on intraspecific variation is still scarce and understanding eco-evolutionary dynamics in the presence of seasonal fluctuations remains a major challenge. Following the phytoplankton spring bloom in Lake Constance, we investigated how seasonal changes influence the intraspecific diversity of Asterionella formosa both at genotypic and phenotypic levels. We found a moderate degree of genetic and phenotypic differentiation characterizing the Asterionella population, explained by a clustering of the isolates into early and late spring according to lake thermal stratification. Yet, most traits related to environmental parameters as well as fitness in different seasonal environments did not show a clear response to seasonality (i.e., temperature and nutrients). The changes in genetic patterns observed after a peak in parasite relative abundance suggested that seasonal changes in biotic interactions (i.e., parasitic chytrids) might be an important driver of the observed seasonal shift in Asterionella genotypes. Our results highlight the importance of studying eco-evolutionary processes for understanding variations in population and community dynamics in response to seasonal environmental fluctuations.

Bottom sediments and pore waters near a hydrothermal vent in Lake Baikal (Frolikha Bay)	RUSSIAN GEOLOGY AND GEOPHYSICS												We discuss the redox environments and the compositions of bottom sediments and sedimentary pore waters in the region of a hydrothermal vent in Frolikha Bay, Lake Baikal. According to our results, the submarine vent and its companion nearby spring on land originate from a common source. The most convincing evidence for their relation comes from the proximity of stable oxygen and hydrogen isotope compositions in pore waters and in the spring water. The isotope composition indicates a meteoric origin of pore waters, but their major- and minor-element chemistry bears imprint of deep water which may seep through permeable faulted crust. Although pore waters near the submarine vent have a specific enrichment in major and minor constituents, hydrothermal discharge at the Baikal bottom causes a minor impact on the lake water chemistry, unlike the case of freshwater geothermal lakes in the East-African Rift and North America.

Applications of this proxy must be grounded by studies of the modern controls on delta D-wax, including the ecophysiological controls on isotope fractionation at both the plant and landscape scales. Several calibration studies suggest a considerably smaller apparent fractionation between source water and waxes (epsilon(app)) at high latitudes relative to temperate or tropical locations, with major implications for paleoclimatic interpretations of sedimentary delta D-wax. Here we investigate apparent fractionation in the Arctic by tracing the isotopic composition of leaf waxes from production in modern plants to deposition in lake sediments using isotopic observations of precipitation, soil and plant waters, living leaf waxes, and waxes in sediment traps in the Brooks Range foothills of northern Alaska. We also analyze a lake surface sediment transect to compare present-day vegetation assemblages to epsilon(app) at the watershed scale. Source water and epsilon(app) were determined for live specimens of Eriophorum vaginatum (cottongrass) and Betula nana (dwarf birch), two dominant tundra plants in the Brooks Range foothills. The delta D of these plants' xylem water closely tracks that of surface soil water, and reflects a summer-biased precipitation source. Leaf water is enriched by 23 +/- 15% relative to xylem water for E. vaginatum and by 41 +/- 19% for B. nana. Evapotranspiration modeling indicates that this leaf water enrichment is consistent with the evaporative enrichment expected under the climate conditions of northern Alaska, and that 24-h photosynthesis does not cause excessive leaf water isotope enrichment. The epsilon(app) determined for our study species average -89 +/- 14% and -106 +/- 16% for B. nana n-alkanes and n-acids, respectively, and -182 +/- 10% and -154 +/- 26% for E. vaginatum n-alkanes and n-acids, which are similar to the epsilon(app) of related species in temperate and tropical regions, indicating that apparent fractionation is similar in Arctic relative to other regions, and there is no reduced fractionation in the Arctic. Sediment trap data suggest that waxes are primarily transported into lakes from local (watershed-scale) sources by overland flow during the spring freshet, and so delta D-wax within lakes depends on watershed-scale differences in water isotope compositions and in plant ecophysiology. As such, the large difference between our study species suggests that the relative abundance of graminoids and shrubs is potentially an important control on delta D-wax in lake sediments. These inferences are supported by delta D-wax data from surface sediments of 24 lakes where epsilon(app), relative to delta D-xylem, averages -128 + 13% and -130 +/- 8% for n-acids and n-alkanes, respectively, and co-varies with vegetation type across watersheds. These new determinations of plant source water seasonality and epsilon(app) for the Arctic will improve the delta D-wax paleoclimate proxy at high latitudes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Sources and fate of nitrate in the Illinois River Basin, Illinois	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												We conducted a two-year investigation into the sources and fate of nitrate (NO3-) in the Illinois River from the Chicago area to the river's confluence with the Mississippi River. Samples from waterways in the Chicago area (Des Plaines River and the Sanitary and Ship Canal) had relatively high concentrations of nitrogen (N) species and NO3- isotopic compositions indicative of treated wastewater (TWW). Downstream of the Brandon Road Lock and Dam, NO3- in tributaries discharging to the Illinois River primarily comes from tiles draining row crops. Nitrate isotopic signatures from these tributaries as well as drain tiles were indicative of synthetic fertilizer and/or soil organic matter (SOM) at various stages of denitrification. Nitrate-N concentrations generally decreased in the Illinois River with distance from the Chicago area primarily due to dilution. The decrease in NO3-N concentrations was especially conspicuous during the summer, when there is minimal discharge from drain tiles and NO3-N concentrations in the tributaries were tow. In August 2005, when conditions were very dry, NO3-N concentrations decreased from 7.4 mg/L in the Chicago area to less than 1 mg/L near where the Illinois River discharges to the Mississippi River. The isotopic composition of NO3- in water samples from the Illinois River were a mixture of three end members: (1) fertilizer and/or SOM in drain tile water, typically showing the least amount of denitrification, (2) fertilizer and/or SOM in deeper ground water, showing the highest degree of denitrification, and (3) TWW. There was seasonal variability, depending on the volume of water flowing in the Illinois River. During high flow periods, river water samples plotted closest to those of tile drain samples; during low flow periods, a greater influence of TWW was observed in the isotopic composition. A subset of summer samples from the Chicago waterways had isotopic values plotting near and within the domain that characterizes manure and sewage. Nitrate in the Chicago area is primarily derived from TWW, with its isotopic signature evident downstream at least as far as Pekin during most of the year and all the way to the Mississippi River during periods of low flow. Denitrification occurs predominantly in groundwater between and away from drain tiles, although there is evidence that in-stream denitrification and/or biological uptake of NO3- occurs in the Peoria Lake reach of the Illinois River, at least during periods of tow flow in the summer. We calculated that the river was losing about half of its NO3-N load in Peoria Lake in August 2005 (a period of very low flow), at a rate of about 7500 kg/day.

S) urban lake	REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL												Background: During the last decades the frequency and global distribution of toxic cyanobacteria blooms has increased globally, which has been attributed to the eutrophication and climate change. In Chile there have been reports on blooms in aquatic ecosystem in localities with high density population and on the presence of five congeners of microcystins but only two documented toxics blooms with hundreds fish kills. We investigated the presence of toxic cyanobacteria blooms in the Lo Galindo urban lake, Concepcion city, and the environmental factors that influence the abundance of cyanobacteria and microcystins concentration. Lo Galindo Lake, is used for various recreational and eventually as a drinking water source. Results: Toxic blooms of Microcystis aeruginosa are developed in Lo Galindo lake, those that occur throughout the year in a wide range of environmental conditions, forming scums blooms during summer and dispersive blooms in all seasons. There are different microcystin congeners, the most frequent congener was MC-RR (21 %) and the highest concentration corresponded to 115.4 mu g L-1 MC-LR. Conclusions: The dominance and development of the M. aeruginosa blooms in the lake is determined by various environmental factors such as temperature, nutrients, diversity of taxa and wind speed that affect the formation of disperse-type blooms and/or scums; the latter are developed only in summer, coinciding with the highest temperature and concentrations of total microcystins. In the lake the microcystin and different types of congener is highly variable, so special care is recommended to use lake water for consumption and for recreational activities. The emergence and persistence of Microcystis blooms in this body of water are considered a potential health risk for the inhabitants of the area, considering the proximity and the system use by the inhabitants.

Naturalized flow regime of the regulated Peace River, Canada, during the spring breakup of the ice cover	COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD) in northern Alberta is one of the world's largest inland freshwater deltas, home to many species of fish, mammals, and birds. Coincident with regulation that commenced in 1968, the PAD has experienced prolonged dry periods in-between floods, accompanied by reduction in the area covered by lakes and ponds that provide habitat for aquatic life. This likely resulted from reduced frequency of formation of major spring ice jams, which are the only mechanism for replenishing the higher-elevation, or "perched", basins of the PAD. The inundation effectiveness of ice jams depends on the magnitude of the prevailing river flow, but it has not been possible so far to assess whether regulation has had a positive or negative effect on breakup flows. Using a comprehensive BC Hydro data set, containing river inflows up to the W.A.C. Bennet Dam, "naturalized" breakup flows are computed; these are flows that would have occurred under natural flow conditions and are tabulated for each year of the study period (1972-2016). The rigour and utility of the adopted "lagged-flow" methodology are demonstrated via basic hydrodynamic principles and comparisons with independently generated numerical-modelling data for an early portion of the regulation period. Though there can be significant differences between naturalized and regulated flows in individual years, average flow during the first week of May, the typical time when major ice jams form, has not been affected by regulation. During the last week of April and the second week of May, regulation has respectively had a positive and negative effect on average flow. Naturalized flows exhibit practically no temporal trend in the study period (1972-2016), while regulated flows exhibit decreasing, but not statistically significant (P-value > 0.05), trends. It is shown further that the time when the regulated spring outflow begins to be curtailed can be a key factor in Peace River flow conditions near the PAD.																			0165-232X	1872-7441				APR	2020	172								103005	10.1016/j.coldregions.2020.103005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.coldregions.2020.103005													WOS:000519301800011

Sinninghe			A progressively wetter climate in southern East Africa over the past 1.3 million years	NATURE												African climate is generally considered to have evolved towards progressively drier conditions over the past few million years, with increased variability as glacial-interglacial change intensified worldwide(1-3). Palaeoclimate records derived mainly from northern Africa exhibit a 100,000-year (eccentricity) cycle overprinted on a pronounced 20,000-year (precession) beat, driven by orbital forcing of summer insolation, global ice volume and long-lived atmospheric greenhouse gases(4). Here we present a 1.3-million-year-long climate history from the Lake Malawi basin (10 degrees-14 degrees S in eastern Africa), which displays strong 100,000-year (eccentricity) cycles of temperature and rainfall following the Mid-Pleistocene Transition around 900,000 years ago. Interglacial periods were relatively warm and moist, while ice ages were cool and dry. The Malawi record shows limited evidence for precessional variability, which we attribute to the opposing effects of austral summer insolation and the temporal/spatial pattern of sea surface temperature in the Indian Ocean. The temperature history of the Malawi basin, at least for the past 500,000 years, strongly resembles past changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide and terrigenous dust flux in the tropical Pacific Ocean, but not in global ice volume. Climate in this sector of eastern Africa (unlike northern Africa) evolved from a predominantly arid environment with high-frequency variability to generally wetter conditions with more prolonged wet and dry intervals.					; Berke, Melissa/H-3819-2016; Johnson, Thomas/C-1423-2010; Contreras, Sergio/I-1858-2014; Schouten, Stefan/P-4380-2016; Damste, Jaap/F-6128-2011; Sinninghe Damste, Jaap/F-6128-2011	Abbott, April/0000-0001-6694-3675; Johnson, Thomas/0000-0003-4630-6788; Contreras, Sergio/0000-0001-7192-6810; Werne, Josef/0000-0002-7019-6024; Berke, Melissa/0000-0003-4810-3773; Sinninghe Damste, Jaap/0000-0002-8683-1854; Brown, Erik T/0000-0001-7154-2729													0028-0836	1476-4687				SEP 8	2016	537	7619					220	+		10.1038/nature19065	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature19065								27509851					WOS:000382539100045
J	Paul, P; Patil, JS; Anil, AC				Paul, Pranoy; Patil, Jagadish S.; Anil, Arga Chandrashekar			Variability in phytoplankton shape dominance in marine pelagic systems: prevalence of different adaptive strategies in the eastern Arabian Sea during the winter monsoon	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Phytoplankton communities from pelagic systems were assessed to explore the potential of using commonly used traits (such as cell geometry and taxa) as ecological function indicators from the data generated during the winter monsoon in the eastern Arabian Sea (AS). Altogether, data from two oceanic, i.e., convective mixing influenced non-oligotrophic northeastern-AS (NEAS-O) and Rossby wave-influenced oligotrophic southeastern-AS (SEAS-O) and one coastal (NEAS-C) cruises were utilized to decipher the ecological inferences. Overall phytoplankton shapes showed a high level of redundancy by selecting only a few dominant shapes (5 of 22 shapes), though taxonomic diversity was rich (164 species). The taxonomic and morphological approach adopted revealed high species and shape diversity in NEAS-O than in high-abundance NEAS-C and low-abundance SEAS-O. Also, the shape diversity and dominant shapes (cylinder, elliptic-prism, and prism-on-parallelogram) remained the same in oceans than NEAS-C where combined (cylinder + 2 half-sphere) and simple (elliptic-prism) shapes dominated. Additionally, the Rossby-wave front and its reminiscence in SEAS-O and sea-surface-temperature fronts in NEAS-C favored simple and combine shaped phytoplankton, respectively. The morphological properties assessment revealed that the dominant shapes adapted the strategy to conserve the optimal surface-to-volume ratio (S:V) irrespective of changes in greatest-axial-linear-dimension (GALD) in NEAS-O and SEAS-O but not in NEAS-C. However, the dominant shapes in the NEAS-O and SEAS-O opted for high S:V with low GALD and low S:V with high GALD, respectively, while high S:V with no relation with GALD in NEAS-C suggests the prevalence of different adaptive strategies to cope with the respective hydrographic conditions, particularly nutrient availability.					; Anil, Arga/OBN-9230-2025; Paul, Pranoy/NIV-0995-2025	Paul, Pranoy/0000-0002-8234-0484; 													0167-6369	1573-2959				APR	2023	195	4							528	10.1007/s10661-023-11062-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-023-11062-7								37000347					WOS:000961650100002
J	Liu, AB; Chen, YT; Cheng, X				Liu, Aobo; Chen, Yating; Cheng, Xiao			Monitoring Thermokarst Lake Drainage Dynamics in Northeast Siberian Coastal Tundra	REMOTE SENSING												Thermokarst lakes in permafrost regions are highly dynamic due to drainage events triggered by climate warming. This study focused on mapping lake drainage events across the Northeast Siberian coastal tundra from 2000 to 2020 and identifying influential factors. An object-based lake analysis method was developed to detect 238 drained lakes using a well-established surface water dynamics product. The LandTrendr change detection algorithm, combined with continuous Landsat satellite imagery, precisely dated lake drainage years with 83.2% accuracy validated against manual interpretation. Spatial analysis revealed the clustering of drained lakes along rivers and in subsidence-prone Yedoma regions. The statistical analysis showed significant warming aligned with broader trends but no evident temporal pattern in lake drainage events. Our machine learning model identified lake area, soil temperature, summer evaporation, and summer precipitation as the top predictors of lake drainage. As these climatic parameters increase or surpass specific thresholds, the likelihood of lake drainage notably increases. Overall, this study enhanced the understanding of thermokarst lake drainage patterns and environmental controls in vulnerable permafrost regions. Spatial and temporal dynamics of lake drainage events were governed by complex climatic, topographic, and permafrost interactions. Integrating remote sensing with field studies and modeling will help project lake stability and greenhouse gas emissions under climate change.					; Cheng, Xiao/AAT-6307-2020; Chen, Yating/AAT-5592-2020; Liu, Aobo/AAT-5467-2020	Chen, Yating/0000-0001-6710-0434; LIU, AOBO/0000-0001-8912-8729; Cheng, Xiao/0000-0001-6910-6565														2072-4292				SEP	2023	15	18							4396	10.3390/rs15184396	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs15184396													WOS:001118356200001

However, little is known about the effects of warming and increased N deposition on ecosystem respiration (Re) and methane (CH4) emission from subtropical wetland ecosystems. In this study, a manipulated warming and N addition experiment was conducted at a subtropical wetland in the littoral zone of Poyang Lake, China. Both Re and CH4 fluxes presented clear seasonal variations under all treatments. Warming significantly decreased Re by 20% compared with no warming and warming effect varied with growing season. Nevertheless, effects of N addition and the interaction of two treatments on Re were not detectable throughout the experimental period. Regardless of growing seasons, no treatments affected the temperature sensitivity of Re compared with the control. Contrary to the Re, CH4 flux was not affected by warming, but significantly affected by N addition and its interaction with warming in the whole and spring growing seasons. N addition decreased CH4 emission by 60% and 52% in the whole and spring growing seasons regardless of warming. Soil temperature was the primary driver for Re and explained about 60% of Re variation, while its explanation on CH4 flux was 13%. Soil moisture was not a limiting factor for Re and CH4 flux in this region. Our results imply that effects of warming and N addition on Re and CH4 flux varied with seasons, and these global changes tend to suppress carbon dioxide (CO2) and CH4 emission from this subtropical littoral wetland based on a short-term experiment. However, longer-term experiments are needed to see if this trend would persist and these effects should be included to project how the C sink function of subtropical littoral wetlands would respond to global changes.					; xu, jiaxing/HHZ-1740-2022; Xu, Ligang/K-2584-2013; Wu, Jianghua/P-3636-2019; Cheng, Junxiang/S-4125-2018; Jiang, Mingliang/GXG-4039-2022	Cheng, Junxiang/0000-0001-8717-9215; 													0341-8162	1872-6887				AUG	2022	215								106335	10.1016/j.catena.2022.106335	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.106335		MAY 2022											WOS:000804506700001

A novel high-resolution imaging protocol was used to photograph the varve record in the 87 cm-long freeze core CRA19-2FT-B2, collected from the deepest part similar to 23 m) of the lake in February 2019. High-resolution images were used to: (1) characterize varve couplets deposited between AD 1870 and 2000 (chronology verified through Cs-137/Pb-210 analysis of freeze core CRA22-1FRA-3, and consistent with the historic record of nuclear fallout and other proxies of the Great Acceleration); (2) document distinctive varves that permit a correlation between cores throughout the deep basin of Crawford Lake; (3) measure the thickness of individual dark and light- colored laminations, which were found to vary between 0.04 mm and 3.76 mm; and (4) carry out wavelet and spectral time series analyses based on varve thickness data that can be correlated to climatic trends and cycles. Time series analyses identified cycles with statistically significant periodicities that were attributed to the Quasi-biennial Oscillation (2.3 years), El Nino Southern Oscillation (2-7 years), the 11-year Schwabe Sunspot cycle and a possible Pacific Decadal Oscillation (50-70 years). This research not only provides baseline chronostratigraphic data that allow the correlation between freeze cores subsampled for various proxies, but also documents the dynamics of the climate drivers that influence the deposition of both organic matter and inorganically precipitated calcite. Crawford Lake is currently a candidate site under consideration for the Global boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) to define the Anthropocene series/epoch.

Here, we present a new high-resolution pollen record from Chaohu Lake to determine the detailed process of regional lowland vegetation succession and its response to the EASM changes during the last glacial-Holocene transition (13.9-9.1 cal ka BP) in the lower Yangtze Valley, eastern China. During the Older Dryas (OD, 13.9-13.5 cal ka BP) period, regional foreststeppe indicative of co-dominance of Artemisia, Poaceae, and deciduous Quercus was present under a cool and dry climate. During the Aller & oslash;d Interstadial (AI, 13.5-12.9 cal ka BP), significant arboreal expansions of deciduous Quercus, Hydrangea type and evergreen Quercus occurred, while herbs retreated significantly, presumably driven by the relatively warm, humid climate. Forest-steppe readvanced during the Younger Dryas (YD) interval, as indicated by increases in Poaceae and Artemisia, suggesting a cool and dry climate. During the early Holocene, extensive oak-pine forest flourished as regional vegetation, responding to pronounced climatic amelioration. Our pollen-based climatic record is closely correlated with stalagmites 818O records from EASM region and Greenland ice cores 818O records, indicating the teleconnection between EASM variation and North Atlantic climate during the last deglacial-early Holocene. However, our record indicates an intensified EASM during the early AI and a prolonged onset excursion during the YD, diverging from North Atlantic climate but closely correlated to sea surface temperature (SST) variations in the western tropical Pacific.

The phytoplankton community, which showed a decrease in concentration along a coastal-open sea gradient, was dominated by Dictyochophyceae (41%) followed by Dinophyceae (25%), Bacillariophyceae (16%), Cyanobacteriae (17%) and Euglenophyceae (1%). The phytoplankton found along the coast was dominated by opportunistic species (e.g. Dictyocha fibula) associated with high nutrient availability. In the open sea, phytoplankton development seemed influenced by Atlantic hydrodynamics. In addition, the Gulf of Gabes is characterized by an oligotrophic status with a summer stratification that impacted on species composition especially in off-shore areas. The coupling of phytoplankton dynamics to nutrients, ciliates and copepods showed the potential role played by ciliates not only as predators of phytoplankton but also as prey for filter-feeding copepods accounting for the increased fisheries productivity of the Gulf of Gabes.

J	JEWSON, DH				JEWSON, DH			INTERACTION OF COMPONENTS CONTROLLING NET PHYTOPLANKTON PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN A WELL-MIXED LAKE (LOUGH-NEAGH NORTHERN-IRELAND)	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												The homogeneous distribution of the phytoplankton in a shallow (mean depth 8.6 m) unstratified lake, Lough Neagh, Northern Ireland [United Kingdom], facilitated the study of the interaction of components controlling gross photosynthesis per unit area. These included the photosynthetic capacity, the phytoplankton content of the euphotic zone and a logarithmic function describing the effective radiation input. These factors were analyzed for 2 sites, the open lake and Kinnego Bay, which had standing crops of up to 90 and 300 mg chlorophyll a m-3 and maximum daily rates of gross integral photosynthesis of 11.7 and 15.6 g O2 m-2 day-1, respectively. Values are reduced by the high contribution to light attenuation by non-algal sources, which increases at low standing crops particularly in winter, when values of integral photosynthesis decrease to 0.5 g O2 m-2 day-1. This relative change is the result of self-shading behavior of the phytoplankton altering the crop content of the euphotic zone at different population densities. Changes in the irradiance function, incorporating day length, are largely responsible for the changes in daily rates of integral gross photosynthesis; as daily irradiance is a determinant of water temperature, it exerts further influence through the photosynthetic capacity which was strongly correlated with temperature. Much of the gain in gross photosynthesis resulting from higher photosynthetic capacity may not be reflected in a higher net column photosynthesis, because of the greater proportional rise in respiration with temperature. The balance in the water column between respiration losses and photosynthetic input may frequently alter since the ratio of illuminated to dark zones is between 1/4 to 1/5 in the open lake, and small shifts in any of the controlling features may result in conditions unfavorable for growth. This is analyzed especially for the increase of diatoms in spring, when small modifications of the underwater light field can delay growth.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1976	6	6					551	576		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1976.tb01646.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1976.tb01646.x													WOS:A1976CR59400008

Taxonomic identification and enumeration was done by the Utermoehl technique. About 125-150 spp. were identified in each basin. Less common or rare species contributed significantly to the total phytoplankton biomass. The species comparison among the 3 basins indicated that species like Rhodomonas minuta and Cryptomonas erosa were perennial in all the basins. Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, Anabaena spiroides var. contracta, Coscinodiscus rothii, Actinastrum hantzschii, and Ceratium hirundinella were typical for the Western basin. Ochromonas spp. and Peridinium aciculiferum were common in the Central basin; Gymnodinium helveticum and G. uberrimum were characteristic for the Eastern basin. The diatoms contributed least in the Eastern basin (36%) but showed a high percentage in both Central (55%) and Western (58%) basins. The phytoflagellates made important contributions in the 3 basins; the highest percentage (41%) was in the Eastern basin. Phytoflagellate abundance increased from west to east and appeared to have a wide range of adaptability to different nutrient conditions. During July and Aug. high biomass concentration but uneven horizontal distribution was observed. Phytoplankton biomass ranged between 0.8-13.2, 0.6 and 6.0 and 1.0-4.2 g/m3 in the Western, Central and Eastern basins, respectively. The highest biomass of 13.2 g/m3 was in the Western basin during April. Inshore-offshore differentiation was observed in the Central and Eastern basins with many peaks in the inshore region. Size analysis of phytoplankton on a few stations showed that the nannoplankton (.ltoreq. 64 .mu.) comprised a major portion of phytoplankton biomass during spring and fall periods. Based on maximum biomass concentration, the Lake Erie Western basin was classified as highly eutrophic, the Eastern basin as mesotrophic and the Central basin between the mesotrophic and eutrophic conditions.																									1976	33	3					581	600		10.1139/f76-075	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f76-075													WOS:A1976BJ94800018

Due to the barriers created by the Pir-Panjal ranges and the High Himalaya, Ladakh is located in a rain shadow zone of the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) making it a high-altitude desert. Occasional catastrophic hydrological events are known to endanger lives and properties of people residing there. Evidence of such events in the recent geologic past that are larger in magnitude than modern occurrences is preserved along the channels. Detailed investigation of these archives is imperative to expand our knowledge of extreme floods that rarely occur on the human timescale. Understanding the frequency, distribution, and forcing mechanisms of past extreme floods of this region is crucial to examine whether the causal agents are regional, global, or both on long timescales. We studied the Holocene extreme flood history of the Upper Indus catchment in Ladakh using slackwater deposits (SWDs) preserved along the Indus and Zanskar Rivers. SWDs here are composed of stacks of sand-silt couplets deposited rapidly during large flooding events in areas where a sharp reduction of flow velocity is caused by local geomorphic conditions. Each couplet represents a flood, the age of which is constrained using optically stimulated luminescence for sand and accelerator mass spectrometry and liquid scintillation counter C-14 for charcoal specks from hearths. The study suggests occurrence of large floods during phases of strengthened ISM when the monsoon penetrated into arid Ladakh. Comparison with flood records of rivers draining other regions of the Himalaya and those influenced by the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) indicates asynchronicity with the Western Himalaya that confirms the existing anti-phase relationship of the ISM-EASM that occurred in the Holocene. Detrital zircon provenance analysis indicates that sediment transportation along the Zanskar River is more efficient than the main Indus channel during extreme floods. Post-Last Glacial Maximum human migration, during warm and wet climatic conditions, into the arid upper Indus catchment is revealed from hearths found within the SWDs.					, dr dr/AAA-5406-2022; Kumar, Anil/K-3768-2014; Chahal, Poonam/AAC-1761-2020; Shukla, Uma/AAC-2357-2020; Srivastava, Pradeep/AAC-3039-2020	Kumar, Anil/0000-0003-1559-8589; Srivastava, Pradeep/0000-0002-9591-7764; SHARMA, CHOUDHURIMAYUM/0000-0003-3382-1932; 													0016-7606	1943-2674				JAN-FEB	2022	134	1-2					275	292		10.1130/B35976.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/B35976.1													WOS:000740439000008

The inspection was conducted under the State of Michigan's Stormwater, Asset Management and Wastewater (SAW) program. The pipeline was originally installed in 1982 and traverses a rural part of town. GLSWA had experienced some failures in the past and wanted to get the actual remaining wall-thickness of the pipeline by utilizing PICA's Remote Field Testing inspection tool, the SeeSnake. With an early onset of winter and frigid conditions many hurdles and obstacles had to be resolved to perform the inspection. This paper will detail how both GLSWA and PICA overcame them and will include verified defect accuracy (axially and clock position) inspection results.																					978-0-7844-7995-7				2016							237	244																WOS:000389583900023

Anthropogenic structures such as dams and tide gates serve as physical obstacles that limit river herring access to spawning habitat. This study examined the physical and ecological components affecting herring passage through a tide gate by applying a time-to-event analysis framework to multiple movement behaviors derived from telemetry data. Herring had higher passage success early in the season (78%) than later (16%). Key behaviors that govern passage varied with diel period, tide, and flow direction through the gates. Furthermore, these behaviors shifted as the season progressed, consistent with the hypothesis that predator avoidance may be driving passage failure late in the spawning season.

During the early Holocene (7900-7000 cal yr BP), vegetation changed from medium- and low-stature forest with nearby mangroves, to medium-stature forest. Between 6500 and 4700 cal yr BP, climate proxies indicate a transition from relatively moist to drier environmental conditions. Around 3500 cal yr BP, even drier conditions prevailed. These dry conditions correspond to the onset of dry phases identified elsewhere in Mexico and Central America. An inferred dry event at 1200 cal yr BP is correlated temporally with dry conditions inferred from a marine core taken in the Cariaco Basin, north of Venezuela. The dry episode falls within the ancient Maya Terminal Classic archaeological period. We found evidence for strong forest disturbance during that period. Around 700 cal yr BP (1200 AD), sediment variables indicate moister environmental conditions that fall within the period of the medieval climate optimum. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

J	SPENCE, DHN; DALE, HM				SPENCE, DHN; DALE, HM			VARIATIONS IN SHALLOW-WATER FORM OF POTAMOGETON-RICHARDSONII INDUCED BY SOME ENVIRONMENTAL-FACTORS	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Populations of P. richardsonii in Sparrow Lake, Ontario [Canada], vary greatly in leaf dimensions and internode length. Leaf length/breadth (L/B) ratio is increased by low irradiance, significantly at 4% daylight and, in contrary fashion, by ontogenetic drift at high irradiances of shallow water. L/B ratio was not correlated with substrate. This ratio is of doubtful value taxonomically or as an integrator, as specific leaf area is confirmed to be, of factors like photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Longest internodes belong to plants from deep (1.8 m) water, and, in a summer-grown high-density population, internode length decreases logarithmically as depth lessens; both observations implicate PAR and aging. Relative to undisturbed, shallow-water shoots, young transplants in full daylight elongate almost twice as fast because of the production of more, and longer, internodes. Young shoots in 12% daylight lengthen even more rapidly than those in full daylight (and 4 times faster than undisturbed shoots) in the same period because of quicker elongation of the same number of internodes. At ambient summer temperatures, this rate of elongation is inversely related to PAR. Experimental and seasonal field data indicate that maximal internode extension occurs on young shoots in very low irradiances at temperatures of 9-15.degree. C; in nature, effects of increasing water temperatures are depressed by increasing irradiances and aging until minimal extension takes place in old shoots at mid- to late-summer temperatures and in high irradiances. In tanks (40 m3) in full daylight, nutrients limit growth of plants on sand before they limit growth on clay (with marl intermediate) whereas, at 12% daylight, light limits growth on sand before soil nutrients do. The leaf area index on silty sand on an exposed shore was 0.4 at 0.5 m depth, in contrast to a cultured population where it was 4.0 in silty loam at the same depth. Thus, while it has not been possible to explain some variations in leaf morphology of P. richardsonii in environmental terms, the differential effects of ontogeny, PAR and temperature on shoot growth have been assessed, along with overall effects of light and nutrients on biomass and of shelter on leaf area index.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1978	8	3					251	268		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1978.tb01446.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1978.tb01446.x													WOS:A1978FD25600005
J	Xia, SS; Ji, XL; Meng, L; Zhou, LZ				Xia, Shanshan; Ji, Xianglin; Meng, Lei; Zhou, Lizhi			Functional Diversity of Wintering Waterbird Enhanced by Restored Wetland in the Lakeshore of Chaohu Lake	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												The primary goal of wetland restoration is to understand the species assembly process in order to strategically guide community development. Providing suitable habitats for waterbirds is one of the key objectives. In recent years, Chaohu Lake-a typical gate-controlled reservoir lake in the middle and lower Yangtze River floodplain-has faced wetland habitat homogenization due to sustained high- water- levels. This has made the maintenance of regional waterbird metacommunity diversity a critical concern. This study employed a trait-based approach, using Linear Mixed Models (LMMs) and Generalized Dissimilarity Modeling (GDM), to quantify the impacts of lakeshore wetland restoration (2020-2023) on wintering waterbird functional diversity. Results showed significant enhancements in functional alpha-diversity within restored wetlands (FRic, FDis, and FDiv, p < 0.01), highlighting the importance of habitat heterogeneity. Notably, restored wetlands exhibited coupled patterns of higher functional beta-diversity turnover rates and lower functional nestedness over time, forming distinctive species assemblages. Environmental filtering was primarily driven by trait loss mechanisms, with water depth and aquatic vegetation coverage identified as key drivers. In conclusion, wetland restoration significantly enhanced the functional diversity of wintering waterbirds in Chaohu Lake, emphasizing the critical role of functional diversity in evaluating restoration effectiveness for high- water- level gate-controlled floodplain lakes.					xianglin, ji/AAI-2277-2019; Zhou, Lizhi/AAF-4535-2021	zhouZhou, li zhiLizhi/0000-0002-5702-4658													2045-7758					JUL	2025	15	7							e71751	10.1002/ece3.71751	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.71751								40630087					WOS:001523454500001

L-1. High infection rates of more than 20% of the cells were observed between February and July except on a few occasions such as late April and late June. Mortality of infected diatom cells was temperature dependent in dialysis tube culture experiments; the loss rate of field populations due to fungal infection also was affected by temperature. Loss rates of diatom cells were negligibly small in February even though infection percentages were more than 20%, but increased toward summer with an increase in temperature. High infection percentages and correspondingly high loss rates (e.g. 0.3 d-1) occurred periodically during the summer. The results suggest that this type of host-parasite interaction is an important control of algal population size in natural waters.																			0022-3646	1529-8817				JUN	1990	26	2					239	244		10.1111/j.0022-3646.1990.00239.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0022-3646.1990.00239.x													WOS:A1990DJ81200005

Data on the distributions of pelagic and benthic Chaoborus flavicans larvae were gathered in 1994 and tested for their agreement with the predator avoidance hypotheses. The development of all Chaoborus Life stages, as well as the horizontal and vertical distribution in the four larval instars, was followed from May until October. We expected the largest larvae to dwell deeper by day, thus avoiding predation by visually foraging fish. 2. In agreement with this prediction body size increased with daytime depth, and this was true both between and within instars. The migration amplitude consequently increased with larval instar. 3. There was also evidence for horizontal migration, mainly in the third but also in the fourth instar. 4. Along a horizontal transect with increasing depth, locations with many benthic larvae had fewer pelagic larvae. Oxygen concentration was a good predictor of maximum benthic larval depth for most of the season but failed to predict their distribution in autumn.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				SEP	1999	42	2					201	213		10.1046/j.1365-2427.1999.444444.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.1999.444444.x													WOS:000082837600001
J	Wu, XD; Kong, FX				Wu, Xiaodong; Kong, Fanxiang			Effects of Light and Wind Speed on the Vertical Distribution of Microcystis aeruginosa Colonies of Different Sizes during a Summer Bloom	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY												Different dynamics, of the vertical distribution of Microcystis aeruginosa colonies of different sizes, were examined in a large shallow lake (Taihu Lake) during a summer bloom. During the observation the Microcystis colonies, larger than 120 mu m, were mainly concentrated in the upper layer both under calm and windy conditions. Colonies from 36 mu m to 120 mu m showed a clear relationship to wind conditions whereas colonies less than 36 mu m showed a nearly uniform vertical distribution at the different depths. There was no clear relationship between the vertical distribution of colonies larger than 36 mu m and light intensity. However, at solar noon, colonies less than 36 mu m were mainly distributed in the middle layers of the water column. The results indicate that small colonies are easily affected by the wind-induced mixing, and they show an ability for active movement in response to light intensity under calm conditions. In contrast, large colonies tend to show little diurnal repositioning to light intensity and thereby are mainly concentrated in the surface layer.

J	Nico, LG; Ropicki, AJ; Kilian, JV; Harper, M				Nico, Leo G.; Ropicki, Andrew J.; Kilian, Jay V.; Harper, Matthew			Asian swamp eels in North America linked to the live-food trade and prayer-release rituals	AQUATIC INVASIONS												We provide a history of swamp eel (family Synbranchidae) introductions around the globe and report the first confirmed nonindigenous records of Amphipnous cuchia in the wild. The species, native to Asia, is documented from five sites in the USA: the Passaic River, New Jersey (2007), Lake Needwood, Maryland (2014), a stream in Pennsylvania (2015), the Tittabawassee River, Michigan (2017), and Meadow Lake, New York (2017). The international live-food trade constitutes the major introduction pathway, a conclusion based on: (1) United States Fish and Wildlife Service's Law Enforcement Management Information System (LEMIS) database records revealing regular swamp eel imports from Asia since at least the mid-1990s; (2) surveys (2001-2018) documenting widespread distribution of live A. cuchia among ethnic food markets in the USA and Canada; (3) indications that food markets are the only source of live A. cuchia in North America; and (4) presence of live A. cuchia in markets close to introduction sites. Prayer release appears to be an important pathway component, whereby religious practitioners purchase live A. cuchia from markets and set them free. Prevalence of A. cuchia in US markets since 2001 indicates the species is the principal swamp eel imported, largely replacing members of the Asian complex Monopterus albus/javanensis. LEMIS records (July 1996-January 2017) document 972 shipments containing an estimated 832,897 live swamp eels entering the USA, although these data underestimate actual numbers due to undeclared and false reporting. LEMIS data reveal most imports originate in Bangladesh, Vietnam, and China. However, LEMIS wrongly identifies many imported swamp eels as "Monopterus albus"; none are identified as A. cuchia although specimens from Bangladesh and India are almost certainly this species. Some imported A. cuchia are erroneously declared on import forms as Anguilla bengalensis. To date, there is no evidence of A. cuchia reproduction in open waters of North America, presumably because it is a tropical-subtropical species and all introductions thus far have been in latitudes where winter water temperatures regularly fall near or below freezing.

Relationships between the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, precipitation, and nitrogen wet deposition rates in the contiguous United States	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												Human activities have significantly increased reactive nitrogen (N) in the environment, leading to adverse effects on various ecosystems. We used 1979-2012 seasonal inorganic N wet deposition data from the National Atmospheric Deposition Program to evaluate the relationship between the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and N wet deposition in the contiguous U.S. The correlations between precipitation and inorganic N wet deposition were the strongest and most spatially extensive during winter; up to 62% and 53% of the 2 to 6year variations of precipitation and N wet deposition rates, respectively, in the Rocky Mountains, along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico and near the Great Lakes, can be explained by variation in the NINO3.4 climate index, which was used as a measure of ENSO activity. During El Nino winters, precipitation and N wet deposition rates were higher than normal in the southern U.S., while La Nina events brought higher precipitation and N wet deposition to the Rocky Mountains and Great Lakes regions. Wintertime N wet deposition correlations held through springtime in the Great Lakes and the northeast; however, correlations between NINO3.4 and precipitation were not significant at most sites, suggesting factors besides precipitation amount contributed to the 2 to 6year variation of N wet deposition in these regions. As the frequency, strength, and types of ENSO change in the future, interannual variability of N wet deposition will be affected, indirectly affecting spatial distribution of dry N deposition and potentially changing the overall spatial patterns of N deposition.					; Evans, Raymond/A-8829-2010; Evans, Raymond/A-8829-2010	Chung, Serena/0000-0001-5030-5871; Evans, Raymond/0000-0002-0446-2806; Evans, Raymond/0000-0002-0446-2806													0886-6236	1944-9224				NOV	2016	30	11					1712	1724		10.1002/2016GB005439	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016GB005439													WOS:000390812300009
J	Paasche, O; Lovlie, R; Dahl, SO; Bakke, J; Nesje, A				Paasche, O; Lovlie, R; Dahl, SO; Bakke, J; Nesje, A			Bacterial magnetite in lake sediments: late glacial to Holocene climate and sedimentary changes in northern Norway	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												Magnetic properties of sediments retrieved from a small lake in northern Norway spanning the last similar to 14 500 cal. years have been analyzed in detail. The high-resolution core, with its ability to detect sub-centurial variability, records the rapid retreat of the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet (FIS) in northern Lyngen, and subsequently, the establishment of a stable Allerod to Younger Dryas watershed. From early Holocene and to the present magnetotactic bacteria (MB) producing stable single-domain (SSB) magnetite become the dominating magnetic carrier. The small, low relief catchment area, with its quartzite bedrock, scattered till and vegetated surface, generates a negligible contribution of detrital magnetic minerals. This allows for the opportunity to follow the presence and changes of the magnetosomes during the last 10 000 years. A strong positive statistical relationship (r(2) = 0. 83) between the anhysteretic remanent magnetisation susceptibility (chi(ARM)) and loss-on-ignition (LOI%) suggests an environmental 'control' over the bacteria magnitude [Quart. Int. 88 (2002) 13] that most likely is related to summer climate. A comparison between the magnetic mineralogy, as evident from the S-ratio (sigmaIRM(100mT)/sigmaSIRM(3T)), and the reconstructed summer temperatures from a nearby lake shows a close covariation between cooler summers and 'harder' S-ratios for a series of climatic events. Intervariability of LOI data and other proxies such as August sea-surface temperatures (SST) from the Nordic Sea, suggests land-ocean connections during converging phases of cooler climate, where the most prominent 'in-phase' periods are approximately (1) 6500-5000, (2) 3500-2400, and (3) 1700-1000 cal. years BP. The most significant change in the Holocene magnetic signal is initiated at similar to 3700 cal. years BP, which we refer to here as 'the Holocene Turnover'. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Current Hydrological Regime of the Volga Reservoirs	WATER RESOURCES												The study is focused on variations of air temperature in the basin of the Volga reservoirs, the total inflow into the water bodies, their water exchange, water level and temperature, and the heat content of water mass in open-water period under various climate conditions. The object of the analysis is the long-term series of hydrometeorological data processed by statistical methods. It is shown that the present-day air temperature has increased by 1.3-1.8 degrees C compared with the period before 1976. The rate of warming was on the average 0.50 degrees C/10 years. The volume of annual inflow increased by 12.4%. Three low-water and 4 high-water phases were identified in the reservoirs of the Upper Volga, including 29-31 low-water, 25-31 high-water, and 8-16 medium-water years. During the low-water phases, the volume of inflow into the reservoirs is 10-28% less than the long-term average, while in high-water years, it is 4-20% higher. The coefficient of water exchange in the reservoirs decreased or increased by 5-13% relative to the values obtained earlier. An increase in the winter and a decrease in the spring inflow were recorded in the reservoirs of the Upper Volga and in the Kuibyshev Reservoir. A tendency toward an increase in the normal annual water level was observed in the reservoirs in the upper part of the Volga and in the Kuibyshev Reservoir, while in the lower Volga, the normal annual level somewhat decreased. In low-water phases, the reservoir levels were on the average 17 cm below and in the high-water phases, 10 cm above the normal annual value. An increase in air temperature during the warm season in the reservoir water areas, on the average by 1.2 degrees C, led to a synchronous increase in the temperature of the water mass by 1.1 degrees C. At the same time, the heat content of the water mass of the reservoirs increased, on the average, by 24% in the upper part of the Volga and by as little as 2-11% in its lower part.

In the present paper we present environmental change during the last 2,400 years on a coastal peninsula in Norway using pollen data from three sites: one lake and two bogs, in addition to 621 radiocarbon dates and in-context pollen samples from archaeological sites. Locally, a close relationship between palynological richness reflecting high landscape, habitat and floristic diversity, and the summed probability distribution of radiocarbon dates was found. During the settlement period 400 BCE-550 CE, concordant with maximum number of dates from archaeological contexts, a mosaic landscape containing infields and outfields developed. Cereals were cultivated and animals were grazing in heathlands that could provide both summer grazing and winter fodder. Additionally, seashores and wetlands were used for grazing. Settlement recession from 350 CE and abandonment following the 536 CE climate event, resulted in vegetation successions toward reforestation, abandonment of arable fields, and marshes turning into ombrotrophic peat. At the same time the distance to the sea, and to species rich shoreline meadows, continued to increase due to continuous postglacial land uplift in a flat landscape. A new increase in the summed probability distribution 900-1250 CE, is reflected in expansion of outfield pastures, heathlands in particular, a management that continued up into modern time. The local development is supported by the results on a regional scale, indicating overall climatic and social causes for observed vegetation changes. Both palynological richness and pollen-based landcover reconstructions indicate reforestation and less habitat diversity in the sixth century. On a regional scale, reforestation in the fifteenth century following the late medieval crises, is more pronounced than on the local scale, although both reflect exploitation of outfield resources.

J	Matthews, DA; Effler, SW				Matthews, DA; Effler, SW			Assessment of long-term trends in the oxygen resources of a recovering urban lake, Onondaga Lake, New York	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Long-term trends in dissolved oxygen (DO) resources are documented for ionically enriched, hypereutrophic Onondaga Lake, New York, for 1978-2002. Assessments of oxygen resources are based on DO profiles of 1 m resolution conducted hourly to weekly during April-October. Closure of an industry that operated on the lake's shore until 1986 resulted in an abrupt decrease in primary production and organic carbon deposition and marked changes in hypolimnetic and epilimnetic DO regimes. The hypolimnetic DO response was gradual, reflecting the influence of sediment feedback. The onset of complete hypolimnetic anoxia, which occurred by early June through the 1980s, took place approximately one month later over 1997-2002. The anoxic factor decreased significantly over the study interval, from 97 +/- 5 d to 67 +/- 2 d. Epilimnetic DO concentrations responded rapidly to the abrupt change in lake metabolism. Before closure of the industry, 41% of the April to mid-September DO observations deviated from saturation concentrations by > 30%. In the years immediately following industry closure, this degree of disequilibrium occurred in 23% of DO observations. Percent saturation values during fall turnover increased gradually during the study, from 49 +/- 2 to 65 +/- 2. DO concentrations in the lake's upper waters have been subject to substantial diet fluctuations (> 4 mg/L), with daily minima and maxima generally occurring at approximately 7:00 and 16:00, respectively. Measurements made at 11:00 and 22:00 were most likely to be representative of daily average conditions. Diel variations and sampling frequency were demonstrated to be important issues for the evaluation of status with respect to water quality standards for DO. Levels of DO in the lake's upper waters have been positively correlated with chlorophyll a concentrations (r = 0.52). Despite marked improvements in DO resources, the lake continues to lack cool, well-oxygenated waters during summer necessary to support coldwater fish species.																			1040-2381					MAR	2006	22	1					19	32		10.1080/07438140609353881	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438140609353881													WOS:000236631800003
J	HAIG, SM; PLISSNER, JH				HAIG, SM; PLISSNER, JH			DISTRIBUTION AND ABUNDANCE OF PIPING PLOVERS - RESULTS AND IMPLICATIONS OF THE 1991 INTERNATIONAL CENSUS	CONDOR												Assessing status and recovery of the endangered Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus) requires knowledge of the species' current distribution and abundance throughout the annual cycle. To address this issue, over 1,000 biologists and volunteers from 10 nations collaborated in the 1991 International Piping Plover Census. Approximately 2,099 sites were censused yielding the highest number of breeding (5,482 adults) and wintering (3,451 birds) Piping Plovers ever recorded. Most winter birds occur-red in Texas (55%) and along other United States Gulf Coast sites (93%). Among winter birds, 51% used ocean beaches, 43% used sand or algal flats in protected bays, and 6% used areas where protected bays met ocean beaches. Breeding birds were widely distributed in small populations in the Northern Great Plains/Prairie (63.2%) and on the Atlantic Coast (36%). Few birds (N = 39) remain on the Great Lakes. Habitat use among breeding birds varied considerably across the species range. While most Atlantic (93.9%) and Great Lakes (100%) birds used sandy beaches, 59.6% of Northern Great Plains/Prairie birds used shorelines around small alkaline lakes, 18.2% used large reservoir beaches, 19.9% used river islands and adjacent sand pits, 2% used beaches on large lakes, and 0.4% used industrial pond shorelines. Change in status from previous censuses was difficult to determine. New populations were found in Montana, Colorado, and Saskatchewan, Canada; however, the distribution gap between Atlantic and Northern Great Plains/Prairie Piping Plover distribution grows as numbers decline in Minnesota; Manitoba, Canada; and the Great Lakes. Repeated international censuses every five years and a better assessment of reproductive success in local populations will help determine future population trends for the species.																				1938-5129				FEB	1993	95	1					145	156		10.2307/1369396	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1369396													WOS:A1993KQ36700015

Sediment samples were collected from the lake, and results showed that the values of the eight heavy metals all fell within the Second Soil National Standard, while the average and maximum values of the metals were higher than the background values of the study. Multivariate statistical analysis showed that sediment concentrations of Cd, Pb, Hg, and Zn were mainly influenced by man sources. In comparison, Cu, Ni, Cr, and As were primarily natural in origin. Enrichment factor analysis (EF) and the geo-accumulation index evaluation method (I (geo)) showed that Cd, Hg, and Pb fell under low and partial serious pollution levels, while Zn, As, Cr, Ni, and Cu mainly were characterized under no pollution and low pollution levels. The potential ecological hazards index (RI) showed that among the eight heavy metals, Pb, Hg, and Cd posed the highest potential ecological risk, with potential ecological hazards indices (RI) of 29.06, 27.71, and 21.54 %, respectively. These findings demonstrated that recent economic development in the area of the basin has led to heavy metal accumulation in the surface sediments of the lake.																			0944-1344	1614-7499				APR	2016	23	8					7255	7265		10.1007/s11356-015-6020-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-015-6020-3								26769477					WOS:000374994600021

Therefore, a field investigation of surficial sediments was conducted in wetland waterways in the Terrebonne Parish, the St. Bernard Parish, and the Rigolets in coastal Louisiana. In situ tests were conducted at 290 locations using a portable free-fall penetrometer, supported by seven sediment core samples and data available from the literature. The results allowed the authors to map changes in sediment strength and stratification and discuss them with regard to local site characteristics, such as sediment type, abundance of vegetation, and vicinity to human-made structures and engineering activities, and to the local geomorphology. Stiff sediments were observed at submerged banks and bars. Two lakes differed significantly in their sediment-strength profiles, indicating differences in sediment-deposition history. Meandering resulted in an asymmetry of the geotechnical cross-channel profile. In summary, geotechnical sediment characteristics seem to reflect the inferred local sediment dynamics.

This channel is an important winter habitat for the endemic Alburnus scoranza Heckel & Kner, 1858 (Cyprinidae). In the last decade, the channel has been intensely used as a marina, which has caused major changes in the aquatic ecosystem. Similarly, in recent years, when the water level of the lake and the channel was lowered, fish pestilence was often recorded. We present data on histological and haematological studies of population of A. scoranza from the Channel Studencista. Our results suggest good health condition of fish population. The oxygen saturation of the water is a crucial factor for fish health during the winter 2017 and 2018.

NITROGEN	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Agricultural watersheds (11) in southern Ontario [Canada] were sampled .apprx. 3000 times during 1975-1977 for total Kjeldahl N (TKN) and NO3-N as part of the Canadian activities of the Pollution from Land Use Activities Reference Group (PLUARG). Only 12% of runoff samples had NO3-N concentrations < 0.3 mg/l; 3% of the samples exceeded the 10-mg/l Ontario drinking water standard. Two-year-average total N stream loadings ranged from 3.5-29.2 kg N watershed/ha. The NO3-N loads averaged 75% of total N loads over all 11 watersheds. Both NO3-N and total N area loads were significantly correlated with total N addition to the watershed, and with percent of watershed under cultivation, in row-crops and corn (Zea mays), or tile-drained. The TKN loads were positively correlated with watershed surface-soil clay content and with extent of soils with high surface runoff potential. Remedial measures to reduce stream N loading should only be considered for watersheds where stream N loading greatly exceeds inputs of N from precipitation. In these watersheds, improved fertilizer N efficiency in corn production may provide the greatest potential for reduced stream N loading. Proper location of manure storage sites is important to minimize N pollution from livestock activities. About 70% of stream NO3-N and total N loading occurred from Jan.-April during the spring runoff season. Agronomic practices that reduce postharvest leachable soil N or erosion during spring runoff merit future research.																			0047-2425	1537-2537					1982	11	3					493	497		10.2134/jeq1982.00472425001100030034x	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq1982.00472425001100030034x													WOS:A1982PC56800034
J	RAMSEY, WL				RAMSEY, WL			DISSOLVED OXYGEN IN SWEETWATER LAKE	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												In Sweetwater Lake, near San Diego, California, vertical distribution of dissolved oxygen was observed to be highly stratified during the early summer months. With the lake at a maximum depth of about 32 ft, the lower 5 to 10 ft were devoid of oxygen by early July but mid-depths and upper levels remained well-oxygenated throughout the period of observation. The pattern of oxygen distribution in the lake appeared to reflect the prevailing summer circulation which consisted of rapid down-wind movement at the surface with counter-currents at mid-depths and smaller circulation cells at lower depths. Rising summer temperatures caused an increase in the depth of the upper layer of water saturated or supersaturated with oxygen. The drop in solubility of oxygen due to heating of the surface layers of water was proportionally greater than the decrease in oxygen content, producing an increase in saturation values. Thermal stratification seemed to be sufficient, by reduced vertical mixing, to maintain the lake in a condition of oxygen-rich epilimnion and oxygen-depleted hypolimnion. Serial observations showed a diurnal cycle of rising oxygen content in the surface layers in late afternoon and evening, probably the results of the photosynthetic activity of the phytoplankton and the circulation of high oxygen water from the shallow end of the lake. Simultaneous sampling of the water at various depths for oxygen analysis and measurement of light transmission with a hydrophotometer produced no correlation between oxygen content and turbidity. Simultaneous measurement of sound velocity, attenuation and oxygen content also produced no conclusive results.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1960	5	1					34	42		10.4319/lo.1960.5.1.0034	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1960.5.1.0034													WOS:A1960WU64100003

Despite LCY tephra being an important marker horizon, a radioisotopic age for this eruption has remained elusive. Using zircon (U-Th)/He geochronology, we present the first radioisotopically determined eruption age for the LCY of 75 +/- 2 ka. Additionally, the youngest zircon crystallization U-238-Th-230 rim ages in their respective samples constrain eruption age maxima for two other tephra units that erupted from Atitlan caldera, W-Fall (130 (+16)/(-14) ka) and I-Fall eruptions (56 (+8.2)/(-7.7) ka), which under- and overlie LCY tephra, respectively. Moreover, rim and interior zircon dating and glass chemistry suggest that before eruption silicic magma was stored for >80 kyr, with magma accumulation peaking within ca. 35 kyr before the LCY eruption during which the system may have developed into a vertically zoned magma chamber. Based on an updated distribution of LCY pyroclastic deposits, a new conservatively estimated volume of similar to 1220 +/- 150 km(3) is obtained (volcanic explosivity index VEI > 8), which confirms the LCY eruption as the first-ever recognized supereruption in Central America.					; Danisik, Martin/GQY-6103-2022; Schmitt, Axel/A-1279-2010; Cisneros de León, Alejandro/AAR-2258-2021; Wang, Kuo-Lung/B-7399-2009	Belo, Julie Christin/0000-0001-5865-3272; Harvey, Janet/0000-0002-3808-732X; Danisik, Martin/0000-0002-0885-4938; Cisneros de Leon, Alejandro/0000-0002-0133-2838; Schmitt, Axel/0000-0002-9029-4211; Wang, Kuo-Lung/0000-0002-6447-2168													0267-8179	1099-1417				FEB	2021	36	2					169	179		10.1002/jqs.3265	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jqs.3265		JAN 2021											WOS:000606624600001

Under the LT2ESWTR the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) requires public water systems treating surface water (SW) or groundwater under the direct influence of surface water (GWUDI) to determine the average source water Cryptosporidium concentration and corresponding bin for each treatment plant. This article describes publicly available round 1 results, including quality assurance review of the data, binning outcomes, USEPA method 1623 oocyst recovery, and relationships between Cryptosporidium and Escherichia coli results. Overall, 7% of plants at large systems fell in bin 2 and must implement additional treatment for Cryptosporidium (no plants fell in bins 3 or 4). Plants with flowing stream (FS) surface water supplies are more highly affected (15% in bin 2) than those with GWUDI (2.5%) or reservoir/lake (RL; 3.1%) surface water supplies.

The carbon stable isotope biogeochemistry of streams, Taylor Valley, Antarctica	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY					9th International Symposium on Applied Isotope Geochemistry (AIG)	SEP 19-23, 2011	Tarragona, SPAIN					The McMurdo Dry Valleys region of Antarctica is the largest ice-free region on the continent. This study reports the first C stable isotope measurements for dissolved inorganic C present in ephemeral streams in four dry valleys that flow for four to twelve weeks during the austral summer. One of these valleys, Taylor Valley, has been the focus of the McMurdo Dry Valleys Long-Term Ecological Research (MCM-LTER) program since 1993. Within Taylor Valley, numerous ephemeral streams deliver water to three perennially ice- covered, closed-basin lakes: Lake Fryxell, Lake Hoare, and Lake Bonney. The Onyx River in the Wright Valley, the longest river in Antarctica, flows for 40 km from the Wright Lower Glacier and Lake Brownworth at the foot of the glacier to Lake Vanda. Streamflow in the McMurdo Dry Valley streams is produced primarily from glacial melt, as there is no overland flow. However, hyporheic zone exchange can be a major hydrogeochemical process in these streams. Depending on landscape position, these streams vary in gradient, channel substrate, biomass abundance, and hyporheic zone extent. This study sampled streams from Taylor, Wright, Garwood, and Miers Valleys and conducted diurnal sampling of two streams of different character in Taylor Valley. In addition, transect sampling was undertaken of the Onyx River in Wright Valley. The delta C-13(PDB) values from these streams span a range of greater than 14 parts per thousand, from -9.4 parts per thousand to +5.1 parts per thousand, with the majority of samples falling between -3 parts per thousand and +2 parts per thousand, suggesting that the C stable isotope composition of dissolved C in McMurdo Dry Valley streams is largely inorganic in character. Because there are no vascular plants on this landscape and no groundwater input to these streams, atmospheric exchange is the dominant control on delta C-13-DIC. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This transition might not be sustainable, as climate and environmental change have unknown effects on the visitation patterns of outdoor recreationists and tourists. We address this uncertainty by estimating shifts in the demand for outdoor recreation destinations along Minnesota's North Shore region of Lake Superior under a range of projected climatic and environmental conditions. We also employ a finite-mixture modeling approach to capture the preference heterogeneity across North Shore visitors. Our findings indicate projected climate and environmental changes are not likely to significantly affect visitation patterns in the next 20 years. However, utilizing a finite-mixture modeling approach enabled us to identify distinct types of visitors with divergent visitation behaviors under altered climate and environmental conditions. Our findings suggest that the demand for outdoor recreation along the North Shore will be relatively stable in the near future, however different types of visitors will respond to warming winter conditions in divergent ways. Shifting visitation patterns under climate and environmental change may have more drastic alterations to the economic well-being of the region under a longer planning horizon. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, we studied the blackbird roost at Millers Lake, Evangeline Parish, Louisiana, each spring from 1986 to 1988 to document roost size, species composition, and distribution patterns of foraging flocks in nearby rice fields. We report on the final year of study and discuss the relationship of roost size to options for controlling bird damage in spring-planted rice. The number of birds roosting at Millers Lake declined from 18 million in mid-February to 6,300 in late April 1988. In March and April, female red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) were proportionally more abundant than male red-winged blackbirds or other species of blackbirds or European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris). The mean number of birds, flock size, and number of flocks that foraged in fields were not correlated with roost size.

We investigated the configuration of permafrost and a talik under a thermokarst lake on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), China, using GPR, electrical resistivity tomography, drilling and ground temperature measurements. The boundaries and ice content of permafrost and the talik were identified adjacent to and under the lake. The thickness of permafrost differed by about 4m on opposite sides of the lake. The thickness and extent of ice-rich permafrost under the northwest shore was greater than under the southeast shore. A talik penetrated the permafrost base beneath both the shallower and deeper parts of the lake, where water depths were all less than the maximum thickness of winter ice. The talik was wider beneath shallower parts of the lake than in deeper areas. This investigation demonstrates that a through-talik developed although the water depth was less than the maximum thickness of winter ice, indicating that the general relation between water depth and ice thickness is not reliable for identifying the nature of taliks on the QTP.

Paleoproductivity and organic matter sources in Late Quaternary Lake Ontario	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												We have examined delta C-13 of ostracode valves and clam shells, carbon and nitrogen mass accumulation rates (C-and N-MAR), atomic C/N and delta C-13(OM) from Lake Ontario since similar to 16,000 cal BP to evaluate the impacts of the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS) and regional paleohydrology on primary lacustrine productivity and sources of OM. Samples were obtained from piston cores from each of the Niagara, Mississauga and Rochester basins, which geographically span Lake Ontario from west to east. During the glacial period, variations in inputs directly from the LIS versus up-stream glacial Lake Algonquin and (or) ancient Lake Erie controlled the DIC pool in ancestral Lake Ontario. Cold and dry conditions limited primary productivity in the Ontario basin (low C/N similar to 7.5). Increased contributions of glacial meltwater from glacial Lake Algonquin during the latter stages of deglaciation provided a uniform supply of DIC to ancestral Lake Ontario and other lakes then occupying the Huron and Erie basins, stabilizing the delta C-13(DIC) pool at similar to-4 parts per thousand. (VPDB). Upon hydrologic closure of early Lake Ontario at the onset of post-glacial conditions (12,300 cal BP), a growing divergence between the delta C-13 of ostracode valves (decreases to -6 parts per thousand) and clam shells (increases to + 1 parts per thousand) indicates differences in summer versus spring DIC pools. The end of glacial meltwater input to early Lake Ontario also made it possible to detect changes in primary lacustrine productivity using the isotopic and C/N proxies. Increasing delta C-13(OM) (from similar to-29 to -27.5 parts per thousand) and low C/N (<10) during post-glacial times across Lake Ontario generally support rising primary lacustrine productivity during hydrologic closure and following return to overflow conditions after 8300 cal BP.

However, the limited dating range (< 50 ka) of C-14 dating has restricted high resolution research on the last glacial cycle.We presented a relative paleointensity (RPI) record from a lacustrine sedimentary core from the Heqing Basin to optimize its AMS C-14 chronology. Detailed rock magnetic analyses indicated that SD and vortex state magnetite (and/or maghemite) was the dominant magnetic mineral of lacustrine sediments. Moderate variations in concentration-dependent (SIRM, ARM) and grain-size-dependent (ARM/SIRM) parameters satisfied the criteria for the RPI studies. Consequently, we determined the RPI by NRM20-40 mT/SIRM20-40 mT, where NRM20-40 mT denotes the NRM after demagnetization between 20 and 40 mT. Using 6 AMS C-14 dates younger than 40 ka BP as constraints, 7 age control points were determined by correlating the lows in the RPI record with those of the target paleointensity stacks PISO-1500. We established a reliable chronological framework of the upper 11.1 m of the HQ drill core by binomial fitting based on the 7 RPI age control points and the climatic transition termination II. The consistent variations in our RPI curve and other global target paleointensity curves indicated that the optimized chronology was reliable.In our optimized chronology, the visible precession cycle in ARM/SIRM indicated that the ISM was a direct response to solar insolation during the last glacial cycle. The strong ISM suggested by the high content of Mesic conifers and tropical and subtropical trees during MIS 3 shifted to MIS 5a. Thus, the "MIS 3 Mega-paleolake " hypothesis in China, which was mainly deduced by the C-14 age model, was challenged.

The microbial assemblage was vertically stratified and distributions of individual ribotypes were coherent with temperature, salinity, irradiance and dissolved oxygen distributions at the beginning of the study in July of 1994. The lake mixed completely during the winter of 1994-1995 and was beginning to stratify thermally by April 1995. Water column gradients were weak and oxygen was depleted at depth. The microbial assemblage was uniformly distributed throughout the water column except at 20 m, where one band dominated. The microbial assemblage was vertically stratified again by July 1995. Partial sequences (134-160 bp, except one of 83 bp) obtained from DGGE bands revealed affinities to known organisms, but only one potentially exact match was found. With a few exceptions, the same ribotypes were present on all sampling dates; there was no evidence for a marked seasonal succession in microbial community composition, despite the dramatic changes in limnological conditions that accompanied the winter overturn. A band that was ubiquitous in samples from the oxycline and hypolimnion in July of both years was found throughout the water column in April. This sequence could be attributed to the chloroplast rRNA gene of an unusual phytoplankter, the green alga Picocystis salinarum.

Projecting the impacts of future climate changes on fire-mediated biogeochemical processes requires understanding of how various climatic factors influence regional fire regimes. However, long-term variations in fire activity and their controls are poorly known. In this study, we report the concentration of black carbon (BC) and its isotopic composition (delta C-13(BC)) in an upland lake sediment core from southwest China in order to elucidate linkages between changes in fire regime, climate and vegetation over the past 18.5 ka. The results show that the sedimentary BC content recorded variations in fire activity and exhibits a close negative correlation with the amount of precipitation delivered by the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM). During Heinrich Event 1 (18.5-15.0 cal ka BP), the Younger Diyas (12.8-11.1 cal ka BP) and the mid- to late-Holocene, the weakening of the ISM led to greatly increased fire activity in southwest China. In the last 1.0 ka, the BC record may have been affected by human activity in the catchment which may have caused an increased influx of minerogenic material to the lake thereby diluting the sedimentary BC concentration. The general trend of changing vegetation compositions inferred from the delta C-13(BC) values also tracks the variations of the ISM, suggesting a change from mixed C-3/C-4-plant ecosystems during the last glacial maximum to C-3-plant-dominated forest during the Holocene. However, the abundance of C-4 plants may be overestimated during the Bolling-Allerod warm interval and the early Holocene due to the fact that fires were probably limited to the savanna ecosystem in the valleys and low-lying basins.

High- and low-affinity phosphate uptake and its effect on phytoplankton dominance in a phosphate-depauperate lake	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Phosphorus (P) is an essential element for phytoplankton growth, and in recent years our understanding of P use based on kinetics has been overturned with new knowledge of the complexity of P utilization. However, much of this knowledge is based on culture studies with individual species. Our objective was to measure the effect of dissolved inorganic P (DIP) concentrations on DIP uptake rates by phytoplankton, in the context of seasonal phytoplankton succession in a large monomictic, DIP-depauperate lake. We demonstrated an inverse relationship be tween surface DIP concentration and DIP uptake rate, with substantially higher uptake rates occurring under thermally stratified, DIP-depauperate conditions. The combination of surface water DIP concentration and water temperature explained 50.3% of the variation in uptake rates. DIP concentration explained the majority of variation, with a concentration of 4.75 mu g DIP l(-1) appearing to be a transition between low-and high-affinity uptake. Variability below 4.75 mu g DIP l-1 was further explained by water temperature. High-affinity DIP uptake was most common when Cyanobacteria dominated the phytoplankton assemblage. We validated our field results by conducting a DIP starvation study on an isolate of a dominant cyanobacterium, Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii. High-affinity uptake was demonstrated as the culture became progressively starved of P. Our findings indicate that rapid DIP scavenging via high-affinity uptake is advantageous under DIP-depauperate conditions during the summer-stratification period. It may also contribute to the switch from diatom/cryptophyte/chlorophyte dominance to cyanobacterial dominance in summer. This study also has implications for phytoplankton-nutrient models, which typically do not incorporate high-affinity P uptake.

J	Hui, J; Yao, L				Hui, Jiang; Yao, Liu			A Method to Upscale the Leaf Area Index (LAI) Using GF-1 Data with the Assistance of MODIS Products in the Poyang Lake Watershed	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												A leaf area index is a key parameter reflecting the growth changes of vegetation and one of the most important canopy structural parameters for performing quantitative analyses of many ecological and climate models. Although using high-resolution satellite data and the radiative transfer model (RTM) can be used to generate high resolution LAI products, the RTM method has some problems because its temporal resolution is low, the input parameters are more appropriate for a physics model, and some parameters are difficult to obtain. Problems that urgently need to be solved include improving the temporal-spatial resolution for LAI products and localizing LAI products. To explore an applicable method for the high-resolution LAI products in a small basin and to improve the inversion accuracy, we propose an approach for GF-1 WFV LAI retrieval using MOD15A2 data and the measured LAI of the Poyang Lake watershed. Empirical models were used to retrieve high resolution LAI values, and the results show that these models are well designed for analyzing time-series satellite data. Good correlations were obtained between the NDVI of the GF-1 WFV data, the retrieved LAI values and the MODIS LAI data from samples acquired in both summer and winter. The exponential NDVI model obtained the best LAI value estimation results from the GF-1 WFV data (R2 = 0.697, RMSE = 1.100); the best synthetic validation of the RMSE is 0.883, close to the optimum model. Therefore, the retrieval results more fully reflect the growth process of the different features. This study proposed an upscale method for developing a high spatial resolution GF-1 satellite standard LAI products retrieval model using MODIS data. The proposed method will be helpful for efficiently improving the temporal-spatial resolution of LAI products to benefit the extraction of vegetation parameter information and dynamic land use monitoring.																			0255-660X	0974-3006				APR	2018	46	4					551	560		10.1007/s12524-017-0731-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12524-017-0731-5													WOS:000433003500006

Chile gathers a wide range of extreme environments: salars, geothermal springs, and geysers located at Altiplano and Atacama Desert, salars and cold mountains in Central Chile, and ice fields, cold lakes and fjords, and geothermal sites in Patagonia and Antarctica. The aims of this review are to describe extremophiles that inhabit main extreme biotopes in Chile, and their molecular and physiological capabilities that may be advantageous for bioremediation processes. After briefly describing the main ecological niches of extremophiles along Chilean territory, this review is focused on the microbial diversity and composition of these biotopes microbiomes. Extremophiles have been isolated in diverse zones in Chile that possess extreme conditions such as Altiplano, Atacama Desert, Central Chile, Patagonia, and Antarctica. Interesting extremophiles from Chile with potential biotechnological applications include thermophiles (e.g., Methanofollis tationis from Tatio Geyser), acidophiles (e.g., Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, Leptospirillum ferriphilum from Atacama Desert and Central Chile copper ores), halophiles (e.g., Shewanella sp. Asc-3 from Altiplano, Streptomyces sp. HKF-8 from Patagonia), alkaliphiles (Exiguobacterium sp. SH31 from Altiplano), xerotolerant bacteria (S. atacamensis from Atacama Desert), UV- and Gamma-resistant bacteria (Deinococcus peraridilitoris from Atacama Desert) and psychrophiles (e.g., Pseudomonas putida ATH-43 from Antarctica). The molecular and physiological properties of diverse extremophiles from Chile and their application in bioremediation or waste treatments are further discussed. Interestingly, the remarkable adaptative capabilities of extremophiles convert them into an attractive source of catalysts for bioremediation and industrial processes.

At the end of July Rutilus arcasii moved from slow-water shallow marginal areas to zones of faster current, deeper and further from the bank. In October Barbus bocagei and Gobio gobio showed a preference for deep, structurally complex areas; contrasting with a more or less random habitat use in july. Both habitats shifts appeared to be related to foraging tactics. Extreme conditions (zero flow) in September precluded the expression of clear selectivities or interspecific differences in habitat use. High interspecific overlap in habitat use was almost the rule, only current speed showed relatively low overlap values. This variable also appeared as an important influence in the general pattern of habitat utilization by juvenile fish.																			0003-9136					SEP	1992	125	3					323	337																WOS:A1992JW02700005

Deglaciation on KGI began after c. 15 cal. ka BP and had progressed to within present-day limits on the Fildes Peninsula, its largest ice-free peninsula, by c. 6.6-5.3 cal. ka BP. Probability density phase analysis of chronological data constraining Holocene glacier advances on KGI revealed up to eight 95% probability 'gaps' during which readvances could have occurred. These are grouped into four stages - Stage 1: a readvance and marine transgression, well-constrained by field data, between c. 7.4 and 6.6 cal. ka BP; Stage 2: four probability 'gaps', less well-constrained by field data, between c. 5.3 and 2.2 cal. ka BP; Stage 3: a well-constrained but restricted 'readvance' between c. 1.7 and 1.5 cal. ka BP; Stage 4: two further minor 'readvances', one less well-constrained by field data between c. 1.3 and 0.7 cal. ka BP (68% probability), and a 'final' well-constrained 'readvance' after <0.7 cal. ka BP. The Stage 1 readvance occurred as colder and more negative Southern Annular Mode (SAM)-like conditions developed, and marginally stronger/poleward shifted westerly winds led to more storms and precipitation on the SSI. Readvances after c. 5.3 cal. ka BP were possibly more frequent, driven by reducing spring/summer insolation at 62 degrees S and negative SAM-like conditions, but weaker (equatorward shifted) Westerlies over the SSI led to reduced storminess, restricting readvances within or close to present day limits. Late Holocene readvances were anti-phased with subaquatic freshwater moss layers in lake records unaffected by glaciofluvial inputs. Retreat from 'Neoglacial' glacier limits and the recolonisation of lakes by subaquatic freshwater moss after 1950 CE is associated with recent warming/more positive SAM-like conditions.

The combined analysis of methane and noble gas concentrations in the pore water opens a novel route to analyse and quantify such emissions and was used in this work to explore the gas dynamics in the sediments of two lakes with different hydro-geochemical settings. In the hypertrophic Lake Rot the microbial activity in the sediment pore water results in a virtually continuous gas bubble formation and emission. By determining noble gas concentration gradients and the maximum methane supersaturation, the minimum methane emission from the sediment was quantified. The gas evolution in the pore water of the sediments of artificial Lake Lungern is strongly affected by annual lake level variations of up to 20 m. Noble gas concentrations allow past gas dynamics at different lake levels to be traced back. At "hot spots" of bubble emission microbial methane from deeper sediments was released in response to the decreasing hydrostatic pressure, i.e. man-induced lake level drop. Within zones of the sediment that seasonally fall dry, the air supply to the sediment was inferred from the noble gas excess observed in the pore water, which is due to dissolving air bubbles which entered the sediment during the dry period. These case studies demonstrate the potential of the combined analysis of noble gas and CH4 concentrations for exploring the gas dynamics in lacustrine sediments. The feasibility of this method under different conditions calls for an application in other aquatic environments, such as wetlands and oceans.					; Tomonaga, Yama/ABG-9540-2020	Tomonaga, Yama/0000-0003-2871-8826; 													0009-2541	1872-6836				MAY 5	2021	568								119905	10.1016/j.chemgeo.2020.119905	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2020.119905		MAR 2021											WOS:000636052200001

The project consisted of raising the grade of a timber structure with tire shreds. The bridge is located on the only route to the East Shore of Pushaw Lake, where 50 families reside year-round. The bridge over-topped with 600 mm of water during the Spring runoff. The design consisted of raising the grade at the driving surface using 600 mm of tire shreds. Compression test results were used to determine a tire shred unit weight after construction of 0.76 Mg/m(3) and the required amount of overbuild of 60 mm. At-rest earth conditions and equivalent fluid pressure methods were used to design a permanent, timber lagging retaining system. Staged-construction plans utilized a temporary, geotextile wrap wall, designed using active earth pressure conditions. The $1.3 million final cost saved 87% over replacement alternatives.																					0-7844-0744-4				2004		126					740	749																WOS:000227500700061

Return of large-bodied zooplankton populations is of key importance for creating a shift from a turbid to a clear-water state in shallow lakes after a nutrient loading reduction. In temperate lakes, recovery is promoted by submerged macrophytes which function as a daytime refuge for large zooplankton. However, recovery of macrophytes is often delayed and use of artificial plant beds (APB) has been suggested as a tool to enhance zooplankton refuges, thereby reinforcing the shift to a clear-water state and, eventually, colonisation of natural plants. 2. To further evaluate the potential of APB in lake restoration, we followed the day-night habitat choices of zooplankton throughout summer in a clear and a turbid lake. Observations were made in the pelagic and littoral zones and in APB in the littoral representing three different plant densities (coverage 0%, 40% and 80%). 3. In the clear lake, the zooplankton (primarily Daphnia) were mainly found in the pelagic area in spring, but from mid-May they were particularly abundant in the APB and almost exclusively so in mid-June and July, where they appeared in extremely high densities during day (up to 2600 ind. L-1). During night Daphnia densities were overall more equally distributed between the five habitats. Ceriodaphnia was proportionally more abundant in the APB during most of the season. Cyclopoids were more abundant in the high APB during day but were equally distributed between the five habitats during night. 4. In the turbid lake, however, no clear aggregation was observed in the APB for either of the pelagic genera (Daphnia and Bosmina). This may reflect a higher refuge effect in the open water due to the higher turbidity, reduced ability to orient to plant beds and a significantly higher fish density (mainly of roach, Rutilus rutilus, and perch, Perca fluviatilis) in the plant beds than in the clear lake. Chydorus was found in much higher proportions among the plants, while cyclopoids, particularly the pelagic Cyclops vicinus, dominated in the pelagic during day and in the pelagic and high density plants during night. 5. Our results suggest that water clarity is decisive for the habitat choice of large-bodied zooplankton and that introduction of APB as a restoration measure to enhance zooplankton survival is only a useful tool when water clarity increases following loading reduction. Our results indicate that dense APB will be the most efficient.

J	Steenburgh, WJ				Steenburgh, WJ			One hundred inches in one hundred hours: Evolution of a Wasatch Mountain winter storm cycle	WEATHER AND FORECASTING												Synoptic, orographic, and lake-effect precipitation processes during a major winter storm cycle over the Wasatch Mountains of northern Utah are examined using radar imagery, high-density surface data, and precipitation observations from Alta Ski Area [ 2600 - 3200 m above mean sea level (MSL)] and nearby Salt Lake City International Airport ( 1288 m MSL). The storm cycle, which occurred from 22 to 27 November 2001, included two distinct storm systems that produced 108 in. ( 274 cm) of snow at Alta Ski Area, including 100 in. ( 254 cm) during a 100-h period. Each storm system featured an intrusion of low equivalent potential temperature (theta(e)) air aloft, well in advance of a surface-based cold front. Prefrontal precipitation became increasingly convective as low-theta(e) air aloft moved over northern Utah, while cold frontal passage was accompanied by a convective line and a stratiform precipitation region. Postfrontal destabilization led to orographic and lake-effect snow-showers that produced two-thirds of the observed snow water equivalent at Alta. Storm stages were defined based on the passage of the above features and their accompanying changes in stability and precipitation processes. Contrasts between mountain and lowland precipitation varied dramatically from stage to stage and storm to storm, and frequently deviated from climatology, which features a nearly fourfold increase in precipitation between Salt Lake City and Alta. Based on the two storms, as well as other studies, a schematic diagram is presented that summarizes the evolution of Intermountain West snowstorms featuring an intrusion of low-theta(e) air aloft ahead of a surface cold front. Implications for short-range quantitative precipitation forecasting and seasonal-to-annual hydrometeorological prediction are discussed.

Ecomorphological variation of pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus) in exposed littoral shoreline habitat of a postglacial lake	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												The spatial distribution of phenotypes across the environment has important consequences for population biology, community ecology, and evolution. Populations of pumpkinseed sunfish (Centrarchidae: Lepomis gibbosus) have repeatedly diversified between the littoral and pelagic habitats of postglacial lakes, but we know little about the natural history of pumpkinseed in exposed rocky littoral shorelines relative to those in sheltered littoral bays. We addressed three general questions with respect to the pumpkinseed found in exposed littoral shoreline relative to conspecifics from sheltered littoral and pelagic habitats: (1) What phenotype is associated with the exposed littoral shoreline? (2) What is their summer diet? (3) What is the condition of pumpkinseed from exposed littoral shorelines? Reference sheltered littoral and pelagic pumpkinseed were phenotypically and ecologically differentiated in a pattern consistent with several previous studies; pelagic pumpkinseed had deeper bodies, smaller jaws (narrower oral jaw width and shorter premaxilla), and a more terminal mouth, as well as having more zooplankton and less insects in their diet. Pumpkinseed from exposed shoreline habitat had jaw and body shape phenotypes, as well as diets, that were similar to sheltered littoral reference pumpkinseed in some traits while others were more intermediate. We found no evidence that differences between habitats in phenotype or diet translated into differences in body condition at the end of the summer growing season, suggesting that exposed littoral shorelines are unlikely to be an ecological 'sink' habitat. This study expands our understanding of the spatial distributions of polyphenic pumpkinseed, and their habitat use in postglacial lakes.																			0378-1909	1573-5133				FEB	2021	104	2					119	133		10.1007/s10641-021-01061-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-021-01061-3		FEB 2021											WOS:000614302100001
J	Abbasi, M				Abbasi, Mustafa			SAMAKH: THE RISE AND FALL OF A PALESTINIAN ARAB TOWN ON THE SHORES OF THE SEA OF GALILEE	HOLY LAND STUDIES												This article deals with the story of the rise and fall of Samakh. This town, which was founded by Algerian migrants at the end of the nineteenth century, quickly became one of the most prosperous towns in the Jordan valley. Its strategic location at the meeting point where the borders of Palestine, Jordan and Syria intersect, and its proximity to the water sources of Lake Tiberias and two rivers, gave it all the advantages of a transit town with its crossroads and train connections. The number of its inhabitants rose by the score up to about 4,000 towards the end of the Mandate period. The upsurge in growth and expansion of Samakh which continued until the war of 1948 constitutes a testimony for the processes of transformation and development that Galilee had enjoyed in those days. At the same time, the bitter end and destruction which that war brought upon the town testifies to the catastrophe suffered by the Arab population in this region.																			1474-9475					MAY	2013	12	1					91	108		10.3366/hls.2013.0061	http://dx.doi.org/10.3366/hls.2013.0061													WOS:000319182000006

Effect of temperature on zooplankton vertical migration velocity	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Zooplankton diel vertical migration (DVM) is an ecologically important process, affecting nutrient transport and trophic interactions. Available measurements of zooplankton displacement velocity during the DVM in the field are rare; therefore, it is not known which factors are key in driving this velocity. We measured the velocity of the migrating layer at sunset (upward bulk velocity) and sunrise (downwards velocity) in summer 2015 and 2016 in a lake using the backscatter strength (VBS) from an acoustic Doppler current profiler. We collected time series of temperature, relative change in light intensity chlorophyll-a concentration and zooplankton concentration. Our data show that upward velocities increased during the summer and were not enhanced by food, light intensity or by VBS, which is a proxy for zooplankton concentration and size. Upward velocities were strongly correlated with the water temperature in the migrating layer, suggesting that temperature could be a key factor controlling swimming activity. Downward velocities were constant, likely because Daphnia passively sink at sunrise, as suggested by our model of Daphnia sinking rate. Zooplankton migrations mediate trophic interactions and web food structure in pelagic ecosystems. An understanding of the potential environmental determinants of this behaviour is therefore essential to our knowledge of ecosystem functioning.

J	MOORE, WG				MOORE, WG			LIMNOLOGICAL STUDIES OF LOUISIANA LAKES .1. LAKE PROVIDENCE	ECOLOGY												Periodic observations were carried on at L.Providence, an old riverlake in n.e. La., over a period of 15 mos. The lake has an area of 1380 acres and a max. depth of 40 ft. One period of stratification from May or June through Sept. and one period of continuous circulation from Oct. through April constitutes the normal annual thermal cycle. High dissolved oxygen tensions, frequently exceeding saturation, characterize the epilimnion during the summer stratification period; dissolved oxygen deficiencies, including complete depletion, are found in the lower thermocline and hypolimnion at this time. Plant life is largely restricted to plankton algae, especially the very abundant Myxophyceae. Zooplankton is scanty, the predominant group being the Rotifera. The summer standing crop of benthos averaged 90.4 lbs. per acre, drained wet wt. Extensive postsummer fish mortality reported in past yrs. at this lake is probably attributable to decomposition of the algae bloom.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1950	31	1					86	99		10.2307/1931363	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1931363													WOS:A1950XW60100009

Simulating the influence of microclimatic design on mitigating the Urban Heat Island effect in the Hangzhou Metropolitan Area of China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOW-CARBON TECHNOLOGIES												There are many indications that Urban Heat Island (UHI) is a significant contributor to the increased emission of greenhouse gases due to the increase in energy consumption for cooling during summer. Hangzhou is currently the second hottest city in China, and this paper investigates how the West Lake and the Xixi Wetland areas in the city act as passive thermal comfort systems in improving the outdoor built environment and mitigating UHI effect. Through using ENVI-met, this research evaluates the most effective development scenarios of West Lake and Xixi Wetland area for reliving UHI effect. The energy consumptions for cooling in a typical office building located close to the West Lake and Xixi Wetland under different development scenarios of these two ecological resources are then also compared. It was shown that the average atmosphere temperature and urban heat intensity in urban area increased by more than 0.5 degrees C if the West Lake and Xixi Wetland are both transformed to building construction areas. Moreover, the cooling demand of a typical office building in summer would increase by 10.8% due to ambient temperature increasing by 0.5 degrees C.

J	Lampman, GG; Makarewicz, JC				Lampman, GG; Makarewicz, JC			The phytoplankton zooplankton link in the Lake Ontario food web	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Monitoring in Lake Ontario in 1970 and 1982 demonstrated that the zooplankton community was dominated by microzooplankton, which suggested a longer, perhaps inefficient food chain. In this study, annual monitoring of the offshore region of lab Ontario between 1986 and 1992 was used to determine if microzooplankton were still dominant despite recent changes in nutrient loading and species introductions. Microzooplankton accounted for 49.7% of the total summer zooplankton biomass while small edible phytoplankton accounted for 67.0% of the biomass during the summer. By direct in situ measurement using a Haney grazing chamber, rather than size grazing relationships, the relative impact of micro- and mesozooplankton grazers on phytoplankton production during the summer of 1995 was evaluated. Microzooplankton filtration rates (%/d) for 1995 were significantly higher than mesozooplankton filtration rates. Zooplankton consumed only 17.5% /d of the primary production with microzooplankton grazing representing 69.8% to 93.2% of this amount. Microzooplankton are clearly still dominant and their consumption of primary production in Lake Ontario is low. The major pathway of energy transfer can not be through the classical phytoplankton > large zooplankton > planktivore > piscivore food chain but rather through the phytoplankton > microzooplankton and presumably predacious zooplankton and fish. The longer food chain is a result of the introduction of a size-selective planktivore, the alewive, which has decreased the length and presumably lowered the consumption rate of the entire zooplankton community. This structural impact, a longer food chain, theoretically creates a higher factor of biomagnification of organic chemicals for top-level predators along with lower rates of energy transfer within the food web and suggests lower fish production than in a shorter food web.																			0380-1330						1999	25	2					239	249		10.1016/S0380-1330(99)70733-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(99)70733-1													WOS:000081807600002
J	Leonard, E				Leonard, Eric			Modeled patterns of Late Pleistocene glacier inception and growth in the Southern and Central Rocky Mountains, USA: sensitivity to climate change and paleoclimatic implications	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												High-resolution modern climate data for the Southern and Central Rocky Mountains provide a starting point for analysis of climate changes necessary to produce regional Late Pleistocene glaciation. A GIS-based model was used to assess the sensitivity of glaciation in different ranges to climatic change and the combinations of temperature and precipitation change necessary to sustain the last glacial maximum (LGM) extent of glaciation in each range. Extensive glaciation initiates first in the Wind River Range of Wyoming under every climate change scenario tested. In absence of precipitation change a summer temperature depression of 6-8 degrees C would be necessary to maintain LGM ice extents in Colorado and Wyoming. If precipitation was halved, necessary summer temperature depression would be 8-10 degrees C; if precipitation was doubled, a depression of 3.5-5.5 degrees C would suffice. Given model uncertainties, these values may underestimate necessary temperature depression by as much as 2 C. Under all scenarios tested, LGM glaciation in Utah, particularly the Wasatch Range, requires either more temperature depression for given precipitation change, or more precipitation for a given temperature depression than is required in the Colorado/Wyoming Rockies. A summer temperature depression of 7 degrees C, which would suffice to sustain LGM ice extent with little change from modern precipitation in the Colorado/Wyoming Rockies, would need to be coupled with a near doubling of precipitation to maintain LGM ice extent in the Wasatch Range. This difference appears to reflect LGM precipitation enhancement in the Wasatch Range, and to a lesser degree the Uinta Mountains, resulting from the presence of Lake Bonneville immediately upwind of these ranges.

Five outcrops from Huangqihai Lake in northern China were investigated to reconstruct the lake level fluctuations during the late Pleistocene and Holocene. A chronological framework ranging from similar to 34 to similar to 8 ka was established by pulsed optically stimulated luminescence dating using sand-sized quartz and by radiocarbon dating techniques. The chronological and geological evidence demonstrates that the lake level of Huangqihai reached a peak elevation of similar to 1340m [>77m above the present lake level (a.p.l.l)] during the early Holocene. Such highstand was sustained from similar to 10 to similar to 8 ka and retreated towards the middle and late Holocene. Between similar to 50 and similar to 11 ka, aeolian and fluvial deposition prevailed around the lake basin and no lake sediment was found above 1277m (similar to 14m a.p.l.l.), demonstrating a low lake level during this interval compared with that of the early Holocene.

Using a simple 2D steady-state saturated flow and reactive transport model to elucidate denitrification patterns in a hillslope aquifer	19TH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION (MODSIM2011)					19th International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM)	DEC 12-16, 2011	Perth, AUSTRALIA	CSIRO, Australian Govt, Bur Meteorol, Per Convent & Exhibit Ctr, Perth Convent Bur, Curtin Univ, Australian Math Soc (Aust MS), Australian & New Zealand Ind & Appl Math (ANZIAM), Australian Math Sci Inst (AMSI), Maralte Publishers, Econ Soc Australian (ESA), HEMA Consulting, Simulat Australia, Stat Soc Australia Inc (SSAI), Modelling & Simulat Soc Australia & New Zealand Inc (MSSANZ), Int Assoc Math & Comp Simulat (IMACS)				In the last 50 years, agricultural intensification has resulted in increasing nutrient losses that threaten the health of the lakes on the volcanic plateau of New Zealand's North Island. As part of our efforts to understand the transport and transformations of nitrogen in this landscape, the 2D vertical groundwater transport model AquiferSim 2DV was used to simulate water flow, nitrate transport, denitrification, and discharge to surface waters in a hillslope adjacent to a wetland and stream discharging into Lake Taupo, Australasia's largest lake. AquiferSim 2DV is a steady state model using the finite-difference stream function method for flow modelling and finite-volume mixing cell method for contaminant transport modelling. The ratio of horizontal to vertical hydraulic conductivity must be specified within the aquifer domain, as must effective porosity and denitrification rates. Boundary conditions consist of recharge fluxes and contaminant concentrations, as well as the assumed zone of discharge. Hydrodynamic dispersion is simulated through numerical dispersion, which depends on grid resolution. Denitrification reactions within each computational cell may include both zero-order and first-order rates. All parameters may be spatially heterogeneous. Previous applications of this model have been to essentially horizontal aquifer systems. By contrast, this hillslope system has sloping material layers and a dynamic and sloping water table. Extensions were made to AquiferSim 2DV, including representation of converging/diverging flow, which allowed a 2D steady-state model of this system to be developed. Comparison of model predictions with detailed water level and hydrochemical data from the site, however, showed that the model's attractive simplicity in this case precluded adequate characterisation of what is essentially a 3D, transient system. While the model produced reasonable agreement with the concentration patterns under an average water table profile, predictions of oxygen and nitrate concentrations under low summer and high spring water table conditions were poor. The seasonal changes reflected an annual recharge pulse of fresh, oxidised water followed by gradual oxygen depletion till the next recharge pulse occurs in the following year, an essentially transient phenomenon which could not be represented using a steady state model. This in itself has provoked fresh thinking about the dynamic nature of flow and chemistry at the site.

J	Ainsworth, AM; Goulder, R				Ainsworth, AM; Goulder, R			Microbial organic-nitrogen transformations along the Swale-Ouse river system, Northern England	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Organic-nitrogen transformations (extracellular aminopeptidase activity and bacterial assimilation of amino acids) were measured in river water, at 1 or 2-monthly intervals from May 1995 to May 1996, at six sites along 148 km of the Swale-Ouse and at sites on two tributaries, the River Wiske and Cod Beck. The aminopeptidase activity and amino-acid assimilation increased with distance downstream, as did bacterioplankton and phytoplankton chlorophyll a. These were usually straight-line increases rather than being stepwise in immediate response to sewage-works discharges. Rates of downstream increase, per unit length of river, were greatest in summer. Aminopeptidase activity and amino-acid assimilation varied seasonally, with highest values in summer. Correlation coefficients and forced-entry multiple-regression analysis suggested that organic-nitrogen transformations were potentially controlled by both microbial abundance and environmental variables, especially temperature and flow. The inorganic nitrogen regime apparently had little effect. The ratios, V-max for aminopeptidase activity/V-max for amino-acid uptake, and turnover rate for aminopeptidase activity/turnover rate for amino-acid assimilation, were used as indicators of the balance between supply and demand of organic nitrogen to bacterioplankton. Low values of these ratios, potentially indicating limited supply of amino-acid nitrogen, were recorded at the more downstream sites in the summer months. Since, however, ammonium-N was abundant at the downstream sites, there might have been a switch, with change in distance downstream and season, in the relative importance of amino acids and ammonium as nitrogen source. The specific growth rate (SGR) of planktonic bacteria from upstream sites increased with addition of leucine or glucose, thus organic nitrogen or carbon may have been limiting. For a downstream site, however, only leucine promoted increased SGR, hence organic-N might have been limiting. Addition of NH4-N did not increase SGR hence inorganic nitrogen appeared not to be of equal value to bacterioplankton. Rates of organic-nitrogen transformations in the River Wiske and Cod Beck resembled those in the middle and lower main river, as did bacterioplankton and phytoplankton abundance, inorganic-nitrogen concentrations and the composition of the aquatic macrophyte community. Thus, these tributaries, although they were small watercourses, were very different from the headstream of the main river, essentially being enriched lowland streams.

The study also included an analysis of functional feeding groups (FFG) and the influence of environmental parameters on the chironomid community. Within macrophyte stands at three sites, the chironomids were very abundant and the recorded larvae belonged to three subfamilies: Chironominae (Chironomini and Tanytarsini), Orthocladiinae and Tanypodinae. Endochironomus albipennis type was the dominant species with high abundance in July and September and lower abundance in August, most likely due to summer emergence. At the beginning of the sampling season, high abundance was recorded for Cricotopus sylvestris type as well. The secondary colonizers, Polypedilum sordens type, Glyptotendipens pallens type and Parachironomus varus type, displayed an increase in abundance towards the end of the season. ANOSIM analysis indicated significant differences in chironomid abundance between samples from July and September as a result of the higher abundance of Chironomini larvae in September. Active filterers, detritivores and predators were more abundant in September as compared to the other two months, while grazer abundance decreased towards the end of the study period. ANOSIM analysis separated August and September based on the abundance of different functional feeding groups (FFG). We found no significant differences between research stations for either chironomid abundance or FFG. BIO-ENV analysis indicated an influence of environmental variables, especially water temperature, Secchi depth and oxygen concentration on chironomid abundance.

Does the creation of a boreal hydroelectric reservoir result in a net change in evaporation?	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Estimates of water consumption from hydroelectricity production are hampered by a lack of common methodological approaches. Studies typically use gross evaporation estimates which do not take into account the evaporative water loss from the pre-flooded ecosystems that would occur without the presence of a reservoir. We evaluate the net change in evaporation following the creation of a hydroelectric reservoir located in the Canadian boreal region. We use a direct measurement technique (eddy covariance) over four different ecosystems to evaluate the pre- and post-flood landscape water flux over a five-year period. The net effect of reservoir creation was to increase evaporation over that of the pre-flooded ecosystem. This change was dependent both on management and differences in the timing of the evaporation with nighttime and autumn contributing strongly to the reservoir evaporation. Managed reduction of water level, and thus the evaporating area, reduced the evaporation. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The peat physicochemical data including total organic carbon (TOC), trace elements, and grain-size show that the site has changed from a lake during the cold-wet Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 20,000-18,000 cal yr BP), to a marshy wetland during the mild last deglaciation (18,000-11,500 cal yr BP) and a peatland during the mostly warm and dry Holocene (11,500 cal yr BP-present). This general sequence corresponds with changes in East Asian monsoon indicated by stalagmites delta O-18 records and boreal summer insolation. Marked decreases in trace element concentrations correspond to two periods of peatland expansion during the abrupt hydroclimatic transitions from the LGM to the last deglaciation and from the last deglaciation to the early Holocene. Warm-dry mid-Holocene might induce high organic matter decomposition in peat sediments. Increasing natural element concentrations since the late Holocene are correlated with the weakening of the summer monsoon and elevated atmospheric dust deposition. Increasing Cu and Pb concentrations in peat record indicate large-scale Cu smelting during the Bronze Age and excessive coal burning during the 10th century or so. The anthropogenic heavy metals were transported by prevailing East Asian summer monsoon and deposited in the Dajiuhu Basin during periods of heightened human activities. Our compilation of heavy metals records across China confirmed the noticeable impacts of the historical human activity on deposition environments during the late Holocene. consequently, trace elements from the Dajiuhu Basin are reliable proxies for capturing monsoon climate-induced peatland deposition response and present important evidence for a historical atmospheric heavy metal pollution in the Middle Yangtze Valley. Our results offer useful references for peatland evolution and protection under the background of global change. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, it is unclear whether such remobilization occurs in shallow lakes, where concentrations of dissolved oxygen in the hypolimnion (bottom DO) change temporally in response to meteorological conditions, and whether remobilized radiocesium influences the activity in fish. We examined the seasonal dynamics of the activities of dissolved Cs-137 and Cs-137 in fish (pond smelt and crucian carp) from Lake Kasumigaura, a shallow, hypereutrophic lake, five years after the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident. The activities of both dissolved Cs-137 and Cs-137 in fish declined during that time, but the declines showed a clear seasonal pattern that included a summer peak of Cs-137 activity. The activity of dissolved Cs-137 increased when the bottom DO concentration decreased, and a nonlinear causality test revealed significant causal forcing of dissolved Cs-137 activity by bottom DO. The fact that NH4-N concentrations in bottom waters were higher in the summer suggested that remobilization of Cs-137 from sediments could result from highly selective ion-exchange with NH4-N. Despite the shallow depth of Lake Kasumigaura, winds had little influence bottom DO concentrations or dissolved Cs-137 activities. The fact that seasonal means of Cs-137 activities in pond smelt and crucian carp were positively correlated with the seasonal means of dissolved Cs-137 activities suggested that remobilized Cs-137 may have influenced the seasonal dynamics of radiocesium in fish through food-chain transfer, but higher feeding rates in warm water could may have also contributed to the seasonal dynamics of Cs-137 activity in fish. Our findings suggest that in shallow lakes, intermittent but repeated hypoxic events may enhance remobilization of radiocesium from sediments, and remobilized radiocesium may contributed to long-term retention of radiocesium in aquatic organisms.

J	Dubois, JP; Gillet, C; Hilgert, N; Balvay, G				Dubois, Jean-Paul; Gillet, Christian; Hilgert, Nadine; Balvay, Gerard			The impact of trophic changes over 45 years on the Eurasian perch, Perca fluviatilis, population of Lake Geneva	AQUATIC LIVING RESOURCES												The change in catches and mean size of one-year-old perch ( Perca fluviatilis) in Lake Geneva was studied between 1957 and 2005, and related to trophic changes and average temperature. The status of Lake Geneva, assessed on the basis of total phosphorus concentrations, switched from being oligotrophic before 1960 to eutrophic, with total phosphorus concentration reaching nearly 90 mu g L-1 in 1976-1979. In response to management measures, the trophic status then returned to mesotrophy in the early 2000s. Zooplankton is the main food consumed by young perch, and quantities present ( annual biovolumes of zooplankton) were recorded throughout the study period. The lake water temperature was also recorded. Data obtained from perch catches and perch spawns enabled eleven strong cohorts of perch to be identified. Strong cohorts dominated the stock for three years, until they were massively caught by fishermen. Yields have fluctuated widely, increasing rapidly until 1975, and subsequently decreasing, with an exceptional decline between 1976 and 1981. During the period 1977-1981, unfavourable climatic conditions in spring were probably the main cause of this fall in perch yields. For the other periods, perch yields and the mean size of one-year-old perch were significantly correlated with trophic parameters, total phosphorus concentration and zooplankton biovolume. Correlations are higher if only strong cohorts are taken into account. As a result of the re-oligotrophication process, perch growth has been progressively reduced, age at first maturity delayed and strong cohorts become less frequent; the mean size of 0+ individuals in strong cohorts is significantly smaller than in the other cohorts, suggesting a population density effect in the context of a limited supply of zooplankton. During the study period, trophic changes in Lake Geneva have had more impact on perch growth and yield than has temperature, since no significant correlation could be detected between water temperature and perch growth.																			0990-7440	1765-2952				OCT-DEC	2008	21	4					401	410		10.1051/alr:2008051	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/alr:2008051													WOS:000261431900007

Lateral Carbon Exports From Drained Peatlands: An Understudied Carbon Pathway in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, California	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Degradation of peatlands via drainage is increasing globally and destabilizing peat carbon (C) stores. The effects of drainage on the timing and magnitude of lateral C losses from degraded peatlands remains understudied. We measured spatial and temporal variability in lateral C exports from three drained peat islands in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta in California across the 2017 and 2018 water years using measurements of dissolved inorganic C (DIC), dissolved organic C (DOC), and suspended particulate organic C (POC) concentration combined with discharge. These measurements were supplemented with stable isotope data (delta C-13-DIC, delta C-13-POC, delta N-15-PON, and delta H-2-H2O values) to provide insight into hydrological and biogeochemical controls on lateral C exports from drained peatlands. Drainage DOC and DIC concentrations were seasonally variable with the highest values in the winter rainy season, when discharge was also elevated. Seasonal differences in the mobilization of dissolved C appeared to result from changing water sources and water table levels. Peat island drainage C contributions to surrounding waterways were also greatest during the winter. Although temporal variability in C cycling processes and trends were generally similar across islands, baseline drainage DIC, DOC, and POC concentrations were spatially variable, likely a result of sub-island-scale differences in soil organic matter content and hydrology. This spatial variability complicates system-wide assessments of C budgets. Net lateral C exports were water year dependent and comparable to previously published vertical C emission rates for this system. This work highlights the importance of including lateral C exports from drained peatlands in local and regional C budgets.

Interacting impacts of hydrological changes and air temperature warming on lake temperatures highlight the potential for adaptive management	AMBIO												Globally, climate warming is increasing air temperatures and changing river flows, but few studies have explicitly considered the consequences for lake temperatures of these dual effects, or the potential to manage lake inflows to mitigate climate warming impacts. Using a one-dimensional model, we tested the sensitivity of lake temperatures to the separate and interacting effects of changes in air temperature and inflow on a small, short-residence time (annual average approximate to 20 days), temperate lake. Reducing inflow by 70% increased summer lake surface temperatures 1.0-1.2 degrees C and water column stability by 11-19%, equivalent to the effect of 1.2 degrees C air temperature warming. Conversely, similar increases in inflow could result in lake summer cooling, sufficient to mitigate 0.75 degrees C air temperature rise, increasing to more than 1.1 degrees C if inflow temperature does not rise. We discuss how altering lake inflow volume and temperature could be added to the suite of adaptation measures for lakes.					; Jones, Ian/AAE-8193-2022; Olsson, Freya/MGV-1025-2025; Spears, Bryan/I-3688-2012; Mackay, Eleanor/F-5490-2013; Barker, Philip/J-5938-2012	Barker, Philip/0000-0002-5334-9201; Olsson, Freya/0000-0002-0483-4489; Mackay, Eleanor/0000-0001-5697-7062; 													0044-7447	1654-7209				MAR	2025	54	3			SI		402	415		10.1007/s13280-024-02015-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-024-02015-6		MAY 2024						38795283					WOS:001235759300002

Our objectives were to determine whether the tracked fish were seasonal or year-round residents of the river and to determine their seasonal movements, responses to changes in discharge, and activity centers We were also interested in the response of these fish to the removal of a hydroelectric dam that had blocked upstream movement of fish for 87 years. Eight fish received transmitter implants anti were tracked for about 7 months, from October 1994 through May 1995, Three tagged fish were not identified or located thereafter, but the remaining five were tracked weekly from April 1995 to September 1996. Lake Sturgeon did not move upstream of the former hydroelectric clam or do downstream of the Kettle River's confluence with the St. Croix River but rather remained within this 20-mi reach, despite the absence of physical barriers at either end. We found that sturgeon movement was highly correlated with change in discharge. with upstream movements occuring during periods of rising discharge and downstream movements during falling discharge, Lake sturgeon used activity centers, with approximately 80% of the weekly daytime observations falling within four activity centers. Using mark-recapture techniques. we also documented that the lake sturgeon population in the Kettle River is small, and it appeared to mix very little with adjacent populations. We believe that if this population does mix with other nearby populations. mixing probably occurs on a time scale of years rather than weeks or months.					frank, joseph/AAJ-6680-2020														0275-5947	1548-8675				AUG	2002	22	3					888	894		10.1577/1548-8675(2002)022<0888:EOAYRR>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8675(2002)022<0888:EOAYRR>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000177486800019
J	Wang, HS; Mullens, E				Wang, Hongsheng; Mullens, Esther			Role of single and compound Pacific natural variability in extratropical cyclone activity over North America	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												The role of large-scale natural variability in influencing the distribution of midlatitude storm tracks and extratropical cyclones is well known. However, less understood is how compound natural variability-the concurrence of two modes of variability-influences the geospatial characteristics of extratropical cyclones. Here, we evaluate compound modes of Pacific-North American variability-ENSO and PNA with the slow varying PDO-on extratropical cyclones over the North American region during 1950-2013, using an automated tracking algorithm applied to the Twentieth Century Reanalysis version 3 data. Seasonal analysis is conducted on spatial statistics including track, genesis and lysis density and some mean fields in varying compound phases. Spatial correlations of track density with seasonal mean of individual variability indices show that the PNA, ENSO and PDO enhance cyclone activity over Pacific storm track significantly while shifting the North American and Atlantic storm tracks in seasons, that is, equatorward in the positive phase. But the decadal variability of PDO moves the Atlantic storm track poleward, particularly in boreal winter. By comparing to the single Pacific variability impacts, compound Pacific variability results demonstrate the dominance of the higher-frequency modes of ENSO and PNA on extratropical cyclone activity, while the slow varying PDO can modulate the ENSO- and PNA-related cyclone variability. For example, during a negative PNA, cyclones over the North Atlantic become more (less) frequent during a positive (negative) PDO. The in-phase modes of the PDO and ENSO influence Pacific storm track significantly, increasing (decreasing) cyclone frequency when both are positive (negative) in boreal winter. Results are linked to and used to explain the previous findings on how natural variability influences the occurrence of tornado outbreaks and high precipitation over the southeastern United States, Great Lakes, Ohio Valley and other US regions. Understanding compound variability modulations may be useful to predict extratropical cyclone frequency, development and decay regions seasonally and to study the physical mechanisms of extreme weather events. Extratropical cyclones, high-impact weather systems, are modulated geospatially and temporally by large-scale natural variability. This study examines the teleconnection roles in single and compound phases, including the ENSO, PNA and PDO in shifting storm track, affecting cyclone frequency, formation and decay regions within the North America, Pacific and Atlantic.image						Mullens, Esther/0000-0002-4370-6375; Wang, Hongsheng/0000-0001-5116-0037													0899-8418	1097-0088				FEB	2024	44	2					647	667		10.1002/joc.8349	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/joc.8349		JAN 2024											WOS:001138038400001
J	Hu, HY; Mylon, SE; Benoit, G				Hu, Haiying; Mylon, Steven E.; Benoit, Gaboury			Volatile organic sulfur compounds in a stratified lake	CHEMOSPHERE												Three volatile organic sulfur compounds (VOSCs), dimethyl sulfide (DMS), carbon disulfide (CS2), and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), were detected in the stratified water column of a lake (Linsley Pond) in Connecticut. The compounds DMS and DMDS appeared in both the oxic and the anoxic portions of the water column, CS2 was primarily found in anoxic hypolimnion. Algal metabolism and/or bacterial degradation of sulfur-containing amino acids or other organic materials are potential sources of VOSCs in the oxic lake water. Reactions of hydrogen sulfide with organic compounds and microbial degradation of organic matter may be responsible for the production of VOSCs in the anoxic lake water. The vertical distribution patterns of these three VOSCs varied from month to month in the summer, but the daily profiles obtained in one 5-day period in the summer displayed consistency. No clear diurnal pattern for any of the three VOSCs was observed. Based on observation that these VOSCs were not present in surface and near surface waters of Linsley Pond, freshwater inputs of reduced sulfur compounds to the atmosphere may be insignificant.

Today R. haematites calcifies only in freshwater environments but these Gulf of Corinth bioherms have a brackish affinity, limited areal extent, and occur within marine deposits. Field relations and preliminary U-series dating suggest a marine isotope stage (MIS) 5e age for the bioherms. This age is compatible with published MIS 5e ages for corals in the marine sediments above the bioherms and is consistent with their current elevation based on average uplift rates. Bioherm growth during MIS 5e constrains their formation during a time of near sea-level highstand when the Gulf of Corinth was marine. Growth cavities in the bioherms are encrusted by brackish tolerant coralline algae. Field mapping of the MIS 5e highstand palaeoshoreline shows the bioherms grew in water < 16 m deep. Mg contents of the bioherm calcites, and associated coralline algal skeletons, are both much lower than expected for marine MIS 5e carbonates. They are best explained if the calcites precipitated from brackish fluids with Mg/Ca ratios below 2, implying at least 60% input of freshwater with low Mg/Ca ratio. Sr isotopes confirm a strong input of groundwater that had partially equilibrated with Mesozoic limestones. The limited areal extent of the bioherms and their close association with karstified fault scarps suggest that they formed in shallow sea water where freshwater submarine springs delivered CaCO3 saturated water that promoted rapid calcification of cyanobacteria. Rapid calcification and strong degassing of CO2 from the spring water resulted in disequilibrium stable isotope compositions for the calcites.

J	Russell, IA; Randall, RM; Zimmerman, D; Govender, D				Russell, Ian A.; Randall, Rodney M.; Zimmerman, David; Govender, Danny			Outbreak of avian botulism and its effect on waterbirds in the Wilderness Lakes, South Africa	KOEDOE												Avian botulism has been reported in many areas worldwide, particularly in North America, where at times it has resulted in die-offs of hundreds of thousands of waterbirds. By contrast, there are few reported cases in wild waterbird communities in South Africa. Mass die-offs of waterbirds in the Wilderness Lakes, South Africa, were first observed in January 2015, raising concerns about the effect of disease on the status of waterbird communities in this Ramsar site. Surveys of bird carcasses were undertaken between 2015 and 2017. An estimated 1115 individuals from 23 species were affected, with sick individuals displaying symptoms of avian type C, C and D or E botulism. The highest mortality was amongst red-knobbed coot (Fulica cristata), Cape shoveler (Anas smithii) and yellow-billed duck (Anas undulata), respectively comprising 60%, 18% and 9% of affected individuals. Cape shoveler was found to be particularly susceptible to the disease. Deaths occurred mainly during summer and autumn (November-April). No mortalities were recorded amongst 44 waterbird species, of which common moorhen (Gallinula choropus), African purple swamphen (Porphyrio madagascariensis) and reed cormorant (Phalacrocorax africanus) are widespread and abundant. The reasons for the outbreaks remain elusive, as environmental changes characteristic of a botulism outbreak, notably a decline in water level and dissolved oxygen, did not differ substantially from earlier years when no disease outbreaks were observed. The role of fish, and in particular the recently introduced common carp (Cyprinus carpio) in the progression of the disease, remains speculative, although worthy of investigation. The removal of carcasses for disease control should be continued. Conservation implications: The long-term effect of repeated outbreaks of avian botulism on the abundance of susceptible waterbird species in the Wilderness Lakes is of concern. The previous regular high abundance of duck species, particularly yellow-billed duck and Cape shoveler, was the initial reason for the Wilderness Lakes being declared a Ramsar site. The effect of ongoing high disease-related mortalities may, in part, prevent these wetlands from continuing to regularly support globally significant populations of some waterbird species. The containment of the disease must be attempted by the regular collection and removal of dead birds and fish during the outbreak periods of November-June, and carcasses should be disposed of off-site. Further testing of affected individuals should be undertaken and the monitoring of environmental variables and affected individuals continued to improve the understanding of the drivers and progression of the disease.					; Govender, Danny/AFL-9589-2022	Randall, Rodney/0000-0001-8742-2828; Govender, Danny/0000-0002-1306-907X; Zimmermann, David/0000-0002-1742-5510													0075-6458	2071-0771				OCT 31	2019	61	1							a1553	10.4102/koedoe.v61i1.1553	http://dx.doi.org/10.4102/koedoe.v61i1.1553													WOS:000496806300001

In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of 8 13 C carb and 8 18 O carb records from Lake Chagan in the Otindag Sandy Land, located in North China, spanning approximately 7000 years. Our aim is to explore how the lacustrine inorganic carbon cycle responded to both climate change and human activity. The findings reveal a notable highstand in Lake Chagan around 6.9 -6.0 cal kyr BP, followed by a gradual regression leading to an unstable state over the past 1.6 cal kyr BP. The hydroclimate variations inferred from Lake Chagan align with other regional records, suggesting that long-term East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) precipitation trends were influenced by decreasing insolation and variations in solar irradiance on a centennial timescale. The sources of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in lake water generally mirrored regional hydroclimate changes since the middle Holocene. Our evidence indicates that during periods of strong EASM activity, more allochthonous organic matter was converted to lake water DIC, coinciding with high vegetation cover and intense soil erosion. While hydroclimatic changes significantly impacted the lacustrine carbon cycle, the isotopic evidence also suggests substantial anthropogenic influences post -1.6 cal kyr BP, particularly in terms of the input of allochthonous organic matter into the lakes of the Otindag Sandy Land. These findings underscore the potential for anthropogenic-driven terrestrial carbon cycle feedback to global climate change over millennia.					sun, weiwei/GQG-8925-2022														0031-0182	1872-616X				SEP 1	2024	649								112299	10.1016/j.palaeo.2024.112299	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2024.112299		JUN 2024											WOS:001256741600001

In the outlet stream of Lake Pitt in the Lower Laurentians Of Quebec, near the southern edge of its range, the species has a univoltine cycle. The adults emerged in late April and early May. The eggs, however, did not hatch till September and the first nymphs were collected in October. Growth continued throughout the winter and ended just before the emergence period. Though a wide range of sizes was present during the winter, there was a resynchronisation of the population before emergence and a short emergence period due to rapid growth of the smaller nymphs. Mature female nymphs were larger than males. The significance of the embryonic diapause in this northern species is discussed.																			0008-4301	1480-3283				OCT	1993	71	10					2136	2139		10.1139/z93-299	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z93-299													WOS:A1993MJ08000025

The urban landscape water, an artificial lake of approximately 326 m(2), was supplied with reclaimed water during a six-month experiment. Results indicated that the concentrations of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in the SFB zone (SFBZ) were significantly lower than those in the control zone (CZ) and the FB zone (FBZ) after six months of operation. The average removal efficiencies (AREs) in the SFBZ, FBZ and CZ were 89.98%, 77.39% and 56.37%, respectively, for ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N); 92.49%, 79.55% and 47.85%, respectively, for phosphate (PO43--P). Meanwhile, the average concentration of Chlorophyll a and the algae density in SFBZ during the experiment were 12.54 mu g/L and 1.31 x 10(4) cells/mL, which were lower, obviously, than those in the FBZ and CZ. Moreover, the contribution rates analysis of nutrient removal exhibited that the plant absorption in the removal of N and P occupied 27.85% and 26.36%, whereas the filler adsorption occupied 7.93% and 11.93%, respectively, in the SFB. Thus, the water quality of the artificial lake was improved greatly by the SFB which hybridized fillers and FB together. Finally, it was found that the AREs of NH4+-N and PO43--P in the SFBZ could reach 73.93% and 84.56%, approximately 1.39 and 1.41 times that of the FBZ during the winter. Therefore, the application of an SFB can keep a stable water quality in urban landscape water and avoid the lower removal rate of an FB at low-temperature. In summary, the SFB could effectively improve the water quality of urban landscape water supplied with reclaimed water even in winter. (c) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

In these cases, the landscape is important to the patterns of damaging coldest temperatures, as well as to growing season conditions. Vineyard site selection is a priority in New York State and Ukraine to optimize current sites and identify acceptable new vineyard sites in regions with many unsuitably cold sites. Important environmental factors (climate, soil, topography, etc.) that influence grapevine winter injury and survival, development, and fruit quality, were integrated to define micro zones for quality wine production in Ukraine, based on landscape and ecosystem studies. For New York State, an online GIS-based vineyard site evaluation system was created (http://www.nyvineyardsite.org) to provide basic site information for site decision support. It includes information on soil suitability data, climatic and topography parameters. Site suitability maps for groups of grape cultivars and species are being developed based on varying climate and landscape requirements. Additionally, relationships of topography to temperature patterns in vineyards of the Finger Lakes region were modeled to estimate the warming "lake effect" that is noted in the winter. A temperature database was collected on the local vineyard scale with temperature sensors. The system represents a valuable tool that helps vine growers of New York State in the decision-making process choosing a vineyard site.																			0567-7572		978-94-62610-58-3				2015	1068						141	146		10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1068.17	http://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1068.17													WOS:000358012400017
J	An, KG; Park, SS				An, KG; Park, SS			Indirect influence of the summer monsoon on chlorophyll - total phosphorus models in reservoirs: a case study	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												This study examines how the Asian monsoon influences relationships between chlorophyll-a (Chl) and total phosphorus (TP), by means of a case study on Taechung Reservoir, Korea. A log-log regression model of Chl vs. TP was found to be quadratic relations, with Chl approaching an asymptote above 50 mug l(-1) TP. This is similar to the pattern previously reported for temperate lakes in Europe and North America. However. viewing the data by season, a highly significant linear model was obtained during the pre- and post-monsoon periods (R-2 > 0.83). but not during the summer monsoon (R-2 = 0.004). In the monsoon period, samples >50 mug l(-1) TP (23%, of the total observations) had fourfold lower Chl yields per unit TP (average = 0. 17) compared to samples from the same TP range in the other seasons (average = 0.76) and were strongly correlated (r = 0.97, n = 17) to non-volatile suspended solids (NVSS). Yield of Chl per unit TP also increased significantly (P < 0.05) in the mid- and down-lake zones, compared to the headwater zone. Residual analysis indicated that a water residence time (WRT) of < 8 days in the headwater zone had a significant antagonistic effect on Chl, perhaps due to light limitation caused by inorganic suspended solids. which exceeded 10 mg l(-1) during the monsoon. The result indicates that the seasonal monsoon can indirectly influence phytoplankton responses to nutrients, and should be taken into consideration in developing predictive eutrophication models in regions that experience this type of seasonal pattern.

The Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), a keystone species in north western aquatic ecosystems of North America, is profoundly affected by thermal regime changes in rivers, and it holds a pivotal role in ecological and economic contexts due to its life history, extensive distribution, and commercial fishery. In this study, we explore the effects of climate change on the thermal regime of the Nechako River (British Columbia, Canada), a relatively large river partially controlled by the Skins Lake Spillway. The CEQUEAU hydrological-thermal model was calibrated using discharge and water temperature observations. The model was forced using the Fifth generation of ECMWF Atmospheric Reanalysis data for the past and meteorological projections (downscaled and bias-corrected) from climate models for future scenarios. Hydrological calibration was completed for the 1980-2019 period using data from two hydrometric stations, and water temperature calibration was implemented using observations for 2005-2019 from eight water temperature stations. Changes in water temperature were assessed for two future periods (2040-2069 and 2070-2099) using eight Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 climate models and using two Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (4.5 and 8.5 W/m2 by 2100) for each period. Results show that water temperatures above 20 degrees C (an upper threshold for adequate thermal habitat for Sockeye salmon migration in this river) at the Vanderhoof station will increase in daily frequency. While the frequency of occurrence of this phenomenon is 1% (0-9 days/summer) based on 2005-2019 observations, this number range is 3.8-36% (0-62 days/summer) according to the ensemble of climate change scenarios. These results show the decreasing habitat availability for Sockeye salmon due to climate change and the importance of water management in addressing this issue.

Under this project, weekly samples of air were collected at four Canadian and two Russian arctic sites, namely Alert, Nunavut; Tagish, Yukon; Little Fox Lake, Yukon; Kinngait, Nunavut; Dunai Island, Russia and Amderma, Russia. Selected POPs, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine (OC) pesticides, were analyzed in both the gas and particulate phases. This paper summarizes results obtained from this project in the past 5 years. Temporal trends were developed for atmospheric PCBs and OCs observed at Alert using a digital filtration (DF) technique. It was found that trends developed with 5 years of data (1993-1997) did not differ significantly from those determined with 7 years of data (1993-1999). This implies that with the DF technique, long-term trends can still be developed with less than 10 years of data. An acceleration in decline of OC and PCB air concentrations was noted in 1999 for some compounds, although the reason is unknown. Monitoring efforts must continue to assess the effect of this decline on the long-term trends of POPs in the Canadian Arctic. Occasional high traits-/cis-chlordane ratios and heptachlor air concentrations measured at Alert between 1995 and 1997 suggests sporadic fresh usage of chlordane-based pesticides. However, significant decreasing trends of chlordanes along with their chemical signatures has provided evidence that emission of old soil residues is replacing new usage as an important source to the atmosphere. Measurements of OC air concentrations conducted at Kinngait in 1994-1995 and 2000-2001 indicated faster OC removal at this location than at Alert. This may be attributed to the proximity of Kinngait to temperate regions where both biotic and abiotic degradation rates are faster. The PAH concentrations observed at Alert mimic those at mid-latitudes and are consistent with long-range transport to the Arctic, particularly for the lighter PAHs. A decline in particulate PAH was observed, similar to atmospheric sulphate aerosol and can be attributed to the collapse of industrial activity in the former Soviet Union between 1991 and 1995. Spatial comparisons of OC seasonality at Alert, Tagish, Dunai and Kinngait show elevated air concentrations of some compounds in spring. However, elevated spring concentrations were observed for different compounds at different sites. Potential causes are discussed. Further investigation in the atmospheric flow pattern in spring which is responsible for the transport of POPs into the Arctic is required. OC and PCB air concentrations at Alert were found to be influenced by two climate variation patterns, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Pacific North American (PNA) pattern. Planetary atmospheric patterns must be taken into account in the global prediction and modelling of POPs in the future. Crown Copyright (c) 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V. All fights reserved.

Interannual variations in atmospheric forcing determine trajectories of hypolimnetic soluble reactive phosphorus supply in a eutrophic lake	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. We tested the hypotheses that variability in soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) loading from the hypolimnion to the epilimnion of a small, eutrophic, temperate zone lake is significant at both interannual and subannual scales, and that this variability is influenced by changes in lake thermal structure. We calculated weekly hypolimnetic fluxes of SRP, during the stratified periods of 2008 and 2009 in Esthwaite Water, U. K., and compared them with the SRP fluxes from external sources. 2. As a result of variations in the supply of SRP from the hypolimnion, which differed by c. 80% between years, we found a 30% difference in overall SRP loading to the epilimnion between the 2 years. Despite similarities in mean summer meteorological conditions, relatively subtle differences in weather conditions during the midsummer of only 0.7 m s(-1) in wind speed and 8 W m(-2) in solar radiation between the 2 years resulted in two diverging trajectories of hypolimnetic SRP loading. 3. In the first year, there was a high thermal lake stability of 102 J m(-2) on average, and a relatively shallow epilimnion until the late summer, giving rise to prolonged deep-water anoxia and a large accumulation of SRP that was mixed into the surface waters at the end of the summer. In contrast, 30% lower thermal stability and 20% deeper epilimnetic mixing in the second year resulted in the arrest and early decline of deep-water anoxia and SRP accumulation, leading to lower SRP fluxes to the epilimnion. 4. Understanding this meteorologically driven variability in SRP supply is crucial for predicting nutrient loading in lakes. It is likely to become especially relevant to lakes around the globe for which the importance of internal loading is predicted to increase due to the effects of climate change.

J	WELCH, EB; PATMONT, CR				WELCH, EB; PATMONT, CR			LAKE RESTORATION BY DILUTION - MOSES LAKE, WASHINGTON	WATER RESEARCH												Dilution water, low in macronutrients, was added to Moses Lake on 3 occasions in 1977 and once in 1978 during the spring-summer period. The addition resulted in reducing the annual average inflow concentration of P from about 130-140 .mu.g l-1 to 100 .mu.g l-1. The water exchange rate in Parker Horn, which is 8% of the lake volume, increased from about 1% day-1 normally to 7 and 11% day-1 for the May-Sept. period in 1977 and 1978, respectively. Lake water was displaced at a predictable rate in the whole lake and the areas proximal to the input, as verified by specific conductance. Improvements in lake quality, compared to values from 1969-1970, were rather good with greater reductions in algal biomass occurring than might have been expected to result from the less impressive reductions in total P content. Chlorophyll a [chl a] decreased by about 60-80% and total P decreased by about 50-60%, depending on the area of the lake. Chl a averaged only 15 .mu.g l-1 during May-Sept. 1978, while total P was rather high at 70-80 .mu.g l-1. The fraction of the phytoplankton composed by blue-green algae [Aphanizomenon] decreased from 96% in 1970 to 68% in 1977-1978. The cause for the effect on biomass and species composition is unknown, but may be related to dilution of blue-green excretory products. A dilution water input of about 6 m3 s-1 continuously during April-Sept. would require 20% less total water and should provide adequate control of eutrophication in at least 30% of the lake volume proximal to the input and Parker Horn. That would provide an exchange rate of 5% day-1 for Parker Horn and should achieve lake water residuals by midsummer of .ltoreq. 50%. Two additional inputs to the lake are also proposed as 2 more phases in the restoration project.																			0043-1354	1879-2448					1980	14	9					1317	1325		10.1016/0043-1354(80)90192-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(80)90192-X													WOS:A1980KF37800018

These loadings were compared with those estimated using intensive data measured onboard the R/V Lake Guardian in April 2002, September 2002, and July 2003 (each approximately one week). Measured concentrations and modeled mass transfer coefficients of elemental mercury (Hg-0), reactive gaseous mercury (RGM) and particulate mercury (Hg(,)) in air and total Hg in precipitation were incorporated into a total deposition model including wet deposition, air-water gas exchange and particle dry deposition. Urban/rural Hg concentration ratios were assumed based on literature values. Assuming that 10% of the lake was influenced by urban areas, the annual net Hg atmospheric loadings of wet deposition, net air-water gas exchange of Hg-0 (deposition = 300 kg yr(-1) and emission = 410 kg yr(-1)) and RGM, and Hg(p) dry deposition to Lake Ontario were estimated to be 170, -110, 68, and 20 kg, respectively, resulting in a net loading of 150 kg yr(-1). Net Hg loadings were largest in the fall (46 kg) and smallest in the summer (20 kg). Hg-0, wet, RGM and Hg(p) deposition contributed 55%, 30%, 12%, and 3.6% of the total Hg deposition, respectively. The net loading was found to be most sensitive to the assumed urban/rural concentration ratios, wind speed, DGM concentration and Hg-0 transfer velocity. An increase in the influence of urban areas from 0% to 30% resulted in a 90% increase in the total loading demonstrating the complexity and non-linearity of the atmospheric deposition of mercury to Lake Ontario and the importance of quantifying the urban footprint.

Use of synthetic aperture radar for selecting Alaskan lakes for winter water use	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Water resources are limited in many areas of the North Slope, Alaska, particularly during winter. Water is used by the oil industry for ice road construction and maintenance, drilling and facility operations, and potable water supplies. The coastal plain between Teshekpuk Lake, in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A) and the Colville River has numerous shallow lakes, but further south in the northern foothills of the Brooks Range, and east to the Canning River, lakes are fewer. While many oil and gas lease sales have been conducted, or are proposed, access to the leases may be limited because of the lack of available water for ice road construction. Ice roads are the main means by which exploration is conducted in the Arctic, putting a stress on freshwater bodies that do not freeze to the lakebed in winter. Lakes that do not freeze to the lakebed also serve as overwintering habitat for fish. The purpose of this paper is to report on the potential distribution of water bodies that may provide overwinter water in selected areas from Teshekpuk Lake to the Canning River. The project used synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery to search for the presence of water in lakes in March 2006. In the Kuparuk and Canning SAR images, 52 and 61% of lakes were frozen to their beds by March 2006, accounting for 49 and 57% of the lake area in these study regions. Conversely, only 2% of the lakes in the Teshekpuk region were frozen to the bottom by March 2006. Unfrozen water was more available because of deeper and more numerous lakes in the Teshekpuk Lake region (west) than in the Canning River area (east). While only specific SAR tiles were analyzed herein, the method will be a useful tool for land managers who seek to evaluate the potential for ice road construction across the Arctic.																			1093-474X	1752-1688				APR	2008	44	2					276	284		10.1111/j.1752-1688.2007.00160.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2007.00160.x													WOS:000254741500002

We analyzed simulations of three-selected Representative Concentration Pathways 8.5 Global Climate Models (GCM) (i.e. HadGEM2-ES, MPI-ESM-LR and GFDL-ESM2M). These GCMs which, were part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report, were selected as well performing GCMs that represent the historic climatology and prevailing precipitation bearing synoptic conditions in the southwest US. An analysis of both statistically and dynamically downscaled simulations projected increase in the frequency of dry winters during the mid-21st century (2020-2059) in two out of the three selected GCMs. For summer precipitation, the statistically downscaled simulations are inconclusive whereas, the dynamically downscaled simulations showed significant but contradicting future projections. In order to assess the impact of the projected climate on the hydrologic cycle at the Bill Williams River basins, we developed a modeling framework that includes the following components: 1) a weather generator that produces realizations of likely hourly precipitation events over the basin; 2) a hydrologic model that is based on the Colorado Basin River Forecast Center (CBRFC), National Weather Service modeling configuration that predicts flow at ten internal points and inflow into Alamo Lake; and 3) a lake model with the existing operation rules to simulates the lake outflow and levels. Using the above-described modeling framework, the impact of the projected mid 21-century climate on Alamo Lake was examined with respect to the total outflow from the dam, the frequency of large outflow events, and the frequency of high and low lake levels. The results show that dynamic downscaling provides a larger range of impacts than those provided by statistical downscaling. The results also indicate a wide range of impact scenarios with contradicting trends among the selected climate projections for mid-21st Century. These results imply increasing challenges in operating the Lake at its target level. This modeling framework can potentially be used to examine various future scenarios and to develop recommendations for a sustainable management scheme for the Alamo Lake. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

Changing fluvial styles in volcaniclastic successions: A cretaceous example from the Cerro Barcino Formation, Patagonia	JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES												The Cretaceous Puesto La Paloma (PLPM) and Cerro Castano (CCM) members (Cerro Barcino Formation, Chubut Group) are pyroclastic-rich, alluvial successions deposited in the Somuncura-Canadon Asfalto Basin during sag and endorheic conditions. The PLPM comprises sheet-like tuffaceous sandstone strata, whereas the overlying CCM includes sheet-to ribbon-channel sandstone bodies intercalated within tuffaceous and fine-grained sediments. In this context, the goals of this contribution were: i) to make a detailed documentation of the contrasting sedimentary palaeonvironments; and ii) to infer the allocyclic controls that governed the sedimentation of both units. The study area is located in the western sector of the basin, where six localities, which were studied. Six facies associations were defined including ash-falls, sheet-floods, shallow lakes, aeolian, fluvial channel-belts, and reworked debris-flows. We defined four stratigraphic intervals for the studied sections, denominated 1 to 4 in chronological order of deposition, which increase their thicknesses toward the Puesto Mesa-Cerro Leon site. The interval 1 (18-42 m thick) corresponds to the PLPM and includes numerous pedogenized sheet-flood deposits, carbonate-rich lacustrine, aeolian sandy facies, and ash-fall beds. The interval 1 is interpreted as an ephemeral and unconfined alluvial system that interacted with aeolian dunes and dry interdune zones. The interval 2 (20-47 m thick) represents the lower part of the CCM. It shows an alternation of fluvial channel-belt deposits and vegetated floodplain facies with sediments originated from sheet-floods, lakes, and few ash-falls and debris-flows. The mean palaeoflow was toward E-SE, except in the northernmost locality where the drainage was towards SW. Proportion of channel-belt bodies ranges from 10 to 36%, reaching higher values in the northern part of the study area, where they are also thicker. The interval 2 represents a permanent, meandering or locally low-sinuosity, fluvial system, and displays both an increase of lacustrine facies and a decrease of ash-fall deposits. The interval 3 (7.5-27 m thick) corresponds to the middle part of the CCM, and lacks channel-belt bodies. It has the highest participation of sheet-flood and ash-fall deposits. This interval entirely records a pedogenized floodplain setting. In relation to the interval 2, participation of debris-flow deposits remains constant and lacustrine facies subtly increases. The interval 4 (18-148 m thick) represents the upper part of the CCM. It comprises an alternation of channel-belt bodies and pedogenized floodplain facies, the last characterized by sheet-flood, lake, debris-flow, and volcanic ash rain deposits. The mean palaeoflow was toward E-SE, except in the two localities positioned further north where the drainage was towards NE and SSE. Proportion of channel-belt deposits ranges from 6 to 32%. It represents channelized and perennial fluvial systems with meandering and locally low-sinuosity styles. Increase in channel proportion and thicker channel bodies are in the northern part of the study area. Particularly, in Puesto Mesa-Cerro Leon locality this interval is the thickest and has the highest proportion of thicker channel belt bodies. We interpret these changes in fades architecture as the response to alternated periods of high (intervals 1 and 3) and low (intervals 2 and 4) primary pyroclastic sediment supply. Moreover, there was a climatic change to wetter conditions (intervals 1 to 2-4); as well as intrabasinal tectonic activity in northern area for intervals 2 and 4 inferred from palaeocurrent data.

Explaining recreational angling catch rates of Eurasian perch, Perca fluviatilis: the role of natural and fishing-related environmental factors	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												Angling catch records are frequently used to reveal fish population developments. It is therefore important to understand the determinants of angling catches. This study focused on angler-related, biotic and abiotic factors influencing catchability of Eurasian perch, Perca fluviatilis L. A multi-lake (21 lakes) study based on angling diaries collected in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany (2006/2007), found that angler-related factors such as fishing experience, species preference and bait/lure type had a large impact on perch catch rates. Additionally, environmental conditions (nutritional status and water transparency) affected either the size or the number of perch caught by anglers. Catch rates varied seasonally, which was confirmed by an experimental fishery on a gravel pit (2008). This portion of the study showed that altered food availabilities in the course of the year caused food limitation in perch, which in turn facilitated high catch rates and female-biased exploitation in autumn. It is concluded that both angler-related and abiotic factors interact affecting perch catch rates and size of perch captured in recreational angling.

J	Liu, G; Gong, ZZ; Li, QY				Liu, Gang; Gong, Zhizhong; Li, Qingyue			Variations in gut bacterial communities between lesser white-fronted geese wintering at Caizi and Shengjin lakes in China	MICROBIOLOGYOPEN												The avian gut microbiota plays an important role in shaping the health of its host. However, knowledge of gut bacteria in birds lags behind that of other animals. In this study, we investigated the gut bacterial communities of lesser white-fronted geese (Anser erythropus) wintering at Shengjin Lake and Caizi Lake, China, using high-throughput sequencing (Illumina MiSeq). Altogether, 1,053,624 high-quality sequences and 4,405 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were acquired from 30 fecal samples (15 per lake). The OTUs represented eight phyla and 17 classes from the Caizi Lake samples and seven phyla and 16 classes from the Shengjin Lake samples. Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were the dominant phyla. The spatial distance and the Chao1, Simpson, and Shannon indices showed that the alpha diversity differed significantly between the samples from both lakes. The phylogenetic tree and heatmap analyses showed that all the Caizi Lake samples were clustered together and all the Shengjin Lake samples were clustered together. These findings suggest that diet may be an important driver of gut microbial community structure in the birds from each lake, and the obvious differentiation in their gut microbial structures may indicate that the bacteria are highly sensitive to food sources at both lakes.

PTE concentrations, measured in mg/kg, show significant variability: Hg (0.03) < Cd (0.26) < As (10.98) < Pb (13.88) < Cu (48.61) < Ni (62.45) < Zn (70.97) < Cr (96.28) < Mn (1015) < Fe (38357). Seasonal variations were observed, in particular increased concentrations of As, Cd and Pb in summer (p < 0.05). Contamination and ecological risk indices (mHQ, EF, I-geo, CF, PLI, E-r(i), mCd, NPI, PERI, MPI, and TRI) indicate moderate to low levels of contamination, suggesting potential ecological effects.

Life History Diversity of Snake River Finespotted Cutthroat Trout: Managing for Persistence in a Rapidly Changing Environment	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Over the last century, native trout have experienced dramatic population declines, particularly in larger river systems where habitats associated with different spawning life history forms have been lost through habitat degradation and fragmentation. The resulting decrease in life history diversity has affected the capacity of populations to respond to environmental variability and disturbance. Unfortunately, because few large rivers are intact enough to permit full expression of life history diversity, it is unclear what patterns of diversity should be a conservation target. In this study, radiotelemetry was used to identify spawning and migration patterns of Snake River Finespotted Cutthroat Trout Oncorhynchus clarkii behnkei in the upper Snake River. Individuals were implanted with radio tags in October 2007 and 2008, and monitored through October 2009. Radio-tagged cutthroat trout in the upper Snake River exhibited variation in spawning habitat type and location, migration distance, spawn timing, postspawning behavior, and susceptibility to mortality sources. Between May and July, Cutthroat Trout spawned in runoff-dominated tributaries, groundwater-dominated spring creeks, and side channels of the Snake River. Individuals migrated up to 101 km from tagging locations in the upper Snake River to access spawning habitats, indicating that the upper Snake River provided seasonal habitat for spawners originating throughout the watershed. Postspawning behavior also varied; by August each year, 28% of spring-creek spawners remained in their spawning location, compared with 0% of side-channel spawners and 7% of tributary spawners. These spawning and migration patterns reflect the connectivity, habitat diversity, and dynamic template of the Snake River. Ultimately, promoting life history diversity through restoration of complex habitats may provide the most opportunities for cutthroat trout persistence in an environment likely to experience increased variability from climate change and disturbance from invasive species.

J	Hawkins, BA				Hawkins, BA			Summer vegetation, deglaciation and the anomalous bird diversity gradient in eastern North America	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim Geographic variation in the species richness of birds has been shown to be strongly associated with annual water and energy levels (actual evapotranspiration, AET) at the global scale. However, the gradient in eastern North America appears to be anomalous, because richness is greatest around the Great Lakes, whereas AET is highest in the south-eastern US. Here I examine if birds may be responding to vegetation produced during the breeding season rather than to annual production. Location North America east of longitude 98degrees W. Methods The bird richness pattern was examined using climatic variables, remotely sensed estimates of annual and seasonal plant biomass, and time since areas were exposed by the retreating Laurentide ice sheet from 20,000 to 6000 yr BP. Results Average summer GVI (Global Vegetation Index, derived from NDVI) was found to be positively linearly associated with richness, explaining 82% of the variance, whereas the relationships between richness and annual measures of both AET and GVI were curvilinear. The pattern of retreat of the Laurentide ice sheet explained an additional 6% of the variance in richness, consistent with a previous analysis of Canadian birds. Main conclusions In eastern North America, a seasonal variable associated with plant production explains the diversity gradient rather than the annual measures, but it does not undermine a general conclusion that bird diversity is closely linked with plant biomass. Further, both contemporary and historical factors appear to influence the gradient, and an association between bird richness and the geographic pattern of glacial retreat is detectable in both climatic and plant-biomass models of bird diversity.

Modeling of Extreme Hydrological Events in the Baksan River Basin, the Central Caucasus, Russia	HYDROLOGY												High mountain areas are prone to extreme hydrological events, and their study is especially important in the context of ongoing intensive deglaciation. In this research, a model "chain" consisting of a hydrodynamic model and a runoff formation model is adopted to simulate a glacier lake outburst flood (GLOF) from Bashkara Lake (the Central Caucasus, Russia) and its effect on downstream. In addition to an actual GLOF event that occurred on 1 September 2017 and led to casualties and significant destruction in the Adylsu and Baksan Rivers valleys, possible scenarios for the re-outburst of the lake are considered. The hydrographs of the outburst and the downstream movement of the flood wave along the Adylsu River valley are estimated using STREAM 2D two-dimensional hydrodynamic model. The water discharges in the entire river network of the Baksan River are assessed using the ECOMAG (ECOlogical Model for Applied Geophysics) runoff formation model. The output flood hydrograph from the hydrodynamic model is set as additional input into the Baksan River runoff formation model in the upper reaches of the Adylsu River. As a result of the simulations, estimates for the contribution of GLOFs and precipitation to an increase in peak discharge along the Baksan River were obtained. The actual outburst flood contributed 45% and precipitation 30% to the peak flow in the Baksan River at the mouth of the Adylsu River (10 km from the outburst site). In Tyrnyauz (40 km from the outburst site), the contributions of the outburst flood and precipitation were equal and, in Zayukovo (70 km from the outburst site), the outburst flood contributed only 20% to the peak flow, whereas precipitation contributed 44%. Similar calculations were made for future potential re-outburst flood, taking into account climatic changes with an increase in air temperatures of 2 degrees C, an increase in precipitation of 10% in winter and a decrease of 10% in summer. The maximum discharge of the re-outburst flood in the Adylsu River mouth, according to model estimations, will be approximately three times less than the discharge of the actual outburst on 1 September 2017 and can contribute up to 18% of the peak discharge in the Baksan River at the confluence.

J	POLLOCK, SJ				POLLOCK, SJ			REMEDIATING HIGHWAY DEICING SALT CONTAMINATION OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE WATER-SUPPLIES IN MASSACHUSETTS	RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING												During the winters Of 1974 1975 through 1989/1990, the Massachusetts Department of Public Works (MDPW) applied an annual average of about 196,000 tonnes of sodium chloride on state highways for snow and ice control purposes. During the period 1983-1990, MDPW received complaints of salt contamination of public and private water supplies frofm about 100 of the 351 municipalities in Massachusetts. During this period, 103 private well complaints were resolved by a variety of remedial actions. These include: well replacement, public supply connection, water treatment and highway drainage modification. The average remedia cost per complaint was about 12,000. Two additional remedial actions used by MDPW to alleviate salt contamination of private water supplies are: (a) reduced salting on state highways; (b) use of salt substitute, calcium magnesium acetate. Examples of the effectiveness of each of these remedial actions are: (a) reduced salting on Route 9, in Goshen, Massachusetts, during the period December 1983 to December 1988, reduced the sodium levels in nearby domestic wells from 79 mg/l (milligrams per liter) to 36 mg/l; (b) use of calcium magnesium acetate as a salt substitute on County Road, Freetown and Lakeville, Massachusetts, beginning with the winter of 1987/1988, reduced the sodium levels ion nearby domestic wells from 75 mg/l in 1986 to 34 mg/l in 1990. Reduced salting is also used to aleviate highway deicing salt contamination of public water supplies. During the winter of 1990/1991, there were 14 specifically defined reduced salt areas on state highways for this purpose.																			0921-3449					OCT	1992	7	1-3					7	24		10.1016/0921-3449(92)90003-K	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0921-3449(92)90003-K													WOS:A1992JW53100002
J	Huang, WZ; Qiao, YT; Jian, MQ				Huang, Weizhi; Qiao, Yunting; Jian, Maoqiu			Surface temperature-related variations in the East Asian summer monsoon during three warming stages	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												The global mean surface temperature has experienced different warming stages, but there is less work on discussion of the regional climate changes under the background of different global warming rates. This study investigated the surface temperature (ST)-related trends in the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) and underlying mechanisms during three warming stages, with a view to develop a new understanding of the responses of the EASM to global warming. Based on the statistical method of piecewise linear regression (PLR) to ST anomaly time series, the ST variation process from 1958 to 2014 has been divided into three stages with different linear trends: 1958-1975 (hiatus), 1976-1997 (acceleration) and 1998-2014 (slowdown). During the first stage, accompanied by two anomalous lower-level cyclones, a weakening trend of the southerly winds over eastern China is observed. The enhanced cyclone over the Yellow Sea, with local ST cooling, is associated with the CGT-like (circumglobal teleconnection) pattern, while the other one over the Philippines can be attributed to the local sea surface temperature (SST) warming. The ST-related anomalous EASM circulation exhibits an enhanced lower-level anticyclone over the northern Philippine Sea during the second stage. The warming around Lake Baikal and the phase change of the East Atlantic/Western Russia (EAWR) pattern can weaken upper-level East Asian jet stream (EAJS) and then provide a favourable condition for the descent related to the lower-level anticyclonic anomaly. As for the third stage, the anomalous ST and related EASM circulation both display a dipole pattern. Through influencing the meridional thermal contrast and distribution of convergence over East Asia (EA), the interaction between anomalous ST and EASM circulation may be the major mechanism that results in the increased (decreased) ST and enhanced barotropic anticyclone (cyclone) over southern (northern) EA.

J	Varekamp, JC; Kreulen, R				Varekamp, JC; Kreulen, R			The stable isotope geochemistry of volcanic lakes, with examples from Indonesia	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												Stable isotope compositions (delta D, delta(18)O and delta(34)S) Of volcanic lake waters, gas condensates and spring waters from Indonesia, Italy, Japan, and Russia were measured. The spring fluids and gas samples plot in a broad array between meteoric waters and local high-temperature volcanic gas compositions. The delta D and delta(18)O data from volcanic lakes in East Indonesia plot in a concave band ranging from local meteoric waters to evaporated fluids to waters heavier than local high-temperature Volcanic gases. We investigated isotopic fractionation processes in volcanic lakes at elevated temperatures with simultaneous mixing of meteoric waters and volcanic gases. An elevated lake water temperature gives enhanced kinetic isotope fractionation and changes in equilibrium fractionation factors, providing relatively flat isotope evolution curves in delta(18)O-delta D diagrams. A numerical simulation model is used to derive the timescales of isotopic evolution of crater lakes as a function of atmospheric parameters, lake water temperature and fluxes of meteoric water, volcanic gas input, evaporation, and seepage losses. The same model is used to derive the flux magnitude of the Keli Mutu lakes in Indonesia. The calculated volcanic gas fluxes are of the same order as those derived from energy budget models or direct gas flux measurements in open craters (several 100 m(3) volcanic water/day) and indicate a water residence time of 1-2 decades. The delta(34)S data from the Keli Mutu lakes show a much wider range than those from gases and springs, which is probably related to the precipitation of sulfur in these acid brine lakes. The isotopic mass balance and S/Cl values suggest that about half of the sulfur input in the hottest Keli Mutu lake is converted into native sulfur. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Eutrophication and cyanobacteria blooms in run-of-river impoundments in North Carolina, USA	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT					25th International Symposium of the North-American-Lake-Management-Society	NOV, 2005	Madison, WI	N Amer Lake Management Soc				We compared monthly data taken during the dry summer growing season of 2002 in 11 potable water supply reservoirs (19-85 years old based on year filled) within the North Carolina Piedmont, including measures of watershed land use, watershed area, reservoir morphometry (depth, surface area, volume), suspended solids (SS), nutrient concentrations (total nitrogen, TN; total Kjeldahl nitrogen, TKN; nitrate + nitrite, NO(3)(-) + NO(2)(-); total phosphorus, TP; total organic carbon), phytoplankton chlorophyll a (chla) concentrations, cyanobacteria assemblages, and microcystin concentrations from monthly data taken during the dry summer 2002 growing season. The reservoirs were considered collectively or as two subgroups by age as "mod." (moderate age, 19-40 years post-fill, n = 5) and "old" (74-85 yr post-fill, n = 6). The run-of-river impoundments were meso-/eutrophic and turbid (means 25-125 mu g TP/L, 410-1,800 mu g TN/L, 3-70 mu g chla/L and 5.7-41.9 mg SS/L). Under drought conditions in these turbid systems, there was a positive relationship between chla and both TN and TP, supported by correlation analyses and hierarchical ANOVA models. The models also indicated significant positive relationships between TN and TP, and between SS and both TP and TN. Agricultural land use was positively correlated with TKN for the reservoirs considered collectively, and with TN, TKN, TP, and chla in mod. reservoirs. In models considering the reservoirs by age group, TN:TP ratios were significantly lower and NO(3)(-) + NO(2)(-) was significantly higher in old reservoirs, and these relationships were stronger when reservoir age was used as a linear predictor. Cyanobacteria assemblages in the two reservoir age groups generally were comparable in abundance and species composition, and comprised 60-95% (up to 1.9 x 10(6) cells/mL) of the total phytoplankton cell number. Potentially toxic taxa were dominated by Cylindrospennopsis raciborskii and C philippinensis. Although known microcystin producers were low in abundance, microcystin (< 0.8 mu g/L) was detected in most samples. TP and chla were significant predictors of total cyanobacterial abundance. The data suggest that at present these turbid, meso-/eutrophic reservoirs have moderate cyanobacteria abundance and low cyanotoxin (microcystin) levels over the summer growing season, even in low-precipitation seasons that favor cyanobacteria. Accelerated eutrophication from further watershed development is expected to promote increased cyanobacterial abundance and adversely affect the value of these reservoirs as potable water supplies.

J	Chen, J; Dai, FC; Yao, X				Chen, Jian; Dai, Fuchu; Yao, Xin			Holocene debris-flow deposits and their implications on the climate in the upper Jinsha River valley, China	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Major debris-flow deposits occur along the xerothermic valley of the upper Jinsha River. The debris-flow deposits, ranging in thickness from 1 to 20 m, invariably occupy gently inclined piedmont slopes. The sediments are presently deeply dissected by gullies, and the process of mass movement has almost ceased. Detailed textural, stratigraphical, and geochemical studies reveal the formation processes of the debris flows. Seven debris-flow incidents are noted based on the unit combination characteristics of debris-flow deposits. The age estimates of optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) show that the occurrence of debris flows started at around 10.6 kyr BP and weakened until 4.5 kyr BP, corresponding to the obvious strengthened phase of the summer monsoons in the region. The ages of the debris-flow deposits indicate that the occurrence of a mass of debris flows was a response to the intensified summer monsoon in the SE fringe of the Tibetan Plateau since the early Holocene.

It has a surface area of 4.6 km(2), a maximum depth of originally 60 m and is monomictic with a stratification period from early spring to end of October. The lake is oligotrophic with low nutrient concentrations (e.g. SRP in spring about 8 mu g L (-aEuro parts per thousand 1)) and minor oxygen depletion in the hypolimnion during thermal stagnation. The lake is highly turbid due to severe particle import by several rivers during rain periods. This led to a massive deposition of sediments, lifting the maximum depth to 45 m in 2008. Furthermore, the photic zone reached hardly more than 10 m. Algal species diversity is high; however, diatoms from the genus Cyclotella dominate most of the year both in numbers and biomass. Our study describes for the first time the hydrography and limnology of the Bovilla Reservoir.

The altered outcrops of the post-collapse tuff of Sulphur Creek (480 ka) extend from the canyon rim to more than 300 m beneath it. The hydrothermal minerals are zoned, with an advanced argillic alteration consisting of an association of quartz (opal) + kaolinite +/- alunite +/- dickite, and an argillic or potassic alteration association with quartz + illite +/- adularia. Disseminated fine-grained pyrite or marcasite is ubiquitous in both alteration types. These alteration associations are characteristic products of shallow volcanic epithermal environments. The contact between the two alteration types is about 100 m beneath the rim. By analogy to other active geothermal systems including active hydrothermal springs in the Yellowstone Caldera, the transition from kaolinite to illite occurred at temperatures in the range 150 to 170 degrees C. An 40Ar/39Ar age on alunite of 154,000 +/- 16,000 years suggests that hydrothermal activity has been ongoing since at least that time. A northwest-trending linear array of extinct and active hot spring centers in the Sevenmile Hole area implies a deeper structural control for the upflowing hydrothermal fluids. We interpret this deeper structure to be the Yellowstone Caldera ring fault that is covered by the younger tuff of Sulphur Creek. The Sevenmile Hole altered area lies at the eastern end of a band of hydrothermal centers that may mark the buried extension of the Yellowstone Caldera ring fault across the northern part of the Caldera.

Two leading modes for the temperature variability over NEA are obtained by EOF analysis. The first EOF mode is characterized by a homogeneous temperature anomaly over NEA and therefore is called the NEA mode. This anomaly extends from southeast of Lake Baikal to Japan, with a central area in Northeast China. The second EOF mode is characterized by a seesaw pattern, showing a contrasting distribution between East Asia (specifically including the Changbai Mountains in Northeast China, Korea, and Japan) and north of this region. This mode is named the East Asia (EA) mode. Both modes contribute equivalently to the temperature variability in EA. The two leading modes are associated with different circulation anomalies. A warm NEA mode is associated with a positive geopotential height anomaly over NEA and thus a weakened upper-tropospheric westerly jet. On the other hand, a warm EA mode is related to a positive height anomaly over EA and a northward displaced jet. In addition, the NEA mode tends to be related to the Eurasian teleconnection pattern, while the EA mode is associated with the East Asia-Pacific/Pacific-Japan pattern.																			0256-1530	1861-9533				JAN	2016	33	1					1	9		10.1007/s00376-015-5056-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00376-015-5056-0													WOS:000365703700001

We measured delta H-2 and delta O-18 values and estimated water mass balances over 2 hydrologically differing years in a chain of 10 boreal lakes. During a warm and dry summer, evaporative loss enriched the isotope values at lake surfaces. Thus, in lakes that were thermally stratified during summer, the isotope values differed distinctively between epilimnion and hypolimnion. During the following rainy summer, the within-lake variation of isotope values was much lower with no clear trend, presumably a result of a more unstable water column and faster water throughflow in the lake chain. After autumnal mixing the lake delta O-18 values were strongly correlated with lake area and proportion of inland waters of the catchment area. The interannual within-lake difference was then similar to 1 parts per thousand, indicating differences in evaporation. Isotope mass balance (IMB) calculations and those based on lake temperature and hydrological measurements in the nearby region yielded similar results for the rainy ice-free period. Presumably, prerequisites of steady-state conditions for IMB were better met in the rainy year than during the previous drier year. For some lakes the results suggested remarkable volumes of groundwater inflow, whose role in boreal lake water budgets deserves more attention in future studies.

However, how functional feeding traits, including bill size and leg length, determine the niche of mixed flocks of shorebird species has seldomly been studied, as well as, microhabitat variables affect the spatial patterns of availability and the quality of patches for wintering. From October 2016 to March 2017 at Shengjin Lake, Anhui Province, China, we recorded 226 scan samples from the different microhabitats and 93 focal animal videos of four common shorebird species: common greenshank, spotted redshank, Kentish plover, and little ringed plover. We found that the species participating in the mixed groups were different in each microhabitat. The results of the overlap index for microhabitats and foraging techniques between the species were consistent with the morphological characteristics of these species. Kentish and little ringed plovers had the highest Pianka's niche overlap index values of 0.95 and 0.98 for microhabitats and foraging techniques, respectively, whereas common greenshank and spotted redshank had values of 0.78 and 0.89, respectively. Common greenshank and spotted redshank used four foraging techniques: a single probe (PR), multiple probes (MPR), a single peck (PE), and multiple pecks (MPE). Kentish and little ringed plovers only used PE and MPE. The mean bill size, mean leg length, and mean foraging frequency were significantly associated with water depth. The mean bill size and mean leg length were both significantly correlated with the mean foraging frequency of shorebirds. The vegetated area was the most important variable for grouping among shorebirds. We concluded that the four species showed differences in their preferred microhabitats and foraging patterns. Interspecific morphological differences, including bill and leg lengths, resulted in niche differentiation. Thus, effective resource allocation by regional species was realized, and a dynamic balance was achieved by the mixed foraging species. The information on foraging behavior and habitat requirements could be useful in the management of water levels in natural areas and conservation of a diversity of wintering shorebirds.					; Yu, Chao/NWH-3079-2025; ZHANG, Ruilin/IYJ-3161-2023; Zhou, Lizhi/AAF-4535-2021	zhouZhou, li zhiLizhi/0000-0002-5702-4658; Cheng, Lei/0009-0004-2755-0413													2045-7758					MAY	2023	13	5							e10054	10.1002/ece3.10054	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.10054								37181212					WOS:000984437700001

This warm, monomictic lake gains and loses 5,945 cal cm-2 annually. Dissolved color and algal turbidity limit light and heat penetration, causing steep gradients in temperature, oxygen, dissolved inorganic C, and remobilized sedimentary P during stratification from March through November. Water below 5 m is cool (< 14-degrees-C) and anoxic throughout the year. Weak chemical gradients can persist in the water column during homothermy. The lake is ineffectively mixed because of morphometry, wind sheltering by trees, and the brevity of homothermy. An unusual consequence of winter mixing is very low oxygen concentrations in surface waters (< 1 mg liter-1). Surface-water oxygen is diluted by upward mixing of deeper anoxic waters, and O2 is consumed by BOD and reduced Fe and S. Deoxygenation at mixis occurs in several African lakes, but is unreported in warm, monomictic lakes of North America.

Spatiotemporal relationships of threatened cetaceans and anthropogenic threats in the lower Yangtze system	FRONTIERS IN CONSERVATION SCIENCE												The impacts of fisheries interactions on cetaceans can be challenging to determine, often requiring multiple complementary investigative approaches. The Yangtze finless porpoise (Neophocaena asiaeorientalis asiaeorientalis), one of the few Critically Endangered cetaceans, is endemic to the middle-lower Yangtze drainage, a system impacted by multiple anthropogenic pressures. Bycatch mortality is implicated in regional porpoise decline, but the significance and dynamics of porpoise interactions with fishing activities and other threats remain poorly understood. We conducted boat-based surveys to map seasonal distributions and spatial congruence of porpoises and two potential threats (fishing and sand-mining), and an interview survey of fishing communities to understand temporal patterns and drivers of regional fishing activity, across Poyang Lake and the adjoining Yangtze mainstem. Variation in harmful and non-harmful gear use (non-fixed nets versus static pots and traps) between these landscapes might be an important factor affecting local porpoise status. Within Poyang Lake, spatial correlations between porpoises and threats were relatively weak, seasonal porpoise and threat hotspots were located in different regions, and two protected areas had higher porpoise encounter rates and densities than some unprotected sections. However, porpoise hotspots were mostly in unprotected areas, threats were widely observed across reserves, and more fishing and sand-mining was seasonally observed within reserves than within unprotected areas. Compared to null distributions, porpoises were detected significantly closer to fishing activities in summer and further from sand-mining in winter, indicating possible spatial risks of gear entanglement and disturbance. Reported porpoise bycatch deaths are associated with fixed and non-fixed nets, hook-based gears, and electrofishing. Longitudinal patterns in reported gear use indicate that hook-based fishing has decreased substantially and is generally conducted by older fishers, and significantly fewer respondents now practice fishing as their sole source of income, but electrofishing has increased. This combined research approach indicates a continued potential risk to porpoises from changing fisheries interactions and other threats, highlighting the importance of fishing restrictions and appropriate support for fishing communities impacted by this legislation. A potential "win-win" for both biodiversity and local livelihoods could be achieved through wider use of static pots and traps, which are not associated with bycatch deaths.					; Mei, Zhigang/AAQ-1545-2020	Mei, Zhigang/0000-0002-1826-9177; 														2673-611X				NOV 2	2022	3								929959	10.3389/fcosc.2022.929959	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fcosc.2022.929959													WOS:001004324000001

This analysis of fossil diatoms in the sediments of Kootenay Lake provided evidence for environmental change as a result of man''s activities in the drainage basin. Changes to the trophic status of the lake are related to operation of a phosphate fertilizer plant (beginning in 1953) on the major southern inlet river and to more recent water regulation on both the southern and northern major inlet rivers. Diatom numbers and volumes at the deeper core depths were lowest. Diatom species in the deeper core depths consisted of an assemblage of oligotrophic and eutrophic indicators corresponding to high (but not critically high)P loading to the lake. Above the 5-cm depth, numbers increased and peaked at the 3-cm depth in samples nearest the south end of the lake. At other locations within the lake, where sedimentation rates were lower, numbers peaked in the top centimeter of sediment. Concomitant with increased P loading diatom species indicative of oligotrophic conditions such as Cyclotella ocellata declined, while eutrophic indicators including Cyclotella glomerata, Melosira granulata var. angustissima, Stephanodiscus spp., Asterionella formosa and Fragilaria crotonensis increased. Asterionella formosa and Fragilaria crotonensis showed highest abundances in the top 2 cm of the core. These species, which form a major component of the spring and fall diatom blooms, were responding to both increased nutrients and improved light conditions resulting from decreased freshet turbidity. The Araphidineae/Centrales ratio was not useful in classifying trophic changes in Kootenay Lake since numbers of centric diatoms did not decline with nutrient enrichements (although there was a dominance shift from oligotrophic centrics to eutrophic centrics). Shannon-Wiener diversity values remained high throughout the recent history of the lake.																			0008-4026						1983	61	7					1983	1992		10.1139/b83-214	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b83-214													WOS:A1983QZ17700022

The primary objective was to investigate the spatial variability of chlorophyll a (chl a) on a whole-lake scale and to identify the key factors affecting phytoplankton growth. Stepwise multiple linear regression and Spearman's rank correlation analyses showed that the shade index is the major factor determining the spatial distribution of chl a; nutrients don't explain much variation in chl a, except in the east. The relationships between shade index and chl a varied regionally. Chl a varied inversely with the variation of the shade index, especially in the north and south, reflecting light limitation. However, the correlation was positive in the east due to high chl a concentration negatively affecting light availability, which was promoted by sufficient nutrients. In the center, no factor was found to have an obvious effect on phytoplankton growth, most likely because of human activities and high heterogeneity. These new data on the spatial variability of chl a and its relationship with light availability in Lake Poyang will be crucial to understand chl a regulation and contribute to the knowledge regarding phytoplankton in the Yangtze Basin.

Distribution and dynamics of Greenland subglacial lakes	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Few subglacial lakes have been identified beneath the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) despite extensive documentation in Antarctica, where periodic release of water can impact ice flow. Here we present an ice-sheet-wide survey of Greenland subglacial lakes, identifying 54 candidates from airborne radio-echo sounding, and 2 lakes from ice-surface elevation changes. These range from 0.2-5.9 km in length, and are mostly distributed away from ice divides, beneath relatively slow-moving ice. Based on our results and previous observations, we suggest three zones of formation: stable lakes in northern and eastern regions above the Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA) but away from the interior; hydrologically-active lakes near the ELA recharged by surface meltwater and; small, seasonally-active lakes below the ELA, which form over winter and drain during the melt season. These observations provide important constraints on the GrIS's basal thermal regime and help refine our understanding of the subglacial hydrological system.

The study was conducted at Laguna Honda, a semi-permanent lake located in the semiarid Mediterranean environment of southern Spain. Over 1 year, the lake water level was monitored continuously and water samples from the northern and southern margin were taken monthly for major ion concentration and triple oxygen and hydrogen isotope analyses. Over the study period, the lake water level dropped from 1.4 to 0.6 m, while salinity increased from 23 to 130 g L-1 and the delta O-18, delta H-2, and O-17 excess of lake water varied from -2 parts per thousand to 15 parts per thousand, -26 parts per thousand to 51 parts per thousand, and -9 per meg to -87 per meg, respectively. Hydrological mass balance calculations indicate that precipitation, basin discharge, and evaporation control lake water level changes in Laguna Honda, and major inflow from other sources, such as groundwater, is absent. The lake water's isotope composition is mainly driven by changes in relative humidity (34 %-73 %), while precipitation and basin discharge can cause transitional mixing effects that, however, remain small in magnitude (<10 %). In the O-17 excess vs. delta ' 18O space, the lake water forms a loop evolving from low delta(18)Oand high O-17 excess in winter to higher delta(18)Oand lower O-17 excess in summer along a convex curvature, then back to low delta(18)Oand high O-17 excess with the beginning of the subsequent rainy season along a concave curvature. The triple oxygen isotope system allows the identification of non-steady-state conditions, which is challenging using delta(2)Hand delta(18)Oalone due to the linearity of trends in this isotope system. The large seasonal variability of triple oxygen isotopes should be considered when interpreting isotope data obtained from paleo-archives from lake sediments in semiarid and arid environments.

Long-Term and Interannual Dynamics of Walleye and Yellow Perch in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Walleye Sander vitreus and yellow perch Perca flavescens are well-studied, ecologically important fish species that co-occur in a wide range of systems and experience complex interactions; on the one hand, they are physiologically and ecologically similar and therefore may respond analogously to environmental variation, while on the other hand they interact antagonistically as competitors, predators, and prey. In Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron, walleyes and yellow perch have supported a combination of commercial and recreational fisheries and have been exposed to a series of ecosystem-level stressors and management actions that may have impacted these populations via multiple pathways. We used dynamic factor analysis and correlation analysis of walleye and yellow perch annual fall trawl catch data to elucidate the overall trends in walleye and yellow perch populations in Saginaw Bay. The results suggest that walleyes and yellow perch trend differently; while the relative abundance of age-0-2 walleyes generally increased and their mean length decreased from 1980 to 2008, the trends in yellow perch abundance and length differed among the young-of-year, yearling, and age-2 age-classes. Moreover, interannual negative associations between yellow perch relative abundance and mean size are suggestive of compensatory, density-dependent control on growth, while similar evidence is lacking for walleyes. Correlation analyses indicate that walleye year-class strength is set by the fall of age 0, while the age at which recruitment is set for yellow perch is less clear and may not occur until the fall of age 1. Thus, we suggest that future studies evaluating environmental determinants of year-class strength in Saginaw Bay evaluate age-0 walleyes and age-1 yellow perch. Finally, while age-0 yellow perch and age-0 walleyes appear to respond similarly to annual environmental conditions, the recent increase in walleye abundance and decrease in the mean size of age-0 yellow perch may have contributed to the reduced abundance of adult yellow perch via walleye predation and overwinter mortality.

J	Blomqvist, P				Blomqvist, P			Late summer phytoplankton responses to experimental manipulations of nutrients and grazing in unlimed and limed Lake Njupfatet, central Sweden	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Phytoplankton biomass and community composition were studied in Lake Njupfatet during two consecutive years, one before and one after whole-lake calcite treatment. As a result of the liming, total phosphorus decreased by 30%, and the average epilimnetic biomass of phytoplankton decreased by almost 40%. This decrease was mainly due to the complete loss of the dominant species, the cyanobacterium Merismopedia tenuissima which, prior to liming, constituted up to 80% of the late summer biomass. Enclosure experiments were performed to assess the role of nutrients and zooplankton in regulating late summer phytoplankton community in the unlimed and limed lake. The Merismopedia-dominated community of the acidic lake did not respond to nutrient additions and, with the exception of dinoflagellates, most of its constituents were not sensitive to grazing. The lack of response by Merismopedia was probably due to its inability to utilize nitrate as a nitrogen source. The lack of response by other species is attributed to allelopathic control of the system by Merismopedia Since Merismopedia was not grazed, this species may act as a dead-end in energy flow towards higher trophic levels. Furthermore, structural changes at higher trophic levels during early stages of acidification, e.g., the loss of daphnids, may be due to acidification-induced dominance of Merismopedia and other cyanophytes. The phytoplankton community of the alkaline lake showed a significant and positive response to nutrient additions. Community composition also changed from chrysophytes and green algae to cryptophytes and diatoms. Unless combined with nutrient additions, liming may have very little effect on the pelagic ecosystem at least during the first year after liming.																			0003-9136						1996	137	4					425	455																WOS:A1996VQ96600001

European palaeoclimatological records generally suggest a bipartite structure of the YD, potentially due to a northward retreat of the polar front around 12 100 cal a BP. However, several recent studies have shown more complex climate dynamics during the YD. Here we present new high-resolution palaeotemperature records for the YD (Loch Lomond Stadial; LLS) at Old Buckenham Mere. We show cooling of ca 3 degrees C at the onset of the LLS followed by an early LLS phase with relatively cool summer temperatures (ca 11.5 degrees C). The mid LLS experienced milder temperatures of ca 13 degrees C and was potentially characterised by wetter conditions. Summer temperatures initially decreased to values of ca 10 degrees C at the onset of the late LLS, before a gradual increase. Temperatures abruptly increase by ca 3 degrees C at the onset of the Holocene. This study is the first to show the occurrence of a tripartite LLS climate evolution in East England and fills an existing knowledge gap in our understanding of YD climate dynamics.																			0267-8179	1099-1417				JUL	2025	40	5					778	793		10.1002/jqs.3708	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jqs.3708		APR 2025											WOS:001461121000001

This is much younger than the well-known Hope Fault. Judging from its geological and geographical appearances the fault is close to vertical. Displaced river terraces at Kakapo Brook east of Lake Summer indicate a dextral rate of 6-6.8 mm/yr, while displaced streams west of Lake Summer indicate a rate of 8.1-12.1 mm/yr. This is an addition to the rate of movement across the Marlborough faults. If the rates for other Marlborough faults are accepted, the total dextral rate across them (including the Porters Pass Fault) would be about 38 mm/yr, which is about 81% of the relative plate movement. Thus there may be only one-fifth of the relative plate movement accommodated by other forms of deformation in the northern part of the South Island.																			0028-8306						1991	34	2					137	143		10.1080/00288306.1991.9514451	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288306.1991.9514451													WOS:A1991GE23900004

Upstream, surficial pore water presented lower values of Eh, which became negative in summer, whereas downstream Eh remained positive. Nutrient concentrations were especially high upstream, reaching 1000 mu mol L(-1) of NH4 and 75 mu mol L(-1) of PO4 during summer. In summer, measured fluxes showed intense respiration upstream, with an oxygen consumption of 130 mg m(-2) h(-1) and a respiratory quotient near 4, which indicates dominance of anaerobic respiration. Total CO2 efflux and nutrient fluxes were also high, reaching 30.50 mmol m(-2) h(-1) for CO2, >2000 mu mol m(-2) h(-1) for NH4 and 58 mu mol m(-2) h(-1) for PO4. A substantial amount of the total CO2 efflux (14 mmol m(-2) h(-1)) was due to calcium carbonate redissolution. Downstream, oxygen consumption, respiratory quotient and ammonium fluxes were lower (around 70 mg m(-2) h(-1), between 2 and 3, and <20 mu mol m(-2) h(-1), respectively), which indicates a moderate rate of decomposition activity and suggests denitrification as the main respiratory process. Differences between fluxes measured 'in situ' and those calculated from pore-water concentrations indicated non-diffusive fluxes upstream and suggest substantial denitrifying activity downstream.

Small scale distribution patterns of female and male Daubenton's bats (Myotis daubentonii)	ACTA CHIROPTEROLOGICA												We analysed the distribution and relative abundance of Myotis daubentonii in the lowlands and uplands around the Lahn river near the city of Giessen (Hessen, Central Germany). We assumed a positive correlation between distribution and relative abundance of the trawling M. daubentonii with the amount of water surface in our study area. We further expected an unequal distribution of male and female M. daubentonii especially during the energy demanding pregnancy and lactation period of females. Daubenton's bats were found at 75% of the 64 ponds and lakes we surveyed by standardized nightly spotlight counts. The number of Daubenton's bats correlated positively with the area of the water surface and negatively with the distance to the nursery colonies. Nursery colonies were located with radio-tracking and existed predominantly in the lowlands close to the Lahn river. Mean flight distance between nursery colonies and foraging areas was 2.3 km (mean +/- 1.4 km, range: 0.6-6.3 km). Sex ratio was determined at three sites studied in detail from 1992-2003 by mist-netting along regular used flight paths (n = 1,847 caught individuals). The number of female per male M. daubentonii was unequal and differed significantly between the three sites. In the lowland we found one site clearly dominated by females (median = 4.3 females per male, percentages of females 79.3%, n 169 individuals) and a second site with an almost balanced sex ratio (median = 1.1 females per male, percentages of females 50.3%, n = 939 individuals). At the third site in the uplands males outnumbered females (median = 0.2 females per male, percentages of females 13.5%, n = 739 individuals). The percentages of females remained largely constant from spring to mid summer and changed at the beginning of September. The study revealed that a detailed knowledge of the spatial distribution of gender specific roost sites and key foraging habitats is necessary for the establishment of meaningful monitoring and conservation measures for bats.

RAPID CHANGE IN HIGH-ELEVATION PRECIPITATION PATTERNS OF WESTERN NORTH AMERICA DURING THE MIDDLE EOCENE CLIMATIC OPTIMUM (MECO)	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE												We present Eocene terrestrial oxygen (delta O-18), carbon (delta C-13), and strontium (Sr-87/Sr-86) isotope lake and paleosol records from two high elevation sites on the western North American plateau. These records represent terrestrial stable isotope evidence of the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum (MECO) an enigmatic and rapid global warming event that interrupted protracted Eocene global cooling at around 40.0 Ma. Revised stratigraphy based on 15 40Ar/39Ar ages from air-fall and water-lain ash in the Elko basin (Nevada) places evaporative lake conditions followed by rapid (<150 ka) freshening and a large (14-15 %) negative shift in delta O-18 of lake water between 40.2 Ma and 39.4 Ma, right at the climax of MECO. Prior to MECO high delta O-18 and delta C-13 values in well-laminated organic-rich shales are consistent with high evaporation-to-precipitation ratios, lack of lake overturn, persistent lake stratification, and moderate to high lake salinity. However, a step-wise large magnitude (>20%) decrease in delta C-13 values already during the pre-MECO cooling phase, requires that in contrast to pre-MECO climate conditions, MECO temperature seasonality in western North America was sufficiently strong to (re-)establish regular lake overturn. The rate and magnitude of the rapid negative lacustrine delta O-18 shift during MECO in the Elko lake basin is inconsistent with a simple scenario of regional surface uplift affecting decrease of delta O-18 in precipitation and associated lake freshening. We consider the overall negative shift in delta O-18 of non-evaporatively O-18-enriched lake waters (-9.3 +/- 1.8 %) between the 42 to 43 Ma Elko Formation and the ca. 38 Ma base of the Indian Well Formation to be composed of a ca. 3 to 4 permil decrease in delta O-18 of lake carbonate as a consequence of post-MECO cooling and an additional ca. 5 to 6 permil decrease in delta O-18 of riverine lake input as a response to 43 to 38 Ma surface uplift. When combined with isotope-enabled global circulation model results, the Elko lake data further suggest that once critical elevations were attained a change in upstream moisture transport including strengthening of monsoonal summer rainfall on the (south-) eastern flanks of the Cordillera and a larger fraction of air parcel trajectories to the (eastern) lee of the Cordilleran highlands that had passed over the (western) continental interior were responsible for the rapid middle Eocene decrease in delta O-18 of precipitation in the central Cordilleran hinterland.					; Mulch, Andreas/A-1324-2013	Methner, Katharina/0000-0002-3753-8256; Hren, Michael/0000-0002-2866-8892; 													0002-9599	1945-452X				APR	2015	315	4					317	336		10.2475/04.2015.02	http://dx.doi.org/10.2475/04.2015.02													WOS:000368047300002

This study presents the results of high-resolution analyses of TOC/TN (C/N) ratio, delta C-13 and delta N-15 of sedimentary organic matter extracted from a sediment core from Dali Lake, Inner Mongolia, in order to monitor Holocene hydrological and ecological variations in the EASM margin. Concurrent increases in the values of these proxies are generally interpreted to reflect intensified surface runoff and vegetation development in the lake catchment, elevated lake levels and enhanced lake productivity; however, changes in delta C-13 and delta N-15 may also result from within-lake processes due to changes in lake level. These data indicate that Dali Lake experienced gradual rises in water level and primary productivity from 11,500 to 9800 cal yr BP, as documented by increases in TOC and TN concentrations, C/N ratios and delta C-13 and delta N-15 values. From 9800 to 7700 cal yr BP, high, stable TOC and TN concentrations and C/N ratios together with low delta C-13 and delta N-15 values suggest a status of high stands and high productivity for the lake and a development of terrestrial vegetation in the catchment. Between 7700 and 5900 cal yr BP, TOC and TN were fluctuating at higher concentrations and C/N maintained high ratios, while delta C-13 increased in its value and delta N-15 remained at low values, denoting a further rise in lake level and a notable improvement of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Around 5900 cal yr BP, TOC and TN concentrations, C/N ratios and delta C-13 values decreased abruptly, while delta N-15 value increased rapidly, implying dramatic drops in lake level and water temperature and drastic declines of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Subsequently all geochemical proxies increased in their values until 4850 cal yr BP, indicating a gradual hydrological and ecological recovery. From 4850 to 750 cal yr BP, decreasing trends of TOC and TN concentrations and C/N ratios and increasing trends of delta C-13 and delta N-15 values denote a general decline in the hydrological and ecological conditions. The last 750 cal yrs witnessed the pattern of hydrological and ecological changes occurring from 5900 to 4850 cal yr BP. We suggest that hydrological and ecological changes in the EASM margin during the Holocene were closely related to the combined effects of regional precipitation and temperature which were ultimately controlled by the Northern Hemisphere summer insolation, the boundary conditions and the physical environment of ocean current.

J	Hruska, J; Laudon, H; Johnson, CE; Köhler, S; Bishop, K				Hruska, J; Laudon, H; Johnson, CE; Köhler, S; Bishop, K			Acid/base character of organic acids in a boreal stream during snowmelt	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												In northern regions, spring snowmelt generally results in an episodic decline of surface water pH. Natural organic acids may be an important factor in this type of pH change. We studied the variations in the acid/base character of aquatic organic acids during spring snowmelt in 1997 at Svartberget, a stream rich in total organic carbon (TOC) that is located in the boreal zone of northern Sweden. Snowmelt at Svartberget was accompanied by a drop in stream pH of up to 1.8 pH units, as well as the dilution of base cation and strong acid anion concentrations. Aluminum and TOC increased or decreased during snowmelt, depending on the sampling site within the 50-ha catchment. Although there were distinct differences in pH, TOC, and major inorganic ions in the runoff from three subcatchments, there was very little variation in the acid/base character of TOC. Thus organic acids in the Svartberget catchment share a common set of acid/base properties despite markedly different subcatchment drainage patterns, vegetation, and soils. The dissociation behavior of organic acids at Svartberget could be described with high precision (R-2 = 0.91, P < 0.001, and n = 115) by a triprotic acid analog model (pK(al) = 2.5, pK(a2) = 4.0, and pK(a3) = 5.8), together with the measured site density of organic acids (8.6 <plus/minus> 0.8 mu eq (mg TOC)(-1)), A Gaussian pK(a) distribution (mu = 4.20 and sigma = 1.43) predicted organic acid dissociation with similar precision (R-2 = 0.91, p < 0.001, and n = 94). Variations in site density among the tributary streams could largely be explained by aluminum complexation. Sites with lower measured site densities had greater concentrations of organically bound Ai. Thus Al binding reduces the potential release or neutralization of H+ by organic acids.

Correlation analysis between historical oxygen isotope values and winter vortex latitude shows an inverse relationship wherein an expanded vortex is associated with high delta O-18(calcite) values, and vice versa. An expansion of the vortex favors advection of cyclones from the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic regions characterized by high delta O-18(precipitation) values, whereas a contracted vortex favors the development of cross-continental storms originating in the Pacific, which preferentially rain out O-18 as they propagate eastward. We hypothesize that changes in the size of the winter vortex every 20-30 yr over the past 1000 yr modify the primary source regions for meteoric precipitation. We propose two possible climate forcings to explain our hypothesis: an external forcing related to solar variability and an internal forcing related to ocean-atmosphere links.

This study explores vegetation and rainfall and associated changes in atmospheric circulation during the past 26,000 years in Wallacea, a biogeographical area in central Indonesia, wedged between the Sunda and Sahul shelves and known for its exceptionally high rainforest biodiversity. We use terrestrial plant biomarkers from sediment cores retrieved from Mandar Bay, off west Sulawesi, to reconstruct changes in Wallacean vegetation and climate since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Enriched leaf wax carbon isotope (delta C-13(wax)) values recorded in Mandar Bay during the LGM, together with other regional vegetation records, document grassland expansion, implying a regionally dry, and possibly more seasonal, glacial climate. Depleted leaf wax deuterium isotope (delta D-wax) values in Mandar Bay during the LGM, and low reconstructed precipitation isotope compositions from nearby sites, reveal an intensified Austral-Asian summer monsoon circulation and a southward shift of the mean position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, likely due to strong southern hemisphere summer insolation and the presence of large northern hemisphere ice sheets. Mandar Bay delta C-13(wax) was anti-correlated with delta D-wax during the LGM and the last deglaciation, but was positively correlated during most of the Holocene, indicating time-varying controls on the isotopic composition of rainfall in this region. The inundation event of the Sunda Shelf and in particular the opening of the Java Sea and Karimata Strait between 9.4 and 11.1 thousand years ago might have provided new moisture sources for regional convection and/or influenced moisture source trajectories, providing the trigger for shifts in atmospheric circulation and the controls on precipitation isotope compositions from the LGM to the Holocene.

J	Straile, D				Straile, Dietmar			Zooplankton biomass dynamics in oligotrophic versus eutrophic conditions: a test of the PEG model	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												The model of the International Society of Limnology (SIL) Plankton Ecology working group (hereafter the PEG model) is a verbal model describing the patterns and driving factors of seasonal phytoplankton and zooplankton succession in oligotrophic and eutrophic lakes (Sommer etal., 1986). Despite being a citation classic, tests of the PEG model with respect to differences in zooplankton biomass dynamics between oligotrophic and eutrophic lakes are lacking. Here, I use the long-term data from Lake Constance, which during the last 100year changed from an (ultra-) oligotrophic lake to a eutrophic lake and back to an oligotrophic lake to analyse trophic status differences in zooplankton biomass seasonality. Using data from one lake allows one to study trophic influences on biomass dynamics without the confounding effects of lake geographical setting and lake morphology, which complicate comparative dynamics in eutrophic versus oligotrophic lakes. However, environmental changes due to other driving factors, for example climate change, may possibly alter biomass dynamics as well. Data from Lake Constance do not support the differences in zooplankton seasonality in respect to peak timing between eutrophic and oligotrophic lakes suggested by the PEG model. Rather total zooplankton biomass, as well as cladoceran and copepod biomass showed a peak in May/June during all trophic conditions. Biomass dynamics of cladocerans during spring were more strongly influenced by water temperature than by trophic state. Furthermore, analyses of the geographical setting of the lakes considered in Sommer etal. (1986) suggest that the proposed differences in zooplankton seasonality between eutrophic and oligotrophic lakes are at least partially due to the confounding effect of lake altitudinal setting; the oligotrophic lakes were located at higher altitude than the eutrophic lakes. As a consequence of the results from Lake Constance, and the bias detected in the Sommer etal. (1986) study, a modified PEG model is proposed which considers low water temperature and not food limitation as the most important factor reducing zooplankton growth rate during early spring in both oligotrophic and eutrophic lakes.

J	Persson, J; Hakanson, L				Persson, J; Hakanson, L			A simple empirical model to predict deepwater turnover time in coastal waters	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Deepwater turnover time is an important variable for coastal management because it regulates fluxes of nutrients and oxygen consumption. The aim of this study was to develop a model to predict mean or characteristic deepwater turnover time in nontidal Baltic areas for the summer period. It is hypothesized that morphometry governs the exchange of deep water. Empirical data were collected during summer from 15 relatively small areas with varying topography. Deepwater turnover time was determined from the dispersal of a fluorescent dye, Statistical relationships between deepwater turnover time and morphometric parameters, determined using a digital technique, were calculated using multivariate methods. The results show that 82% of the variation in deepwater turnover time among the areas can be statistically explained by the mean filter factor, the topographic openness, and the mean slope. The mean filter factor describes how an archipelago acts as an energy filter, and openness describes the exposure of the coastal area.																			0706-652X					JUN	1996	53	6					1236	1245		10.1139/cjfas-53-6-1236	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-53-6-1236													WOS:A1996VP79900003

The rise and fall of methanotrophy following a deepwater oil-well blowout	NATURE GEOSCIENCE												The blowout of the Macondo oil well in the Gulf of Mexico in April 2010 injected up to 500,000 tonnes of natural gas, mainly methane, into the deep sea(1). Most of the methane released was thought to have been consumed by marine microbes between July and August 2010(2,3). Here, we report spatially extensive measurements of methane concentrations and oxidation rates in the nine months following the spill. We show that although gas- rich deepwater plumes were a short- lived feature, water column concentrations of methane remained above background levels throughout the rest of the year. Rates of microbial methane oxidation peaked in the deepwater plumes in May and early June, coincident with a rapid rise in the abundance of known and new methane- oxidizing microbes. At this time, rates of methane oxidation reached up to 5,900 nmol l(-1) d(-1)-the highest rates documented in the global pelagic ocean before the blowout(4). Rates of methane oxidation fell to less than 50 nmol l(-1) d(-1) in late June, and continued to decline throughout the remainder of the year. We suggest the precipitous drop in methane consumption in late June, despite the persistence of methane in the water column, underscores the important role that physiological and environmental factors play in constraining the activity of methane- oxidizing bacteria in the Gulf of Mexico.					; Orphan, Victoria/AAS-5989-2020; Amon, Rainer/F-2524-2018; Battles, John/G-8233-2012; Diercks, Arne/AAA-2341-2022; Montoya, Joseph/C-3115-2013; Villareal, Tracy/I-9462-2012; Wood, Angela/GZA-5762-2022; Orphan, Victoria Jeanne/K-1002-2014; Battles, John J./G-8233-2012	Meile, Christof/0000-0002-0825-4596; Joye, Samantha/0000-0003-1610-451X; Montoya, Joseph/0000-0001-7197-4660; Bracco, Annalisa/0000-0002-1619-6103; Shiller, Alan/0000-0002-2068-7909; Diercks, Arne R/0000-0002-7313-6983; Orphan, Victoria Jeanne/0000-0002-5374-6178; Battles, John J./0000-0001-7124-7893; Villareal, Tracy/0000-0002-5717-8163													1752-0894	1752-0908				JUN	2014	7	6					423	427		10.1038/NGEO2156	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/NGEO2156													WOS:000337164400013
J	BARTOW, JA				BARTOW, JA			TUFFACEOUS EPHEMERAL LAKE DEPOSITS ON AN ALLUVIAL PLAIN, MIDDLE TERTIARY OF CENTRAL CALIFORNIA	SEDIMENTOLOGY												The Oligocene and Miocene Valley Springs Formation is one element in the middle to late Cenozoic alluvial fill of the Central Valley of California and represents a large fluvial depositional system that extended westward from sediment-filled palaeovalleys in the high Sierra Nevada to a piedmont alluvial plain under the present Central Valley. The Valley Springs Formation consists largely of tuffaceous mudrock, tuffaceous sandstone, polymict conglomerate and rhyodacitic tuff. The most prominent lithofacies in the formation is yellowish grey or greyish yellow, tuffaceous mudstone and claystone characterized by crude, commonly wavy layering or bedding, an irregular fracture, and common clay-lined partings, fissures, and small branching tubules. Petrographic and X-ray diffraction analyses of the composition, texture, fabric, mineralogy and organic content of an 8 m thick section of the tuffaceous mudrock lithofacies have provided evidence for an origin quite different from the earlier interpretations of this lithofacies as altered tuffs. Numerous rounded mudstone or claystone clasts in a detrital mud matrix, together with abundant freshwater microfossils (megaspores, chrysophyte cysts, diatoms and sponge spicules), indicates that the lithofacies is a mostly epiclastic sedimentary deposit. Root traces, fissuring, orientated clay skins lining pores and secondary surfaces, and mineralogical data are evidence of periodic exposure and desiccation. The tuffaceous mudrock lithofacies of the Valley Springs Formation, interpreted in the context of the middle to lower regions of a piedmont alluvial system, most probably represents a complex of ephemeral lake and marsh environments on a low gradient alluvial plain. The inferred abundance of shallow lakes, ponds and marshes implies a climate that was wetter than the semi-arid climate of the region today.																			0037-0746					APR	1994	41	2					215	232		10.1111/j.1365-3091.1994.tb01402.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3091.1994.tb01402.x													WOS:A1994NF67900003
J	Watmough, S				Watmough, Shaun			An assessment of the Ca weathering sources to surface waters on the Precambrian Shield in central Ontario	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												There is increasing concern over the negative ecological impacts caused by falling calcium (Ca) concentrations in lakes, particularly in central Ontario, Canada. Forecasting regional changes in lake Ca concentrations relies on accurate estimates ofmineral weathering rates that are not widely available. In this study, bulk atmospheric deposition, surface water and soil chemistry along with Sr-87/Sr-86 isotope measurements were used to provide regional insight into weathering controls on Ca concentrations in lakes. Regionally, Ca concentrations in 90% of 129 lakes sampled in central Ontario were <0.1 mmol L-1 and the Ca/Sr ratio in lakes increased and the K/Sr ratio decreased with increasing Sr concentration, which is indicative of greater Ca sources from calcite or apatite in the higher Ca lakes. Significant relationships between Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios and Ca/Sr rations in dilute acid (0.1 M HCl) soil extracts are also indicative of the presence of trace amounts of calcite or apatite in surficial soils. Within the low (<0.7mmol L-1) Ca lakes, defined in this study that are considered most at risk from falling Ca concentrations, Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios fell within the range observed in weak acid soil extracts and were also significantly related to Ca/Na and K/Sr ratios in surface waters. There were large inconsistencies however, between Ca/Na ratios and Ca/Sr in surface waters and soil acid extracts that suggest differences in Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios in surface waters of the low Ca lakes do not simply reflect differences in Ca derived from non-silicate minerals in surficial soils and that that Ca sources from deeper soil or bedrock are also important contributors to surface water Ca in these low Ca lakes.

FISHING OF THE POPULATION OF NORTH-WESTERN LADOGA REGION IN THE MIDDLE AGES ACCORDING TO ARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE	VESTNIK PERMSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-ISTORIYA-PERM UNIVERSITY HERALD-HISTORY												The paper considers fishing gear discovered at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries and earlier during the excavations of medieval Karelian hill forts in the North-Western Ladoga region (Russia). Karelian fortresses are situated in the fjord shore of Lake Ladoga and date back to the 12th - early 15th century. Ladoga is the largest freshwater lake in Europe and is known for its unique fish fauna built during the geological formation of the lake. Since the period of the first settlement, Lake Ladoga has played an essential role in natural resources management of the local population. Fishing was a key industry among local people almost until modern times. The set of archaeological artifacts includes findings made of non-ferrous metal and iron (hooks and spoon hooks, harpoons, spears, etc.), stone (net and fishing rod sinkers) and clay (net sinker). The functional analysis of the tools evidences the variety of fishing techniques: use of nets, hook gears, spear tools, etc. According to their functional destination, the findings are divided into three groups. The first group is presented by hook gears: hooks (4) and spoon hooks (9). Massive hooks might belong to trot line or bottom fishing tackle. Among spoon hooks, seasonal (winter and summer) lures may be distinguished. The second group - spear tools - includes harpoons (4) and three-pronged spears (2), used for spearfishing. Unfortunately, ancient nets produced of organic materials were not preserved in aggressive Karelian soils, but the use of nets are marked in the findings of net sinkers made of stone (39) and clay (1). Stone sinkers are presented by round pebbles that used to be wrapped in birch bark, which facilitates its attachment to the net. Clay sinker (1) is barrel-shaped with a hole inside. One more sinker, small and made of cleaving stone, is appeared to be a part of fishing rod gear. Obviously, ancient Karelians also practiced fishing with traps: written sources mention fish bow nets (Russian 'versha'). Wide range of findings and the presence of specialized seasonal baits illustrate the high level of traditional fishing industry of ancient Karelians. The abundance of fishing terminology in the toponymic material of North-Western Ladoga region proves the broad involvement of Karelians in that field.					kochkurkina, svetlana/AAH-3770-2021; Summanen, Irina/ABC-2472-2020														2219-3111						2020	48	1					50	61		10.17072/2219-3111-2020-1-50-61	http://dx.doi.org/10.17072/2219-3111-2020-1-50-61													WOS:000589794700004

For vegetation and irrigation, the timing of the snowmelt is crucial. Therefore, it is necessary to understand how snowmelt varies under different local conditions. While differences in slope aspect and vegetation (individually) were linked to differences in snow accumulation and ablation, this study connects the two and describes their influence on the soil moisture response to snowmelt. This research focuses on the catchment of the "Brunnenkopfh & uuml;tte" (BKH) in Bavaria, southern Germany, where an automatic weather station (AWS) has operated since 2016. In addition, soil temperature and moisture monitoring systems in the surrounding area on a south aspect slope on an open field (SO), on a south aspect slope in the forest (SF), and a north aspect slope in the forest (NF) have operated since 2020. On snow-free days in winter, the soil temperature at the SF site was on average 1 degrees C lower than on the open site. At the NF site, this soil temperature difference increased to 2.3 degrees C. At the same time, for a 1 degrees C increase in the air temperature, the soil temperature increases by 0.35 degrees C at the NF site. In addition, at this site, snow cover disappeared approximately one week later than on the south aspect slopes. Snow cover at the SF site disappeared even earlier than at the SO site. Finally, a significant difference in the soil moisture response was found between the sites. While the vegetation cover dampens the magnitude of the soil moisture increases, at the NF site, no sharp increases in soil moisture were observed.

Construction of a causeway in the central part of the lake after 1989 has divided the lake into northern and southern parts and caused an extreme change of the lake hydrochemical system. Precipitation of evaporite minerals as crust on the lake floor was caused by the combination of lake level fall and increasing water salinity. However, some parameters controlling rates of salt deposition and dissolution and temporal and spatial variation in salt thickness in Lake Urmia are poorly understood. This study reviews 90 sediment cores from various parts of the lake to put forward a better understanding of the salt depositional system and salt thickness variations in the basin for the last 40 years (1977-2017). Our results indicate that the sedimentary system of Urmia Lake changed rapidly during the last two decades from a permanent hypersaline lake with predominantly fast terrigenous-biochemical sedimentation to a seasonally changing playa sedimentary environment with predominance of evaporite minerals. These changes are responsible for rapid salt deposition that generated a salt-crust with a maximum thickness of 2.95 m overlying Holocene terrigenous sediments. The salt-crust thickness and the water depth have a positive correlation for water depth greater than 1 meter, which means that salt-crust thickness increases where water depth increases. While the thickness of shallow deposits are affected by fresh-water dissolution. In addition, the average salt precipitation rate in the northern and the southern parts of the lake is 466 and 266 times higher, respectively, than the average (0.3 mm/y) sedimentation rate before the lake shrinkage. Similar to other large hypersaline lakes such as the Great Salt Lake (USA) and the Aral Sea (Central Asia), the manmade intervention at Urmia Lake (damming of the catchment, extension of agricultural fields, and causeway construction in the middle part of the lake) threatens its further hydrologic existence.

Cosmogenic 3He production rates in apatite, zircon and pyroxene inferred from Bonneville flood erosional surfaces	QUATERNARY GEOCHRONOLOGY												He-3 concentrations were measured in zircon, apatite and pyroxene separates from rhyolite surfaces along the Snake River near Twin Falls, Idaho. These fluted and potholed surfaces were presumably scoured by the Bonneville outburst flood similar to 17.5 ka. Several of the samples contain inherited He-3 from prior exposure, reflecting the complex incision history of the Snake River canyon and suggesting earlier flood events. Each individual mineral from the remaining surfaces yielded He-3 concentrations that are within error of each other. He-3 produced by neutron capture on Li-6 was established from shielded samples and a simple neutron production model. The remaining He-3 is spallogenic and was used to calibrate the production rate of cosmogenic He-3 in zircon, apatite and pyroxene by assuming minimal erosion since the Bonneville flood. In all three phases the resulting production rates are similar to 7-12% lower than previous He-3 production rate estimates obtained by reference to various production rates for Be-10 in quartz. This disagreement is partially reconciled here by recalculating previous results with a Be-10 production rate of 4.51 at g(-1) a(-1) in quartz. Adopting this revised rate brings three independent He-3 production rate estimates for zircon and apatite into agreement within 5%, with grand means of 103 +/- 3 at g(-1) a(-1) in zircon and 133 +/- 6 at g(-1) a(-1) in apatite. The major source of uncertainty in cosmogenic He-3 dating of these phases is now correction for He-3 produced by neutron capture on Li-6. Calculations are presented for assessing the amount of uncertainty introduced by this correction as a function of Li concentration, cosmic-ray exposure age, and He closure age. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

J	Lalk, E; Velez, A; Ono, S				Lalk, Ellen; Velez, Amber; Ono, Shuhei			Methane Clumped Isotopologue Variability from Ebullition in a Mid-latitude Lake	ACS EARTH AND SPACE CHEMISTRY												Methane is a greenhouse gas and is an important component of carbon cycling in freshwater environments. Isotope ratios of methane (C-13/C-12 and D/H) are used extensively as tracers to identify methane sources. Recent advances in the measurement of clumped methane isotopologues ((CH3D)-C-13, (CH2D2)-C-12) offer new opportunities to constrain sources and sinks of atmospheric methane. Previous measurements of clumped methane isotopologues from freshwater environments have been spatially and temporally limited. The abundance of (CH3D)-C-13 and methane flux from ebullition in the deep basin of Upper Mystic Lake were measured from May to November 2021 to characterize the source isotopologue signatures and methane fluxes for mid-latitude lakes. The trends in delta C-13 and delta D values support decreased methane oxidation in the early summer compared to fall. The Delta(CH3D)-C-13 values from this study range from 2.0 to 4.2 parts per thousand, reflecting methane oxidation occurring anaerobically in lake sediments and euxinic bottom waters at sample sites. The relatively large variation in the Delta(CH3D)-C-13 values observed within this lake basin aligns with previous observations of bubbles from arctic lakes. The values of Delta(CH3D)-C-13 do not correlate with methane flux, suggesting that Delta(CH3D)-C-13 measurements from background ebullition are not sensitive as a proxy for ebullition rates. This study presents a uniquely large (n = 40) set of freshwater Delta(CH3D)-C-13 values from a single lake basin, which we use to recommend a sampling strategy of >= 9 samples to constrain the Delta(CH3D)-C-13 source signal within similar to 0.5 parts per thousand from similar environments. This data demonstrates the utility of clumped methane isotopologues to gain insights into local biogeochemical processes from field studies and points to the challenge of using clumped isotopologue measurements to constrain global freshwater-methane sources to the atmosphere.

J	Kumar, A; Yang, T; Sharma, MP				Kumar, Amit; Yang, Tao; Sharma, M. P.			Greenhouse gas measurement from Chinese freshwater bodies: A review	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												Freshwater bodies are found as significant sources of greenhouse gas to the atmosphere, but their quantitative significance is not yet clear. The rapid increase in hydropower dams and associated emissions has received much attention from hydropower industries, environmentalists, and policymakers from across the globe. The tropical subtropical eco-regions are, particularly, considered as hotspots from greenhouse gas production point of view as the emitted gases are playing a critical role in climate change. The present paper reviews the uncertainty and limitations of greenhouse gas measurement from Chinese freshwater bodies based on available data. Literature reported that carbon dioxide emission from Chinese lakes falls in the range of 0.01-2.16 mu mol m(-2)s(-1) except for Poyang Lake. The CO2 emission from Chinese hydropower reservoirs is estimated as 0.15-1.11, while for rivers, it is 0.44-4.12 mu mol m(-2)s(-1) The methane and nitrous oxide emissions are, however, found less than carbon dioxide emission. The CO2 emission falls in the range of -0.17-0.54 and 1.08-1.70, respectively higher than global lakes and rivers, while the global reservoirs have emission in the range of -0.17-2.98 mu mol m(-2)s(-1). The paper also reports the challenges in the estimation and prediction of greenhouse gas emissions from hydropower reservoirs along with suggested mitigation measures. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

J	NIENHUIS, PH; DEBREE, BHH				NIENHUIS, PH; DEBREE, BHH			CARBON FIXATION AND CHLOROPHYLL IN BOTTOM SEDIMENTS OF BRACKISH LAKE GREVELINGEN, THE NETHERLANDS	NETHERLANDS JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH												Chlorophyll a concentrations in the upper 10 cm (sliced per cm) of Lake Grevelingen sediments are given for 1977-1980. Chlorophyll a in the upper cm of the bottom varied between 20-400 mg .cntdot. m-2. Average values in 1-3 m deep sandy and silty-sandy stations amounted to 67.5-82.2 mg .cntdot. m-2 in the upper cm. A 7 m deep silty station contained on an average 42.7 mg .cntdot. m-2 chlorophyll a in the upper cm of the sediment. Both within year and year-to-year variations were large. A restricted number of phaeopigment data for 1977 revealed an average phaeopigment-chlorophyll a ratio of 0.03 (sand) to 0.39 (silt). Particulate organic C [POC] measured in 1977 and 1978 in the top cm of the sediment showed annual average values ranging between 0.2 and 0.7% of sediment dry weight. 14C fixation data in the light, as measured in a laboratory incubator, are given for 1979 and1980, with highest values during summer (200-500 mg C .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. day-1) and lower values in winter. Integrated annual values give average 14C fixation estimates per station, ranging between 47 g C .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. yr-1 and 71 g C .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. yr-1, with a variation coefficient of 35 to 49% of the mean. Average 14C dark fixation values varied between 13 and 27% of average light fixation values. An arbitrarily and tentatively derived net microphytobenthos primary production estimate for entire Lake Grevelingen amounts to 35 g C .cntdot. m-2 for 1979 and 32 g C .cntdot. m-2 for 1980. The relationship between POC and chlorophyll a concentration was sometimes significant, between annual chlorophyll a concentration and light fixation values it was not. A literature comparison between the 14C and the O2 exchange method leads to the conclusion that both methods have serious drawbacks when applied to benthic systems.																			0077-7579						1984	18	3-4					337	359		10.1016/0077-7579(84)90009-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0077-7579(84)90009-7													WOS:A1984ASJ2800009

The current academic community still has disputes on whether LA was the capital of Loulan Kingdom, the time of its rise, peak and decline, and the process, rate and driving mechanism of human activity change. This study uses the radio carbon dates (14C) database of LA to reconstruct the history of the rise and fall of human activity, and finds that LA experienced more than similar to 500 years from its rise to its peak and then to its decline: 1) the city rose rapidly, and the population increased rapidly from similar to A.D. 0 to 230; 2) the city was prosperous and flourishing, and the intensity of human activity reached its peak from similar to A.D. 160 to 340, especially in similar to A.D. 230, when the population reached its peak; 3) the city accelerated its decline, and the intensity of human activity decreased significantly, and the population shrank rapidly from similar to A.D. 230 to 500; 4) LA was completely abandoned after similar to A.D. 560. The results of the 14C dating database do not support that LA was the early capital of the Loulan Kingdom. By comparing the human activity record of LA with the existing high-resolution palaeoclimate records in the surrounding mountainous areas of the Tarim Basin and South Asia, it is found that the superposition of centennial-scale westerly circulation strength events and the similar to 500-year cycle of the Indian monsoon jointly controlled the precipitation and meltwater (snow) supply of the mountains in the Tarim Basin, affecting the changes of surface runoff and oasis area in the basin, which is one of the important factors causing the rise and fall of LA.

J	Kalinowska, K; Grabowska, M				Kalinowska, Krystyna; Grabowska, Magdalena			Autotrophic and heterotrophic plankton under ice in a eutrophic temperate lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Ice cover can considerably influence the food web structure and dynamics of lake ecosystems during winter. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that, due to unfavourable conditions, abundances of planktonic organisms are low under ice. The components of the microbial loop (nanoflagellates, ciliates) and the classical food web (algae, rotifers, crustaceans) were investigated in a eutrophic lake from January to April, at 7-day intervals. The phytoplankton was dominated by the mixotrophic chrysophyte Synura uvella, which formed an intense phytoplankton bloom. Nanoflagellates (mostly heterotrophic forms) and ciliates (oligotrichs, prostomatids) were present in relatively high numbers. Rotifers were represented by the algivorous taxa (Notholca squamula, Polyarthra dolichoptera) and reached surprisingly high abundances. There were no significant correlations between physical parameters and protists, but correlations were apparent between the thickness of the ice and the numbers of cyanobacteria, diatoms (negative) and chrysophytes (positive). The absence of crustaceans and relationships between rotifers and both algae and nanoflagellates indicate that these groups were probably a crucial factor determining the abundance and composition of the rotifer community. These results suggest that the microbial loop had a central role in the functioning of the ecosystem under ice in this eutrophic lake.

The iron-rich paleosol occurs chiefly overlying different Upper Cretaceous rocks, particularly the red clay of the Campanian Quseir Formation at the Dakhla Oasis or the Cenomanian Sabaya Formation at the Kharga Oasis. The iron-rich paleosols consist mainly of massive yellow goethite-rich beds with high concentrations of Fe( OH). The presence of high Fe/Mn ratio with a wide range of variation indicates that the sources of the iron-rich paleosols are from the discharge of iron-rich Nubian Aquifer water controlled largely by localized fractures which formed spring mounds deposited of Pleistocene age. These mounds were exposed to subaerial weathering that resulted in the formation of lateritic goethite ore during tropical climatic periods. There is evidence of hydrothermal vents ( hot spring) such as found native Au, magnetite. and high concentrations of zirconium, cobalt. and vanadium. In the depositional history of Mut and Zayat ironstones, four main processes will be clarified as follows: ( 1) the syn-depositional, ( 2) diagenetic, ( 3) hot spring processes, and ( 4) post-diagenetic ( soil formation). At the end, the high Fe2O3 concentrations and replacement of lithic fragments by microcrystalline goethite indicate that the Dakhla-Kharga sedimentary rocks were subjected to ferrugination. These alterations thought to be result of either post-depositional hydrothermal alteration or syn-depositional interaction with seawater at low temperatures or some combination of the two processes.					; El-Desoky, Hatem/AAW-7245-2020	, Sherif/0000-0003-1133-7461; 													1866-7511	1866-7538				FEB	2017	10	4							74	10.1007/s12517-017-2853-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12517-017-2853-z													WOS:000396880600001

We also performed a complementary predation experiment to separate the effects of predation from climate-driven changes. We show that recruitment from the sediment is crucial for shaping the rotifer community and that an elevated temperature will likely advance the recruitment peak resulting in an earlier rotifer peak abundance in spring. However, increased predator abundances, also resulting from elevated temperatures, counteracted the climate driven increase in rotifer recruitment and thereby hampered the pelagic establishment of rotifers. We show further that different rotifer genera respond differently to these increased predation pressure due to selective predation by copepods and taxa-specific protection morphologies and behaviors of rotifers. However, with the exception of one taxon, the effects from brownification were negligible, compared to effects imposed by elevated temperatures. We conclude, therefore, that future rotifer dynamics will be affected both directly through elevated temperatures and indirectly by increased predation.

This research applies artificial intelligence-based GWPM to the surroundings of Urmia Lake (Iran) which, unfortunately, has been facing severe drying in recent years. An artificial neural network (ANN) is assisted by an optimization algorithm, namely the water-cycle algorithm (WCA) to spatially analyze the relationship between environmental factors and the presence of springs. The proposed model goes through an iterative course to find the optimal contribution of the environment to the GWP within the study area. The results indicated the promising capability of the WCA-ANN for analyzing the spring patterns and also producing reliable GWPMs. Moreover, the WCA outperformed three benchmark algorithms called political optimizer (PO), equilibrium optimization (EO), and electrostatic discharge algorithm (ESDA). Area under the curve values of 0.761, 0.757, 0.801, and 0.767, as well as mean absolute errors of 0.205, 0.203, 0.186, and 0.201, respectively, have been obtained for the PO-ANN, EO-ANN, WCA-ANN, and ESDA-ANN. These outcomes indicate the greater competency of the proposed algorithm. The WCA-ANN and ESDA-ANN algorithms are both therefore recommended as capable methodologies for GWPM. Besides, the maps suggested in this study may help overcoming the Urmia Lake crisis by identifying wealthy groundwater resources in the nearby.					; Scaioni, Marco/Y-4398-2018; Ghasemieh, Hoda/KHT-6832-2024; MOUSAVI TAYEBI, SEYED ALI/GZG-2825-2022; Mehrabi, Mohammad/ABE-8979-2021	Mehrabi, Mohammad/0000-0002-3843-0503; MOUSAVI TAYEBI, SEYED ALI/0000-0002-3394-7888; 													1436-3240	1436-3259				MAY	2023	37	5					1821	1838		10.1007/s00477-022-02368-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00477-022-02368-y		DEC 2022											WOS:000903317200001

Existing ice-drilling technologies make it cumbersome to maintain microbiologically clean access for sample acquisition and environmental stewardship of potentially fragile subglacial aquatic ecosystems. The IceMole is a maneuverable subsurface ice probe for clean in situ analysis and sampling of glacial ice and subglacial materials. The design is based on the novel concept of combining melting and mechanical propulsion. It can change melting direction by differential heating of the melting head and optional side-wall heaters. The first two prototypes were successfully tested between 2010 and 2012 on glaciers in Switzerland and Iceland. They demonstrated downward, horizontal and upward melting, as well as curve driving and dirt layer penetration. A more advanced probe is currently under development as part of the Enceladus Explorer (EnEx) project. It offers systems for obstacle avoidance, target detection, and navigation in ice.

Assessing the vulnerability of endemic diatom species in Lake Baikal to predicted future climate change: a multivariate approach	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Diatoms in Lake Baikal exhibit significant spatial variation, related to prevailing climate, lake morphology and fluvial input into the lake. Here we have assessed the threats to endemic planktonic diatom species (through the development of empirical models), which form a major component of primary production within the lake. Multivariate techniques employed include redundancy analysis (RDA) and Huisman-Olff-Fresco (HOF) models. Our analyses suggest that eight environmental variables were significant in explaining diatom distribution across the lake, and in order of importance these are snow thickness on the ice, water depth, duration of days with white ice, suspended matter in the lake, days of total ice duration, temperature of the water surface in July, concentration of zooplankton and suspended organic matter. Impacts on dominant phytoplankton diatom species are highlighted using t-value biplots. Predictions of future climate change on Lake Baikal are likely to result in shorter periods of ice cover, decreased snow cover across the lake in spring, increased fluvial input into the lake, and an increase in the intensification of surface water stratification during summer months. All these factors are likely to impact negatively on the slow-growing, cold-water endemics such as Aulacoseira baicalensis and Cyclotella minuta, which currently dominate diatom assemblages. Instead, taxa that are only intermittently abundant, at present, in offshore areas (e.g. Stephanodiscus meyerii) are likely to become more frequent. However, given the climatic gradient across the lake, the timing and extent of changes in community structure are likely to vary. Moreover, palaeolimnological records show that Lake Baikal diatom assemblages have been dynamic throughout the Holocene, with both endemic and cosmopolitan species exhibiting periods of dominance. Effects of climate change on the entire lake ecosystem may yet be profound as the structure of the pelagic food web may change from one based on endemic diatom taxa to one dominated by nondiatom picoplankton, and as limnological functioning (e.g. stratification and mixing) affects deepwater oxygen availability, nutrient cycling and trophic linkages.

The bloom overlapped the peak seasonal contributions of the dominant mesozooplankton herbivores in the region, the copepods Acartia bifilosa and Eurytemora affinis and the cladoceran Bosmina longispina maritima. Using radio-labelling techniques, the copepods were offered one of the cyanobacteria, Nodularia, as well as the 10-54 mum fraction of the natural phytoplankton assemblage. In general, incorporation rates of the labelled phytoplankton into the copepods declined with increasing contributions of the cyanobacteria. For both copepods, incorporation was inversely related to total phytoplankton biomass, whether measured as chlorophyll, total cells or cyanobacteria biomass. The very low rates for Acartia (< 0.8 mul [copepod h]-1) indicated that this copepod was likely starving in the cyanobacteria bloom, consistent with the generally poor condition of the animal observed in the laboratory. The other major mesozooplanktor, B. longispina maritima, ingested substantially more cyanobacterial biomass than the two copepods, based on HPLC-identified cyanobacteria-specific pigment echinenone in the gut. Bloom carbon provided < 1% and < 4% of the daily rations for Acartia and Eurytemora, respectively. Total copepod demand in the cyanobacteria blooms was trivial, < 1% of bloom biomass consumed daily. These results suggest that copepod herbivory is relatively unimportant in dissipating summer cyanobacteria blooms in the Gulf of Finland.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV 25	1994	293						249	254		10.1007/BF00229948	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00229948													WOS:A1994QG90200034

Here, we show seven seasonal drought events that occurred during the relatively warm interstadials by phytolith and pollen records. These events are significantly manifested as high percentages of bilobate phytoliths and are consistent with the large zonal sea-surface temperature (SST) gradient from the western to eastern tropical Pacific, suggesting that the reduction in seasonal precipitation could be interpreted by westward shifts of the western Pacific subtropical high triggered by changes of zonal SST gradient over the tropical Pacific and Hadley circulation in the Northern Hemisphere. Our findings highlight that both zonal and meridional ocean-atmosphere circulations, rather than solely the Intertropical Convergence Zone or El Nino-Southern Oscillation, controlled the hydrologic changes in tropical East Asia during the last glaciation.

This study examines long-term terrestrial water storage anomalies (TWSA) in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area (TGRA) over two decades, from 2003 to 2023. The analysis utilizes data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and its successor mission (GRACE-FO), complemented by Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) models and ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) datasets. The research methodically explores the comparative contributions of natural factors and human activities to the region's hydrological dynamics. By integrating the GRACE Drought Severity Index (GRACE-DSI), this study uncovers the dynamics of droughts during extreme climate events. It also reveals the pivotal role of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) in mitigating these events and managing regional water resources. Our findings indicate a notable upward trend in TWSA within the TGRA, with an annual increase of 0.93 cm/year. This trend is largely due to the effective regulatory operations of TGD. The dam effectively balances the seasonal distribution of water storage between summer and winter and substantially reduces the adverse effects of extreme droughts on regional water resources. Further, the GRACE-DSI analysis underscores the swift recovery of TWSA following the 2022 drought, highlighting TGD's critical role in responding to extreme climatic conditions. Through correlation analysis, it was found that compared with natural factors (correlation 0.62), human activities (correlation 0.91) exhibit a higher relative contribution to TWSA variability. The human-induced contributions were derived from the difference between GRACE and GLDAS datasets, capturing the combined effects of all human activities, including the operations of the TGD, agricultural irrigation, and urbanization. However, the TGD serves as a key regulatory facility that significantly influences regional water resource dynamics, particularly in mitigating extreme climatic events. This study provides a scientific basis for water resource management in the TGRA and similar large reservoir regions, emphasizing the necessity of integrating the interactions between human activities and natural factors in basin management strategies.					; Zhong, Yulong/X-6893-2019; WU, Yunlong/LCD-7795-2024; WU, XIAOHUI/NHO-8747-2025; Wu, Yunlong/LCD-7795-2024	Zhong, Yulong/0000-0002-6172-2598; Wu, Yunlong/0000-0002-5487-5078; liu, su lan/0009-0009-3013-3190; Zhang, Yi/0000-0003-1006-6372														2072-4292				MAR	2025	17	5							901	10.3390/rs17050901	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs17050901													WOS:001442474000001

This research was conducted to investigate the effects of elevated CO2, elevated temperature, and the interaction of the elevated CO2 and temperature on the soil available phosphorus (P) of a paddy-wheat rotation in the Taihu Lake region, China. Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was cultivated during the study period from 2011 to 2014 at two CO2 levels (350 mu L.L-1 ambient and 500 mu L.L-1 elevated by 150 mu L.L-1) and two temperatures (ambient and 2 degrees C above the ambient). Soil available P content increased at the first season and decreased at the last season during the three wheat growing seasons. Soil available P content showed seasonal variation, whereas dynamic changes were not significant within each growing season. Soil available P content had no obvious trends under different treatments. But for the elevated temperature, CO2, and their combination treatments, soil available P content decreased in a long time period. During the period of wheat ripening stage, significant positive correlations were found between soil available P content and saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) and organic matter, but significant negative correlations with soil clay content and pH value; the correlation coefficients were 0.9400 (p < 0.01), 0.9942 (p < 0.01), -0.9383 (p < 0.01), and -0.6403 (p < 0.05), respectively. Therefore, Ks, organic matter, soil clay, and pH were the major impact factors on soil available P content. These results can provide a basis for predicting the trend of soil available P variation, as well as guidance for managing the soil nutrients and best fertilization practices in the future climate change scenario.

Biodegradability of dissolved organic carbon in permafrost soils and aquatic systems: a meta-analysis	BIOGEOSCIENCES												As Arctic regions warm and frozen soils thaw, the large organic carbon pool stored in permafrost becomes increasingly vulnerable to decomposition or transport. The transfer of newly mobilized carbon to the atmosphere and its potential influence upon climate change will largely depend on the degradability of carbon delivered to aquatic ecosystems. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is a key regulator of aquatic metabolism, yet knowledge of the mechanistic controls on DOC biodegradability is currently poor due to a scarcity of long-term data sets, limited spatial coverage of available data, and methodological diversity. Here, we performed parallel biodegradable DOC (BDOC) experiments at six Arctic sites (16 experiments) using a standardized incubation protocol to examine the effect of methodological differences commonly used in the literature. We also synthesized results from 14 aquatic and soil leachate BDOC studies from across the circum-arctic permafrost region to examine panarctic trends in BDOC. An increasing extent of permafrost across the landscape resulted in higher DOC losses in both soil and aquatic systems. We hypothesize that the unique composition of (yedoma) permafrost-derived DOC combined with limited prior microbial processing due to low soil temperature and relatively short flow path lengths and transport times, contributed to a higher overall terrestrial and freshwater DOC loss. Additionally, we found that the fraction of BDOC decreased moving down the fluvial network in continuous permafrost regions, i.e. from streams to large rivers, suggesting that highly biodegradable DOC is lost in headwater streams. We also observed a seasonal (January-December) decrease in BDOC in large streams and rivers, but saw no apparent change in smaller streams or soil leachates. We attribute this seasonal change to a combination of factors including shifts in carbon source, changing DOC residence time related to increasing thaw-depth, increasing water temperatures later in the summer, as well as decreasing hydrologic connectivity between soils and surface water as the thaw season progresses. Our results suggest that future climate warming-induced shifts of continuous permafrost into discontinuous permafrost regions could affect the degradation potential of thaw-released DOC, the amount of BDOC, as well as its variability throughout the Arctic summer. We lastly recommend a standardized BDOC protocol to facilitate the comparison of future work and improve our knowledge of processing and transport of DOC in a changing Arctic.					; Mann, Paul/H-7268-2014; Spencer, Robert/ADE-1993-2022; Vonk, Jorien/H-5422-2011; Treat, Claire/P-7160-2018; Abbott, Benjamin/G-1733-2017; Wickland, Kimberly/AAU-2963-2021; Tank, Suzanne/I-4816-2012	Wickland, Kimberly/0000-0002-6400-0590; Mann, Paul/0000-0002-6221-3533; Vonk, Jorien/0000-0002-1206-5878; Treat, Claire/0000-0002-1225-8178; Abbott, Benjamin/0000-0001-5861-3481; Tank, Suzanne/0000-0002-5371-6577													1726-4170	1726-4189					2015	12	23					6915	6930		10.5194/bg-12-6915-2015	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-12-6915-2015													WOS:000365901800006

The lampricide 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol causes temporarymetabolic disturbances in juvenile lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens): implications for sea lamprey control and fish conservation	CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY												The pesticide 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol ( TFM) is applied to rivers and streams draining into the Laurentian Great Lakes to control populations of invasive sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), which are ongoing threats to fisheries during the lamprey's hematophagous, parasitic juvenile life stage. While TFM targets larval sea lamprey during treatments, threatened populations of juvenile lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens), particularly young-of-the-year (<100 mm in length), may be adversely affected by TFM when their habitats overlap with larval sea lamprey. Exposure to TFM causes marked reductions in tissue glycogen and high energy phosphagens in lamprey and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) by interfering with oxidative ATP production in the mitochondria. To test that environmentally relevant concentrations of TFM would similarly affect juvenile lake sturgeon, we exposed them to the larval sea lamprey minimum lethal concentration (9-h LC99.9), which mimicked concentrations of a typical lampricide application and quantified energy stores and metabolites in the carcass, liver and brain. Exposure to TFM reduced brain ATP, PCr and glycogen by 50-60%, while lactate increased by 45-50% at 6 and 9 h. A rapid and sustained depletion of liver glucose and glycogen of more than 50% was also observed, whereas the respective concentrations of ATP and glycogen were reduced by 60% and 80% after 9 h, along with higher lactate and a slight metabolic acidosis (similar to 0.1 pH unit). We conclude that exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of TFMcauses metabolic disturbances in lake sturgeon that can lead to impaired physiological performance and, in some cases, mortality. Our observations support practices such as delaying TFMtreatments to late summer/fall or using alternative TFMapplication strategies to mitigate non-target effects in waters where lake sturgeon are present. These actions would help to conserve this historically and culturally significant species in the Great Lakes.																			2051-1434					SEP 8	2021	9								coab069	10.1093/conphys/coab069	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/conphys/coab069		SEP 2021						34512991					WOS:000722546500001

Impacts of hydrological alteration on ecosystem services changes of a large river-connected lake (Poyang Lake), China	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Large lakes provide various types of ecosystem services (ESs), of which stocks and variations induced by hy-drological alterations are largely unquantified. The present study investigates the long-term changes of five key ESs (i.e., flood regulation, water supply, fish production, nutrient retention and biodiversity conservation) in a large river connected lake (Poyang Lake), with special attention to impacts of hydrological alteration induced by the Three Gorges Dam (TGD). Hydrological data series, hydrodynamic model, the nutrient balance, fishery statistics, and wetland winter waterbird survey data from 1980 to 2016 were employed. Results showed that Poyang Lake provide significant ESs, with long-term average flood regulation, water supply and nutrient retention services of 167.7 x 10(8 )m(3), 31.53 x 10(8) m(3), and 15.12% of total phosphorus load, respectively. The fish production service ranged from 1.74 x 10(4)t to 7.19 x 10(4)t, with an average value of 3.12 x 10(4)t. All five key ESs exhibited a downward trend since the 2000s, especially for water supply, fish production and nutrient retention services (p < 0.05), which might be largely attributed to the hydrological condition changes induced by TGD operation. Nevertheless, more detailed monitoring data and biophysical models are required to further acknowledge the changes in biodiversity conservation and fish production services and their linkages with the TGD. The present study sheds light on long-term ES changes in large lakes and their possible linkages with human influences through hydropower projects.

Variation in snowpack depth and density was low within each site, indicative of relatively homogeneous snow conditions. Snow density was negatively correlated with tree stem density. For the Hoarfrost River area, both snow depth and variability in snow density increased with tree stem density. Variability in snow depth increased with variability in snow density. Snow depth was more variable in forest-tundra than in forest sites.

J	Holuszko, JD; Bowen, CA II				Holuszko, JD; Bowen, CA II			Status of lake trout rehabilitation on Six Fathom Bank and Yankee reef in Lake Huron	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Six Fathom Bank, an offshore reef in the central region of Lake Huron's main basin, was stocked annually with hatchery-reared lake trout Salvelinus namaycush during 1985-1998, and nearby Yankee Reef was stocked with hatchery-reared lake trout in 1992, 1997, and annually during 1999-2001. We conducted gill-net surveys during spring and fall to evaluate performances of each of the various strains of lake trout, as well as the performance of the entire take trout population (all strains pooled), on these two offshore reefs during 1992-2000. Criteria to evaluate performance included the proportion of "wild" fish within the population, spawner density, adult survival, growth, maturity, and wounding rate by sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus. Although naturally reproduced age-0 lake trout fry were caught on Six Fathom Bank and Yankee Reef, wild lake trout did not recruit to the adult population to any detectable degree. The density of spawning lake trout on Six Fathom Bank (>100 fish/305 m of gill net) during 1995-1998 appeared to be sufficiently high to initiate a self-sustaining population. However, annual mortality estimates for all lake trout strains pooled from catch curve analyses ranged from 0.48 to 0.62, well exceeding the target level of 0.40 suggested for lake trout rehabilitation. Annual mortality rate for the Seneca Lake strain (0.34) was significantly lower than that for the Superior-Marquette (0.69) and Lewis Lake (0.69) strains. This disparity in survival among strains was probably attributable to the lower sea-lamprey-induced mortality experienced by the Seneca Lake strain. The relatively high mortality experienced by adult lake trout partly contributed to the lack of successful natural recruitment to the adult population on these offshore reefs, but other factors were probably also involved. We recommend that both stocking of the Seneca Lake strain and enhanced efforts to reduce sea lamprey abundance in Lake Huron be continued.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				AUG	2004	24	3					1003	1016		10.1577/M03-140.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M03-140.1													WOS:000223531200023

In this study, we examined the diversity of autosporic coccoid algae from under ice in the shallow lakes of Arrowwood National Wildlife Refuge, North Dakota. Coccoid algae were isolated from phytoplankton samples collected during three consecutive winters (1994-1997) at four sites in three lakes. Seventy-five isolates were examined by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of photosynthetic pigments, specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers, and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism of the 18S rDNA. Thirteen 18S rDNA types of coccoid Trebouxiophyceae, three types of coccoid Chlorophyceae and one type of coccoid eustigmatophyte were detected. One of the green algae was tentatively identified as Mychonastes homosphaera; the other green algae are probably undescribed species. These results indicate a much higher level of diversity in coccoid green algae than has been reported in regional floras.																			0031-8884					NOV	2000	39	6					498	506		10.2216/i0031-8884-39-6-498.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.2216/i0031-8884-39-6-498.1													WOS:000167448700004
J	Terzic, E; Gardiol, C; Vilibic, I				Terzic, Elena; Gardiol, Clara; Vilibic, Ivica			Surface saline lakes in the Mediterranean Sea	OCEAN SCIENCE												In the Levantine basin, it has long been known that salinity can reach a maximum in a thin layer near the surface, particularly during the warm season when summer heating, evaporation, and low mixing prevail. This water mass has been linked to the generation of Levantine intermediate and deep waters, depending on winter heat loss and wind-induced mixing. However, a recent study demonstrated that similar conditions, referred to as surface saline lakes (SSLs), can occur as far north as the Adriatic Sea. To investigate this, we analysed data from Argo profiling floats across all of the Mediterranean basins, focusing on the upper layers (up to 200 m in depth), where such lakes are known to form. We developed an objective algorithm to detect SSLs within profiles, defining a SSL according to a threshold-exceeding salinity gradient at its base. This definition allowed us to estimate SSL depth, SSL temperature and potential density (PDA) gradients at the base, as well as the Schmidt stability index which quantifies the energy needed to mix a SSL. We also ensured the quasi-continuity of Argo profiles throughout the year in our analyses, as SSLs are highly seasonal phenomena. SSLs exhibit minimum or vanishing occurrences between February and April and peak between August and October. SSLs were detected in all of the Mediterranean basins, with the highest prevalence - 65 %-70 % of the profiles between July and December - occurring in the Levantine basin. During the August-October peak, SSLs exceeded 35 % of the monthly profiles in each basin, even in the western Mediterranean, albeit with lower overall salinity levels and variable SSL ranges. These findings underscore the role of the atmospheric heat and water exchange in all of the Mediterranean basins, influencing intermediate and deeper thermohaline properties through wintertime mixing. Despite pronounced interannual and seasonal variability, our analysis of the data showed a significant positive trend in SSL depth, accompanied by decreasing thermohaline gradients (temperature, salinity, and PDA) at SSL bases through the investigated period. The observed changes raise questions about their drivers - whether they indicate ongoing climate-change-induced salinization and shifts in Mediterranean water mass dynamics or are merely manifestations of a multi-decadal variability.

Peculiarities of the atmospheric blocking events over the Siberia and Russian Far East region during summertime	23RD INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEAN OPTICS: ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS	Proceedings of SPIE				23rd International Symposium on Atmospheric and Ocean Optics - Atmospheric Physics	JUL 03-07, 2017	Irkutsk, RUSSIA	Russian Acad Sci, Siberian Branch, V E Zuev Inst Atmospher Opt, Russian Acad Sci, Siberian Branch, Inst Solar Terrestrial Phys, Fed Agcy Sci Org, Russian Fdn Basic Res				We study the atmospheric blocking event evolution peculiarities over the Siberia and Far Eastern region (Russia) during summertime. Compared are two methods to identify blockings: from the 500 hPa (Z500) isobaric surface height distribution, and from the potential temperature at the dynamic tropopause (PV-theta) for every July 1979 through 2016. We revealed the situations, where blockings are identified only in one of the characteristics. Blocking identification by the PV-theta characteristics is complicated in the cases, when its cyclonic part appears to be filled with air masses of the southern origin, due to which there is no meridional gradient reversal in the PV-theta region. In the Z500 region, the difficulties to identify blocking events may arise in those cases, when the baric field fails to adapt to rapid changes in the temperature field associated with the air mass advection. For example, such events often occur over the ocean surface. We performed a synoptic analysis for several blocking events from the data on the velocity field dynamics at 850 hP. and PV-theta supplemented by the analysis of the observational rainfall data at the stations during those events. Distinguished were several stages of the blocking evolution over the Siberia and Far Eastern region that involved air masses from the East Asian summer monsoon region: 1. The formation of a blocking over Western Siberia; 2. Cold inflow on the blocking eastern periphery, the East Asian summer monsoon front activation, and a cyclone formation (east of Lake Baikal), in whose system the monsoon air was actively involved. Such monsoon cyclones, as a rule, are deep long-living formations, and they bring abnormal precipitations; 3. The formation of a ridge or anticyclone east of the monsoon cyclone, caused by the advection of the same monsoon flow, whose part is involved in a cyclone system. In general, the East Asian summer monsoon influence comes to the effects of regeneration and intensification of the blocking circulating systems. Those effects are often accompanied by strong droughts in some regions and floods in others.

Development of larvae occurred all year but peak larval densities occurred in February, July, and November and indicated several generations with longest generation times in the autumn. Emergence occurred all year and a bimodal diel emergence pattern was apparent at certain times. K. chapmani larvae were present in the stream drift at all times but not in high densities, and generally only during daylight hours with an early morning/late afternoon drift pattern. K. chapmani exhibits a generally non-seasonal life history but rapid growth tends to occur when conditions of temperature and food quality are likely to be optimal resulting in shorter generation times and peaks in larval populations.																			0028-8330					SEP	1999	33	3					351	359		10.1080/00288330.1999.9516882	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1999.9516882													WOS:000083091200003

Although this anomaly is attributed to precessional forcing leading to a strong enhancement of the African monsoon, no climate model so far has been able to simulate the full extent of vegetation in the Sahara region 6000 years ago. Here two atmospheric general circulation models (LMD 5.3 and ECHAM 3) are asynchronously coupled to an equilibrium biogeography model to give steady-state simulations of climate and vegetation 6000 years ago, including biogeophysical feedback. The two model results are surprisingly different, and neither is fully realistic. ECHAM shows a large northward extension of vegetation in the western Dart of the Sahara only. LMD shows a much smaller and more zonal vegetation shift. These results are unaffected by the choice of 'green' or modern initial conditions. The inability of LMD to sustain a 'green' Sahara 6000 years ago is linked to the simulated strength of the tropical summer circulation. During the northern summer monsoon season, the meridional gradient of sea-level pressure and subsidence over the western Dart of northern Africa al-e both much weaker in ECHAM than in LMD in the present as well as the mid-Holocene. These features allow the surface moist air flux to penetrate further into northern Africa in ECHAM than in LMD. This comparison illustrates the importance of correct simulation of atmospheric circulation features for the sensitivity of climate models to changes in radiative forcing, particularly for regional climates where atmospheric changes are amplified by biosphere-atmosphere feedbacks.					de NOBLET, Nathalie/O-8613-2015														0930-7575	1432-0894				SEP	2000	16	9					643	659		10.1007/s003820000074	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s003820000074													WOS:000089304300001
J	Verhille, CE; Farrell, AP				Verhille, Christine E.; Farrell, Anthony P.			Endurance Swimming Is Related to Summer Lake Survival of Rainbow Trout in a Warm Lake with Avian Piscivores	FISHES												Fitness of fish is assumed to be influenced by locomotion performance, but empirical evidence linking swimming capacity to survival in nature remains sparse. Poor triploid (3N) fish aerobic swimming performance in conjunction with production of sibling diploid (2N) and 3N populations of genetically identical origin to minimize variability among compared populations make 3N trout an informative system to test hypotheses about fitness consequences of fish locomotion. Here, we ask if reduced survival of 3N relative to 2N trout in natural ecosystems during periods of high temperature relate to a lower aerobic swimming capacity and aerobic scope of 3N compared with 2N conspecifics. Three-yearly cohorts of conspecific 2N and 3N hatchery-reared, yearling rainbow trout were ranked for swimming endurance, externally marked for their endurance quantile, and then stocked into two lakes as yearlings to quantify their survival in the wild over summer as a function of ploidy, temperature and endurance; all while tracking temperature and depth habitat utilization via telemetry. As expected, 3N swimming endurance was lower than that of 2N, but with considerable individual overlap. Aerobic swimming endurance, especially for 3N, was predictive of summer survival in a warm lake where piscivorous birds potentially exerted high predation pressure, resulting in low fish survival. This empirical evidence of a connection between swimming endurance and fitness provides support for long held assumptions of this relationship and could inform future sport fishing stocking industry practices to match fish strains to ideal habitats.					; verhille, christine/AAF-9341-2020	verhille, christine/0000-0001-5453-7792; 														2410-3888				APR	2023	8	4							213	10.3390/fishes8040213	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fishes8040213													WOS:000977976400001

To doubts and questions raised by Chen et al., we give further explanations and provide more relevant evidences. The water temperature stratification existed in Lake Yangzonghai in summer, and affected by which arsenic concentration with water depth was uneven and peaked in the bottom layer in summer. In the case of adding carbon source (glucose) and maintaining anerobic state, enhanced microbial activity promoted the release of arsenic from sediment to water which was observed in the laboratory experiments. Errors might exist in sampling, determination and calculation, but they would not change the main conclusions of the article. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Here, we present oxygen (delta O-18) and carbon (delta O-13) isotope data from carbonate over the upper 243 m of a composite core profile recovered as part of the Scientific Collaboration on Past Speciation Conditions in Lake Ohrid (SCOP-SCO) project. The investigated sediment succession covers the past ca. 637 ka. Previous studies on short cores from the lake (up to 15 m, < 140 ka) have indicated the total inorganic carbon (TIC) content of sediments to be highly sensitive to climate change over the last glacial-interglacial cycle. Sediments corresponding to warmer periods contain abundant endogenic calcite; however, an overall low TIC content in glacial sediments is punctuated by discrete bands of early diagenetic authigenic siderite. Isotope measurements on endogenic calcite (delta O-18(c) and delta C-13(c) ) reveal variations both between and within interglacials that suggest the lake has been subject to palaeoenvironmental change on orbital and millennial timescales. We also measured isotope ratios from authigenic siderite (delta O-18(s) and delta C-13(s)) and, with the oxygen isotope composition of calcite and siderite, reconstruct delta O-18 of lake water (delta O-18(lw)) over the last 637 ka. Interglacials have higher delta O-18(lw) values when compared to glacial periods most likely due to changes in evaporation, summer temperature, the proportion of winter precipitation (snowfall), and inflow from adjacent Lake Prespa. The isotope stratigraphy suggests Lake Ohrid experienced a period of general stability from marine isotope stage (MIS) 15 to MIS 13, highlighting MIS 14 as a particularly warm glacial. Climate conditions became progressively wetter during MIS 11 and MIS 9. Interglacial periods after MIS 9 are characterised by increasingly evaporated and drier conditions through MIS 7, MIS 5, and the Holocene. Our results provide new evidence for long-term climate change in the northern Mediterranean region, which will form the basis to better understand the influence of major environmental events on biological evolution within Lake Ohrid.

The maturation of the females starts at 4+ years; the peak of their spawning activity is observed at 5+. Males mature 1 year earlier than females. In summer, in the ovaries of mature females, the older generation of germ cells is represented by oocytes at the phase of the cytoplasm vacuolization; the younger generation of cells is represented by numerous previtellogenous oocytes. The peak of spermatogenesis is observed in the testes. Significant pathomorphological changes are revealed in the gill epithelium which inhibit the respiratory function. Weakly expressed liver congestion and moderate basophilia of hepatocytes both indicate normal conditions in this lake.					; Nekrasov, Innokentiy/AAD-7396-2022	Shuman, Leonid/0000-0002-1286-3757; 													1995-0829	1995-0837				MAR	2021	14	2					150	158		10.1134/S1995082921020115	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1995082921020115													WOS:000644646100004

The species is of particular concern because it appears to be spreading throughout temperate North America and produces toxins that Can have serious effects on human health. Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii was found in Constance Lake, Ottawa, Ontario, a shallow rnesotrophic to eutrophic hardwater lake (Summer average total phosphorus 28-48 mug l(-1)) where bottom waters can reach sufficiently high temperatures to promote germination of resting stages in the sediments. Peak abundance and biomass occurred in July and August when Surface water temperatures were at their maximum. Year to year differences in abundance and dominance over four years Of sampling (1998-2001) appeared to be due principally to differences in water temperature rather than nutrients. In the summer of 1998 when biomass was highest over the four years, C. raciborskii contributed 63 % of the total phytoplankton biomass and 60 % of the cyanobacterial biomass. A warming trend linked to climate change is likely to accelerate the spread and abundance of this potentially toxic species.

An intensive field measurement of the current velocity, salinity, dissolved oxygen and phosphorus concentrations was carried out during the summertime of 2007, and the field data were used for the construction and verification of models. For the calculation of the advective and diffusive water flow rates in Inohana Lake system, the box model was constructed based on the mass balance of water and salt. The comparison between the modeled and ADCP-measured water flow rates shows that the model is capable of providing a good estimation of the summer-averaged water flow rates. The DO model was constructed using the advective and diffusive flow rates calculated by the box model and the measurements, which also shows a good estimation of the DO concentration under the stratified condition in Inohana Lake estuary.																					978-981-4287-96-8				2010							315	+																WOS:000275056900039
J	Li, Y; Peng, SM				Li, Yu; Peng, Si-min			Ecological and hydrologic evolution history in the sensitive zone of both East Asian summer monsoon and Westerly since the Last Glacial Maximum	JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE												The Qilian Mountains, located in the northeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, is a sensitive zone of both East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) and westerly winds (WW). The evolution history and driving mechanism of the ecosystem and hydrologic cycle in this region on long-term timescales have not yet been clarified. In this study, we comprehensively study the hydrologic and ecological evolution history in the sensitive zone since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) by integrating surface sediments, paleoclimate records, TraCE-21ka transient simulations, and PMIP3-CMIP5 multi-model simulation. Results show that hydrologic and ecological proxies from surface sediments are significantly different from west to east and mainly divided into three sections: the monsoon-affected region in the eastern Qilian Mountains, the intersection region in the central Qilian Mountains, and the westerly-affected region in the western Qilian Mountains. Meanwhile, paleo-ecological and paleohydrologic reconstructions from the surroundings uncover a synchronous climate evolution that the EASM mainly controls the eastern Qilian Mountains and penetrates the central Qilian Mountains in monsoon intensity maximum, while the WW dominates the central and western Qilian Mountains on both glacial-interglacial and millennial timescales. The simulation results further bear out the glacial humid climate in the central and western Qilian Mountains caused by the enhanced WW, and the humidity maximum in the eastern Qilian Mountains controlled by the strong mid-Holocene monsoon. In general, east-west differences in climate pattern and response for the EASM and the WW are integrally stable on both short-term and long-term timescales.																			1672-6316	1993-0321				MAY	2023	20	5					1266	1281		10.1007/s11629-022-7851-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-022-7851-2													WOS:001001382100006

Consisting of closed-loop of pipes immersed in seawater, CHEs are devised for extraction or injection of thermal energy from/into the seawater. A mathematical model has been established and solved analytically to describe the heat transfer process of CHEs in summer. An experimental system has been built to simulate the heat transfer process. The experimental results show that the relative error of the temperature distributions along the CHEs between the experimental data and numerical simulation result is less than 5%. As a result, the mathematical model can be applied to optimization analysis of the CHEs used for SWHP systems.																			1951-6851		978-94-62520-59-2				2015	121						1482	1486																WOS:000359441300298

A novel technique to improve capture success of common ravens	HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS												Traditional trapping techniques for common ravens (Corvus corax; raven) require significant effort, often produce low capture rates, and cannot be used in some situations. We designed a 3-m noose pole to secure ravens from nocturnal roost locations while using a strobe spotlight to temporarily disorient them. We collected measures of trapping efficiency and contrasted them with padded leghold traps also used in the study. We effectively implemented our noose pole method in July and August of 2018, 2019, and 2020 in the Baker and Cow Lakes sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) Priority Areas of Conservation in eastern Oregon, USA, which yielded trapping efficiency of 0.48 trap-hours/ raven (37 total captured ravens). Our trapping efficiency using leghold traps during the same summer months was 76.42 trap-hours/raven (3 total captured ravens). Our new trapping method constitutes an inexpensive and simple way to safely trap ravens at accessible communal roosts and merits further refinement to increase utility and capitalize on the vulnerability of ravens to capture at night.

Late Quaternary environmental changes in Helambu Himal, Central Nepal, recorded in the diatom flora assemblage composition and geochemistry of Lake Panch Pokhari	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												This study presents changes in diatom flora assemblage composition, TOC, TOC/N and biogenic opal in a 450 cm core of Lake Panch Pokhari, Central Nepal (4,050 m asl), indicating Late Quaternary environmental fluctuations. Four Diatom Zones (DZ) were detected, with two major changes. The first one was found in similar to 430 cm depth (similar to 14.8 cal. kyr BP), where the original flora characterized by Navicula digitulus Hustedt, Pinnularia rhombarea Krammer, P. aff. viridiformis var. minor Krammer, Encyonema silesiacum (Bleisch) D. G. Mann, Cymbopleura naviculiformis (Auerswald) Krammer and Nitzschia sp. was fully replaced by an assemblage consisting of Aulacoseira alpigena (Grunow) Krammer, Diatoma hyemalis (Roth) Heib., Tabellaria flocculosa (Ehrenberg) Kutzing, Brachysira brebissonii Ross and Pinnularia subgibba Krammer, creating a stable diatom assemblage for similar to 8 kyr (DZ3). The second change was found at similar to 70 cm (similar to 2.1 cal. kyr BP) when increased nutrient inputs lead to emergence of new taxa such as Fragilaria construens var. subsalina Hustedt, F. tenera (W. Smith) Lange-Bertalot, Eunotia cf. pseudopapilio Lange-Bertalot and M. Norpel-Schempp and Gomphonema subclavatum Grunow. In order to evaluate the past environmental conditions in the Lake Panch Pokhari, the detected diatom taxa were subjected to analyses of their autecological preferences and dominance within the specific assemblage. We also assumed that TOC/N ratios > 10 indicate accelerated erosion due to the strengthening of the Summer Monsoon starting at similar to 14.8 and between 13.7 and 12.8 cal. kyr BP. Monsoon intensity was most pronounced during the Early Holocene and at the beginning of the Late Holocene. The fluctuations of TOC and TOC/N in the Late Glacial sediments seem to correlate temporally and climatically with oscillations in the Northern Atlantic region.

J	Hazer, O; Kartal, S				Hazer, Orhan; Kartal, Senol			Use of amidoximated hydrogel for removal and recovery of U(VI) ion from water samples	TALANTA												Poly(acrylamidoxime-co-2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid) (PAMSA) hydrogel was prepared by copolymerization of acrylonitrile and 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid as monomer, N,N'-methylenebis(acrylamide) as crosslinking agent and potassium peroxodisulfate as initiator. Amidoximated copolymer network was prepared by the reaction of copolymer network with hydroxylamine hydrochloride. A batch procedure was used for the determination of the characteristics of the U(VI) solid phase extraction from the amidoximated hydrogel. The determination of U(VI) was performed by spectrophotometric method using arsenazo-III as complexing agent. Optimal pH value for the quantitative preconcentration was 3, and full desorption was achieved with 3 mol L-1 HClO4. The adsorption process can be well described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, and the equilibrium adsorption isotherm was closely fitted with the Langmuir model. A preconcentration factor of 20 and the three sigma detection limit of 2.8 mu g L-1 (n = 20) were achieved for uranium(VI) ions. The PAMSA hydrogel was used for separating and preconcentrating the uranyl ion existing in sea water samples, thermal spring water samples and the certified reference materials (TMDA 64; fortified lake water sample).

The biology and control of tall whitetop are summarized in this paper. The weed was first positively identified in the Lake Tahoe Basin in 1997. with anecdotal reports of infestation dating back to the 1980s. Lake Tahoe is a unique national treasure famed for its unusual water clarity and surrounding beauty. Pressures from development and urbanization have resulted in an accelerated rate of eutrophication and resultant algal growth. Current research suggests that the lake is phosphorus limited, with erosion and sediment transport increasing phosphorus loads to the lake. Because tall whitetop has the potential to destroy sensitive streamside environment zones that are essential to the protection of Lake Tahoe's clarity, an effort was begun immediately to locate and map the weed throughout the Basin. A public awareness campaign was mounted by the University of Nevada Cooperative Extension. Local media ran stories on radio, television, and in local newspapers. and posters were placed in strategic locations. The public was asked to report suspected locations of the weed. From these reports, 35 tall whitetop infested sites in the Tahoe Basin were identified, confirmed and mapped. The size of these infestations ranges from one plant to 0.2 hectare. Many of these sites fall within priority 1 and 2 watersheds critical to preserving the Lake's water clarity. The current phase involves the implementation of site-specific control recommendations developed with the assistance of USDA/ARS. Local residents have been urged to "Adopt-a-Spot" for long-term monitoring of control efforts. Permission was received to apply chlorsulfuron in appropriate sites during the summer of 1999. and approximately 70% of the tall whitetop has been treated Basin-wide to date.																					90-5782-080-3				2001							303	310																WOS:000170231900032

In this study, the MOD10 daily swath imagery (MOD10-L2) and the MODIS cloud mask (MOD35) were validated in the Lower Great Lakes Region, specifically the area to the east of Lake Michigan. Validation of the MOD10_L2 snow product, MOD35 cloud mask and the MOD10_L2 Liberal Cloud Mask was performed using field observations from K-12 student GLOBE (Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment) and SATELLITES (Students And Teachers Evaluating Local Landscapes to Interpret The Earth from Space) programs. Student data consisted of field observations of snow depth, snow water equivalency, cloud type, and total cloud cover. In addition, observations from the National Weather Service (NWS) Cooperative Observing Stations were used. Student observations were taken during field campaigns in the winter of 2001-2002, a winter with very little snow in the Great Lakes region, and the winters of 2000-2001 and 2002-2003, which had significant snow cover. Validation of the MOD10_L2 version 4 snow product with student observations produced an accuracy of 92% while comparison with the NWS stations produced an accuracy of 86%. The higher NWS error appears to come from forested areas. Twenty-five and fifty percent of the errors observed by the students and NWS stations, respectively, occurred when there was only a trace of snow. In addition, 82% of the MODIS cloud masked pixels were identified as either overcast or broken by the student observers while 74% of the pixels the MODIS cloud mask identified as cloudless were identified as clear, isolated or scattered cloud cover by the student observers. The experimental Liberal Cloud Mask eliminated some common errors associated with the MOD35 cloud mask, however, it was found to omit significant cloud cover. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

About 2 .times. 106 ha are ploughed annually each autumn in southern Ontario, exposing about 11% of resident earthworms, 37% of which were injured by ploughing. Many of the 7000 000 ring-billed gulls (Larus delawarensis Ord.) living adjacent to these cultivated fields in the Great Lakes Basin forage on the exposed earthworms immediately behind the plough, raising concern amongst growers that earthworm populations might be vulnerable to eradication by gull predation. When the huge renewable, dispersed and cryptic earthworm resource was compared with the much smaller food requirements of the Ontario gull flock, and with the relatively few days during the ploughing season that the flock has to forage on the earthworm resource, it should be inferred that the current gull flock poses no danger to earthworm populations in cultivated southern Ontario soils.																			0167-8809	1873-2305				JUN	1988	20	3					165	173		10.1016/0167-8809(88)90108-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0167-8809(88)90108-9													WOS:A1988P115500002

Multidisciplinary studies in southeastern China have shown that the summer monsoon intensity declined in the mid-late Holocene. We present a high-resolution pollen record of the last 4000 cal yr BP in Jinggang Mts of Jiangxi Province, southeastern China. The identified pollen taxa from the core can be statistically divided into three groups corresponding to evergreen, deciduous and wetland communities. The transitions between evergreen and deciduous-coniferous pollen associations is likely caused by temperature fluctuations, indicating that climate was relatively cool at 3800-3200 cal yr BP and 2200-1300 cal yr BP and warmer at 32002800 cal yr BP and 1300-800 cal yr BP. The vegetation study suggests that an Alnus-dominant association represents a secondary forest that usually takes place and expand after repeated forest fires. The charcoal concentration from the core depicts at least six major forest fire events since 4000 cal yr BP, most of which were followed by the development of an Alnus forest community. This result suggests that the EASM weakened toward the late Holocene and that its related decrease in moisture led to large forest wildfires. Furthermore, the rapid formation of a swamp and the subsequent development of the Alnus wetland community at similar to 550 cal yr BP suggest a gradual drying up of the lake, which was likely related to "the Little Ice Age". As a result of a substantial burning related to an intensification of the human cultivation practices, Alnus reached its highest values in the last 200 years along with abundant wetland herbs, pioneer ferns (mainly Dicranopteris) and high charcoal concentrations. The present evidence of several sharp floristic and climate changes coincides with either the collapse or the beginning of some Chinese dynasties, which will need further research on the relationship between natural and human cultural changes.

J	Herbert, C				Herbert, C			Relative sea level control of deposition in the Late Permian Newcastle Coal Measures of the Sydney Basin, Australia	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												Accumulation of the 400 m-thick Late Permian Newcastle Coal Measures of the Sydney Basin was controlled by changes in relative sea level. Three 3rd-order sequences, which constitute the coal measures, consist of 4th-order depositional sequences of fluvial conglomerate, coal, and small paralic/lacustrine deltas/crevasse splays, deposited on a coastal plain landward of a marine shoreline. Each 4th-order sequence was deposited during a single 4th-order relative sea level cycle. Following falls in relative sea level alluvial conglomerates derived from the New England Orogen filled incised valleys above sequence boundaries forming lowstand systems tracts. Sigmoidal conglomerates with 'giant crossbeds' were deposited as alluvial fill in compactional moats formed at the toes of abandoned paralic deltas. Alluvial sediments passed through the coastal plain directly to the marine shoreline causing the shoreface to prograde. Rising relative sea level, caused siliciclastic sedimentation to wane. During these hiatuses, in the transgressive systems tract, a rising water table stimulated peat mire growth blanketing the entire non-marine area. When the vertical accumulation of peat was outpaced by increasing rates of rising relative sea level, transgressing lagoons, interdistributary bays and lakes inundated the mires above maximum flooding surfaces. Continuing relative sea level rise in the highstand systems tracts caused paralic/lacustrine crevasse splays, crevasse subdeltas, and small deltas to prograde westwards into the Newcastle half-graben from a volcanic source on the Offshore Uplift. At this time of rising base-levels sediments were trapped on the coastal plain while the marine shoreface was starved. Falling relative sea level terminated paralic/lacustrine delta progradation and initiated exposure and erosion to repeat the cycle and initiate another 4th-order sequence. Two source areas supplied sediment into the Newcastle half-graben. An easterly source on the Offshore Uplift shed volcanic detritus into the Newcastle Coalfield via paralic/lacustrine deltas, and the New England Orogen shed volcano-lithic detritus via braided streams. The supply from the New England Orogen was switched on or increased by a fall in relative sea level while supply from the Offshore Uplift was switched off, reduced, or diverted, and vice versa during a rise in relative sea level. Increasing rates of 2nd-order falling relative sea level resulted in an upward change from predominantly marine shoreface and coastal plain sedimentation to predominantly fluvial sedimentation in the upper Newcastle Coal Measures.																			0037-0738					JAN	1997	107	3-4					167	187		10.1016/S0037-0738(96)00027-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0037-0738(96)00027-9													WOS:A1997WE54700002

Comparative summer dynamics of surface cyanobacterial communities in two connected lakes from the west of Ireland	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The eutrophication of lakes is typically associated with high biomass proliferations of potentially toxic cyanobacteria. At a regional level, the sustainable management of water resources necessitates an approach that recognises the interconnectivity of multiple water systems within river catchments. This study examined the dynamics in summer diversity of planktonic cyanobacterial communities and microcystin toxin concentrations in two inter-connected lakes from the west of Ireland prone to nutrient enrichment. DGGE analysis of 16S rRNA gene amplicons of genotype-I cyanobacteria (typically spherical) showed changes in the communities of both Lough Corrib and Ballyquirke Lough throughout the summer, and identified cyanobacterial genotypes both unique and shared to both lakes. Microcystin concentrations, estimated via the protein phosphatase 2A inhibition assay, were greater in August than in July and June in both lakes. This was concomitant to the increased occurrence of Microcystis as evidenced by DGGE band excision and subsequent sequencing and BLAST analysis. RFLP analysis of PCR amplified mcy-A/E genes clustered together the August samples of both lakes, highlighting a potential change in microcystin producers across the two lakes. Finally, the multiple factor analysis of the combined environmental data set for the two lakes highlighted the expected pattern opposing greater water temperature and chlorophyll concentration against macronutrient concentrations, but also indicated a negative relationship between microcystin concentration and cyanobacterial diversity, possibly underlining allelopathic interactions. Despite some element of connectivity, the dissimilarity in the composition of the cyanobacterial assemblages and the timing of community change in the two lakes likely were a reflexion of niche differences determined by meteorologically-forced variation in physico-chemical parameters in the two water bodies.

This was achieved by utilizing a substrate called enzyme labeled fluorescence (ELF), which forms fluorescent precipitates at the site of APA. Samples collected from Lake Erken, Sweden, were assayed with ELF and a number of species belonging to Bacillariophyceae, Chlorophyceae and Dinophyceae were labeled. Within these species we found temporal changes in the percentage of the populations that were ELF labeled. Our results demonstrate that species are not all utilizing AP at the same time, and that within one species, individual cells express different levels of APA. Comparisons between ELF activity and bulk community APA measurements, using standard methods, showed cases both of agreement and disagreement. In this study, we were unable to determine whether some of the fragile flagellates were producing AP. These cells were destroyed in the ELF-labeling process. Overall, we found that the ELF method provided new information on APA in freshwater phytoplankton, and that species-specific measurements are possible, but not for all classes of phytoplankton.					; Rengefors, Karin/K-5873-2019	Blenckner, Thorsten/0000-0002-6991-7680; Rengefors, Karin/0000-0001-6297-9734													0142-7873					APR	2001	23	4					435	443		10.1093/plankt/23.4.435	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/23.4.435													WOS:000169006800008

Reservoirs, as prevalent artificial water bodies, modify river flow and impact energy and environmental dynamics. These reservoirs can directly affect riverine ecosystems by retaining algal materials, thereby altering Chl-a concentrations in downstream water bodies. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which reservoirs influence Chl-a concentrations in rivers remain poorly understood. This study utilized Landsat 8/9 images and in-situ measurements from the Pearl River to develop a machine learning model and generate a Chl-a concentration dataset spanning 2013-2022. We also examined the mechanisms through which reservoirs and the natural environmental factors affect Chl-a concentrations by regulating the Pearl River. The findings indicate that anthropogenic factors, primarily the construction of reservoirs and dams, play a significant role in shaping the spatial distribution of riverine Chl-a concentrations along the Pearl River. As the river traverses reservoirs in the upper and middle reaches, Chl-a concentrations in both the mainstem and tributary sections exhibit a distinct decrease. The highest Chl-a concentrations were observed in the headwaters of the Xijiang River, followed by a decline in the midstream, and a subsequent increase downstream. It also revealed that, river Chl-a levels are consistently lower before entering a reservoir, higher within it, and further decreased after exiting. Reservoirs, by intercepting and storing upstream sediment and nutrients, allow only a small amounts to pass through dams into downstream sections, thereby influencing riverine Chl-a concentrations. Furthermore, Chl-a concentrations in the Pearl River peak during summer and reach their lowest levels in winter, with water temperature being the dominant driver of seasonal and interannual Chl-a variations (r = 0.88, p < 0.01). Other environmental factors such as pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), and Chl-a concentrations were found to be positively correlated. Our findings indicate that cascade reservoirs have a more significant impact on river environmental status. To effectively address river water quality degradation and maximize the benefits of reservoirs, coordinated water diversion and protective measures between the reservoirs are required.					yang, qianqian/HTM-8131-2023; Ran, Lishan/AAT-9924-2021														0301-4797	1095-8630				MAY	2025	382								125406	10.1016/j.jenvman.2025.125406	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2025.125406		APR 2025						40252418					WOS:001477549300001

In order to protect the fragile ecological environment, comprehensive harnessing projects have been carried out in many inland river basins in China, in which adopting ecological water conveyance to rehabilitate degraded terminal lakes and wetlands is an important means. From June 2014 to October 2017, the water in the upper-middle reaches of the Shiyang River Basin and the lake water of the terminal lake after ecological water conveyance was sampled. The effects of ecological water conveyance on the characteristics of surface water and groundwater were analyzed using, for example, the Piper triangle diagram, Gibbs boomerang envelope model, and mixing diagram. After ecological water conveyance, the ion concentration of water in Qingtu Lake was higher overall, and ion concentration of water in the unstable catchment was higher than that of the stable catchment. The time variation was characterized as high in the summer half year and low in the winter half year. The water of Qingtu Lake is of high and large salinity, and its hydrochemical type is Na-SO4 (Cl), which is obviously different from the water in the middle-upper reaches of the Shiyang River Basin. The effects of silicate weathering and evaporation crystallization are the main factors leading to the high ion concentration in the water of Qingtu Lake. Ecological water conveyance and the strong evaporation of arid areas have intensified the salinization of water and soils in Qingtu Lake. Meanwhile, implementing the ecological water conveyance policy in the terminal lake has also led to shortage of water resources for agricultural irrigation in the middle reaches of the Shiyang River Basin. The serial negative ecological effects of the ecological water conveyance should be emphasized.

Numerical Study of Winter Diurnal Convection Over the City of Krasnoyarsk: Effects of Non-freezing River, Undulating Fog and Steam Devils	BOUNDARY-LAYER METEOROLOGY												We performed a numerical simulation of penetrative convection of an inversion-topped weakly stratified atmospheric boundary layer over urban terrain with a strong localized source of heat and moisture. With some simplifications, the case mimics the real environment of the Krasnoyarsk region in Russia where the non-freezing river Yenisei acts as a thermal and humidity source during winter, generating an undulating fog pattern along the river accompanied with scattered 'steam devils'. An idealized full diurnal cycle was simulated using an unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) three-equation algebraic flux model and the novel buoyancy-accounting functions for treating the ground boundary conditions. The results show a significant effect of the river on the net temperature and moisture distribution. The localized heat and moisture source leads to strong horizontal convection and marked non-uniformity of humidity concentration in the air. An interplay of several distinct large-scale vortex systems leads to a wavy pattern of moisture plumes over the river. The simulations deal with rare natural phenomena and show the capability of the RANS turbulence closure to capture the main features of flow and scalar fields on an affordable, relatively coarse, computational grid.

Pesticides currently used in California's Central Valley were detected in snow and rain samples from two elevations in Sequoia National Park (SNP) in the southern Sierras. At the lower elevation site (533 m), chlorothalonil was present at the highest levels (<0.4-85 ng/L), followed by malathion (<0.046-24 ng/L), diazinon (<0.21-19 ng/L), and chlorpyrifos (1.3-4.4 ng/L). At 1,920 m elevation, chlorothalonil was also present at the highest levels (<0.57-13 ng/L) followed by diazinon (<0.057-14 ng/L), chlorpyrifos (1.1-13 ng/L), and malathion (<0.045-6 ng/L). Trifluralin, alpha- and gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), and alpha- and beta-endosulfan were also detected at both locations and at lower concentrations, generally ranging from 0.5 to 2 ng/L. In the Lake Tahoe basin, elevation 2,200 m, malathion was also found in snow at concentrations ranging from <0.046 to 18 ng/L, as was diazinon (<0.057-7 ng/L), chlorpyrifos (0.30-3.4 ng/L), and chlorothalonil (0.66-1.7 ng/L). Chlorothalonil, chlorpryifos, alpha- and gamma-HCH, and alpha-endosulfan were found in surface and deep water samples at two locations in Lake Tahoe and at concentrations similar to those found in snow within the lake basin. Lake Tahoe basin snow samples in general had lower concentrations than those from SNP. This difference in concentration levels reflects the closer proximity of downwind pesticide usage to SNP than the Lake Tahoe basin. An estimated annual loading of one chemical, chlorpyrifos, of 24 to 31 kg/year was made for the SNP land area. Comparisons of observed concentrations were made with reported aquatic toxicity and water criteria levels.

J	BAILEY, RO; TITMAN, RD				BAILEY, RO; TITMAN, RD			HABITAT USE AND FEEDING ECOLOGY OF POSTBREEDING REDHEADS	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Habitat use and feeding ecology of postbreeding redheads (A. americana) were studied at Long Island Bay and Spence Lake, Manitoba, during 1974-1977. A large variety of items was eaten, but few were important in the diet of 98 male and 25 female redheads. Plant material composed 92 and 98% of the dry aggregate weight of food consumed by males and females, respectively. Muskgrass (Chara spp.) and fennelleaf pondweed (Potamogeton pectinatus) were the most important food items. Females fed extensively on the tubers and rootstalks of pondweed during the breeding season, and muskgrass was an important food of all redheads in autumn. Habitat use by postbreeding redheads was related to the abundance of plant food resources. Drought influenced the distribution of postbreeding redheads by reducing the abundance of submergent vegetation. Lake Winnipegosis is probably the most important continental postbreeding habitat for this species because it is a large, centrally located water body on the redhead migration route that is shallow and supports dense stands of aquatic vegetation.																			0022-541X	1937-2817					1984	48	4					1144	1155		10.2307/3801775	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3801775													WOS:A1984TX75800008
J	MILLS, EL; FORNEY, JL				MILLS, EL; FORNEY, JL			IMPACT ON DAPHNIA-PULEX OF PREDATION BY YOUNG YELLOW PERCH IN ONEIDA LAKE, NEW-YORK	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The response of a D. pulex population to fluctuations in abundance of young (age-0) yellow perch P. flavescens was examined in Oneida Lake, New York, 1975-1979. Comparison of yellow perch biomass and D. pulex abundance suggested daphnid populations could tolerate predation by 10 kg of young fish.cntdot.ha-1 but reproduction could not compensate for predation when biomass of young exceeded 20-40 kg.cntdot.ha-1. Consumption by young yellow perch exceeded D. pulex production in 1975 and 1977, when daphnids disappeared, but maximum daily consumption was less than 27% of production in 1976 when daphnids were abundant through late summer. Since 1968, D. pulex populations have persisted through late summer in years when young yellow perch were scarce and disappeared when young were abundant. The decisive role of young yellow perch in the regulation of D. pulex abundance is of importance to the broader fish community in Oneida Lake.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					1983	112	2					154	161		10.1577/1548-8659(1983)112<154:IODPOP>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1983)112<154:IODPOP>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1983QM42300003

JOURNAL OF ELEMENTOLOGY												European frogbit (Hydrocharis morsus-ranae) grows mainly in stagnant, eutrophic and mesotrophic waters. It is found in various water ecosystems, but finds the optimal conditions for development in ecosystems formed with water soldier (Stratiotes abides). The shortage of detailed literature data on the properties of water bodies where European frogbit and water soldier grow has stimulated this study, whose aim has been to determine the values of selected water quality parameters and concentrations of some metals in tissues of both hydrophytes. The study was conducted in the late spring and summer of 2007 and 2008 and relied on environmental samples of water and plants (9 locations, including a field pond, a draining ditch on Pucka Isle, watercourses in Swidwie Nature Reserve, an oxbow lake of the Bug River and a flood pool near Glebokie Lake). The concentrations of N-NO3, N-NO2, N-NH4 and PO43- as well as the elements K, Na, Mg, Ca, Cd, Pb, Cu, Zn, Mn and Fe were measured in the water samples. Furthermore, the percentage of oxygen dissolved in water and the pH and electrolytic conductivity of water were determined. In order to assess the accumulation of metals by plants, the content of the same metals was measured in the water. It was determined that Hydrocharitetum morsus-ranae L. associations grow in physiochemically very diverse aquatic environments. The range of differences in the examined water quality indicators was broader for European frogbit than for water soldier. With respect to the concentration of Zn, N and P compounds, pH and the content of dissolved oxygen in water, the ranges were the same for both species. Hydrocharis morsus-ranae and Stratiotes abides differed in the accumulation of the metals. The range of the accumulation of most metals (except of K and Ca) was broader for Europen frogbit than for water soldier. In respect of Na, the range of accumulation for both plant species was the same. European frogbit spreads in water bodies in which the water is considered contaminated due to the concentrations of Cd, Pb, Cu and P.

Linking hydrologic regime, rainfall and leaf litter fall in a riverine forest within the Ramsar Site Humedales Chaco (Argentina)	ECOHYDROLOGY												The input of leaf litter from riparian vegetation could be affected by changes in precipitation and modifications to the hydrological regime. We analyse the pattern of leaf litterfall at the community scale as well as the breakdown rate in a mixed gallery forest that covers the levees of the Parana River oxbow lake. Litterfall was collected biweekly for 4 years that represents different rainfall and hydrologic regimes of the Parana River including flood and prolonged drought: 1996-1997 (PA), 1999-2000 (PB), 2005-2006 (PC) and 2007-2008 (PD). To analyse leaf breakdown, litter bags were incubated on the forest floor during flooding conditions (FFo) and dry conditions (DFo) and in the oxbow lake (FOx). The total annual leaf litterfall were 8.97, 11.15, 10.42 and 14.43 tn ha(-1) yr(-1) for PA, PB, PC and PD, respectively. Our results suggest that with the increasing severity of the dry season and decreasing hydrologic connectivity, the annual leaf litterfall increases, whereas its seasonal pattern does not change. Regardless of the seasonal pattern of rainfall and hydrological regime in each study period, leaf fall occurred throughout the year, and the peak was recorded between August and October. Leaves decomposed fastest in FOx, and the leaf breakdown on the forest floor was slower during flooding conditions than in dry conditions. Regular floods are natural occurrences that do not affect the leaf production of the Parana mixed forest, and the leaf processing depends on the oxygen concentrations. Prolonged droughts led to high annual leaf production, which is mainly processed within this forest.

Palynology of the early Miocene Foulden Maar, Otago, New Zealand: Diversity following destruction	REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY												Foulden Maar crater in Otago, southern New Zealand contains a thick sequence of earliest Miocene (similar to 23 Ma) biogenic lacustrine sediments that have preserved a rich terrestrial biota. Diverse spores and pollen recovered from a 183 m core through these sediments provide evidence of warm temperate to subtropical environments with high rainfall and cloud cover. Charcoal and burnt and dark-coloured pollen are common in reworked tephra below the lacustrine diatomite. At this early post-eruptive depositional period a diverse regional podocarp/Casuarina/ Brassospora lowland forest flora was present, with gleichenaceous ferns suggesting a locally acidic environment, possibly supporting a fire-induced fernland. The regional vegetation soon became dominated by Nothofagus (Brassospora), while a diverse subtropical forest with abundant Mallotus/Macaranga (Euphorbiaceae) developed on fertile volcanic soils around the maar. Evidence from palynomorphs combined with plant macrofossils represented in the lake sediments paints a picture of highly diverse lake margin vegetation that included rare ferns (Davallia), occasional conifers (Podocarpus and Prumnopitys), and a diverse array of monocots including at least one palm, two orchids, and species of Astelia, Cordyline, Freycinetia, Luzuriaga, Ripogonum and Typha. Overall, the vegetation close to the lake was dominated by a wide range of dicots, including Aquifoliaceae (flex), Araliaceae, Atherospermataceae (Laurelia), Chloranthaceae, Cunoniaceae, Elaeocarpaceae, Gyrostemonaceae (Gyrostemon), Lauraceae (Beilschmiedia, Cyptocatya, Litsea), Onagraceae (Fuchsia), Meliaceae (Dysoxylum), Monimiaceae (Hedycalya), Myrsinaceae, Myrtaceae, Rutaceae, Santalaceae, Sapindaceae (Cupania), Malvaceae, Strasburgeriaceae, Winteraceae and at least ten Proteaceae. Mistletoes, including several species of Loranthaceae were present. Pollens from bur reeds, bulrushes, flaxes, jointed rushes and sedges suggest that there were some swampy, shallow water edges to the generally steep-sided crater. Pollen evidence from alternate dark and light layers, regarded as being biogenic varves from sedimentology, shows no strong signal for differences in summer and winter pollen deposition. Based on palynology the age of the site is latest uppermost Rhoipites waimumuensis Zone to lower early Proteacidites isopogiformis Zone (New Zealand local stages, late Waitakian-early Otaian, similar to 23 Ma), agreeing with radiometric dates.

An improved electrochemical method was used to reliably determine Pt in estuarine conditions at trace concentrations. Platinum displayed a near-conservative behaviour along the salinity gradient of the estuary, with about 90 % remaining in the dissolved form. Extremely low concentrations of platinum in natural waters require very sensitive analytical techniques, with adsorptive cathodic stripping voltammetry (AdCSV) being one of the most frequently used techniques. A 'fine tuning' of the voltammetric parameters, along with advanced data treatment based on derivative transformations, allowed us to determine reliably Pt levels down to 50 fM (0.05 pM). By using short modulation and interval times of the differential pulse stripping waveform, and applying a 4th derivative transformation to the voltammograms, the limit of detection (LOD) was lowered down to 10 fM. Although very small concentrations of surface-active substances (e.g. 0.025 mg L-1 fulvic acid) strongly influenced the method sensitivity, recoveries of spiked samples were not impacted (similar to 100 %). The application of a desorption step (E-ds = -1.35 V; t(ds) = 2 s) at the end of the accumulation significantly improved the sensitivity, presumably through the removal of adsorbed surface-active substances. Using this optimised methodology, we determined the Pt distribution in the pristine Krka River estuary in the winter and summer periods by performing both horizontal transects and vertical profiles (salinity similar to 1 to 39). In surface waters, dissolved Pt concentrations gradually increased towards the seawater end-member (from similar to 0.15 to similar to 0.3 pM). A small deviation from the conservative mixing line was observed at salinities below 10, which may reflect changes in Pt redox speciation. In bottom waters, the trend was opposite with dissolved Pt concentrations increasing towards the freshwater end-member, probably owing to progressive accumulation related to seawater residence time. On average, 90 % of Pt was present in the dissolved form.

Total phosphorus was used as a measure of lake trophic state because: (1) phosphorus plays a central role in controlling the overall fertility of most lakes, (2) total phosphorus values are available for a great number of lakes, and (3) phosphorus is measured in a consistent manner. The maps were compiled using patterns of total phosphorus data and observed associations between these data and geographic characteristics including physiography, land use, geology, and soils. Regions depicted on the map represent areas of similarity in phosphorus concentrations in lakes, or similarity in the mosaic of values, as compared to adjacent areas. Within each region, differences in total phosphorus can be compared to natural and anthropogenic factors to determine the types of lakes representative of each region, the factors associated with differences in quality, and the realistically attainable phosphorus levels for each type of lake.																			0364-152X	1432-1009				NOV	1988	12	6					815	825		10.1007/BF01867609	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01867609													WOS:A1988R572900006

These communities represent diverse invertebrate groups which include aquatic worms, leeches, clams, snails, amphipods, crabs, aquatic mites, and insect larvae. Macrobenthic invertebrates are regarded as primary functional feeding groups in the fluvial ecosystems and an outstanding tool for monitoring the water quality. Our study aimed to investigate the community structure and diversity of macrobenthic invertebrates along with the water quality of Jhelum tributaries from Kashmir Himalaya. In the entire study, a total of 49,681 individuals of macrobenthic invertebrates were collected, belonging to 3 phyla and 51 families. The maximum abundance and richness were observed in Arthropoda followed by Mollusca and Annelida. The overall range of the Shannon-Wiener index ranged from 1.79 to 3.70 in the Aripal stream and 1.60-3.74 in the Watalara stream, which indicates a moderate clear water quality in the streams. The maximum abundance, richness, and diversity were reported in the midstream region of both tributaries and during summer and autumn seasons. The overall dataset suggests that temperature and nutrients have a major influence on the diversity, richness, and abundance of the streams. Canonical correspondence analysis revealed that the taxa show a positive correlation with temperature and nutrients indicative of tolerant and semi-tolerant families respectively whereas the taxa showing a negative correlation with nutrients and ions reflect sensitive families. The dendrogram confirmed the spatial distribution of macrobenthic invertebrate families into three categories wherein cluster-I, cluster-II, and cluster-III represent the presence of sensitive, semi-tolerant, and tolerant families, respectively. Based on the values of biotic scores, sites A1, W1, A2, and W2 lie under class I water quality with high ecological status and none to very slight organic pollution while sites A3 and W3 lie under class II water quality with good ecological status and presence of moderate pollution. The structure and assemblage pattern of macrobenthic invertebrates along with the water quality status provide information about the ecological stability of the stream ecosystem. These aspects also give important clues to the functional status of the Himalayan stream ecosystem depicting an apparent gradient in the stream substratum, habitat, and water quality. The prevalence of aquatic insects reflects the diversity in the form and habitat, presence of functional feeding groups, strong dispersal capability, and colonization of microhabitats in the streams. The overall study focuses on the ecological importance of macrobenthic invertebrates along with the health status of fluvial ecosystem.

J	Titus, JH; Titus, PJ; del Moral, R				Titus, JH; Titus, PJ; del Moral, R			Wetland development in primary and secondary successional substrates fourteen years after the eruption of Mount St. Helens, Washington, USA	NORTHWEST SCIENCE												The eruption of Mount St. Helens deposited new substrates upon which wetlands are now developing. Furthermore, the blast damaged vegetation in wetlands surrounding the deposition area. This study describes wetlands in the blast zone north of the crater as documented 14 years after the 1980 eruption with 220 100 m(2) plots. Five wetland types were recognized in the field: moist areas, wet areas with shallow standing water, seasonal streams, permanent streams, and ponds or lakes. The variables, elevation, slope and aspect were determined; hot water springs were discriminated from cold water springs by a nominal variable, and substrate was characterized as stable or unstable. Four levels of disturbance intensity were recognized. Spatial variables, i.e., the position of wetlands on the landscape, were also used in analysis of the data. Using TWINSPAN, we organized the vegetation into 24 wetland plant communities. Based on canonical correspondence analysis, we determined that the measured environmental and spatial variables were unimportant in structuring primary successional vegetation. The lack of a relationship between the wetland types and environmental factors in the primary successional wetland communities suggests that stochastic events, such as seed dispersal, have played a leading role in early primary succession. Vegetation within secondary successional wetlands appears to be more closely related to the wetland types and environmental variables. Thus we conclude that environmental factors were more important in structuring wetland vegetation in areas that were less impacted by the eruption than in those areas where wetlands were newly created.																			0029-344X	2161-9859				AUG	1999	73	3					186	204																WOS:000082500200004

The Western lands, open for America's future, held the promise of what America could become. In Summer on the Lakes, Fuller sketches what she hopes America will become. Using the landscape aesthetics of her age, such as the work of Andrew Jackson Downing and the Hudson River School of landscape painting, Fuller describes the ideal landscape as one that is more feminine and nurturing, one in which humankind lives in harmony with nature. Fuller's landscape descriptions both point to a better future for America and critique the values of her contemporaries. Fuller contrasts America's more male vision of conquest of the land with her feminine ideal of harmony with nature-a cultivated garden-to show what America's future should be, as it builds westward.

The delta(18)O ranged from approximately -30 to -5parts per thousand in precipitation and from -25 to -5parts per thousand in lake water were observed from April to August, 2000. Temporal changes in delta(18)O of precipitation observed weekly at 12 sites all showed the same trend. The temporal variation of delta(18)O in lakes classified into two groups: isotopically steady-state lakes with less than 5parts per thousand variation, and non-steady-state lakes with variation exceeding 10parts per thousand. In non-steady-state lakes, the water originated from snowmelt, and the delta(18)O of lake water gradually enriched as a result of evaporation during the summer. In steady-state lakes, the water originated predominantly from O-18-enriched lake water that had evaporated in the previous summer. The temporal volumetric and isotopic variations in alas lakes are accurately depicted by an isotope mass-balance model using Rayleigh fractionation over daily time steps. The inflow of soil water (subsurface flow) was estimated to be constant (200 m(3)/day) from May to August, based on the difference between observed and simulated lake volumes. Taking the isotopic mass-balance into consideration, the soil water in lower part of the active layer is inferred as a major component of inflow which has a delta(18)O of about -23parts per thousand.

Changing groundwater discharge dynamics in permafrost regions	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Permafrost thaw due to climate warming modifies hydrological processes by increasing hydrological connectivity between aquifers and surface water bodies and increasing groundwater storage. While previous studies have documented arctic river baseflow increases and changing wetland and lake distributions, the hydrogeological processes leading to these changes remain poorly understood. This study uses a coupled heat and groundwater flow numerical model with dynamic freezing and thawing processes and an improved set of boundary conditions to simulate the impacts of climate warming on permafrost distribution and groundwater discharge to surface water bodies. We show a spatial shift in groundwater discharge from upslope to downslope and a temporal shift with increasing groundwater discharge during the winter season due to the formation of a lateral supra-permafrost talik underlying the active layer. These insights into changing patterns of groundwater discharge help explain observed changes in arctic baseflow and wetland patterns and are important for northern water resources and ecosystem management.					; Zipper, Sam/B-8667-2013; Lamontagne-Halle, Pierrick/AAD-8384-2019	McKenzie, Jeffrey/0000-0002-0469-6469; Lamontagne-Halle, Pierrick/0000-0001-7831-7145; Zipper, Sam/0000-0002-8735-5757; Kurylyk, Barret/0000-0002-8244-3838													1748-9326					AUG	2018	13	8							084017	10.1088/1748-9326/aad404	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/aad404													WOS:000440756400001

Samples from densely populated areas, Halifax and the industrialized Miramachi estuary, showed relatively high concentrations of musk ketone (4-acetyl-1-tert-butyl-3,5-dimetyl-2,6-dinitrobenzene MK; maximum levels. mussels 2,200 ng/g lipid; winter Bounder muscle 2,700 ng/g lipid, clams 17,700 ng/g lipid) and HHCB (1,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydro-4,6,6,7,8,8-hexamethylcyclopenta[g]-2-benzopyrane, 'galaxolide'; mussels 1,700 ng/g lipid; winter flounder 40 ng/g lipid; clams 3,000 ng/g lipid), while the samples from sparsely populated areas like Cap-Pele exhibited lower levels (MK maximum levels 130 ng/g lipid; HHCB maximum levels 16 ng/g lipid). Most samples contained relatively low concentrations of musk xylene (1-tert-butyl-3,5-dimetyl-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene, MX) and AHTN (7-acetyl-1,1,3,4,4,6-hexamethyl-tetrahydro-naphthalene, 'tonalide'). In contrast, in Western Europe, concentrations of the polycyclic musks HHCB and AHTN in fish presently exceed those of the nitro musks by about one to three orders of magnitude. These data seem to reflect the different application modes in Western Europe and North America with regard to the prevailing musk components in fragrances. Synthetic musks were not detectable in most commercial fish oils used in the preparation of aquaculture feed and fish lipids extracted in the 1980's in the laboratory, with the exception of a pollock (Pollachius virens) lipid from the Halifax area, which contained MX and MK at 350 and 64 ng/g lipid, respectively.

Occurrence of Penicillium verrucosum, ochratoxin A, ochratoxin B and citrinin in on-farm stored winter wheat from the Canadian Great Lakes Region	PLOS ONE												The occurrence of P. verrucosum and ochratoxin A (OTA) were surveyed for 3 and 4 years, respectively. A total of 250 samples was collected from an average of 30 farms during the 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 winter seasons. Most storage bins surveyed were typically 11 m high round bins made of corrugated, galvanized steel, with flat-bottoms and conical roofs. Samples of clumped grain contained the most P. verrucosum (p<0.05, n = 10) followed by samples taken from the first load (n = 24, mean = 147 +/- 87 CFU/g) and last load (n = 17, mean = 101 +/- 77 CFU/g). Five grain samples (2.2%) tested positive for OTA, citrinin and OTB at concentrations of 14.7 +/- 7.9, 4.9 +/- 1.9 and 1.2 +/- 0.7 ng/g, with only three samples exceeding 5 ng/g. Grain samples positive for OTA were related to moisture resulting from either condensation or migrating moist warm air in the bin or areas where precipitation including snow entered the bin. Bins containing grain and clumps contaminated with OTA were studied in detail. A number of statistically-significant risk factors for OTA contamination were identified. These included 1) grain clumps accumulated around or directly under manhole openings, 2) debris and residue of old grain or grain clumps collected from the bin walls or left on storage floor and augers and 3) grain clumps accumulated around side doors. Even when grain enters storage below the 14.5% threshold of moisture, condensation and moisture migration occurs in hotspots in modern corrugated steel storage bins. Hot spots of OTA contamination were most often in areas affected by moisture migration due to inadequate aeration and exposure to moisture from precipitation or condensation.

Seston was characterized by carbon and nitrogen elemental and isotopic abundances. Fluorescence, temperature, light transmittance, and concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen were also determined. PCBs were analyzed from surface (10 m) seston and Sigma PCB was calculated by summing all of the congeners quantified in each sample. The vertical and seasonal trends in the delta(13)C values of seston exhibited a broad range from -30.7 to -23.9 parts per thousand. Low delta(13)C values that occur concurrently with a peak in fluorescence below the thermocline reflect uptake of C-13 depleted respiratory CO2 and/or the accumulation of C-13 depleted lipids by phytoplankton. High delta(13)C values late in the season likely result from a reduction in photosynthetic fractionation associated with a decrease in the CO2 pool. Seasonal delta(15)N values of seston were high in the spring and declined through August. The delta(15)N values of seston reflect a balance between fractionation during assimilation of NH4+ or NO3- and degradative processes. The seston Sigma PCB and fluorescence were both high in the spring and subsequently declined, suggesting that the concentrations of PCBs in seston were associated with labile material derived from primary productivity. The strong seasonal trends in the organic geochemical characteristics of seston and concentrations of PCBs emphasize the complex nature of particle cycling in aquatic environments.

During summer stratification populations of Spirostomum spp, Loxodes spp., Plagiopyla and Deltopylum become established in the plankton on or below the oxycline/thermocline. At shallow sites no migration occurred and populations of the migratory species in the benthos were sparse, with the exception of Plagiopyla which occurred in high densities in the sediment.

Both of these events occurred in August and were only 2 years apart. Data show that the period of deepest mixing and lake turnover also occurs during late summer in this region of tropical Africa. In addition, recent trends of decreases in both air temperatures and effective insolation relative to long-term means suggest that weakening of stratification, coupled with a predictable seasonal interval of reduced stability in August, may be responsible for the timing of these events.

Here we report ann-alkane and compound-specific carbon isotope record from the Holocene sediments of Lake Yiheshariwusu in the middle of the Hulun Buir sandy land. The sediments contain a suite ofn-alkanes with a strong odd over even carbon number predominance, with the maximum contribution fromnC(31), which is a typical distribution in grassland regions. The low temperatures in this cold region greatly limit the growth of C4 plants and thus the long-chainn-alkanes in lake sediments are mainly derived from leaf wax lipids of C3 plants growing within the sandy land. In this C3-vegetation-dominated region, the delta(13)C(27-33)value (weighted carbon isotope values ofnC(27)-nC(33)) are regulated mainly by the physiological and biochemical responses of plants to water stress and are therefore interpreted as a proxy of effective precipitation or humidity. The delta(13)C(27-33)time series shows a trend of gradually decreasing values that suggests an increase in effective precipitation since 8.5 ka (1 ka = 1000 cal yr BP). Relative droughts occurred during the intervals of 6.3-5.5, 4.1-3.6 ka, and during the last 200 years. In addition, the delta(13)C(27-33)time series and comparable paleoenvironmental records from neighboring sites suggest opposite trends of summer monsoon rainfall between northeastern and southeastern China. We suggest that a coupled process between low and high latitudes (the western Pacific Subtropical High and the Okhotsk High) may have played a fundamental role in regulating the shift of the frontal rainfall belt and monsoon rainfall distribution in eastern China during the Holocene.

Analysis of hydrochemical and hydrological data for 2010-2017 showed that talik groundwater feeds lake and maintains perennial outflow from the lake. Variations in the chemical composition of the lake and outflowing creek are characterized on an annual and interannual basis. Seasonal comparison of hydrochemical data indicates a downward trend in dissolved-solids content of the lake water over the last six years, suggesting an increasing contribution of suprapermafrost groundwater to the lake and lake talik. Probable reason of enhanced suprapermafrost flow is increase of its duration due to observed rise of winter air temperature.

Remote sensing is a valuable tool to assess and map crop residue cover and cover crops. The objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of linear spectral unmixing for estimating soil cover in the non-growing season (November-May) over the Canadian Lake Erie Basin using seasonal multitemporal satellite imagery. Soil cover ground measurements and multispectral Landsat-8 imagery were acquired for two areas throughout the 2015-2016 non-growing season. Vertical soil cover photos were collected from up to 40 residue and 30 cover crop fields for each area (e.g., Elgin and Essex sites) when harvest, cloud, and snow conditions permitted. Images and data were reviewed and compiled to represent a complete coverage of the basin for three time periods (post-harvest, pre-planting, and post-planting). The correlations between field measured and satellite imagery estimated soil covers (e.g., residue and green) were evaluated by coefficient of determination (R-2) and root mean square error (RMSE). Overall, spectral unmixing of satellite imagery is well suited for estimating soil cover in the non-growing season. Spectral unmixing using three-endmembers (i.e., corn residue-soil-green cover; soybean residue-soil-green cover) showed higher correlations with field measured soil cover than spectral unmixing using two- or four-endmembers. For the nine non-growing season images analyzed, the residue and green cover fractions derived from linear spectral unmixing using corn residue-soil-green cover endmembers were highly correlated with the field-measured data (mean R-2 of 0.70 and 0.86, respectively). The results of this study support the use of remote sensing and spectral unmixing techniques for monitoring performance metrics for government initiatives, such as the Canada-Ontario Lake Erie Action Plan, and as input for sustainability indicators that both require knowledge about non-growing season land management over a large area.					; Berg, Aaron/AAU-3547-2021	Berg, Aaron/0000-0001-8438-5662; McNairn, Heather/0000-0003-1006-0018; Joosse, Pamela/0000-0002-1532-7175; 														2072-4292				MAY	2020	12	9							1397	10.3390/rs12091397	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12091397													WOS:000543394000044

Understanding how these threats affect the behaviour of biomonitoring indices is essential in order to provide reliable tools for the management and conservation of watercourses. To this purpose we tested the relationship of the STAR_ICMi index and its metrics, LIFE index and macroinvertebrate community with hydrology, water chemistry and land use in 8 sites located along the Oglio River course (Northern Italy), a watercourse originating from a large and deep lake. Macroinvertebrates and water samples were collected seasonally from summer 2013 to summer 2015 and daily discharge data were used to calculate several indices of hydrological alteration. A subset of these variables was selected by principal component analysis for using in the data analysis. The influence of hydrology, water chemistry and land use on macroinvertebrate community structure was explored with the variance partitioning method, while their influence on biomonitoring indices was analysed in a linear mixed effect model framework. Temporal and spatial constraints were explicitly considered in both analyses. Macroinvertebrate community structure was mainly related to these last two factors and to their joint effects with water chemistry and hydrology. STAR_ICMi, its metrics (with the exception of the Shannon index) and LIFE were related to the distance from the lake outlet, a proxy of mean annual discharge, groundwater input and artificial land use. STAR_ICMi, ASPT and EPT richness were also inversely related to the flow variability in the 3 months preceding sample collection. Surprisingly LIFE index was not related to any of the hydrological variables. The results of this study highlight weakness in the current biomonitoring tools and support the need for further investigations on macroinvertebrate interrelations with environmental drivers and their spatial and temporal structure. This is essential to overcome the limitations that may affect the reliability of macroinvertebrate-based indices in aquatic biomonitoring.

Late Pleistocene-Holocene vegetation and Indian summer monsoon record from the Lahaul, Northwest Himalaya, India	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The high resolution Holocene paleomonsoon records from Northwest (NW) Himalaya are limited. The carbon isotope (delta C-13), Total organic carbon (TOC) and pollen analysis were therefore carried out from a peat-lake sediment sequence developed in alpine meadows of the Chandra valley, Lahaul, NW Himalaya, in order to reconstruct centennial to millennial scale vegetational changes and Indian summer monsoon (ISM) variability during the Holocene. The chronology of peat-lake sediments is constrained with 9 AMS C-14 dates. The recovered non-arboreal pollen (NAP) suggested that during Holocene alpine desert-steppe, meadows and shrubs growing along the stream had developed in the Lahaul valley whereas arboreal pollens (AP) e.g. Pinus, Quercus, Cedrus and Ulmus presently growing in the southern hill slopes of Pir Panjal range indicated moisture carrying monsoonal air flow from the South. The increased delta C-13 and low TOC values between similar to 12,880 and 11,640 calibrated years before present (cal yr BP) suggested weakening of ISM and low organic carbon production corresponding to the Younger Dryas (YD) cold event. The gradual depletion in carbon isotope ratio from similar to 11,640 to 8810 cal yr BP indicated enhanced precipitation in the Chandra valley in response of increased ISM strength in early Holocene. The short spell of cold and dry climate with gradual decrease in ISM intensity between ca 10,398 and 9778 cal yr BP is closely linked with Bond event-7. The other prominent cold-dry events recorded in present study are (i) similar to 8810 to 8117 cal yr BP roughly corresponding to global 8.2 ka cold event, (ii) similar to 4808 to 4327 cal yr BP closely preceding the global 4.2 ka cold-arid period, and (iii) similar to 1303 to 1609 cal AD corresponding to Little Ice Age (LIA) event. The expansion of thermophillous broad leaved taxa viz. Betula utilis, Alnus nepalensis, Quercus semicaipifolia and Juglans regia and effective growth of meadow vegetation such as grasses, Caryophyllaceae and Artemisia along with marshy elements i.e. Polygonum and Liliaceae between similar to 6732 and 3337 cal yr BP marked warm and wet Holocene climate optimum (HCO) period. The warm and moist climate from similar to 1158-647 cal yr BP corresponded with global Medieval Warm Period (MWP). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

A one-dimensional model for phytoflagellate distribution in the meromictic lake	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Using mathematical modeling methods, the work investigates possible existence of a phytoflagellate population in the ecosystem of a stratified lake (Lake Shira, Khakasia, Russia). Until this study was carried out, no phytoflagellate population had been detected in the lake, although there had been indirect evidence of the possible presence of a cryptomonad population in this water body. To answer the question if this population may be present in this water body, as the first step of investigation, a mathematical model was developed describing the microorganism biomass dynamics and phytoflagellate relationship with the lake food web. The calculations showed that cryptophytic algae were abundant in the water column layers above the lake chemocline at the beginning of summer but showed low biomass concentrations during other periods of time. In the summer following the construction of the model, samples were collected from Lake Shira, as the next step of the study. A cryptophytic algae population was found in the water column, and the pattern of its distribution in the ecosystem was similar to that predicted by the model. In addition to that, we studied theoretically possible reasons for the early summer development of the population in the deep water layers and found that it was the result of the mixotrophic feeding strategy of cryptomonads and trophic interactions in the food web. The study shows that preliminary modeling of the locational and temporal distribution of populations whose presence in the ecosystem is only suggested by indirect evidence may be useful as a tool for searching for the species in natural ecosystems and as an approach enabling a more accurate description of the food web structure of a water body.

During the day, ducks spent 28% of the time feeding, 57% resting 11% in locomotion, 4% preening and 1% in alert behaviour.. No courtship behaviour tons observed. Resting peaked in the middle of the day. As wave-height increased, feeding and swimming increased and resting decreased, Ar night, 92% of time was spent feeding. Sites used by White-headed Ducks held a higher biomass of food it ems (benthic chironomid larvae) than other parts of the lake. Movement of individuals and marked differences in diurnal time budgets occurred between sites, as birds concentrated in flocks for resting and dispersed to feed. The proportion of birds resting increased with the number of birds present, both within and between sites. Feeding tons concentrated at those sites supporting a higher biomass of chironomids for a given depth.

We applied virtual population analysis (VPA) in estimating year-class strength. A good correlation was found between YOY density and YCS of peled. In contrast, the density of YOY whitefish (C. lavaretus) did not reliably reflect their YCS. Annual number of trawling tows in 1991-2001 averaged 23 per reservoir. Precision (SE (x) over bar (-1)) of the annual replicate samples averaged 0.33 and 0.31 for peled and whitefish, respectively. This level of precision was sufficient for detecting the large, often order-of-magnitude differences between annual mean YOY densities. As a practical application in fisheries management, YOY densities in survey trawling can be used in adjusting of stocking density and fishery of peled in the reservoirs studied.																			0003-455X					FEB 26	2004	41	1					255	262																WOS:000220364300029

Long-term reconstruction of deep-water oxygen conditions in Osoyoos Lake (British Columbia, Canada): implications for Okanagan River sockeye salmon	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Simmatis B, Jeziorski A, Zemanek A, Selbie DT, Hyatt K, Fryer JK, Cumming BF, Smol JP. 2018. Long-term reconstruction of deep-water oxygen conditions in Osoyoos Lake: implications for Okanagan River sockeye salmon. Lake Reserve Manage. 34:392-400.Osoyoos Lake is the primary nursery lake supporting sockeye salmon (Onchorhynchus nerka) originating from the Okanagan River system in south-central British Columbia, Canada. By the early 1960s, Osoyoos Lake had experienced significant cultural eutrophication related to rapid human development of the watershed, increasing total phosphorus concentrations, and frequent algal blooms. Concern exists regarding recent (post-1990s) declines in hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations and the potential degradation of salmon habitat in this multi-basin lake. However, reliable observations are largely unavailable for oxygen conditions prior to the mid-1990s. We reconstructed late-summer volume-weighted hypolimnetic oxygen (VWHO) concentrations in Osoyoos Lake from the late 1800s to 2009 by examining past chironomid (Diptera: Chironomidae) subfossil assemblages from Pb-210-dated lake sediment cores. Chironomid-inferred VWHO revealed only slight variations since the late 1800s (mean values for the north and south basins are 4.4 and 2.9mg/L, respectively), with seemingly little response to the cultural eutrophication of the mid-20th century. The chironomid-inferred VWHO trends suggest that the current management target of 5.8mg/L dissolved oxygen for both basins of Osoyoos Lake may require revision to better reflect reference conditions and natural seasonal anoxia.

Evaporation apparently increased the F and salt concentrations to levels at which the common method of F analyses became unreliable, even after dilution. It is recommended to re-examine the very high F levels reported in the saline lakes of Rift Valley. The F levels of Tilapia grahami living in water with about 110 mg F l-1 averaged (mg F kg-1 dry weight): fillet 68, skin 819, gills 1,366 and bones 1,661. The variation was highest in fillet and skin. There was no positive correlation between tissue F levels and fish size (range 3-20 g). It remains uncertain whether the fish bone was saturated at this concentration of F or if some mechanism of elimination hindered higher F accumulation in the skeletal structures.

In this study, we established delta N-15 timeseries in organic matter and delta C-13 timeseries in ostracod shells from sediments of Lake Lugu and attributed their variations to decadal/multi-decadal temperature variations. We compared temperature variations along the ETP transect during the past four centuries based on our presently developed and previously developed temperature proxy indices, as well as temperature variations reconstructed by other researchers. We found that: (1) Over the north ETP area (N-ETP), the decadal/multi-decadal variations in temperature correlate well with each other. (2) Over the south ETP area (S-ETP), temperature variations correlate not so well with each other; while those at south to west portion of the Tibetan Plateau are rather local. (3) The decadal variations in temperature are generally synchronous with those in precipitation over the N-ETP area, and they are broadly antiphase/out-of-phase with the corresponding ones over the S-ETP area. (4) The long term temperature and precipitation trends are coupling over the N-ETP but decoupling over the S-ETP. We speculate that because the N-ETP is located at the frontier of the Asian summer monsoon (ASM) region, temperature variations there are not as strongly influenced by the ASM; they are most likely dominated by changes in solar activities, and show general similarity to the average of the Northern Hemisphere. Over the S-ETP area, decadal temperature variations are obviously influenced by precipitation. Because the decadal/ multi-decadal precipitation variations are anti-phase and/or out-of-phase between the N-ETP and SETP, the decadal/multi-decadal temperature variations between these two regions are also anti-phase and/or out-of-phase.

J	Tsydenov, BO				Tsydenov, Bair O.			Simulating phytoplankton growth during the spring thermal bar in a deep lake	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												Phytoplankton growth in Lake Baikal was simulated during thermal bar events using meteorological data from June 1-30, 2017. Dynamics of the thermal bar and the plankton population were reproduced by the coupled physical-biological model that describes hydrodynamic processes and interactions of the components of the nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton-detritus system. The key point of the model is consideration of atmospheric impact on the lake surface, taking into account the intraday variability of wind forcing and fluxes of shortwave and longwave radiation and latent and sensible heat. Numerical modeling showed that a combination of cabbeling instability, associated with the thermal bar, and wind-driven currents lead to sinking of the phytoplankton biomass from the surface area to the lower layers of the lake. The increase in phytoplankton results in a degradation of the nutrients in the corresponding water environment. Simulations demonstrated that the maximum concentrations of phytoplankton are localized in the inshore side of the thermal bar. At the same time, the thermal bar acted as a barrier preventing the horizontal propagation of the biological substances into open waters. A comparative analysis of the calculated temperature and phytoplankton distributions with available field data was performed.

Modeling salinization and recovery of road salt-impacted lakes in temperate regions based on long-term monitoring of Lake George, New York (USA) and its drainage basin	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Road salt mitigates winter highway icing but accumulates in watershed soils and receiving waters, affecting soil chemistry and physical, biological, and ecological processes. Despite efforts to reduce salt loading in watersheds, accumulated cations and Cl- continue to impact tributaries and lakes, and the recovery process is notwell understood. Lake George, New York (USA) is typical of many temperate lakes at risk for elevated Cl- concentrations from winter deicing; the lake salt concentration increased by similar to 3.4% year(-1) since 1980. Here, we evaluated the ionic composition in Finkle Brook, a major watershed draining to Lake George, studied intermittently since 1970 and typical of other salt-impacted Lake George tributaries. Salt loading in the Lake George basin since the 1940s displaced cations from exchange sites in basin soils; these desorbed cations follow a simple ion-exchange model, with lower sodium and higher calcium, magnesium and potassium fluxes in runoff. Reduced salt application in the Finkle Brook watershed during the low-snow winter of 2015-2016 led to a 30-40% decline of Cl- and base cations in the tributary, implying a Cl- soil half-life of 1-2 years. We developed a conceptual model that describes cation behavior in runoff from a watershed that received road salt loading over a long period of time, and then recovery following reduced salt loading. Next, we developed a dynamic model estimating time to steady-state for Cl- in Lake George with road salt loading starting in 1940, calibrating the model with tributary runoff and lake chemistry data from 1970 and 1980, respectively, and forecasting Cl(-)concentrations in Lake George based on various scenarios of salt loading and soil retention of Cl-. Our Lake George models are readily adaptable to other temperate lakes with drainage basins where road salt is applied during freezing conditions and paved roads cover a portion of the watershed.

J	Dolman, AM; Mischke, U; Wiedner, C				Dolman, Andrew M.; Mischke, Ute; Wiedner, Claudia			Lake-type-specific seasonal patterns of nutrient limitation in German lakes, with target nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations for good ecological status	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Eutrophication is a global environmental problem that leaves many lakes with impaired ecological status. Human activity has increased the total concentrations of both nitrogen and phosphorus in aquatic systems, but their relative influence on phytoplankton biomass is uncertain. Their action as alternative limiting resources complicates assessment of their relative influence and disagreement may be in part due to seasonal shifts and lake-type-specific differences in the prevalence of limitation by nitrogen versus phosphorus. Debate continues as to whether measures to reduce nitrogen would be beneficial in addition to controls placed on phosphorus. 2. We used a piecewise model to test whether total nitrogen (TN) concentrations, in addition to total phosphorus (TP), influence phytoplankton biomass in 369 lowland German lakes. The piecewise model predicts biomass from TN for low N : P ratio lakes, and from TP for high N : P ratio lakes. We tested three N : P mass ratios to divide lakes: dissolved inorganic nitrogen to TP (DIN : TP), DIN to dissolved reactive phosphorus (DIN : DIP) and TN : TP. TN was a better predictor of biomass than TP when either the DIN : TP ratio was below 1.6, DIN : DIP was below 8.4, or TN : TP below 29; predictions were most accurate when using the DIN : TP ratio. 3. To investigate seasonal and lake-type-specific patterns of N and P limitation, we used the DIN : TP ratio, together with absolute concentrations of DIN and DIP, to predict the limiting nutrient at each lake in each month of the vegetation period. N limitation was much more common in polymictic than stratified lakes. While a high proportion of both stratified and polymictic lakes were P limited in early spring (60-70%), for polymictic lakes, we found a strong shift from P limitation to N limitation in summer: more than 50% of polymictic lakes were N limited between June and September and only 15-30% were P limited. 4. To obtain lake-type-specific nutrient targets we estimated the average TN and TP concentrations at which lakes of different types achieved good ecological status according to EU water framework directive criteria. Stratified lakes achieved good ecological status at concentrations of 400-500 mu g L-1 TN or 20-35 mu g L-1 TP, while for polymictic lakes values of 500-1000 mu g L-1 TN, or 35-75 mu g L-1 TP were required. 5. We estimate that nitrogen has an important influence on phytoplankton biovolume, and thus ecological status, for many polymictic lakes in Germany. While there is some uncertainty in the nutrient targets required to achieve good ecological status, this uncertainty is small compared with the range of concentrations currently observed, and lakes with moderate or worse status have concentrations of both TN and TP that are far above these current target estimates.

Densities and spatial distributions of 3 snail species including P antipodarum and the threatened Taylorconcha serpenticola were compared am ng 3 adjacent habitat types (run, edge, and vegetation) in Banbury Springs, a tributary of the Snake River, near Hagerman, Idaho. USA. In all 3 habitats P. antipodarum was the most abundant snail species. All 3 species densities were highly variable within habitats, suggesting a nonrandom distribution pattern. Densities of P. antipodarum were significantly greatest in the vegetation habitat type, while densities of T. serpenticola were similar among habitats. Smaller-sized P. antipodarum were less abundant in the run habitat with its associated higher water velocities. and their densities were negatively correlated with velocity. Densities of P. antipodarum also were negatively correlated with distance from the highly infested, man-made Morgan Lake. while T serpenticola densities were positively correlated with distance from Morgan Lake. Potamopyrgus antipodarum is a potential competitor with native aquatic species. although its colonization into some freshwater habitats may be limited.																			1527-0904					JUL	2001	61	3					375	380																WOS:000170391700013

As a result, environmental conditions right at the moment of deglaciation of the large N-Hemisphere ice-sheets remain largely unknown. Here we study three deglacial phases of the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet as a unique, repeated element in a long sediment record preserved at Soldl in northern Finland. We summarize extensive multi-proxy data (diatoms, phytoliths, chironomids, pollen, spores, non-pollen palynomorphs, macrofossils, lithology, loss-on-ignition, C/N) obtained on glacial lake sediments dated to the early Holocene (ca. 10 kyr BP), early MIS 3 (ca. 50 kyr BP) and early MIS 5a (ca. 80 kyr BP). In contrast to the common view of an unproductive ice-marginal environment, our study reconstructs rich ecosystems both in the glacial lake and along the shores with forest on recently deglaciated land. Higher than present-day summer temperatures are reconstructed based on a large variety of aquatic taxa. Rich biota developed due to the insolation-induced postglacial warming and high nutrient levels, the latter resulting from erosion of fresh bedrock and sediment, leaching of surface soils, decay of plant material under shallow water conditions, and sudden decreases in lake volume. Aquatic communities responded quickly to deglaciation and warm summers and reflect boreal conditions, in contrast to the terrestrial ecosystem which responded with some delay probably due to time required for slow soil formation processes. Birch forest is reconstructed upon deglaciation of the large LGM ice-sheet and shrub tundra following the probably faster melting smaller MIS 4 and MIS 5b ice-sheets. Our study shows that glacial lake sediments can provide valuable palaeo-environmental data, that aquatic biota and terrestrial vegetation rapidly accommodated to new environmental conditions during deglaciation, and that glacial lake ecosystems, and the carbon stored in their sediments, should be included in earth system modeling.					; Luoto, Miska/E-6693-2014; Weckstrom, Jan/N-7665-2013; Weckström, Jan/N-7665-2013	Salonen, Sakari/0000-0002-8847-9081; Weckstrom, Jan/0000-0001-5604-617X; Katrantsiotis, Christos/0000-0003-4881-2481; Luoto, Miska/0000-0001-6203-5143; Luoto, Tomi/0000-0001-6925-3688													0921-8181	1872-6364				AUG	2018	167						61	73		10.1016/j.gloplacha.2018.05.004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2018.05.004													WOS:000438322900005
J	Urrutia-Cordero, P; Ekvall, MK; Hansson, LA				Urrutia-Cordero, Pablo; Ekvall, Mattias K.; Hansson, Lars-Anders			Responses of cyanobacteria to herbivorous zooplankton across predator regimes: who mows the bloom?	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The massive growth of large, toxic cyanobacteria in eutrophic waters has traditionally been explained by their evolution of defences to herbivorous zooplankton. These conclusions come mostly from studies using the large-bodied cladoceran Daphnia as a grazer model. In contrast, very little is known about the effects of other zooplankters such as copepods and small cladocerans that, unlike Daphnia, often coexist with cyanobacterial blooms and under high levels of fish predation. We performed a series of grazing experiments during a cyanobacterial bloom in a eutrophic lake, subject to decreasing predation on zooplankton (removal of cyprinid fish). We also used long-term observational data to analyse the response of cyanobacteria to changes in abundance, body size and biomass of the naturally, coexisting zooplankton community across different predator regimes. A natural grazer community, dominated by selective herbivores like calanoid and cyclopoid copepods, positively affected cyanobacterial growth in early summer at low cyanobacterial densities. However, cyclopoid copepods and small cladocerans suppressed the growth of Anabaena, Microcystis and Planktothrix species under bloom conditions in late summer, with the exception of the highly toxic Microcystis botrys. Long-term observational data support the results from the grazing experiments regarding the potential capacity of the natural zooplankton community to suppress cyanobacterial growth, especially of the dominant taxon Microcystis (including the most toxic species, M.botrys). In particular, these results suggest that direct grazing may contribute significantly to the observed 72% decrease in Microcystis biomass through a 111% increase in abundance of cyclopoid copepods, and an 18% increase in body size of cyclopoid copepods and a 31% increase in body size of the generalist feeder Daphnia, during the biomanipulation. Together, these results suggest that, within the complex interactions brought about by trophic cascades, direct grazing by the coexisting zooplankton community is a strong driver regulating cyanobacterial growth in eutrophic lakes and that this can display contrasting effects, both seasonally and under different levels of fish predation. Importantly, we show that herbivory may be enhanced along a gradient of decreasing fish predation by the combined action of copepods (selective herbivores) and Daphnia (generalist herbivores).					; Hansson, Lars-Anders/HCI-2735-2022	Urrutia Cordero, Pablo/0000-0001-9560-8374; Hansson, Lars-Anders/0000-0002-3035-1317; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				MAY	2015	60	5					960	972		10.1111/fwb.12555	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12555													WOS:000352571600010

The reason is a low availability of sites with sediments harbouring fossil remains. In the Povasky Inovec Mts, two small protected calcareous wetlands occur in different geographical position and contain suitable sediments. One represents a foothill site (initiated ca 13,000 cal. BP) whereas the other a low-mountain site (initiated ca 7,400 cal. BP). We investigated fossil pollen, spores, and macroscopic remains of plants and molluscs from their sediments. We further reviewed archaeological data, constructed a macrophysical climate model (MCM) and confronted it with other palaeoclimatic proxies. Temperate deciduous trees (Quercus, Corylus and Ulmus) occurred since the AllerOd, but their expansion was blocked by a harsh climate in Younger Dryas, when Larix, Pinus and Betula nana still occurred. The climate firstly moistened at ca 9,500 cal. BP and more distinctly at ca 8,500 cal. BP, which was reflected by a strong calcium carbonate precipitation and expansion of Tilia cordata t., Hedera helix, and Ustulina. Although the MCM predicted a rather stable climate since 8,000 cal. BP, certain changes in aquatic mollusc abundances may indicate hydrological fluctuations, as they are paralleled by changes in climate humidity indicated by other evidence from the Western Carpathians. Younger hydrological fluctuations may be alternatively explained by human activities as they correspond with macro-charcoal abundance and indicators of wetland openness. During their existence, both fens harboured only few fen plant and mollusc species specialized to low-productive sedge-moss fens. In the Middle Holocene both sites were encroached by woody plants (Alnus, Picea and Salix), as most other spring fens in the Western Carpathians. Contrary to some other spring fens with similar site conditions in the Western Carpathians, few fen specialists established in the study sites since deforestation, presumably because of severe disturbances caused by grazing and/or hemp retting instead of the usual mowing.

Climate, Fire, and Vegetation Mediate Mercury Delivery to Midlatitude Lakes over the Holocene	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The rise in mercury concentrations in lake sediment r deposited over the last similar to 150 years is widely recognized to have resulted from human activity. However, few studies in the Great Lakes region have used lake sediment to reconstruct atmospheric mercury deposition on millennial time scales. Here we present a 9000-year mercury record from sediment in Copper Falls; a small closed-basin lake on the Keweenaw Peninsula. Prior to abrupt increases in the 19th and 20th centuries, mercury remains at relatively low concentrations for the last 9000 years. Higher mercury fluxes in the early Holocene (3.4 +/- 1.1 mu g m(-2) yr(-1)) are attributed to drier conditions and greater forest fire occurrence. The gradual decline in mercury flux over the middle to late Holocene (1.9 +/- 0.2 mu g m(-)(2) yr(-1)) is interpreted to reflect a transition to wetter conditions, which reduced forest fires, and promoted the development of soil organic matter and deciduous forests that sequestered natural sources of mercury. The Copper Falls Lake record highlights the sensitivity of watersheds to changes in mercury inputs from both human and natural forcings, and provides millennial-scale context for recent mercury contamination that will aid in establishing baseline values for restoration efforts.					; Cooke, Colin/E-7842-2011	Pompeani, David/0000-0002-3571-4586; Cooke, Colin/0000-0002-7417-5263													0013-936X	1520-5851				AUG 7	2018	52	15					8157	8164		10.1021/acs.est.8b01523	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.8b01523								29949357					WOS:000441477600013
J	Law, T; Zhang, WT; Zhao, JY; Arhonditsis, GB				Law, Tony; Zhang, Weitao; Zhao, Jingyang; Arhonditsis, George B.			Structural changes in lake functioning induced from nutrient loading and climate variability	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Climate variability is increasingly recognized as an important regulatory factor, capable of influencing the structural properties of aquatic ecosystems. Lakes appear to be particularly sensitive to the ecological impacts of climate variability, and several long time series have shown a close coupling between climate, lake thermal properties and individual organism physiology, population abundance, community structure, and food web dynamics. Thus, understanding the complex interplay among meteorological forcing, hydrological variability, and ecosystem functioning is essential for improving the credibility of model-based water resources/fisheries management. Our objective herein is to examine the relative importance of the ecological mechanisms underlying plankton seasonal variability in Lake Washington, Washington State (USA), over a 35-year period (1964-1998). Our analysis is founded upon an intermediate complexity plankton model that is used to reproduce the limiting nutrient (phosphate)-phytoplankton-zooplankton-detritus (particulate phosphorus) dynamics in the lake. Model parameterization is based on a Bayesian calibration scheme that offers insights into the degree of information the data contain about model inputs and allows obtaining predictions along with uncertainty bounds for modeled output variables. The model accurately reproduces the key seasonal planktonic patterns in Lake Washington and provides realistic estimates of predictive uncertainty for water quality variables of environmental management interest. A principal component analysis of the annual estimates of the underlying ecological processes highlighted the significant role of the phosphorus recycling stemming from the zooplankton excretion on the planktonic food web variability. We also identified a moderately significant signature of the local climatic conditions (air temperature) on phytoplankton growth (r= 0.41), herbivorous grazing (r= 0.38), and detritus mineralization (r= 0.39). Our study seeks linkages with the conceptual food web model proposed by Hampton et al. [Hampton, S.E., Scheuerell, M.D., Schindler, D.E., 2006b. Coalescence in the Lake Washington story: interaction strengths in a planktonic food web. Limnol. Oceanogr. 51, 2042-2051.] to emphasize the "bottom-up" control of the Lake Washington plankton phenology. The posterior predictive distributions of the plankton model are also used to assess the exceedance frequency and confidence of compliance with total phosphorus (15 mu g L-1) and chlorophyll a (4 mu g L-1) threshold levels during the summer-stratified period in Lake Washington. Finally, we conclude by underscoring the importance of explicitly acknowledging the uncertainty in ecological forecasts to the management of freshwater ecosystems under a changing global environment.

Although the restrictive effects of high UVR on phytoplankton are generally recognized, the effects will be impacted by the UVR levels of seasonal changes and the nutrient status. In this study, in situ phytoplankton productivity was measured seasonally under full solar radiation and only visible light (photosynthetically active radiation, PAR) conditions in the plateau oligotrophic Lake Fuxian, Southwest China. To determine the single effects of UVR and nutrient enrichment and their combined impact on phytoplankton communities, a mesocosm experiment (1 month) was conducted outdoors during late summer (rainy season). The interactive experiment was designed with two radiation treatments (UVR + PAR and PAR) and four nutrient treatments (raw water, nitrogen addition, phosphorus addition, nitrogen and phosphorus addition). Our results suggested that the response of phytoplankton to UVR depended largely on nutrient availability, which was embodied in the no significant responses of phytoplankton productivity and total biomass to UVR in the oligotrophic raw water from Lake Fuxian, but the positive responses of total biomass to UVR in the nutrient enrichment treatment. Furthermore, the response of phytoplankton to UVR was also taxa dependent. Chlorophytes and dinoflagellates showed positive response to UVR, whereas chrysophytes were quite sensitive to UVR; diatoms had no significant response to UVR under all nutrient conditions, while the response of cyanobacteria to UVR was highly dependent on nutrient status. This study highlights that the increase in nutrient concentrations in oligotrophic lake not only directly promotes the growth of phytoplankton but also combines with low UVR during summer to benefit the growth of eutrophic taxa based on the non-negative effect of UVR on total phytoplankton biomass and the positive effect on eutrophic taxa.

Reimagining Spring Lake Park through LID	LID: IT WORKS IN ALL CLIMATES AND SOILS					International Low Impact Development Conference (LID)	JAN 19-21, 2015	Houston, TX	Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Environm & Water Resource Inst, Urban Water Resources Res Council, Low Impact Dev Tech Comm,				Spring Lake Park is located in South Omaha on the bluffs of the Missouri River. It consists of native upland forest on loess soils surrounding a valley rich with several seeps, wetlands, and waterways with a contributing drainage area of 79 hectares. An antiquated and leaky combined sewer line flows through the center of the park, short-circuiting natural drainage patterns and lowering ground water levels. The forested park, named for a spring-fed lake which has since silted in, has been somewhat neglected and underutilized in past years. As part of sewer separation and park retrofit efforts, seepage water and surface runoff will be retained, filtered and infiltrated through several LID practices located throughout the park. The design aims to reengage the community with the park by utilizing constructed LID practices as multi-functional facilities and reintroducing a 0.8-hectare fishing lake. The restoration of the naturally dynamic drainage system infused energy into the design process and allowed robust design objectives to be achieved. Three design themes emerged: ecological sensitivity, integration, and innovation. The park design sought ecological sensitivity through preserving seep and wetland areas, significantly reducing sediment loads near the source, and including an aggressive planting plan with all native plants. The design integrated passive recreation, education, aesthetics as well as including community input as part of the design process. Finally, the design utilized several innovative practices including several diversion structures, off-line systems, and a zero-discharge basin. The presentation will further describe several design elements that support the three aforementioned design themes.																					978-0-7844-7902-5				2015							372	383																WOS:000381031400038

Our previous studies in large and shallow Lake Peipsi suggested the importance of the redox-related P release in internal P loading. In the current study, we explored the validity of this hypothesis by also considering organic sediment P (Org-P). We analysed spatio-temporal changes in diffusive P flux and sediment P forms determined by P fractionation and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in summer 2021. Using 1997-2021 data, we computed internal P load (IL) by two methods and studied their relationships with several water quality variables. Anoxia of sediment surfaces and P release progressed with an increase in water tem-perature during summer. In the long-term, IL estimates by two methods were similar (mean values: 315 and 346 mg/m2/year) and correlated with the predicted anoxia of sediment surfaces (AApred). A contribution of sediment iron-bound P (Fe-P) to P release was indicated by the positive correlation of Fe-P with orthophosphate (NMR) in the short-term studies. No similar evidence was found for Org-P, which contradicts the common tendency to attribute internal P loads largely to Org-P in eutrophic lakes. Nevertheless, organic matter seemed to support					Toom, Lauri/J-6078-2013; Nurnberg, Gertrud/AFM-9725-2022; Tõnno, Ilmar/G-5043-2016; Nõges, Peeter/AAL-5343-2020														0048-9697	1879-1026				JAN 10	2024	907								168044	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.168044	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.168044		NOV 2023						37898204					WOS:001111652800001

Biological Flora of Britain and Ireland: Liparis loeselii No. 304	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Liparis loeselii (L.) Rich. (Fen Orchid) that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of Britain and Ireland: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, and history and conservation. Liparis loeselii is a small terrestrial orchid that has a circumboreal distribution and is widespread in Europe and North America. Despite its wide distribution, the species is locally rare and has declined considerably in most of its range. In Britain, the species has a disjunct distribution and is now known to occur consistently at only six sites in eastern England and three in south Wales. It is absent from Ireland. Its most characteristic habitats in Britain are inland fens and coastal dune slacks, but outside Britain it can also be found in wet meadows, marshes, forested seep springs, at lake borders or on mats of floating peat. Populations of Liparis loeselii in dune slacks tend to be short-lived, and can rapidly increase in size or decrease and disappear as environmental conditions change. The species does not tolerate high nutrient concentrations or low pH. It is susceptible to drought, which reduces seed germination, seedling recruitment and adult survival. Heavy predation by rabbits and rodents has been observed under drought conditions. Liparis loeselii reproduces both by sexual reproduction, and by vegetative propagation through the production of pseudobulbs. Although flowers are accessible to insects, entomophilous pollination is unusual, and most sexual reproduction is the result of selfing. Fruits ripen late in the growing season (mid-October) and the dust-like seeds are dispersed during winter by wind and water. Germination occurs during the following growing season and is supported by a wide variety of mycorrhizal fungi. Since the late 19th century Liparis loeselii has declined considerably in Britain and elsewhere in Europe, primarily due to habitat destruction and loss, natural succession, and habitat desiccation due to drainage. As a result, the species has been listed as endangered in the Bern Convention and the European Habitat Directive (92/43/EEC) and is the focus of intensive conservation efforts in many countries. Restoration of habitat by mowing, extensive grazing and peat removal, and the creation of new habitat by dune slack formation in dune systems and peat removal in fens may prolong population persistence and promote establishment of new populations.

The present study was conducted at the spot of the confluence of spring water, heavily loaded with toxic metals, which joins the Majdanska River by a few meters short stream. The spring water is outflow of underground water drained by passage through polymetallic mineralisation. The chemical characteristics of the Majdanska River water and the associated periphyton were used to evaluate and explain the abiotic response to the intrusion of toxicants and its impact on biota. At the site of the stream inflow, thorough mixing of Majdanska River water and incoming spring water resulted in an increase of Eh and pH close to the average river value. This geochemical barrier causes significant changes in the mobility of metal species. Moreover, the output composition of water is further modified by biological processes. The examined biota community was found to consist of algae Audouinella sp. and Spirogyra sp., with coexisting freshwater snails Radix labiata, diatoms and bacteria. While the carbonate bedrock controls the pH of the river water by effective buffering, it seems that bioconcentration and biomineralisation of algae exerted control on toxicants along the entire river flow. The highest bioconcentration factors were obtained for Fe, Mn and Ti which implies the biomineralisation of iron as a product of extracellular deposition on the cell walls on the organic matrices. Bioconcentration of As, Cr, Cs, Cu and Se was more important in Audouinella sp., while Cd, Co, Sr, and Zn preferentially accumulated in Spirogyra sp. High accumulation of Ba (3 mg/g d.w.) in Spirogyra sp. was associated with the intracellular biomineralisation. These findings suggest the potential use of Spirogyra sp. in the remediation of waters polluted by barium or as the biological pathfinder indicator for metal deposits associated with barite.

In this study, we identified glacial lakes in the HKH-TMHA region based on multitemporal Landsat images taken from 1990 to 2020. We analyzed the spatial distribution and evolution of glacial lakes in the HKH-TMHA region from the perspective of their elevation, size, and terrain aspect; then, we described their temporal changes. The results showed that approximately 84.56% of the glacial lakes (84.1% of the total lake area) were located at elevations between 4000 m and 5500 m, and glacial lakes with areas ranging from 0.01-0.5 km(2) accounted for approximately 95.21% of the number and 63.01% of the total area of glacial lakes. The number (38.64%) and area (58.83%) of south-facing glacial lakes were largest in HKH-TMHA and expanded significantly over time. There were 5835 (664.84 +/- 89.72 km(2)) glacial lakes in 1990; from 1990 to 2020, the number of glacial lakes in the HKH-TMHA region increased by 5974 (408.93 km(2)) in total; and the annual average increase in the area of glacial lakes reached 13.63 km(2) (11.15%). In 2020, the total number of glacial lake reached to 9673 (899.66 +/- 120.63 km(2)). In addition, most glacial lakes were located in the Eastern Himalayan, China, and the Indus Basin. Based on the precipitation and temperature analyses performed in our study area, we found inconsistent climate characteristics and changes in the three mountain ranges. In general, the daily precipitation (temperature) increased by 1.0766 mm (1.0311 degrees C), 0.8544 mm (0.8346 degrees C), and 0.8245 mm (-0.1042 degrees C) on the yearly, summer, and winter scales, respectively. Glacial melting and climate change are common contributors to glacial lake expansion. The investigation of glacial lakes in this region can provide basic supporting data for research on glacial lake-related disasters, land cover, and climate change in the high-mountain Asia region.

J	Urrutia-Cordero, P; Ekvall, MK; Hansson, LA				Urrutia-Cordero, Pablo; Ekvall, Mattias K.; Hansson, Lars-Anders			Controlling Harmful Cyanobacteria: Taxa-Specific Responses of Cyanobacteria to Grazing by Large-Bodied Daphnia in a Biomanipulation Scenario	PLOS ONE												Lake restoration practices based on reducing fish predation and promoting the dominance of large-bodied Daphnia grazers (i.e., biomanipulation) have been the focus of much debate due to inconsistent success in suppressing harmful cyanobacterial blooms. While most studies have explored effects of large-bodied Daphnia on cyanobacterial growth at the community level and/or on few dominant species, predictions of such restoration practices demand further understanding on taxa-specific responses in diverse cyanobacterial communities. In order to address these questions, we conducted three grazing experiments during summer in a eutrophic lake where the natural phytoplankton community was exposed to an increasing gradient in biomass of the large-bodied Daphnia magna. This allowed evaluating taxa-specific responses of cyanobacteria to Daphnia grazing throughout the growing season in a desired biomanipulation scenario with limited fish predation. Total cyanobacterial and phytoplankton biomasses responded negatively to Daphnia grazing both in early and late summer, regardless of different cyanobacterial densities. Large-bodied Daphnia were capable of suppressing the abundance of Aphanizomenon, Dolichospermum, Microcystis and Planktothrix bloom-forming cyanobacteria. However, the growth of the filamentous Dolichospermum crassum was positively affected by grazing during a period when this cyanobacterium dominated the community. The eutrophic lake was subjected to biomanipulation since 2005 and nineteen years of lake monitoring data (1996-2014) revealed that reducing fish predation increased the mean abundance (50%) and body-size (20%) of Daphnia, as well as suppressed the total amount of nutrients and the growth of the dominant cyanobacterial taxa, Microcystis and Planktothrix. Altogether our results suggest that lake restoration practices solely based on grazer control by large-bodied Daphnia can be effective, but may not be sufficient to control the overgrowth of all cyanobacterial diversity. Although controlling harmful cyanobacterial blooms should preferably include other measures, such as nutrient reductions, our experimental assessment of taxa-specific cyanobacterial responses to large-bodied Daphnia and long-term monitoring data highlights the potential of such biomanipulations to enhance the ecological and societal value of eutrophic water bodies.

Retrospective Analyses of Inputs of Municipal Wastewater Effluent and Coupled Impacts on an Urban Lake	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												A retrospective review and analysis are presented of the evolution of treatment, point of discharge considerations, and constituent loading from the Metropolitan Syracuse Wastewater Treatment Plant (Metro), and the coupled water quality effects on the receiving urban lake (Onondaga Lake, New York) from the early 1970s to 2010. The analysis is based on long-term monitoring of the discharge, Onondaga Lake, and a nearby river system considered as a potential alternate to receive the effluent. The Metro discharge is extraordinarily large relative to the lake's hydrologic budget, representing approximately 25% of the total inflow, greater than for any other lake in the United States. The large loads of nitrogen and phosphorus received from the facility resulted in severe water quality effects in the lake during the early portion of record, including (1) violations of standards to protect against toxic effects of ammonia and nitrite, (2) violations of the water clarity standard for swimming safety, (3) exceedances of a limit for the summer average concentration of total phosphorus in the upper waters, and (4) lakewide violations of the oxygen standard during fall turnover. The effects of Metro were compounded by effects of discharges from soda ash/chlor-alkali and pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities. The sedimentary record of the lake indicates that even greater levels of cultural eutrophication prevailed before the monitoring commenced. Dramatic improvements in the water quality of the lake were achieved in recent years by implementing advanced treatment technologies. Exceedances of receiving water limits in the lake were eliminated, with the exception of the total phosphorus limit. A zebra mussel invasion compromised the oxygen resources and assimilative capacity of the nearby river for more than 15 years. This eliminated an option, previously supported by managers, of full diversion of the Metro effluent to the river. Water Environ. Res., 85, 13 (2013).

In the latter year, 3 additional plots were also censused. The ratio between combined densities of hole-nesting birds on the mainland and on islands was 3:1 both in plots without and with nest boxes. In plots with boxes combined densities of hole-nesting birds doubled compared with control plots. This increase was caused by a tenfold increase of pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca. Territories of this species were on average established about a week later on the islands compared with the mainland. Furthermore, 50% of the males on the islands did not attract a female. Densities of great tit Parus major, marsh tit P. palustris and nuthatch Sitta europaea were unaffected by increased nesthole availability. For P. major this result contrasts with those in other studies. The density of chaffinch Fringilla coelebs in habitats with similar height and vertical structure was 2 times higher on the islands compared to the mainland. The density was the same on islands with only 1 pair and on those with 2 or more pairs. In spring, there were no significant differences between islands and the mainland in the proportion of leaves with insect feeding traces. The proportion of Salix leaves with feeding traces increased with island size, but this was not so for Alnus and Betula leaves. In late summer, the proportion of leaves with feeding traces were halved inside a plot with nest boxes and hence increased bird densities compared to a nearby control plot. This result was the same along the lake shore and about 150 m away from the shore. The discussion centers on the effect of man on the food- and nest site-availability of hole-nesting birds, food limitation of insectivorous birds and density compensation on islands.

DISCOVERY OF FOG AT THE SOUTH POLE OF TITAN	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS												While Saturn's moon Titan appears to support an active methane hydrological cycle, no direct evidence for surface-atmosphere exchange has yet appeared. The indirect evidence, while compelling, could be misleading. It is possible, for example, that the identified lake features could be filled with ethane, an involatile long-term residue of atmospheric photolysis; the apparent stream and channel features could be ancient remnants of a previous climate; and the tropospheric methane clouds, while frequent, could cause no rain to reach the surface. We report here the detection of fog at the south pole of Titan during late summer using observations from the VIMS instrument on board the Cassini spacecraft. While terrestrial fog can form from a variety of causes, most of these processes are inoperable on Titan. Fog on Titan can only be caused by evaporation of nearly pure liquid methane; the detection of fog provides the first direct link between surface and atmospheric methane. Based on the detections presented here, liquid methane appears widespread at the south pole of Titan in late southern summer, and the hydrological cycle on Titan is currently active.

Preliminary experimental lime treatment showed that this approach had a great potential to reduce phosphorus content and algal biomass. Therefore, two pairs of experimental and reference lakes were selected for a whole lake lime treatment and monitored for a full year prior to manipulation. This study presents the composition and size structure of the zooplankton community of the lakes before treatment in order to assess the natural summer and inter-lake variations. Before lime treatment, seasonal means of total zooplankton abundance and biomass ranged from 17 +/- 8 to 127 +/- 84 ind. L-1 and from 4 +/- 2 to 138 +/- 236 mg m-3, respectively. The two experimental lakes (Halfmoon and Lofty) were the richest in zooplankton while the references lakes (Crooked and Jenkins) were the poorest. A total of 30 zooplankton species (17 rotifers, 2 calanoids, 4 cyclopoids and 7 cladocerans) were recorded as well as 3 chaoborid species. The composition and size structure of zooplankton varied between lakes and dates. Rotifers accounted for the majority of zooplankton abundances (59-91 %) while Cladocera (78-99%) or Copepoda (74%) in Crooked lake formed most of the zooplankton biomass. Summer variations of the zooplankton groups were described along with changes in size spectra. The temporal variation and the inter-lake differences in zooplankton structure were discussed in relation to trophy, fish and invertebrate predation, and cyanophyte interactions.

Optically stimulated luminescence and C-14 ages from nearby terraced aggradational alluvial deposits indicate a paucity of large floods in the Late Pleistocene and at least five large flood events in the last c. 6 kyr, interpreted to mark an increased frequency of extreme rainfall events in the middle Holocene despite overall reduced EP. Increased EP in south-central Australia during the early to middle Holocene resulted from (1) decreased El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability, which reduced the frequency of El Nino-triggered droughts, (2) the prevalence of a more La Nina-like mean climatic state in the tropical Pacific Ocean, which increased available atmospheric moisture, and (3) a southward shift in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ICTZ), which allowed tropical summer storms associated with the Australian summer monsoon (ASM) to penetrate deeper into the southern part of the continent. The onset of heightened aridity and apparent increase in large flood frequency at c. 5 ka is interpreted to indicate the establishment of an ENSO-like climate in arid Australia in the late Holocene, consistent with a variety of other terrestrial and marine proxies. The broad synchroneity of Holocene climate change across much of the Australian continent with changes in ENSO behavior suggests strong teleconnections amongst ENSO and the other climate systems such as the ASM, Indian Ocean Dipole, and Southern Annular Mode.					; Sandiford, Mike/B-5020-2016; Hellstrom, John/B-1770-2008	Horton, Travis/0000-0003-0558-2970; Hellstrom, John/0000-0001-9427-3525; Sandiford, Mike/0000-0002-9757-745X; QUIGLEY, MARK/0000-0002-4430-4212													0959-6836	1477-0911				NOV	2010	20	7					1093	1104		10.1177/0959683610369508	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683610369508													WOS:000282765300007

BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY												Economy of locomotion is a constant challenge for animals, particularly when related to migrations and travelling. The present study focuses on human locomotion and particularly on the development of ice skating. The aim of our research was to understand whether an environmental feature such as a strong presence of lakes (frozen in winter) could force humans to develop ice skates in order to limit the energy cost of travelling. We hypothesized that the energy-saving principle was a determinant factor in the development of human locomotion on ice. Five healthy adult participants took part in the experiments, during which we recorded the speed (1.2 +/- 0.3 m s(-1)) and metabolic energy cost (4.6 +/- 0.9 J kg(-1) m(-1)) associated with travelling on bone skates. Simulations were also performed to demonstrate whether the benefit given by the use of skates was different in the areas where ice skating appears to have evolved originally. The gain reachable by using bone skates could lead to an extremely high energy saving (equal to 10% of the energy needed to survive during the cold season) and differs significantly between the regions considered in the present study. An analysis of the geometrical shape of lakes associated with fractal analysis of their distribution suggests that, in order to better adapt to the severe conditions imposed by the long lasting winters, Finnish populations could benefit more than others from developing this ingenious locomotion tool.

Atmospheric Scale Interaction on Wintertime Intermountain West Low-Level Inversions	WEATHER AND FORECASTING												Persistent winter inversions result in poor air quality in the Intermountain West of the United States. Although the onset of an inversion is relatively easy to predict, the duration and the subsequent breakup of a persistent inversion event remains a forecasting challenge. For this reason and for this region, historic soundings were analyzed for Salt Lake City, Utah, with reanalysis and station data to investigate how persistent inversion events are modulated by synoptic and intraseasonal variabilities. The results point to a close linkage between persistent inversions and the dominant intraseasonal (30 day) mode that characterizes the winter circulation regime over the Pacific Northwest. Meteorological variables and pollution (e. g., particulate matter of <= 2.5-mu m diameter, PM2.5) revealed coherent variations with this intraseasonal mode. The intraseasonal mode also modulates the characteristics of the synoptic (6 day) variability and further influences the duration of persistent inversions in the Intermountain West. The interaction between modes suggests that a complete forecast of persistent inversions is more involved and technically beyond numerical weather prediction models intended for the medium range (similar to 10 day). Therefore, to predict persistent inversions, the results point to the adoption of standard medium-range forecasts with a longer-term climate diagnostic approach.

Holocene vegetation and biomass changes on the Tibetan Plateau - a model-pollen data comparison	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												Results of a transient numerical experiment performed in a coupled atmosphere-ocean-vegetation model with orbital forcing alone are compared to pollen-based vegetation reconstructions covering the last 6000 yr from four representative sites on the Tibetan Plateau. Causes of the vegetation change and consequences of the biomass storage are analysed. In general, simulated and reconstructed vegetation trends at each site are in good agreement. Both methods reveal a general retreat of the biomass-rich vegetation that is particularly manifested in a strong decrease of forests. However, model and reconstructions often differ with regard to the climatic factors causing the vegetation change at each site. The reconstructions primarily identify decreasing summer monsoon precipitation and changes in the temperature of the warm season as the responsible mechanisms for the vegetation shift. In the model, the land cover change mainly originates from differences in warm/cold seasonal temperatures and only to a lesser extent from precipitation changes. According to the model results, the averaged forest fraction on the Plateau shrinks by almost one-third from mid-Holocene (41.4 %) to present-day (28.3 %). Shrubs, whose fraction is quadrupled at present-day (12.3 %), replace most of this forest. Grass fraction increases from 38.1% during the mid-Holocene to 42.3% at present-day. This land cover change results in a decrease of living biomass by 0.62 kgC m(-2). Total biomass on the Tibetan Plateau decreases by 1.9 kgC m(-2), i.e. approx. 6.64 PgC are released due to the natural land cover change.

Ecology and nutrition of invasive Caulerpa brachypus f. parvifolia blooms on coral reefs off southeast Florida, USA	HARMFUL ALGAE												Coral reefs off southeast Florida have experienced an unprecedented succession of invasive chlorophyte blooms over the past two decades, most recently the non-native Caulerpa brachypus f. parvifolia. To better understand the ecology and nutrition of the C. brachypus invasion, we monitored benthic cover, water column dissolved inorganic nutrients, tissue C:N:P ratios and stable nitrogen isotopes (delta(15)N) of C. brachypus and native chlorophytes (Caulerpa racemosa, Caulerpa verticillata, Caulerpa mexicana, Codium isthmocladum) quarterly at two reef sites - the Princess Anne (PA) and North Colonel's Ledge (NCL) - in 2003-2004. The PA site was influenced by stormwater discharges from the Lake Worth inlet whereas NCL was farther distant from these discharges. Between winter and spring of 2003, C. brachypus became the dominant benthic chlorophyte, expanding to >60% cover at both PA and NCL. Following cold temperatures (13 degrees C) associated with strong upwelling and high nitrate concentrations (21 mu M) at NCL in July 2003, C brachypus cover decreased, suggesting that upwelling can stress growth of this tropical alga. Mean ammonium (0.60 mu M), nitrate (2.7 mu M) and DIN (3.2 mu M) concentrations were high for coral reef environments. Low mean C:N ratios of similar to 13 in C. brachypus at both PA and NCL indicated little, if any, N-limitation compared to higher C:N ratios (up to 24) and greater N-limitation in native chlorophytes. Despite a relatively high mean SRP concentration (0.21 mu M), mean N:P ratios of similar to 39 in C. brachypus and other chlorophytes at PA and NCL suggested that these blooms were P-limited. Multiple lines of evidence support the hypothesis that land-based nutrient sources fueled the C. brachypus invasion. First, more persistent blooms of C brachypus at PA compared to NCL correlated with significantly lower tissue C:P and higher delta(15)N values (wet season) at PA, the site most directly influenced by land-based stormwater runoff. Second, C:N, C:P, and delta(15)N values of C. brachypus correlated with seasonal patterns of rainfall and stormwater runoff. Third, delta(15)N values of C. brachypus and other chlorophytes decreased at NCL following strong upwelling in July 2003, confirming that upwelled nitrate was not the cause of the elevated delta(15)N values observed in these blooms. Lastly, the mean delta(15)N values of C. brachypus and other chlorophytes off southeast Florida (+4.9 parts per thousand) were in the range of sewage nitrogen and significantly higher than values (+1.2 parts per thousand) for reference chlorophytes in the Abacos, Bahamas, an area that experiences relatively little sewage input.

J	Hudcovicová, M; Vranovsky, M				Hudcovicova, Martina; Vranovsky, Marian			Vertical distribution of pelagial zooplankton in a middle-sized dimictic valley reservoir	BIOLOGIA												Our observations indicate the vertical distribution of zooplankton and its seasonal changes in Dubnik II reservoir (Slovakia) are determined mainly by the thermal regime of the reservoir, by transparency, and by fish and invertebrate predation. During periods of circulation, zooplankton vertical distribution in the whole column was more homogeneous, whilst during summer temperature stratification zooplankton concentrated in the epilemnion - rotifers in higher layers than crustaceans. During summer stagnation a steep thermal gradient occurred at the boundary of the epi- hypolimnion and low temperature and low dissolved oxygen in hypolimnion offered a refuge for Chaoborus flavicans larvae against fish, enabling coexistence of vertebrate and invertebrate predation. This evidence supports our previous findings concerning dominance of rotifers in zooplankton and representation of crustaceans by small-bodied species in the study reservoir. Sleep thermal gradient and the presence of Chaoborus larvae caused very low zooplankton abudance in the lower part of the water column and a reduction of cladocerans refuges against fish to layers of thermocline or closely under thermocline where Daphnia cucullata and Daphnia parvula were found. Our previous assumptions about the high density of zooplanktivorous fish in Dubnik II reservoir are supported by the fact that these small cladocerans are represented by smaller individuals in the upper layers and bigger individuals in deeper layers.					; Hudcovicova, Martina/JEO-7562-2023	Hudcovicova, Martina/0000-0001-7260-3087; 													0006-3088					MAR	2006	61	2					171	177		10.2478/s11756-006-0028-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11756-006-0028-6													WOS:000237585700014
J	GYSELMAN, EC				GYSELMAN, EC			FIDELITY OF ANADROMOUS ARCTIC CHAR (SALVELINUS-ALPINUS) TO NAUYUK LAKE, NWT, CANADA	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												The estimated fidelity of anadromous Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) returning to Nauyuk Lake from 1974 to 1978 was low (53%). Seven percent of the fish were absent for 1 or 2 yr before returning. Fidelity was also size dependant. Intermediate-sized fish (35-65 cm) had the highest estimated fidelity, while smaller and larger fish had lower rates. The char leaving Nauyuk Lake each spring were categorized into three groups: postspawning char, char that had been observed returning to Nauyuk Lake at least once, and char that had not shown any fidelity to Nauyuk Lake in the past. The char that had shown fidelity to Nauyuk Lake previously had the highest fidelity rate (75%), while the postspawning char and those that had not shown any previous fidelity to Nauyuk Lake both had a fidelity rate of 45%. The low fidelity of the postspawning char was attributed to a higher mortality rate. Fidelity could not be correlated with the length of time a fish was at sea or when it left Nauyuk Lake in the spring.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				SEP	1994	51	9					1927	1934		10.1139/f94-194	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f94-194													WOS:A1994QF32000003
J	Wang, TX; Xu, SG; Liu, JW				Wang, Tianxiang; Xu, Shiguo; Liu, Jianwei			Dynamic Assessment of Comprehensive Water Quality Considering the Release of Sediment Pollution	WATER												Comprehensive assessment of water quality is an important technological measure for water environmental management and protection. Previous assessment methods tend to ignore the influences of sediment pollutant release and dynamic change of the water boundary. In view of this, this paper explores a new method for comprehensive water quality assessment. Laboratory simulation experiments are conducted to analyze the influences of sediment pollutant release on water quality, and the results are taken as increments, coupled with original samples, to constitute a new set of evaluation samples. Dynamic and comprehensive water quality assessment methods are created based on a principal component analysis (PCA)/analytic hierarchy process (AHP)-variable fuzzy pattern recognition (VFPR) model and adopted to evaluate water quality. A geographic information system (GIS) is applied to visually display the results of water quality assessment and the change of the water boundary. This study takes Biliuhe Reservoir as an engineering example. The results show the change process of the water boundary, during which the water level is reduced from 63.10 m to 54.15 m. The reservoir water quality is fine, of which the water quality level (GB3838-2002) is between level 2 and level 3, and closer to level 2 taking no account of sediment pollutant release. The water quality of Biliuhe Reservoir, overall, is worse in summer and better in winter during the monitoring period. Meanwhile, the water quality shows the tendency of being better from upstream to downstream, and the water quality in the surface layer is better than that in the bottom layer. However, water quality is much closer, or even inferior, to level 3 when considering the release of nitrogen and phosphorus in sediments, and up to 42.7% of the original assessment results of the samples undergo changes. It is concluded that the proposed method is comparatively reasonable as it avoids neglecting sediment pollutant release in the water quality assessment, and the presentation of the evaluation results and change of the water boundary is intuitive with the application of GIS.					; Liu, Jianwei/AFT-0717-2022	Wang, Tianxiang/0000-0002-8360-0559; 														2073-4441				APR	2017	9	4							275	10.3390/w9040275	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w9040275													WOS:000404556400045

Given that NCEP's Climate Forecast System (CFS) has demonstrated skill in the prediction of the ISO as far out as 1 month, it was decided to examine the CFS forecast's capability in the prediction of such winter persistent inversions. After initial analysis, a simple regression scheme is proposed that is coupled to the CFS output of geopotential height as a way to predict the occurrence of persistent inversion events for Salt Lake City, Utah. Analysis of the CFS hindcasts through the period 1981-2008 indicates that the regression coupled with the CFS can predict persistent inversion events with lead times of up to 4 weeks. The adoption of this coupled regression-CFS prediction may improve the forecasting of persistent inversion events in the Intermountain West, which is currently restricted to the more limited time span (similar to 10 days) of medium-range weather forecast models.

The purposes of the work described here were to determine the extent of the invasion, the rate of spread, and the relationship between the abundance of the snail and calcium ion concentration, pH, and conductivity. In two independent sampling efforts, we sampled Spring Creek in Centre County, Pennsylvania, at various times from 2014 to 2018. We also sampled tributaries of the stream as well as the larger watershed of Bald Eagle Creek. In addition, we established sites to monitor other streams that are likely to be frequented by recreational water users (a known snail dispersal agent). We found that compared to the geographic distribution in 2014, the snail increased its geographic range, and snail abundance increased at most locations. We also found evidence of expansion out of the Spring Creek watershed into the larger Bald Eagle Creek watershed at two locations in 2018. Snail abundance was positively related to pH and conductivity in 2017. We recommend that streams in central Pennsylvania be routinely monitored for the presence of this species, especially those regularly visited by recreational water users and that have chemical characteristics favorable to the NZMS.

Trees in treatments 1 and 2 received normal rainfall during the winter, but treatment 3 received no rain. Normal irrigation was resumed on all treatments in mid March. Soil was collected using root auger head (0.09 m diameter and height 0.25 m) in two opposing quadrants (West and East at 3 horizontal distances from tree trunk (1, 2 and 3 m) and 4 depths (0.0-0.15; 0.15-0.30; 0.30-0.60 and 0.60-0.90 m).

Most 1- and 2-yr-old fish were littoral; with increasing age, pelagic and deeper benthic habitats were utilized. The significant habitat segregation is caused by differential foraging profitabilities and social interactions among age groups. The proportion of females was significantly higher in pelagic than in benthic areas. Among mature fish, the males, but not the females, congregated in onshore areas in Sept. before entering the tributaries to spawn in Oct.-Nov. Age groups 1-2 fed mainly on littoral zoobenthos. In Aug., when zooplankton and surface insects were abundant, age-2 fish also were numerous offshore. Older benthic fish fed largely on chironomid larvae and pupae. Surface insects and zooplankton were important food for pelagic brown trout. Adult chironomids mainly were eaten during early summer, swarming ants during late summer. Holopedium gibberum and Bythotrephes longimanus were the selected zooplankton; smaller cladocerans were not eatern.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					1983	112	1					27	37		10.1577/1548-8659(1983)112<27:AASSIH>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1983)112<27:AASSIH>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1983QC25800003

M.; D'Andrea, William J.; Werner, Johannes P.; Bakke, Jostein			Early Holocene Temperature Oscillations Exceed Amplitude of Observed and Projected Warming in Svalbard Lakes	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Arctic climate is uniquely sensitive to ongoing warming. The feedbacks that drive this amplified response remain insufficiently quantified and misrepresented in model scenarios of future warming. Comparison with paleotemperature reconstructions from past warm intervals can help close this gap. The Early Holocene (11.7-8.2 ka BP) is an important target because Arctic temperatures were warmer than today. This study presents centennially resolved summer temperature reconstructions from three Svalbard lakes. We show that Early Holocene temperatures fluctuated between the coldest and warmest extremes of the past 12 ka, exceeding the range of instrumental observations and future projections. Peak warmth occurred similar to 10 ka BP, with temperatures 7 degrees C warmer than today due to high radiative forcing and intensified inflow of warm Atlantic waters. Between 9.5 and 8 ka BP, temperatures dropped in response to freshwater fluxes from melting ice. Facing similar mechanisms, our findings may provide insight into the near-future response of Arctic climate. Plain Language Summary The Arctic warms much faster than the global average. This amplified response can trigger feedbacks that affect the trajectory of future change. In areas formerly covered by ice, darker open water or rocks reflect less solar heat, enhancing warming. However, freshwater from melting ice may slow ocean circulation, leading to cooling. The climate impact of these mechanisms remain insufficiently understood, restricting efforts to predict future change. To reduce uncertainty, our research uses geological information from the most recent past period when the Arctic was warmer than the present, the Early Holocene, which lasted from 11,700 to 8,200 years ago. We analyzed fats from algae preserved in Svalbard lakes that yield information about past summer temperatures. Our findings show that the Early Holocene was characterized by the coldest and warmest extremes experienced since the last Ice Age. During peak warmth, summer temperatures were 7 degrees C warmer than today as more solar radiation and warm water reached the Arctic. However, Early Holocene warming was much slower than today. But warming was interrupted when freshwater pulses from melting Ice Sheets lowered temperatures. As we face a warmer Arctic with a melting Greenland Ice Sheet, our findings provide a rare window into the region's future.

Local climatic drivers of changes in phenology at a boreal-temperate ecotone in eastern North America	CLIMATIC CHANGE												Ecosystems in biogeographical transition zones, or ecotones, tend to be highly sensitive to climate and can provide early indications of future change. To evaluate recent climatic changes and their impacts in a boreal-temperate ecotone in eastern North America, we analyzed ice phenology records (1975-2007) for five lakes in the Adirondack Mountains of northern New York State. We observed rapidly decreasing trends of up to 21 days less ice cover, mostly due to later freeze-up and partially due to earlier break-up. To evaluate the local drivers of these lake ice changes, we modeled ice phenology based on local climate data, derived climatic predictors from the models, and evaluated trends in those predictors to determine which were responsible for observed changes in lake ice. November and December temperature and snow depth consistently predicted ice-in, and recent trends of warming and decreasing snow during these months were consistent with later ice formation. March and April temperature and snow depth consistently predicted ice-out, but the absence of trends in snow depth during these months, despite concurrent warming, resulted in much weaker trends for ice-out. Recent rates of warming in the Adirondacks are among the highest regionally, although with a different seasonality of changes (early winter > late winter) that is consistent with other lake ice records in the surrounding area. Projected future declines in snow cover could create positive feedbacks and accelerate current rates of ice loss due to warming. Climate sensitivity was greatest for the larger lakes in our study, including Wolf Lake, considered one of the most ecologically intact 'wilderness lakes' in eastern North America. Our study provides further evidence of climate sensitivity of the boreal-temperate ecotone of eastern North America and points to emergent conservation challenges posed by climate change in legally protected yet vulnerable landscapes like the Adirondack Park.					; Stella, John/B-5668-2009; Dovciak, Martin/K-3140-2012	Stella, John/0000-0001-6095-7726; Dovciak, Martin/0000-0002-9428-3122													0165-0009	1573-1480				NOV	2012	115	2					399	417		10.1007/s10584-012-0455-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-012-0455-z													WOS:000309867100008

This heat is then released at night. The aim of this paper is to analyze this cooling process by quantifying the magnitude of turbulent, latent and sensible, heat fluxes in comparison to radiative and ground fluxes. A detailed vertical temperature profile was measured in an urban pond (similar to 70 cm deep with surface area of 3,627 m(2)) in Delft (NL) using Distributed Temperature Sensing for a period of one month. The results show that, from the total of 2.7 MJm(-2) of heat released by the pond on an average summer night, 43% of the thermal energy is emitted as longwave radiation, 39% as latent energy, and only 11% as sensible heat. An additional 0.10-0.32 MJm(-2) is transferred into the bottom of the lake. Temperature distribution and cooling of the water profile is influenced by weather conditions during the preceding day. This paper provides an insight into a behavioral pattern of an urban pond at night. The results can shed some light into the potential of urban bodies to increase the air temperature of their surroundings at night.																				2296-6463				JUN 21	2019	7								156	10.3389/feart.2019.00156	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2019.00156													WOS:000472626400001

We analyzed the physicochemical and phytoplankton data of the lake obtained from 1991 to 2007 during the austral summers. At the beginning of January 2001, a sudden water level drop (similar to 3 m) occurred in Lake Boeckella as a consequence of an extremely high water discharge to the sea. This was triggered by the progressive thawing of the permafrost in the basin of the system. After this disturbance, nutrients, conductivity, chlorophyll a (Chl a) and picoplankton density showed strong peaks. The pre-draining and post-draining periods showed significant differences for most of the limnological variables analyzed. Secchi disk depth significantly decreased throughout the study period, resulting in a thinner euphotic layer. Chrysophyceae and Volvocales dominated the > 2 mu m phytoplankton fraction in the lake, but from 2004 onwards, other small-sized eukaryotic algae (3-5 mu m) also became very abundant. Autotrophic picoplankton showed a significant peak during the summer when the water level decreased. A shift in their composition was observed through the study period: in 1998, picocyanobacteria were numerically dominant; from 2002 onwards, picoeukaryotes increased and became dominant in 2004. This study suggests that climate change may trigger the thawing of the permafrost in the catchments of Maritime Antarctic lakes, leading to catastrophic draining events, which favor natural eutrophication processes.

Removal of fish by fishing, or stocking the lake with desired fish species has the potential to modify fish populations (their size/age structure, abundance and biomass) and various other ecosystem components and thus affect water quality. Analysis of long-termdata onthe catches of commercially important fish species, stocking of fingerlings, lake water levels, and littoral modifications, allowed revealing the key factors affecting the fish populations, fishing pressure, and mass of landed fish. Long-term decreasesin water level negatively affected reproduction and survival of natural/stocked fingerlings of some cyprinids (Mirogrex terraesanctae, Hypophthalamichthys molitrix, Cyprinus carpio) and cichlids(Sarotherodon galilaeus, Oreochromis aureus). In contrast, rapid rises in water level vastly enlarged the areas of inundated terrestrial vegetation and stony/rocky littoral and thus positively affected the reproduction and survival of these fish and their landing after a temporallag. Fishing pressure on reproductively active large cichlidswas enhanced at low water levelsdue to exposing these fish at spawning time (spring and summer) to fishermen. Such overfishing resulted in lowering the number of reproductively capable cichlids below a certain critical level, leading to a decrease in the reproductive capacity of the population and the collapse of its standing stock (i.e. "recruitment overfishing"). The endemic bleak, Mirogrex terraesanctae is the dominant pelagic zooplanktivore of Lake Kinneret. Large water level fluctuationsimpacted its reproduction and determinedthe abundance of this ecologically important species. Biomanipulation, by mean of subsidized harvesting, implemented to suppress its abundance in critical years, was highly controversial, and was stopped in 2006. Of the stocked grey mullets, Mugil cephalus had lower natural mortality rate, higher growth rate, reached larger sizes, and thus had a higher market value than Liza ramada. Still, fingerlings of the second species were more readily available, such that L. ramada was stocked in larger numbers and was more abundant in the commercial catch. We argue that fish stock management in Lake Kinneret should focus on the restoration of native fish populations and their sustainable fishery.

Flooding of the lake started in 2008 with water from mining sites, water basin of the lake and from river. We discovered a chemocline that disappeared after autumn circulation in 2009, but only in east part of the lake. Three months experimental filling of the lake with water from river at zoio caused another chemocline all over the lake. Besides of the lake Medard, another post mining-pit Boil Poiehnani is monitored.																					978-3-00-035543-1				2011							551	556																WOS:000391415200100

Sedimentological characteristics, chronological analyses and morphotectonic parameters were used to describe the spatial and temporal variability in the patterns of aggradation, landform evolution and neotectonic influences in the study. Our results indicate that valley aggradation processes occurred around the transitional zone in the southern front of the SP during the mid-late Holocene era along with a hiatus in sediment deposition after 4.3 ka. Sediment generation and aggradation is modulated by precipitation anomalies associated with the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) variability whereas morphometric analysis suggests that activity along the Dauki-Dapsi fault has been contributing to the uplift-related deformation. Sedimentological observation supported by optically stimulated luminescence chronology obtained on palaeoflood deposits, valley-fill fluvial terraces and alluvial fans indicate their deposition during three pluvial phases: (i) 5.3-4.3 ka, (ii) 2.4-1.0 ka and (ii) 0.7-0.3 ka. Our data indicate that valley aggradation and geomorphic processes in the southern part of SP responded to short-term changes in the ISM variability with contributions from the morphotectonic activities associated with the Dauki-Dapsi fault during the late Holocene period.

J	Scharf, W				Scharf, Wilfried			Biomanipulation as a useful water quality management tool in deep stratifying reservoirs	HYDROBIOLOGIA												In six deep, soft-water reservoirs, ranging from oligotrophic to eutrophic, fishery management has been guided by the use of biomanipulation to improve water quality and opportunities for recreational fishing. As evidenced by the establishment of larger-bodied daphnids, a low level of zooplanktivory could be maintained in the newly filled Grosse Dhunn and refilled Brucher and Lingese Reservoirs only by regular stocking of piscivores (Sander lucioperca, Esox lucius, Salmo trutta lacustris, Onchorhynchus mykiss) in combination with size and bag limitations for the recreational fisheries. However, in the mesotrophic Pre-Reservoir Grosse Dhunn, Bever Reservoir and the newly filled slightly eutrophic Wupper Reservoir it took between 8 and 10 years before the predator-resistant zooplankton community responded to management with a switch to larger daphnids. Except for oligotrophic Grosse Dhunn Reservoir where angling is prohibited, the expected enhancement of piscivore biomass through stocking not least was prevented by anglers. However, growth of perch (Perca fluviatilis) benefited from the changed fishery management relying upon stocking piscivores only allowing them to reach the size of piscivory. The appearance of larger daphnids in Pre-Reservoir Grosse Dhunn and Wupper Reservoir resulted in the biomass of the Daphnia spring peak to increase and occur earlier causing prolonged clear water conditions. Although the larger daphnids increased transparency, total summer mean chlorophyll concentrations in the euphotic zone only decreased in the slightly eutrophic reservoirs due to reduced phosphorus availability following unchanged external phosphorus loadings. Reduced phosphorus availability in these reservoirs caused a real oligotrophication. Although the edible seston fraction was controlled "top down" the results did not support the trophic cascade hypotheses because total phytoplankton remained controlled "bottom up", admittedly triggered by "top down" forces. In general, the results support the importance of indirect (non-lethal) effects as the driving forces for the successful biomanipulations, particularly in slightly eutrophic reservoirs. Not least, the delayed zooplankton response provides an indication that the underlying change of internal feedbacks was not driven by external forces to stabilize the reservoirs trophic state in these deep stratifying reservoirs.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2007	583						21	42		10.1007/s10750-006-0471-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-006-0471-y													WOS:000245358700002

A non-metric traits study of skulls from Epiclassic Xaltocan in relation to other Mesoamerican cultures	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE-REPORTS												This study focuses on the analysis of a group of decapitated crania, which date to the Epiclassic period (ca. 600-900 CE). The crania were excavated from a small ritual site in the former lake bed of Lake Xaltocan, in the Basin of Mexico. Using non-metric cranial attributes, we undertook an intergroup analysis using an MMD biodistance. To place the Lake Xaltocan remains in a regional and historical biological context, we examined and recorded 13 non-metric, cranial features in 276 skulls from sites throughout central Mexico, including Tlatilco (N-1 = 78), Teotihuacan (N-2 = 66), Valle de Toluca (N-3 = 33), and Xaltocan (N-4 = 118). The results indicate that the most closely associated groups are Xaltocan and Valle de Toluca. Nevertheless, biodistance data indicate that all the groups significantly differ from one another, with a level of confidence of alpha = 6.6 x 10(-6). This finding points to the existence of biological discontinuity among all the samples. Our results fall in line with existing proposals asserting that, after the fall of Teotihuacan, an intense population mobility occurred in central Mexico.

Distribution of suspended particulate matter in the northern Bohai Bay in summer and its relation with thermocline	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE					Workshop on Dynamics of Chinese Muddy Coasts and Estuaries	SEP, 2009	Guilin, PEOPLES R CHINA	State Key Lab Ocean Remote Sensing & Dynam, Second Inst Oceanography, SOA, China, LOICZ, EMECS				Field observations of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in the Bohai Bay, China have not been widely reported. The aim of this paper is to describe the horizontal and vertical distribution of mass and volume concentrations of SPM, respectively, based on observed data at 312 stations in the northern Bohai Bay during summer of 2006. A numerical model ECOMSED coupled with a sediment transport module was also established to further discuss the mechanism of the thermocline effect on the vertical distribution of SPM. The mass concentrations of SPM exhibited high inshore values and low offshore values in the horizontal distribution; while in the vertical direction, characteristics of the volume concentration of SPM can be divided into two types: one with a sharp peak at depth of 10-15 m and another without. The peak value at the depth of the thermocline was resulted from concentrated phytoplankton. A numerical experiment further displayed that the thermocline can also prevent particles from being resuspended upward. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We considered the spring time configuration when large freshwater lakes may have their deepest recirculation. In five very deep freshwater lakes in Norway, profiles were measured in spring 2006 with multiparameter probes. Temperature profiles confirmed thermobaric stratification in all of these lakes, i.e. the temperature profiles crossed the 4 degrees C line and thus were affected by pressure effects on the temperature of maximum density. Electrical conductance was low in all of the investigated lakes, and vertical gradients were too small to play a role in the density stratification. In all lakes, deep water was well supplied with oxygen. Three out of five lakes showed a temperature gradient close to Eklund's stability theorem. However, the remaining two lakes clearly opposed the theorem. Bottom temperatures were more closely related to lake length than their maximum depths. Oxygen saturation profiles documented recent intensive gas exchange with the atmosphere. They agree well with the possible formation of deep water from density driven flows at horizontal temperature gradients close to 4 degrees C.

Reconstruction of a high-latitude, postglacial lake: Mackellar Formation (Permian), Transantarctic Mountains	LATE PALEOZOIC GLACIAL EVENTS AND POSTGLACIAL TRANSGRESSIONS IN GONDWANA	Geological Society of America Special Papers											The Lower Permian Mackellar Formation is well exposed in a 10,000 km(2) outcrop belt in the Nimrod, Beardmore, and Shackleton Glacier areas of the Transantarctic Mountains. This formation directly overlies glacial deposits and provides a unique glimpse of high paleolatitude conditions during the last icehouse to greenhouse transition. The unit records deposition in the Mackellar Lake or Inland Sea (MLIS), a fresh-water body at similar to 80 degrees S paleolatitude that was broadly analogous to Glacial Lake Agassiz and was filled by fine-grained turbidites. Low total organic carbon (TOC) content and predominant vitrinite and inertinite are consistent with a low influx of organic matter from a sparsely vegetated, recently deglaciated terrain. A widespread but low-diversity ichnofauna and variable (although low overall) levels of bioturbation suggest oxic conditions and a bottom fauna restricted to areas of low sedimentation. Integration of sedimentologic, organic geochemical, and paleobiologic information with results of climate models and characteristics of modern lakes enhances reconstruction of parameters that controlled the functioning of the lake as an ecosystem. Regression equations relating mean annual temperature and mean depth of modern lakes to the number of ice-free days applied to the MLIS indicate ice cover from two to five months a year. Estimates of the depth of mixing and depth to the thermocline, based on maximum length, maximum width, and area, suggest a mixing depth of similar to 50 m and a thermocline of similar to 20 m. The MLIS probably was stratified during the summer and was dimictic, with overturns occurring after fall cooling and after ice melt; mixing was enhanced by turbidity currents. Productivity was low, as recorded by the low TOC, but organic matter fixed in the surface water of the lake may have been degraded and not recorded in the sediments. In spite of its high paleolatitude, the MLIS as reconstructed was dynamic and biologically active; the same probably was true of other Permian postglacial lakes.																			0072-1077		978-0-8137-2468-3				2010	468						193	207		10.1130/2010.2468(09)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/2010.2468(09)													WOS:000286335100010

Natural and constructed littoral zones as nutrient traps in eutrophicated shallow lakes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												It is generally known that the water quality of shallow lakes can be influenced significantly by marginal wetlands. In order to study the efficacy of constructed littoral wetlands in the IJsselmeer area (The Netherlands) for water quality improvement, a field survey was carried out in 2003. Vegetation, soil, pore water and surface water characteristics were measured in spring and summer in two types of littoral zones: natural and constructed for 8-16 years. The study showed that constructed wetlands perform well and are suitable to enlarge the vegetated littoral zone in the IJsselmeer area. In both natural and constructed sites vegetation biomass varied between 2,200 g m(-2) for helophyte vegetation and 1,300 g m(-2) for low herbaceous vegetation. Nutrient concentrations in the pore water of constructed sites tended to be higher than in natural sites. PO43- and NH4+ concentrations in pore water were much lower when vegetation was present, probably as a result of plant uptake. The N and P accumulation rate in the soil of constructed wetlands was 20 g N m(-2) y(-1) and 3 g P m(-2) y(-1) in vegetated plots; without vegetation the rate was much lower (8 g N m(-2) y(-1) and 1.8 g P m(-2) y(-1)). We conclude that concerning their effect on water quality, constructed sites may replace natural sites, at least after 8-16 years. Principal component analysis showed a relationship between vegetation biomass and flooding, and nutrient concentrations in soil and pore water. Biomass was negatively correlated with extractable nutrients and positively with soil total N and P content. Flooding duration was negatively related to pore water salinity and positively to pore water nutrients. Due to their high biomass, helophyte stands retained significantly more nutrients than low pioneer vegetation and are therefore more suitable for improving water quality.

J	Kawasaki, K				Kawasaki, Kazuo			Paleomagnetism of the Mn wad deposit at Niimi hot springs, Hokkaido, Japan	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												The Niimi hot springs is located at the foot of Mt. Shyakunage in the active Niseko volcanic area, Hokkaido, Japan. The manganese (Mn) wad deposit was precipitated from the hot spring water by biomineralization processes. However, no precise direct age dates for the diagenesis of such Mn oxides have been reported. Here is reported the first paleomagnetic application to date Mn oxides on 144 disseminated Mn wad and 42 pyroclastic clay specimens. The Mn wad specimens were collected at 14 levels between similar to 5.5 and similar to 62 cm in thickness on a three-dimensional grid pattern, and the clay specimens were collected at seven levels between 85 and 118 cm in thickness. Alternating field step demagnetization isolates either one or two stable characteristic remanent magnetization (ChRM) components in the Mn wad specimens. The lower coercivity component resides in pseudosingle domain titanomagnetite and shows clustered ChRM directions at each sampling level. Conversely, the higher coercivity component resides in single domain titanomagnetite and shows more random directions. The higher coercivity component is likely carried by pyroclastic fragments that landed on the site. The remanent directions of the clay specimens reside in multidomain magnetite, are less stable, and show a scattered distribution. When the observed ChRM directions of the Mn wad specimens are compared with the paleosecular variation record from Lake Biwa in Japan, the Mn wad deposition records the secular variation and appears to have lasted at least similar to 1600 years from similar to 3.5 to similar to 1.9 kyr BP.																			0008-4077	1480-3313				SEP	2019	56	9			SI		973	982		10.1139/cjes-2018-0122	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjes-2018-0122													WOS:000486365100009

This article reports on the application of a re-concentration process driven by low grade heat. It couples flash and falling film evaporation, fed by a low-grade heat source, to recover heat and concentrate process liquor. Process condensate is the stream used for this evaluation. The condenser of the re-concentration process is cooled barometrically by water from the recovery lake. The freshwater generated is either discharged or sent to the freshwater lake so as to manage the water balance of a refinery. For 200 m(3)/h process condensate simulated at two fixed temperatures of 75 degrees C and 85 degrees C, the process generates up to 36% more re-concentrated process liquor, and about 10% less specific capital cost compared to the conventional multi effect falling film evaporation system.

The fishery was substantial from its inception in 1941, with a mean annual whitefish catch of 333,500 kg over the 3 decades prior to lake impoundment. The whitefish catch prior to impoundment was composed almost exclusively (> 99%) of light colored, export (A) quality fish that were only slightly parasitized with the muscle cysts of Triaenophorus crassus. The market quality of the catch was maintained by selective fishing of certain lake basins and avoiding areas of the lake that were known to produce lower quality fish. Catch per unit of effort on traditional fishing grouds declined soon after impoundment to about 1/2 preflooding levels. Total catches were maintained at or near preimpoundment levels by major increases in total effort until 1982, when the whitefish catch fell to about 1/3 of its preimpoundment mean. Fishermen also responded to declines in catch per unit of effort on traditional fishing grounds with a major geographic shift of effort into areas formerly avoided. As a result, darker colored, continental (B) quality whitefish comprised from 12 to 72% of the summer catch in the 4 yr following impoundment. Dark whitefish are less marketable because of color and because of higher rates of Triaenophorus infestation. The mean Triaenophorus cyst count in shipments has increased markedly since impoundment and the lake was reclassified from export (A) to continental (B) classification in 1982. Catch declines on traditional fishing grounds apparently reflect the emigration of fish to other SIL basins and/or to adjoining water bodies. Prior to lake impoundment, there were significant differences in glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase allele frequencies from whitefish samples taken from 4 basins of SIL and an adjacent unconnected lake, but these differences were absent after impoundment. These stock redistributions were probably triggered by physical changes in SIL after lake impoundment.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1984	41	4					692	700		10.1139/f84-080	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f84-080													WOS:A1984SU52800013

Intercomparison of this 1994 estimate is made with earlier loading estimates made in 1988 and 1992 by Strachan and Eisenreich. The flux calculations include wet deposition, dry deposition and two-film vapour transfer across each of the lakes. Of these processes, confidence is highest for wet deposition estimates and lowest for the gas transfer component. This is unfortunate since gas transfer has been estimated to be the most important process for the OC chemicals. PCBs, dieldrin, HCB, DDE, phenanthrene and pyrene are currently showing net loss from the lakes to the atmosphere via volatilization. p,p'-DDT is still being loaded into the lakes from the atmosphere. alpha- and gamma-HCH are near equilibrium with the water bodies and show volatilization in the summer and fall for alpha-HCH but net deposition for the rest of the year. Hg assessment for the net loading to Lake Superior is given and points out the importance of each of the atmospheric deposition routes for this trace element. The results taken from the IADN program provide a detailed data set for the interpretation of atmospheric impact on the lakes. Relative assessment in relation to other sources of input is difficult due to sparsity of data in other media of the lakes. Particularly important is the inconsistent intercomparison of air and water concentrations from different years leading to gas transfer estimates which could be dated or incorrect. For chemicals which are showing rapidly changing concentrations in the lakes, the calculation of gaseous mass transfer should be made on the basis of short-term, concurrent measurements in both air and water.

The investigations were carried out from April to October in 2014. A total of 23 crustacean species were found, 17 Cladocera and six Copepoda. The species richness was the lowest in the river and the highest in the isolated Riha Lake. The total abundance, especially of some cladoceran species, was the highest in the connected Mocskos-Danube Lake in the spring during the high waters. Positive correlations of zooplankton with the organic carbon, temperature and total phosphorus were found. The correlation with chlorophyll-a was negative, indicating strong grazing pressure on the phytoplankton. The bacterioplankton, which had the highest abundance in the spring, during the flood in May, had a weak negative correlation with Copepoda and positive one with the attached bacteria, and with the alien species Eurytemora velox. Cladocera negatively affected only the medium-sized free-living bacteria. The macrophyte species Ceratophyllum demersum, better developed in Riha Lake, probably as a better competitor led to N- and P- limitations for the phytoplankton and bacterioplankton, and due to the isolation from the river these plankton communities had less development in Riha Lake compared to the Mocskos-Danube and Mohacs sites.

Life history differences parallel environmental differences among North American lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) populations	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) exhibit substantial life history variation range-wide and at a local scale. This study addresses two hypotheses that have been proposed to account for this: W over the zoogeographic range, climatic conditions are associated with life history differences; and (ii) within smaller geographic regions, physical lake attributes are associated with life history differences. Multivariate statistics (Procrustean analysis and canonical correlation analysis) identified a strong, range-wide association between climate and life history variables. Colder climates were associated with slower prematuration growth, older age at maturity, and increased longevity. Winter conditions were also important; longer, warmer winters were associated with slower prematuration growth, smaller maximum sizes, and increased weight at a standard length of 425 mm. In southern populations, these general trends were further modified by physical lake attributes. High productivity lakes had lake trout with faster prematuration growth and larger maximum sizes; deeper lakes were associated with larger maximum sizes and later ages at maturity; and larger lakes were associated with slower prematuration growth, greater longevity, and larger maximum sizes. This study identifies abiotic variables that should be incorporated into existing lake trout management models, thus extending their applicability range-wide and permitting them to deal with possible impacts of climate change.

At present, the water level is falling and the surface area contracting alarmingly. One important determinant of the water level of the lake is shown to be large-scale atmospheric circulation, expressed in terms of objective circulation weather types (CWTs), acting on the lake via regional precipitation and air temperature (as a proxy for evaporation). Seasonal changes in lake level, along with seasonal gridded precipitation and air temperature data, are shown to be strongly related to the frequency of occurrence of different CWTs.

Therefore, understanding economic rationale for landscape improvement can help managers to prioritize operational budget. The purpose of this study was to identify the determinants of golfers' repeated visitation to public golf courses and understand economic rationale for aesthetic quality improvement in public golf facilities. We surveyed golf course visitors at Lakeside Memorial Golf Course, a municipal facility in Stillwater, Oklahoma. Study results suggest that golfers' frequency to revisit was positively influenced by prestige of the facility and course design. The willingness to pay (WTP) estimates, which accounted for respondent's maximum propensity to pay above already paid green fees, for winter turfgrass enhancements were about two times higher than their estimated costs. Study results suggested landscape improvement strategies and provided several recommendations to golf course management. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Chu, T; Lindenschmidt, KE				Chu, Thuan; Lindenschmidt, Karl-Erich			Comparison and Validation of Digital Elevation Models Derived from InSAR for a Flat Inland Delta in the High Latitudes of Northern Canada	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Inaccuracies in topographic data can be a significant source of error and uncertainty for hydrologic, atmospheric-land exchange and climate change modeling. This study was conducted to examine how different data sources and techniques used to generate digital elevation models (DEM) influence DEM accuracy. Using the interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique, the system acquisition parameters and the topographic characteristics are important factors in determining DEM quality. ICESat elevation footprints and highly accurate ground control points (based on GPS measurements) are used as independent references to validate the accuracy of DEMs. The TanDEM-X DEM shows the highest accuracy among all studied DEM products, with the root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.9 m, followed by 3.3 m for Canadian digital elevation data, 5.2 m for ASTER-GDEM, and 5.5m for ALOS-PALSAR DEM. The RMSEs of the RADARSAT-2 based InSAR DEM and global GTOPO30 are considerably higher than the other DEMs, 24 m and 36 m, respectively. The interferograms of RADARSAT-2 and ALOS-PALSAR data acquired in early winter resulted in higher DEM accuracy compared with the summer image pairs, even with their lower InSAR coherence. This is attributed to the higher importance of perpendicular baseline and height of ambiguity and potentially the significant influence of atmospheric phase delay in DEM generation. We also compared the accuracy of DEMs of different land cover types and their representation of the land-water surface. The results show that vegetated areas of coniferous and broadleaf trees (i.e., white and black spruce, trembling aspen, balsam poplar) seem to be the main sources of error in all DEMs. The river slopes derived from the TanDEM-X, ASTER, and ALOS-PALSAR DEMs show patterns consistent with the river bed slope from our river bathymetry survey. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the performance of those different DEMs in earth surface modeling as well as to improve the quality of high error DEMs such as RADARSAT-2 data in this study. The Slave River Delta in the Northwest Territories of Canada was used as a test case.

In this study, 144 ewes were selected from two large nomadic herds. The ewes were synchronized using progesterone sponges. One day before harvesting the sponges, all ewes were injected intramuscularly with 400 IU of eCG. Then ewes were divided into six groups (12 ewes). In the first herd, 1 (GnRH-1 group), 2 (GnRH-2 group), 5 (GnRH-5 group), 7 (GnRH-7 group) and 12 days (GnRH-12 group) after estrus observation, 25.00 mu g GnRH was injected intramuscularly to the ewes. In the second herd, the ewes were received 500 IU of hCG on days 1 (hCG-1), 2 (hCG-2), 5 (hCG-5), 7 (hCG-7) and 12 (hCG-12). In each herd, a group of 12 ewes received only eCG and progesterone sponges and was considered as control group. The results showed that twinning rate, the number of born lambs, fecundity and prolificacy rate were higher GnRH and hCG received groups on the second day compared to other groups. The serum progesterone concentration was significantly higher in all groups received GnRH and hCG compared to control group. In general, the results showed that GnRH and hCG two days after mating improved different reproductive activities in addition to increasing serum progesterone concentration. On the other hand, hCG had a greater effect on progesterone concentration, the number of born lambs and the fecundity rate compared to GnRH.(c) 2022 Urmia University.

Fragmentation of rock develops high dispersive stress on the failure surface. This reduces overburden stress across the interface, leading to low friction. Fragmentation-induced low friction affects the motion of hard-rock landslides. For example, the Canadian Avalanche Lake landslide requires a basal friction coefficient of 0.1 to explain its motion; New Zealand's Falling Mountain landslide is interpreted as having begun as a blockslide before pervasively fragmenting during runout; and New Zealand's smaller South Ashburton event can be modelled as a blockslide that collapsed near the end of its travel. With low friction, the acceleration is higher than expected from normal rock-on-rock friction. With higher rock-mass velocity, impact waves developed by a fall into water are correspondingly greater.																					0-415-38678-0				2005							257	263																WOS:000235039100038

Predicting thermal reference conditions for USA streams and rivers	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Temperature is a primary driver of the structure and function of stream ecosystems. However, the lack of stream temperature (ST) data for the vast majority of streams and rivers severely compromises our ability to describe patterns of thermal variation among streams, test hypotheses regarding the effects of temperature on macroecological patterns, and assess the effects of altered STs on ecological resources. Our goal was to develop empirical models that could: 1) quantify the effects of stream and watershed alteration (SWA) on STs, and 2) accurately and precisely predict natural (i.e., reference condition) STs in conterminous USA streams and rivers. We modeled 3 ecologically important elements of the thermal regime: mean summer, mean winter, and mean annual ST. To build reference-condition models (RCMs), we used daily mean ST data obtained from several thousand US Geological Survey temperature sites distributed across the conterminous USA and iteratively modeled ST with Random Forests to identify sites in reference condition. We first created a set of dirty models (DMs) that related STs to both natural factors (e.g., climate, watershed area, topography) and measures of SWA, i.e., reservoirs, urbanization, and agriculture. The 3 models performed well (r(2) = 0.84-0.94, residual mean square error [RMSE] = 1.2-2.0 degrees C). For each DM, we used partial dependence plots to identify SWA thresholds below which response in ST was minimal. We then used data from only the sites with upstream SWA below these thresholds to build RCMs with only natural factors as predictors (r(2) = 0.87-0.95, RMSE = 1.1-1.9 degrees C). Use of only reference-quality sites caused RCMs to suffer modest loss of predictor space and spatial coverage, but this loss was associated with parts of ST response curves that were flat and, therefore, not responsive to further variation in predictor space. We then compared predictions made with the RCMs to predictions made with the DMs with SWA set to 0. For most DMs, setting SWAs to 0 resulted in biased estimates of thermal reference condition.

Nararthali wetland, on Buxa Tiger Reserve was studied for three consecutive years (October through March). Forty eight bird species belonging to thirty three genera and twelve families were recorded during study period. Winter visitors were 45.83 % of all species recorded. Nararthali wetland was characterized by high Shannon-Wiener diversity index (1.992 to 2.693) and Margalef's richness index (6.666 to 9.333). Avian density increased with the decrease in day length. Changes in the differences between maximum and minimum temperatures were also observed to influence migration. However, guanotrophy of the wetland system was evident and a good number of migrants along with residents showed significant positive correlations with nutrients like phosphate, nitrate and biologically important divalent cations. As listed in IUCN Red List, one critically endangered species, three vulnerable and four near threatened species recorded from studied site pointed out the importance of such natural wetlands inside forested tracts at the foothills of Himalaya from conservation standpoint.																			0277-5212	1943-6246				FEB	2017	37	1					177	190		10.1007/s13157-016-0851-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-016-0851-7													WOS:000394134600016

Turbulence and stratification in Priest Pot, a productive pond in a sheltered environment	LIMNOLOGY												Priest Pot is an example of the abundant ponds that, collectively, contribute crucially to species diversity. Despite extensive biological study, little has been reported about the physical framework that supports its ecological richness. This article elucidates the physical character of Priest Pot's water column and thus that of similar water bodies. Vertical thermal microstructure profiles were recorded during summer 2003 and analyzed alongside concurrent meteorological data. During summer stratification, the thermal structure appeared to be dominated by surface heat fluxes. Surface wind stress, limited by sheltering vegetation, caused turbulent overturns once a surface mixed layer was present but appeared to contribute little to setting up the thermal structure. Variations in full-depth mean stratification occurred predominantly over seasonal and similar to 5-day time scales, the passage of atmospheric pressure systems being posited as the cause of the latter. In the uppermost similar to 0.5 m, where the stratification varied at subdaily time scales, turbulence was active (sensu Ivey and Imberger 1991) when this layer was mixed, with dissipation values epsilon similar to 10(-8) m(2) s(-3) and vertical diffusivity K-Z = 10(-4) - 10(-6) m(2) s(-1). Where the water column was stratified, turbulence was strongly damped by both buoyancy and viscosity, and K-Z was an order of magnitude smaller. Vertical transport in the mixed layer occurred via many small overturns (Thorpe scale r.m.s. and maximum values were typically 0.02 m and 0.10 m, respectively), and seston were fully mixed through the water column.

In extremely acid mining lakes, benthic filamentous green algae (Zygnemataceae, Chlorophyta) thrive as effective competitors for limited carbon (C). These algae could supply C for microbial-mediated benthic alkalinity generation. However, biomass, productivity and impact of the acidobiontic filamentous green algae at pH <= 3 have not previously been determined. 2. Periphytic filamentous green algae was mapped by harvesting their biomass from 85 1 x 1 m quadrats in mining lake Grunewalder Lauch. Zygogonium ericetorum colonised water depths between 1.6 and 10.5 m covering 88% of total area. Biomass peaked at 5-6 m depth. Total Zygogonium biomass amounted to 72.2 t dry weight for the whole lake (0.94 km(2)), which corresponds to 16.1 t C and the accumulation of primary production from 2.2 years. 3. Growth of Zygogonium is moderately N, C and extremely P deficient, and seriously stressed by high rates of Fe deposition during summer. Consequently, net primary production (NPP) of Zygogonium, calculated from measured photosynthesis versus irradiance characteristics and calculated underwater irradiance (0.13 g C m(-2) year(-1)) and in situ oxygen measurements (7.8 g C m(-2) year(-1)), corresponds to only 0.3% and 18.1% of pelagic NPP. 4. Neither pelagic nor benthic Zygogonium primary production can supply enough C for efficient acidity removal. However, at rates of benthic NPP in summer of 21.4 mg C m(-2) day(-1), Zygogonium contributed 26% of the C equivalents to remove acidity associated with ferric iron, contributing at least seasonally to efficient alkalinity generation.

J	Hu, Y; Lin, YL; Deng, Y; Bao, JW				Hu, Yang; Lin, Yanluan; Deng, Yi; Bao, Jiawei			Summer Extreme Rainfall Over the Middle and Lower Reaches of Yangtze River: Role of Synoptic Patterns in Historical Changes and Future Projections	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												It is one of the major challenges in climate science to project future changes in extreme rainfall. To overcome this challenge, in this study, four typical synoptic patterns (SPs) triggering summer extreme rainfall over the middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River (MLYR) are identified through hierarchical clustering. These typical SPs share common characteristics of intensified Mei-yu trough and Western Pacific Subtropical High but differ in terms of mid-latitudes disturbances, such as an intensified ridge (Cluster 1, Cluster 2) or trough (Cluster 3, Cluster 4) near Lake Baikal (Cluster 1, Cluster 3) or Northeast China (Cluster 2, Cluster 4). The linkage between extreme rainfall and typical SPs is verified at various time scales. The typical SPs associated with extreme rainfall are substantially different from the circulation patterns found on ordinary days, and their frequency is significantly correlated with that of extreme rainfall across the interannual scales. Furthermore, the distinct changes in different typical SPs serve as a "bridge" for understanding the long-term impact of circulation changes on local extreme rainfall, even though the two do not appear to be connected at first sight. Specifically, the circulation changes imply more (less) frequent SP-Cluster 1 (SP-Cluster 3), which tends to produce more extreme rainfall to the south (north) of the Yangtze River within MLYR. To project future changes in extreme rainfall, we utilize a weighting method for the multi-model ensemble based on each model's capability to capture the observed typical SPs. This method effectively narrows the inter-model spread. Extreme rainfall has a huge impact on human society and ecosystem, but the large uncertainty of extreme rainfall simulation hinders the use of climate models in future risk assessment. To reduce the uncertainty, we identify critical physical mechanisms for extreme rainfall formation in the real world and then utilize them as metrics to assess climate models and give more weight to models with better performances. We first identified four types of weather configurations as the critical physical mechanisms for extreme rainfall formation, which are further verified to be closely connected with extreme rainfall at different time scales (i.e., daily, interannual, and several decades). Then, we assess how well each model captures these weather configurations and then generate weighted multi-model ensembles based on the model performances. This method effectively reduces the uncertainty in future projections. This assessment and correction procedure has great potential to provide reliable projections of extreme events in other regions and seasons. The typical synoptic patterns (SPs) triggering summer extreme rainfall (Rx) are differed by mid-latitudes disturbancesThe connection between long-term changes in circulation and Rx emerges when considering various trends of different typical SPsBased on the model's capability to capture the typical SPs, a weighting method could narrow the inter-model spread of future projections					Deng, Yi/K-6664-2012; lin, yanluan/A-6333-2015	Deng, Yi/0000-0003-0659-2767; Hu, Yang/0000-0003-2349-5555; Bao, Jiawei/0000-0002-2127-1817													2169-897X	2169-8996				DEC 27	2023	128	24							e2023JD039608	10.1029/2023JD039608	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023JD039608													WOS:001125932300001

We provide a comprehensive ecosystem analysis from the opportunity to combine organic geochemical and palynological data. Several climatically induced changes to the flora and fauna have been recognised. From 68 to 58 and 48 to 40.5 cal ka BP, relatively depleted delta(13)C(TOC) (-31.3 to -25.0%) and delta(13)C values of mid- and long-chain n-alkanes (-34.3 to -30.2%), as well as high percentages of tropical pollen, indicate a vegetation dominated by subtropical/tropical forest (C-3 plants). An expansion of a mixed C-3/C-4 open grassland between 58 and 48 and particularly after 40.5 cal ka BP mirrors drier climatic conditions, in conjunction with a lowering of atmospheric CO2 concentrations; delta(13)C(TOC) (-24.1 to -16.8%) and delta(13)C values of n-alkyl lipids (-28.9 to -24.1%) are heavier, higher percentages of non-arboreal pollen were observed and the wood/grass lignin index (WGLI) from open pyrolysis (Py-GC) indicates a higher input of grass lignin. Abundant oxidised terrigenous particles that resulted from increased fire activity and/or greater erosion rates are a further hint of enhanced dryness. The clear drop in moisture availability suggests that this site is sensitive in fluctuations of the summer and winter monsoon activity in accordance with other proxy records in south-east Asia.

J	SLOAN, LC				SLOAN, LC			EQUABLE CLIMATES DURING THE EARLY EOCENE - SIGNIFICANCE OF REGIONAL PALEOGEOGRAPHY FOR NORTH-AMERICAN CLIMATE	GEOLOGY												The character of continental-interior paleoclimate at mid-latitudes, especially the aspect of temperature, has been a major source of debate in modeling and paleontologic communities over the past few years. A recent climate modeling study provides new insight into the issue of climatic conditions of early Eocene North America. Model cases with six times the present level of CO2, or with doubled present CO2 and a large lake in western North America, produced results most similar to proxy paleoclimate interpretations. It is significant that the North American continental-interior climate responded as strongly to the existence of the lake as to the atmospheric CO2 level. The large lake deflects the winter-freeze line poleward of the region containing most paleoclimate data site locations, producing above-freezing winter temperatures and providing a possible solution to the minimum-temperature difference that exists between models and data. The effect of the lake upon regional climate is significant and proves to be critical to reproducing the early Eocene climate of North America.																			0091-7613					OCT	1994	22	10					881	884		10.1130/0091-7613(1994)022<0881:ECDTEE>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/0091-7613(1994)022<0881:ECDTEE>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1994PJ58100004

J	SMITH, DW				SMITH, DW			SYNCHRONOUS RESPONSE OF HYDROPHOBIC CHEMICALS IN HERRING GULL EGGS FROM THE GREAT-LAKES	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Herring gull eggs from Great Lakes nesting sites exhibit short-term changes in hydrophobic chemical concentrations that are synchronized within and between Great Lakes. At one Lake Ontario site, for example, short-term deviations from long-term trends for PCBs, DDE, mirex, hexachlorobenzene, and dieldrin in gull eggs tend to correlate significantly with each other, with these chemicals at another site in Lake Ontario, and with gull egg chemicals from Lakes Superior, Huron, and Erie. Similar comparisons made for other Great Lakes are also significantly nonrandom. This synchrony indicates that some large-scale force-here proposed to be weather patterns-controls short-term patterns of hydrophobic chemical concentrations in gull eggs a cross the Great Lakes. Among eight alternative hypotheses considered, the data are least inconsistent with the following mechanism: warm spring weather conducive to phytoplankton growth produces relatively uncontaminated phytoplankton, which in turn produce less contaminated food for the gulls during the critical period of egg yolk formation (and vice versa for cold spring weather).																			0013-936X					MAR	1995	29	3					740	750		10.1021/es00003a023	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es00003a023								22200284					WOS:A1995QJ90800038

Late Glacial temperature and precipitation changes in the lowland Neotropics by tandem measurement of δ18O in biogenic carbonate and gypsum hydration water	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												We applied a new method to reconstruct paleotemperature in the tropics during the last deglaciation by measuring oxygen isotopes of co-occurring gypsum hydration water and biogenic carbonate in sediment cores from two lakes on the Yucatan Peninsula. Oxygen and hydrogen isotope values of interstitial and gypsum hydration water indicate that the crystallization water preserves the isotopic signal of the lake water, and has not undergone post-depositional isotopic exchange with sediment pore water. The estimated lake water delta O-18 is combined with carbonate delta O-18 to calculate paleotemperature. Three paired measurements of 1200-yr-old gypsum and gastropod aragonite from Lake Chichancanab, Mexico, yielded a mean temperature of 26 degrees C (range 23-29.5 degrees C), which is consistent with the mean and range of mean annual temperatures (MAT) in the region today. Paired measurements of ostracods, gastropods, and gypsum hydration water samples were measured in cores from Lake Peten Itza, Guatemala, spanning the Late Glacial and early Holocene period (18.5-10.4 ka). The lowest recorded temperatures occurred at the start of Heinrich Stadial (HS) 1 at 18.5 ka. Inferred temperatures from benthic ostracods ranged from 16 to 20 degrees C during HS 1, which is 6-10 degrees C cooler than MAT in the region today, whereas temperatures derived from shallow-water gastropods were generally warmer (20-25 degrees C), reflecting epilimnetic temperatures. The derived temperatures support previous findings of greater tropical cooling on land in Central America during the Late Glacial than indicated by nearby marine records. Temperature increased in two steps during the last deglaciation. The first occurred during the Bolling-Allerod (B-A; from 14.7 to 13 ka) when temperature rose to 20-24 degrees C towards the end of this period. The second step occurred at 10.4 ka near the beginning of the Holocene when ostracod-inferred temperature rose to 26 degrees C, reflecting modern hypolimnetic temperature set during winter, whereas gastropod-derived temperature attained 30 degrees C, reflecting modern summer epilimnetic temperature.

Reply to Comment on "Anti-phase oscillation of Asian monsoons during the Younger Dryas period: Evidence from peat cellulose δ13C of Hani, Northeast China" By B. Hong, YT Hong, QH Lin, Y. Shibata, M. Uchida, YX Zhu, XT Leng, Y. Wang and CC Cai [Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 297 (2010) 214-222]	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The intensity variation of the East Asian Summer Monsoon dring the Younger Dryas (YD) cold period remains an important scientific issue requiring clarification. In our article published in Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 297 (2010) 214-222, based on the Hani peat cellulose delta C-13 sequence from Northeast China, we have documented the abrupt strengthening of the East Asian Summer Monsoon during that period. Our findings support the occurrence of wet conditions in the north and of dry conditions in the south of the Chinese Mainland, and they indicate behavior in anti-phase with the Indian Ocean Summer Monsoon that weakened during the same period. This result agrees with the previously revealed anti-phase variations of the two monsoons during the ice-rafted debris (IRD) cold events occurring in the North Atlantic Ocean. We have also proposed a theory for the anti-phase variations of the monsoons and for the anomalous distribution of precipitation. We have attributed these events to the occurrence of an El Nifio-likephenomenon in the Equatorial Pacific Ocean during the YD. G. Schettler has argued that "this palaeo-climatic interpretation cannot be substantiated by chemical data from the nearby Lake Sihailongwan or by biomarker studies of the Hani peat. The inferred inverse correlation between the summer monsoon strength in northeast and southern China during the Younger Dryas appears questionable." However, after carefully examining Schettler's [G. Schettler, Comment on "Anti-phase oscillation of Asian monsoons during the Younger Dryas period: Evidence from peat cellulose delta C-13 of Hani, Northeast China" by B. Hong, Y.T. Hong, Q.H. Lin, Y. Shibata, M. Uchida, Y.X. Zhu, X.T. Leng, Y. Wang and C.C Cai [Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 297 (2010) 214-2221, Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, this issue) water chemistry data from Lake Sihailongwan, we find considerable accumulation ratios of biosilica during the YD period that clearly indicates abrupt strengthening of the East Asian Summer Monsoon. We point out that Schettler referred incorrectly to Zhou's research results. Zhou et al. have clearly indicated that elevated n-alkane P-aq values and C-23/C-29 ratios serve to record an especially moist local climate in YD. We also confirm that the influence of an increased relative contribution of Sphagnum species to Hani peat composition on peat cellulose 6 C is negligible. Therefore, our conclusions that, during the VD cold period, the EASM abruptly strengthened and that, moreover, an anti-phase occurred between the two Asian monsoons during the VD period, are both, in fact, substantiated not only by biomarker studies of the Hani peat but also by chemical data from the nearby Lake Sihailongwan. We therefore consider Schettler's statement to be untenable. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Water quality and trophic status of Lake Mariut in Egypt and its drainage water after 8-year diversion	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Water resource management and lake rehabilitation are global interest, to overcome the acute water scarcity facing most urban areas, especially in developing countries. Lake Mariut (LM) is an Egyptian lake that lies south of the Mediterranean Sea, and its management had a great interest in Alexandria's future development and as a part of the environmental sustainability of the Mediterranean basin. LM consists of 4 major basins, namely, main (MB), northwest (NWB), southwest (SWB), and fishery (FB). The MB has deteriorated as it consistently received (sewage and industrial) wastewaters till 2010. This was the date of diversion of the polluting sources as a rehabilitation step. The present work is made after elapsing 8 years from the diversion and aims at monitoring and assessing the status of the water quality not only of MB but also for the other 3 basins too. This was carried out twice, one in cold winter and the other in warm summer. The parameters studied were physico-chemical including water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen/hydrogen sulfide (DO/H2S), salinity, and chlorophyll a besides nutrient salts (nitrogen, N and phosphorus, P compounds). The results revealed that the waters of both MB and SWB basins were depleted in DO to a level difficult to sustain fish life and showed elevated levels of most nutrient salts. Trophically, all the studied basins were in eutrophic-hypereutrophic condition. As a result of pollution source diversion away from MB to be discharged in the downstream part of Umum Drain (UD), the levels of TN and TP entering Mex Bay through UD were slightly higher than the permissible limit and lower than dangerous loading. The applying of principle component analysis (PCA)-based classification approach, for obtaining the WQI on the current study, revealed that the FB, NWB, and SWB2000 showed a relatively good water quality when compared with MB. The depletion in the vital DO is catastrophic and needs urgent solution/s. One of the proposed solutions is the dredging of bottom spoiled organic-rich sediments. This and other suggested solutions are, however, discussed, evaluated, and presented.					; Shaaban, Nashwa/AAB-7708-2022	Shaaban, Nashwa A./0000-0002-1660-5595; 													0167-6369	1573-2959				JUN	2022	194	6							392	10.1007/s10661-022-10009-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-022-10009-8								35478058					WOS:000788323500001

Distribution and Abundance of the Milfoil Weevil, Euhrychiopsis lecontei, in Lake Minnetonka and Relation to Milfoil Harvesting	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC PLANT MANAGEMENT												The milfoil weevil, Euhrychiopsis lecontei (Dietz), native to North America, is it potential biological control agent for Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum L.). The milfoil weevil has been shown to control the plant when sufficient densities are attained and maintained throughout the summer. Mechanical harvesting of Eurasian watermilfoil has been shown to locally reduce the density of weevils in harvested plots, but the effects of broad-scale harvesting have not been evaluated. We determined weevil densities in unharvested plots in early-, mid- and late-summer in nine bays of Lake Minnetonka that had a range of harvest levels. Weevil densities were significantly negitively related to proportion of the bay harvested (r(2) = 0.55. p = 0.02). No relationship between shoreline habitat and weevil density was found. Our suggest that large-scale harvesting is detrimental to weevil populations and that harvesting and chemical control should be limited if the aim is to promote biological control.

Parts of the study occurred during a period of pronounced warming and limited ice cover on Lake Ladoga, which precluded winter surveys of the lake. This limitation notwithstanding, the research provides background climatic and hydrological conditions for the joint Russian-Swiss project "Lake Ladoga - Life under the ice". For both Lakes Onego and Ladoga from 1955 to 2017, air temperature, precipitation, and evaporation data all showed increasing trends, and inflow, outflow, and water levels showed no discernible changes from baseline conditions. Thermal and ice conditions of Lake Onego showed greater sensitivity to climatic changes than corresponding conditions for Lake Ladoga because of the latter's significantly smaller volume and lower heat content. The total ice-cover duration for Lake Onego decreased similar to 20 days during the observation period. Detailed data analysis also revealed key characteristics of the Shuya River discharge into Petrozavodsk Bay, where a major part of the fieldwork occurred. River discharge into Lakes Ladoga and Onego increased in the winter. These processes collectively can change the hydrochemical conditions, water quality, and habitat.

Early settlement activities are marked by qualitative changes in the flora and small increases in microfossil flux. Events associated with the Ambrosia horizon produced a rapid transition from assemblages characteristic of oligotrophic environments to those characteristic of eutrophic waters and a large increase in microfossil flux. This was followed by a period of decreasing siliceous microfossil flux and reestablishment of less eutrophic species .apprx. 1853-1861. Minimum siliceous algal microfossil flux and highly atypical assemblages occurred in the period .apprx. 1879-1888, which corresponds to the period of intensive mining activities in the Bay of Quinte watershed. Maximum flux of siliceous microfossils occurred .apprx. 1900 and declined thereafter, although composition of assemblages deposited indicates increasing eutrophy and displacement of summer-blooming species. This is interpreted as evidence of beginning of summer silica limitation.

This study examined the seasonal dynamics of five heavy metals such as lead (Pb), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), chromium (Cr) and cadmium (Cd) in water, sediment, and the muscle tissue of Cyprinus carpio collected from the Chashma Barrage on the Indus River, Pakistan. In parallel, key water quality parameters including temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen (DO) were monitored across four seasons to evaluate their impact on metal mobility and bioaccumulation. The results showed pronounced seasonal fluctuations, with summer characterized by the highest water temperature (38.22 degrees C) and lowest DO levels (4.72 mg/L), conditions that promote metal solubility and biological uptake. Concentrations of Pb and Cd in fish muscle peaked during the summer, while sediments also exhibited elevated metal levels during periods of increased runoff. Statistical analyses, including correlation and cluster methods, revealed strong associations between water quality variables and metal distribution. These findings underscore the role of seasonal environmental changes in influencing contaminant behavior and highlight the importance of continuous monitoring and targeted regulatory strategies to mitigate heavy metal pollution, protect freshwater biodiversity and ensure public health.

The subsurface maxima of bacterial abundance and chlorophyll concentration were recorded at the same depth, whereas the vertical distribution of heterotrophic nanoflagellates was the inverse of those of bacteria and picophytoplankton. Release of extracellular organic carbon (EOC) from phytoplankton was estimated by the (NaHCO3)-C-14 method as 2.4 mugCl(-1) day(-1). Bacterial production (4.3mugCl(-1)day(-1)), estimated in a bottle incubation experiment using size-fractionated water samples, exceeded the EOC released. Thus, other supplying sources of organic matter are needed for the bacterial production. Grazing (2.6 mugCl(-1)day(-1)) was also estimated in the experiment and accounted for 60% of the bacterial production.

These lacustrine data are compared with historical chronicles, geomorphological features and glaciological studies in this region of the western Alps and they allow the documentation of recent environmental changes. The specific geometry of high-amplitude reflections in the uppermost seismic unit, the lithology of short cores and the available limnological data in the lake suggest that elastic particles eroded by the glaciers and transported in suspension by glacial melt waters in early summer essentially develop homopycnal flood events in the lake. A conceptual model linking fluctuations of glacier equilibrium line altitudes in the catchment area with sedimentary facies retrieved in the lake basin is proposed. This approach allows reconstructing continuous glacier fluctuations since AD1820-1850 and suggests several phases of glacier fluctuations during the Little Ice Age (LIA). These reconstructions are based on changes in lacustrine sediment laminations, density, magnetic susceptibility, reflectance spectra, organic matter and Arsenic content. The age-depth model of short sediment cores is provided by Pb-210, 117CS and Am-241 radionuclide dating. This chronology is further supported by identifying in lacustrine sediments the impact of (i) the nearby M 5.3 Corren on earthquake in AD 1962, (ii) the development of the ski resort at high-altitude close to the lake and (iii) the last advance of glaciers during the LIA in AD1820-1850 and the following phase of glacier retreat observed in the alpine region at the end of the LIA in AD 1880. Frequent sandy layers enriched in organic matter and associated with fluctuations in the Arsenic concentrations may result from hydraulic remobilisation of Middle Age mine tailings at the lake shore by snow melt or heavy rain fall events during the LIA.

The presence of significant amounts of extra-atmospheric gases (CO2 and CH4), which increase their concentrations with depth, is also recognized. These chemical features, mimicking those commonly shown by volcanic lakes fed by hydrothermal-magmatic reservoirs, are consistent with those of mineral springs emerging in the study area whose chemistry is produced by the interaction of meteoric-derived waters with Mesozoic carbonates and Triassic evaporites. Although the lake has a pronounced thermocline, water chemistry does not show significant changes along the vertical profile. Lake water balance calculations demonstrate that Lake Accesa has >90% of its water supply from sublacustrine springs whose subterranean pathways are controlled by the local structural assessment that likely determined the sinking event, the resulting funnel-shape being then filled by the Accesa waters. Such a huge water inflow from the lake bottom (similar to 9.10(6) m(3) yr(-1)) feeds the lake effluent (Bruna River) and promotes the formation of water currents, which are able to prevent the establishment of a vertical density gradient. Consequently, a continuous mixing along the whole vertical water column is established. Changes of the drainage system by the deep-originated waters in the nearby former mining district have strongly affected the outflow rates of the local mineral springs; thus, future intervention associated with the ongoing remediation activities should carefully be evaluated to preserve the peculiar chemical features of Lake Accesa.

Diel variation in summer habitat use, feeding periodicity, and diet of subyearling Atlantic salmon in the Salmon River Basin, New York	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The habitat use, diet composition, and feeding periodicity of subyearling Atlantic salmon (Salmo solar) was examined during both day and night periods during summer in tributaries of Lake Ontario. The amount of cover used was the major habitat variable that differed between day and night periods in both streams. At night subyearling Atlantic salmon were associated with significantly less cover than during the day. Principal Component Analysis showed that habitat selection of subyearling Atlantic salmon was more pronounced during the day in both streams and that salmon in Orwell Brook exhibited more diel variability in habitat use than salmon in Trout Brook. Subyearling salmon fed primarily from the benthic substrate on baetids, chironomids, and leptocerids. There was a substantial amount of diel variation in diet composition with peak feeding occurring from 0400 h to 0800 h on July 21-22, 2008.

Across the landscape, reservoirs have diverse origins, functions, and operational strategies. In temperate environments, winter water-level drawdown is a common operational practice in reservoirs but the long-term impacts of this hydrological modification has not been extensively studied. We paired a comparative, pre-dam-to-contemporary study (i.e. a top-bottom design) of 12 reservoirs with a detailed paleolimnological study of a focal lake to generate quantitative insights into the relative effect of hydrological changes vs. landscape and climatic drivers on water quality. The focal reservoir, Grand Lac Saint-Francois, is of relatively similar morphometry, geography, and limnology to our other sites, and has experienced annual winter water-level drawdown of similar to 5m since it was dammed approximately 100years ago. Based on our top-bottom analysis, we did not find strong correlations between long-term changes in water quality (i.e. diatom-inferred TP estimates) and winter water-level drawdown amplitudes. Instead, reservoir morphometry and watershed characteristics (i.e. geography, maximum depth, and cropland areas) appeared to be stronger drivers of trends across the region. From the detailed paleolimnological analysis, we found that sedimentary pigments and DI-TP concentrations significantly increased over the last century based on Mann-Kendall trend analyses. Breakpoint analyses showed that changes in biological-proxy trends, as well as the sedimentology (i.e. lithology and accumulations rates), coincided with dam construction and the onset of water level regulation. However, given the high variability in metrics and the extent of water level monitoring records, we were unable to quantitatively associate the impacts of drawdown with water quality trends at Grand Lac Saint-Francois. Conversely, we did find that watershed nutrient surpluses from livestock farming, and warming temperatures were significant explanatory variables of water quality metrics.

Can reductions in water residence time be used to disrupt seasonal stratification and control internal loading in a eutrophic monomictic lake?	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Anthropogenic eutrophication caused by excess loading of nutrients, especially phosphorus (P), from catchments is a major cause of lake water quality degradation. The release of P from bed sediments to the water column, termed internal loading, can exceed catchment P load in eutrophic lakes, especially those that stratify during warm summer periods. Managing internal P loading is challenging, and although a range of approaches have been implemented, long-term success is often limited, requiring lake-specific solutions. Here, we assess the manipulation of lake residence time to inhibit internal loading in Elterwater, a shallow stratifying lake in the English Lake District, UK. Since 2016, additional inflowing water has been diverted into the inner basin of Elterwater to reduce its water residence time, with the intention of limiting the length of the stratified period and reducing internal loading. Combining eight years of field data in a Before-After-Control-Impact study with process-based hydrodynamic modelling enabled the quantification of the residence time intervention effects on stratification length, water column stability, and concentrations of chlorophyll a and P. Annual water residence time was reduced during the study period by around 40% (4.9 days). Despite this change, the lake continued to stratify and developed hypolimnetic anoxia. As a result, there was little significant change in phosphorus (as total or soluble reactive phosphorus) or chlorophyll a concentrations. Summer stratification length was 2 days shorter and 7% less stable with the intervention. Our results suggest that the change to water residence time in Elterwater was insufficient to induce large enough physical changes to improve water quality. However, the minor physical changes suggest the management measure had some impact and that larger changes in water residence time may have the potential to induce reductions in internal loading. Future assessments of management requirements should combine multi-year observations and physical lake modelling to provide improved understanding of the intervention effect size required to alter the physical structure of the lake, leading to increased hypolimnetic oxygen and reduced potential for internal loading.

Effects of Temperature Forcing Provenance and Extrapolation on the Performance of an Empirical Glacier-Melt Model	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Temperature-index models are popular tools for glacier melt-modeling due to their minimal data requirements and generally favorable performance. We examine the effects of temperature forcing provenance and extrapolation on the performance of one such model applied to a small glacier in the Saint Elias Mountains of northwestern Canada. The model is forced with air temperatures recorded (a) on two glaciers, (b) at two nearby ice-free locations, and (c) by two low-elevation valley stations. We extrapolate these temperatures using constant lapse rates and assess model performance by comparing measured and modeled cumulative summer ablation at a network of stakes over five melt seasons. When the model is calibrated individually for each temperature forcing and lapse rate, the variation in model performance is modest relative to inter-annual variations associated with melt-season conditions and calibration data quality. Despite <30% variation in estimated summer ablation arising from the combined influences of temperature forcing and lapse rate, the resulting variations in estimated annual mass balance can be significant (>100% in some cases). While model parameters calibrated in this way suffer from error compensation and exhibit equifinality, the lapse rates associated with minimum model error exhibit inter-annual variation that can be related to prevailing meteorological conditions. When the model is instead calibrated at the point scale without employing a lapse rate, and the resulting parameters are paired with an arbitrary temperature forcing, lapse rates associated with minimum model error vary widely between forcing types and years. Low-elevation stations distal from the study site sometimes outperform the calibration station, but the prescribed lapse rate becomes critical in this case. With either calibration method, lapse rates that minimize model error for the valley stations are generally steeper than the measured environmental lapse rates.

Genomic and morphological characterization of a new Thiothrix species from a sulfide hot spring of the Zmeinaya bay (Northern Baikal, Russia)	ANTONIE VAN LEEUWENHOEK INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENERAL AND MOLECULAR MICROBIOLOGY												A survey for bacteria of the genus Thiothrix indicated that they inhabited the area where the water of the Zmeiny geothermal spring (northern basin of Lake Baikal, Russia) mixed with the lake water. In the coastal zone of the lake oxygen (8.25 g/L) and hydrogen sulfide (up to 1 mg/L) were simultaneously present at sites of massive growth of these particular Thiothrix bacteria. Based on the analysis of the morphological characteristics and sequence of individual genes (16S rRNA, rpoB and tilS), we could not attribute the Thiothrix from Lake Baikal to any of the known species of this genus. To determine metabolic capabilities and phylogenetic position of the Thiothrix sp. from Lake Baikal, we analyzed their whole genome. Like all members of this genus, the bacteria from Lake Baikal were capable of organo-heterotrophic, chemolithoheterotrophic, and chemolithoautotrophic growth and differed from its closest relatives in the spectrum of nitrogen and sulfur cycle genes as well as in the indices of average nucleotide identity (ANI < 75-94%), amino acid identity (AAI < 94%) and in silico DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH < 17-57%), which were below the boundary of interspecies differences, allowing us to identify them as novel candidate species.					; Bukin, Sergei/J-3577-2018; Zemskaya, Tamara/N-2647-2017; Bukin, Yurij/AAQ-1698-2020; Chernitsyna, Svetlana/J-3928-2018	Chernitsyna, Svetlana/0000-0003-3691-0498; Bukin, Yurij/0000-0002-4534-3846; Zemskaya, Tamara/0000-0002-3575-0472; 													0003-6072	1572-9699				DEC	2024	117	1							23	10.1007/s10482-023-01918-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10482-023-01918-w								38217803					WOS:001142404700001

Extremely high surface sediment available P concentrations in the Fishing Lakes of southern Saskatchewan [Canada] were related to P loading from municipal and other cultural sources. Mean available P concentrations in surface sediments from the Fishing Lakes are higher than those found in other prairie lakes and in most other Canadian lakes. Sediment cores show that presettlement concentrations of available P in the Fishing Lakes are higher than those occurring today in surface sediments from culturally eutrophied lakes, such as Lake Erie, elsewhere in Canada. Free Fe is concentrated in the surface 10-15 cm of sediment cores from the Fishing Lakes and Lake Erie. Such a distribution, when coupled to low free Fe/available P ratios, reflects conditions favorable for P regeneration when anoxic conditions develop under winter ice cover. For the winter of 1976-1977, a mean sediment P release rate of 8.6 mg/m2 per day was calculated for the Fishing Lakes.																			0047-2425	1537-2537					1978	7	1					99	106		10.2134/jeq1978.00472425000700010020x	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq1978.00472425000700010020x													WOS:A1978EM10500019
J	Barbiero, RP; Tuchman, ML				Barbiero, RP; Tuchman, ML			The deep chlorophyll maximum in Lake Superior	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Summer surveys conducted on Lake Superior from 1996-2001 indicated that a deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) is a common feature of the offshore waters. The DCM was usually observed in the upper hypolimnion between 23 and 35 m, a region lacking a pronounced density gradient. Chlorophyll a concentrations in the DCM were typically 1.5-2.5 (median = 2.0) times epilinmetic concentrations, although these were associated with minimal or no increases in particulate organic carbon concentrations. Seston carbon:phosphorus ratios were consistently lower in the DCM than in the epilimnion, indicating increased phosphorus content of DCM phytoplankton. This could have resulted from either improved nutrient conditions or light limitation at depth. A phosphorus-rich phytoplankton community at depth could serve as a resource for the large, deep-living calanoid copepods that constitute the majority of summer zooplankton biomass. The phytoplankton communities at the level of the DCM were taxonomically distinguishable from those in the epilimnion, with the most notable difference being a relative reduction in the abundance of Cyclotella species in the DCM.																			0380-1330						2004	30			1			256	268		10.1016/S0380-1330(04)70390-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(04)70390-1													WOS:000227991500018
J	Jones, JR; Knowlton, MF				Jones, JR; Knowlton, MF			Suspended solids in Missouri reservoirs in relation to catchment features and internal processes	WATER RESEARCH												Mean total suspended solids (TSS), in 135 Missouri reservoirs range from 1.2 to 47 mg/l. The volatile (VSS) and nonvolatile (NVSS) fractions range from 0.6 to 9.6 mg/l and 0.5 to 37 mg/l, respectively. %NVSS is the larger fraction and declines through summer as %VSS increases. Suspended solids (particularly VSS) correlate with metrics of lake trophic state and are positively related with the proportion of cropland (%C, r = 0.69-0.74) in their catchments, negatively related with forest cover (r = -0.54 to -0.56), and weakly related with grassland (r < 0.31). Regressions including %C with dam height (representing morphometry) and flushing rate (representing hydrology), explain similar to 70% of cross-system variation in TSS and 67% in VSS. Dam height and %C explain 57% of variation in NVSS. Residual analysis shows statewide models under-predict suspended solids in urban reservoirs. Effects of catchment features on summer TSS largely reflect internal plankton growth mediated by influent nutrients (affecting VSS) over direct sediment input (affecting NVSS). (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Adopting foraging behaviours to minimise predation risk may also lead to a decline in condition, and hence fecundity. Predictions of three hypotheses (condition constraint hypothesis, predator-avoidance constraint hypothesis, predation-sensitive foraging (PSF) hypothesis) were tested by comparing changes in the survival and condition of snowshoe hares on four experimental areas in winter during a cyclic peak and decline (1989-1993) near Kluane Lake, Yukon, Canada, where (i) predation risk was reduced by excluding terrestrial predators (FENCE), (ii) food supply was supplemented with rabbit chow ad libitum (FOOD), (iii) these two treatments were combined (FENCE+FOOD), and (iv) an unmanipulated CONTROL was used. Different patterns of survival and changes in body mass were observed in the presence and absence of terrestrial predators. On the CONTROL area, female body mass and fecundity declined, even though sufficient winter forage was apparently available in all years. A similar decrease in body mass was observed on the FOOD treatment, but only during the third year of the population decline. In contrast, female body mass remained high throughout the decline in the absence of terrestrial predators in the FENCE+FOOD and FENCE treatments. Winter survival declined on CONTROL and FENCE areas during the first year of the population decline (1991), but remained higher on FOOD until 1992 and FENCE+FOOD until 1993. These results generally supported the PSF hypothesis where terrestrial predators were present (CONTROL and FOOD grids). Where terrestrial predators were absent (FENCE and FENCE+FOOD), the results supported the alternative condition constraint hypothesis. The evidence suggests that a cascade of sublethal behavioural and physiological effects associated with increased predation risk contribute to the population decline and delayed recovery of cyclic low-phase populations of snowshoe hares.

J	Laybourn-Parry, J; Pearce, D				Laybourn-Parry, Johanna; Pearce, David			Heterotrophic bacteria in Antarctic lacustrine and glacial environments	POLAR BIOLOGY												Antarctica has the greatest diversity of lakes types on the planet including freshwater, brackish, saline and hypersaline systems, epishelf lakes, ice shelf lakes and lakes and cryoconite holes on glacier surfaces. Beneath the continental ice sheet, there are hundreds of subglacial lakes. These systems are dominated by microbial food webs, with few or no metazoans. They are subject to continuous cold, low annual levels of photosynthetically active radiation and little or no allochthonous nutrient inputs from their catchments. Subglacial lakes function in darkness. Heterotrophic bacteria are a conspicuous and important component of the simple truncated food webs present. Bacterial abundance and production vary between freshwater and saline lakes, the latter being more productive. The bacterioplankton functions throughout the year, even in the darkness of winter when primary production is curtailed. In more extreme glacial habitats, biomass is even lower with low rates of production during the annual melt season. Inter-annual variation appears to be a characteristic of bacterial production in lakes. The factors that control production appear to be phosphorus limitation and grazing by heterotrophic and mixotrophic flagellate protozoa. The evidence suggests high rates of viral infection in bacteria and consequent viral lysis, resulting in significant carbon recycling, which undoubtedly supports bacterial growth in winter. The biodiversity of lacustrine Antarctic heterotrophic bacteria is still relatively poorly researched. However, most of the main phyla are represented and some patterns are beginning to emerge. One of the major problems is that data for heterotrophic bacteria are confined to a few regions served by well-resourced research stations, such as the McMurdo Dry Valleys, the Vestfold Hills and Signy Island. A more holistic multidisciplinary approach is needed to provide a detailed understanding of the functioning, biodiversity and evolution of these communities. This is particularly important as Antarctic lakes are regarded as sentinels of climate change.

The climatic significance of these pine phases has been interpreted in different ways. Using a pollen climate inference model, we quantified the climate changes and consistently found that mean summer precipitation (P-JJA) increased (0.5-0.9 min/day) and mean November temperature increased (2.0-3.0 degrees C) during pine phases coeval with Heinrich events and the Younger Dryas. Marine sea surface temperature records indicate that potential sources for these moisture and heat anomalies are in the Gulf of Mexico and the western tropical Atlantic. We explain this low latitude warming by an increased Loop Current facilitated by persistence of the Atlantic Warm Pool during summer. This hypothesis is supported by a climate model sensitivity analysis. A positive heat anomaly in the Gulf of Mexico and equatorial Atlantic best approximates the pollen-inferred climate reconstructions from Lake Tulane during the (stadials around) Heinrich events and the Younger Dryas.					de Boer, Hugo/M-3973-2013; Grimm, Eric/G-3011-2013; Finsinger, Walter/A-7937-2011; Dekker, Stefan/F-5581-2013; Donders, Timme/J-5044-2012; Wagner-Cremer, Friederike/B-4225-2009; Reichart, Gert-Jan/N-6308-2018	Dekker, Stefan/0000-0001-7764-2464; Wagner-Cremer, Friederike/0000-0002-8119-3558; Finsinger, Walter/0000-0002-8297-0574; Donders, Timme/0000-0003-4698-3463; Reichart, Gert-Jan/0000-0002-7256-2243													0930-7575	1432-0894				JAN	2011	36	1-2					109	118		10.1007/s00382-009-0702-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-009-0702-9													WOS:000286492300007

The applied floating observation system made it possible to monitor the evaporation process far away from shore, which reduces impacts of advection and other inferences from the terrestrial surroundings. The measured data therefore reflect the pure nature of the water-atmosphere-interaction that takes place over an extensive large open water surface. The daily evaporation rates were only half to two-thirds of the FAO grass-reference evapotranspiration, which is in conflict with many textbooks those equate the evaporation of open water surfaces with the potential evaporation, which is even higher than the FAO grass-reference evapotranspiration. Measurement uncertainties and in particular the energy-balance-closure-gap in the eddy-covariance data cannot explain this discrepancy. On the contrary, much lower evaporation rates need to be assumed for open-water surfaces. Before this background, different model approaches were reviewed and a modified Dalton approach was selected for accompanying model investigations. Several parameterizations found in the scientific literature were tested together with parameterizations derived from station data. The suitability of the Dalton approach in general and the parameter sets used were evaluated against the background of unavoidable measurement uncertainties and measurement tolerances in both the input data and the reference data. The different parameterizations of the model approach resulted in significantly varying modelling qualities and performances. At the same time, however, it was also shown that the effects of seemingly insignificant measurement uncertainties in the input data accumulate to considerable amounts, leading to significant uncertainties that must be considered in water balance investigations and issues of water resource management in order to avoid misjudgements.					; Koschorreck, Matthias/E-1251-2015; Aurich, Patrick/NFS-4887-2025; Mauder, Matthias/A-7070-2013	Aurich, Patrick/0000-0003-2598-9305; Koschorreck, Matthias/0000-0002-4393-3500; Mauder, Matthias/0000-0002-8789-163X; Spank, Uwe/0000-0003-1929-7353; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				APR	2025	651								132530	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.132530	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.132530		DEC 2024											WOS:001395007500001

As a result, reconstructing the precise timing, magnitude, and drivers of Holocene climate change remains challenging, requiring more detailed data and advanced statistical methods. In this study, we present a quantitative reconstruction of Holocene hydroclimate changes in northeastern China through a data-model fusion approach. By integrating water chemistry data from ostracod shells in a closed-basin lake with a hydrological balance model, we estimate growing-season temperature anomalies and relative lake-level changes during the Holocene. Our results highlight a mid-Holocene hydrological peak corresponding to the Holocene Thermal Maximum in the region. This peak lagged behind the early-Holocene summer insolation maximum, likely due to the influence of remnant ice sheets in the Northern Hemisphere. A comparison of our relative lake-level record with data of regional pollen-based precipitation reconstructions and TraCE-21 k modeling reveals a consistent pattern of increased monsoonal rainfall during the middle Holocene, followed by a steady decline after 5 kyr BP, reflecting a weakening of the East Asian summer monsoon. Additionally, our EOF analyses identify an early-Holocene tripolar precipitation pattern, which reversed in the middle Holocene, driven by shifts in atmospheric circulation. These findings advance our understanding of Holocene climate variability and offer insights for future climate predictions in monsoonal regions.																			0031-0182	1872-616X				MAY 15	2025	666								112833	10.1016/j.palaeo.2025.112833	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2025.112833		FEB 2025											WOS:001436469000001
J	Dolan, W; Pavelsky, TM; Yang, X				Dolan, Wayana; Pavelsky, Tamlin M.; Yang, Xiao			Functional Lake-to-Channel Connectivity Impacts Lake Ice in the Colville Delta, Alaska	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												Within Arctic deltas, surficial hydrologic connectivity of lakes to nearby river channels influences physical processes like sediment transport and ice phenology as well as biogeochemical processes such as photochemistry. As the Arctic hydrologic cycle is impacted by climate change, it is important to quantify temporal variability in connectivity. However, current connectivity detection methods are either spatially limited due to data availability constraints or have been applied at only a single time. Additionally, the relationship between connectivity and lake ice is still poorly quantified. In this study, we present a multitemporal classification of functional lake connectivity in the Colville River Delta, Alaska. We introduce a connectivity detection algorithm based on remote sensing of high sediment river water recharge that is expandable to other high sediment Arctic deltas. We compare results to three existing data sets, producing 64.4%, 75.8%, and 85.2% lake classification accuracy. Mismatches between the data sets are often due to inconsistencies in methodology or definition of connectivity. Connectivity varies temporally in about 10% of studied lakes and correlates strongly with discharge and lake elevation, supporting the idea that future changes in discharge will be a driver of changes in connectivity. Highly connected lakes start and end ice break up an average of 26 and 17 days earlier, respectively, compared to lakes that are poorly connected. Because spring and summer ice conditions drive Arctic lake photochemistry processes, our research suggests that surface connectivity is an important parameter to consider when studying biogeochemistry of Arctic delta lakes. Plain Language Summary Arctic deltas contain a complex tapestry of channels and lakes. Lakes can be isolated from channels or connected to channels-either by feeder channels, other lakes, or by water movement over land during flooding. This connectivity is important because it impacts the movement of sediment, light penetration through water, and when lake ice forms and disappears. While we anticipate future changes in connectivity due to climate change, our ability to monitor connectivity is limited to individual deltas or single instances in time. Additionally, the relationship between lake ice and connectivity is poorly understood. In this study, we used a method based on satellite observations of sediment in water to examine lake connectivity variations within the Colville River Delta, Alaska. We found that most lakes stay connected or disconnected, but that about 10% of lakes have variable connectivity. These lakes are more likely to be connected when river discharge is high. Additionally, lake ice tends to break up earlier and last for a shorter period of time in connected lakes. Because lake ice conditions drive chemical interaction between sunlight and organic compounds in the water, connectivity is important to consider when studying the biology and chemistry of Arctic delta lakes. Key Points We have developed an algorithm using optical properties of lakes and channels to detect lake-to-channel connectivity in an Arctic delta We show that this algorithm can be used to detect lakes where functional connectivity varies based on maximum summer discharge Differences in functional connectivity drive lake ice phenology, which is likely important for photochemical processes						Dolan, Wayana/0000-0001-8405-4302													2169-9003	2169-9011				DEC	2021	126	12							e2021JF006362	10.1029/2021JF006362	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021JF006362													WOS:000757163400019

S.; Manasypov, R. M.			Flood zone biogeochemistry of the Ob River middle course	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												The flood zone of the Ob River, the largest (in watershed area) river of the Arctic Ocean basin, is tens of km wide and, after the Amazon's Varzea, is the world's second largest flooding territory. To better understand the biogeochemistry of the Ob River and adjacent surface waters, we studied, in May and July 2014, the dissolved and colloidal organic carbon and trace metals in small rivers, lakes, and flooded water bodies connected and disconnected with the mainstream as well as the Ob River itself. All major and trace elements were distributed among two major categories depending on their pattern of dependence on the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration. Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), Na, Mg, Ca, sulfate, Sr, Mo, Sb and U exhibited a general decrease in concentration with the increase of the [DOC]. The lowest concentration of these elements was observed in DOC-rich humic, acidic (4.9 <= pH <= 6.1) upland lakes fed by surrounding bogs. These elements marked the influence of underground feeding in July during summer baseflow, which was most visible in flood lakes in the Ob riparian zone and the Ob River itself. In May, the flood lakes were statistically similar to the Ob River. The elevated concentration of DOC (up to 60 mg/L) in the upland lakes was not correlated with groundwater-related elements, suggesting a lack of significant groundwater feeding in these lakes. In contrast, insoluble, usually low mobile elements (Al, Fe, other trivalent hydrolysates, Ti, Zr, Hf) and some metals (Cr, Zn, Ni, Pb) demonstrated a steady increase in concentration with increasing DOC, with the lowest values observed in the Ob River and the highest values observed in small tributaries and organic-rich upland lakes in July. It follows that these elements are limited by their main carriers - organic and organo-ferric colloids, rather than by the availability of the source, peat and mineral soil or plant litter. While for the majority of non-colloidal, groundwater-fed elements with high mobility (DIC, Na, Mg, Ca, K, Sr...) the small tributaries can be used as representatives of the Ob main stream, this is not the case for low mobility "insoluble" elements, such as Fe, Al, trivalent and tetravalent hydrolysates, and metal micronutrients (Cu, Zn, and Mn). The low soluble elements and divalent metals exhibited a much lower concentration in the river mainstream compared to that in the flood lakes, upland lakes and small rivers. This difference is significantly more pronounced in the baseflow in July compared to the spring flood in May. Presumably, autochthonous processes, such as the photo-oxidation and bio-oxidation of organo-ferric colloids and phytoplankton uptake are capable decreasing the concentration of these elements in the river mainstream.

Phytoplankton responded strongly to N and N + P, but not to P, with increased cell density, chlorophyll a, and photosynthesis and shifts in composition from chrysophytes to cyanophytes, chlorophytes, and diatoms. Zooplankton density and biomass were unaltered despite the additional phytoplankton stock, probably as the result of poor food quality. In the late summer, algae on tiles responded to N and N + P additions with greater chlorophyll a and increases in cyanophyte and chlorophyte density. Algae on sediment dominated whole-enclosure algal biomass but were spatially variable and responded insignificantly to nutrients. Consequently, N controlled productivity and community composition of phytoplankton and algae on hard substrates but had less impact on ecosystem algal biomass because of the large pool of nutrient-sufficient sediment algae. Phytoplankton were more photosynthetically efficient than the benthos, however, such that primary productivity did shift more toward the water column.

J	Laane, RWPM; Sonneveldt, HLA; Van der Weyden, AJ; Loch, JPG; Groeneveld, G				Laane, RWPM; Sonneveldt, HLA; Van der Weyden, AJ; Loch, JPG; Groeneveld, G			Trends in the spatial and temporal distribution of metals (Cd, Cu, Zn and Pb) and organic compounds (PCBs and PAHs) in Dutch coastal zone sediments from 1981 to 1996: A model case study for Cd and PCBs	JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH												The spatial and temporal distribution of trace metals (Cd, Pb, Zn and Cu), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) was studied to assess trends in the sediment of the Dutch coastal zone (<63-mu m fraction) from 1981 to 1996. In general, the distributions showed a distinct zonation, with highest concentrations close to the coast near freshwater outlets and where dredged material had been dumped. Over time, the zone with high concentrations narrowed and moved towards the coast. The median of the percentage of the <63-mu m fraction in the surface sediments did not change significantly in the Dutch coastal zone between 1981 and 1996. In that period, the median concentrations of Cd, Cu, Zn and Pb fell by 71, 38, 49 and 53%, respectively, in the area close to the coast (<20 km) north of the outlet of the Rhine. South of this outlet the median Cd, Cu and Zn concentrations fell by 45, 29 and 17%, respectively, and in the open sea area (>20 km offshore) the median concentrations for Cu and Zn fell by 35 and 18%, respectively. The largest reduction (80%) of the median concentration of PCBs occurred in the surface sediment in the open sea area (>20 km offshore) between 1986 and 1996. During this period the median PCBs concentration fell by nearly 70% close to the coast. The median PAH concentration fell by only 26% north of the outlet of the Rhine (<20 km from the coast) between 1986 and 1996. In the other areas there was no significant change. Possible reasons are that the main sources of PAHs are in the North Sea itself and that the load of PAHs from dredged material dumped in the Dutch coastal zone increased during the period studied. The reduction of the concentrations of metals and organic micropollutants in the surface sediments of the Dutch coastal zone is explained by a conservative physical mixing model, in which the previously polluted silt fraction in the surface sediments is replaced. by less polluted suspended matter. There is a time lag of several years between the trend in the load of Cd and PCBs and the observed field concentration. The half life of the silt fraction and associated substances in the surface sediments is 1.9. Taking the uncertainties in the loads into account, the calculated surface sediment concentrations for Cd and PCBs agree fairly well with the field measurements. It is concluded that there are three main reasons for the decline in the metal, PCB and PAH concentrations in the highly dynamic surface sediments of the Dutch coastal zone: (1) the decrease in the load from various sources; (2) the sedimentation and mixing of less polluted suspended matter into the active sediment layer; and (3) the washing out of previously deposited more heavily polluted particles.

In eutrophic Lake Hiidenvesi, we studied the possibility that water quality indirectly affects mysids by forcing them to habitats where they are vulnerable to fish predation. Mysis relicta was absent from basins that did not stratify (water depth < 10 m). In the deep basin, as the summer progressed, M. relicta was concentrated in the deepest areas and moved upward in the water column as water temperature increased and dissolved oxygen decreased. Between mid-August and mid-September, only a thin water layer was habitable; the rest had either intolerably low oxygen concentration or too high of a temperature. M. relicta abundance decreased from 2.72 x 10(8) individuals on 3 June to 3.72 x 10(6) individuals on 19 October, with the sharpest decrease taking place in August. At the same time, the vertical distribution of smelts shifted downward and the percentage of mysids in the stomach contents of smelts increased steeply. The consumption rate by smelts was high enough to explain the collapse of the M. relicta population; during 18 August-2 September, smelts consumed 5.6 times the mysid production. The results suggested that unfavorable physicochemical conditions did not directly cause the drastic reduction of the population abundance of M. relicta but indirectly facilitated predation by smelts, which was the final cause of the collapse. The high predation rate by smelts was probably accelerated by the emergence of chaoborid larvae, which were important food items for smelts in early summer.
