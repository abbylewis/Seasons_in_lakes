J	PADISAK, J; TOTH, LG				PADISAK, J; TOTH, LG			SOME ASPECTS OF THE ECOLOGY OF SUBDOMINANT GREEN-ALGAE IN A LARGE, NUTRIENT LIMITED SHALLOW LAKE (BALATON, HUNGARY)	ARCHIV FUR PROTISTENKUNDE					INTERNATIONAL SYMP ON BIOLOGY AND TAXONOMY OF GREEN ALGAE	JUN 25-29, 1990	SMOLENICE, CZECHOSLOVAKIA	SLOVAK ACAD SCI				In long-term (1933-1989) and seasonal analyses green algae have never been dominants in Lake Balaton; their contribution to phytoplankton biomass has been oscillating around 10%. Parallel with the eutrophication of the lake a shift from planktonic desmids to coccal green algae was observed within the above 10%. On the other hand, their species number can exceed the 50% of the number of all species that can be found in seasonal studies. Two basically different seasonal patterns of green algal growth were found. "Type-B" species (most of the chlorococcal green algae) are very rare in the phytoplankton. Those that occur in larger amounts cannot be characterised with regular growing patterns, and their average population density changes exceed the one doubling/halving per day. No case has been known in Lake Balaton in which they significantly participated in some competitive equilibrium state. By comparing these results with those derived from chemostat experiments and those of other studies, the paper concludes that the existence of the Type-B species has been rather a question of many independent events (spatially and temporally always renewing nutrient rich microenvironments) than that of the "community average", and that their ecology might be a special case when competition theory has been useless. The extension of the above observations and deductions predicts that the importance of Type-B green algae can increase in (1) nutrient deficient lakes, when competition for the limiting nutrients temporally decreases (for example after the breakdown of some equilibrium state) or (2) in lakes where the frequency and intensity of nutrient rich microenvironments are so high that they represent the community average (for example fishponds and other perturbed eu-hypertrophic waters), which agrees well with what is widely experienced in nature. Planktonic desmids and several chlorococcal species of green algae (Type-A) may also be as rare, but their seasonal appearance is repetitive, and under certain circumstances they may outcompete the otherwise regularly dominant algae.

It is found that surface cyclones affecting the Canadian territories originate mostly from the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains, the Atlantic coast of the United States (U.S.) and the eastern North Pacific basin. The explosive deepening of these systems is shown to occur preferentially along the Atlantic coast of both Canada and the U.S. It is also found that regions of most frequent occurrence of cyclones include Baffin Island, the Davis Strait, the northern Great Lakes and northern Newfoundland. A more detailed examination of the Canadian Atlantic Storms Program II (GASP II) season of January-March 1992 shows an anomalously large number of rapid cyclogenesis events occurring in the Atlantic coastal region of Canada. This anomaly is found in association with a persistent large-scale region of an unusually cold air mass.

If interstrain differences in these traits were found, such differences might help explain the apparent failure of stocked fish of these strains to develop large, naturally reproducing populations in the Great Lakes. The complex temporal changes in plasma hormone levels that occur during sexual maturation in lake trout have not been previously described. We detected little evidence of temporal isolation that would prevent interbreeding among the three strains. Strain had no effect on ovulation date (OD) in either year. Strain did not affect spermiation onset date (SOD) in year 1 but did in year 2, when the mean SOD of Jenny Lake males was earlier than that of Seneca Lake males but not different from that of Marquette males. Hormonal data were normalized around ODs for individual females and SODs for individual males. In females, estradiol-17beta (E2) was highest 8 weeks before the OD; the highest testosterone (T) level occurred 6 weeks before the OD, and the next highest level occurred simultaneously with the highest level of 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) 2 weeks before the OD. Plasma levels of 17alpha-hydroxy-20beta-dihydroprogesterone (DHP) peaked 1 week before the OD, then abruptly declined immediately after. Cortisol (F), triiodothyronine (T3), and thyroxine (T4) were highly variable, but F was the only hormone that showed no trend with week in either year. In males, plasma E2 levels were highest 3 weeks before the SOD, highest levels of T and of 11-KT occurred simultaneously 2 weeks after the SOD, and DHP peaked 5 weeks after the SOD and 3 weeks after the highest levels of T and 11-KT. As in females, plasma levels of F, T3, and T4 were highly variable, and F was the only hormone that showed no trend with week in either year. Strain had no effect on any hormones in females and only on T and F in males. The lack of pronounced interstrain differences in gamete ripening dates and reproductive endocrinology and the similarity of the temporal patterns and relative concentrations of hormones to those reported for other salmonids suggest nothing unusual or dysfunctional about these reproductive traits that would impede lake trout rehabilitation in the Great Lakes.																			0002-8487					MAR	1993	122	2					252	267		10.1577/1548-8659(1993)122<0252:GRAHCI>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1993)122<0252:GRAHCI>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1993LL92100009

Data from 65 north-temperate lake-years are used to compare such relationships of temporal variance as functions of mean concentration for both total phosphorus (TP) and chlorophyll a (Chl a). We found TP to be less seasonally variable than Chl a, confirming several regional analyses and strengthening the established recommendations that variability in Chl a should dictate sampling program design.																			0706-652X					MAY	1992	49	5					975	977		10.1139/f92-108	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f92-108													WOS:A1992HT32800014
J	MAIER, G				MAIER, G			THE SEASONAL CYCLE OF THERMOCYCLOPS-CRASSUS (FISCHER, 1853) (COPEPODA, CYCLOPOIDA) IN A SHALLOW, EUTROPHIC LAKE	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The seasonal cycle of Thermocyclops crassus was studied from 1985 to 1987, in the Gronne, a shallow, productive lake. T. crassus was present from late April to early October, while water temperature was above 10.degree.C. It produced three generations per year. Population peak was usually reached by the second generation, in August. Abundance was positively correlated with water temperature. Females carried 18.3 to 32.3 eggs on average. Reproduction rates were highest in July and August. Sex ratio was low, as females generally outnumbered males. Between October and April copepodites 4 went in diapause, predominantly in the deepest part of the lake and 0-4 cm deep in the bottom mud. Variations in body size were low across the year. T. crassus coexisted with the cyclopids, Cyclops vicinus and Mesocyclops leuckarti. In 1985 and 1986, abundances of M. leuckarti were low, while those of T. crassus and C. vicinus were high. In 1987 lower water temperatures, caused by cold weather, resulted in a marked decrease of the population density of T. crassus, while the abundance of M. leuckarti increased, and density of C. vicinus remained high. Comparison of the egg duration times of T. crassus, C. vicinus and M. leuckarti showed that at 15.degree.C and below T. crassus may be outcompeted by its comparatively longer egg development times. However, experiments in limnocorrals showed that T. crassus has an advantage over C. vicinus when fish predation is high.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUL 10	1989	178	1					43	58		10.1007/BF00006112	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00006112													WOS:A1989AJ67200004

Fish were caught and handled by charterboat operators and sport fishermen. Mortality was estimated by returning hooked fish to the lake after tethering them to a line-buoy system. Overall hooking mortality was estimated to be 14.9% (95% C.I. = 7.4-25.7). Significantly higher mortalities occurred in fish that were not discovered to have been hooked and in fish of smaller size classes. In addition, lake trout that were hooked in internal regions produced a mortality of 71.4% whereas those hooked in the upper or lower jaw had a mortality of 6.9%. The depth from which the fish was angled, the temperature differential from this depth to the surface, gear type, and handling times had no significant impact on survival. These results support the use of size limits, creel limits, and season restrictions as effective methods to reduce sport fishing mortality of lake trout.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				AUG	1988	45	8					1473	1479		10.1139/f88-172	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f88-172													WOS:A1988P807100017

The delta was formed in an ice-contact lake during deglaciation towards the end of the last glaciation. Subsequently the lake was drained and permafrost conditions developed in these poorly sorted gravel deposits. Hydrostatic pressure was transmitted from the adjacent glacier to the non-frozen core of the delta beneath the discontinuous permafrost crust and the seasonally frozen active layer. Owing to increased hydrostatic pressure, a network of subhorizontal to vertical fissures was opened along the taliks. In these fissures free ground-water flow and sediment transport were established. Tunnel erosion and probably also seepage erosion were associated with these fissures. Subsequently, the fissures and tunnels were filled by laminated fine sediments interbedded with poorly sorted material resulting in the formation of fissure-fill sediments and tunnel-fill sediments.																			0267-8179					MAR	1994	9	1					59	72		10.1002/jqs.3390090106	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jqs.3390090106													WOS:A1994NF74100005
J	WIENS, TP; CUTHBERT, FJ				WIENS, TP; CUTHBERT, FJ			NEST-SITE TENACITY AND MATE RETENTION OF THE PIPING PLOVER	WILSON BULLETIN												Piping Plovers (Charadrius melodus) were studied for three breeding seasons (1982-1984) at Lake of the Woods, Minnesota, [.+-.SA] to detemine the effects of previous breeding success on nest-site tenacity and mate retention. The population consisted of approximately 47 adults that nested at four breeding localities within the study area. Nest-site tenacity was strong; 84% of all breeding birds nested within 200 m of their nest site of the previous year. No significant relationship was found between previous breeding success and nest-site tenacity. Moderate mate retention was observed; of all pairs for which both members returned to the study area the subsequent season, 45% reunited. No significant relationship was found between previous breeding success and mate retention. This study demonstrates the importance of protecting traditional breeding sites used by threatened and endangered populations of Piping Plovers.																			0043-5643					DEC	1988	100	4					545	553																WOS:A1988R494000003

Aims To investigate habitat and prey utilization in a growing population of Great White Egrets in different periods of the breeding season and in relation to the water level at the foraging sites. Methods During three breeding seasons, we quantified the utilization of feeding areas and prey by means of aerial surveys and observations on the ground. Results Fish of open water areas within the reed beds of Lake Neusiedl is the main type of prey during the breeding season. Variation in habitat utilization was higher within breeding seasons than among years. The number of foraging individuals in fish-dominated habitats increased linearly during the season, corresponding to decreasing water levels. The utilization of amphibian-dominated habitats showed two peaks related to the spawning period and larval development of prey items. Conclusion The availability of fish within the reed beds of Lake Neusiedl is crucial for the largest population of Great White Egrets in western and middle Europe. The recent increase of this population is probably, in part, caused by an increase of fish availability due to local habitat changes.

J	Brown, KM				Brown, KM			Temporal and spatial patterns of abundance in the gastropod assemblage of a macrophyte bed	AMERICAN MALACOLOGICAL BULLETIN												Although gastropods are more common and diverse in macrophyte beds than in areas without littoral vegetation, little is known of fine-scale patterns of abundance within macrophyte beds, or changes in abundance of species through time. I present data here on such patterns in the gastropod assemblage found in Carrol Lake, Wisconsin. The assemblage was quite diverse, with 13 species, four of which had mean densities greater than 100/m(2). The assemblage was dominated by small, thick-shelled species, especially Amnicola limosa Say, 1817. Gastropod density decreased across two field seasons, although trends within each field season were for increases with time in the abundance of most species, especially in shallower habitats. At the micro-habitat scale, abundances of the most common species were positively correlated, perhaps because they prefer to colonize the same macrophytes, based on the results of laboratory macrophyte-choice experiments.																			0740-2783						1997	14	1					27	33																WOS:000071336400004

The reservoir was built on the Zambezi river on the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe. The crustacean zooplankton of this man-made lake were studied over 3 years from March 1986 to February 1988. This period included three seasons - (i) warm, rainy season, (ii) cool, dry season and (iii) warm, dry season - which have a major influence on the limnology of the lake. Crustacean plankton species composition and abundance varied among the five basins. The most upstream basin had the highest number of species and highest densities at all the sampling times over the period of this study. There was both spatial and temporal heterogeneity in species composition and abundance along the long axis of the lake.																			0142-7873					JAN	1997	19	1					43	62		10.1093/plankt/19.1.43	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/19.1.43													WOS:A1997WH66200004
J	NAGATA, T				NAGATA, T			PRODUCTION-RATE OF PLANKTONIC BACTERIA IN THE NORTH BASIN OF LAKE BIWA, JAPAN	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Vertical and seasonal variations in the cell number and production rate of planktonic bacteria were investigated at a pelagic site (water depth, ca. 72 m) of the north basin of Lake Biwa during April to October 1986. The [methyl-3H]thymidine uptake rate into a cold trichloroacetic acid-insoluble fraction and the frequency of dividing cells (FDCs) were measured for each sample as indices of the bacterial production rate. The seasonal data of bacterial number, thymidine uptake rate, and bacterial growth rate based on the FDCs were correlated with one another (rank correlation analysis, P < 0.05). These bacterial variables were not correlated positively with the chlorophyll a concentration. Vertically, the maxima of both bacterial number and the thymidine uptake rate were found in the euphotic zone. The direct counting of bacteria and the measurements of thymidine uptake rate combined with the size-fractionation method revealed that more than 90% of the bacterial biomass and production rate were attributed to unattached bacteria throughout the investigation period. The carbon flux estimates of bacterial production were less certain due to the variability of the conversion factor for the thymidine uptake method and that of the calibration for the FDC method, but even when the conservative range of bacterial net production rate was used (5 to 60 .mu.g of carbon per liter per day), it can be suggested that bacterial net production in the investigated area was a significant fraction (ca. 30%) of the level of the primary production rate in the same water basin.																			0099-2240	1098-5336				DEC	1987	53	12					2872	2882		10.1128/AEM.53.12.2872-2882.1987	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.53.12.2872-2882.1987								16347503					WOS:A1987L057500032

Pall. subsp. robustus (Miq.) T. Koyama and Sparganium fallax Graebn., in the Yuan-Yang Lake were studied. Nutrients in the lakewater were scarce and did not vary significantly between seasons. The porewater, in general, had higher concentrations of nutrients than the lakewater. The nutrient concentrations of porewaters were varied among sampling sites. Decomposition of organic matters in the lake and geographical characteristics of the watershed are the sources of differences in nutrient contents among sampling sites of porewaters in the lake. Higher contents of dissolved organic carbon and ammonium and potassium ions in the porewater were found in sites of water entrance areas. High contents of Ca and Mg ions in the lakewater and porewater were only found in the northwestern site of the lake. Nitrogen and potassium, which are concentrated in the aboveground tissues, are the major elements in tissues of dominant aquatic angiosperms. Nitrogen and potassium were consumed luxuriously before the growing season, and the contents in tissues gradually decreased during the growing period. However, no obvious seasonal change was found for Na, Ca, and Mg. The yearly budget of uptake and loss of nutrients through Sparganium fallax is estimated to be 13.8 g m(-2) N, 1.1 g m(-2) P, and 19.8 g m(-2) K in 1997, and 9.9 g m(-2) N, 0.6 g m(-2) P, and 9.2 g m(-2) K in 1998.																			0006-8063					OCT	2000	41	4					275	282																WOS:000165220200004

It is commercially important in many lakes and reservoirs, and recently has been introduced into other waters. However, very little is known about its biology including growth. In this paper we studied the population structure and the growth of the icefish in Xujiahe Reservoir (central China) from May 1995 to December 1997. The icefish completed its life cycle within about one year and the population consisted of one cohort. The main growth period was May to December and little growth occurred at other times.

Holomixis occurs in the dry season, generally for a few days at a time. Phytoplankton biomass exhibited a seasonal pattern, with a maximum (July average: chlorophyll a 8.4 mu g/l) during dry season holomids, associated with elevated phosphorus concentrations, and a mini-mum (February average: chlorophyll a 4.8 mu g/l) in the wet season due to wash-out. Over a two year period, the phytoplankton population was dominated by Peridinium spp. (0 - 4 m depth average: 57% of total biomass), and to a lesser extent desmids' (17%) and Botryococcus braunii (12%). Dry season holomixis caused a temporary perturbation in phytoplankton composition to favour diatoms, predom-inately Aulacoseira granulata, though significant populations of Peridinium, desmids and Botryococcus persisted. With the onset of stratification, and sedimentation of diatoms, the Peridinium-desmid-Botryococcus assemblage resumed domination of the reservoir's phytoplankton biomass. Autogenic succession, from C- to S-strategist phytoplankton was not detected. The phytoplankton assemblage of Manton River Reservoir is dominated by S-strategist phytoplankton, with temporary assemblage perturbations caused by holomictic and wash-out disturbances.																			1434-2944						1998	83				SI		113	120																WOS:000078647300013

Royle) grown in outdoor tanks was exposed to bensulfuron methyl concentrations of 25, 50, or 100 ppb on June 16, August 20 or October 15, 50 ppb June 16 and August 20, or 25 ppb on June 16, July 21, August 20, and October 15, 1990, with a 35-day contact time. Hydrilla was also exposed to the compound on August 9, 1991 at concentrations of 10, 20, 30, 40, or 50 ppb. In 1990, the August 20 exposure resulted in the greatest inhibition of tuber production for a single application. Exposure in June caused hydrilla to produce at least twice as many tubers as unexposed plants by April 10, 1991. Exposure in October arrested tuber production, which had already begun. Exposure in June and August delayed tuber formation until after February 9, 1991. Exposure in June, July, August, and October inhibited tuber formation for the entire growing season. Hydrilla treated with all concentrations of bensulfuron methyl on August 9, 1991 produced tubers only sporadically through March 16, 1992, compared to unexposed hydrilla, which produced an average of 48 tubers/531 sq cm by January 4, 1992. With the onset of warmer weather after March 16, tubers produced by unexposed hydrilla more than doubled, and comparable numbers of new tubers were produced by plants that were exposed to 10 or 20 ppb. Tuber production was inhibited for the entire growing season by exposure to 50 ppb on August 9, 1991. In spite of the promise that bensulfuron methyl showed for use in aquatic plant management, the Experimental Use Permit was not renewed in 1992 and efforts to register the compound were discontinued.																			0018-8158					DEC 6	1996	340	1-3					247	251		10.1007/BF00012763	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00012763													WOS:A1996WJ83800040

J	Bronge, C				Bronge, C			Hydrographic and climatic changes influencing the proglacial Druzhby drainage system, Vestfold Hills, Antarctica	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												Freshwater drainage systems, fed by melting of nearby inland ice and perennial snowdrifts, exist in the south-eastern part of arid, ice-free, coastal Vestfold Hills. Most important is the complex Druzhby system. Intriguing questions arise about the conditions controlling its seasonal development and about the consequences of possible changes of those conditions. A water-balance was calculated for 1990-91. The system went through four seasonal phases of which only one displayed a fully developed external drainage. Evidently, the relative duration of those phases can vary considerably from one year to another. The system depends critically on the water supply from ice-dammed Chelnok Lake, which could readily be drained by a minor retreat of Sorsdal Glacier. Exposed to excessive evaporation, the large Crooked Lake would then become internally drained and reach a new equilibrium in similar to 830 years. A Crooked Lake sediment core can be interpreted as suggesting this occurred during the Holocene. The idea, inferred from striae, of a late Holocene Chelnok Glaciation reaching the northern shores of Crooked Lake is questioned. Instead, it is suggested that the Chelnok striae originate from local basal melting of the ice sheet draining southward into a deglaciated Sorsdal trough. At present, runoff is determined by opposing short and long-term climatic influences.																			0954-1020					DEC	1996	8	4					379	388		10.1017/S0954102096000557	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954102096000557													WOS:A1996VY20500009

The fatty acid composition of the muscle of vendace and its feed, zooplankton, was studied in two lakes in eastern Finland during the ice free period. 2. In plankton the unsaturation index and omega-3/omega-6 ratio was lowest during the warm period. The amount of eicosapentaenoic acid exceeded that of docosahexaenoic acid. 3. Although in young vendace (0 +) the fatty acid spectrum resembled that in plankton, older fish had differences depending on season and spawning. The amount of docosahexaenoic acid was much higher than eicosapentaenoic acid especially in the older fish. 4. The results suggest that ability to modify the fatty acids develops with age in vendace.																			1096-4959	1879-1107					1989	92	1					75	79		10.1016/0305-0491(89)90315-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0305-0491(89)90315-5													WOS:A1989R783200011

Phytoplankton biomass was minimal (as low as 60 mg.cntdot.m-3) during the phase of stable stratification and maximal, as high as 930 mg.cntdot.m-3, at the end of the period of deep mixing. Diatoms, especially Nitzschia spp., were abundant only during the period of mixing, while filamentous blue-greens, principally Anabaena sp., were prominent during a period of rapid surface warming which produced shallow mixed layers following the period of deepest mixing. The biomass of Strombidium cf. viride nearly equaled or exceeded the phytoplankton biomass during much of the stably stratified period; this protozoan probably has a symbiotic relationship with zoochlorellae, which were always present in it. Lake Tanganyika showed a greater relative annual range between maximum and minimum phytoplankton and chlorophyll a concentrations than other tropical lakes and the temperate Great Lakes. Chlorophyll a ranged from 0.1-4.5 mg.cntdot.m-3 in the euphotic zone and from 0.2-20.4 in surface waters; phytoplankton biomass ranged from 25-1570 mg.cntdot.m-3 in the euphotic zone. Annual mean concentrations were among the lowest known, 140 mg.cntdot.m-3 for phytoplankton biomass and 1.2 mg.cntdot.m-3 for chlorophyll a. Explanations for both the low annual means and the high annual variabilities may lie in the lake''s steep morphometry, which affects nutrient regeneration, and in high loss rates which cause high algal growth rates, but low algal biomass much of the year.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1981	26	3					548	564		10.4319/lo.1981.26.3.0548	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1981.26.3.0548													WOS:A1981LS52200014
J	Baca, RM; Threlkeld, ST				Baca, RM; Threlkeld, ST			Using size distributions to detect nutrient and sediment effects within and between habitats	HYDROBIOLOGIA												We studied the use of size distributions as a response variable in limnological experiments. Previous quantifications of size distributions were incomplete or difficult to use in experimental settings, and we developed a multivariate approach that more fully describes the shape and biomass of planktonic and benthic size distributions. We re-evaluate the hypothesis that fish affect the shape and nutrients affect the biomass of size distributions, and show that the multivariate approach is more responsive to detecting treatment effects. In a mesocosm experiment, we use this new quantification and analysis of size distributions to detect the main and interactive effects of nutrient addition and sediment type on both benthic and pelagic size distributions. Size distributions in both habitats responded to the nutrient and sediment treatments, indicating linkage since a treatment applied in one habitat affected the size distribution in the opposite habitat. Since size distributions reduce each habitat into a common currency, we were able to examine the nature of the linkage. The relative response of each habitat to the nutrient treatment was different with regard to the shape of the distributions, while the relative response to the sediment treatment was different with regard to the biomass in the distributions.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP	2000	435	1-3					197	211		10.1023/A:1004118000669	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1004118000669													WOS:000165253800019

No attempt will be made to consider the effects of changing carbon dioxide and moisture contents of the atmosphere that might have occurred at the same time. Atmospheric transport and recirculation of air and aerosols are considered and shown to occur on a large scale. Size distributions, residence times and concentrations of aerosols are examined and air volume and aerosol mass transports are estimated. South African data from stations on the interior plateau are used to approximate present-day seasonal and interannual variations in transmissivity due to changing aerosol loading in the atmosphere. A lake-catchment hydrological model is used to determine rainfall over Lake Tanganyika and its environs and from this a sensitivity analysis of rainfall receipt to aerosol-induced changes in atmospheric transmissivity is carried out. It is shown that a decrease in transmissivity commensurate with the present-day interannual range of variability of 10 per cent produces, in the absence of other changes, about a 15 per cent diminution in rainfall. The analysis is extended to show that in the past, during the sixteenth-century Little Ice Age, the transmissivity induced rainfall decrease could have been about 25 per cent and that at 18000 years BP it would have been more. Aerosol loading is shown to have important consequences for the occurrence of droughts through its modification of the surface radiation balance.

J	DOORNBOS, G; TWISK, F				DOORNBOS, G; TWISK, F			DENSITY, GROWTH AND ANNUAL FOOD-CONSUMPTION OF GOBIID FISH IN THE SALINE LAKE GREVELINGEN, THE NETHERLANDS	NETHERLANDS JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH												Within the scope of a study of the carbon budget of the 108 km2 saline Lake Grevelingen, investigations were made on density, mortality, growth and food consumpton of the main gobiid fish during the period 1980 to 1982. In August 1980 the O-group of Pomatoschistus minutus was estimated at 424 million individuals (on average 3.9 fishes per m2) with a biomass of 203 tons FW. In 1981 and 1982 peak numbers were less high. O-group P. microps accounted for 282 million individuals (2.6 fishes per m2) and 133 tons FW in September 1981. By far the highest density was found in the O to 0.6 m zone, 15 common gobies per m2 (7 g FW .cntdot. m-2). With approximately 5.1 million individuals (13 tons FW) Gobius niger was most abundant in 1982. For adult G. niger a monthly mortality of 27% was estimated. Mortality rates in P. minutus and P. microps were found to be fairly constant over the year. The estimated rates of annual mortality of 99.9% (.apprx. 46% per month) and 99.996% (.apprx.57% per month), respectively, appear to be much higher than recorded for estuarine populations. Approximately 60% of the decline in numbers of demersal gobiid fish could be accounted for by the predation of two species of flatfish and two species of piscivorous birds. Young of the year of over 20 mm total length of both species were first caught in June. At the end of the first growing season, the average length and weight of P. microps was 39 mm and 0.6 g FW. In their second year they attained an average size of 51 mm. In O-group P. minutus, the 1980 and 1981 year classes reached an average length of 45 mm and 57 mm, respectively. In the second year, however, the difference disappeared and the mean length in both classes approximated 62 mm. Juvenile G. niger were first caught in August at a length of approximately 3.5 cm. They attained an average size of 4 to 5 cm in the first year, 8 to 8.5 cm in the second and 11 to 12.5 cm in the third year. The maximum production of P. minutus and P. microps, although reached in alternate years, amounted to 1.1 g and 0.8 g ADW .cntdot. m-1 .times.. a-1, respectively, of which 92 to 98% was realized before the moment the maximum numbers (of individuals larger than 20 mm) were actually caught (August/September). In 1980, diets of P. microps and P. minutus up to a size of approximately 40 mm consisted largely of copepods. With increasing length, they switched to larger epibenthic crustaceans. Annual food consumption for the 1980 P. minutus year class and 1981 P. microps year class was estimated at 1.95 g and .16 g ADW .cntdot. m-2, respectively. The former species derived 91% of its annual food demands from copepods, and in the latter it was even 95%.																			0077-7579					MAR	1987	21	1					45	74		10.1016/0077-7579(87)90022-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0077-7579(87)90022-6													WOS:A1987G731500005
J	MORTON, FI				MORTON, FI			OPERATIONAL ESTIMATES OF LAKE EVAPORATION	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The complementary relationship between areal and potential evapotranspiration takes into account the changes in the temperature and humidity of the air as it passes from a land environment to a lake environment. Minor changes convert the latest version of the complementary relationship areal evapotranspiration (CRAE) models to a complementary relationship lake evaporation (CRLE) model. The ability of the CRLE model to produce reliable estimates of annual lake evaporation from monthly values of temperature, humidity and sunshine duration (or global radiation) observed in the land environment with no locally optimized coefficients is tested against comparable water-budget estimates for 11 lakes in North America and Africa. Maps of annual lake evaporation and annual net reservoir evaporation (i.e., the difference between lake evaporation and areal evapotranspiration) for the part of Canada to the east of the Pacific Divide and for the southern USA are presented. An approximate routing technique, which takes into account the effects of depth and salinity on the seasonal pattern of monthly lake evaporation, is formulated and tested against comparable water-budget estimates for 10 lakes in North America and Africa. The results indicate that the CRLE model, with its associated routing technique, is much superior to the other techniques in current use that rely on climatological or pan observations in the land environment.																			0022-1694	1879-2707					1983	66	1-4					77	100		10.1016/0022-1694(83)90178-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-1694(83)90178-6													WOS:A1983RH79700002
J	Olosutean, H				Olosutean, Horea			DOES POPULATION DENSITY DETERMINE THE MATING STRATEGY IN MALES OF THE WATER STRIDER ⁢AQUARIUS PALUDUM⁢?	ENTOMOLOGICAL NEWS												Mating behavior of a large Aquarius paludum paludum (Fabricius 1794) (Hemiptera: Gerridae: Gemini) population was investigated on several field surveys during the mating season. Both types of mating behavior known for semi- aquatic true bugs were observed in the studied population: aggressive Type I mating for non-territorial males and unaggressive Type II mating for the territorial males. Some males establish individual territories at the lake shores that they defend for around one hour and switch to aggressive mating if they fail to attract a female to mate, while most males remain non-territorial. Radial 1-1.5 meter territories were aggressively defended from other males, conflicts being always won by the male already occupying the territory. The presence of Type II males is conditioned by the absence of sufficient space for all males to establish territories. Contact guarding was much longer than documented before for A. paludum paludum. lasting for at least 12-13 hours in some cases. Based on the observations and on the existing information on the group, a more comprehensive classification of mating behavior of true bugs is proposed: Type I - non-territorial, unsignaled grasping. with contact guarding; Type II - territorial, signaled mounting with noncontact guarding; Type III - non-territorial, signaled mounting with contact guarding.																			0013-872X	2162-3236				APR	2018	127	4					349	360		10.3157/021.127.0407	http://dx.doi.org/10.3157/021.127.0407													WOS:000430495600008

These relationships are investigated at Lake Taihu, China, where the cropland around the basin is devoted to growing rice. Our aim is to study the effects of the rainfall and non-point source contamination on surface water quality, with a specific focus on Nitrate Potassium Permanganate Chemical. Oxidant (CODMn) and Nitrates (NH3-N), and using satellite remote sensing to construct a pollution estimation model by using satellite data and surface data from 7 monitoring station surveys in 2008-2015. Comparing measured values and remote sensing predicted values, the average of CODMn relative deviation is -0.775 and the average of NH3-N relative deviation is -0.030, both within a reasonable range. Experimental data shows that the lower concentrations of NH3-N occurred when rainfalls are high, the CODMn's temporal and spatial distributions have high variability, and the interaction between seasons and rainfall rate explains variability of NH3-N and CODMn concentrations in surface waters.

J	Kattel, GR				Kattel, G. R.			Application of Sediment Traps in Global Change Research in Mountain Lakes	JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE												Representativity of biota in the biosphere also have similar significance in the lithosphere after their death. Recently, taphonomic representation of biota in the lithosphere has been widely used for minimizing the biases in palaeo-environmental reconstructions including global climate change. In September 2001, a sediment trap was installed at the central area of the Loch Coire Fionnaraich (LCFR), a small, oligotrophic mountain loch in northwest Scotland for a taphonomic study of cladoceran zooplankton. The trap was emptied on a seasonal basis, where an average 0.14 g dry material was recovered in each season, January, May and August 2002 respectively. A sediment core was also taken from near the sediment trap location. The top 0.5 cm section, the 'core' was used for a comparative study with the trap sediment samples. The planktonic Cladocera consisted of Bosmina coregoni and appeared to have excellent preservation in the trap assemblages. Moreover, some common littoral Cladocera such as Alonella excisa and Alona guttata appear to be less well preserved in the fossil assemblages. Large littoral taxa such as Eurycercus lamellatus and Alona quadrangularis were rare in the trap but relatively common and well preserved in the sediment-water interface. It is suggested that taphonomic processes play a dominant role on deposition of fossil remains of Cladocera and caution should be taken while inferring the past environmental changes whilst using fossil assemblages recovered from the lake centre as a representation of the entire cladoceran community in the lake.

J	Koc, J; Duda, M				Koc, Jozef; Duda, Marcin			THE ROLE OF STORAGE RESERVOIRS IN REDUCING CALCIUM MIGRATION FROM AGRICULTURAL CATCHMENTS	JOURNAL OF ELEMENTOLOGY												This study was conducted on a storage reservoir situated in a valley, in the lower course of the Szabruk stream in north-eastern Poland, the Olsztyn Lakeland mesoregion. The catchment area of the Szabruk stream consists of an agricultural and an afforested part. A storage reservoir is found in the lower part of the Szabruk stream valley. The reservoir was built 25 years ago. It is enclosed by a dike and equipped with an outlet box. Outflows from the reservoir pass through the terminal segment of the Szabruk stream to Lake Wulpinskie. The results of the experiment indicate that the calcium content of water evacuated from the catchment was determined by the type and intensity of catchment use, ranging from 22.3 mg Ca.dm(-3) to 178 mg Ca.dm(-3). The highest calcium concentrations, 113 mg Ca.dm(-3) on average, were noted in the agricultural catchment connected to a drainage network; lower levels, 78.7 mg Ca.dm(-3), were found in farming areas drained via ditches, while the lowest Ca content in water, 38.7 mg Ca.dm(-3) on average, was determined in outflows from afforested catchments. Calcium concentrations were lower during the growing season in all studied catchment types. The calcium load discharged from the catchment dependnded on the catchment management. The highest calcium loss per area unit was observed in the drained agricultural catchment (76.6 kg Ca.ha(-1).year(-1)), followed by the catchment drained via ditches (56.3 Ca.ha(-1).year(-1)) and the afforested catchment (31.8 Ca.ha(-1).year(-1)). Despite the inflow of calcium-rich drainage water, calcium concentrations decreased by 11%, from 56.8 mg Ca.dm(-3) to 50.3 mg Ca.dm(-3), after the stream's waters passed through the storage reservoir. An increase in Ca levels was noted in the girdling ditch. The flow of water through the ditch minimizes sedimentation, and higher quantities of Ca were supplied with drainage water. The reservoir accumulated 242.4 kg Ca per ha in the course of one year, mostly in the growing season (83%). The above indicates high involvement of biological processes. The reservoir fulfilled the role of a barrier inhibiting calcium loss from the catchment.																			1644-2296					SEP	2009	14	3					467	476		10.5601/jelem.2009.14.3.05	http://dx.doi.org/10.5601/jelem.2009.14.3.05													WOS:000270434600005
J	MacKinnon, MR; Herbert, BW				MacKinnon, MR; Herbert, BW			Temperature, dissolved oxygen and stratification in a tropical reservoir, Lake Tinaroo, northern Queensland, Australia	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Thermal and oxygen depth profiles in Lake Tinaroo were measured monthly at six sites over a two-year period from May 1988 to July 1990. Lake Tinaroo exhibits thermal layering throughout most of the year. Partitioning of the water column into an oxygenated epilimnion and a deoxygenated hypolimnion was well established by October each year. Breakdown of stratification occurred in late May to June and persisted until September. From October to May multiple thermoclines (diurnal, parent) developed, particularly during still weather. Localized disruption of stratification by oxygenated, cool, denser inflows during flood events in the catchment occurred during the rainy season. Thermocline tilting was noted after prolonged periods of south-easterly winds, with a deeper thermocline/oxycline at the north-western end of the lake. South-westerly winds had a corresponding effect on the north-east of the lake. The distribution of oxygenated water and deoxygenated water, affected by seasonal stratification, thermocline tilting, upwelling and flood-mediated disruption of stratification, is of importance to recreational fisheries and the location of water intake points for urban and domestic use. Lake Tinaroo has thermal characteristics of outer tropical rather than equatorial tropical lakes, owing in part to altitude effects.

Wild and cultivated forms of this indigenous vegetable contained two major pyrrolizidine alkaloids on thin layer chromatography, but in quantities that were too small to quantify by H-1 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance or Ultraviolet spectrometry. Based on the detection limits of these methods and dietary data from Tarime District, Tanzania, we estimate the Potential Weekly Intake of the vegetable during the peak season of consumption to be 305 mu g/week/person. This does not account for detoxification during cooking. While the nutritional benefits of this vegetable likely outweigh any detrimental effects of the alkaloids, the recognized hepatotoxicity of these compounds may outweigh the benefits under some circumstances.

A 15 cm thick limestone bed about 40 m above the base, contains abundant bivalve shells of the species Palaeanodonta fisheri. P. castor and Palaeomutela sp. These relatively thick shells are chalky-white and the internal microstructure is preserved in some specimens as complex-crossed lamellas, which are always aragonite, and prismatic fibers which may be aragonite or calcite. Mineralogical tests confirm aragonite in microstructurally pristine specimens. This is the oldest-known locality for biogenic aragonite in China. The bivalves of northwestern China are geochemically distinct from typically marine and terrestrial counterparts. Their Sr, Mg, Mn, and Fe contents are strongly habitat controlled by ambient environmental conditions and support the postulated lacustrine paleoecology for the limestones of the Wutonggou Formation. Modelling of deltaC-13 values (-2.9 to -3.9 parts per thousand, PDB) and Fe suggests that Palaeanodonta and Palaeomutela preferred shallow waters and the values are well within the seasonal variation expected for north temperate lakes. The light and relatively constant deltaO-18 values (-12.0 to -12.1 parts per thousand, PDB) of the bivalves suggest that Wutonggou surface lake waters were probably well mixed. The modeled deltaO-18 value of -11 to -15 parts per thousand (SMOW) for annual meteoric precipitation, influenced by snow meltwater, appears reasonable for situated about 50-60-degrees-N of the Permian equator.																			0891-2556	1878-5212					1993	8	2					199	212		10.1007/BF03175178	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF03175178													WOS:A1993MP39700009
J	SOTO, D; HURLBERT, SH				SOTO, D; HURLBERT, SH			SHORT-TERM EXPERIMENTS ON CALANOID-CYCLOPOID-PHYTOPLANKTON INTERACTIONS	HYDROBIOLOGIA												To investigate their potential effects on each other in nature, calanoid (Diaptomus clavipes and D. siciloides) and cyclopoid (Acanthocyclops vernalis and Mesocyclops edax) copepod populations were manipulated in 5 liter aquaria in laboratory experiments of 20-60 days duration. Diaptomus generally had a strongly negative effect on both cyclopoid species. The cyclopoids established populations more successfully when introduced to aquaria before calanoids than they did when calanoids were already present. On the other hand, whether introduced earlier or later than the cyclopoids, Diaptomus populations were unaffected by Acanthocyclops and were strongly depressed by Mesocyclops. Diaptomus effects on the phytoplankton were often strong but varied markedly among experiments. They included reduction of populations of edible algae, such as Chlamydomonas, which are essential for both calanoid and cyclopoid nauplii, and large increases in inedible algae, such as Kirchneriella. Feeding experiments revealed that under conditions of food scarcity Acanthocyclops nauplii survived less well than did Diaptomus nauplii. Competition for edible phytoplankton seemed to be a key factor in the calanoid-cyclopoid interactions, since the survival of herbivorous cyclopoid larvae determined the abundance of the predaceous adults. This indicates that the competitive effects of calanoids on cyclopoids often may exceed the predative effects of cyclopoids on calanoids.																			0018-8158					JUN 14	1991	215	2					83	110		10.1007/BF00014714	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00014714													WOS:A1991FY90800001

The mean number of pelicans fledged during those fears was 214 (+/-196 SD). In five of those years the number of pelicans fledged was at or near zero. In six other years, the number of young pelicans fledged ranged from 302-650, with four of those years producing record numbers of successfully fledged young. Maximum seasonal levels of Yellowstone Lake reaching 1.6 m or more produced complete or near complete reproductive failures. Conversely, years with maximum lake levels never reaching 1.4 m were most likely to have very good to outstanding fledging success. Also, numbers of days when air temperatures of -8.8 degrees C or colder and daily temperature minimums of -16.6 degrees C, as well as the duration of ice cover on Yellowstone Lake were important modifiers of the numbers of pelicans fledged. Unexpected crustal deformations adjacent to and within the Yellowstone Lake basin induced flooding, representing serious geologic threats to the long-term well being of the Molly Island pelican colony.

Early attempts at commercialization of this crop in the Southeast have frequently encountered difficulties in establishing stands. This 3-yr project (1986-1989) was undertaken to evaluate the effects of seeding depth and planter configuration (i.e., packing wheel pressure) on emergence of oilseed rape. The two field sites used for this study contained Lakeland sand (thermic, coated Typic Quartzipsamment) and Tifton loamy sand (fine, loamy, siliceous Plinthic Paleudult) soil types, respectively. Treatment factors were planter configuration, seeding depth, and cultivar. The experimental design was a randomized complete block with four replications. Planter configurations consisted of a Tye drill with both high and low pressure settings on the packing wheels and an Amazone drill with no packing wheel pressure (second season only). Seeding depths ranged from 0.25 to 2 in. Cultivars were 'Cascade' and 'Westar' for all three seasons and 'Bridger' during the last two seasons. Results showed better crop establishment when planted shallow (0.25-0.5 in.) than deep (1.5-2 in.). High packing wheel pressure at planting had a positive effect on stand when the crop was sown on sandy soil with little potential for surface crusting. For example, on the cultivar Cascade, the increased packing wheel pressure increased the stand density by 15% over the low packing wheel pressure in the second season. For Westar in the same season and at the 1.5 in. depth, the stand density increased nearly 40% when packing wheel pressure increased. However, on loamy sand soils, which have a greater potential for crusting, better emergence occurred when low packing wheel pressure was applied.																			0890-8524					JAN-MAR	1994	7	1					94	97		10.2134/jpa1994.0094	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jpa1994.0094													WOS:A1994NE41300010
J	DUARTE, CM; KALFF, J				DUARTE, CM; KALFF, J			INFLUENCE OF LAKE MORPHOMETRY ON THE RESPONSE OF SUBMERGED MACROPHYTES TO SEDIMENT FERTILIZATION	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												The influence of lake morphometry on the growth of submerged macrophytes in response to sediment fertilization was studied at sites of varying bottom slope (steep to gentle), wave exposure (high to low), and depth (1.0 and 2.5 m) in Lake Memphremagog (Quebec [Canada]-Vermont [USA]). The biomass increases were on average 2.1 times greater for fertilized plants than for the paired controls. The extent of the growth response was greatest at the 1.0-m sites. The smaller response at the 2.5-m sites was further decreased as exposure to waves increased. The smaller response at 2.5m (depth of maximum biomass) suggests that factors such as light limitation, length of the growing season, and littoral slope, but not sediment nutrient levels, limit submerged biomass there. The importance of the physical factors appears to increase as the biomass increases. "Overwintering" plants showed greater response to fertilization than those growing from seeds. Overall, the extent of the growth response to sediment fertilization depends on the energy environment (i.e. depth, wave exposure, and slope) of the littoral. The influence of these physical factors explains previous difficulties in finding strong correlations between nutrient levels and the growth of submerged macrophytes.

J	Tiruneh, R				Tiruneh, R			A retrospective study on ruminant urethral obstruction in Debre Zeit area, Ethiopia	REVUE DE MEDECINE VETERINAIRE												A retrospective study was carried out to determine the importance and causes of ruminant urethral obstruction, during the period from January 1989 to July 1991 and August 1998 to March 1999 in Debre Zeit area, Ethiopia. Of the total 104 ruminant surgical cases, the prevalence of urethral obstruction in sheep and cattle accounted for 37.14 % (13/35) and 44.93 % (31/69), respectively. The two common causes of urethral obstruction were external trauma and uroliths. In the sheep both external trauma and uroliths represent 46.15 % (6) each, while in cattle the rates of occurrence were 35.48 % (11) and 29.03 % (9), respectively. The causes of obstruction were nor clearly identified in a significant proportion of cattle (35.48 %, n = 11), and in a single ram. In sheep, 53.38 % cases were with intact urethra, 15.38 % with ruptured urethra and 30.77 % with ruptured urinary bladder. In cattle, 64.52 % cases were with ruptured urethra. Intact urethra and ruptured urinary bladder cases accounted for 25.81 % and 9.68 %, respectively. Shortage of drinking water during the long dry season, watering of animals on salty crater-lake water and low vitamin A level in feed are considered as some of the important contributing factors in urolith formation in cattle. An imbalance in calcium and phosphorus ratio and high level of magnesium in commercially available and traditionally used concentrate feeds, respectively, were anticipated to be the major contributory factors in ovine urolithiasis. Analysis of mineral composition of the urolith samples from cattle revealed the presence of calcium and oxalate as major constituents. Results were discussed by comparison with literature data from other countries. Recommendations on possible control options and future areas of research were made.																			0035-1555					AUG-SEP	2000	151	8-9					855	860																WOS:000090009900009

Populations, determined by the wet sieving of soil cores, were dominated by the Tubificidae Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri. Total densities ranged from 0 to 40 000 m-2. Oligochaete numbers increased in response to additions of urea N. An inhibitory effect of carbofuran on oligochaete populations was observed during the first season of experimental pesticide treatments, but not during the following year. The green manure Sesbania rostrata stimulated population development more than Azolla microphylla. Populations in plots maintained as wet fallow remained low throughout the crop cycle. Population dynamics were associated with the crop cycle. Peak densities were achieved 30-50 days after transplanting.																			0178-2762					JUN	1993	16	1					27	33		10.1007/BF00336511	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00336511													WOS:A1993LL52000006

Verd. populations in two lakes and three drainage canals in northern California were screened for nitrogen and phosphorus deficiency using emergent leaf and stem critical concentration criteria. Seasonal variation in productivity and concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in emergent tissues were examined in one of the lentic populations, Park's Lake. Analysis of emergent leaf and stem tissues from Park's Lake indicated that N and P concentrations were below the upper 95 % confidence limits on the critical concentrations during much of the growing season. N:P ratios indicated that N was more limiting than P early in the growing season, and P was more limiting than N late in the growing season. The other lentic population, sampled late in the growing season, was marginally P-limited. Neither N or P limited growth in the drainage canals. Productivity, and tissue concentrations of N and P, in Park's Lake were higher in shallow (<0.5 m) than in deep areas (0.5-1.0 m). In a laboratory fertilization experiment, M. aquaticum growth was greater on deep sediments than shallow sediments. The field observations and laboratory experiments suggest that M. aquaticum productivity in deep water does not depend upon sediment nutrients. The ability of adventitious roots, formed on rhizomes in the water column, to access sediment nutrients may be an important determinant of M. aquaticum productivity.

J	EZAKI, Y				EZAKI, Y			ESTABLISHMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF THE BREEDING TERRITORY IN THE POLYGYNOUS GREAT REED WARBLER	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH												Settlement of male great reed warblers in the breeding ground was highly asynchronous at Lake Biwa in Japan. It took over 1 month from the appearance of the first male to a saturation in number of males. In resource-defense-polygyny, males are expected to try to defend as large an area as possible in the optimal habitat. In fact, a small number of the earliest settling males divided up the breeding ground almost completely as territories among themselves and these were later reduced in size with the addition of later settlers. The reduction was not due to a seasonal decline of aggressiveness on the part of the owners but to a higher level of intrusion pressure by later arriving males. The neighbor-neighbor relationship, once established, was rather stable. Home range overlap was small and territorial contacts were few between neighbors. Territorial boundaries seem not to shift despite the addition of new males as long as the neighbors were the same. The stable relationships between neighbors are expected to help the earlier resident to maintain his large and good territories throughout the breeding season and hence polygyny is favored in this species.																			0912-3814	1440-1703				DEC	1995	10	3					359	368		10.1007/BF02347862	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02347862													WOS:A1995TJ02600015

The subsequent accumulation has resulted in the formation of a Weichselian Pleniglacial terrace which has been deeply dissected by Late Glacial erosion. The present alluvial plain is formed by Late Glacial and Holocens infilling. The maximum incision of the Lake Glacial fluvial phase was reached slightly before 11,780 B.P. ad involved locally dry conditions which have given rise to aeolian activity during this period (Older Dryas). On the deepest parts of the Pleniglacial terrace, a backswamp environment was established until the end of the Allerod. At the beginning of the Younger Dryas the river invaded the terrace but shortly afterwards aeolian activity progressively increased. At the climax of the Younger Dryas, deep seasonal frost or local permafrost characterized the Mark valley.					; Vandenberghe, Jef/H-5846-2019	Vandenberghe, Jef/0000-0001-9910-1319; 													0300-9483	1502-3885				MAR 1	1987	16	1					55	67																WOS:A1987H242900005
J	ARNASON, AN; MILLS, KH				ARNASON, AN; MILLS, KH			BIAS AND LOSS OF PRECISION DUE TO TAG LOSS IN JOLLY-SEBER ESTIMATES FOR MARK-RECAPTURE EXPERIMENTS	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												A crucial, though often ignored, assumption of mark-recapture experiments is that animals do not lose their marks (tags). Results of theoretical analyses of the effects of tag loss on estimates of population size (.cxa.N), survival .cxa..vphi., births or new entries (.cxa.B), and on their standard errors (SE( )), for the Jolly-Seber (full) model allowing birth and death are presented. .cxa.N, SE(.cxa.N) and SE(.cxa..vphi.) are not biased by tag loss; .cxa..vphi. .cxa.B and SE(.cxa.B) are biased. A similar analysis for the Jolly-Seber (death-only) model where births are known not to occur shows that .cxa.N, .cxa..vphi. and SE(.cxa..vphi.) are strongly biased by tag loss; only SE(.cxa.N) is unbiased. For both models, tag loss causes a loss in precision in all estimates (i.e., an increase in the standard error of the estimate, leading to wider confidence intervals). Tag loss is assumed to be homogeneous among animals; that is, it is the same for all marked animals regardless of age, sex or tag-retention time, although the rate per unit time may change over time (e.g., over years or seasons within years). Analytic formulae are developed for both models, allowing calculation of the expected bias and SE in an estimate at given tag loss rates in a population of given size, subject to specified sampling, survival and birth rates. The analytic formulae are large sample approximations but are shown, by simulations, to be adequate provided marked captures (mi) and subsequent recoveries (ri) are no lower than around 5. How these calculations can be used in practical situations to plan experiments yielding adequately precise estimates is discussed. Whether corrections to compensate for tag loss are necessary is determined. Corrections are unnecessary if bias is slight or precision is poor. Otherwise, they should be corrected. The biased estimates from the full model (.cxa..vphi., SE(.cxa..vphi.) and .cxa.B) are correctable only if an estimate of tag-loss rate is available. The death-only model estimates can all be corrected to eliminate bias due to tag loss both with and without knowledge of the tag-loss rate. Knowledge of the tag-loss rate usually will give higher precision of the corrected estimates over those corrected without knowing the tag-loss rate. The Robson-Regier method of estimating tag loss can be used in experiments with double tagging where 1 tag is a permanent batch mark and where all recaptured animals are removed. This method is extended to allow for the multiple mark-recapture case where recaptures may be returned to the population. An example of the methods of estimating tag loss and then correcting the death-only model estimates is presented for some lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) data. Without the corrections, the estimates for these data would have been in serious error. The example provides some evidence that the correction may work even when the tag loss is not homogeneous across all animals. Recommendations are presented for planning mark-recapture experiments to minimize the problems created by tag loss.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1981	38	9					1077	1095		10.1139/f81-148	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f81-148													WOS:A1981MH23600009
J	Prescott, DRC; Norton, MR; Michaud, IMG				Prescott, DRC; Norton, MR; Michaud, IMG			Night surveys of Yellow Rails, Coturnicops noveboracensis, and Virginia Rails, Rallus limicola, in Alberta using call playbacks	CANADIAN FIELD-NATURALIST												The Yellow Rail (Cotumicops noveboracensis) and Virginia Rail (Rallus limicola) are inconspicuous and apparently rare species in Alberta. Wide scale, targeted surveys have never been conducted for either species, and virtually nothing is known about their distribution, populations, or other traits in the province. We compiled historical records of Yellow and Virginia Rails and conducted nocturnal field surveys using call playback as a first step in clarifying the status of these species in the province. Sixty-two Yellow Rail and 66 Virginia Rail historical sites were collated, with the majority of records occurring in the central and south-central parts of the province. A total of 431 surveys were conducted at 404 sites between 17 May and 6 July 2000. These sites included 69.4% and 60.6% of historical sites for Yellow and Virginia rails, respectively. We encountered 42 unique Yellow Rails and 59 unique Virginia Rails during the surveys, with only 7.0% and 17.5% of visited historical sites being occupied. Fifteen new sites for Yellow Rails were found. Most notable was the presence of 21 birds on Hay Lake in northwestern Alberta, which is a 450 km extension to the known breeding range. Twenty-three new sites for Virginia Rails were found. Playbacks were more effective at detecting Virginia Rails, as the number of spontaneously calling individuals was lower than was found for Yellow Rails (55.0% vs. 80.4%). Yellow Rails were most likely to be found in seasonal wetlands containing sedge, whereas Virginia Rails occupied a wide variety of semipermanent and permanent wetlands. Yellow Rails were most likely to be found when there was little or no moon, and during the middle (darkest) part of the night. Virginia Rails were found significantly more often when the moon was more than half full and relatively unobscured by clouds. The efficiency of future surveys for these species could therefore be improved by focusing efforts during periods and conditions when birds are most likely to be detected.																			0008-3550					JUL-SEP	2002	116	3					408	415																WOS:000182545900006

The seasonal odor episodes coincide with a bloom of Peridinium gatunense algae. The possibility that the dimethyloligosulfides are formed by bacterial degradation of Peridinium gatunense lysis products, under oxygen rich conditions was investigated. Several bacterial strains were isolated from the lake. Addition of Peridinium cells to the isolated bacteria cultures yielded dimethyldisulfide and dimethyltrisulfide. One of the bacteria strains, identified as Acinetobacter lwoffii, an obligatory aerobe was singled out for derailed investigation. Addition of Peridinium cells or methionine to the Acinetobacter culture yielded, under aerobic conditions dimethyldisulfide and dimethyltrisulfide. Cystein feed yielded only inorganic oligosulfides, which were converted to dimethylsulfides by addition of d(3)-methyliodide. (C) 1999 IAWQ Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Hitchcock, of the Paranapanema River mouth zone at Jurumirim Reservoir (SP, Brazil), were examined. Marked variation in nutrient concentrations (from 287.6 to 463.2 mg C g DW-1; 3.4 to 37.8 mg N g DW-1; 0.13 to 2.31 mg P g DW-1) and stocks (from 3.8 to 11.9 t C ha(-1); 96.3 to 400.6 kg N ha(-1), 3.6 to 44.3 kg P ha(-1)) were observed along the year (August 1993 - July 1994). Peaks in concentrations and stocks were observed in January, February and March 1994. As nutrient concentrations in water and sediments are low and stocks in the plant high, the local nutrient dynamics seem to be controlled by this macrophyte. Leaf blades and sheaths participate most in recycling, while stems contain the principal nutrient stock.

This study deals with the distribution of euglenoid morphospecies along the length of the Lower Parana River floodplain. Six sites located in the Parana River, Estevez stream and Montiel shallow lake were surveyed monthly from May 1995 to April 1996. 2. Eighty-eight infrageneric taxa were registered though the total density percentage of euglenoids seldom exceeded 15% of total phytoplankton. The increasing species richness towards the lake is mostly the result of a high contribution of species of Trachelomonas and naked infrageneric taxa of Euglena, Lepocinclis and Phacus, while the distribution of Strombomonas species along the transect is fairly constant. 3. The richness of euglenoid morphospecies follows a pattern opposite to that found for the entire phytoplankton community. The distribution of euglenoids differs among the three habitats defined in this study: river, stream, shallow lake. These differences depend on the hydraulic condition of each habitat, as revealed by canonical correspondence analysis. 4. The degree of association with each type of aquatic habitat varied among the species and differed between water phases. Strombomonas fluviatilis was equally constant along the length of the ecotone, while S. girardiana and S. scabra were particularly associated with the Parana River and P. longicauda, L. truncata, T. hispida and T. similis with the lake. 5. The flood pulse establishes a clear pattern both in species richness and abundance of euglenoids. The number of species recorded during high water was more than twice that recorded during low water.

There are no clear differences between the two waters with respect to calanoid copepods, but they differ appreciably in terms of rotifer biomass. In the more eutrophic water the latter show a pronounced mass development in July which is absent in the less eutrophic water. It is concluded that bacterio-detrivorous rotifer species are an important regulative factor of the ecosystem which compensates for productivity increases by intensifying heterotrophic destruction.																			0020-9309						1991	76	3					397	404		10.1002/iroh.19910760312	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19910760312													WOS:A1991GR32500010

The most common species were Rhipicephalus appendiculatus Neumann and Amblyomma variegatum F.; Boophilus decoloratus Koch and Rhipicephalus evertsi evertsi Neumann also were present in fewer numbers. Cattle were ranked according to their degree of resistance to each of the four species and to each stage in the life cycle of the three-host ticks. Ranking according to infestations of females and nymphs of R. appendiculatus, nymphs and larvae of A. variegatum, or all three stages of these two species when compared with the total burden gave statistically significant correlations. Sampling difficulties prevented the ranking of cattle for infestations of larvae of R. appendiculatus, although the numbers on cattle were high. On the other hand, failure of attempts to rank the cattle on females of A. variegatum, B. decoloratus, or R. e. evertsi counts was attributed to the small differences between tick numbers on cattle. Highly resistant cattle showed little or no seasonal fluctuations in tick numbers for most of the period compared with animals of low resistance, which showed an up to sevenfold increase in the magnitude of the tick burden when the tick challenge was high. Cattle with low resistance were responsible for much of the tick multiplication in the field, whereas highly resistant animals tended to limit the populations. There were no distinct differences between the numbers of each tick species on yearlings and mature cattle.

This paper, through a case study of the Mud Creek Irrigation District in the Saginaw Bay basin, Michigan, evaluates the potential hydrologic effects of withdrawing water for agricultural irrigation to the Great Lakes.

The simulated results indicate that an additional 70-120 mm of water would be evapotranspirated during the growing season from irrigated crop fields as compared to nonirrigated identical plantings. Dependent upon the magnitude of irrigation expansion, an equivalent of about 1 to 5 mm of water from Lakes Huron-Michigan could be lost to the atmosphere. If agricultural irrigation further expands in the entire Great Lakes basin, the aggregated potential of water loss to the atmosphere through ET from all five Great Lakes would be even greater.

Lipid acquisition and retention in tissues of spawning adult paddlefish Polyodon spathula (Walbaum, 1792) in relation to extended and compressed life history patterns in two river-reservoir systems	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												Data from recreationally caught adult paddlefish from North Dakota and Oklahoma, USA, was used in an initial attempt to explain variation in lipid content in adult wild paddlefish Polyodon spathula (Walbaum, 1792) by stock and by sex. The objectives of this study were to describe the relative importance of three distinct paddlefish tissues [white muscle, red muscle, and gonadal fat body (GFB)] for lipid storage, and compare lipid content of these tissues between stock and sex. It was hypothesized that lipid content of the three tissue types would be related to each other within individual fish; and that, consistent with previously documented life history differences, lipid concentrations for all tissues would be sex- and stock-specific. Paddlefish were sampled in April and May 2012 from the Grand Lake, Oklahoma, USA (GL) and Yellowstone-Sakakawea, North Dakota (SAK) stocks. Three tissue types were collected from SAK fish, including white muscle (N=137; 83M, 54F), red muscle (N=74; 36M, 38F), and GFB (N=164; 105M, 59F). Samples from GL fish included white muscle (N=60; 36M, 24F), and GFB (N=42; 41M, 1F). Proximate analysis was used to quantify the percentage of lipid, water, ash, and protein in tissue samples. The lipid component of proximate analysis was completed using the ANKOM method of lipid extraction which uses heated petroleum ether to extract lipid. Also investigated were lipid accumulation and storage in adult paddlefish in relation to tissue type: white muscle, red muscle, gonadal fat bodies (GFB) within individual fish, between the sexes, and between the two different stocks. White muscle was significantly correlated with both red muscle and GFB lipid, but red muscle lipid was not significantly correlated with GFB lipid. White muscle lipid content differed by stock and sex, with the more northerly stock having higher lipid content than the more southerly stock. Females had higher white muscle lipid content (SAK F=17.18, M=9.09; GL F=6.74, M=4.99) and red muscle (SAK F=47.72, M=30.93) than males. In contrast, GFB lipid differed by sex but not stock, with females having lower lipid content (SAK=79.79, GL=89.08) than males (SAK=89.08; GL=91.72). Life history differences, growing season, and the role of metabolism may help explain the differences in concentrations of lipids observed between stocks and between the sexes for all three tissues. It was hypothesized that different tissues may be used for different metabolic processes and that although metabolism likely strongly influences muscle tissue lipid, GFB lipid is probably linked more closely to reproductive demands associated with gonad development.																			0175-8659	1439-0426				FEB	2018	34	1					42	48		10.1111/jai.13580	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jai.13580													WOS:000419927100007

Effects of food availability and habitat features on the Ephemeroptera species composition at seasonal and spatial scales from neotropical floodplain rivers	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY												Brazilian floodplains have suffered great changes in their natural characteristics in recent decades, mainly in the flood pulse. The Upper Parana River floodplain is one of the few places where are found remained areas in which such peculiar characteristics keep reflecting on its high biodiversity. Ephemeroptera nymphs are one of the higher density groups among benthic community, occurring in many water bodies like large rivers and secondary channels. We sought to understand which factors are needed for the species establishment and how much important is the species colonization, especially in environments with anthropogenic changes. The marginal areas, which are more structured with presence of macrophytes, showed the highest density and richness even in the Parana River that has great human impact. We verified dominance of Americabaetis alphus, Tricorythopsis araponga, Tricorythopsis artigas on the Parana River, correlated with transparency, depth and electric conductivity, while the dominance of Traverella sp. was correlated with water temperature, especially in marginal areas. Consequently, the increasing transparency and electric conductivity due to the Porto Primavera dam in Parana River can be favoring those Ephemeroptera species. We demonstrated the importance of preserving the wetlands of Ivinhema River State Park mainly for Guajirolus sp., which was only registered in this region. Therefore, our study provides support for understanding gaps from previously studies using artificial substrates in three large rivers which are of great importance to the upper Parana River floodplain.					takeda, alice/GVT-2725-2022														1519-6984	1678-4375				FEB	2018	78	1					160	168		10.1590/1519-6984.168636	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/1519-6984.168636								29069163					WOS:000426370900023

The population variation of U. penicillatus was investigated in 504 bivalves during the period from August 2013 to July 2014 in Poyang Lake, East China. The results indicated that the overall prevalence and abundance of U. penicillatus was 9.52% and 1.58 +/- 10.38. The highest prevalence was 58.70% in September. The highest abundance levels were observed when the length of bivalves was in 220-300 mm. The number of U. penicillatus in a host was not correlated with the sex of bivalves. The outer and inner gills of bivalves were the preferred sites of U. penicillatus.																			1362-1971					FEB	2018	23	2					288	295		10.11158/saa.23.2.5	http://dx.doi.org/10.11158/saa.23.2.5													WOS:000425770900005

Analysis of the 123 profiles and associated phytoplankton productivity and nutrient data identified 3 important processes in the formation and dynamics of the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM): turbulent diffusion, nutrient supply rate and light availability. Seasonal variation in these 3 processes resulted in 3 regimes: a diffusion-dominated regime with a weak DCM, a variable-mixing regime with a pronounced, nutrient supply-dominated DCM and a stable regime with a deep, moderate light availability-dominated DCM. The transition between the 1st 2 regimes occurred in about 10 days, the transition between the last 2 more gradually over .apprx. 3 wk. The degree of spatial variability of the DCM was highest in the 2nd regime and lowest in the 3rd. The DCM in Lake Tahoe is constant in neither time nor space.

A dramatic decrease of the catch of Oreochromis niloticus (350 T y-1 in the fifties vs 30 T y-1 in 1982) suggested a loss of productivity or overfishing. In the same period, other ecological changes occurred: the submerged macrophytes regressed and there was a decrease in Secchi depth (0.65 m in 1987 vs 1.5 m in the fifties). Compared to other lakes of the same area, the plankton production seemed low. The results of the present study characterize lake Muhazi as a shallow lake with a rather unstable diurnal stratification and with slight differences in mixing regime between its eastern, deepest part and its western, shallowest part. Secchi disk depth does not vary seasonally to a large extent. The water has a rather high mineral content (conductivity of about 500 muS cm-1 at 25-degrees-C) and low concentrations of dissolved N and P, except in the hypolimnion, where NH4+-N can be high. Two species, Microcystis aeruginosa and Ceratium hirundinella, account for most of the phytoplankton biomass, which is about 50-80 mg chlorophyll a m-2 in the euphotic zone, usually with little seasonal variation. Daily gross production estimates amount to about 6 to 9.5 g O2 m-2 d-1 with a significant difference between the two parts of the lake. Data on C:N and C:P ratio in the phytoplankton suggest that some N deficiency might occur in the eastern part. Moreover, the Zm:Zc ratio could also lead to rather low net production rates (0.21-0.25 d-1 for a mixed layer of 4 m) In conclusion, the primary production of lake Muhazi is medium for African lakes and the hypothesis that decreased planktonic production could account for a reduced fish production should be discarded. Whereas the present yield of the fishery is only 20 kg ha-1 y-1, the yield estimated from primary production ranges between 46 and 64 kg ha-1 y-1. This could be reached through proper management. Finally, some hypotheses are given to explain the ecological changes which occurred in the lake.					; Plisnier, Pierre-Denis/ABG-2933-2020	Descy, Jean-Pierre/0000-0003-1649-7800; 													0018-8158					APR 26	1993	257	2					107	120		10.1007/BF00005951	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00005951													WOS:A1993LE26800005
J	PIERCE, HG				PIERCE, HG			THE NONMARINE MOLLUSKS OF THE LATE OLIGOCENE-EARLY MIOCENE CABBAGE PATCH FAUNA OF WESTERN MONTANA .3. AQUATIC MOLLUSKS AND CONCLUSIONS	JOURNAL OF PALEONTOLOGY												The aquatic molluscan fauna of the late Oligocene-early Miocene Cabbage Patch beds of western Montana includes eight taxa, six of which are new at specific or subspecific level, Sphaerium bakeri, Valvata paula, Planorbula powelli, Biomphalaria haydeni, Lymnaea tumere, and Lymnaea vetusta ambigua. Two are referred to previously known taxa, Viviparus nanus and Lymnaea shumardi. The genera Biomphalaria, Planorbula, and Viviparus no longer occur in western Montana, nor in the Columbia River drainage. Planorbula powelli is the earliest unequivocal Planorbula from North America. Of the 18 supraspecific taxa of this molluscan fauna, eight (44%) are now displaced, all but one to the east and/or south. Climatic interpretations derived from modern habitats of the genera Biomphalaria and Polygyroidea suggest a late Oligocene-early Miocene Mean Annual Temperature of 10 degrees C, with January means not less than 5 degrees C, and July means about 15 degrees C. Environmental analysis suggests a subhumid to subhumid shrub and grassland vegetation similar to modern environments with >50 cm Mean Annual Precipitation, surrounding marshy shallow lakes subject to seasonal desiccation. Effective moisture varied from slightly greater than the present for the late Oligocene to a latest Oligocene pluvial interval followed by subarid conditions for the early Miocene. Geographically, the drainage of this area was into a closed and isolated basin during the late Oligocene-early Miocene. Molluscan assemblages are found to support the tripartite division of the Cabbage Patch beds that has been based on mammals and should be useful in correlation between basins.																			0022-3360					NOV	1993	67	6					980	993		10.1017/S0022336000025294	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022336000025294													WOS:A1993ML94800010

Except for dramatic zooplankton responses to fertilization, the lakes had relatively simple and stable seasonal biomas patterns, with midsummer zooplankton peaks and no clear seasonal cycles in biomass of unicellular phytoplankton. Simple models predict that equilibrium biomasses should follow the observed pattern, provided zooplankton grazing and metabolic rates are temperature independent; experimental measurments of these rates did not show clear temperature edependence. Enclosure studies showed that phytoplankton biomass can return quickly (48-72 h) to equilibrium after disturbance, but zooplankton biomass responds more slowly (2- to 3-wk recovery times), yet fast enough to track a seasonally varying equilibrium. We conclude that the biomass equilibrium of unicellular phytoplankton is set by grazing and metabolic rates of zooplankton, while the zooplankton biomass equilibrium is set by phytoplankton productivity.

One of three rimes sampled was an artificial rime constructed as habitat restoration in an area previously dredged of gravel. Canonical correspondence analysis demonstrated differences between rime and pool fish assemblages, and indicated seasonal assemblage variation with no influence imparted by the artificial rime. Current speed, water depth, substrate character, total alkalinity, and season explained most assemblage variation. Fish assemblages were similar spatially, but, were seasonally variable. Rime fish assemblages exhibited more seasonal variability than did those of pools; 59% of the total number of fishes captured in rimes were seasonally variable compared to 12% in pools. Patterns of variability in this mitigated stream reach were similar to those reported for natural streams.																			0038-4909	1943-6262				SEP	1996	41	3					299	306																WOS:A1996WT89300013

Fences were placed up to 200 m from the shore and yielded a total of 1443 efts. Age was estimated by skeletochronology. More than 1200 efts (modal SVL 20 mm, age 0+, 1, and 2 yr) were caught while migrating toward the forest; most (83%) were caught in fences < 15 m from shore between 7 and 30 September. Efts migrating toward the lake (N = 226) were more frequent in June (39.4%) and August (37.6%). Those from three fences nearest shore (< 87 m) were maturing efts (modal SVL 32 mm; age 3-5 yr). Age and SVL were highly correlated in the eft population. Fence distance from shore and the interaction of this factor with fence side accounted for a significant portion of eft body size variation. Results suggest that maturing efts may need more than one season to migrate from terrestrial home range to spawning lake. Reduced migration during midsummer may be the result of adverse conditions on the forest floor. We estimated the median number of breeding seasons (2.5) in the study population by comparing age structure of the maturing eft population with that of adults in the nearby lake.																			0022-1511					MAR	2005	39	1					51	57		10.1670/0022-1511(2005)039[0051:SAAOME]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1670/0022-1511(2005)039[0051:SAAOME]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000228053200006

J	Fox, AM; Haller, WT				Fox, AM; Haller, WT			Production and survivorship of the functional stolons of giant cutgrass, Zizaniopsis miliacea (Poaceae)	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Giant cutgrass [Zizaniopsis miliacea], a tall emergent grass native to the southeastern United States, was studied in two Florida lakes. In Lake Seminole (15176 ha) giant cutgrass forms large expanding stands, but in Lake Alice (9 ha) it IS confined to a stable narrow fringe. By monitoring individual plants in Lake Seminole, it was found that an average decumbent flowering stem produced three flowers and ten nodes, 80% of which became rooted in the substrate. Such flowering stem development could potentially result in stand expansion of 2.2-2.7 m/yr, depending upon water levels and rates of node rooting. Once flowering stems became decumbent in Lake Alice, they typically broke, producing no more than two flowers with four nodes in a growing season. While still attached to the parent plant, few of these nodes were able to become rooted in the substrate, limiting the rate of stand expansion in Lake Alice. Sections of flowering stems bearing axillary shoots that were detached from the parent plant and free-floating could become rooted on reaching shallow water and produce robust, new, flowering plants. This interesting mode of population dispersal and spread has important implications for the distribution and management of giant cutgrass.

Within these aggregations, male R. virgatipes positioned themselves closer to conspecific than heterospecific males.

The study site was an uneven-aged, mature northern tolerant hardwoods dominated by sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) within the Turkey Lakes Watershed, Ontario. Six ions were investigated: nitrate (NO3-), sulfate (SO42-), calcium (Ca2), magnesium (Mg2+), potassium (K+), and ammonium (NH4+). Nitrate concentrations in the soil solution depended on season during the nonfoliage period and responded directly to forest floor percolation, soil water content, and season during the foliage period. Variations of SO42-, Ca2+, and Mg2+ concentrations were mostly attributable to NO3- concentration, and to season to a lesser extent. Concentrations of K+ and NH4+ correlated only weakly to any of the ''independent'' variables included in the analysis, reflecting a high affinity between these ions and the soil colloids.																			0045-5067					APR	1993	23	4					617	624		10.1139/x93-082	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x93-082													WOS:A1993LF59500008

Phytoplankton biomass averages 586-mu-g l-1 with the Diatomae and Chrysophyceae predominating. Zooplankton biomass averages 663-mu-g l-1 with small bosminid Cladocera being the most abundant organisms. Lake St. Clair zooplankton biomass is second only to that of Lake Erie amongst the St. Lawrence Great Lakes. Biomass size spectra are typical in structure for mesotrophic lakes but low explained variance in the annual normalized spectrum is indicative of a perturbed system. Since 1972/1973 there appears to have been a slight decrease in zooplankton abundance in the lake accompanied by a shift from dominance of rotifers to dominance of cladocerans. We hypothesize that high flushing rate and seasonal variability coupled with contaminant loadings have resulted in a plankton community reduced in taxonomic diversity and dominated by small-bodied species.																			0018-8158					JUL 26	1991	219						229	237		10.1007/BF00024757	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00024757													WOS:A1991GK03100015

Some of the evaporation pans were implemented with freshwater aquatic macrophytes (Myriophyllum sp., Potamogeton sp., and Najas sp.) (P-s) and sediment covered bottom (S). The applied macrophytes were the predominant species of Keszthely Bay (Balaton Lake). Reference (E-o) after Shuttleworth and reference evapotranspiration (ETo) after Penman-Monteith (FAO-56 formula) were also included for the E study. Of pre-selected four investigated variables, air temperature and air humidity impacted E-p of treated Class A pans the most. Cumulative E-p values for 2016 were 363.1, 427.7, and 461.5 mm in C, S, and Ps, respectively. There was no difference in measured cumulative E-p of P-s (461.5 mm) and computed ETo (472.1 mm) during the studied season. On the basis of a simplified water budget, E rate of Keszthely Bay increased with 16.9%, when macrophytes and sediment cover were accounted. It is equivalent to 264,000,000 m(3) water in Keszthely Bay's E estimation. Simple E approach - when lake's components, such as submerged macrophytes and sediment cover were also accounted - could extend the accuracy of natural lake's E estimation in a broader circle than earlier.

The comparison between the real data and the numerical results and its assessment based on time and temperature dependences in control points, correspondence of the forms of the profiles and standard deviation for all performed realizations are provided. It is demonstrated that the model reproduces the results of field measurement data for all observed conditions and seasons. The numerical results for the regimes with strong mixing are in the best quantitative and qualitative agreement with the real profiles. The accuracy of the forecast for the ones with strong stratification near the surface is lower but all specificities of the forms are correctly reproduced.

Ecotoxicological status and prognosis of the state of an urbanized hydroecosystem (on the example of the reservoir "Ternopil pond")	JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY GEOGRAPHY AND GEOECOLOGY												As a result of a complex hydroecological research on the reservoir "Temopil Pond"and comparison of these data with environmental and quality water standards we assessed the environmental threat posed by the content of certain substances, and the ecotoxicological state of the pond in general. A high concentration of HCO3- was found, but the critical factor of water pollution is the significant concentration of ammonia, as well as the excess over the permissible levels of sodium ions. Moreover, we found polymetallic contamination of the bottom sediments with a high ratio of biologically dangerous mobile forms, with the exception of iron, and the excess over permissible levels (MPS), which in some places was ten times higher than the norm. The high level of the content of mobile metals forms was found at sampling areas with a considerable sedimentation.The content of the mobile form of copper exceeded the norm by 24-86 times, nickel - from 2 to 17 times, cobalt - 4-8 times. The content of the mobile form of cadmium exceeded the permissible norm by 5-80 times, and lead - by 4.5-12 times. It was established that the content of the metals of the essential group in the water of the reservoir was below the permissible values, and in the places where active flushing waters are flowing high concentrations of copper was found. Among the nonessential metals, cadmium and lead were found with fairly high cadmium content , which is biologically dangerous because of the toxicity of this metal. In case of changes in the hydrochemical balance, the mobility of metals may increase, which will substantially worsen the almost disastrous pollution of the reservoir with highly toxic and biologically hazardous metals.Economic-mathematical modeling and statistical methods based on correlation-regression analysis using Matlab software were used to investigate the influence of ammonium content on the water pH index. The correlation index is ststistically significant and amounts to 0.86. This research will allow us to predict pH index of the water depending on the content of ammonium. The calculated elasticity coefficient shows that with an increase in ammonia by 10%, the pH index of the water will vary by 8%. In order to study the environmental situation in the near future, namely the content of metals in the bottom sediments, a forecast of the content of such metals as magnesium and cobaltfor the next two seasonal periods according to the theory of Markov chains has been made. This theory allows us to make predictions of the factor, taking into account the possibility of random effects on the environment, and investigates the greatest probability of presence of a factor in a certain numerical parameter.

Considering that it is cold, dry and seasonally dark, the usual environmental processes affecting distribution or accumulation of contaminants is clearly different. However, since the late 1980s, various investigators have found that contamination levels of industrial and agricultural chemicals are sometimes very high in the Arctic. In some cases, the contaminants have traveled to the Arctic through the atmosphere as gasses or associated with particles in a process known as long-range atmospheric transport, or LRAT. These contaminants may be deposited on glaciers or ocean surfaces and in the case of the latter, will enter the food chain, including humans who rely on wild sources of food from the marine environment. In other cases, contaminants may arrive in the Arctic through imported construction or other materials. In the case of energy production, the emissions are the same as in any populated place. Here we discuss the early history of contamination in the Arctic and the more recent sampling, analysis and results of different environmental chemistry campaigns in the Arctic. Resident university students have been involved in sampling and data gathering for the analysis of atmospheric mercury released from coal combustion, and the apparent emissions of various flame retardants into the atmosphere from local building materials or LRAT. The site is in Longyearbyen, on Svalbard, which was organized as a coal-mining town in 1906, and continues to operate today as a tourist site with a small university offering courses relevant to the Arctic. Electricity has been generated in Longyeaarbyen by coal combustion for about 100 years, and the effect during sampling in 2016 showed a daily atmospheric mercury cycle, with an average concentration similar to "European polluted air", and average air in Detroit, USA. Our investigation of flame retardants showed that the organophosphorus flame retardants (OPFRs), considered to be replacements for now-banned brominated flame retardants (BFRs), have a concentration similar to non-urban areas in the U.S. Great Lakes region. The average content of the OPFRs was at least one order of magnitude greater than the BFRs. Using an Arctic community for investigations of environmental chemistry leaves students with a strong background about the impacts of urban and industrial pollution on the Arctic environment, demonstrating that the Arctic is part of the global contaminant distribution system, and is not "pristine".

Mesozooplankton of the Kosi Bay lakes, South Africa	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												The Kosi coastal lake system, a chain of four interconnected basins, is located in the subtropical north-eastern corner of South Africa. Little information is available on zooplankton of the system and the main aim of this study is to report on zooplankton samples collected during 2002 and 2003. The set of samples consists of seasonal, subsurface mesozooplankton samples that were collected during nighttime in each of the lakes. A well-developed salinity gradient was evident along the interconnected lakes in the subsurface water during all seasons, ranging from freshwater in the upper lake Amanzamnyama to a maximum of 22 recorded in Lake Makhawulani. The zooplankton community structures of the lakes reflected the salinity gradient of the system, with some coastal marine taxa recorded in the lakes closer to the mouth and only freshwater taxa recorded in Lake Amanzamnyama. Mesozooplankton diversity and abundance were relatively low compared to other estuarine systems along the eastern coast of South Africa. The dominant taxa were calanoid copepods Acartiella natalensis and Pseudodiaptomus stuhlmanni and the mysid Mesopodopsis africana in the lower lakes, whereas cyclopoids Mesocyclops sp. and Thermocyclops sp. dominated the freshwater lake Amanzamnyama.

Ontogeny of Lobelia dortmanna genets in lake ecosystems	REGULATORY MECHANISMS IN BIOSYSTEMS												Lobelia dortmanna L. is one of the few rare, slowly growing relic plants occupying areas of the littoral zone of water bodies with low nutrient content and subject to wave action. Even in such difficult conditions, this plant successfully passes its entire life cycle, actively blossoms and fruits. That is why the peculiar features of the individual development of this plant in various geographical conditions is a matter of great interest For the first time, this study considers in detail the ontogeny of the genet of L. dortmanna in oligotrophic lakes of Tver oblast. Detailed characteristics of the following age stages of individuals are given: resting seeds, seedlings. juvenile, young and adult vegetative, latent generative, middle-aged and old generative and quasisenile plants. It is shown that the transition to the juvenile age stage occurs at the end of the first year of life, the virginile age stage lasts two years, and the generative stage of development occurs in the fourth year of life. The change in the growth pattern of the rosette main shoot of Lobelia, from orthotropic to anisotropic, occurs in the second year of life. The establishment and further development of the generative organs of the plant and associated change in the growth of the main shoot from monopodial to simpodial occurs in the fourth year of life. At the same time, the branching of the main shoot begins by formation in the axils of the uppermost assimilating leaves (the last in front of the apical inflorescence) - 1-2 lateral rosette shoots. These are future ramets (vegetative diasporas), which ensure, in the future. the vegetative reproduction of the individual and spread to new territories. Taking into account that in lakes of Tver oblast, Lobelia groupings form dense aggregated clusters on the bottom, the transition of individuals to a quasisenile age state (in the fifth year of life) enables them to rejuvenate and survive after the death of the maternal shoot The formation and further development of rosette lateral shoots allows the plant to re-occupy the territory via vegetative or seed propagation. Complete morphological disintegration (vegetative reproduction) occurs in the fifth year of life. The gaiets' ontogeny is completed by the formation of a compact clone from the detached lateral rosette shoots.

The study of factors that causes disruption to the aquatic environment are fundamental for discussions and actions related to its conservation. The objective of this work is to do a research about the geoenvironmental factors that inflict directly to the water from the Igarape Agua Boa do Bom Intento. The geoenvironmental characteristics show that the Igarape basin presents four types of soils, predominating the Yellow Argisol and the Yellow Latosol with a small spot of Argisol and Fluid Neosols, are fragile soils and poor chemically. The relief is flat to slightly undulating with the presence of lakes in times of greater intensity of rains. The climate is tropical Awi type monsoon, with high average annual temperatures of 26 degrees C and sharp dry season with peak between December and March and the period of rains that between the months of April to September. The savanna system is classified in Savana Park - Sp, Graminaceous or Gramineous - Lenhosa - Sg, and others such as Mata Island.																			2178-0463					JAN-APR	2018	9	17																						WOS:000437953000001

The aims of this study were: i) to investigate the effect of flood pulse and lateral connectivity on Loricariidae assemblages in oxbow lakes; and ii) to determine the environmental factors driving the local structure of these species in the northern portion of the Pantanal. For this purpose, the fish community was sampled in two oxbow lakes between September 2005 and August 2007. The assemblages were mainly affected by seasonal fluctuations and were spatially unstructured, demonstrating that the flood pulse has a predominant role in the structuring of Loricariidae. In addition, the homogeneity of the assemblages between the lakes pointed to a frequent movement of the fish among the different subsystems, suggesting a high level of interaction and mixing between the habitats along the floodplain. The flood pulse was also responsible for significant changes in depth, dissolved oxygen and turbidity along the seasons, factors driving the structure of the fish assemblages. It was evident that seasonal environmental changes and connectivity are significant in the structure of Loricariidae assemblages in the Pantanal, sustaining high diversity and abundance.

The paper proposes a methodology of geophysical investigations for the identification of water escape zones from a retention fresh water lake (low mineralised water). The study was performed in a lake reservoir in Upper Silesia. Since a number of years the administrators of the lake have observed a decreasing water level, a phenomenon that is not related to the exploitation of the object. The analysed retention lake has a maximal depth between 6 and 10 m, depending on the season. It is located on Triassic carbonate rocks of the Muschelkalk facies. Geophysical surveys included measurements on the water surface using ground penetration radar (GPR) and electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) methods. The measurements were performed from watercrafts made of non-metal materials. The prospection reached a depth of about 1 to 5 m below the reservoir bottom. Due to large difficulties of conducting investigations in the lake, a fragment with an area of about 5,300 m(2), where service activities and sealing works were already commenced, was selected for the geophysical survey. The scope of this work was: (1) field geophysical research (Ground-Penetrating Radar GPR and Electrical Resistivity Tomography ERT with geodesic service), (2) processing of the obtained geophysical research results, (3) modelling of GPR and ERT anomalies on a fractured water reservoir bottom, and (4) interpretation of the obtained results based on the modelled geophysical anomalies. The geophysical surveys allowed for distinguishing a one with anomalous physical parameters in the area of the analysed part of the retention lake. ERT surveys have shown that the water escape zone from the reservoir was characterised by significantly decreased electrical resistivities. Diffraction hyperboles and a zone of wave attenuation were observed on the GPR images in the lake bottom within the water escape zone indicating cracks in the bottom of the water reservoir. The proposed methodology of geophysical surveys seems effective in solving untypical issues such as measurements on the water surface.					; Popielski, Pawel/F-9032-2019	Mieszkowski, Radoslaw/0000-0002-4021-4965; wojcik, Emilia/0000-0001-6872-1734; Popielski, Pawel/0000-0002-5425-5821													1641-5558	2300-0384					2018	35	2					121	129		10.2478/squa-2018-0009	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/squa-2018-0009													WOS:000454623500004

The species is now listed as 'Critically Endangered' in the Red Data Book of Japan. Nevertheless, it remains subject to fishing without any specific management strategies. Previous studies using mitochondria) DNA markers showed that this fish species has two cryptic lineages. However, little is known about spatial genetic structure and ecological differences across the broad lakescape. In this study, we collected fish samples at nine locations along the lakeshore during the breeding season and tested for the presence of spatial heterogeneity in the lineage's composition while measuring body size as the most fundamental biological trait. The results showed that the major lineage dominated all the sampling locations whereas the minor lineage consisted of only 11% (16/143) of samples. Furthermore, although their spatial distributions overlapped (i.e. the two lineages may be well mixed), we found it possible that the minor lineage may have a potentially narrower distribution than the major lineage. In addition, we found that the two lineages differ in body size; specifically, the minor lineage is smaller in size. From the viewpoint of genetic diversity conservation and sustainable resource use, this fish should be managed as two genetic stocks and spatial and/or body size-based fishery management is desirable, with particular attention to the minor (smaller sized) lineage.

Diurnal time -activity budgets of adults and juveniles were monitored separately in randomly selected focal flocks during 1200 observation sessions in 8 different behaviour patterns: feeding, resting, walking, flying, preening, aggression, showing alarm and courting. Feeding was the most important activity with rates of 46 of the time in both adult and juvenile individuals and showed a negative relationship with the degree of disturbance. Main diurnal activities of the Greater Flamingos during the study were walking and resting. Time use did not differ significantly between adults and juveniles (P>0.05). But, juveniles spent more time feeding and less time walking than adults (P<0.05).																			1018-4619	1610-2304					2018	27	6					4220	4223																WOS:000437783100044

The studies were performed by Limnological Institute, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences (Irkutsk, Russia) in continuous monitoring mode. Peculiarities of seasonal and interannual variability of aerosol and precipitation ion content are analyzed. A reduction of aerosol ion concentrations is observed since 2000 to 2015, while no such reduction of ion concentrations is seen in precipitation. The mean annual pH value and nitrate content show a tendency to decrease with simultaneous growth of sulfate and ammonium concentrations. Aerosol ion content changed in 2010-2015 as compared to the 1990's. The change of aerosol and precipitation ion content is induced by climate change (warming, growing rain and snowfall) in the Baikal Region as well as by shift of heat and power plants emission components towards reduction of ash fraction and increase of acidulous gases.					obolkin, Vladimir/T-3884-2018; Golobokova, Liudmila/J-4361-2018														0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-2292-0				2018	10833								UNSP 108333T	10.1117/12.2503867	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2503867													WOS:000459714100135

Evolutionary history of Daphnia drives divergence in grazing selectivity and alters temporal community dynamics of producers	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Consumers with different seasonal life histories encounter different communities of producers during specific seasonal phases. If consumers evolve to prefer the producers that they encounter, then consumers may reciprocally influence the temporal composition of producer communities. Here, we study the keystone consumer Daphnia ambigua, whose seasonal life history has diverged due to intraspecific predator divergence across lakes of New England. We ask whether grazing preferences of Daphnia have diverged also and test whether any grazing differences influence temporal composition patterns of producers. We reared clonal populations of Daphnia from natural populations representing the two diverged life history types for multiple generations. We conducted short-term (24hr) and long-term (27days) grazing experiments in equal polycultures consisting of three diatom and two green algae species, treated with no consumer, Daphnia from lakes with anadromous alewife, or from lakes with landlocked alewife. After 24hr, life history and grazing preference divergence in Daphnia ambigua drove significant differences in producer composition. However, those differences disappeared at the end of the 27-day experiment. Our results illustrate that, despite potentially more complex long-term dynamics, a multitrophic cascade of evolutionary divergence from a predator can influence temporal community dynamics at the producer level.					; Post, David/A-6987-2009	Park, John/0000-0003-2151-1160; Post, David/0000-0003-1434-7729													2045-7758					JAN	2018	8	2					859	865		10.1002/ece3.3678	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.3678								29375760					WOS:000425822800004

Sediments in most Dongting Lake region inundated during wetting season exposed during drying season annually. In order to estimate the internal releases of N from the sediment inundated during wetting season, air-dried sediments collected in Eastern Dongting were covered by cycling water with velocities of 0.025-0.2 cm/s. During water cycling (60 days), total nitrogen (TN) in water column increased first, followed by ammonium (NH4+-N) and then nitrate (NO3--N). Exchangeable nitrogen (EN), hydrolysable nitrogen (HN), and non-hydrolysable nitrogen (NHN) in sediments declined during flow cycling. The EN decreased faster in sediments rewetted with higher velocity. The NHN in sediments transformed into HN, EN, free nitrogen (FN), and dissolved nitrogen in sequence. NH4+-N and NO3--N in sediments declined due to the increased coupled nitrification-denitrification rate in rewetted sediments. NH4+-N and NO3--N in sediments also transported into pore water. NH4+-N and NO3--N in the pore water diffused to water column. NH4+-N in water column also oxidized into NO3--N in this study.

The recent resurgence of Double-crested Cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) numbers, particularly in central and eastern Canada, has led to pressures for control to which provinces have responded in different ways. In Manitoba, with the largest numbers, fishermen are illegally killing thousands of birds. Ontario protects cormorants and views them as indicators tors of chemical pollution in the Great Lakes. Quebec is regulating a cull of breeding birds to protect island habitat. New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island have hunting seasons. Nova Scotia and Newfoundland give kill permits to individual fishermen. The federal government does research on cormorants, particularly to understand the effects of toxic chemicals on them.																			0738-6028						1995	18				1		234	237		10.2307/1521544	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1521544													WOS:A1995TM97000026

Effluent nitrogen loadings to Truckee River increased by about 6% yr-1, whereas phosphorus discharge beginning in 1982 was reduced 90% by phosphorus removal. Water discharged annually by Truckee River to Pyramid Lake varied widely among years, ranging from about 42 to 2420 m3 .times. 106. Anomalous regional precipitation patterns associated with strong El Nino-Southern Oscillation events resulted in below-average Truckee River discharge from 1977 to 1979, and above-average discharge from 1982 to 1986. Mass-transport of soluble reactive phosphorus to Pyramid Lake declined from 146 to 94 mm m-2 yr-1 after phosphorus removal, whereas total phosphorus loadings increased from 217 to 396 mg m-2 yr-1. There were no significant long-term trends in total nitrogen loadings to Pyramid Lake (mean: 1640 mg m-2 yr-1; range: 112-5500 mg m-2 yr-1), despite increases in effluent nitrogen loadings to Truckee River. Seasonal and annual fluctuations in fluvial discharge, changes in quantity and quality of effluent discharged to Truckee River and in-river biological uptake and transformations were responsible for the variability in in-stream nutrient concentrations and projected loadings to Pyramid Lake.																			0043-1354	1879-2448				AUG	1990	24	8					1031	1040		10.1016/0043-1354(90)90126-Q	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(90)90126-Q													WOS:A1990DX33200013

The Detection of Annual Hypoxia in a Low Latitude Freshwater Reservoir in Kerala, India, Using the Small AUV Maya	MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY JOURNAL												The Idukki Reservoir at an altitude of 748 m covering an area of 53 km(2) is surrounded by tropical forests in the Western Ghats in the southwestern Indian state of Kerala. We used the small autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) Maya with onboard sensors of dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll, turbidity, temperature, and depth to monitor the water quality environment of the Idukki Reservoir in May 2006. The use of AUVs in confined spaces like small lakes and reservoirs is new and uncommon, requiring extra safety to be implemented. As this is a prototype AUV, we shall describe in brief key aspects of the vehicle attributes namely, its novel mechanical design, the autopilots that control the heading and cruising depth, and the safety and endurance of the platform. The data acquired by Maya revealed an acute oxygen deficiency at 21 m, a mid-water low turbidity layer between 10 m and 15 m, and a prominent chlorophyll maximum in the thermocline region of Idukki waters at 6 m. These experiments were repeated a year later in May 2007 and were in unambiguouos agreement with the 2006 findings of hypoxia. These are the first observations of hypoxic processes using a small AUV in any Indian lake. The relevance of these results in freshwater systems shows similarities to hypoxia in saline coastal waters of the west coast of India and is discussed briefly.					; PASCOAL, ANTÓNIO/N-4791-2017; PASCOAL, ANTONIO/N-4791-2017	Nambiar, Manoj K./0000-0002-8026-3235; K.

J	LEMMIN, U				LEMMIN, U			THE STRUCTURE AND DYNAMICS OF INTERNAL WAVES IN BALDEGGERSEE	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Analysis of long records of temperature/depth distribution determined at 10- or 20-min intervals at several stations and extending over three stratification seasons, provides a detailed picture of the characteristics, dynamics, and seasonal variation in activity of internal waves in a small lake (Baldeggersee, Switzerland). Wind stress in general was low, with occasional bursts of higher energy. The ensuing, slightly damped internal seiches govern the dynamics of the stratified lake. The vertical structure displays a dominant response of the first vertical mode. Responses in the second vertical mode, hitherto rarely recorded, are also demonstrated with the help of spectral analysis and models. The horizontal structure of the seiches motion displays dominance and persistence of the fundamental basin mode. Spectral analysis also discloses responses of the second and third basin modes. Multiplying of the spectra with the local buoyancy frequency leads to a collapse of all spectra into a narrow band, pointing toward the possibility of a universal spectrum. New light is shed on apparently common examples of waveform asymmetry and on their interpretation. It is concluded that, in this small-basin, low-energy example, internal waves provide motions at all levels, but little vertical mixing.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	1987	32	1					43	61		10.4319/lo.1987.32.1.0043	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1987.32.1.0043													WOS:A1987G107200004

Each of the six communities was dominated by one native species (Myriophyllum triphyllum, Isoetes alpinus, Chara fibrosa var. acanthopitys or Chara globularis) or by the adventive Elodea canadensis. Thirteen of the 21 macroinvertebrate taxa associated with these communities were herbivores and/or detritivores and these contributed at least 90% of total abundance; the remaining eight were predators. The gastropod Potamopyrgus antipodarum was dominant in all communities; overall, gastropods (four species) contributed between 66 and 90% to total abundance. A few species showed a marked preference for certain communities. Seasonal changes in macroinvertebrate abundance and biomass are discussed and the results compared with those from other New Zealand lakes. Biomass data for all communities and the extent of the oscillations in biomass between years are consistent with the designation of mesotrophic status for Lake Alexandrina.																			0028-8330	1175-8805					1987	21	2					199	213		10.1080/00288330.1987.9516216	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1987.9516216													WOS:A1987M134600004

J	Jensen, JW; Nost, T; Muniz, IP				Jensen, JW; Nost, T; Muniz, IP			The ecology of brown trout and Arctic charr in two lakes in Hoylandet	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Food consumption, growth, fish length distributions, population sizes and habitat use of the salmonids in two lakes in the Hoylandet area were studied in 1986-89. The allopatric brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) in the tarn Royrtjonna (27 ha) fed mainly on organisms at the lake surface, crustacean plankton, Trichoptera and Chironomidae. Only 5% of the trout reached an age of 6 years and a length of 25 cm. Sexual maturation started at age 3 and a length of 14 cm. Through mark - recapture technique the number of trout >10 cm was estimated to 115 ha(-1). Growth, fish length frequencies and sexual maturation of the sympatric brown trout and Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus (L.)) in Lake Storgronningen (530 ha) were not much different. The Storgronningen charr fed chiefly on zooplankton which by volume represented 33% for the trout. The food consumption of Storgronningen trout was at maximum in July with 2.06 mg food (d.w.) per g live fish and for charr in September with 1.26 mg food. The maximum size-independent growth rate of trout was 5.2% day(-1) in late June, and for charr 4.1% day(-1) in late July. Seventy percent of their seasonal growth took place before 15 August. The charr stayed mainly deeper than 3-4 m, at water temperatures <15 degrees C. Brown trout stayed mainly the littoral zone and in near surface water of the pelagic. The number of pelagic charr was estimated hydroacustically to 50 ind. ha(-1). The charr spawn in the lake. Mean numbers of juvenile trout in the two largest tributaries were 26 and 48 per 100 m(2). Their annual length increment was 2.8-3.4 cm. No indication of acidification or other human induced impacts were found. The lakes and their tributaries represent complex aquatic systems, representative for pristine oligotrophic Norwegian lowland lakes.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				AUG 1	1997	348						127	143		10.1023/A:1003045402520	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003045402520													WOS:A1997XV67900010

PELAGIC BACTERIAL HETEROTROPHY AND BIOMASS	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Bacterial activities and abundance were measured seasonally in the water column of meromictic Big Soda Lake which is divided into three chemically distinct zones: aerobic mixolimnion, anaerobic mixolimnion, and anaerobic monimolimnion. Bacterial abundance ranged between 5 and 52 .times. 106 cells ml-1, with highest biomass at the interfaces between these zones: 2-4 mg C liter-1 in the photosynthetic bacterial layer (oxycline) and 0.8-2.0 mg C liter-1 in the chemocline. Bacterial cell size and morphology also varied with depth: small coccoid cells were dominant in the aerobic mixolimnion, whereas the monimolimnion had a more diverse populations that included cocci, rods, and large filaments. Heterotrophic activity was measured by [methyl-3H]thymidine incorporation and [14C]glutamate uptake. Higest uptake rates were at or just below the photosynthetic bacterial layer and were attributable to small (< 1 .mu.m) heterotrophs rather than the larger photosynthetic bacteria. These high rates of heterotrophic uptake were apparently linked with fermentation; rates of other mineralization processes (e.g. sulfate reduction, methanogenesis, denitrification) in the anoxic mixolimnion were insignificant. Heterotrophic activity in the highly reduced monimolimnion was generally much lower than elsewhere in the water column. Therefore, although the monimolimnion contained most of the bacterial abundance and biomass (.apprx. 60%), most of the cells there were inactive.					; Zehr, Jonathan/B-3513-2014; Cloern, James/C-1499-2011; Harvey, Ronald/C-5783-2013	Cloern, James/0000-0002-5880-6862; Zehr, Jonathan/0000-0002-5691-5408; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				JUL	1987	32	4					781	793		10.4319/lo.1987.32.4.0781	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1987.32.4.0781													WOS:A1987K372000001

These aspects were also studied in the laboratory, in open flow-through aquaria fed with media differing in pH, alkalinity and nitrogen and/or phosphorus concentrations. The loss in weight of the decomposing leaves was studied using litter bags. The organic matter composition of the particulate residues was characterized by Curie-point pyrolysis mass spectrometry. Higher weight-loss rates and faster changes in organic matter composition were observed in the warmer period of the year and under more eutrophic and/or alkaline conditions. In acid environments, the loss of structural carbohydrates from the decomposing plant material was small. In eutrophic and/or alkaline environments, lignin accumulated in the particulate residues, while cellulose and hemicellulose were apparently mineralized.																			0304-3770	1879-1522					1985	22	3-4					197	229		10.1016/0304-3770(85)90001-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(85)90001-4													WOS:A1985AUE0800001

Novel method for monitoring common terns at a large colony in northern Lake Huron, USA	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Novel monitoring and management techniques may be required when working with colonial waterbirds nesting on anthropogenic sites. We tested the utility of fixed sampling frames (quadrats) for estimating number of common tern (Sterna hirundo) nests and colony dynamics at a site in northern lake Huron, USA We also examined whether within-season herbaceous vegetation management affected number of nests. We were unable to detect any avoidance of fixed quadrats (N = 15) versus staked quadrats (N = 15) over 10 count days in 2015 (Mann Whitney, 0.16). Both distance from human disturbance (m) and Julian day were significant (P < 0.01) predictors of number of nests. Based on these findings and using quadrat data from peak count days each year from 2011 to 2016, we estimated a low of 1100 nests in 2013 and a high of 2000 nests in 2016. We also were unable to detect any differences in the number of nests in quadrats with vegetation treatments (N = 10) versus controls (N = 10) during 11 counts in 2016 (Mann-Whitney, 0.18). For common terns, and potentially other colonial waterbirds breeding on anthropogenic sites in the Great Lakes, we conclude that a fixed quadrat methodology may provide a useful way of estimating colony size and colony dynamics. Future studies should be conducted to compare our novel method with more traditional monitoring techniques.

Neutral Metal Complexes in Water Bodies of Different Types	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF GENERAL CHEMISTRY												The results of long-term studies on the contents and seasonal dynamics of neutral carbohydrate metal complexes in the surface water bodies of different types (lakes, rivers, reservoirs) are summarized. It is established that the weight fraction of the mentioned complexes characteristically varies significantly depending on the type of the water body and the component composition of dissolved organic substances. In water bodies with a highly colored water, the relative contents of dissolved metals in neutral complexes are low due to their preferential binding to anionic complexes with humic substances. In small eutrophic water bodies with a relatively low content of humic substances, the carbohydrate concentrations are the highest and, accordingly, the weight fractions of metals in their neutral complexes is also very noticeable. The molecular weight distributions of neutral metal complexes are discussed. The neutral complexes with the molecular weight <= 5.0 kDa form a significant part of metals associated with carbohydrates. The seasonal dynamics of these metal complexes are discussed.

Each column had received a cap of litter-humus from either a jack pine or mixed hardwood stand, or a quartz sand (control) and was preconditioned by treatment with rainwater acidified to pH 5.4 or 4.2, applied weekly throughout the growing season for four years. C-14-labeled material was added to the commercial formulation of each product and applied at 2.24 kg (active ingredient [a.i.])/ha of hexazinone and tebuthiuron and 42.5 g (a.i.)/ha of sulfometuron methyl. Acidified rainwater was applied weekly to approximate ambient precipitation; additional water was applied on three occasions. Soil water was sampled once at 10, 20, and 40 cm, and 10 times at the 150-cm level over the 130-d post-treatment. Sulfometuron methyl apparently had dissipated by 80 d post-treatment and was not detected below 20 cm. At the 150-cm level, hexazinone and tebuthiuron were detected in leachate beginning 52 and 66 d post-treatment, respectively. Leaching of both products was affected significantly by litter-humus treatment; by amount of applied rainwater, and for tebuthiuron, by site. The lack of a humus cover increased the amount of hexazinone at 150 cm by nearly threefold and tebuthiuron by nearly fivefold. The greatest leaching occurred after high applications of water and on the four sites with the lowest pH and base saturation. The combination of soil characteristics, litter-humus treatments, and applied precipitation provides reference values for worst-case conditions likely to be encountered in the Lake states region.																			0730-7268	1552-8618				MAR	1993	12	3					399	404		10.1002/etc.5620120302	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/etc.5620120302													WOS:A1993KQ42700002

Seven species appeared in large numbers in the plankton seasonally. Brachionus and Keratella species made up more than 50% of the rotifer community by numbers during the observation period (1983-1987). The standing stock numbers of rotifer species are low with a maximum of 50 individuals L-1, and some possible reasons for this observation are discussed. Most rotifer species are distributed randomly in the lake and show 3-fold fluctuations between consecutive days. The seasonal dynamics of most rotifer species are correlated with mixing periods in the lake, and the amplitude of seasonal fluctuation may be as high as 50-fold. Clear-cut seasonal succession of rotifer species was observed during the study period, but no consistent seasonal pattern for individual species was obvious. Also, observations indicate that rotifer biomass is partly sustained by availability of carbon through the bacterial pathway and that competitive exclusion for food by nauplii and ciliates probably keeps rotifer abundance low.																			0018-8158					FEB 15	1991	209	3					203	214		10.1007/BF00015343	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00015343													WOS:A1991FA88800004

Pleopodal egg counts directly after laboratory spawning were on average 81% of ovarian counts; in the field, an estimated 50 days after spawning, they were only 61% of estimated ovarian egg numbers. 5. Average ovarian egg size was positively correlated with female size. Also, larger crayfish had a wider range of egg sizes than smaller crayfish. 6.

Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations decreased landward as a negative linear function of salinity. Thermodynamic modelling and the absence of CaCO3 in the sediments indicate that this loss of DIC was not due to calcite precipitation in the main water body. The innermost, almost landlocked, waters contained high phytoplankton biomass (50-300 mu g chi l(-1)) and high concentrations of allochthonous dissolved organic carbon. Photosynthetic uptake of DIC and subsequent particulate organic carbon sedimentation is proposed as hypothetical explanation of the relationship between DIC and salinity; localized overheating in shallow waters might also be involved.																			0160-8347					SEP	1995	18	3					456	468		10.2307/1352364	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1352364													WOS:A1995RV91300003

Because of the dense population and low yield, lots of floodplain was reclaimed as farmland in recent hundreds of years. But after experiencing the tremendous flood disaster in the middle reaches of Yangzte River in 1998, wetlands restoration policy was soon proposed by the central government and implemented by the provinces in middle Yangtze. Poyang Lake is the largest freshwater lake in China. It lies in Jiangxi Province and is one of the key areas of wetlands restoration in middle Yangzte. Landsat TM/ETM images from 1998 to 2004 were used to monitor the area of wetlands restoration and assess its achievements around Poyang Lake in this paper. The result of wetlands restoration can be divided into tivo types: complete restoration and semirestoration. The former type is returning farmland to lake completely, while the latter is Just let farmers move away from the floodplain, the farmland was returned into lake only in flood season and can also be reaped in non-flood seasons. It Is testified that only 20 percents of the whole restoration area were the complete restoration, and about 80 percents of the wetlands restoration were semi-restoration around Poyang Lake.

Eight fingerponds were set up in two Cyperus papyrus L - dominated wetlands in Walukuba and Gaba on the northern shores of Lake Victoria, Uganda. The ponds were stocked with fish during the March - May rainy season by connecting the ponds to the take using a small channel. The dominant fish that stocked the ponds were tilapia (mainly Oreochromis spp.). A water quality assessment for the wetlands covering the dry and wet seasons showed that the environment was suitable for fish survival with some variation between seasons. A stable temporal and spatial variation was found in the newly established ponds with ranges for pH values (5.2-9.0), temperature (21.0-28.5 degrees C), dissolved oxygen (4.4-11.9 mg L-1) and total ammonium nitrogen (0.54-0.94 mg L-1). A remarkable difference was noted in water transparency between the sites with mean values of 37 cm in Walukuba and 15 cm in Gaba. Four phyla of phytoplankton: Cyanophyta, Chlorophyta, Euglenophyta and Chrysophyta colonized the ponds with Cyanophyta as dominant in Walukuba. The newly dug ponds were low in nutrients and chlorophyll-a and were well buffered in terms of alkalinity. The water quality in the ponds was within ranges required for optimum fish culture and productivity. Ten months after stocking and with no manuring, 16.3 kg of fish was harvested from the Gaba ponds (equivalent to 282 kg ha(-1)). With enhancement of fish growth through nutrient enrichment, there is a good potential for aquaculture.					van Dam, Anne/M-4251-2013																90-5782-153-2				2005							350	368																WOS:000231864300026
J	Schumann, G; Lauener, G				Schumann, G; Lauener, G			Application of a degree-day snow depth model to a Swiss glacierised catchment to improve neural network discharge forecasts	NORDIC HYDROLOGY												A trained soft artificial neural network (SANN) model was applied to the Gornera catchment (Valais Alps, Switzerland) over the melt season May to September 2001 to predict hourly discharge up to five days ahead A SANN discharge forecast for three days ahead has previously been performed on this catchment using only past discharge and past and forecast air temperature as model training inputs. In this study, present zonal snow depth was included as a model input, which was predicted for five altitudinal catchment zones using an empirical degree-day model. Hourly discharge values for up to five days ahead were reconstructed using SANN predicted daily discharge parameters along with a normalised long-term moving average model (MAHM). The efficiency criterion R-2 gives a model performance of 0.927 for a 24-hour-ahead forecast and 0.824 for a 120-hour-ahead forecast. Compared to previous work, adding the snow model to the SANN model inputs considerably increases the forecast accuracy, in particular during days of progressive discharge increase and thunderstorms. The SANN model yields excellent results on days marked by stable weather conditions, with an R-2 value between 0.913 and 0.995. However, the model is unable to reliably predict low frequency, high magnitude events, e.g. release of stored water from a glacial lake.

C	Silva, EIL		Reddy, MV		Silva, EIL			Phytoplankton characteristics, trophic evolution, and nutrient dynamics in an urban eutrophic lake: Kandy Lake in Sri Lanka	RESTORATION AND MANAGEMENT OF TROPICAL EUTROPHIC LAKES					International Workshop on Restoration and Management of Eutrophic Lakes	2001	Kunming, PEOPLES R CHINA					One of the most crucial water pollution problems prevalent in lakes and reservoirs located in urban environments is cultural eutrophication, resulting in impairment of water for intended uses such as drinking, food processing, recreation, aesthetic purposes, etc., Cultural eutrophication is a result of nutrient enrichment (N and P) anthropogenic events rather than natural processes. A manmade water body, Kandy Lake, located in the heart of the second largest city adjoining the world famous Buddhist temple in Sri Lanka was affected by an outbreak of a cyanobacteria. bloom (Microcystis aeruginosa) in May 1999 with the onset of the southwest monsoonal winds. Although seasonal change in water temperature was within the tropical range, Kandy Lake showed a marked diel variation temperature/density stratification. Alkaline to acidic water column from surface to bottom of the deep basin was characteristic with a clinograde oxygen profile, which collapsed only on a few occasions under prevailing high wind during peak southwest monsoon. The calcium and bicarbonate dominant lakewater was about threefold more conductive than the inland surfacewater found at a similar elevation. Long-term enrichment resulting from both anthropogenic and natural processes led the water body to collapse due to an outbreak of cyanobacteria (Microcystis aeruginosa) bloom in May 1999. The most likely hypothesis for the out break of cyanobacteria bloom was the sudden drop in the water level, which facilitated rapid uptake of nutrients from bottom layers due to M. aeruginosa. Nitrogen, phosphorus and silica dynamics, coupled with annual rainfall pattern and monsoon-bound wind mixing determined the seasonal periodicity of phytoplankton species during pre- and post-blooming periods. Pediastrum simplex, a Chlorophyte commonly found in eutrophic tropical waters, which dominated the phytoplankton community under dry weather in Kandy Lake, became virtually absent following the outbreak of M. aeruginosa bloom, while Aulacoseira granulata, a chain forming centric diatom, known to be a climax species in the tropics, declined dramatically during post-blooming. The outbreak of cyanobacteria changed the functional phytoplankton groups from a rhythmically oscillating Chlorophyte and a Diatomophyceae to a multiple assemblage of Cyanophytes. The upper level of the annual mean chlorophyll-a, which showed an exponential increase over a period of seven years, had a negative correlation with the lower limit of the annual mean water transparency. Implementation of either top-down or bottom-up strategies or a combination of both for the restoration of Kandy Lake should be based on a clear understanding of food web interactions and external and internal nutrient loading of this unique water body.																					1-57808-370-2				2005							227	270																WOS:000235752400009
J	Wilkes, G; Sawada, M				Wilkes, G; Sawada, M			Geostatistically derived Great Lakes USLE monthly rainfall erosivity factors	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The R factor, an index of rainfall erosivity in the universal soil loss equation (USLE), fundamentally governs water related soil loss from agricultural plots and is based on well studied empirical relations. Soil particles and adsorbed contaminants from agricultural runoff inevitably end up in watercourses and ultimately the Great Lakes system, disturbing natural habitat, reducing water clarity and quality. We here use over 22 years of records containing hourly precipitation recordings for 453 meteorological-recording sites in Ontario, southwestern Quebec, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York to estimate the R factor surrounding the lower Laurentian Great Lakes. We generate annual and monthly R factor maps for the major growing season months using geostatistical interpolation. Our annual and seasonal maps can help in land use planning within the regions of intense agriculture surrounding Lakes Huron, Erie, and Ontario. Moving north of the Great Lakes, we find greater proportional errors on estimated R values because of low meteorological-recording site density. We find a strong northeast trend in decreasing erosivity of rainfall in the study area. The mean R value for 453 sites was 1,599.13 MJ mm(-1) ha(-1) yr(-1), with a standard deviation of 591.74 MJ mm(-1) ha(-1) yr(-1). Results are in general agreement with other published work but show some spatial differences due to climatic and physiographic variations across our study area.					; Sawada, Michael/O-8457-2019	Sawada, Michael/0000-0001-5180-5325; 													0380-1330						2005	31	2					155	165		10.1016/S0380-1330(05)70247-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(05)70247-1													WOS:000230350800004

J	MILLER, SJ; STORCK, T				MILLER, SJ; STORCK, T			TEMPORAL SPAWNING DISTRIBUTION OF LARGEMOUTH BASS AND YOUNG-OF-YEAR GROWTH, DETERMINED FROM DAILY OTOLITH RINGS	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Age and growth of young-of-year largemouth bass M. salmoides in Lake Shelbyville, Illinois [USA] were determined from daily growth rings in otoliths of fish collected in Sept. of 1980 and 1981. Otolith ages, adjusted for the interval from spawning to the start of feeding (swim-up), revealed that spawning of largemouth bass occurred during 45 days from late April until early June in both years. Spawning occurred at temperatures of 12-20.degree. C. In mid-Sept., 60-75% of the variation in largemouth bass lenghts was attributable to age. Older individuals had increased their initial length advantage through faster average daily growth. Back-calculated lengths at 5 day intervals indicated that growth was most rapid to early Aug. and had decreased by mid-Sept. Growth of individuals that reached swim-up in mid-June declined much more rapidly than growth of individuals that reached swim-up in late May. Differences in growth between largemouth bass that reached swim-up on different dates were associated with differences in their ability to make the transition from an invertebrate to a fish diet. If overwinter survival depends upon length attained during the first growing season, temporal spawning distribution may be an important factor affecting year-class strength.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					1984	113	5					571	578		10.1577/1548-8659(1984)113<571:TSDOLB>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1984)113<571:TSDOLB>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1984TS33300003

Activities of these nuclides at various depths within the water column, in sediments, in streams flowing into and out of the lake, and in precipitation were measured at approximately monthly intervals for a period of one year. Streamwater contained about 10 dpm/100kg of 210Pb, mostly filtrable, and showed little variation with changing flow. 210Pb in the streams is believed to be derived mostly from 222Rn that enters groundwater via alpha-recoil from aquifer matrix materials. It is therefore not meteoric in origin and represents a local source to the lake. Surface inflow was equally important as precipitation as a source of 210Pb to the lake. Only half of total 210Pb input was trapped in sediments; the rest was lost from the lake as outflow. The 210Pb removal times via scavenging and sedimentation both averaged close to 40 days, and 210Pb scavenging was almost an order of magnitude greater than that of 210Po.

J	HELFMAN, GS				HELFMAN, GS			TWILIGHT ACTIVITIES AND TEMPORAL STRUCTURE IN A FRESH-WATER FISH COMMUNITY	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Underwater observations of temperate lake fishes suggest that their twilight activities are basically similar to those described for coral reef fishes. At dusk, diurnally active lake fishes progressively increased swimming, ceased feeding, disbanded groups, slowed swimming and finally stopped. At dawn, this sequence was reversed, although at lower light levels than corresponding dusk behaviors. Aggressive, cleaning and comfort behavior increased at dusk, and fishes changed from group to individual behaviors. By day, nocturnally active fishes rested singly or in aggregations. Predators were more active during twilight. Older individuals of several species were active later in the evening or were increasingly nocturnal in their activities. Characteristic diel and twilight patterns broke down during the breeding season. Temperate lake species differed from coral reef fishes in that they were less attracted to physical structure at night, twilight migrations were less common and no apparent interim period occurred between cessation of activity by diurnal fishes and initiation of activity by nocturnal ones. Twilight changeover in the temperate system was more variable and prolonged. These differences may be due to lake fishes having evolved under variable conditions of community diversity, water clarity, predator abundance and twilight length. Such factors are more constant or predictable in coral reef communities, where twilight activity patterns appear more precise.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1981	38	11					1405	1420		10.1139/f81-187	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f81-187													WOS:A1981MT89600012

A total of 18 runoff plots were installed which contained the main soil uses that are present in the region: pasture, irrigated crops, seasonal crops, oak forest, and sub-tropical brush. Monthly sampling was performed during the rainy period, from August to October 2012. Most of the loss in soil occurred on plots with seasonal farming, with 630.7 kg ha(-1), followed by pastures with 87.9 kg ha(-1), and to a lesser extent, oak forest with 3.9 kg ha(-1). Taking all of the soil uses together, the total soil loss in the study area was 6 593 t ha(-1) year(-1), and was greater in areas with seasonal crops, with 4 019 t ha(-1) year(-1). Organic matter was a soil component with the greatest loss during the water erosion process, with values between 24.5 and 5.1 kg ha(-1) for seasonal crops and pastures, respectively. The macronutrients measured in the sediment also were found to be correlated with the previous factor; the highest N, P, and K values recorded correspond to irrigation crops, with values of 0.9, 0.1 and 2.1 kg ha(-1), respectively.					; Cruz-Cárdenas, Gustavo/A-6621-2011; Álvarez-Bernal, D/AAA-1630-2019	Alvarez-Bernal, Dioselina/0000-0002-5946-7292; 													0187-8336	2007-2422				NOV-DEC	2017	8	6					117	128		10.24850/j-tyca-2017-06-08	http://dx.doi.org/10.24850/j-tyca-2017-06-08													WOS:000419286600008

Along with ever increasing human activities, agricultural and domestic wastes have been directly discharged into river systems around the Watershed, which consequently poses a grave threat to the sustainable development of Xinjiang. Through statistical and spatial analysis, we have determined the relationships between land use/cover (LULC) and hydro-chemical characteristics during rainy and dry seasons in 2014. Spatial patterns of hydro-chemical characteristics as demonstrated by mineralization, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and SO42-, HCO3-, Cl-, Mg2+, Na+, Ca2+ and K+ concentrations were examined in 113 sites. Since hydro-chemical characteristics were affected by LULC patterns, this study delineated six zones to analyze the distribution characteristics of hydro-chemical parameters and its relationship with LULC patterns. The results showed that, except for the pH, all variables demonstrated significant spatial differences during dry and rainy seasons. In addition, the relationships between water quality and LULC patterns indicated that the farmland, forest-grassland, water body and salinized land all affected hydro-chemical characteristics during both rainy and dry seasons. Especially, decreased rainfall, irrigation, surface runoff, the area of lake, etc. largely led to the increase in ion content, which had great influence on hydro-chemical characteristics parameters in dry season. Furthermore, we established several stepwise linear multiple regressions models. The results showed that pH, mineralization and Ca2+ were defined by forest-grassland, while the Cl- and Mg2+ were defined by salinized land during the rainy season. The pH and Na+ were estimated based on farmland, whereas Cl- and Ca2+ were estimated based on forest-grassland during the dry season. In conclusion, this research on the relationships between the spatial distribution of hydro-chemical characteristics in Ebinur Lake Watershed and LULC patterns will be significant for the sustainable management of the arid regions in northwest China.

Further confirmation of this correlation comes from three sources: (a) the relative abundances of pollen component groups reveal the Nothofagidites, Proteacidites and Myrtaceidites groups within the Shoalhaven assemblage to be typical of Late Eocene to middle Oligocene sequences; (b) comparisons with the ratios of Phyllocladidites mawsonii to gymnosperms, Araucariacites to gymnosperms, N. flemingii to other Nothofagidites and Myrtaceae to Nothofagidites in the Murray Basin indicate at least an Upper N. asperus age; and (c) strong geomorphic and stratigraphic evidence reported elsewhere shows that the spore and pollen bearing sediments were deposited in a basalt dammed lake between 29-32 Ma. The mid-Oligocene Shoalhaven assemblage fills a significant gap in the spore-pollen record of the southeast Australian highlands and, as a consequence, there is now a continuous record of development of flora and climate for this region for nearly the entire Tertiary. Average annual temperature and thermal seasonality appear to have been the two most significant climatic parameters to have varied throughout the southeastern highlands from the Palaeocene to the Miocene after which progressively drier conditions ensued.

J	Zhang, B; Schwartz, FW; Tong, DQ				Zhang, Bo; Schwartz, Franklin W.; Tong, Daoqin			LANDSAT Sub-pixel Analysis in Mapping Impact of Climatic Variability on Prairie Pothole Changes	TRANSACTIONS IN GIS												The Prairie Pothole Region in the United States contains millions of seasonal, semi-permanent, or permanent lakes and wetlands that typically range in size from 0.1 to 10 ha. These lakes and wetlands are vulnerable to climate change, especially in our study area in South Dakota, in which a period of deluge following a sharp drought considerably expanded the areal extent of prairie pothole lakes during the last decade of the twentieth century. Preliminary estimates of lake areas, determined using LANDSAT 5 and 7 images, had appreciable errors especially for the smallest of these lakes. This article describes a new sub-pixel approach integrated with a CART (Classification and Regression Tree) model using a GIS (Geographical Information System) to quantify mixed water pixels along lake boundaries to improve area estimations for pothole lakes. Errors in estimated area were typically 10% or less for lakes greater than 1 ha in size. An analysis of lakes in our study area demonstrates how lake area changed with the transition from drought to deluge. Small lakes exhibited a distinct seasonal variation in contrast to large lakes that tended to follow precipitation trends more broadly. The total water area of lakes is consistent with broad variation in rainfall.																			1361-1682	1467-9671				APR	2009	13	2					179	195		10.1111/j.1467-9671.2009.01149.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9671.2009.01149.x													WOS:000207963300002
J	Podniesinski, GS; Leopold, DJ				Podniesinski, GS; Leopold, DJ			Plant community development and peat strategy in forested fens in response to ground-water flow systems	WETLANDS												The objective of this study was to examine plant community development and peat stratigraphy in the context of ground-water flow systems for five forested peatlands in central New York State for which extensive vegetation, surface hydrology, and water chemistry analyses has been performed. Peatland development trends, from the initial period of peat accumulation to the present, were explored using pear stratigraphy, analysis of ground-water flow systems and evidence fi om existing vegetation. Detailed analyses, including the construction of numerical ground-water models were performed for one of the five sites to examine the process of bog development within what was once a highly calcareous fen and to examine the impacts of agricultural drainage on peatland ground-water flow. Feat stratigraphy analysis indicated two pathways of peatland development: infilling of shallow lakes and peat accumulation on ground-water seeps. Lake-infill peatlands were characterized by a sequence of Limnic peat--> bryophyte-sedge peat-->hemic-fibric sedge peat-->sapric wood peat (or Sphagnum peat). Analysis of ground-water flow systems indicated that four of the peatlands were characterized by mineral-rich ground-water discharge along peatland margins, with lateral flow through the peatlands towards drainage features. The fifth peatland was characterized by a more complex ground-water flow system with a weakly minerotrophic water-table mound driving shallow ground-water recharge flow. The water-table mound has been reduced in extent by agricultural drainage and demonstrates seasonal fluctuations in hydraulic head and areal extent.																			0277-5212					SEP	1998	18	3					409	430		10.1007/BF03161534	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF03161534													WOS:000076139900009

Shannon-Weaver diversity index was calculated on the base of number of individuals and on the base of biomass. On average, the diversity (annual mean) was highest in mesotrophic lakes. A comparison of three morphologically different (esp. exposure to wind, surface area and mean depth) lakes (Pelhamer See, Thalersee and Kautsee) sought to find out how the phytoplankton community structure reacts to events of intermediate disturbance, in terms of diversity - or biomass changes. Principal Component Analysis was used to measure the persistence of the phytoplankton association. The examples given in this paper led to these conclusions: High diversity or increase in diversity occur in compositionally instable communities, in high wind-stress events, with small algae and with high grazing. Low diversity or decrease in diversity occur in compositionally stable periods, when conditions select few species, as large forms dominate and as grazing by zooplankton takes effect. Gradual seasonal changes are observed in structurally stable lakes. In lakes exposed to frequent disturbances, seasonal changes may be dominated by intermediate responses.																			0018-8158					JAN 10	1993	249	1-3					101	109		10.1007/BF00008846	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008846													WOS:A1993KN39000011
J	EZAKI, Y				EZAKI, Y			FEMALE CHOICE AND THE CAUSES AND ADAPTIVENESS OF POLYGYNY IN GREAT REED WARBLERS	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												(1) In a dense reedbed at Lake Biwa in Japan 30-80% of male great reed warblers were polygynous each year, whereas others remained monogamous or even unmated throughout the breeding season. (2) Males that had established territories by mid-May (early males) were more likely to be polygynous than those that established territories after mid-May (late males). Second females were attracted to the territories of early males, evben though unmated late males held territories nearby. (3) Many late males attracted mates when the first mates of early males either had not yet laid or had chicks. At these stages, males do not sing actively and hence did not attract females. Already mated early males attracted as many or more females as unmated late males as long as they were singing. (4) Early males held large territories early in the breeding season and late males established their territories by carving out a part of the former''s territory. Territories of early males always included an area of dense vegetation which was never yielded to later arrivals. (5) Polygynously mated females bred at a higher nesting density and their males fed the chicks at variable rates, but second females of early males fledged as many young as simultaneously nesting females mated with late males. Thus, polygyny was also adaptive to the female. Predation on eggs and chicks of females of late males was heavy, probably owing to the poorest nest cover in their territories. (6) This study strongly supports the polygyny threshold model of Verner-Willson-Orians. I further suggest that social interactions betwen males play an important role favouring polygyny in this species.																			0021-8790	1365-2656				FEB	1990	59	1					103	119		10.2307/5161	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/5161													WOS:A1990CL15300007
J	Watson, RT; Rabarisoa, R				Watson, RT; Rabarisoa, R			Sakalava fishermen and Madagascar Fish Eagles: enhancing traditional conservation rules to control resource abuse that threatens a key breeding area for an endangered eagle	OSTRICH					9th Pan-African Ornithological Congress	DEC 01-07, 1996	ACCRA, GHANA	Birdlife Int, Royal Soc Protect Birds, Standard Chartered Bank, Accra, Ghana Wildlife Soc, Minist Lands & Forest, Ghana Natl Petr Corp, Frank Champman Mem Fund, Ghana Chamber Mines, Ecobank, Accra, British Council, Accra, European Union				Survival of the Madagascar Fish Eagle is threatened by human persecution and habitat loss. Of a global Madagascar Fish Eagle population estimated at 100 breeding pairs, the single most important concentration often pairs breeds on three adjacent lakes near the southern end of the species' range along the western seaboard of Madagascar. Fishing on the lakes is the main livelihood of local Sakalava tribes people who have harmoniously shared these important wetlands with fish eagles for centuries. In the last five years Peregrine Fund researchers have documented a massive influx of up to 275 seasonal migrant. fishermen who abuse local traditional resource extraction rules. The economic incentive to endure the hardship of migration to the lakes and camping on the lakeshore for the season is strong. In 1995 per-capita income from fishing was about $1 500 for the six month season, 7.5 times the national annual average. Fish stocks were rapidly diminished through the fishing season as catches diminished to the point where fishermen gave up fishing before the end of the season. The resilience of introduced Tilapia sp. has so far ensured that stocks rebounded between fishing seasons. Fish stocks were at their lowest when Madagascar Fish Eagle nestlings fledged. The most serious impact of fishermen may be on the lake-side forest, which was used as a source of dugout canoes and wood to fuel fish-drying fires. Up to 275 trees were cut for canoes in 1995 and up to 90 wood fires burned for a total of about 111 500 hours to dry a catch of almost 6.9 million fish.

J	MAGGS, J; HEWETT, B				MAGGS, J; HEWETT, B			SOIL AND LITTER RESPIRATION IN RAIN-FORESTS OF CONTRASTING NUTRIENT STATUS AND PHYSIOGNOMIC STRUCTURE NEAR LAKE EACHAM, NORTH-EAST QUEENSLAND	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Soil and litter respiration and nutrient concentrations (N,P, Ca, Mg and K) were measured in two adjacent rainforests near Lake Eacham on the Atherton Tableland in north-east Queensland. One forest had soil formed on basalt and, in physiognomic-structural classification of Webb (1968, 1978), was structurally complex. The other had soil formed on metamorphic rock and was structurally simple. Respiration was measured by the alkali trap method on 16 monthly occasions in 1986 and 1987. Soil and litter nutrient concentrations were higher in the complex forest (with the exception of soil N). The relative differences were greater for soil than litter and more pronounced for P and Ca (and also soil Mg) than other nutrients. Litter polyphenol concentrations were lower in the complex forest. Rates of litter respiration in the complex forest were, on average, nearly twice those of the simple forest. Soil respiration rates were occasionally slightly lower in the complex forest during the wet season but did not differ between the forests during the dry season. Highest rates of respiration were measured during the wet season although high rates for litter occasionally occurred during the dry season. Cumulative CO2 release from the soil and overlying litter did not differ between forests and averaged 5134 .+-. 96 g CO2 m-2 per year (mean .+-. s.e.m.) (1400 g C m-2 per year). Litter respiration accounted for 14% of the annual release in the complex forest and 11% in the simple forest. The association between site nutrient status and forest physiognomic structure at Lake Eacham represents a more general pattern in rainforests of north-east Queensland. Further study is needed to ascertain whether the results from this study apply more generally in both primary and secondary rainforests.																			0307-692X					SEP	1990	15	3					329	336		10.1111/j.1442-9993.1990.tb01037.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-9993.1990.tb01037.x													WOS:A1990EN86900009

Kd varied by a factor of 2 to 3 in 8 of the lakes, and a factor of 5 in one. Annual mean Kd (symbol Kd) varied by a factor of approximately 15 between lakes. The maximum depth of water colonized by macrophytes (zc) was also determined. Values of zc were in the range 1.5-12.5 m. The relationship zc=4.34/Kd accounted for most (93 percent) of the variability in zc, indicating that average annual clarity was probably a useful predictor of zc in lakes in this region. The values of zc in these North Island lakes were generally greater than values calculated using previously published empirical relationships derived for northern hemisphere groups of lakes. The extent to which these relationships underestimated zc in the North Island lakes was broadly related to latitude. Estimated average irradiance at zc in each lake was similar to compensation point irradiances reported previously for freshwater macrophytes.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUL 18	1986	137	1					55	60		10.1007/BF00004172	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00004172													WOS:A1986D408300007

Prominence of seasonal water quality assessment in a tropical river using multivariate analysis: Kerala, India	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												An account of seasonal water quality variability has been taken as a proxy for the changes of environmental setting occurring in the catchment areas and helps to illustrate the ecological system processes associated with it. The present study in Meenachil River (L = 78 km, A = 1272 km 2) comprising of stations from upstream to downstream for pre monsoon (PRM), monsoon (MON) and post monsoon (POM). Ca2+ and SO42- show an erratic trend while extreme deviations were observed at S6 and S7 stations. Na+, K+, Cl-, DIC and DOC showed a similar trend in most stations, i. e. (PRM[POM[ MON). Significant rise of DIC and DOC at S7 during POM and PRM could explicate changes ensued in adjacent Vembanad lake system. Strong correlations of DIC and DOC for Na+, K+ and Cl-ions were noted in the study. HCA dendrogram reveals that ion chemistry in S6 and S7 was strictly controlled by neighbouring lake water dynamics. The results demonstrate high F1 variance of 73, 68 and 72% followed by F2 comprising of 17, 19 and 21% for PRM, MON and POM, respectively. General understanding into the autochthonous process associated within the river lake interfaced region was evident from the nutrient variability scenario.

This paper presents the results of a study on the diversity and seasonal succession of phytoplankton in Seri Serdang Lake and Faculty of Engineering Lake conducted between November 2013 and February 2014. A total of 27 species from four phyla (Chlorophyta, Euglenophyta, Cyanobacteria, Bacillariophyta) and 33 species belonging to Cyanobacteria, Chlorophyta, Bacillariophyta, Euglenophyta and Dinophyta were identified from Seri Serdang Lake and the Faculty of Engineering Lake, respectively. Chlorophyta were most dominant in both lakes. Highest number of species recorded was Monoraphidium sp. in Seri Serdang Lake and Pediastrum tetras in Faculty of Engineering Lake. Seri Serdang Lake had lower phytoplankton density (20 cells ml(-1) to 396 cells ml(-1)) as compared to the Faculty of Engineering Lake (250 cells ml(-1) to 300 cells ml(-1)). Although the distance between the two lakes is short, they do not share the same tributary probably leading to the observed differences in water quality, species diversity and succession pattern.

They were examined for supercooling ability and lower lethal temperature. They were all intolerant to freezing. Supercooling points (spontaneous freezing points) of the larvae, pupae and adults were -7.4-degrees +/- 1.0-degrees, -16.3-degrees +/- 4.6-degrees and -15.3-degrees +/- 5.6-degrees-C, respectively. These values represented the potential limits of cold-hardiness of this species. But the median lower lethal temperatures examined under an aqueous condition were always higher than the corresponding mean supercooling points. Half of the larvae, pupae and adults in the aqueous condition were killed at about -3-degrees, -9-degrees and -7-degrees-C, respectively, probably due to inoculative freezing. These temperatures seemed to be the natural lower limits of survival in the immatures and some adults of this species, at least in the active season.																			0722-4060					SEP	1991	11	5					311	314																WOS:A1991GG91200004

The main way of transmission is people to people contact, but also contaminated food and water Thus, EPEC is considered air important food borne and water borne pathogen. Molecular biological methods were used to show not only the prevalence of the bacteria in food and water but also to prove the main characteristics of its pathogenic nature. In all, 642 samples tested in the Bavarian Health and Food Safety Authority in Oberschleissheim. Among them, regular food control samples were taken as well as some samples with possible alterations coming from consumers and collected at the retail level. In addition, regular seasonal analysis of bath water (lakes and rivers) and drinking water according to a federal bacteriological control plan were tested. Last but not least, human samples of children under two years old were routinely analyzed in Our molecular biology department in order to test the presence of possible infection. After serotyping, the most frequent results were compared with those from human stool, showing possible relevant infection sources for human medicine.

Mapping of accumulated nitrogen in the sediment pore water of a eutrophic lake in Iowa, USA	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY					International Conference on Environmental - Survival and Sustainability (ESS 2007)	FEB 19-24, 2007	Lefkosa, CYPRUS					A large pool of nitrogen in the sediment pore fluid of a eutrophic lake in Iowa, USA, was mapped in this study. Previously, the lake had supported fishing and boating, but today it no longer supports its designated uses as a recreational water body. In the top 5 cm of the lake bottom, the pore water nitrogen ranges between 3.1 and 1,250 mu g/cm(3) of sediments, with an average of 160.3 mu g/cm(3). Vertically, nitrate concentrations were measured as 153 mu g/cm(3) at 0-10 cm, 162 mu g/cm(3) at 10-20 cm, and 32 mu g/cm(3) at 20-30 cm. Nitrate mass distribution was quantified as 3.67 x 10(3) kg (65%) in the bottom sediments, 172 kg (3%) in suspended particulates, and 1.83 x 10(3) kg (32%) in the dissolved phase. Soil runoff nutrients arrive at the lake from the heavily fertilized lands in the watershed. Upon sedimentation, a large mass of nitrogen desorbs from mineral particles to the relatively immobile pore fluid. Under favorable conditions, this nitrogen diffuses back into the water column, thereby dramatically limiting the lake's capability to process incoming nutrients from farmlands. Consequently, a condition of oxygen deficiency disrupts the post-season biological activities in the lake.																			0943-0105					MAR	2009	57	2					465	475		10.1007/s00254-008-1317-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00254-008-1317-x													WOS:000263361600023

Factors affecting between-lake variation in the occurrence of epidermal papillomatosis in roach, Rutilus rutilus (L.)	JOURNAL OF FISH DISEASES												The theory of island biogeography predicts that the probability of a species occupying an island depends on a dynamic equilibrium between extinction and colonization. Epidermal papillomatosis is a disease manifesting as skin tumours on fish. We studied the factors affecting the occurrence of the disease in roach, Rutilus rutilus (L.), in 34 lakes. The results of discrimination analysis suggest that maximum depth, percentage of the drainage area of the lake covered by lakes in the vicinity and altitude best identified diseased lakes. Comparison of diseased and non-diseased lakes revealed that lake area could also be regarded as a variable contributing to the occurrence of the disease. The sampling date, proportion of males and mean length of fish did not discriminate between the lakes. The probability of the disease occurring was highest in large, deep, low-altitude lakes which had a high percentage of lakes in their vicinity. Thus, the results indicate that the colonization and extinction processes probably contribute to the occurrence of papillomatosis in roach, as predicted by the theory. Furthermore, the large natural variation in the occurrence of the disease could mask possible environmental effects and between-lake comparisons should be interpreted with caution when using the fish-papillomatosis system as an indicator of environmental stress.

Significant relationships were found with soil organic matter, moisture, clay plus silt, total N, isotopically-exchangeable P, extractable Mg contents and soil pH. When data from all soils, both 0-5 and 10-15 cm depths, were pooled, 66% of the total variation in intensity of phosphatase activity could be accounted for by these soil properties. However, covariance analysis showed that regressions between intensity of phosphatase activity and soil properties differed with soil depth, soil type, season, vegetation type and underlying rock type. When the effects of these interactions were taken into account, up to 99.degree. of the variation in the intensity of phosphatase activity could be accounted for. The relative importance of these interactive factors appeared to be rock type = vegetation type > soil type = season > soil depth. The effects of the soil properties and the interacting factors on the intensity of phosphatase activity in these woodland soils are discussed.																			0038-0717	1879-3428					1983	15	1					93	99		10.1016/0038-0717(83)90124-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0038-0717(83)90124-4													WOS:A1983QE59300014

Yellow perch (Perca flavescens) collected between January and May were infested with glochidia, whereas perch captured between June and October were free of larvae. The prevalence of infestation increased gradually from 86 to 95% between January and May, and the intensity of infestation increased from 5.7 to 49.4 glochidia per fish over the same period. Glochidia were found on most external body surfaces, including the gills. Glochidia attached preferentially to some anatomical areas, especially pectoral and pelvic fins. Furthermore, the relative importance of certain attachment sites differed significantly among sampling dates. Neither sex, size (length or weight), or age of perch significantly affected the intensity of infestation per fish. However, small (4.4-6.0 cm), 1- and 2-year-old fish carried more than 12 times the number of glochidia per gram of body weight than large (12.1-15.7 cm), 4- to 7-year-old fish. Both perch behavior and distribution and clam reproduction and distribution provide possible explanations for the observed patterns in the prevalence and intensity of infestation and in the distribution of the glochidia on the host.																			0008-4301					APR	1991	69	4					964	972		10.1139/z91-140	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z91-140													WOS:A1991FP79800017
J	Glogovic, D				Glogovic, Dunja			THE MISTRESS OF THE HORSES ON IRON AGE PENDANTS FROM KASTAV AND GROBNIK	VJESNIK ARHEOLOSKOG MUZEJA U ZAGREBU												A group of pendants from Croatian Littoral (Hrvatsko Primorje) and Istria (Kringa) which have the heads of horses on the side, are separated, as a different type. They form a group which consists only of pendants which are irrefutably anthropomorphic, and as a result of their triangular shape symbolically represent women (EIBNER 2001: 108). They are finds without reliable data or archaeological context, except the one from Kastav which was found in an archaeological excavations near Misinac in 1972 (BLECIC 2002: 67-131; 2004: 47-106, MATEJCIC 1974: 51-77, Pl. 4). The triangular pendants from Kastav and Grobnik are discussed as part of a large and very varied group of Horse or Animal Pendants from the Japodic culture. With the Japodes the horse also appears on various kinds of ornament and as a utilitarian part of clothing. Horses also appear on thoreutic objects and in as figurines, made from amber etc. (BALEN-LETUNIC 2006: 59, Fig. 55). Indeed the horse is relatively the most frequently found animal in the whole Japod zoological repertoire (RAUNIG 2004: 115). Our pendants from Grobnik and Kastav fall, according to Raunig, among the first variant of pendants showing horses with protomae. In this first variant the pendants are square or trapezoid like the one from Lika (Kompolje) and most of those from Vinica Iron Age group. Only two of the horse pendants from Vinica (figs. 3 and 6) can be included among the basic triangular pendants of the Kastav-Grobnik type (RAUNIG 2004: 103-105). In his article of 1986 Markus Egg collected and described a group of anthropomorphic pendants including a pair of antitetic horses heads from the Alpine region (figs. 7, 8-10). The similarity between our pendants and the Alpine ones is obvious, and we may suppose that they had the same functions and chronology. Egg placed them in the early Iron Age group of Fritzens-Sanzeno. Egg linked them with the antitetic horse protomae from Picenum (EGG 1986: 72). As a direct iconic pattern for the Alpine examples and the Croatian horse pendants Markus Egg puts forward several examples from Greece, an archaic bronze handle attachment from the Athens acropolis and an ivory carving (fig. 11), from Sparta from the shrine of Artemis Orthia (EGG 1986: 75, fig.. 8). The example of a terracotta pendant with a woman's head between antitethic horse heads from the same Laconian shrine (fig. 12). shows Artemis in a variant of the potnia hippon - Mistress of the Horses. The temple of Orthia that is, of the upright Artemis in Sparta was described by Pausanias. In archeological excavations there about a hundred horses were found of different kinds and made of different materials from geometric and archaic periods. Besides the Spartan Artemis Orthiea, the most frequent archaic representation of a winged female goddess who in a heraldic pose holds a horse beside her was in Crete, so it may be supposed that perhaps the origin of potnia hippon is from the early Bronze Age Cretian religion (BEVAN 1986: 206-209). In the Iliad Artemis is described as potnia theron, but the name Mistress of Animals is carried by Hera, Aphrodite, Demetra, etc. The main function of potnia theron is after all that of Artemis. Sometimes Artemis was identified with Hecate - a chtonic goddes with. She was protector of spirits, prophesies, and gifts were left for her with averted eyes, at crossroads on moonless nights (NILS-SON 1967: 204). Goddesses of animals, the mythical potnia theron is the name given to iconographic compositions which have a woman's figure in the centre flanked by two animals or holding one on either side, symbolically portraying a goddess who is in control of animals, of wild nature in the extended sense. Regardless of various theories, compositions showing a goddess with animals originally came from Mesopotamia in 14 or 13 c. BC and through the Levant and Cyprus were adopted in Aegeis, i.e. in Greece (BARCLAY 2001: 373-371). The areas where the triangular pendants with horse protomae were found, as we see on Egg's map, is the region north of Lake Como in the Trentino, Alto Adige and Tyrol, an area which in the Iron Age was ethnically part of Raetians. The genesis and development Raetian culture was described in detail by Paul Gleirscher (1991: 1-60). The pendants from Sanzeno and Mechel (figs. 7 and 9) are considered to be much reduced representations of the Goddess of animals, in this case a horse. The motif comes from the eastern Mediterranean, and through Greece and the Etruscans got to north Italy (GLIERSCHER 1994: 82). The areas where the triangular pendants with horse protomae were found, as we see on Egg's map, is the region north of Lake Como in the Trentino, Alto Adige and Tyrol, an area which in the Iron Age was ethnically part of Raetians. The genesis and development Raetian culture was described in detail by Paul Gleirscher (1991: 1-60). The pendants from Sanzeno and Mechel (figs. 7 and 9) are considered to be much reduced representations of the Goddess of animals, in this case a horse. The motif comes from the eastern Mediterranean, and through Greece and the Etruscans got to north Italy (GLIERSCHER 1994: 82). Among the Raetians, in the north Italian Alps, potnia hippon was identified with the main goddess of that region, and that was the Venetian Goddess Reitia whose name is found on votive tablets from the Venetian shrine Este -Baratella (FOGOLARI - PROSDOCIMI 1988: 169-181). It is said that Reitia was shown on votive tablets from Montebelluno with the attributes of Hecate Kleidouchos - who is holding a key but with certain elements of the Mistress of Animals (KOS-SACK 1999: 76, fig. 53; TURK 2005: 27, fig. 35). Perhaps these are pictures of priestesses (TOMEDI 2002: 1226), or on the tablets, and there are a lot of them, they symbolize the status of women in the Hallstatt culture (EIBNER 2001: 115-118). Evidently there are traces of the cult of a female goddess who in the Alps from potnia theron was largely transformed into potnia hippon -Mistress of the Horses who is symbolically shown with horses on a triangular pendant (fig.. 7-10). Pendants with the Mistress of the Horses served as amulets against evil powers, and they must have been consecrated at some kind of ritual or perhaps they themselves were part of a ritual. The sound they produced may have had an apotropaic effect. Since it is a goddess of horses we may suppose that such horse pendants are in the female domain, perhaps one with religious status (TOMEDI 2002: 12289). Unfortunately we have no proof of any of these possibilities. We only know that the pendant from Misinac was found in a necropolis but outside the grave. Anthropomorphic pendants of the type Kastav-Grobnik, could by analogy with the examples from the Raetian region be interpreted as an emblematic representation of potnia hippon. They have been found in: Kastav, Grobnik, Kringa and Vinica, and date from the late Late Iron Age or the early La Tene period. The relatively large number of anthropomorphic pendants with horses which are connected with Kastav, bearing in mind a number of pedndants of other types (GLOGOVIC 1989: 122, T. 42, 1- 3; BLECIC 2002: T. 9, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3), suggests that it might have been a cult there in the Iron Age, besides the funeral of which we have documentation in the locality of Misinac. The style of the horse workmanship is reminiscent of Japod work, and we do not need to doubt that the pendants are a Japod product, and the Vinica ones of a Colapian (BOZIC 1999: 174-177) workshops. Since the horse was a favourite animal of the Japods this was likely to have been a strong if not decisive factor for using the potnia hippon - motif for the in our region.																			0350-7165					AUG	2009	42	1					259	269																WOS:000438311000013
J	MUGANGU, TE; HUNTER, ML				MUGANGU, TE; HUNTER, ML			AQUATIC FORAGING BY HIPPOPOTAMUS IN ZAIRE - RESPONSE TO A FOOD SHORTAGE	MAMMALIA												During dry seasons, hippos (Hippopotamus amphibius L.) were observed to forage on aquatic vegetation on the plains of Lake Rutanzige in Virunga National Park (VNP), Zaire. Crude protein content of the aquatic vegetation, as well as from plants collected at drier sites, were determined. During the dry seasons of 1989, grasses did not yield adequate levels of crude protein to sustain a hippo except for Panicum repens. Although aquatic vegetation may not be well suited to hippos' foraging behavior, they were obliged to feed on it. Our observations suggest that the hippo population of VNP may be growing beyond the carrying capacity of the parkland during the dry seasons.																			0025-1461						1992	56	3					345	349		10.1515/mamm.1992.56.3.345	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/mamm.1992.56.3.345													WOS:A1992JX09000001

P. willei was found at pH values between 4.2 and 8.5, whereas P. volzii was confined to lakes with a slightly basic pH. The study confirmed the broad limits of P. willei and the much more narrow limits of P. volzii in relation to seasonal occurrence and pH, as well as an affinity of the former to ponds and lakes with a rich bottom vegetation. The study also showed, however, that the species were not as widespread and common in recent Danish lake phytoplankton as generally stated by previous authors. The use of different ecological factors to give weight to species separation is discussed. The inclusion of P. volzii in P. willei proposed by Popovsky & Phiester is not supported by the present study, as the two taxa appear to have different ecological tolerances.																			0107-055X						1992	12	5					557	568		10.1111/j.1756-1051.1992.tb01834.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1756-1051.1992.tb01834.x													WOS:A1992KD98600008

During the growing season, large amounts of the contaminated Potamogeton foliosus and algae were exported downstream from this basin to East Fork Poplar Creek (EFPC). We used drift nets to estimate the loading rates of the plants to EFPC, analyzed samples of the plants for metals, and conducted a series of experiments with snails (Elimia clavaeformis), amphipods (Gammarus sp.), and a microcrustacean (Ceriodaphnia dubia) to evaluate the possible effects of inputs of the vegetation to EFPC biota. Little of the vegetation that entered the stream was transported intact as far as 1.4 km. During the growing season, inputs of organic carbon to this 1.4-km segment of stream due to the deposition of the plants were at least 2.4 times greater than autochthonous production. Thus the vegetation was bioenergetically important to at least a 1- to 3-km reach of EFPC. The experiments showed that all three types of animals could distinguish between contaminated (CON) and noncontaminated (NC) Potamogeton foliosus. Snails preferred the NC plants over the CON plants; these animals also had lower growth rates on CON plants than on NC plants. Amphipods preferred CON plants over NC plants in a 48-h experiment, but preferred NC plants over CON plants in a 7-d experiment. Leachates prepared from CON Potamogeton foliosus were toxic to Ceriodaphnia; those prepared from NC Potamogeton foliosus were not. Energy-subsidy and/or contaminated-food aspects of the Potamogeton inputs could help explain why pollution-sensitive invertebrates such as mayflies and stoneflies are not present in EFPC immediately downstream from the settling basin.					stewart, arthur/D-8471-2012	stewart, arthur/0000-0003-1968-5997													0730-7268						1992	11	5					653	664		10.1897/1552-8618(1992)11[653:FABEOC]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1897/1552-8618(1992)11[653:FABEOC]2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1992HR04800009

Growth and Development of American White Pelican (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos) Chicks at Marsh Lake, Minnesota, USA	WATERBIRDS												The American White Pelican (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos) is an iconic waterbird breeding in the Prairie Pothole and Upper Midwest Regions of North America. Significant variation in recruitment occurs among years. However, mechanisms affecting recruitment, such as variation in size at hatching and chick growth, have not been quantified. In this study, size at hatching and growth rates of American White Pelican chicks were examined at Mash Lake, Minnesota, USA, during 2010-2012. On the day of hatch, the mass and lengths of tarsus, wing and culmen were recorded for the oldest chick in 2-egg nests. No difference was detected in skeletal size at hatching during 2010-2012, but mass of chicks was 11% lower in 2010 than in 2011. Growth rates for mass and wing did not differ between 2011 and 2012, but over 40% of the variation in absolute and instantaneous (relative) growth rates of tarsus was explained by year, with higher rates in 2011; in 2011, nest initiations were started later than other years. Little variation in size at hatching or growth rates were detected between years, but significant variation in size at hatching and growth rates were detected within season depending on the timing of hatch. No difference was detected in initial mass throughout the nesting season, but initial tarsus and wing length were shorter in chicks hatched later in the season in 2012. However, absolute and instantaneous growth rates for mass, tarsus and wing were greater for late-hatched chicks in 2012, potentially allowing late-hatched chicks to fledge at an earlier age.

For effectively supplying waster, they are hydrologically connected and Dajingshan Reservoir first receives the water pumped from the river at Guangchang Pumping Station, and then feeds Fenghuangshan Reservoir, and the two well-connected reservoirs are mesotrophic. Meixi Reservoir is a small and oligotrophic water body and feeds Dajingshan Reservoir only in wet seasons when overflow occurs. Particulate organic matter (POM) was collected from three hydrologically connected water supply reservoirs, and seasonal variations of POM were ascertained from stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes in wet and dry seasons, and the effects of pumping water and reservoir connectivity on POM variations and composition were demonstrated by the relationships of the stable isotope ratios of POM. Seasonality and similarity of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes of POM varied with hydrodynamics, connectivity and trophic states of the four studied water bodies. The two well-connected reservoirs displayed more similar seasonality for delta C-13(POM) than those between the river station and the two reservoirs. However, the opposite seasonality appeared for delta N-15(POM) between the above waters and indicates different processes affecting the stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes of POM. delta C-13(POM) and delta N-15(POM) changed little between wet and dry seasons in Meixi Reservoir-a low productive and rain-driven system, suggesting little POM response to environmental changes in that water system. As expected, connectivity enhanced the similarity of the stable isotope ratios of POM between the water bodies.																			0254-4059	1993-5005				SEP	2017	35	5					1117	1126		10.1007/s00343-017-5327-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-017-5327-y													WOS:000410093300013

Results indicate that reproductive characteristics of Diplodon chilensis are related to occurring environmental features. Individuals from Muelle Viejo compared to those of La Poza showed a more defined reproductive seasonality in monthly frequency of gravid females and recruitment, a higher fecundity, thicker shells in males and females and clearer increments and decrements in dry weight. On the opposite, D. chilensis from La Poza did not show obvious seasonality in reproduction; comparative fecundity and valve thickness values were smaller and there was no variation in the dry weight of soft parts throughout the year. Both populations had low reproductive effort, density and mortality values.																			0716-078X	0717-6317				APR	1990	63	1					23	35																WOS:A1990EJ02900004
J	FANG, X; STEFAN, HG				FANG, X; STEFAN, HG			INTERACTION BETWEEN OXYGEN-TRANSFER MECHANISMS IN LAKE MODELS	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING-ASCE												Dissolved oxygen (DO) distributions in stratified lakes can be simulated by a one-dimensional (vertical), deterministic, unsteady (time-variant) diffusion equation with surface gas transfer as a boundary condition and photosynthetic oxygen production as an internal source. Both surface gas transfer and vertical diffusion depend on turbulence near the water surface. The interaction between these two mechanisms, and photosynthetic productivity of dissolved oxygen in lake models is therefore studied analytically and numerically. The analytical solution of the DO transport equation in a semiinfinite medium is developed. Predicted DO concentrations at depth z are shown to depend on three dimensionless parameters, and the strength of net photosynthetic oxygen production is an important parameter in this analysis. The increases of DO concentrations due to photosynthesis are modulated by surface aeration and vertical diffusion in the lake. A numerical solution of the dissolved oxygen transport equation is also obtained and used to illustrate simulated DO profiles over an entire open water season in two Minnesota lakes. The analytical solution is used to explain certain features of the numerical results.																			0733-9372					JUN	1995	121	6					447	454		10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9372(1995)121:6(447)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9372(1995)121:6(447)													WOS:A1995QY92400005

It may also be a tool in minimizing the devastation resulting from recurrent droughts. To be able to forecast the total annual rainfall or the levels of seasonal floods, a class of models has first been chosen. The model parameters have then been estimated with an appropriate parameter estimation algorithm. Finally, diagnostic tests have been performed to verify the adequacy of the model. These are the general principles of system identification, which is the most crucial part of the forecasting procedure. In this paper several sets of data have been studied using different statistical procedures. The examined data include a historical 835-year record representing the levels of the seasonal Nile floods in Cairo, Egypt, during the period A.D. 622-1457. These readings were originally carried out by the Arabs to a great degree of accuracy in order to be used in estimating yearly taxes or Zacat (Islamic duties). The observations also comprise recent total annual rainfall data over Addis Ababa (Ethiopia) (1907-1984), the total annual discharges of Ethiopian rivers (including the river Sobat discharges at Hillet Doleib, Blue Nile discharge at Roseris, river Dinder, river Rahar, and river Atbara), equatorial lake plateau supply as contributed at Aswan during the period 1912-1982, and the total annual discharges at Aswan during the period 1871-1982. Periodograms have been used to uncover possible periodicities. Trends of rainfall and discharges of some rivers of east and central Africa have been also estimated. Using the first half of the available record, two autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) time series models have been identified, one for the levels of the seasonal Nile floods in Cairo, the second to model the annual rainfall over Ethiopia. The time series models have been applied in I-year-ahead forecasting to the other half of the available record and give fairly promising results, thus indicating the adequacy of the fitted models.																			0003-0007					JAN	1994	75	1					83	94		10.1175/1520-0477(1994)075<0083:TSMAFF>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0477(1994)075<0083:TSMAFF>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1994MW69600007

Results from sampling seasons with different hydrological flow regimes are compared. Samples were taken both within the acid treatment site (A) and the control site (B). In the lake water samples, the relative importance of the low molecular weight fraction (L-Mw; Mw<3kDa) compared to the medium molecular weight fraction (M-Mw; 3kDa<Mw<10kDa) of DOC, organically complexed Al (Al(o)), Fe, and Mn was higher during a low flow period (LF) in July 1992 than in a medium flow period (MF) in June 1991. This difference was most distinct for the basin treated with acid (A). The LF period had higher ionic strength and lower concentration of DOC than the MF period. During a high flow period (HF) in October 1992, the transport of DOC and trace elements (Fe, Mn, La, and Sm) associated with a high molecular weight fraction (H-Mw; Mw>10kDa) of DOC increased. In the lake, the major fraction of Al(o) was present as H-Mw forms, showing small differences in June 1991 (MF) and July 1992 (LF). There seemed to be an increased mobilization of Al in the form of inorganic Al species (Al(i)) in July 1992 (LF) compared to June 1991 (MF), especially in Basin A (lower DOC, increased concentration of SO42-). Al(i) was mainly at M-Mw and L-Mw forms. In the podzol profile, the relative importance of the L-Mw fraction seemed to increase with depth in June 1991 (MF) and July 1992 (LF), a size distribution pattern which also was observed in the dystric histosol in June 1991 (MF). This indicates that the vertical transport of L-Mw forms are higher than for 11-Mw forms.

The measurement data were used to estimate wet, dry, and total deposition of sulphates and nitrates to the watershed. Over the 4 yr, the annual values of total (wet plus dry) deposition ranged from 34 to 38 (.+-. 15%) mmol .cntdot. m-2 yr-1 for SO42- and from 38 to 47 (.+-. 30%) mmol .cntdot. m-2 yr-1 for NO3-. On a molar basis, the deposition of total NO3- exceeded total NO3- by 68%. Dry deposition represented approximately 15 and 25% of the total deposition of SO42- and NO3-, respectively, to the watershed. Wet and dry deposition of sulphate and nitrate was found to be highly episodic, with the top 20% of daily events delivering 60-70% of the total sulphur and nitrogen deposition to the watershed. Statistically significant seasonal cycles were found in the concentration and deposition values of most of the sulphur and nitrogen species measured at the watershed.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1988	45			1			14	25																WOS:A1988Q784000002

The test lakes had few, if any, native lake trout. Little or no survival of stocked lake trout occurred in lakes with pH 5.0 or less. Hiigh survival and growth occurred in intermediately acidic (pH 5.6-6.1) and circumneutral (pH 6.9-7.3) lakes. Survival of stocked lake trout increased with size at the time of stocking. Size differences of the three size-classes introduced in each lake were mantained throughout the 2-year study. Competition with other resident fish species appeared to influence stocking success strongly. There was an inverse relationship between the biomass of stocked lake trout subsequently recaptured and biomass of all hypolimnetic species present in the lake. Intraspecific competition with previously stocked lake trout also appeared to restrict survival of lake trout in subsequent stockings.					; Gunn, John/F-8057-2012	Gunn, John/0000-0002-4052-2781; 													0002-8487	1548-8659				JUL	1987	116	4					618	627		10.1577/1548-8659(1987)116<618:SAGOSL>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1987)116<618:SAGOSL>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1987M621800011

These are usually obtained from lake hydrodynamic models. In turn, hydrodynamic models require accurate specification of meteorological forcing. Uncertain specification of meteorological forcing over large lakes is one of the main reasons for the lack of correspondence between three-dimensional hydrodynamic models and observations of lake currents, temperatures and water levels. This is especially the case for intermontane lakes where sheltering effects of the surrounding topography disturb the air flow and generate such other mesoscale meteorological features as slope winds which can reinforce lake breezes. Direct observations of meteorological variables on lakes are sparse in the tropics. We present here the results of such observations for Lakes Malawi/Nyasa and Tanganyika. During 1998-1999 a roving meteorological station was mounted aboard the research vessel, RN Usipa, on Lake Malawi/Nyasa. Ship velocity and position were recorded, thus allowing winds to be measured aboard the moving platform. On Lake Tanganyika similar data were recorded at two moored meteorological buoys for substantial periods over a period of four years. An examination of the longest running series of winds and air temperatures over Lake Malawi/Nyasa showed no obvious interannual differences in wind speed although air temperatures in the second half of 1999 were cooler than in the same period in 1998. On Lake Tanganyika wind speeds decreased between 1993 and 1996 but air temperatures were highest in 1995. Based on spectral analysis, both lakes illustrate a strong diurnal signal of wind components and air temperatures. Calculations of an average evaporation rate for Uke Malawi/Nyasa based on observed meteorological data from all temporal scales and three different calculation methods resulted in a mean of 6.4 +/- mm/d. Diurnally fluctuating meteorological conditions accounted for 36% of the total evaporation. Wet and dry season evaporation rates were compared for the two extremities of Lake Tanganyika and found to be higher in south and during the dry season, Preliminary results of an application of a three-dimensional mesoscale meteorological model to Uke Malawi/Nyasa are compared to direct over-lake observations of a number of forcing parameters required by hydrodynamic models. Comparisons of over-lake winds show that modeled winds are superior by three statistical measures to those interpolated from a limited number of shore-based stations.																					1-4020-0772-8				2002	12						121	151																WOS:000179074600004

Water column stability and anoxia	TAILINGS AND MINE WASTE '02					9th International Conference on Tailings and Mine Waste	JAN 27-30, 2002	COLORADO STATE UNIV, FT COLLINS, CO		COLORADO STATE UNIV			The tendency of pit mine lakes to permanently stratify and become anoxic has tremendous influence on the accumulation of trace metals and thus the environmental liability of mine owners and operators. Most pit mine lakes have a large depth/surface area ratio commonly referred to as the relative depth (z(r)). This, plus the fact that pit walls tend to shelter the lake from wind stress, means that pit lakes do not mix as easily as natural lakes and therefore have a tendency to stratify. In order to become permanently stratified, the density contrast between the surface and deep waters of a lake must be sufficiently high that wind-induced shear stresses cannot mix the water column. The gradient Richardson number (Ri), defined as the ratio of vertical density gradient to the square of the vertical velocity gradient, is typically used to quantify these two competing forms of energy. A water column is permanently stratified when the Ri > 0.25. This is more likely occur when z(r) is large because wind energy is less effective at penetrating the water column. Detailed measurements of currents and density at the Yerington, Nevada pit mine lake confirms the generalized application of the Richardson number criteria. Numerical models of lakes also show that intermediate depth lakes (10-30 m) lakes are more likely to become seasonally anoxic while shallow lakes (< 10 m) are neither permanently nor seasonally anoxic.																					90-5809-353-0				2002							189	194																WOS:000175560600026

They provide habitat for many species of plants, fish, waterfowl and other wildlife. Acting as natural water purification systems, wetlands also filter contaminants and excessive nutrients. Despite the many functions and values of these ecosystems, human activities over the past 200 years have resulted in significant wetland degradation and loss within the Great Lakes basin. Recently, wetland managers have identified the need to produce a detailed and accurate digital database of these ecosystems in order to better map and monitor their changes. To provide the detail that is necessary for management decisions, high-resolution imagery is often required. The overall goal of this study is to develop improved methods for wetland monitoring and management in Ontario. A specific objective of this is to investigate the capabilities of the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (cast) and Ikonos-2 sensors to provide detailed information on wetland vegetation and adjacent land-use/land-cover types in a shoreline wetland and in a series of inland wetland complexes located in south-central Ontario. In particular, the question arises as to what extent these data can be used to meet the operational mapping and monitoring requirements of governmental and non-governmental agencies responsible for wetland management within this region. Spatial- and spectral-mode casi as well as Ikonos-2 data were acquired over the selected study sites during the year 2000 growing season. Standard image analysis techniques were used to determine the information content of these data. Results to date indicate that high-resolution data can provide detailed information about wetlands and adjacent land-use and landcover types. The most useful and accurate results were obtained by applying a maximum-likelihood classifier to selected green, red and near-infrared bands of the spatial-mode case data. These data permitted the greatest differentiation between vegetation types, particularly within the inland wetland site. Using these data, it was also possible to distinguish shallow open water and submergent aquatic communities, a task that has been difficult to accomplish with broad-band satellite data (e.g., Landsat TM). Discussions with resource managers indicate that the results of this study are useful to agencies responsible for wetland management in Ontario.																					0-7803-7536-X				2002							3089	3091																WOS:000179116801004

Four years of treatment stockings were compared to 4 years of standard (fingerling) stockings using gill net and creel surveys. Gill net catch per unit effort (CPUE) was higher (P = 0.04) during the treatment phase, and percentage of marked fish within populations steadily increased and reached a high of 91% in 1997. No evidence of natural reproduction was observed. Overall, abundance and stocking size were directly related (r(2) = 0.57, P = 0.01), but there was no significant difference among the 4 treatment cohorts, suggesting that catfish 254-315 mm total length were equally abundant the year following stocking. Harvest was higher (P = 0.05) during and immediately following treatment stockings. Total annual mortality (A) based on cohort analysis ranged from 34%-51%. A catch curve for treatment fish throughout the study yielded an A of 37% (age 2-6). Growth was moderate, as quality size (4 10 mm) was attained after 2 growing seasons.																									2002							65	74																WOS:000189400700007

Free APA associated with the dissolved fraction (< 0.22 μm) was not detected. In the superficial layers, more than 60 % of APA was correlated with the 0.22-0.65 μm size fraction. In deeper layers, more than 58 % of total APA was associated with 0.65-100 μm size fraction and was significantly correlated with algal parameters (algal counts, chlorophyll a). The lack of correlation between phosphorus (P-PO43- and P-PT) and total APA suggests the independance of phosphorus to APA.

How to monitor and assess them is becoming a key problem for flood's mitigating and controlling. The decision-maker wants to know the real situation about floods eagerly. In fact, the flood information is often greatly different from many sources. With the development of remote sensing technology, scientists found some approaches to monitor floods in a large scale. However, in their researches, there is no any standard for flood assessment. The promising approach is to establish the standard of assessment according to each flooding area. To solve this problem, "normal water extent" concept was put forward in our research. In one hand, they mean the minimal values for the assessment of flood's losses. In the other hand, they are some special areas according to the situation around the areas of river, lake, reservoir and dyke, land use and etc., which are easy to suffer from flood during the flooding season. The objective of our research is to study the methodology for identification normal water extent and for setting up its database, which can be used as a standard for monitoring and assessing floods. The procedure can be generalized as two steps. The first one is to identify the normal water extents by automatic extraction or human-computer interactive interpretation using Landsat 5 TM and NOAA/AVHRR images. The second step is to integrate the normal water extents for each flooding area into a database, which can be called "normal water extent database" with some related spatial data, remote sensing images and their attribution data. In our study, a database for normal water extent of even-large-river basins in China was set up, and it was quoted for monitoring the floods in China since 1999. The assessment results were utilized in several government ministries of China, such as State Planning Committee, Civil Administration Ministries and et al. The application shows that, normal water extent database can help to improve the efficiency of flood assessment and the accuracy of flood information, unify the criteria of its assessment. It can be used as a feasible standard for assessment of occurring floods. In this paper, how to set up a normal water extent database and how to use it to monitor flood will be introduced in detail.																					0-7803-7536-X				2002							2048	2050																WOS:000179116800667

The total bacterial population was divided into small (0.2-1.0-.mu.m) and large (1.0-3.0 .mu.m) free-living bacteria and attached bacteria by fractionated filtration. Data for attached bacteria, received by retention on 3.0-.mu.m-pore Nucleopore filters, were corrected for free-living bacteria in this fraction. Specific uptake rates based on autoradiography were also recorded. Specific uptake rates for attached bacteria ranged from 9.41 .times. 10-11 to 6.11 .times. 10-8 ng of C h-1 cell-1 and were significantly greater than those for free-living bacteria during most time periods, but they were not significantly different from those for cells proven to be active by autoradiography. Specific uptake rates for small free-living bacteria ranged between 7.68 .times. 10-11 and 4.60 .times. 10-9 ng of C h-1 cell-1. They were nearly in the same range of those for large free-living bacteria (5.10 .times. 10-11 to 1.07 .times. 10-8 ng of C h-1 cell-1), although both fractions exhibited pronounced differences in their seasonal and vertical distributions.																			0099-2240	1098-5336					1985	49	5					1254	1259		10.1128/AEM.49.5.1254-1259.1985	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.49.5.1254-1259.1985								4004239					WOS:A1985AGU0500040

J	Townsend, SA				Townsend, SA			Seasonal pattern and inferred phosphorus limitation of phytoplankton biomass in two tropical reservoirs in northern Australia	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Manton River Reservoir (MRR) and Darwin River Reservoir (DRR) are two small impoundments in the Australian wet/dry tropics. Over an eight-year period, chlorophyll a concentrations in the mixed layer averaged 3.6 mg L-1 in DRR, and 7.1 mu g L-1 in MRR. The seasonal pattern of chlorophyll a at MRR was influenced by wet season wash-out (February average 4.8 mu g L-1), and dry season destratification and nutrient enrichment of the surface waters (July average 8.4 mu g L-1). In contrast, DRR exhibited near uniform chlorophyll a concentrations over the year. The seasonal patterns of DRR and MRR chlorophyll a are typical of tropical water bodies which tend to have a smaller annual range than temperate lakes, though this can be modified by significant wash-out. Empirical evidence suggests that the phytoplankton biomass of each reservoir is phosphorus limited, relative to the potential provided by other nutrients and light energy. This conclusion is based on a regression of total phosphorus and chlorophyll a concentrations of pooled DRR and MRR data (P < 0.001; r(2) = 0.90), and the high total-nitrogen to total-phosphorus concentration ratios (by weight) of 50 and 37 in DRR and MRR, respectively. Annual chlorophyll a and total phosphorus concentrations for both reservoirs are in accord with the OECD regression for temperate lakes and reservoirs.																			1323-1650						2000	51	1					91	96		10.1071/MF99004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF99004													WOS:000085100100010

Based on an aerial photo analysis, four classes of forest density were distinguished. For independent comparison, also one fully polarimetric EMISAR C-band image, including the VV polarization signatures was analyzed. It was found that the differences between the classes were quite consistent throughout the seasons and therefore probably significant, at least in a relative sense. The same images were also studied to determine the sensitivity of backscattering properties of lake surfaces to regional winds. For this purpose the backscattering values of five lakes within the study area were analyzed. It was found that the five lake surfaces behaved very similar, except for one observation date. This behavior, therefore, seems to be dominated by regional scale wind fields, although local scale wind fields also may have an effect. Since regional and local scale wind fields are difficult to observe in a synoptic way, the use of radar might have potential for monitoring such wind fields in the Swedish boreal region, which is characterized by the occurrence of many lakes.

Thousands of natural and man-made waterbodies of this region are ideal reservoirs for combined fish and makhana cultivation which is a major source of livelihood for fishermen. E. ferox is an important ingredient of Hindu ritualistic oblations despite the fact that it finds no mention in old Sanskrit scriptures. The plant is unusual in having both cleistogamous and chasmogamous flowers. The seeds are edible and very nutritious. The expenditure incurred over its cultivation is modest as the seeds left over after harvest germinate the next season. The only labour involves some thinning out of overgrowths, transplanting into sparse areas, the collection of dispersed seeds from the pond bed during harvest and their preparation for sale. Calorific values of the edible seeds correspond well with most staple food materials including wheat, rice and other carbohydrate-rich cereals. Despite its low protein percentage (10-12%), it is superior to most plant- and animal-based diets as evidence by its high essential amino acid index (89-93%) and arginine + lysine/proline ratio (4.74-7.6). According to traditional systems of Indian medicine E. ferox possesses medicinal properties against a number of human ailments involving respiratory, circulatory, digestive, renal and reproductive systems. Small starch grain dimensions (1-3-mu-m) make it effective against digestive disorders. Early tender leaves of the crop require protection from the leaf-rolling larval pests of Nymphula crisonalis Walker as well as aphids identified as Rhopalosiphum nymphaeae Linnaeus which can damage the crop in epiphytotic proportions. Roots also are heavily damaged by Donacia sp. A thrips known as Frankliniella intonsa Trybom damages the flowers, while Bagous vicinus Hustache, a weevil, destroys fruits by making holes in the pods. Synchytrium sp., a phycomycetous fungus, produces galls on its mature leaves. Tyrophagus putrescientiae Schrank, a mite, damages the stored seeds. Two beetles, Menochilus sexmaculata Fabricius and Scymnus sp. have been identified as predators attacking nymphs and adults of R. nymphaeae. The identity of a number of other insect associations has yet to be established. E. ferox has become extinct in the temperature lakes of Kashmir and has become rare in the contemporaneous flora of Eurasia. Major parts of the flood-ravaged north-eastern districts of North Bihar have witnessed a virtual root-out of the crop on account of sand filling of the beds of water bodies. Detailed investigations of different dietary components of the seeds of E. ferrox are highly desirable in order to assess its proper nutritional significance. This becomes more relevant in view of the imminent future dependence on aquatic bodies for food and forage prospects.																			0304-3770	1879-1522				MAR	1991	39	3-4					295	314		10.1016/0304-3770(91)90005-P	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(91)90005-P													WOS:A1991FE14200005
J	WILSON, SD				WILSON, SD			PLASTICITY, MORPHOLOGY AND DISTRIBUTION IN 12 LAKESHORE PLANTS	OIKOS												The ecological significance of plasticity in twelve lakeshore plant species was investigated by examining the relationship of plasticity to growth form, competitive ability and position along an environmental gradient of soil organic matter content. Study species occupied different positions along the gradient and had a variety of growth forms, including basal rosettes, creeping graminoids, and stemmed, leafy dicots. Plasticity was measured in plants grown singly along an experimental gradient of soil organic matter content for one growing season. The degree of plasticity exhibited by a species was not significantly related to its competitive ability measured in a diallel experiment. Nor was plasticity related to position on the environmental gradient, although species of sandy soils tended to be more plastic than those of organic soils. Plasticity was significantly greater in monocots than dicots, and species differed in characters displaying plasticity along the experimental gradient. All four rosette species responded to increased soil organic matter by increasing leaf mass while holding ramet number constant, whereas other species increased ramet number. Species also differed in the direction of plastic response: root: shoot ratios had positive, negative, quadratic or non-significant relationships to the experimental gradient depending on the species considered. Because the species differed in the characters displaying plasticity, and in the strength and direction of plasticity, the most important ecological feature of phenotypic plasticity in this community may be the individuality of species responses.

J	Küçükuysal, C; Yavuz, N				Kucukuysal, Ceren; Yavuz, Nurdan			Multi-proxy records of Quaternary fluvio-lacustrine sediments around Lakes Eymir and Mogan, Ankara (Central Anatolia, Turkey)	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												This paper presents the mineralogical, geochemical, palynological and stable isotopic compositions of the Late Pleistocene-Holocene fluvio-lacustrine sediments around Lakes Eymir and Mogan (Ankara), Central Anatolia. It is based on the interpretation of the multiproxy records in conjunction with the geochronological data in eight different sections. The comparison between the increase/ decrease in the abundances of carbonates and total clay assemblages is correlated with the changing abundance of coniferous forests and herbaceous plants (mainly Asteraceae and Chenopodiaceae). delta C-13 and delta O-18 values and molecular weathering ratios of the sediments revealing the hydrolysis, evaporation and leaching together with chemical index of alteration (CIA) provide insight into the climatic changes in the study area between 11,899 and 1428 cal year BP. Relatively higher total clay amount, delta O-18 of around -8% and higher CIA (>40%) with higher hydrolysis suggest humid conditions during 11,899-6448 cal year BP. Between 6448 and 5763 cal year BP, sediments show oscillations between high and relatively low values of the proxy data implying intercalation of dry and wet seasons. The last period recorded between 5763 and 1428 cal year BP is realized with high calcite precipitation-low total clay and low CIA and relatively higher salinization which directly characterize aridity.

J	Cohen, SJ; Allsopp, TR				Cohen, S. J.; Allsopp, T. R.			The Potential Impacts of a Scenario of CO2-Induced Climatic Change on Ontario, Canada	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												In 1984, Environment Canada, Ontario Region, with financial and expert support from the Canadian Climate Program, initiated an interdisciplinary pilot study to investigate the potential impact, on Ontario, of a climate scenario which might be anticipated under doubling of atmospheric CO2 conditions. There were many uncertainties involved in the climate scenario development and the impacts modeling. Time and resource constraints restricted this study to one climate scenario and to the selection of several available models that could be adapted to these impact studies. The pilot study emphasized the approach and process required to investigate potential regional impacts in an interdisciplinary manner, rather than to produce a forecast of the future. The climate scenario chosen was adapted from experimental model results produced by the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), coupled with current climate normals. Gridded monthly mean temperatures and precipitation were then used to develop projected biophysical effects. For example, existing physical and/or statistical models were adapted to determine impacts on the Great Lakes net basin supplies, levels and outflows, streamflow subbasin, snowfall and length of snow season. The second phase of the study addressed the impacts of the climate system scenario on natural resources and resource dependent activities. For example, the impacts of projected decreased lake levels and outflows on commercial navigation and hydroelectric generation were assessed. The impacts of the climate scenario on municipal water use, residential heating and cooling energy requirements, opportunities and constraints for food production and tourism and recreation were determined quantitatively where models and methodologies were available, otherwise, qualitatively. First order interdependencies of the biophysical effects of the climate scenario and resource dependent activities were evaluated qualitatively in a workshop format culminating in a series of statements on (i) possible preventive, compensatory and substitution strategies and (ii) an assessment of current knowledge gaps and deficiencies, with recommendations for future areas of research.																			0894-8755	1520-0442				JUL	1988	1	7					669	681		10.1175/1520-0442(1988)001<0669:TPIOAS>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0442(1988)001<0669:TPIOAS>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000208483000001

Ammonia volatilization is one of the most loss of nitrogen from rice paddy and sources of atmospheric nitrogen. In order to quantify the nitrogen wet deposition and its correlation with ammonia volatilization losses from rice paddy during rice growth season, field experiments were carried out in high nitrogen input rice paddy in Taihu Lake region. Total wet deposition of total nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen are 16.04kg.hm(-2), 7.40kg.hm(-2) and 3.39kg.hm(-2) in rice growth season. It equals to 37.7kg.hm(-2) urea inputs to rice paddy and takes 3835t total nitrogen, 1730t ammonia and 793t nitrate into surface water of Taihu lake. Seasonal ammonia volatilization is estimated to be 95.21kg.hm(-2), account for 23.6% of seasonal total nitrogen inputs. Urea applications leads to the sharply increase in ammonia volatilization, more than 90% ammonia volatilization emission occurs within one week after urea fertilization. Ammonia and total nitrogen contents in rainfall water are likely relevant to the fertilizer management, but ammonia and total nitrogen were determined both by the precipitation volumes and the nitrogen fertilizer management. Total nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen contents in rainfall water are confirmed high relative to synchronous three-day ammonia volatilization, but not nitrogen wet deposition. Controlled-release urea reduced seasonal ammonia volatilization to 28.97 kg.hm(-2), it is reduced by 69.6% when compared with traditional urea. Widely application of controlled-release urea is efficient to cut off the ammonia volatilization and hence the nitrogen wet deposition.					; xu, junzeng/I-9266-2014	Peng, Shizhang/0000-0002-1530-8329; Xu, Junzeng/0000-0003-1467-7883; 															978-0-7695-3819-8				2009							633	636		10.1109/ICEET.2009.391	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICEET.2009.391													WOS:000275392500155

Both Chlorobium phaeobacteroides and Rhodopseudomonas palustris were detected from mid-June through October in 1987 and reached a maximum of 7 x 10(6) cells/ml in the metalimnion by mid-August. Chlorobium density was greater towards the end of the bloom period, when the thermocline was exposed to higher sulfide concentrations and lower light intensities. Rhodopseudomonas peaked earlier in the season, when less sulphide was present and light irradiation was higher. This was the first time that R. palustris was observed in Lake Kinneret; in addition to its presence at the thermocline, it was found also at the epilimnion and hypolimnion. The contribution of photosynthetic bacteria to the total primary productivity of the lake was small (approximately 1%). Low but perceptible rates of N2 fixation in situ were also demonstrated by photosynthetic bacteria present in the metalimnion.																			0018-8158					APR 24	1992	232	3					193	200		10.1007/BF00013704	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00013704													WOS:A1992JA10200002

A numerical model for calculation of daily and annual nitrogen fixation in lakes is presented. The model is based on empirically-derived equations for the rates of nitrogen fixation by heterocysts (nitrogen-fixing cells) in relation to light and on functions for the vertical and temporal distributions of heterocysts and light in a lake. 2. Applications of the model to Lake Valencia, Venezuela, between December 1980 and December 1981 indicated that nitrogen fixation is largely a surface phenomenon on this lake: 80% of diurnal fixation occurred within 1 m of the water surface. 3. Nitrogen fixation is largely restricted to periods of lake stratification, when the phytoplankton have sufficient light for growth, but dissolved inorganic nitrogen is scarce. Nitrogen fixation was maximal late in the stratification period of 1981: 85% of fixation occurred within the last 3 months of the 9-month period. 4. The annual nitrogen fixation in Lake Valencia is 26 kg ha-1, which is comparable to the nitrogen fixation in temperate eutrophic lakes with seasonal blue-green algal blooms. However, nitrogen fixation accounted for only 23% of the total nitrogen supply to Lake Valencia in 1981.

These changes were probably caused by increased population density and connected with density dependent growth as well as sharpened inter- and intraspecific competition in the cyprinid community. According to the frequency of occurrence, zooplankton followed by benthic invertebrates comprised the majority of the bream's food. By weight, however, benthic food dominated in both basins. Size-related dietary changes were pronounced, but statistically not always significant, suggesting the overall importance of the most abundant and available prey types. Bream did not strongly select any of the zooplankton groups, however, seasonal changes in food composition alternated in parallel with the trophic gradient along the longitudinal axis of the lake.																			0018-8158					FEB 1	1991	209	1					51	58		10.1007/BF00006717	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00006717													WOS:A1991EX75200006

Similarly catches within the habitats during the periods of wet (May to October) and dry (November to April) seasons were not significantly different. There was seasonal occurrence of the fish at the bottom because the catches from this habitat in October (4.80 to 9.10 %) and November (0.00 to 8.70 %), corresponding with the period of flood and high water levels, were relatively low due to feeding and reproductive phenomena. Although catch was inversely proportional to the water levels, this was not significant in this experimental gill net catches. Synodontis schall was caught throughout the sampling period indicating its;successful adaptation within the environment due to low predation and its diverse feeding habits.																			0034-7744					DEC	1999	47	4					1061	1066																WOS:000087753500041

Overflow from Lake Victoria and severe floods in Egypt heralded the change in Nile regime.																			0028-0836	1476-4687					1980	288	5786					50	55		10.1038/288050a0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/288050a0													WOS:A1980KP30000023
J	TILZER, MM				TILZER, MM			THE IMPORTANCE OF FRACTIONAL LIGHT-ABSORPTION BY PHOTOSYNTHETIC PIGMENTS FOR PHYTOPLANKTON PRODUCTIVITY IN LAKE CONSTANCE	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The role of light interception by photosynthetic pigments on the productivity of phytoplankton was studied year-round in mesotrophic Lake Constance. The phytoplankton showed wide seasonal fluctuations in both biomass [Chl a (chlorophyll a)] and photosynthesis. Linear regression was used to determine pigment-specific light attenuation and nonalgal light extinction. Fractional light absorption by photosynthetic pigments ranged from 4-70%. Pheopigments comprised 27.4 .+-. 8.2% of total pigments. Since pheopigments do not transfer energy to the photosystems, their light absorption must be added to the background light attenuation by nonphotosynthetic material. If pheopigments are considered, estimates of fractional light absorption decrease accordingly. A plot of integral photosynthesis vs. maximum photosynthesis at the depth of the optimum light intensity gives a saturation curve, due to increasing fractional light absorbance by photosynthetic pigments at rising concentrations of biomass. Integral photosynthesis would reach a theoretical upper limit if all light were absorbed by active photosynthetic pigments. Since pheopigment concentrations usually rise with active Chl a, background light attenuation increases also, leading to diminished productivity per unit of lake surface area.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1983	28	5					833	846		10.4319/lo.1983.28.5.0833	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1983.28.5.0833													WOS:A1983RN42600003

Evaluation of the Health Status of the Silverside (Odontesthes bonariensis) at a RAMSAR Site in South America	BULLETIN OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												The objective of this work was to evaluate the health status of an economic and ecologically important fish species from Mar Chiquita Lake, a RAMSAR site located in Cordoba, Argentina, relative to the levels of selected persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in lake water and fish tissues. Odontesthes bonariensis was used as a model species, and its health was estimated by means of histological indices in gills and liver. Sampling was performed according to rainy and dry seasons (i.e. dry, rainy and post-rainy). Gill and liver histopathology were evaluated by semi-quantitative indices and morphometric analysis. Although epithelial lifting in gills and lipid degeneration in liver were frequently registered, they are considered as reversible if environmental conditions improve. During rainy and post-rainy seasons fish presented significantly higher scores of liver and total indices. These higher index scores were correlated with increased levels of POPs in gill and liver tissue. Therefore, preventive measures are needed to mitigate the entry of these compounds into the lake.

The aim of the present work therefore was to determine the reproductive features of the catfish, Hassar affinis, known locally as bico-de-flor, in three lakes of the Pindare-Mearim Lake System, in the state of Maranhao, with the aim of subsidising the closed season. Monthly collections were carried out between July 2014 and July 2015, when 206 individuals were sampled from Lake Aquiri (LA), 247 from Lake Cajari (LC), and 126 from Lake Viana (LV). In the laboratory, each individual was weighed and measured; a ventral longitudinal incision was then made in order to observe the gonads macroscopically. They were then fixed in Bouin's solution for microscopic analysis and in Gilson's solution for an analysis of fecundity. Positive allometry was recorded at the three study sites. The sex ratio for the total period was 3.29F:1M (LA), 2.43F:1M (LC) and 2.15F:1M (LV). Mean length at first sexual maturity was estimated at 10.60 cm (LA), 10.84 cm (LC) and 11.12 cm (LV). The period from March to May was defined as the breeding season for this species in the three lakes. Mean absolute fecundity was 21,634 oocytes (LA), 16,357 oocytes (LC) and 25,898 oocytes (LV). The information obtained through this study indicates that, in addition to being important spawning areas, the three lakes are interconnected in relation to the migratory dynamics of H. affinis, so it is necessary to arrive at a model that would satisfactorily cover the three lakes, considering that the dam has a negative effect on Lake Viana.					; Almeida, Zafira/I-3116-2012; Cantanhede, Lorrane/Y-4095-2019	Bittencourt Nunes Queiros, Karla/0000-0001-9176-8477; da Silva de Almeida, Zafira/0000-0002-8295-5040; Cantanhede, Lorrane/0000-0001-7796-9416; da Silva Carvalho, Irayana Fernanda/0000-0002-4971-9804; 													0045-6888	1806-6690				JUL-SEP	2017	48	3					464	472		10.5935/1806-6690.20170054	http://dx.doi.org/10.5935/1806-6690.20170054													WOS:000402469800009

In this paper, we show how sensitive calculation of the latter is to the quality of data available and assumptions made during analysis. Based on the collection of a large new dataset, we quantify the sediment masses (1) mobilized on the hillslopes draining towards Lake Tana (Ethiopia), (2) stored in the floodplains, (3) transported into the lake, (4) deposited in the lake, and (5) delivered out from the lake so as to establish a sediment budget. In 2012-2013, suspended sediment concentration (SSC) and discharge measurements were made at 13 monitoring stations, including two lake outlets. 4635 SSC samples were collected and sediment rating curves that account for land cover conditions and rainfall seasonality were established for the 11 river stations, and mean monthly SSC was calculated for the outlets. Effects of the floodplain on rivers' sediment yield (SY) were investigated using measurements at both sides of the floodplains. SY from ungauged rivers was assessed using a model that includes catchment area and rainfall, whereas bedload and direct sediment input from lake shores were estimated. As a result, the gross annual SY was c. 3.20 (+/- 0.20) Mt, dominantly from Gilgel Abay and Gumara Rivers. The 0.48 (+/- 0.15) Mt sediment deposited in floodplains indicate that the floodplains serve as an important sediment sink. Moreover, annually c. 1.09 Mt of sediment leaves the lake through the two outlets. Annual sediment deposition in the lake was ca. 1.63 (+/- 0.25) Mt and organic matter accumulation was 0.1 (+/- 0.02) Mt, with a mean sediment trapping efficiency of 56-63%. Furthermore, SSC and SY are generally higher at the beginning of the rainy season because soils in cultivated fields are bare and loose due to frequent ploughing and seedbed preparation. Later on in the season, increased crop and vegetation cover lead to a decrease in sediment production. Based on the established sediment budget with average rainfall, the lifetime of Lake Tana was estimated at 14 475 to 19 805 years, which is longer than was anticipated in earlier studies. The sedimentation rate of Lake Tana (568 +/- 83 g m(-2) y(-1)) is in line with the sedimentation rates of larger lakes in the world except Lake Dongting and Lake Kivu.

J	MATSUBARA, T				MATSUBARA, T			ROTIFER COMMUNITY STRUCTURE IN THE SOUTH BASIN OF LAKE BIWA	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Seasonal changes in abundance and species composition of rotifers were surveyed at five locations under different physical and chemical conditions in the south basin of Lake Biwa during July 1987-June 1988. Total density of rotifers showed similar seasonal fluctuation with three peaks, although the maximum density showed north (low)-south (high) gradient. Polyarthra spp. (P. vulgaris and P. dolichoptera with low density) dominated except during July-October 1987 and April-May 1988. In the former period the species of Brachionus, Trichocerca, Filinia and Hexarthra, and in the latter, those of Synchaeta, Keratella and Kellicottia had somewhat different proportions in the communities of north and south stations, respectively. The difference in composition during July-October suggests a difference of trophic state between the northern and southern areas in the south basin of Lake Biwa. However, the dominance of Polyarthra and the difference in the composition during April-May 1988 could not be explained by such a difference in trophic state. No critical difference was observed in the community structure of the eastern area of the south basin, where the seasonal fluctuations in nutrient levels and phytoplankton community structure were different from other areas in the south basin. The present results, therefore, suggest that physical and chemical conditions were not effective in controlling the rotifer community structure in the south basin of Lake Biwa.																			0018-8158					NOV 5	1993	271	1					1	10		10.1007/BF00005690	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00005690													WOS:A1993MV39000001

The relationship between mean air temperature (X) and mean water temperature (Y) was approximately linear, except in the Pennine streams for periods when mean air temperature was below 0.degree. C. The calculated regressions of mean water temperature upon mean air temperature accounted for 86-96% of the variance of water temperature, even when the air and water temperatures were measured at stations some 50 km apart. A negligible improvement was obtained by the use of multiple regressions incorporating rainfall or stream discharge from a nearby metering weir. Predicted water temperatures were lower than observed values during the 1st half of the calendar year and higher during the 2nd half, but these seasonal differences could not be adequately quantified for practical application.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1982	12	4					359	367		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1982.tb00629.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1982.tb00629.x													WOS:A1982NZ70300006

The phytoplankton biomass had two maxima during the year. The first occurred during the rainy season, lasted for 3-4 months and comprised to 70-90% of Cyanophyceae with Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii as the dominating species. Sub-dominant during this period were Dinophyceae. The second maximum developed during turnover at the cool season, lasted 1-2 months and comprised of Bacillariophyceae with a number of Synedra spp. as dominants. The mean yearly biomass was 310 mg .cntdot. m-3 wet weight and was in the same order as for the large natural tropical lakes. The succession and composition of phytoplankton in Lake Kariba fits into a general picture for tropical lakes where the stability of stratification seems to be the decisive factor.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				OCT 30	1987	153	3					193	202		10.1007/BF00007206	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00007206													WOS:A1987K099000001
J	Irvine, RL; Crone, EE; Jackson, LJ; MacIsaac, EA				Irvine, RL; Crone, EE; Jackson, LJ; MacIsaac, EA			Does scale affect ecological model predictions? A test with lake responses to fertilization	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Ecosystem ecologists often face the challenge of predicting long-term consequences of perturbations such as nutrient enrichment from shorter term experiments. In such experiments, the spatial and temporal scale at which data are analyzed can directly impact extrapolations to larger scales. Here, we assess the level of data resolution required to answer qualitative and quantitative questions about primary production in a set of lake ecosystems. We tested the ability of 40 models containing variable levels of spatial and temporal complexity to (1) fit the relationship between light and primary productivity in a set of 14 British Columbia (Canada) lakes that were part of a large-scale fertilization experiment, and (2) predict annual primary production. The experimental data had previously been averaged across fertilization treatments for analysis, effectively ignoring spatial and temporal variation. In the limnological literature, data from whole-lake experiments are often analyzed for each lake to account for among-lake differences, or analyzed for each lake in each year to account for both lake effect and interannual variation. Using an information-theoretic approach, we tested these three models ("fertilization status only," "lake only," and "lake and year") against models that included less and more spatial and temporal partitioning of the data. We fit a Monod function to light and primary productivity at 40 spatial and temporal levels of data resolution and ranked the model fits using the second-order Akaike Information Criterion (AIC(c)). The "fertilization status only" model ranked 37th out of 40 models tested, the "lake only" model ranked 27th, and the "lake and year" model ranked 25th. The top-ranked model partitioned the data by lake, year, fertilization status, season, and sampling station, and fit the data substantially better than other models. We then calculated primary production with independent light data and the fitted model parameters to compare the top three models from our AIC(c) ranking and the "lake only," "lake and year," and "fertilization status only" models. The predicted production differed depending on the model, but all models predicted higher net primary productivity in fertilized lakes. Model selection is therefore important for quantitative predictions, but not necessarily for qualitative assessment of nutrient limitation.

The isotopic compositions were converted into the composition of drinking water, ultimately originating from the Nile. O-18 values decrease during ontogeny; this is mainly related to breastfeeding and physiology. Those of neonates present very large variations. Neonates have a very high bone turnover and are thus able to record seasonal O-18 variations of the Nile waters. These variations followed a pattern very similar to the present one. Nile O-18 values increased from 1.4 to 4.4 parts per thousand (Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water) from the Classic Kerma (approximate to 3500 BP) through the Christian period (approximate to 1000 BP), traducing a progressive drying of Northeast Africa.					; Amiot, Romain/C-8132-2012; FOUREL, Francois/G-6734-2015; Royer, Aurélien/L-4641-2018; Lecuyer, Christophe/AAO-8154-2021; Flandrois, Jean-Pierre/F-6861-2019	Panczer, Gerard/0000-0001-5708-6376; Amiot, Romain/0000-0003-2779-9652; Maureille, Bruno/0000-0002-7616-0073; Flandrois, Jean-Pierre/0000-0002-4953-9125													1025-6016	1477-2639				JUN	2017	53	3					223	242		10.1080/10256016.2016.1229667	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10256016.2016.1229667								28276733					WOS:000399471500001

Changes of the Phytoplankton Abundance and Structure in the Biosphere Reserve Srebarna (Northeastern Bulgaria) in Relation to Some Environmental Variables	ACTA ZOOLOGICA BULGARICA												Phytoplankton of the Srebarna Lake was investigated during the period from 2002 to 2005 in respect to the total numbers, biomass and taxonomical structure. The interannual, spatial and seasonal variability of the different algal groups in relation with changes of the main chemical and physical factors were separately examined by means of RDA analysis. Interannual changes were the most pronounced and the main explanatory factor was the change of the water level. The increase of water level causes a decline of the total phytoplankton numbers and biomass, decrease of the share of Cyanophyta to the total biomass and its substitution by Cryptophyta. Pyrrhophyta showed strongly negative and Cryptophyta strongly positive relation with the water level. Total phytoplankton biomass showed a positive correlation with NO(3)-N on interannual basis. Chlorophyta and Cryptophyta were positively related to NH(4)-N. Despite the shallowness and polymictic character of the lake, the stratification is also found to be an important factor for the phytoplankton development.																			0324-0770					NOV	2008							165	174																WOS:000264562500021

Srebarna Lake Plankton Primary Production and Factors Influencing Its Seasonal and Annual Variations	ACTA ZOOLOGICA BULGARICA												The Plankton primary productivity of the riparian Srebarna Lake (Lower Danube, river km 391-393) was investigated before and after its reconnection to the river by means of oxygen method (light and dark bottle technique). In the period before the lake water level was significantly lower (11-12 m above sea level) and the gross primary production was higher (970 g C m(-2) a(-1), high hypertrophy) than in the period after (11.5-15 m a.s.l., 360-430 g C m(-2) a(-1), low hypertrophy). In the period after the reconnection the seasonal variations of gross primary production and respiration per m(2) or per m(3) in the layer of maximal photosynthesis had been influenced significantly by the water temperature and transparency measured by Secchi disk, while the annual changes depended on lake water level and nitrate concentration. The nitrogen as a nutrient was limiting the algal growth instead of phosphorus. The achieved trophy decrease is beyond doubt, however, further improvement of the lake ecological status is possible and still highly desirable.																			0324-0770					NOV	2008				2			185	192																WOS:000264562500023

Adult males held small territories of 0.5 ha on average during the mating season. The territorial grounds were located according to the ranging behavior of females. Males held clustered or individual mating territories in areas frequented by females. Male territoriality showed daily fluctuation following the change in female density within males' territories. Our findings provide strong evidence that male spatial behaviour in the mating season is primarily determined by female distribution pattern in the water deer.																			0044-3468					MAR	1995	60	1					33	40																WOS:A1995QM17500004

In contrast to temperate lakes that have diurnal photic periods, antarctic (and arctic) lakes have a yearly photic period. An unusual feature of the antarctic lakes is the occurrence of O2 at supersaturated levels in certain portions of the water column. Here we report the first sediment O2 profiles obtained using a microelectrode from a perennially ice-covered antarctic lake. Sediment cores collected in January and October 1987 from Lake Hoare in Taylor Valley show oxygenation down to 15, and in some cases, 25 cm. The oxygenation of sediments several centimeters below the sediment-water interface is atypical for lake sediments and may be characteristic of perennially ice-covered lakes. There is a significant difference between the observed January and October sediment O2 profiles. Several explanations may account for the difference, including seasonality. A time-dependent model is presented which tests the feasibility of a seasonal cycle resulting from the long photoperiod and benthic primary production in sediments overlain by a highly oxygenated water column.					; Mancinelli, Rocco/L-8971-2016; Meyer, Marion/E-3042-2010	McKay, Christopher/0000-0002-6243-1362; 													0024-3590					JUN	1994	39	4					839	853		10.4319/lo.1994.39.4.0839	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1994.39.4.0839								11539366					WOS:A1994PC98200007

J	SMITH, REH; MARY, JA				SMITH, REH; MARY, JA			PHOTOSYNTHETIC CARBON ASSIMILATION AND ALLOCATION BY SURFACE AND DEEP PHYTOPLANKTON IN COLPOYS BAY (WESTERN GEORGIAN BAY)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												We used reciprocal shift experiments to test the hypothesis that surface (i.e., epilimnetic) and deep (i.e., metalimnetic) phytoplankton from thermally stratified Colpoys Bay (Georgian Bay) would differ in their photosynthetic and biosynthetic patterns. A deep chlorophyll maximum existed in the metalimnion during the first half of the stratified season. Surface phytoplankton always had higher light-saturated rates of photosynthesis (P-m(B)) and photoadaptation parameters (l(k)) than did deep phytoplankton, but most of the difference was due to the proximate effect of temperature on P-m(B), and not to true photoadaptation. Neither sensitivity to photoinhibition (limited) nor light-utilization efficiency (alpha) varied between surface and deep populations. Depth-related differences in photosynthate allocation to protein, total lipid, neutral lipid, and phospholipid were significant according to ANOVA but were nonetheless small compared with other sources of variation. Photosynthetic rates were generally low, while allocation to polysaccharide and neutral lipid was large, suggesting a relatively poor physiological condition of the phytoplankton. Short-term dynamics (days to weeks) of water masses in Colpoys Bay, and probably many other nearshore Great Lakes locations, appear sufficient to preclude strong vertical differentiation of phytoplankton physiology.

Major processes incorporated are different hydrologic flow patterns during highflow and lowflow, SO42- adsorption/desorption, ion exchange, weathering, gibbsite solubility, and equilibria with CO2 in soil and stream water. The model reproduces important daily and seasonal trends in the observed streamwater chemistry. Tentative model runs have been carried out to simulate the effects of both a doubling and a 50% reduction in the present sulphur deposition. At present the pH of the stream is generally above 5.7, with values approaching pH 5.3 during snowmelt highflow. According to the simulations, lowflow pH is not sensitive to changes in deposition. At snowmelt highflow, however, a 50% reduction in the deposition could cause a pH increase of 0.2-0.5 unit whereas a doubling could result in pH depressions of 0.5-0.9 unit.

J	Davis, JG				Davis, JG			Provision of mid-season potassium requirements in cotton with slow release potassium applied preplant	JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION												Mid-season development of potassium (K) deficiency in cotton is related to the high K demand during flowering and high rainfall, particularly on sandy soils, removing available K prior to peak demand. Slow-release K sources have potential for supplying mid-season K requirements of cotton without having to expend additional labor and fuel applying sidedress or foliar K in mid-season. The objective of this study was to determine the potential for slow-release K applied preplant in combination with muriate of potash (KCI) for meeting mid-season K requirements of cotton. Tests were conducted on 'Georgia King' cotton grown on three soil types in the Coastal Plain region of Georgia: 1992-1993 on a Greenville sandy clay loam (Rhodic Kandiudults), 1994 on a Tifton sandy loam (Plinthic Kandiudults), and 1993 on a Lakeland sand (Typic Quartzipsamments). Three K rates were applied (0, 55, and 110 kg K2O/ha), and two K sources were utilized, KCl (muriate of potash; 0-0-60) and Multi-cote 4 slow-release fertilizer (9-0-32). Five combinations of the potash sources were applied broadcast pre-plant and tillivated in: ratios of 1:0, 3:1, 2:2, 1:3, and 0:1 soluble:slow release. Petioles were sampled from first bloom to cutout, and soil samples were taken after harvest; nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) and K concentrations were measured. Results varied depending on soil texture. The best yielding treatments on the Lakeland sand were the 55 kg K2O/ha treatment with either a 2:2 or 0:1 soluble:slow release ratio. The 55 kg K2O/ha treatment with 0:1 soluble:slow release ratio also had the highest lint percentage. On the Greenville and Tifton soils, the 110 kg K2O/ha treatment control. As the slow-release percentage increased, there was a trend for soil K to increase as well. In general, use of soluble K led to higher petiole K levels early in the season and lower petiole levels in late season as compared to slow release K. Petiole NO3-N concentration tended to increase with application of the slow-release K material, particularly in the early to mid-sampling periods, due to its 9% nitrogen (N) content. Slow-release K has the greatest potential for reducing K deficiency and improving cotton yields on soils with high yield potential but with low K-supplying capacity, either due to low buffering capacity or high leaching losses.

J	LORENTE, MA				LORENTE, MA			TEXTURAL CHARACTERISTICS OF ORGANIC-MATTER IN SEVERAL SUBENVIRONMENTS OF THE ORINOCO UPPER DELTA	GEOLOGIE EN MIJNBOUW-NETHERLANDS JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												Four subenvironments (oxbow lake, back swamp/flood basin, crevasse splay, natural levee) from the Orinoco Upper Delta plain were sampled for quantitative analysis of organic matter. Each subenvironment has been characterized on the basis of two main criteria: organic matter composition and textural characteristics. The Oxbow lake model has two main subdivisions related to the influence of the dry and rainy seasons on the organic assemblages. The rainy season assemblages are rich in light-coloured organic matter, with abundant fungal and insect remains, are usually coarse grained, and have a highly variable particle shape. The dry season assemblages are relative poor, the organic matter is darker and the finest grain size is scarcely represented. The Montrichardia backswamp/flood basin model is also related to the flood-and the dry periods of the basin. Dry periods in the flood basin are characterized by very poor organic matter assemblages consisting of fine grains of woody and humic gels. The flood stages are characterized by a very high content of organic remains of variable composition. The crevasse splay model assemblage is characterized by a strong bimodal distribution of the grain size, and by fluctuations in the amount of organic matter preserved at different levels of the fan. The natural levee model assemblage is highly variable in the organic matter content and composition, and shows a wide range of particle grain sizes varying from medium sand to clay.

Nanoplankton generally, but not always, had a higher uptake of NH4+ and NO3- than did net plankton. NH4+ was always taken up preferentially and the phytoplankton had lower apparent affinity constants (Ks) for this ion than for NO3-. During the annual dinoflagellate bloom of Peridinium (Feb.-May), when ambient levels of NH4+ were low and those of NO3- were high, a considerable portion of the total N flux was derived from NO3-. The observed daily fluctuations of specific uptake rates for both NH4+ and NO3- can be partially explained by changes in light intensity. The finding that NO3- was utilized by the dinoflagellates implies that control of the amounts of this nutrient, which is predominantly supplied from watershed sources, could be important in limiting eutrophication in Lake Kinneret.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1984	29	2					287	297		10.4319/lo.1984.29.2.0287	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1984.29.2.0287													WOS:A1984SL26300006
J	Gammie, AJ; WynJones, AP				Gammie, AJ; WynJones, AP			Does hepatitis A pose a significant health risk to recreational water users?	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY					8th Symposium of the Health-Related-Water-Microbiology-Group of the IAWQ	OCT, 1996	MALLORCA, SPAIN	IAWQ, Hlth Related Water Microbiol Grp				In recent years recreational water use in the UK has increased dramatically and it has been estimated that more than twenty million people use the British coastline annually. In addition, there has been a marked increase in the number of people who use inland water e.g. lakes, reservoirs, rivers and canals. The ready availability of the wet suit has altered the public use of recreational water in several ways in the UK. Longer periods of immersion are now becoming normal with year-round activity now common not just during the accepted bathing season of May-September. Further factors that raise the importance of health implications are the growth of sports which involve intimate contact with water: surfing, windsurfing and boogie boarding. The raised public awareness of environmental issues in general makes health risk assessment a prime concern. Hepatitis A virus infection is transmitted by the faecal-oral route and this study compares two groups of water users, surfers and inland windsurfers. Saliva samples were rested for total antibody to hepatitis A as this indicates the immune status of the individual. All participants completed a questionnaire that elicited concomitant risk factors for previous exposure to hepatitis A. A calculated Odds Ratio of 3.03 and a Chi square of 5.3 with a probability of P = 0.02 was obtained when the non-immunised surfers were compared with the non-immunised windsurfers. This shows a statistical correlation between surfing and exposure to hepatitis A virus. It is recommended that surfers should be offered vaccination in order that they are protected from the risk of acquiring hepatitis A. They should also be given the opportunity to make a considered decision about the risks of acquiring hepatitis A recreationally. (C) 1997 IAWQ.

J	PintoCoelho, RM; DeMoura, RT; Moreira, A				PintoCoelho, RM; DeMoura, RT; Moreira, A			Zooplankton and bacteria contribution to phosphorus and nitrogen internal cycling in a tropical and eutrophic reservoir: Pampulha lake, Brazil	INTERNATIONALE REVUE DER GESAMTEN HYDROBIOLOGIE												Nutrient regeneration and respiration rates of natural zooplankton from a tropical reservoir were experimentally measured. Excretion rates of ammonia (E-a), orthophosphate (E-p) and community respiration rates (R) were estimated considering the variations in the concentrations of ammonia, orthophosphate and dissolved oxygen between control and experimental units. The ranges obtained for these rates from the 2 h assays were E-a = 1.95-4.95 mu g N-NH4.mg.DW-1.h(-1); E-p = 0.12-0.76 mu g P-PO4 mg DW-1.h(-1). Respiratory rates were quite constant (R = 0.01-0.02 mg O-2.mg DW-1.h(-1)). The uptake of nutrients due to bacteria can affect the experimental determination of excretion rates of zooplankton. Orthophosphate release increased from 0.28 to 0.82 mu g P-PO4.mg DW-1.h(-1) when bacterial activity was depleted by antibiotic addition in experimental vessels (Exp IV). This demonstrates that free living bacteria are able to consume promptly most phosphorus excreted by zooplankton. Ammonia excretion rates were lower in experimental units containing antibiotics. Lower excretion rates were also obtained with longer exposure times and higher biomass levels in the experimental units. Finally, this study also showed that zooplankton excretion can affect significantly turn over rates of total phosphorus in Pampulha Reservoir. In some periods, specially during the dry season when zooplankton biomass was very high, phosphorus release by zooplankton, during one single day, can be as high as 40% of the total phosphorus content in lake water (Turn over time = 2.5 days).

In the experiments, individual growth during postembryonic development was monitored at 4 different temperatures (10.degree. C, 15.degree. C, 20.degree. C, and 25.degree. C, all at a salinity of 8 .times. 10-3) and at 3 salinities (S = 4 .times. 10-3, S = 8 .times. 10-3 and S = 16 .times. 10-3, all at 20.degree. C). Animals [100] were subjected to each of 6 different treatments. Length and height of valves and the intermolt periods were measured. Growth was significantly affected by temperature, with animals growing more slowly at lower temperatures, but eventually attaining a larger size, except at 10.degree. C where animals grew at the slowest rate of all but remained smaller than those at 15.degree. C. Calculated length-height ratios (parameters for valve shape) were significantly different among the 4 investigated temperatures, but no clear pattern could be detected. No obvious effect of salinity on growth was observed. The length-height ratio was significantly affected by salinity; from stage 5 onward animals become more elongated at lower salinities. Measurements of valve length and height of the 8 larval stages and of the adult stage in 8 samples taken at different times of the year from Lake Bathurst (New South Wales, Australia), show that significant size differences exist in different seasons among animals in the same life stage.

These data included measurements of the conditions of 60 adults, growth and mortality measurements for .apprx. 900 chicks, 4450 nest-h of parental care observations, and the results of egg-removal experiments on 40 females. Hypotheses (7) were tested to explain the clutch size reduction: age structure, egg predation, bet-hedging, effort reallocation, most productive brood size, parental mortality and pre-egg food limitation. Each of these hypotheses is described. The pre-egg food limitation hypothesis is best able to explain the clutch size reduction at Mono Lake, although the egg-removal experiments show that the resource limitation is relative and not absolute. Clutch size variation at each site need not be viewed as the result of fine-scaled evolutionary adjustment, although the general clutch size decision machinery is presumably molded by selection. Future research must focus on the details of this clutch size decision machinery and its application to the concept of reproductive effort.																			0014-3820	1558-5646					1985	39	3					667	677		10.2307/2408661	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2408661								28561963					WOS:A1985AJY2600015

Reproductive periods of both parental species were considerably overlapping. Among 39 hybrid specimens sampled, 5 were found to be males with arrested spermatogenesis, 31 were females with abnormal gonads and 3 were structural hermaphrodites with arrested gametogenesis. In all hybrids gonad development was impaired. No ripe eggs or spermatozoa were ever observed in histological sections of the hybrid gonads. However, during the breeding season the hybrids possessed secondary sex characteristics, similar to those present in the parental species. Hybrid somatic growth was intermediate between that of the parental species. The hybrid dressing rate was also intermediate between that of the parental species.					; Stoumboudi, Maria/ABD-4515-2021	Stoumboudi, Maria/0000-0002-2173-9328; 													0175-8659					AUG	1992	8	1-4					110	121		10.1111/j.1439-0426.1992.tb00673.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0426.1992.tb00673.x													WOS:A1992JQ78700011

Examining the biota of non-modern and non-industrialised mountain lakes allowed us to reveal its background in relation to the species composition of plankton, the main groups of benthos and fishes, production potential, and seasonal dynamics of the ecosystem's basic links. Our data on pH and biota were compared with the findings of a previous study in 1986 in order to evaluate possible changes associated with probable acidification. We observed that the lakes of the Dzherginsky State Reserve have high species diversity. Despite this, they are classed as oligotrophic water-bodies with regard to the development level of their planktonic and benthic coenoses. These lakes are not polluted by anthropogenic activity and so could be considered as a pattern of ecologically pure water-bodies. It is important to add that high mountain lakes of Pribaikalye presently serve as refuges for species that were widespread during past geological epochs.

A poplar-willow-sage-grass-sedge zone began about 11,700 .+-. 260 years BP. A distinct pine and spruce rise indicates that local presence of conifers. Peace River spruce could have served as a source for spruce in the Yukon, transported by glacial meltwater conceivably as early as about 11,100 years BP. A paper birch rise and spruce decline between about 8700 and 8200 years BP is likely due to fires during a period of enhanced seasonality. It is suggested that subsequent weakening of the anticyclone associated with the Laurentide ice lengthened the growing season, permitting pine to be the major fire successor to spruce. During the pine peak ca. 7400 years BP there was no grassland over the Saddle Hills, so the Peace River grasslands cannot be explained as Hypsithermal relict vegetation. Conditions similar to the present were apparently reached by about 5000 years BP.

E. fabae populations in 1980 were moderate. Two to four applications of fenvalerate were necessary to maintain populations at the low threshold, and little benefit in increased yield was obtained compared with untreated plots. In 1981, populations were high. A systemic insecticide and two or three foliar applications were needed to maintain populations at the low density, which yielded higher than the untreated controls in each variety. Only one or two foliar sprays were required at the medium threshold. Although higher leafhopper populations occurred in these plots, yield differences between the low and medium infestation levels were small provided that fewer than one leafhopper per sweep was detected before the first trifoliate stage. Throughout these trials, higher E. fabae populations were found in 'Bush Blue Lake-94' than in 'Early Gallatin'. Yield reductions were greatest in 'Early Gallatin', however, indicating a tolerance for E. fabae injury in 'Bush Blue Lake-94'. 'Lake Superior' was intermediate in leafhopper populations and yield reduction. An action threshold of 0.5 adult per sweep before the first trifoliate and one adult per sweep or one nymph per leaf for the remainder of the season is proposed for snap beans. Intensity, duration, and time of E. fabae infestation are crucial factors in the determination of subsequent effects on crop yields. Crop variety and additional plant stress factors, including low temperature and incidence of plant disease, can also affect yield response to leafhopper damage and should be considered in management decisions.																			0022-0493					APR	1991	84	2					644	649		10.1093/jee/84.2.644	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/84.2.644													WOS:A1991FF30800048

PO43- uptake was not dependent upon PPFD at any time of the year, whereas NH4+, NO3-, and CO2 uptake were consistently dependent on PPFD over all seasons. Maximal rates of NH4+, NO3- and CO2 uptake usually occurred near 40% of surface PPFD, which corresponded to about 5 m in the lake; inhibition was evident at PPFD levels greater than 40%. NH4+, NO3- and PO43- were incorporated in the dark at measurable rates most of the year, whereas dark CO2 uptake was always near 0 relative to light uptake. CO2 and NO3- uptake were more strongly influenced by PPFD than was NH4+ uptake. The PPFD dependence of PO43-, NH4+, NO3- and CO2 uptake may affect algal growth and nutrient status by influencing the balance in diel and seasonal C:N:P uptake ratios.

J	ZAMPELLA, RA				ZAMPELLA, RA			MORPHOLOGIC AND COLOR PATTERN INDICATORS OF WATER-TABLE LEVELS IN SANDY PINELANDS SOILS	SOIL SCIENCE												Growing season (March-October) water table levels were measured over a 4-year period, and soil profiles were described along a gradient of upland to wetland pitch pine-dominated sites in the New Jersey Pinelands. These sites were associated with very poorly to somewhat poorly drained soils of the Lakewood sand catena. Although several profile attributes were more closely associated with specific ranges of water table levels, few features were limited to a specific hydrologic regime. 0 and A horizon thickness and frequency of very dark gray to black A horizons generally decreased along the wet to dry hydrosequence. E horizon thickness was variable and unrelated to water table level. Bh horizons with values and chromas of 2 or 3 characterized soils with first quartile water tables from 15.1 to 60 cm from the surface. Chromas of 1-4 dominated all but the driest soils. Relatively bright high chroma horizons, with or without low chroma mottling (chromas less-than-or-equal-to 2), were most common in soils with first quartile water levels greater than 45 cm from the surface, yet they also occurred in some of the most frequently saturated soils. In most cases, low chroma mottles as well as the lower surface of high chroma horizons without mottling were found at or below the highest water level recorded during the study period. These results suggest that soil features are not absolute indicators of water table level in somewhat poorly drained and very poorly drained soils of the Lakewood catena. A dual parameter approach that considers both soil features and vegetation to determine water levels provides a more accurate estimate of hydrologic conditions in these soils. Estimates based on one parameter should not be discounted when that parameter clearly characterizes hydrologic regime.																			0038-075X	1538-9243				MAY	1994	157	5					312	317		10.1097/00010694-199405000-00005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/00010694-199405000-00005													WOS:A1994NM40400005
J	SMITH, RL; OREMLAND, RS				SMITH, RL; OREMLAND, RS			BIG SODA LAKE (NEVADA) .2. PELAGIC SULFATE REDUCTION	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The epilimnion of hypersaline, alkaline, meromictic Big Soda Lake contains an average 58 mmol sulfate liter-1 and 0.4 .mu.mol dissolved iron liter-1. The monimolimnion, which is permanently anoxic, has a sulfide concentration ranging seasonally from 4 to 7 mmol liter-1. Depth profiles of sulfate reduction in the monimolimnion, assayed with a 35S tracer technique and in situ incubations, demonstrated that sulfate reduction occurs within the water column of this extreme environment. The average rate of reduction in the monimolimnion was 3 .mu.mol sulfate liter-1 d-1 in May compared to 0.9 in October. These values are comparable to rates of sulfate reduction reported for anoxic waters of more moderate environments. Sulfate reduction also occurred in the anoxic zone of the mixolimnion, though at significantly lower rates (0.025-0.090 .mu.mol liter-1 d-1 at 25 m). Additions of FeS (1.0 mmol liter-1) doubled the endogenous rate of sulfate reduction in the monimolimnion, while MnS and kaolinite had no effect. These results suggest that sulfate reduction in Big Soda Lake is iron limited and controlled by seasonal variables other than temperature. Estimates of the organic carbon mineralized by sulfate reduction exceed measured fluxes of particulate organic carbon sinking from the mixolimnion. Thus, additional sources of electron donors (other than those derived from the sinking of pelagic autotrophs) may also fuel monimolimnetic sulfate reduction in the lake.

J	VARESCHI, E				VARESCHI, E			THE ECOLOGY OF LAKE NAKURU (KENYA) .3. ABIOTIC FACTORS AND PRIMARY PRODUCTION	OECOLOGIA												Abiotic factors, standing crop and photosynthetic production were studied in the equatorial alkaline-saline closed-basin Lake Nakuru (conductivity 10,000-160,000 .mu.S). Meteorological conditions and abiotic factors offer suppositions for a high primary productivity: mean solar radiation is 450-550 kerg cm-2 s-1, with little seasonal variation; regular winds circulate the lake every day; and nutrient concentrations are usually high (> 100 .mu.g P-PO4 1-1). O2 concentrations near sediments were < 1 gO2 m-3 for at least 6 h d-1 [day] in 1972/1973 resulting in a release of .apprx. 45 mg P-PO4 m-2 d-1. Attenuation coefficients vary from 3.6-16.5 according to algal densities and mean depth from 0-400 cm. Algal biomass was .apprx. 200 g m-3 (d.w. [dry weight]) in 1972-1973, due to a lasting Spirulina platensis bloom (98.5% of algal biomass). In 1974 algal biomass suddenly dropped to 50 g m-3 (d.w.). Spirulina and several consumer organisms almost vanished, but coccoid cyanobacteria, Anabaenopsis and diatoms increased. Several causes for this change in ecosystem structure are discussed. The use of the light/dark bottle method to measure photosynthetic production in eutrophic alkaline lakes is discussed and relevant experiments were done. O2 tensions of 2-35 gO2 m-3 do not influence primary production rates. Net photosynthetic rates (mgO2 m-3 h-1; photosynthetic quotient = 1.18) reached 12-17.7 in 1972/1973 and 2-3 in 1974, but vertically integrated rates were only 1-1.4 in 1972/1973 and 0.8 in 1974, and daily net photosynthetic rates (gO2 m-3 h-1) 3.5 in 1972/1973 and 1 in 1974. Of areal rates, 50% were produced within the 10 most productive cm of the depth profile. The disproportion between high algal standing crops and relatively low production rates is due to self-shading of the algae, reducing the euphotic zone-35 cm in 1972/1973 and 77 cm in 1974. Efficiency of light utilization is 0.4-2%, varying with time of day and phytoplankton density. In situ efficiencies show an inverse relationship to light intensities. Photosynthetic rates of Lake Nakuru remain within the range of other African lakes (0.1-3 gO2 m-2 h-1). The relation of O2 produced/chlorophyll a of the euphotic zone is 50% lower than in tropical African freshwater lakes and conforms to lakes of temperate regions.																			0029-8549	1432-1939					1982	55	1					81	101		10.1007/BF00386722	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00386722								28309906					WOS:A1982PJ37200013

The annual discharge is 9730x10(8) m(3), but in addition many distributaries flow from the hilly catchment of the Qiantangjiang River in the south. and lake-canal networks in the north. The favorable conditions of the natural environment have facilitated development of the delta into one of Chinas superior economic zones. The delta occupies 1% of China's land area. accounts for 6.05% of the total population, and GDP accounts for a significant 21.4%. of the national total (2001). However the shortage of quality freshwater has become a major problem in the delta area, and water environmental quality has deteriorated, the worst affected areas being the canal and distributary network. The average water quantity per capita for this area equates to a third of the national average. Such discrepancies result from the severely unbalanced relationship between the population (800 per/km(2)) and environmental capacity. In addition, coastal water quality is also deteriorating, with frequent occurrence of red tides. As a consequence of ongoing land subsidence, the coasts and deltaic lowland suffer from flood inundation and serious waterlogging. The environmental stress presents a challenge for water resources management. This issue may be advanced by (i) analyses of the hydrologic characteristics, nature, seasonal and annual trends of the river; (ii) determination of load capacity of the available water resources; (iii) remediation of the existing water environment; and (iv) implementation of preventative treasures against. natural disasters such as flooding. water pollution, human induced waterlogging, and red tides. These measures need to be implemented in conjunction with an integrated water resources environmental management system, involving information dissemination to the public and public education.																			0749-0208	1551-5036				SUM	2004					43		75	88																WOS:000225529100009
J	SHIVIK, JA; CRABTREE, RL				SHIVIK, JA; CRABTREE, RL			COYOTE ACTIVITY LEVELS IN RELATION TO PRESENCE OF CALIFORNIA GULLS AT MONO-LAKE, CALIFORNIA	CALIFORNIA FISH AND GAME												Islands which have historically supported breeding colonies of California gulls (Larus californicus) at Mono Lake, California have recently become peninsularized, allowing access to them by coyotes (Canis latrans). Coyote ecology is important in Mono Lake Basin because invading coyotes may cause gulls to abandon breeding colonies. We monitored coyote activities by using movement-sensitive radio collars and hypothesized that coyotes would shift their activity rates in response to presence or absence of California gull prey. Coyotes did change their activity rates between seasons, but they did not adjust their activity levels to take advantage of nesting gulls' nighttime vulnerability. We also analyzed the activity data to look for relationships between tight lever and activity and between temperature and activity. Our results suggest that prey abundance and light level may not be as important in influencing coyote activity levels as temperature.																			0008-1078					WIN	1995	81	1					22	28																WOS:A1995RY69500004

In surface waters, where salinity was low and pH high, the saturation index increased to values near 20, whereas in bottom water, with high salinity and low pH, they were usually lower. The ionic product for H3PO4 was strongly correlated with the ionic product of Ca(OH)2 in surface and bottom waters, and with the ionic product of CaCO3 in bottom, which suggested that chemical composition was mainly controlled by a calcium-phosphate solid phase. The low concentrations of phosphate in surface were due to chemical precipitation and organic sedimentation, whereas in bottom, calcium phosphate redissolved and organic matter was mineralized producing high concentrations of soluble phosphate (> 60-mu-mol l-1). Decrease of calcium-bound phosphate in the upper layers of sediment was in agreement with a diminution of calcium-phosphate precipitation, probably due to a lower influence of seawater in the past.

From each sample and each species a length-weight relationship (LWR) was calculated resulting in 54 (65) regression equations based on n = 2466 (3032) in D. galeata (D. hyalina). The constant (Ln(A)) and (B) of the LWR showed a marked seasonal variability, ranging from Ln(A) = 1.0784 - 2.4740 (1.10152 - 2.3860) and B = 2.14 - 4.20 (2.11-4.15). The seasonal variability of the LWR was estimated with 4 different models. Condensing the 54 (65) equations into 1 seasonal cycle resulted in a model with an explained variance of r2 = 0.873 (0.869). Three more models were established by cycling multiple regressions with lake stratification, average fecundity (E), and food concentrations as determining variates. Differences in LWR of the 2 Daphnia spp. were significant (P < 0.001). As the most useful approximation during the period of stratification, LWR are recommended for D. galeata: Ln(W) = (1.5674 + 0.0287*(E)) + Ln(L)*(3.3611 + 0.0111*(E))) as a generalized LWR for an epilemnetic daphnid, and for D. hyalina: Ln(W) = (1.5593 + 0.0613*(E)) + Ln(L)*(3.2709 + 0.0017*(E)) as LWR for a daphnid which migrates diurnally between epi- and hypolimnion. The explained variance of this model is r2 = 0.843 (0.826). The influence of food concentration in the epilimnion on LWR was significant on Ln(A) but not on (B).																			0142-7873	1464-3774					1985	7	1					1	18		10.1093/plankt/7.1.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/7.1.1													WOS:A1985ABE4900001

Comparing androgens and androgen receptor expression in Cobitis taenia Linnaeus, 1958 males and females	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY					15th European Congress of Ichthyology	SEP 07-11, 2015	Porto, PORTUGAL	Interdisciplinary Ctr Marine & Environm Res				It is assumed that males and females of spined loach, Cobitis taenia are characterized by different androgen receptor patterns of expression in some of the target tissues and by different concentrations of androgens during their reproductive season. Moreover, still little is examined as to whether tissue sensitivity to androgens follows the changes in androgen concentrations across the fish reproductive cycle. This was verified by determining androgen (testosterone and 11-ketotestosterone) concentrations in whole fish bodies using ELISA and analyzing AR gene expression in androgen target tissues (gonads, muscles and liver) using RT-PCR. The partial sequence of the AR gene in C.taenia was also identified. The study was conducted on the spined loach, Cobitis taenia - a multiple spawning species in decline, having hybridized with closely-related taxa to form allopolyploids. Males (18 individuals) and females (18) were collected from an exclusively diploid population (Legiskie Lake, Baltic Sea basin) in 2013 during pre-spawning (May), spawning (June) and post-spawning (August) seasons (six fish per sampling period per sex) using a fry trawl (with a 0.2cm mesh). The reproductive status of the fish was verified by GSI and gonad histology. The results revealed seasonal variations in the concentration of androgens in C.taenia males and females as well as the dynamic, seasonal nature of AR gene expression in a tissue- and sex-dependent manner. Furthermore, a different seasonal profile of both androgens accompanied by a different pattern of AR expression in various tissues indicated complex physiological mechanisms engaged in AR regulation. These findings appear to be a good physiological basis for further studies using more advanced molecular techniques.					; Boroń, Alicja/AAQ-1463-2020	Boron, Alicja/0000-0003-3888-617X; Jablonska, Olga/0000-0002-8160-517X; Juchno, Dorota/0000-0002-7663-649X; Leska, Anna/0000-0002-3560-5363													0175-8659	1439-0426				APR	2017	33	2					209	216		10.1111/jai.13295	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jai.13295													WOS:000397476300008

In this work, a rapid stability assessment was created to evaluate the stability of the shoreline of Alpine Lake in West Virginia, USA. First, the assessment tool was created considering the metrics of bank height, bank angle, erosion, armoring, wind and wave action, unconsolidated materials, protection measures, vegetation, and accretion. The resulting tool was applied to 83 reaches (20-100 m in length) of the lake shoreline. The reaches were rated in terms of potential instability: very low (14%), low (42%), moderate (33%), high (10%), and very high (1%). Second, erosion rates were monitored at eight locations using erosion pins. Average erosion rates up to 0.22 mm/d were observed. Measured erosion rates generally supported the rapid assessment results, but there were some exceptions. Additional categories that consider human activity along the lakeshore for recreation should be added. If used without continued erosion monitoring, the rapid assessment should be completed multiple times because the stability of the banks with little vegetation buffer varied by season. Lastly, reclamation strategies are discussed.

The bedrock surface below the lake is distinctly V-shaped and contains a narrow, axial thalweg eroded as much as 279 m below lake level. Although a significant portion of the sediment fill is acoustically impenetrable (possibly due to gas-saturated sediment), four seismic stratigraphic sequences have been identified. The oldest (I) is restricted to the steeply sloping bedrock walls of the basin and correlates with lateral moraine ridges on the margins of the lake that record retreat of the late Wisconsin valley glacier. Younger sequences (collectively up to 150 m thick) occur along the axial portion of the basin and distinctly onlap sequence I and/or bedrock. Sequences II and III are characterized by alternations of highly reflective and reflection-free seismic facies whereas sequence IV consists exclusively of high-frequency parallel reflections. Sequences II and III are interpreted as fine-grained, proglacial lake sediments deposited from a glacier-fed river during final ice retreat from the basin. Sequence IV likely records a strongly seasonal postglacial sedimentation regime. Lake McDonald differs from other seismically investigated glaciated lake basins by its paucity of chaotic debris and a relatively simple infill stratigraphy. The nature of the bedrock surface and proglacial sediment fill may record the erosional and depositional significance of subglacial and proglacial meltwater activity. The thick stratigraphy beneath Lake McDonald likely contains a detailed record of glacial and environmental change for this portion of the Rocky Mountains.																			0004-0851					AUG	1991	23	3					311	319		10.2307/1551609	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1551609													WOS:A1991GD35100009

Application of temperature gradient gel electrophoresis technique to monitor changes in the structure of the eukaryotic leaf-epiphytic community of Posidonia oceanica	MARINE BIOLOGY												Seagrass leaves have been recognized as a suitable substratum in shallow sedimentary environments for the establishment of epiphytic communities. Microscope-based identification of species has been traditionally used to monitor changes in the composition of the eukaryotic leaf-epiphytic community of the seagrass Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile. Our main goal was to adapt the temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) barcoding technique largely used in molecular microbial ecology studies to monitor changes in the composition of P. oceanica epiphytic community. This molecular technique has been successful for handling large amounts of samples in a fast and reproducible manner. To that end, we applied the TGGE technique to study the epiphytic community in two different seasons and compare the results with those provided by the classical microscope approach. The results obtained with both approaches were generally consistent. The complexity of the banding pattern produced by TGGE was mirrored by the taxa richness of the community described using the classical approach. The minimum number of P. oceanica shoots necessary to adequately represent the composition of the eukaryotic leaf-epiphytic community was of the same order of magnitude for both techniques. Partial gene sequences of some selected bands affiliated with sequences of zoo and phytoephytic taxa. Some of them were detected using microscopy. Our results showed that TGGE is an excellent approach for comparative macrobenthic community studies that need parallel treatment of many samples at a time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time in which molecular barcoding techniques have been applied to the comparison of eukaryotic epiphytic communities.

The larval distribution showed a singificant increase in density at 22 hours regardless of season or habitat, which suggests a diel vertical migration pattern. The thermal stratification of the lake (mean differential of 0.5-degrees-C between the surface and 2 m and 0.6-degrees-C between 2 m and 4 m) suggests that this phenomena could be only partly related to a metabolic efficiency resulting from prawns residing at cooler depths during the day. In shallow tropical waters, predation by visually dependent planktivores can be a more important factor in the adaptative significance of the diel distribution of the macrozooplankton than a low thermal stratification. The diurnal feeding activity found in the predominant planktivores fish species of the Careiro lake reinforces this hypothesis.																			0065-6755						1993	12	3-4					385	398																WOS:A1993NT90500003

Nucleopore filters were used for determining egg output. Snail sampling was by the man-time method. A new system of recording human water contact was introduced for the peculiar condition at Agbenoxoe. Results indicated significant focality of infection and transmission in the compact village, concentration in the 5- to 19-year-old age group, and distinct seasonality of transmission. Water contact was frequent but of short duration. Only a few children under the age of 5 entered the water, and age-specific curves for duration of water contact paralleled the curve for geometric mean of egg counts (log10 of eggs + 1) for males and the prevalence curve for females. Water contact for males was of longer duration than for females and included more time playing and wading. These activities probably accounted for the much higher incidence and prevalence rates recorded for males over females in the village. The concentration of infection, transmission, and water contact in the 5- to 19-year-old age groups at Agbenoxoe and villages like it supports a control strategy of treating only this age span with drugs.																			0022-5304					OCT	1987	90	5					265	281											3118054					WOS:A1987K652100009

Long term AVHRR observations of surface radiative flux from El Chichon crater lake (1996-2006)	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												It has been shown that due to the small surface of crater lakes, temperature surveillance is a problem using meteorological satellites. This is particularly true for El Chichon surface lake because it's about one tenth of an AVHRR pixel at nadir. In order to guarantee at least one unmixed pixel in AVHRR data, it is necessary to use only AVHRR data from NOAA satellite passes as close as possible to the nadir for the period 1996-2006, therefore AVHRR data of El Chichon's crater lake were only used it they were cloudless and had scan angles close to nadir. The analysis of the time series data shows that lake surface temperature had annual maximum values (> 35 degrees C) during 1996 and 1997 then surface temperature decay with a negative exponential trend reaching a steady state of about 30 degrees C in the last years (2004-2006). A seasonal temperature variation between the dry (December to May) and the wet (June to November) seasons is also observed. Differences between nocturnal and midday temperatures indicate the influence of lake energy emission (including reflectance) at midday under a strong short-wave solar radiation. Water surface radiative flux under these conditions reaches an average of 77.8 W m(-2) and a maximum of 187.1 W m(-2). Whereas nocturnal heat output from El Chichon crater lake has an average surface radiative flux of 20.4 W m(-2) and a maximum of 74.3 W m(-2). The results show that radiant flux AVHRR data can still be considered a useful tool for detecting thermal changes in small crater lakes over time that would warrant a real-time warning monitoring system.

J	Hakoyama, H; Matsubara, N; Iguchi, K				Hakoyama, H; Matsubara, N; Iguchi, K			Female-biased operational sex ratio of sexual host fish in a gynogenetic complex of Carassius auratus	POPULATION ECOLOGY												To study the coexistence of sexual and gynogenetic forms, we examined the population structure of a gynogenetic complex of the Japanese crucian carp, Carassius auratus Temminck et Schlegel, during the April-June reproductive season by collecting 1225 mature fish that migrated from Lake Suwa to a tributary river for spawning. There were more sexual fish (about 80%) than gynogenetic fish in this complex, and the operational sex ratio in the sexual form was female biased (males were about 20%). Mean standard length and body weight of sexual females were larger than those of sexual males. Sex ratio was male biased in smaller fish (standard length, <8.5 cm) but female biased in larger fish (standard length, greater than or equal to8.5cm). We determined age by scale ring marks; the average age of sexual females was higher than that of males, but there was no significant difference in the average age between sexual and gynogenetic females. Sex ratio in the sexual form was more female biased for old than for young fish, and the mean size of sexual females was larger than that of males of the same age. The clear female-biased sex ratio and age difference between sexual females and males can be explained either by (1) higher mortality of males or by (2) female-biased sex allocation.

The minerology and isotope geochemistry of the alternating carbonates and diatomites indicate variable depositional conditions associated with an overall deepening of a lake. Anhedral dolomite associated with sulfate minerals characterizes the first depositional stage and has heavy oxygen- and light carbon-isotopic values which are consistent with a formation in a restricted environment with highly evaporated waters. Increasing dilution of the water is reflected in the presence of abundant aragonite near the base of the assemblage which passes to calcite near the top. The gradual upward decrease of both .delta.18O and .delta.13C in these minerals indicates a parallel decrease of the evaporation/inflow ratio within the depositional basin. Also, seasonal variations of composition and volume of the water affect both the formation and diagenesis of carbonate minerals.

The evaluation of Isoetes populations requires measurements of the lake data Secchi depth, water colour, PH and conductivity. the establishment of climate data and leaf counts on 20-30 plants with the aid of SCUBA. The method may be applied to lakes in a range of situations, varying between lowland and highland, and between temperate and subarctic climate regions. The regressions are displayed graphically. The actual mean leaf number and corresponding megaspore number are compared with the numbers referred to in the environmental data. Consistent values point to the parameters which influence growth and vitality of the quillwort and to what extent, in a particular lake.

J	CATTANEO, A				CATTANEO, A			THE ANTHROPOGENICALLY STRESSED PERIPHYTON OF LAKE ORTA, ITALY	HYDROBIOLOGIA												A long history of discharge of industrial wastes has left Lake Orta contaminated with high concentrations of acid, ammonia and copper. To study the effect of this chronic pollution on periphyton, I sampled epilithic algae and associated invertebrates at several sites from 1987 to 1988. Although biomass varied both spatially and seasonally, the taxonomic composition of these communities remained relatively stable. The dominant algae were chlorophytes and the dominant invertebrates were trichopterans. Comparisons with nearby unpolluted Lake Mergozzo, and with general equations developed for neutral lakes in North America indicate that these anthropogenic stresses are more clearly reflected by changes in the taxonomic composition and size distribution of the community than by changes in its biomass.																			0018-8158					MAY 29	1992	234	2					111	121		10.1007/BF00010866	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00010866													WOS:A1992JE14600005

Precipitation regimes during cold-season central US inverted trough cases. Part II: A comparative case study	WEATHER AND FORECASTING												This is the second of two papers that examine the organization of the precipitation field during central U.S. cold-season cyclones involving inverted troughs (ITs). The first paper (Part 1) used a climatology and composites to find synoptic-scale differences between storms with precipitation located ahead of the IT (ahead cases) and those with precipitation located behind the IT (behind cases). This paper expands the conclusions in Part I through the use of a comparative case study between two cyclones. The first cyclone, on 29 October 1996. was an ahead case that produced heavy rainfall and was associated with a potential vorticity (PV) anomaly moving across the central plains. The IT formed in the Ice of the Rockies prior to 0600 UTC 29 October and moved east into the northern plains over the next IS h. The trough itself was coincident with the limiting streamline, which separated moist air rising over the warm front from dry air subsiding behind the cyclone. The second cyclone. on 17-18 January 1996, had precipitation on both sides of the IT and was associated with heavy snow and blizzard conditions in the northern plains and significant ice accumulation in the western Great Lakes. The IT was associated with large frontogenesis over the snow area. The ascent was further enhanced by a jet streak moving across southern Canada. Dynamically, the IT resembled a warm front, with veering winds with height and a strong frontal inversion. The mechanism that appeared to control the different precipitation organization between the two systems was the orientation of the PV anomalies and the airstreams associated with their secondary circulations. This resulted in a differing orientation of the baroclinicity north and cast of the cyclone. In the ahead case, the rising branches of the secondary circulations forced by the northern and southern anomalies remained separate. This allowed the baroclinicity to develop along the traditional warm front, while the IT never developed a thermal gradient as it moved east. In the both sides case, the southern stream anomaly helped to fix the northern anomaly-forced jet streak in place, so that a strong temperature gradient developed along the IT with strong frontogenesis and warm-air advection observed behind the IT. As the frontal Circulation developed, the direct circulation associated with the right entrance region of a jet streak enhanced the ascent to the west of the IT. A conceptual model is proposed based upon the case Studies and the results of Part I. This model can be used by forecasters to differentiate between the precipitation regimes in cyclones associated with ITs.																			0882-8156					AUG	2008	23	4					617	643		10.1175/2007WAF2006058.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/2007WAF2006058.1													WOS:000258573300005

Chlamydomonas was much more sensitive to copper than was Ceriodaphia. The only correlation between copper toxicity and water chemistry was a positive correlation between DOC concentrations and algal density after a 72-h exposure to copper. Because freshwater DOC changes qualitatively as well as quantitatively over time, it is postulated that these qualitative changes result in unpredictable differences in copper-binding affinity of the DOC which makes it impossible to use DOC concentrations to predict environmentally safe concentrations of copper.																			0166-445X					DEC	1991	21	3-4					157	170		10.1016/0166-445X(91)90070-P	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0166-445X(91)90070-P													WOS:A1991HE06100003

The lake functions as a reservoir for the surrounding rice cultivation. From 1940's to 1988, its phytoplankton assemblage has been altered from a mesotrophic to a hypertrophic character, as consequence of the increasing pollution. For 1980-88, annual variations in the phytoplankton were less pronounced than seasonal changes. The hypertrophic and morphometric features of the lake favoured the stability of the phytoplankton assemblage and chlorophyll a levels during the study period. Seasonal and horizontal distribution of the total phytoplankton abundance and biomass were highly influenced by the hydrological cycle of the lagoon. Compared with other shallow nutrient rich lakes, the Albufera of Valencia is similar to the shallow hypertrophic lakes of the Netherlands.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB 25	1994	275						153	164		10.1007/BF00026707	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00026707													WOS:A1994NB19800014
J	BELL, CM; SUAREZ, M				BELL, CM; SUAREZ, M			THE DEPOSITIONAL-ENVIRONMENTS AND TECTONIC DEVELOPMENT OF A MESOZOIC INTRAARC BASIN, ATACAMA REGION, CHILE	GEOLOGICAL MAGAZINE												A thick succession of continental redbeds was deposited in a 50 km wide intra-arc basin on the Andean active continental margin in the Atacama region of northern Chile during early Cretaceous times. Upper Jurassic to early Cretaceous marine limestones were buried by the seaward progradation of a succession of coastal dunes, saline lakes and sandflats. Aeolian dune fields migrating towards the east across these coastal plains became stabilized by the growth of vegetation. Interdune alluvial areas between the sand dunes and dune fields developed into extensive alluvial braid plains which were in turn superimposed by alluvial fans. These fans were inundated by a regionally extensive saline lake produced by tectonic or volcanic damming of the sedimentary basin. This lake dried up leaving a large area of playa-lake mudflats. The climate was warm and semi-arid with a low and seasonal rainfall. Parts of the area supported a substantial vegetation of woody plants, together with a vertebrate fauna of dinosaurs, pterosaurs and crocodiles. The continental redbeds were derived from a volcanic source and were deposited on continental crust in a deep but narrow, north-south elongated, fault-bounded graben. This extensional basin formed in an intra-arc setting within an active andesitic volcanic chain. Upwards-coarsening sedimentary successions were the product of uplift of the fault-bounded margins of the basin.																			0016-7568					JUL	1993	130	4					417	430		10.1017/S0016756800020501	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0016756800020501													WOS:A1993LR34000001

The density-size distributions of the river zooplankton community were similar to those of lake plankton communities, in terms of a marked temporal variation in shape and overall bimodal shape. They differed in terms of the truncation of the upper body size and the absence of a significant relationship between the slope (regression coefficient) of a log-linear density-size model and environmental variables. The river zooplankton community appeared to have a high average rate of biomass increase when measured against body-mass class and a low mass-specific grazing rate, compared with those of lake communities. Because of methodological differences between studies, intersystem comparisons of size spectra and grazing rates need cautious interpretations and generalizations.

J	Tsiros, LX; Ambrose, RB				Tsiros, LX; Ambrose, RB			Environmental screening modeling of mercury in the upper everglades of South Florida	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND HEALTH PART A-TOXIC/HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES & ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												This screening modeling analysis examines mercury sources and fate in the upper canals of the South Florida Everglades. Mass balance modeling techniques are applied along with available data to examine the relative importance of external sources and internal cycling of mercury and the relative influence of several transport and transformation processes. WASP5, a general dynamic mass balance model for aquatic systems, was modified to represent elemental mercury, divalent mercury, and methyl mercury. A new soil mercury mass balance model was developed to track the transport of these mercury components from soil surfaces to the water via surface runoff. Subsurface now (drainage) loads were estimated on a seasonal basis using information from a modified simulation model for muck soil hydraulics and transport. Predicted mercury concentrations in the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA) canals were compared to observed data provided by a region-wide statistical sampling program. The modeling system reproduced the average mercury dynamics observed in the EAA canals during four surveys within a 2-year period. Results indicate that despite the complexity of the upper South Florida Everglades ecosystem, the modeling system provides a plausible description of the average mercury dynamics in the EAA canals. Mercury concentrations in the canals appear to be dominated by runoff loading events from the EAA during the wet season, and by subsurface flow (drainage) loading between events and during the dry season. Predicted mercury concentrations in water leaving the EAA are similar to or slightly less than average concentrations in downstream marsh environments for most of the year. Predicted concentrations following large rainfall events, however, are significantly higher than concentrations in the downstream marsh. These results must be considered as tentative due to the screening-level character of the modeling study. They point to more detailed field monitoring and process studies which could confirm these findings.																			1093-4529						1998	33	4					497	525		10.1080/10934529809376746	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934529809376746													WOS:000073608400001

Subjected to strong annual waterlevel fluctuations, the Orinoco River acts as a dam to the Mapire River discharge, resulting in the formation of a standing lake-like waterbody that covers the gallery forest to the canopy for five to six months. The Mapire floodplain fills primarily with Mapire waters and only secondarily with Orinoco water. The latter enters into the Mapire basin, but mixing of both waters is poor, resulting in chemically and physically different waterlayers. A significant thermal stratification is observed. This transient lake reverts to flowing conditions during the dry season. The Mapire River mouth, therefore, behaves as a cyclic system in which lotic/lentic and terrestrial/aquatic conditions alternate seasonally. Some ecological implications are suggested and comparisons with similar systems are made.

HUMAN INFECTIONS NEAR DAM SITES AND THE DISTRIBUTION AND HABITAT PREFERENCES OF POTENTIAL SNAIL INTERMEDIATE HOSTS	ANNALS OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PARASITOLOGY												Stool and urine samples from 813 schoolchildren and adults from the Tomas and Rimin Gado dam areas of Kano State, Nigeria, showed Schistosoma haematobium to be present at both localities with prevalences of 26.6 and 36.8%, respectively. No cases of S. mansoni were found. The prevalence and intensity of S. haematobium was low and similar in both study areas. Statistical analysis revealed a correlation between prevalence and location, but no evident association with professed patterns of water contact. Investigation of 164 freshwater habitats throughout the state revealed the presence of a number of potential and snail intermediate host species, namely Bulinus senegalensis, B. forskalii, B. globosus, B. rohfsi and Biomphalaria pfeifferi. The most widespread species was Bulinus senegalensis, which inhabited shallow pools and excavations on a variety of substrata. Its habitats were typically devoid of aquatic vegetation and included those with highly turbid waters and conductivities as low as 11 .mu.s. Bulinus forskali was by contrast relatively rare, occurring in more permanent water courses, although it was often found in mixed populations with B. senegalensis. Bulinus globosus also occurred in seasonally rain-filled pools, but was confined to areas south of the 12.degree. N parallel, and its habitats tended to have a well-developed aquatic flora and clear water. The dominant species in man-made lakes was B. rohfsi, which occurred in both the Tomas and Rimini Gado reservoirs. Biomphalaria pfeifferi was also primarily lake dwelling, although all species save B. senegalensis were found in irrigation canals.																			0003-4983	1364-8594				DEC	1988	82	6					561	570		10.1080/00034983.1988.11812292	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00034983.1988.11812292								3256277					WOS:A1988R565900006
J	STEINKE, TD; WARD, CJ				STEINKE, TD; WARD, CJ			SOME EFFECTS OF THE CYCLONES DOMOINA AND IMBOA ON MANGROVE COMMUNITIES IN THE ST-LUCIA ESTUARY	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												The cyclones Domoina and Imboa struck the St Lucia area in Janurary/February 1984. Research in progress at the time made it possible to assess some of the effects of these cyclones on the mangrove communities of the St Lucia Estuary. Assessment has been based on aerial and ground observations, litter studies in an Avicennia marina (Forssk.) Vierh. and Bruguiera gymnorrhiza (L.) Lam. stand, mortality counts in the above B. gymnorrhiza stand and biomass determinations of algae epiphytic on A. marina pneumatophores. The heavy rainfall which accompanied the cyclones, and the subsequent flooding of the rivers, caused lake levels to rise and the floodwaters inflicted damage on mangrove stands. Destructuion of the A. marina stand in which litter collections were being made, terminated this study. However, continued recordings were possible in the B. gymnorrhiza stand which enabled an assessment of the effects of the cyclones on the production of leaf and stem litter and reproductive material to be made. Die-back of branches and trees resulted in a significant increase in leaf litter for up to 8 months following the cyclones. Propagules and flowering material were lost In the floodwaters, the loss of the latter material causing minimal propagule production in the fruiting season after the cyclones. Total counts of trees and saplings 1 m and over revealed that B. gymnorrhiza suffered the greatest mortality with 67.1% living and 32.9% dead, whereas A. marina had 83.8% living and 16.2% dead. However, of all woody plants in this stand B. gymnorrhiza comprised 92% and A. marina 5.5%. Low biomass values of epiphytic algae were recorded as a result of the floodwaters, but recovery was rapid and very high yields were recorded the following warm season. The species composition of this algal community was not altered by the events. The immediate effects of the cyclones comprised damage to the standing crop by the direct impact of the floodwaters and also a loss of plant litter. Long-term effects included a reduction in propagative material and stress, resulting in leaf loss and death, mainly of B. gymnorrhiza.																			0254-6299	1727-9321				JUN	1989	55	3					340	348		10.1016/S0254-6299(16)31186-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0254-6299(16)31186-3													WOS:A1989AD87600012
J	Jeon, JC; Kim, LH; Min, KS				Jeon, Je-Chan; Kim, Lee-Hyung; Min, Kyung-Sok			Determination on the optimum design factors of BMP for nonpoint pollutant treatment through long-term monitoring	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												Despite huge investments about point source pollution in South Korea over the past 30 years, there is no improvement in the restoration of water quality in rivers and lakes since the 1990s. The reason for this was because of the nonpoint source (NPS) pollution. Therefore, the Korean government prepared a variety of policies and systems to control NPS. The 1st comprehensive measures for NPS management were established to provide policies on the installations of test beds for NPS reduction facilities, determination of treatment efficiency through monitoring, and guidelines for planning and maintenance. The study provided a method for proper installation of the inlet screen and weir in the NPS reduction facility. In addition, the study has identified the optimal linear velocity and depth of media in a filtration facility. In the case of screens installed in closed channels, due to clogging caused by wastes, it was found out that installation of a 3-dimensional structure will be convenient for maintenance. Earth and sediment were not controlled when the weir was installed near the inlet of the facility. However, installation of the weir farther from the inlet of the facility had made improvement for the facility's removal efficiency and maintenance. Therefore, the weir should be installed 1-2 m away from the inlet of the facility to improve efficiency and to provide easier maintenance. Meanwhile, results show that a linear velocity of 25-30 m(3)/h in the filtration facility is most effective for the treatment of contaminants. Also, the facility is most efficient when replacement of media takes place once a year during March. On the other hand, the media does not function normally due to blockage by particulate matters after the rainy season. Therefore, there should be surface dredging of the media once a year after heavy rainfalls. It was also found out the optimal thickness of the media in the filtration facility is more than 0.7 m according to the Total suspended solids (TSS) and Total Phosphorus (TP) treatment efficiency analysis.

Annual geometric mean concentrations of chlorophyll a, total N and total P were used since no distinct growing season was discernable. Annual mean ratios of total N to total P in the near surface waters ranged between 10 and 59 (by weight). Strong correlations were obtained between log-transformed values of chlorophyll a and total N (r2 = 0.53, n = 16), chlorophyll a and total P (r2 = 0.71, n = 21), and between total N and total P (r2 = 0.69, n = 16). After correcting for the high interdependency between total N and total P, only total P was found to be important in predicting chlorophyll concentrations. Much of the variance in the chlorophyll-P relation was attributable to differences in mean lake depth. Lakes with mean depths less than 11 m had significantly more chlorophyll a per unit of total P (.hivin.x = 0.54 .mu.g .cntdot. .mu.g-1, SE = 0.05, n = 6) than lakes of greater mean depth (.hivin.x = 0.17 .mu.g .cntdot. .mu.g-1, SE = 0.02, n = 14). When the effect of mean depth was taken into account, 89% of the variance in chlorophyll a was explained compared with 71% for the simple linear regression on total P alone.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1985	121	2					181	189		10.1007/BF00008722	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008722													WOS:A1985ADD3300012

Algal assemblages were manipulated by filtration, dilution, or additions of nutritious algae, in order to determine causes for growth inhibition. There was no evidence for lethal toxic effects or food limitation of population growth rates during the algal bloom, although growth was food limited later in the year. However, growth rates were lower in the experiment conducted during the Cyanobacteria bloom than in later experiments, and the results suggest an inhibitory factor associated with the particulate material. Results from filtered treatments indicate that picoplankton present in hypereutrophic waters can support Daphnia growth and reproduction.

Whereas the locality of Thaytiniti occurs at the base of the transgressive marine Ashawq Formation (Shizar Member), the fossil level of Taqah is intercalated within a regressive clay-grit sequence which caps the deposits of the Shizar Member. Biostratigraphic evidence suggests an early Oligocene age for the two localities, although that of Taqah is probably younger than that of Thaytiniti. At Taqah, the sequence accumulated during a temporary regression of the sea and corresponds to a temporary installation of a marginal-littoral depositional environment, which was influenced by both marine and terrestrial factors. Only the locality of Taqah has, until now, been the subject of a detailed multidisciplinary study, based on the excavation and screening of 13 tons of sediment. The position of Taqah between the sea and the continent, explains the particular faunal and floral association that occurs there. This association is characterized by the juxtaposition of elements indicative of marine environments (subtidal to intertidal stages) (Melobesian algae, benthic foraminifera such as Discorbidae, Lituolidae, Elphidium and nummulites, corals, bivalves and gastropods, decapod crustaceans and cirripeds, echinoids and asterois, rays, sharks and sparidae), freshwater (charophytes, dipneustes, osteoglossiform and characiform fishes, podocnemidid turtles and small brevirostran crocodiles) and terrestrial (lignitic fibres, cuticles, mushrooms and mushroom spores, plant macrofossils, anurans, lacertilians, snakes, testudinine tortoises as well as numerous mammals). The presence in the fossiliferous level of irregularly laminated micrite fragments (caliche) with Microdium indicates a reworking from pedogenetic calcareous crusts. The organic matter which is scarce and weakly carbonised originates from primary algal production. Sedimentological criteria, and the presence of a largely derived marine microfaune indicates that this horizon accumulated in a shallow coastal swamp, sporadically, perhaps even rarely influenced by the sea (aeolian transport, tempests or high tides). From a palaeoclimatological aspect, the faunal assemblage indicates a hot climate. The formation of calcareous crusts, the presence of an erycine snake and of the embrithopod Arsinoitherium, suggest that the climate was semi-arid. Nevertheless several factors indicate that the climate was strongly seasonal with a marked rainy season; this is shown by the lack of evaporites, the presence of clastic sedimentary rocks and the presence in the northern Dhofar of broad permanent lakes with carbonate sedimentation.

The distribution of MW of DOC was relatively constant with depth and season, with a predominance of high MW (> 100,000 daltons; 31%) and moderate MW compounds (1000-10,000 daltons; 36%). The distribution of MW of DOC in the lake was distinctly different from that of the DOC which entered the lake in stream water, soil solution, or precipitation. Lake water is relatively enriched in DOC above 100,000 daltons; this high-MW DOC is apparently produced within the lake. One autochthonous source of DOC above 100,000 daltons is that produced during algal growth and decomposition. An input/output budget of the DOC for each MW class suggested that most of the DOC in the lake resides in the lake for several years.

In an initial survey during the rainy season in Aug. 1978, rotavirus was detected in 10 of 10 drinking water samples and coxsackievirus B4 or B6 in 5 of 10. In a larger survery during the dry season in Dec. 1979, rotavirus was recovered from 3 and enteric viruses from 8 of 21 drinking water samples. Water quality data, available for the 1979 survey, indicated that, while many tapwater samples did not meet USA coliform standards, some samples containing infectious virus did. Evidently, current bacteriological water quality standards for potable water do not reflect viral contamination.

Stability of allele and genotypic frequencies of six microsatellite DNA loci in the adjacent generations and spawning populations of the sockeye salmon of the Bol' shaya River was confirmed experimentally. The pairwise intersample differentiation (F-st) of the local sockeye salmon populations from the southwestern Kamchatka coast (Ozernaya and Bol' shaya Rivers) was almost 7 times higher than the corresponding values for the spawning populations of the Bol' shaya River sockeye salmon of the adjacent years; 15 times, for the adjacent Bol' shaya River sockeye salmon generations; and four times, for the seasonal races within the Kamchatka River.

We established the reliability of this mark for distinguishing age-0 hatchery fish from wild fish in Lake Pend Oreille, Idaho. Hatchery fish marked with dietary oxytetracycline (OTC) were recaptured 1-3 months after they had been stocked in the lake. All specimens with OTC marks on their bony structures also had a stress check. We also validated daily otolith increments for age-0 kokanees by comparing increment counts external to the stress check with known days between release and recapture of hatchery fish. Then, counts of daily increments allowed us to correctly identify fish from several co-occurring release groups that had been stocked at different times in the same season. Such discrimination will enhance evaluations of alternative stocking strategies. Because some otolith growth increment counts varied slightly from days at large, and because fish released in cold, food-poor, or otherwise unfavorable sites apparently did not resume otolith growth immediately, we recommend that groups of kokanee be released at least 7 d apart if they are to be subsequently identified by otolith analysis.																			0002-8487					NOV	1992	121	6					785	791		10.1577/1548-8659(1992)121<0785:UODGIO>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1992)121<0785:UODGIO>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1992KR62200010

Mesocyclops notius, a dominant crustacean Zooplankter throughout tropical Australia, was previously considered to be endemic to Australia, but recently, Mesocyclops leuckarti in Lake Donghu was re-identified as M. notius. Laboratory culture experiments were conducted to reveal the effect of temperature (15, 20, 25 and 30 degreesC) on the development, growth and reproduction of M. notius. Temperature was inversely related to development times of eggs, nauplii and copepodites, body length and physiological longevity of adults, and brood size. Body length and physiological longevity of females were greater than those of males at the same temperature. No reproduction took place at 15 degreesC. Production and seasonal cycles of M. notius during 1980-1982 were studied at two sampling stations of Lake Donghu. At the mid-lake station, the annual production and production/biomass (P/B) ratio of M. notius varied between 6.0 and 18.0 g dry wt m(-2) year(-1) and 74.6 and 95.5, respectively. Mesocyclops notius reached their highest density peaks in the warm months (July-October), with a maximum density of 1256 individuals l(-1) at a littoral site. No reproduction and recruitment by AL notius took place during the cold months (December March) when the temperature of the lake water was < 15 degreesC. Mesocyclops notius were more abundant at a littoral station than at a pelagic station, possibly due to different food availability. The higher male:female sex ratio of M. notius at the littoral station was most likely caused by size-selective fish predation on larger females.

Seasonality and spatial variation in abundance, biomass and activity of heterotrophic bacterioplankton was studied in a tropical freshwater lake. Variation in phytoplankton biomass and production, and several other limnological parameters, were also quantified. 2. Bacterial number and biomass fluctuated between 3.88-8.33 .times. 106 ml-1 and 68-125 mg C m-3, respectively. No spatial variation was observed in these bacterial variables, although other limnological parameters showed vertical variation. 3. Seasonal and vertical variation of heterotrophic bacterial activity were estimated from oxygen consumption, 14CO2 dark uptake and plate counts of colony forming units. All three methods showed vertical heterogeneity, with higher activity in the hypolimnion during the long stratification period (February-May). Oxygen consumption rate and plate counts showed seasonality. 4. In spite of the low seasonality of climate in the tropics, several biological, chemical and physical variables were correlated with changes in bacterial variables. Wind and rainfall, and their effects on stratification and mixing, vertical distribution of nutrients and rate of primary production appeared to be the important parameters affecting heterotrophic bacterioplankton.

The lake''s volume is 37 km3 and its annual outflow is 25 km3 yr-1, yielding a residence time of about 1.5 years. Water mass distributions are controlled by the interactions of three processes: riverine circulation, mixed-layer dynamics, and internal wave behavior. The riverine circulation is determined by the inflow rate and by the relative density of incoming water and ambient lake water. Mixed-layer structure varies in relation to the combined action of the wind and surface heat flux on both seasonal and synoptic time scales. Internal waves may periodically raise a given stratum of water; such as the riverine layer, to a depth where wind mixing is more intense. Knowledge of these processes, their relative importance, and their time-space variability can aid in understanding the ecology of the lake.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				MAR	1986	31	2					249	265		10.4319/lo.1986.31.2.0249	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1986.31.2.0249													WOS:A1986A838300002

Status and Breeding Ecology of the Common Coot Fulica atra in Tiffech Lake North-East Algeria	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY & DEVELOPMENT												An investigation was conducted on the breeding Fulica atra population in Tiffech Lake, situated in Northeast Algeria. Nest site selection and breeding parameters were studied for the first time in this freshwater Lake subject to anthropogenic influence, during the breeding season 2016. Most nests (80%) were located in dense stands of Common club-rush Scirpus lacustris, whereas a few were found on lower stands of Scirpus maritimus. Coot nests are characterized by an average internal diameter of 17.52 +/- 0.43 cm, an average external diameter of 33.42 +/- 0.3 cm and an average height of 22.12 +/- 0.43 cm. The average water depth in zones of Coot nesting is 64.45 +/- 8.35 cm. The nest dimensions were also correlated with water depth at nestling sites. On the natural ecosystem of Tiffech Lake, The breeding season extended from mid-February to late August. Mean clutch size was 6.1 +/- 0.2 (n = 54), and incubation period was 27 days. The mean length, breadth and volume measured of 248 eggs were 76.25 +/- 0.73 mm, 50.32 +/- 0.41 mm and 102.52 +/- 1.04 cm(3) respectively. Two aspects make this population distinct from most other Common coot populations studied to date. It is characterized by an earlier onset of egg-laying, and long egg-laying period. Nevertheless, the present study shows that the mean clutch size, egg volume and incubation period were comparable to those known for other Mediterranean populations.																			0972-9984	0973-7308					2017	32	4					119	129																WOS:000424144000011

Dairy production in North America will shift to areas with sufficient rainfall and adequate growing seasons, primarily migrating from the west and southwest to Great Lakes regions and into the Canadian prairies. Milk yield per cow will exceed 50,000 1b/year and the USA will have 4 to 5 million milk cows. Commercial cows will comprise genes from multiple breeds or from gene editing. New genetics will move into herds primarily through embryos that may carry proprietary genes. Dairy enterprises will share laterally-integrated business structures that include separate units for pre-weaned calves, replacement heifers, early-dry cows, transition cows, milk cows, dairy beef, and feed centers. Feed production will have a greater focus on agro-ecological systems and perennial crops, including perennial maize, sorghums, and energy-grasses that will replace annual row crops. Robotics, automation, and sensors will replace a majority of manual labor and will enhance reliability, consistency, and compliance with regulations. Major shifts in herd management will be driven through management of epigenetics and associated environmental regulation of gene expression, and management of microbiomes of cattle, soils, crops, and farmsteads. Knowledge systems will evaluate herds as independent superorganisms to understand why herds that have similar genetics and environments differ in performance.																									2017							11	21																WOS:000404097900001

The aquatic macrophytes that have been used as bioindicator species in this study are Phragmites australis, Ceratophyllum demersum and Lemna minor. The plants, water and sediments were tested for Cu content in six locations around Skadar Lake, Montenegro across four different periods of 2011. The content of Cu in the examined sediment was in the range of 23.9-54.4 mg kg(-1). The largest proportion of Cu (64%) was associated with its oxidizable phase in the form of organic complexes. The concentration of Cu in the studied macrophytes declined in the following order: L. minor > P. australis > C. demersum. The highest content of Cu was detected in the root of L. minor (31.0 mg kg (-1) dry weight) in October. During the research period, the concentration of Cu was constantly increasing in the leaves of P. australis and in the root and leaves L. minor, while other parts of the macrophytes recorded different trends. The highest correlation of Cu content with sediment was noted for P. australis.

Increased Walleye Egg-to-Larvae Survival following Spawning Habitat Enhancement in a Tributary of Eastern Lake Ontario	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												To mitigate the effects of sedimentation from surrounding land use, a Newbury weir was installed in Kent's Creek (a tributary of eastern Lake Ontario) by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program to enhance spawning habitat for Walleye Sander vitreus. By adding angular crushed limestone, the Newbury weir was designed as an engineered spawning riffle that creates a scouring effect to maintain clean spawning substrate for Walleyes. To evaluate the success of the Newbury weir, we compared rates of egg deposition, egg viability, and larval out-migration between the created spawning riffle and a natural spawning bed for two seasons subsequent to its construction. Spawning Walleyes were found to immediately spawn on the created riffle following construction and demonstrated similar patterns of egg deposition and larval out-migration at both sites each year. When data were pooled between years, significantly higher densities of out-migrating larvae were observed at the Newbury weir despite the finding that significantly more eggs were spawned at the natural site. Considering that egg viability was similar between sites, we deduce that the created riffle had a higher egg-to-larvae survival rate. Our results suggest that the Newbury weir successfully created functional spawning habitat promoting out-migrating larval Walleyes. We anticipate that the created riffle will maintain valuable spawning substrate for Walleyes, but sediments deposited from upstream eroding banks and agricultural land use practices could affect its long-term viability. We recommend that future spawning habitat enhancement projects adopt similar approaches within appropriate fluvial geomorphic settings and additionally consider watershed-scale improvements to enhance Walleye spawning tributaries.

Regime of snow cover in the Baikal region under the climate change	LED I SNEG-ICE AND SNOW												Spatial and temporal variability of dates of snow cover setting-up and loss (dates of the snow cover appearance and disappearance, and formation and destruction of stable snow cover) and duration of stable snow occurrence on a territory of the Baikal region were analyzed from data of observations made at meteorological stations in 1981-2010. Compared to the previous long-term period prior to 1980, mean monthly air temperatures rose in every month during the cold season. Significant changes in dates of the snow cover setting-up were observed only at individual stations, while the duration of the snow occurrence does not show such changes. Typical period of fluctuations for the last characteristic is the quasi-biennial, and more rare it is 3-4 years. In relation to the previous multi-year period, the largest variability of dates of the snow-cover setting-up as well as increase of number of dates and so duration of its occurrence (up to 19 days) take place on the South-Western coast of Lake Baikal (Bolshoe Goloustnoe). In plain and mountain regions of the Baikal region, variability of these dates does not exceed 10-15 days. Compared to the earlier period (before 1980), it was noticed that the snow appear earlier and disappear later (with the difference of about five days). In most cases, deviation of earlier dates of formation and destruction of stable snow cover is within 10 days. During 1981-2010, a number of days with snow cover increased in river valleys of the taiga belt in the Eastern Sayan (GMR Verchnyaya Gutara) by 11 days, while in the mountain Khamar-Daban (GMS Khamar-Daban) - by 15 days.

Biodiversity Indicators: Plankton and Macroinvertebrates in Lake Victoria, Selected Satellite Lakes and Rivers	LAKE VICTORIA FISHERIES RESOURCES: RESEARCH AND MANAGEMENT IN TANZANIA	Monographiae Biologicae											Plankton and macroinvertebrates are used as biodiversity indicators on account of their sensitivity to changes in aquatic ecosystems. This chapter assesses the changes in the diversity, abundance and distribution of plankton and macroinvertebrates in the inshore and offshore areas of Lake Victoria, selected satellite lakes and rivers within the lake basin. Samples for both plankton and macroinvertebrates were collected during dry and wet seasons between 2000 and 2006. The results indicated that cyanobacteria were most diverse in both seasons. Microcystis spp., Planktolyngbya spp. and Anabaena spp. were the most dominant cyanophyte species at the sampled sites. The dominant phytoplankton (cyanobacteria) are less digestible and provide poor quality food for the fish; that may have contributed to the reduction or loss of planktivorous haplochromines and tilapiines that once flourished in Lake Victoria. Zooplankton community composition in the lake is dominated by rotifers and cyclopoid copepods, in both inshore and offshore areas. The dominance of cyclopoid copepods is important in the production and sustainability of small fishes and larvae that utilize these organisms as a food base. Macroinvertebrate abundance has shifted from an oligochaete and insect dominated community in 1984 to a community dominated by molluscs. The occurrence of a relatively high abundance of low-oxygen tolerant macroinvertebrate taxa at inshore and offshore stations is an indication of deteriorating water quality water quality conditions due to eutrophication and pollution processes.

Bacteria endophytes, harmless symbiotic organisms that promote plant growth and development, have been considered useful tools for ecosystem restauration. Goals. The present study characterized bacteria endophytes isolated from Lemna gibba plants (collected in the "chinampera area" of Xochimilco canals over two seasons) according to the amount of indole acetic acid production. Methods. Twelve phytobacteria species were found; eight in plants collected through the drought season belonging to the genera Achromobacter, Bacillus, Deinococcus, Enterococcus, and four in plants collected during the rainy season of the genus Serratia. Results. According to their indole acetic acid production, four of the phytobacteria isolated from plants collected in the dry season were characterized as low producers and four as high producers. All the organisms obtained from plants gathered during the rainy season were classified as high producers. Conclusions. The presence of endophytic bacteria producing large amounts of indole acetic acid in Lemna gibba plants suggests that these organisms could promote plant development and act as potential bioinoculants.

Additionally, influence of the selected environmental characteristics on functioning of these insignificant water ecosystems was evaluated. Ten ponds varying in terms of catchment usage structure, hydrologic type and size of surface area were selected for the studies. Impact of the catchment management on water quality was evaluated. In addition, it was verified if periodic changes in the reservoir hydrological function (incorporation into the surface runoff system) significantly affected the water quality. The results confirmed that the usage structure of small reservoir catchment had a decisive influence on the quality of the water. The principal cause of the increasing concentrations of the analyzed ions (Li+, Na+, NH4+, Mg-2(+), K+, Ca-2(+), F-, Cl-, NO2-, Br-, NO3, PO43-, SO42-) was the neighborhood of farms. Seasonal changes in the nutrient (total nitrogen, total phosphorus) water concentrations were not observed. Significant changes in water quality by intermittently forming hydrographic network that interconnected the individual depressions were reported for total nitrogen only. Interestingly, the landlocked ponds, in theory continuously accumulating contaminants from the catchment area, were characterized by good hydro-chemical conditions.

Variation in the Chemical Status of Water and Soil Sediments along Saiwa Swamp Ecosystem, Trans Nzoia County, Kenya	ASIAN JOURNAL OF WATER ENVIRONMENT AND POLLUTION												Saiwa Swamp National Park in west-northern Kenya presents a typical wetland, and is habitat to the rare sitatunga antelope (Tragelaphus spekei). The swamp is surrounded by farms making it an ecological island, thus threatening the very existence of this wetland. Agrochemicals released from these farms are channelled into the swamp and thus affecting its physico-chemical status. This study compared the chemistry of water and soil sediments at specific sites along the swamp gradient during the rainy season. pH of surface waters was nearly neutral (mean of 7.0) during the entire study period while that of the soil sediments was acidic (4.6 to 5.0). Elements Ca, Mg and Fe recorded higher concentrations in dry season compared to the wet season. Other elements including Cu, Mn and Zn were not detected in surface water during the dry season. There was an increase in concentrations of Cu and Mn in the swamp waters during the wet season. The findings of the study showed a large percentage of the nutrients removed from the subsurface water in filtering contaminants.																			0972-9860	1875-8568					2017	14	3					19	26		10.3233/AJW-170022	http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/AJW-170022													WOS:000405333600004

Factors Influencing Nest Survival in Florida Bass	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Angling nesting Florida Bass Micropterus salmoides floridanus may influence the survival of the brood and could negatively affect bass populations. Our objectives were to estimate daily nest survival for Florida Bass and to examine factors that influence nest survival to the swim-up fry stage. Snorkelers examined a total of 259 nests in a small, mesotrophic lake in north-central Florida from 2010 to 2012. We compared nest survival rates with accumulated degree-days, largest temperature drop following nest discovery, nest score, presence of a guarding male bass, and size of the guarding male. The most important factor in determining nest survival was the presence of a male bass. However, guarding male fish were only observed on 66% of active nests despite multiple visits to each nest, indicating a lower tendency to remain with the brood than has been reported in other Micropterus species. Florida Bass have displayed lower nest guarding behaviors in other studies; a prolonged spawning season and the presence of top predators in southern bass populations may influence decreased nest fidelity and nest guarding behavior. Individual nesting attempts may be less important for successful Florida Bass recruitment.

J	Takasu, H; Nakano, S				Takasu, Hiroyuki; Nakano, Shin-ichi			Growth and mortality rates of prokaryotes in the hypolimnion of a deep freshwater lake (Lake Biwa, Japan)	INLAND WATERS												The presence of pico-sized cyanobacteria (genus Synechococcus) in hypolimnetic waters has been reported, and investigators have suggested that Synechococcus contribute more to ecological processes in the hypolimnion than previously hypothesized; however, the ecological role of Synechococcus in food webs and/or matter cycling in the hypolimnion remains unknown. To address this issue, we assessed protistan grazing and the virus-mediated mortality of Synechococcus in the oxygenated hypolimnion of a large freshwater lake (Lake Biwa, Japan) during the stratification period. In addition, we compared the carbon flux through mortality of Synechococcus to that of heterotrophic bacteria to evaluate the role of Synechococcus in ecological processes within a hypolimnetic ecosystem. Our results suggest that the biomass of Synechococcus and heterotrophic bacteria in the hypolimnion was removed primarily by protistan grazing. The abundance of Synechococcus was highest in August, when the average Synechococcus: bacteria carbon biomass and daily grazing loss ratios were 10.8% and 11.0%, respectively. Thus, the Synechococcus biomass is likely an important seasonal component of the carbon flux in the hypolimnetic microbial loop. Our results provide the first data on carbon flux through the mortality of both Synechococcus and bacteria in a hypolimnetic ecosystem.

Epiphytic bacteria make an important contribution to heterotrophic bacterial production in a humic boreal lake	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Bacterial production (BP) in lakes has generally only been measured in the pelagic zone without accounting for littoral BP, and studies of BP at the whole-lake scale are very scarce. In the dystrophic humic lakes, which are common throughout the boreal region, low light penetration through water has been assumed to seriously limit available habitats for littoral organisms. However, many highly humic boreal lakes have extensive partly submerged vegetation around the lake perimeter which can provide well-lit substrata for highly productive epiphyton. We measured epiphytic BP on the littoral vegetation and pelagic BP in a small highly humic boreal lake in Finland during an open-water season and extrapolated the BP rates to the whole lake. Pelagic BP dominated the combined BP over the study period, but the epiphytic BP contributed an average of 24% to overall BP over the sampling period and was almost equal to pelagic BP in July. According to these results, a substantial component of BP has been previously overlooked in the lake when BP has been measured only from the pelagic. Our study demonstrates that the role of the littoral zone in BP in highly humic lakes has previously been understated, and needs to be taken into account in assessments of whole-lake carbon cycling and metabolism.

J	Yamaguchi, T; Noguchi, I				Yamaguchi, Takashi; Noguchi, Izumi			Variations in Ambient Nitrogen Concentrations between an Inland Area of Tree Decline and a Coastal Area in Northern Japan	BALTIC FORESTRY												Tree decline has recently been reported around the somma of Lake Mashu, Hokkaido, northeastern Japan, although its cause is uncertain. We have evaluated the concentrations of ambient reactive nitrogen compounds such as gaseous ammonia (NH3), ammonium particles (NH4+), and nitrate particles (NO3-) both at Lake Mashu, located inland, and at Ochiishi, located on the Japanese coast. These gas and particles were measured at both sites by a multiple filter-pack method. The concentrations of NH3 and NH4+ were greater during the warm season-from May to Sep.-at Lake Mashu (40.8 nmol m(-3) and 25.3 nmol m(-3), respectively) than at Ochiishi, (20.1 nmol m(-3) and 16.6 nmol m(-3), respectively), whereas the concentration of NO3- at Lake Mashu (1.0 nmol m(-3)) Was lower than at Ochiishi (7.7 nmol m(-3)). The emission of NH3 and NH4+ via agricultural activity in the area is thought to have contributed to their ambient concentrations at Lake Mashu; however, NO3- particles are thought to have been removed by gravitational settling during transport. Compared to other areas in Japan and Asia, the concentrations measured in this study were relatively low; however, the amount of nitrogen deposited in mountainous areas was heterogeneous and incorporated a contribution from fog. Further comprehensive investigation is thus required in order to gain a complete understanding of the influence that nitrogen compounds have on various ecological systems.																			1392-1355						2017	23	2					402	410																WOS:000405145000008

Despite the similar trophic level of these lakes, protein to carbohydrate ratios were generally above 1 in Lake Ontario, indicating lack of severe phosphorus or nitrogen deficiency, while those of Jacks Lake were always well below 1, indicating severe nutrient stress. However, in Lake Ontario, some discrepancies with other indicators of nutrient status occurred which complicate interpretations of the ratio. The ratio will also not distinguish phosphorus from nitrogen deficiency. On average, 28% (11-80%) of the particulate organic carbon is carbohydrate carbon and 80% (40-100%) of the particulate organic nitrogen is protein-nitrogen in Lake Ontario. Chlorophyll a explained 44% of the variation in carbohydrate but only 22% of the variation in protein.

Facilitating food crop production in Lungwena, Mangochi District in Malawi: Lessons from a farmer-based pass-on seed support model	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH												Lungwena extension planning area is a coastal community on the south end of Lake Malawi. Due to a unimodal rainfall pattern, food shortages are common for two to five months before the next harvest. In order improve food production, a farmer-based seed multiplication program was initiated in 2005/06 season in three selected villages. Focus group discussions (FGD's) were used to identify important crops for the area and their related constraints. A scaling-out program was then designed and implemented with farmer participation. The main research objective was to identify and test a mechanism for accelerating food crop production in a community where availability, use and production knowledge of improved main food crops are low. The guiding principles were to identify an easy-to-administer crop production intervention within reach of resources and management capacity of the researchers, extension system and farmers. The hypothesis was that by working with a few eager farmers to multiply seeds of improved varieties of cassava and legumes, the seed would spread out through organised or informal sales and sharing. The FGD's showed that maize (Zea mays L.), cassava ( Manihot esculent a Crantz), pigeon peas (Cajanus cajan {L.}. Millspaugh), cowpeas (Vigna unguiculata {L.} Walpers) and bambara groundnuts (Vigna subterranea {L.} Verd) were main food crops. Poor access to seeds of improved crop varieties and knowledge of improved production technological packages were noted as main constraints. For maize, lack of inorganic fertilizers and poor soil fertility were other constraints. The results of the seed multiplication program showed that out of 63 farmers planned to participate in seed production, 21 took part. Some 38 farmers were identified for further multiplication. Those that participated were also trained, and indicated that they learned new skills and concepts quite useful to their farming. The low success rate was attributed to lack of commitment and unpreparedness to fence cassava and pigeon peas crops. Scaling out of seed amongst farmers may be enhanced through promotion of sales, rather than sharing. It was anticipated that the knowledge that new seeds, particularly of cassava cuttings, are available would prevail and farmers would transact with it further.																			1991-637X					JUN	2008	3	6					440	447																WOS:000259934400010

A total of 75 females and 107 males bred for 144 .female..female. yr and 200 .male..male. yr. The observed skew in the population sex ratio was due primarily to behavioral exclusion of inexperienced females. Density appeared to limit population size and productivity. Locally hatched chicks accounted for 31 and 40% of the breeding females in the final 2 yr. Females laid eggs for 1.35-2.06 males/yr. Experienced females had significantly more mates, eggs, chicks and fledglings than did inexperienced females. Locally hatched chicks accounted for 21 and 19% of the breeding males in the final 2 yr. Males mated with 1.0-1.4 females/yr. Experienced males had more mates and received more replacement eggs than did inexperienced males; in contrast to females inexperienced males had no less hatching or fledging success than did experienced males. Marked females (38) and 16 marked males tried unsuccessfully to enter the population, and 6 females and no males were observed to be nonbreeders all season long. Of 1142 eggs, 442 hatched and 256 fledged. Experienced birds returned to breed more often in subsequent years than did inexperienced ones (61 vs. 50%). Return rates of successful birds were consistently higher than those of unsuccessful birds, the difference decreasing with age. Young males appeared to be less site-faithful than were females and older males. Successfully breeding females lived an average of 3.7 yr. Relative to other scolopacids with multipurpose territories, the spotted sandpiper is considered a pioneering species that quickly and frequently colonizes new sites, emigrates in response to reproductive failure, breeds first at an early age, lives a relatively short time, lays many eggs per female per year and has relatively low nest success.																				1938-4254					1983	100	2					272	285		10.1093/auk/100.2.272	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/auk/100.2.272													WOS:A1983QX26300002
J	Link, JS; Keen, RE				Link, JS; Keen, RE			A model of salmonid planktivory: field test of a mechanistic approach to size-selection	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												A mechanistic model was developed to simulate the planktivory process for the pelagic lake herring (Coregonus artedi) on common crustacean zooplankton of Lake Superior. The model was constructed as a product of probabilities associated with detection, attack, capture and retention. Sensitivity analysis showed that these coefficients were robust and that initial zooplankton density affected the model behavior more than altering the coefficients. The model output provides percent composition of adult lake herring stomach contents. Zooplankton communities from several stations and seasons in Lake Superior were sampled to provide an initializing zooplankton community for the model. Model output was then contrasted with simultaneously field caught lake herring stomachs. The model predictions agreed with the observed stomach contents at an average accuracy of 80%. The overall agreement of the predictions with observed stomach contents is suggestive that the mechanisms modeled track planktivore feeding dynamics adequately. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

From the return data the geomorphology team interpreted the region to consist of compressionally deformed, ancient marine sediments and igneous rocks exposed by more recent extensional tectonics. Unconsolidated alluvial materials blanket the lower flanks of the mountains. Bn ancient shoreline cut into alluvial material marks a high stand of water during a past, wetter climate period. Playa sediments floor a present-day, seasonally, dry lake. Observations made by the rover using panoramic and close-up (hand specimens-scale) image data and color scene data confirmed the presence of boulders, cobbles, and fines of various provinces. Rover traverses to sites identified as geologically distinct, such as fan, channel, shoreline, and playa, provided useful clues to the geologic interpretations. Analysis of local rocks was given concert only through comparison with distant geologic features. These results demonstrated the importance of a multifaceted approach to site interpretation through comparison of interpretations derived by differing geologic techniques.																			2169-9097	2169-9100				APR 25	2001	106	E4					7665	7682		10.1029/1999JE001167	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/1999JE001167													WOS:000168288300009
J	Kolpakov, NV				Kolpakov, N. V.			Fish production in estuaries of Primorye	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF MARINE BIOLOGY												Production of fish communities in 15 different-types estuaries was assessed based on the data collected as a result of 90 surveys (860 seine stations) conducted in Primorye in 2002-2015. The main contribution to production was made by semi-anadromous species (the so-iuy mullet Liza haematocheilus, Far Eastern redfins Tribolodon spp., and Japanese smelt Hypomesus nipponensis, etc.). In both external (EP (ext)) and internal (EP (int)) polyhaline estuaries (EP) a substantial portion of the production was provided by resident marine species (mainly by the saffron cod Eleginus gracilis, Far Eastern smooth flounder Liopsetta pinnifasciata, and tidepool gunnel Pholis nebulosa) and southern immigrants (flathead grey mullet Mugil cephalus, dotted gizzard shad Konosirus punctatus, Japanese halfbeak Hyporhamphus sajori, and Pacific needlefish Strongylura anastomella). In mesohaline (EM) and oligohaline (EO) estuaries, the proportion of marine residents and southern immigrants was reduced to a minimum, while that of freshwater species (bighead gudgeon Gobio macrocephalus, Prussian carp Carassius gibelio, minnow Phoxinus spp., Amur bitterling Rhodeus sericeus, spiny bitterlings Acanthorhodeus spp., etc.) substantially added to the production of semi-anadromous fish. The mean fish biomass for the vegetation season varied in the 143-1463 mgC/m(2) range; the mean annual production was 174-4267 mgC/m(2) and the mean P/B ratio was 0.2-3.2. In 2007, the high annual production in the Artemovka River estuary, 9356 mgC/m(2), was formed by the juvenile so-iuy mullet of the strong yearclass that hatched in 2006. The lowest mean production and P/B values were typical mainly for the water bodies with a salinity more often close to that of the barrier zones (5-8aEuro degrees for alpha-horohalinicum and 22-26aEuro degrees for beta-horohalinicum), i.e., for EM and EP (ext). This relationship is explained by the features of the osmotic regulation in fish of various origins and its ontogenetic variations. In particularly, the salinity in EM is more frequently close to the critical salinity (5-8aEuro degrees, alpha-horohalinicum); thus, the proportion of juveniles of most of the species in the catches decreases (as their resistance to salinity variations is lower). This results in higher mean values of the specific and absolute production of fish communities in EP (int) and EO as compared to those in EM. The conclusion was made that the estimates of fish production in the estuaries of Primorye are similar to those in the well-studied estuaries of the temperate, subtropical, and tropical zones. Moreover, they are comparable to the fish production estimates for mesotrophic and eutrophic lakes in northwestern Russia, substantially lower than those for large lowland rivers, and higher than those for small rivers. The fish production in seas, including the Japan/East Sea (0.20 gC/m(2)) and, particularly, Peter the Great Bay (0.28 gC/m(2)), is mostly lower than that in Primorye estuaries.																			1063-0740	1608-3377				DEC	2016	42	7					551	567		10.1134/S1063074016070063	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1063074016070063													WOS:000394281200003

Ancient Fishing Methods and Fishing Grounds in the Lake of Galilee	PALESTINE EXPLORATION QUARTERLY												Fishing was an important economic activity in the Lake of Galilee during the Roman period. This study proposes a comparative analysis involving archaeological remains, classic literature, ancient art and modern ethnographical accounts regarding fishing in the Kinneret to produce an historical reconstruction of the ancient commercial fishing methods. Furthermore, it aims to individuate the most important fishing areas, the fishing seasons, and to the roll of cities and towns around the Kinneret within the fishing industry.																			0031-0328	1743-1301				DEC	2016	148	4					281	293		10.1080/00310328.2016.1185845	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00310328.2016.1185845													WOS:000390428600005
J	MATTHEWS, RA; MATTHEWS, GB; EHINGER, WJ				MATTHEWS, RA; MATTHEWS, GB; EHINGER, WJ			CLASSIFICATION AND ORDINATION OF LIMNOLOGICAL DATA - A COMPARISON OF ANALYTICAL TOOLS	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												In this paper we compare the differences between principal components analysis, hierarchical clustering, correspondence analysis and conceptual clustering to show their effectiveness for identifying patterns in a large limnological data set. The data for this comparison come from a multi-year study of Lake Whatcom, a large lake located in the Puget Sound lowlands of the state of Washington. The data include both physical and chemical parameters (temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, alkalinity, turbidity, conductivity, and nutrients) as well as biological parameters (Secchi depth, chlorophyll a, and phytoplankton species and total counts). The patterns we expected to find include (a) temperature and dissolved oxygen interactions, (b) ordination by algal bloom sequences, and (c) clustering due to the effects of stratification. Principal components analysis was somewhat useful for confirming known water quality trends, but did not successfully identify large-scale patterns such as stratification and seasonal plankton changes. Correspondence analysis proved to be superior to principal components analysis for detecting phytoplankton trends, but was not as good for interpreting water quality changes. Hierarchical clustering produced highly unbalanced trees for both the water quality and phytoplankton data, and was useless as an exploratory tool. A new approach to clustering, implemented in the computer program RIFFLE, is introduced here. This clustering algorithm outperformed the other exploratory tools in clustering and parameter ordination, and successfully identified a number of expected and unexpected patterns in the limnological data.																			0304-3800					APR	1991	53	3-4					167	187		10.1016/0304-3800(91)90155-T	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3800(91)90155-T													WOS:A1991FP96600001

A study of 8 marl lakes in southern Ontario [Canada] that are actively precipitating calcium carbonate was conducted in order to assess those isotopic and aqueous geochemical parameters in modern lakes that may be utilized to estimate the history and extent of variations in the hardwater effect along such sediment sequences. Results show an increase in the .delta.13C composition of lake DIC (dissolved inorganic carbon) as approach to isotopic equilibrium with atmospheric CO2 occurs. Differences in the extent to which this equilibrium is established also appear responsible for observed differences in the 14C activity of DIC between lakes of as much as 20 pmc (percent modern Ca). These variations have been related to the relative residence times of water in each lake by examination of their corresponding seasonal variations in 18O and 2H content. Consequently, .delta.13C and .delta.18O of marl and mollusks were used to identify variations in the hardwater effect along the sediment profile. A profile of radiocarbon dates on marl from Little Lake in southern Ontario shows satisfactory agreement with an independently determined pollen chronology. Where certain criteria are met, marl deposits appear to be suitable material for establishing Quaternary chronology.

J	Schneider, JM; Garbrecht, JD				Schneider, J. M.; Garbrecht, J. D.			Reductions in seasonal climate forecast dependability as a result of downscaling	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE												This investigation addresses a practical question from an agricultural planning and management perspective: are the NOAA/CPC seasonal climate forecasts skillful enough to retain utility after they have been downscaled to field and daily scales for use in crop models to predict impacts on crop production? Utility is defined herein as net forecast dependabilities of at least 50%, where net dependability is the product of the large-scale 3-month forecast dependability with a factor accounting for losses in dependability due to the higher spatiotemporal variability of 1-month station data. This loss factor is estimated from station data by computing the frequency of matching sign (FOMS) between the direction of departures from average of 3-month forecast division values and 1-month station values, for average temperature and precipitation, over a 10-year study period and 96 stations in six regions of the U.S. The resulting FOMS does not display any consistent differences across regions, locations, or months, so is averaged across all months and stations. Average FOMS calculated in this manner are 76% for average temperature and 66% for total precipitation. The decimal FOMS are then used as the multiplicative loss factor on previously reported 3-month forecast division reliability values to produce estimates of the net reliability for downscaled forecasts at locations within each forecast division. The resulting guidance is dependent on region and forecast variable, with the forecasts for above-average temperature emerging as worthy of consideration for use in agricultural applications over the majority of the contiguous U.S. The Northeast, the Great Lakes, parts of the Northern Great Plains, interior California, and northwest Nevada are the only regions with insufficient net dependability to preclude immediate consideration. Conversely, forecasts for cooler than average temperature do not retain sufficient net dependability after downscaling to be an attractive option in any part of the contiguous U.S. at this time. Forecasts for wetter or drier than average conditions retained sufficient net dependability to encourage further development over only about 10% of the contiguous U.S., in regions well-known to experience the strongest ENSO impacts on precipitation. The forecast divisions where agricultural decision support might benefit from NOAA/CPC seasonal precipitation forecasts are located in Florida, south Texas, southwest New Mexico, Arizona, central and southern California, and parts of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and Montana.																			0001-2351					MAY-JUN	2008	51	3					915	925																WOS:000258425600014
J	PHARO, EJ; KIRKPATRICK, JB				PHARO, EJ; KIRKPATRICK, JB			VEGETATION OF THE ALPINE SAND DUNES AT LAKE AUGUSTA, TASMANIA	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Alpine sand dunes are a rare phenomenon. On the Central Plateau of Tasmania parabolic dunes occur on the leeward of glaciofluvial lakes. The largest such complex is at Lake Augusta where seven sand dune communities and two slack communities were recognized from a sorted table produced by a polythetic divisive classification of floristic data. Fen was found on the rocky parts of the lake shore, while short alpine herbfield ('marsupial lawn') occurred in seasonally inundated slacks. Freshly mobilized sand had distinct shrubland communities, two of which exclusively occupied the fresh sand of the foredunes, while one occurred on remobilized older soils. Three communities formed a toposequence on the older soils of the well-drained dunes. Zonation was not strong beyond the foredune. Species richness and height generally increased inland. The older soils were more nutrient rich than the younger sands, a phenomenon probably attributable to the ultimate igneous origin of the material. The dunes have considerable conservation significance. Activities that could cause further mobilization need to be restricted.

Hyalella azteca (Amphipoda) inhabiting macrophyte beds in eight Canadian Shield lakes were sampled during the ice-free seasons of 1984 and 1985. These amphipods were found to be predominantly univoltine in contrast to suggestions from a previous study. 2. Annual production determined by the size-frequency method ranged from 1.21 to 2.77g dry wt m(-2) year(-1), and are the highest rates recorded for this species in temperate waters. 3. Turnover rates (P/B ratios) ranged from 2.27 to 3.48 and are among the lowest values that have been measured. A synthesis of these data indicates that H. azteca turnover rates increase sigmoidally with degree-days above 5 degrees C.						france, robert/0000-0002-9171-8426													0046-5070					DEC	1993	30	3					343	349		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1993.tb00818.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1993.tb00818.x													WOS:A1993MN34700001
J	SIMON, M				SIMON, M			GROWTH-CHARACTERISTICS OF SMALL AND LARGE FREE-LIVING AND ATTACHED BACTERIA IN LAKE CONSTANCE	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												The growth characteristics of small (0.2-1.0 .mu.m) and large (1.0-3.0 .mu.m) free-living and attached bacteria were studied in Lake Constance by comparing the spatial and seasonal dynamics of their biomass turnover time (ratio of biomass/production). The biomass of small free-living bacteria usually turned over significantly faster than that of large free-living bacteria throughout the water column. The turnover of attached bacterial biomass was characterized by large fluctuations. Occasionally, in aphotic water layers, it was as long as that of large free-living bacteria, but when large amounts of decaying organic particles were present, it was shorter than that of small free-living cells. Biomass turnover times of free-living bacteria were in the same range as their generation times, which were estimated from the increase in bacterial abundance in 3 .mu.m prefiltered samples. The biomass turnover time of actively metabolizing bacteria was comparable to the generation time of actively metabolizing cells. These results indicate that the biomass turnover time is a useful indicator of the growth of different bacterial fractions, as it reflects their different amounts of participation in microbial processes of aquatic ecosystems.																			0095-3628	1432-184X					1988	15	2					151	163		10.1007/BF02011709	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02011709								24202998					WOS:A1988M091400004
J	COOPER, CM				COOPER, CM			BENTHOS IN BEAR-CREEK, MISSISSIPPI - EFFECTS OF HABITAT VARIATION AND AGRICULTURAL SEDIMENTS	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												The macroinvertebrate fauna of Bear Creek, a 83 km stream which flows through six oxbow lakes, and two ff-stream lakes in the same watershed was studied for two years. Bear Creek, a tributary of the Yazoo River in the Delta region of Mississippi, drains 330 km2 of intensively cultivated agricultural land and carries a continuing sediment concentration during the rainy season of up to 1300 mg l-1. Benthic organisms were collected monthly from August, 1976 through August, 1978 at six stream stations and at 14 lake stations, across a variety of substrates, and at depths ranging from 0.5 to 6.5 m. In most lake and stream sections of the creek, Chaoborus (one species), Chironomidae (nineteen genera), and Oligochaeta (three species), dominated the benthos. Thirteen other genera of insects were represented as were Bryozoa (four genera), Mollusca (nine genera), Hirudinea (five genera), and Crustacea (three genera). There was continuous stress from high rates of sedimentation (up to seven cm yr-1) as indicated by low taxa richness(s) and diversity (d) at a majority of stations sampled. Most creek stations were subject not only to annual sedimentation and flushing but also to fluctuations in water leveland drying. Secondary productivity varied greatly (one to 31 g dry wt m-2 yr-1) and was almost totally dependent on three taxa of pollution tolerant organisms except in unstressed stream reaches. Low productivity in riverine lakes, when compared to stream sections was partially due to differences in species distribution in lotic and lentic habitats. The mayfly Hexagenia bilineata, the clam Sphaerium rhomboideum, and the bryozoan Pectinatella magnifica, responded negatively to environmental stresses induced by seasonally high concentrations of suspended sediments.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				JUN	1987	4	1					101	113		10.1080/02705060.1987.9665167	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1987.9665167													WOS:A1987H729300013
J	Spencer, M; Fisher, NS; Wang, WX; Ferson, S				Spencer, M; Fisher, NS; Wang, WX; Ferson, S			Temporal variability and ignorance in Monte Carlo contaminant bioaccumulation models:: A case study with selenium in Mytilus edulis	RISK ANALYSIS												Although the parameters for contaminant bioaccumulation models most likely vary over time, lack of data makes it impossible to quantify this variability. As a consequence, Monte Carlo models of contaminant bioaccumulation often treat all parameters as having fixed true values that are unknown. This can lead to biased distributions of predicted contaminant concentrations. This article demonstrates this phenomenon with a case study of selenium accumulation in the mussel Mytilus edulis in San Francisco Bay. "Ignorance-only" simulations (in which phytoplankton and bioavailable selenium concentrations are constant over time, but sampled from distributions of field measurements taken at different times), which an analyst might be forced to use due to lack of data, were compared with "variability and ignorance" simulations (sampling phytoplankton and bioavailable selenium concentrations each month). It was found that ignorance only simulations may underestimate or overestimate the median predicted contaminant concentration at any time, relative to variability and ignorance simulations. However, over a long enough time period (such as the complete seasonal cycle in a seasonal model), treating temporal variability as if it were ignorance at least gave a range of predicted concentrations that enclosed the range predicted by explicit treatment of temporal variability. Comparing the temporal variability in field data with that predicted by simulations may indicate whether the right amount of temporal variability is being included in input variables. Sensitivity analysis combined with biological knowledge suggests which parameters might make important contributions to temporal variability. Temporal variability is potentially more complicated to deal with than other types of stochastic variability, because of the range of time scales over which parameters may vary.

The results showed that EUS-like lesions developed in 6 to 14 d among naive snakeheads cohabiting with EUS snakeheads and with apparently healthy snakeheads in lakewater (Treatments C and D). Among naive fish exposed to lakewater (Treatment B), similar lesions developed in 16 to 21 d, while naive fish in aquifer water (Treatment A) did not develop EUS-like lesions. EUS signs began as Grade I (slight) lesions that gradually progressed to Grades III-IV (severe) 3 to 5 d from lesion onset, similar to the naturally affected EUS fish. The virus was recovered from some but not all naturally EUS-affected snakeheads, snakeheads with healing lesions and apparently healthy snakeheads, but not from naive snakeheads. The results provide evidence of a waterborne horizontal transmission of the EUS-associated virus. This is the first report of a successful horizontal transmission of the EUSassociated virus from apparently healthy snakeheads to naive fish under natural conditions and of virus recovery in tissue culture from naturally exposed experimental fish.																			0177-5103					DEC 29	2003	57	3					213	220		10.3354/dao057213	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/dao057213								14960033					WOS:000220379300004
J	Evans, JH				Evans, JH			Spatial and seasonal distribution of phytoplankton in an African Rift Valley lake (L. Albert, Uganda, Zaire)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												An account is given of the seasonal succession and spatial distribution of phytoplankton derived from a one-year sampling programme (1961-62) on Lake Albert, a large African rift lake. There is evidence of regulation by both physical and nutrient factors. These are influenced by a marked seasonality of temperature/density stratification (temperature range <3 degrees C) and of water input that induces some polarization along the axis of the lake. Prevailing concentrations of soluble reactive phosphorus are high (>100 mu g l(-1)), but those of inorganic nitrogen are low and, with large depletions of silicate-silicon, may limit algal production. The diatom and cyanophyte components of the phytoplankton show different relationships to the seasonal cycle of limited stratification and vertical mixing. There are possible relationships, by grazing, to the described seasonal and spatial abundance of planktonic Cladocera. Comparisons are made with other African lakes, especially Lake Turkana which is of similar shape and size and shows end to end polarization of the aquatic biota.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP 26	1997	354						1	16		10.1023/A:1003026415788	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003026415788													WOS:000071762900001

This paper describes a small-diameter SUBglacial SEdiment Vibrocorer (SUBSEV) designed especially for coring sediments from beneath Antarctic ice shelves through an access hole formed with a hot-water drill. The maximum diameter of the SUBSEV corer is 270 mm, the total length of the corer is 4.1 m, it weighs 214 kg, it is designed to sample at least 3 m of sediment without disturbance, and it can work at water depths down to 3000 m. A cylindrical, self-synchronous, dual-motor vibrator was designed to deal with the size restrictions of the hole. Actuating motors rotating in opposite directions can generate vertical, horizontal, or alternative vibrations. In the course of laboratory testing, the SUBSEV corer easily penetrated to a depth of 3.4 m in a sediment composed of fine-screened sand, loess, and soil with a coring speed of 70-100 mm/s. The maximum penetration speed was reached in the alternate vibration mode. Field testing of the SUBSEV corer is planned within a hot-water ice-drilling project on Amery Ice Shelf, East Antarctica in the 2017-2018 season.

The annual maxima ranging from 3.2 to 13 g/m3 are within the range considered as characteristic of eutrophic waters. The highest phytoplankton biomass developed after a very dry period; the nitrogen fixation by N2-fixing cyanophytes and the release of ammonia nitrogen, phosphorus and silica from the anoxic sediment may have been the main sources of nutrient supply in Lake Volvi during the dry, warm period.

J	BOYD, ML; LENTZ, GL				BOYD, ML; LENTZ, GL			SEASONAL INCIDENCE OF THE CABBAGE SEEDPOD WEEVIL (COLEOPTERA, CURCULIONIDAE) ON RAPESEED IN WEST TENNESSEE	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												Populations of the cabbage seedpod weevil, Ceutorhynchus assimilis (Paykull), were sampled in Fayette, Haywood, Henry, and Lake counties in seven and eight commercial rapeseed, Brassica napus spp. oleifera L., field sites in 1990 and 1991, respectively. The cabbage seedpod weevil was the most abundant (98.8%) of the eight curculionid species collected. Adult C. assimilis populations were monitored weekly from 7 April to 4 June 1990 and from 10 April to 4 June 1991. During early season, overwintering C. assimilis adult populations peaked on 27 April 1990 and 11 April 1991, respectively. Late in the season, adult C. assimilis (probable F1) populations peaked again on 4 June 1990 and 22 May 1991, respectively. Cabbage seedpod weevil populations were relatively low at sites in 1990; however, the total weevil population in Henry County was 79 times higher than that in Lake County in 1991. In the absence of commercial rapeseed fields, weevil densities in 1993 were 229 times greater on turnip, B. rapa L., in Henry County than in Lake County. A hypothesis for the higher weevil populations is that Henry County has more available alternate hosts and overwintering sites. Because rapeseed is new and C. assimilis is well adapted to this host, weevil infestations will likely increase and severely damage rapeseed stands as plantings increase in West Tennessee.																			0046-225X					AUG	1994	23	4					900	905		10.1093/ee/23.4.900	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/23.4.900													WOS:A1994PC62800017
J	WAY, CM				WAY, CM			DYNAMICS OF FILTER-FEEDING IN MUSCULIUM-TRANSVERSUM (BIVALVIA, SPHAERIIDAE)	JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY												Filtration rates of Musculium transversum from Brown''s Lake, Mississippi, [USA] were measured at suspended particle concentrations spanning the yearly ambient range. Filtration rates for adult clams increased as particle concentrations increased from 5 to 26 mg/L, then decreased with further increases in particle (2-.mu.m microspheres) concentration. Maximal filtration rates were observed at particle concentrations near the mean annual average (15.2 and 15.7 ml/hr at 18 and 26 mg/L, respectively). The effects of particle size and type on filtration rates were examined using microspheres of various sizes, natural suspended particles, and Chlorella at the mean ambient suspended particle concentration. Filtration rates were highest when measured with particle sizes most commonly encountered in the water column. There was also no difference in filtration rates measured with 5-.mu.m microspheres and similar sized Chlorella. Musculium transversum could not retain particles less than 1 .mu. in size indicating that ciliary feeding structures act as a sieve with a minimum mesh size of approximately 1 .mu.m. Pseudofeces were produced by all sizes of clams at particle concentrations greater than 26 mg/L and at particle sizes greater than 7 .mu.m for newborn and medium sized clams and 11 .mu.m for large clams. Thus morphological constraints on the gill limit the range of particle concentrations and sizes that can be effectively processed. Laboratory observations demonstrated the potential for deposit feeding in M. transversum in habitats that have rich organic substrates, low quantity or poor quality for suspended food, or seasonal variation in the abundance of suspended food.																			0887-3593					SEP	1989	8	3					243	249		10.2307/1467328	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1467328													WOS:A1989AQ64900006

Radionuclide levels were significantly elevated in water, sediments and biota at contaminated sites. Radionuclide concentration declined with each successive trophic level due primarily to very low assimilation efficiency. Fish radionuclide concentrations varied with season but did not vary with age or year of sampling. Distribution coefficients were high; therefore, a large proportion of radionuclides entering the systems go to the solid phase. Organisms feeding on or near sediments had higher radionuclide levels than pelagic species. There is a potential for long-term cycling of radionuclides from sediments through food chains due to low flux and sedimentation rates. With the exception of water .fwdarw. insects and water .fwdarw. fish all transfer coefficients (TC) were low, usually less than one. Control TCs were greater than TCs in contaminated areas. Radium-226 and 210Pb TCs declined dramatically at the insect-fish level. Uranium uptake from water by insects and fish was much less than 226Ra or 210Pb uptake. Uptake from sediments was similar for all nuclides in insects but 210Pb sediment-fish TCs differed from 226Ra or U TCs. The critical pathway in the contaminated area was sediments .fwdarw. insects .fwdarw. forage fish .fwdarw. whitefish .fwdarw. man. Estimated internal dose rates to large fish in the contaminated area were 1-2 rad/y. Dose to humans from consumption of one fish serving per week for 1 y was 2% of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) annual limit for the general public.																			0017-9078	1538-5159					1985	49	5					747	770		10.1097/00004032-198511000-00008	http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/00004032-198511000-00008								4066338					WOS:A1985AUS1000009
J	BANCROFT, GT				BANCROFT, GT			PATTERNS OF VARIATION IN SIZE OF BOAT-TAILED GRACKLE QUISCALUS-MAJOR EGGS	IBIS												Boat-tailed gracle Q. major eggs averaged 8.09 g wet weight. Mean egg weight represented 8.05% of female body weight. Based on egg weight, grackle eggs have a shorter incubation period than the general passerine pattern. Egg weight varied significantly with sequence of laying and between clutches in both 2-egg and 3-egg clutches. Last laid eggs weighted less than 1st laid eggs. The mean weight of the first 2-eggs laid in 3-egg clutches did not differ from the mean egg weight of 2-egg clutches. The average clutch of 2 and 3 eggs weighted 16.33 g and 24.16 g, resepctively. Mean egg weight varied between study colonies and with season Grackles at East Lake laid eggs that weighed less than grackles at either Alligator Lake or North Lake [Florida, USA]. Eggs laid during March averaged less than eggs laid later in the season. The locality variation relfects the different timing of nesting between sites rather than food abundance. As nutrient provisioning increases with an increase in egg weight, the seasonal change in egg weight probably reflects improved feeding conditions for the female. This suggests that selection favors beginning laying before reserves of the female are sufficient to lay the largest egg possible. The size of the young at hatching was correlated with egg size. Newly htached young averaged 79.6% of fresh egg weight. Egg weight did not determine the probability of hatching or starvation of the young. Females do not appear to adjust egg size facultatively depending on the sex of the young. Eggs producing males and females did not vary significantly in weight, whether comparisons were made within or between clutches.																			0019-1019	1474-919X					1984	126	4					496	509		10.1111/j.1474-919X.1984.tb02076.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1474-919X.1984.tb02076.x													WOS:A1984TW51700004

In November 1993, 13 tagged fish were released in an area which would be flooded by the Petit-Saut reservoir impoundment in mid-1994. Seven other tagged fish were released in January 1994, 20 km upstream of the upper limit of the reservoir. Hoplias aimara showed site fidelity: 75% of fish returned to their capture site before the test area was inundated. The remaining fish stayed close to the release area. Monitoring during three 24-h cycles before reservoir filling showed that H. aimara has a limited home range, which is less marked in unconstrained reaches during the wet season (April to August) than in constrained reaches during the dry season (September to November). In natural conditions, H. aimara has a wider home range in unconstrained river reaches than in constrained river reaches. After closure of the dam, in September and October 1994 (dry season, low water) more than half of the total H. aimara tagged in the flooded zone migrated upstream following the rise of water.

The range of the LAS concentration in sediments was between 0.1 and 500-mu-g g-1 (C-11-C-14 homologs per dry solid) and its vertical profile showed a seasonal variation. A mathematical model, which includes a diffusion term and a biodegradation term, was used to simulate the temporal variation of LAS in the sediment column and to calculate the diffusive flux rate of LAS across the sediment/water interface. An averaged diffusion coefficient of 2.4 x 10(-5) cm2 S-1 for the sediment interstitial water was obtained from sediment core samples located in Lake Teganuma. The biodegradation rate constant (0.002 d-1) of LAS in the sediment obtained from the model analysis was considerably less than that reported for LAS in anaerobic waters. These results confirm that a model describing diffusive transport and biodegradation of LAS in the sediments can simulate the temporal variation of LAS in near surface sediments. The diffusive flux rate from overlying water to bottom sediment was calculated to be between -0.20 and 0.52 (C-11-C-14 LAS) mg m-2 h-1 and the annual net flux rate was 0.7 g m-2 y-1.

Diversity of eukaryotic plankton of aquaculture ponds with Carassius auratus gibelio, using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES SCIENCES												PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) were used to explore the relationship between eukaryotic plankton community succession and environmental factors in two aquaculture pond models with gibel carp Carassius auratus gibelio. The main culture species of pond 1 were gibel carp and grass carp, and the combined density was 46224 fingerling/ha (gibel carp/grass carp/silver carp/bighead carp, 17:4:6:1). The main culture species of pond 2 was gibel carp, and the combined density was 37551 fingerling/ha (Gibel carp/silver carp/bighead carp, 52:1:1). Water samples were collected monthly. The results showed that the annual average concentrations of TP and PO4-P in pond 1were significantly higher than pond 2 (p>0.05). The concentration of chlorophyll a (chl a) has no significantly difference between pond 1 and pond 2. DGGE profiles of 18S rRNA gene fragments from the two ponds revealed that the diversity of eukaryotic plankton assemblages was highly variable. 91 bands and 71 bands were detected in pond 1 and pond 2, respectively. The average Shannon-Wiener index of pond 1 was significantly higher than pond 2. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) revealed that temperature played a key role in the structure of the eukaryotic plankton community in both ponds, but the nutrient concentration did not affect it. Our results suggest that DGGE method is a cost-effective way to gain insight into seasonal dynamics of eukaryotic plankton communities in culture ponds, and the increase in the number of filter-feeding silver carp and bighead carp could increase the diversity of the eukaryotic plankton community.																			1562-2916					OCT	2016	15	4					1540	1555																WOS:000392389000020

Two different migration types were observed: diurnal rhythmical migrations between the littoral and pelagic zones, and sporadic locomotions such as spontaneous excursions of several kilometers distance. At night, during their sojourn in the shallow littoral zone, bream feed intensively on benthic organisms; during their stay in the pelagic areas they presumably feed on zooplankton. Sporadic changes of place enable the bream to feed on locally abundant food resoures.

Climate change in the North - past, present, and future	EPISODES					33rd International Geological Congress	AUG 06-14, 2008	Oslo, NORWAY					The Nordic countries have produced famous polar explorers and researchers who have generated climate research schools at a variety of locations. The dependence of these countries with respect to the lifelihood of their societies, of their use of lands and seas, the exploitation of marine living and non-living resources have made climate research an eminent topic, and many outstanding discoveries of long- and short-term climate change have been made for the first time in Scandinavia. These include early contributions to our understanding of the geological effects of continent-wide glaciations during the ice ages, the complex postglacial history of the Baltic Sea and the varved sediment sequences preserved from lakes with an extraordinary seasonality in their sediment input, as well as the detailed records of temperature, ice texture and impurities and greenhouse gas variations of the last Glacial and of the Holocene preserved in the ice cores from Greenland. Iceland with its volcanic sequences and intercalated sediment layers not only preserved the history of this subaerial segment of the mid-Atlantic Ridge, but also easily datable paleo-climate records. The fate of the Vikings, who settled during the Medieval climate optimum on Iceland and later on Greenland and who lost their habitat on Greenland at the beginning of the Little Ice Age, illustrates vividly the climate-dependent subsistence of the indigenous and non-indigenous Scandinavian populations. Modern Scandinavian climate research. institutions also include sophisticated modelling groups.

This answers questions about the seasonal and geographic pattern of anthropogenic acid precursor emissions and reaction products (SO42-, NO3-, H+, NH4+) that increase from west to east. Except for higher concentrations of Ca2+ and Mg2+ observed at one site in the cultivated area of southwestern Minnesota, the contribution of soil-related metal cations to the total ions in solution is small (17%) and relatively uniform across the region. Significant seasonal and geographic patterns in precipitation chemistry and deposition values are observed. Close correspondence of the sums of strong acid anions with the sums of hydrogen and ammonium ions in precipitation is observed, indicating anthropogenic sources of sulfur and nitrogen oxides. Present atmospheric inputs show close chemical correspondence when precipitation chemistry values are compared to the resulting ionic composition of weakly buffered lakes in north central Wisconsin and northern Michigan. The wet deposition of total acidity in the middle and eastern part of the region is comparable to that of impacted sites in the Adirondacks [USA] and in regions of Scandinavia.																			0013-936X	1520-5851				JAN	1986	20	1					35	43		10.1021/es00143a003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es00143a003								22300148					WOS:A1986AWX8900006

TP is used to monitor reproductive efficiency as well as changes in management strategies, estrous detection and artificial insemination. TP was determined in 2,451 crossbred cows belonged to 6 farms located in the Perija zone at the Maracaibo Lake Basin, 3 under traditional and 3 under improved management system. TP was assessed in a direct form, no computerized, in eligible cows defined as those detected in heat and inseminated with voluntary waiting period >60 days during 18 periods of 3 weeks each between March 1998 and February 1999. Periods, breeding season and management system were considered as independent variables. Data were analysed through SAS proc GLM, and the comparison between the variables were performed using the Duncan test procedures. Between periods the variation of TP fluctuated from 8.1 to 22.3% (mean 16.4%) and the same tendency showed DC and F. The TP was higher (P<0.01) between December-February (19.3%) and March-May (18.8%). June and August showed the lower TP (11.5%) and this can be imputed to the higher temperatures and the temperature-humidity Index. DC, fertility and TP were superior (P<0.01) in improved than in traditional management farms (37.1, 52.3 and 19.4% vs 29.6, 47.3 and 14% respectively). In dual purpose cows, the lower TP is more related with DC problems due to anestrous than for deficient detection of the estrous or low fertility. TP should be evaluated continuously in order to achieve a large number of cow pregnant, for maximizing reproductive efficiency, and to increase the potential net income.																			0798-2259					NOV-DEC	2003	13	6					440	447																WOS:000187318100004

Three main types of late Quaternary deposits have been recorded: Uniform "sheet drape" series deposited on the successive sub-lacustrine topographies, chaotic "basin fill" accumulations lying in the deepest parts of the different basin units and finally "gravity flows" located at the foot of the steepest slopes and illustrated by bars and fans. Those three sedimentary facies are related to distinct processes and dynamics: 1. The "sheet drape" deposits are made of autochtonous seasonal organic accumulations (algal blooms: diatoms principally), combined with recurrent fine detrital inputs which come from the continuous erosion of the high rift shoulders. Moreover, casual arrivals of oxidized fine material deriving from the north-south drainage of the northernmost Ruzizi delta plain is thought to complete the "sheet drape" deposits. These fine detrital causual inputs, deposited on the whole northern basin (300 km long, 50 km wide), are interpreted as intermittent incoming turbid prisms, which would flow from the northern end of the lake, inside the water column. The extraordinary uniformity of the "sheet drape" seismic sequences over the whole of the slopes and basin units of the northern basin (despite the occurrence of major bathymetric thresholds), induces the occurrence of a clear stratification of the lake waters, as well as high scale north-south currents which may distribute the fine detrital charge of the recurrent turbid prisms further south, and lead to the formation of this type of cover "sheet drape" sedimentation. 2. Coarse clastic series are infilling the bottom of the elongated depressions of the north-Tanganyika area. These "basin fill" series are interpreted as lacustrine low strand deposits, fed by the eroded alteration cover of the rift shoulders and the probable emerged slopes, as the climate returned to wet conditions. Their geographical distribution as well as their morphological and seismic characters tend to assign them a dense detrital flow origin, in relation to catastrophic rain periods that initiate a new lacustrine transgression, their stratigraphical position (ovelain by high stand "sheet drape" series) being consistent with it. 3. The present day coarse down slope deposits result from gravity mass flows peculiarly recorded during lacustrine high stand, and are due to tectonic instability and to the steepness of the rift shoulders. The local lack of littoral shelf and the steep character of the lacustrine slopes also control this type of gravity mass flows. In one of the basin units studied, these deposits form three little deep fans which are still active at the present day. Seismic stratigraphy analysis allowed us to propose a late Quaternary sedimentary evolution sketch of the north-Tanganyika trough, where climate variations and tectonics appear to be prevalent. Three sedimentary cycles have thus been determined and correlated to significant Quarternary variations of the lake level. Three erosional discontinuities have been recorded and interpreted as lowering of the lake waters or emersion of large sub-lacustrine areas, correlated to regional climatic variations (the inside trough tectonic activity appears to be insufficient, on the late Quaternary time scale, to explain the relative variation of the water level in the lake). Apart from these eustatic considerations, the late Quaternary sediments are the scene of a recent or present singular activity. Numerous superficial intrusive figures, comprising two different types, have been discovered on the high resolution seismic profiles of the northernmost basin unit of the trough, the Bujumbura sub-basin. They are interpreted as sedimentary diapirs (first type) occurring in the central part of the basin, and gas traps located on the shelf and at the foot of the slopes. The decomposition of the abundant organic matter seems to induce the observed reflection envelopes which mask the underlying sediments (gas traps), whereas the sedimentary diapirs clearly rise from the supposed undercompacted fluid rich "basin fill" series previously mentioned. Concerning this last type of intrusion, three distinct processes are thought to control their occurrence: differential compaction between chaotic detrital "basin fill" accumulations and compacted organodetrital "sheet drape" deposits, high regional tectonic instability as well as fluid occurrence and overpressure of which a hydrothermal origin is highly suspected.																			0396-2687					DEC 4	1991	15	2					343	368																WOS:A1991GW26400008

This study was carried out to perceive the impact of ever increasing urbanization in the catchment area of Rawal Lake on inflows of water and sedimentation. Rawal Lake is constructed on Korang River and supplies water for domestic use to Rawalpindi city and Cantonment Area. The results argue that the population in the last eleven years has increased up to 85% at a growth rate of 5.7%, while the built up land has increased 9%. On the other hand area under forest area has been decreased up to 10%. As a result of increase in urbanization inflows to the lake have decreased even though there is no major change in rainfall trend and contributed to the amount of suspended sediment in the inflows. The suspended sediment load was found to be varies from 16.45 tons/day to 1045 tones/day during low to high inflow season.

The congruences in water quality bioassessment based on diversity and biotic indices and using different taxonomic categories were also explored to find the best assessment method of water quality for the lake. All major structural characteristics of macrozoobenthic community, including species composition, abundance, biomass and four biomass-based diversity indices (Shannon's diversity, Simpson's diversity, Pielou's evenness and Simpson's evenness index) fluctuated significantly in season but in space. The above four abundance-based diversity indices plus abundance-based Margalef's richness index did not display significant spatial variations; and significant seasonal differences were found in three indices only. Water temperature was the key environmental factor responsible for macrozoobenthic spatio-temporal distribution patterns. Water quality assessed by Shannon's index (H-a') and biological pollution index (BPI) rather than the other four biotic indices were consistent with those by trophic state index (TSI). Results from chironomids and oligochaetes did not always agree to those from the whole community when H-a' or Hilsenhoff biotic index was applied to bioassessment. Therefore, combining multiple indices and avoiding a single taxonomic category to assess water quality are strongly recommended and in Mingzhu Lake using a mixture of H-a' and BPI will ensure the most effective investigation of water quality.

First description of spatial and temporal patterns of river crossings by European roe deer Capreolus capreolus (Mammalia: Cervidae): characteristics and possible reasons	ITALIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Crossing water bodies (like lakes or rivers) by European roe deer Capreolus capreolus Linnaeus, 1758 is a known phenomenon. However, there is scarce information about the reasons for and patterns of this activity. We analysed 4-year localization data of 13 Global Positioning System-Global System for Mobile Communications (GPS-GSM) collared roe deer living in the floodplain forests of the river Tisza in the Hungarian Great Plain in order to describe such behaviour. Initially, we assumed that this river may represent a barrier for roe deer and we studied the frequency of river crossing occasions, between and within the studied animals. Our questions were: (1) Does the Tisza River act as a barrier to the movements of roe deer? (2) Are there any seasonal or daily variations in the crossing patterns? (3) Is there any difference between males and females regarding the water crossing patterns? (4) Does the water level or the increase in human presence (disturbance by hunting) have any impact on crossings? According to our data, 10 of the 13 individuals crossed the river at least twice, and eight of them did so several times or regularly. The periods spent on the different sides of the river varied from a few hours to several months. During the study period, animals of both sexes crossed the river without difference. There were crossings in all seasons, in daytime and nighttime also. We could not find any difference between the seasons, but there were more crossings in the daytime when we excluded the data of an outlier animal. Water level or human disturbance (live brown hare capture) had no impact on crossings. We conclude that the Tisza River does not represent a real barrier to the movements of roe deer, and our assumption was not supported.

J	MEFFE, GK				MEFFE, GK			LIFE-HISTORY PATTERNS OF GAMBUSIA-MARSHI (POECILIIDAE) FROM CUATRO-CIENEGAS, MEXICO	COPEIA												The life history and ecology of Gambusia marshi, a poeciliid fish endemic to the Cuatro Cienegas basin and Rio Salado drainage of Coahuila, Mexico, is virtually unknown. Fishes collected in different seasons from natural lakes, rivers and an artificial canal were analyzed for reproductive patterns, food choice and parasitism. G. marshi reproduced seasonally, with fecundity increasing as a function of female size. Reproduction is not strongly habitat dependent, although reduced reproductive activity was noted in the canal. Superfetation was infrequent. Major food items of G. marshi were detritus and insects, with other invertebrates, plant material and juvenile fish also represented. Somatic condition was little affected by habitat or season and most individuals were robust. Parasites included two nematodes, a trematode and an acanthocephalan. G. marshi is a habitat and food generalist, which perhaps accounts for its local abundance and success within its limited range.																			0045-8511	1938-5110				DEC 10	1985		4					898	905																WOS:A1985AXC0800009

Eggs from 77 complete clutches were measured. Colonial and noncolonial birds were distinguished and considered separately. First eggs appeared earlier in colonial nests. Colonial nests were situated in lower densities of vegetation than were noncolonial nests. In three of four colonies, nests were situated closer to open water than were noncolonial nests. Clutches of colonial birds were larger than those of noncolonial birds. Over the breeding season, the mean clutch size and the total clutch volume increased for colonial birds, but decreased for noncolonial birds. Biometric data were different for birds nesting in different habitats. Eggs were more elongated at sites closer to open water. Factors accounting for these differences are discussed.					; Bukacinski, Dariusz/KUF-0882-2024; Bukacińska, Monika/AAE-9629-2020	Bukacinska, Monika/0000-0002-4526-3141; Bukacinski, Dariusz/0000-0003-0163-2950; 													0738-6028						1993	16	2					111	118		10.2307/1521429	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1521429													WOS:A1993MP09400001
J	Murthy, CR				Murthy, CR			Particle pathways of Niagara river water in Lake Ontario affecting bottom sediment contamination	HYDROBIOLOGIA					1st International Lake Ladoga Symposium on Ecological Problems of Lake Ladoga	NOV 22-26, 1993	ST PETERSBURG, RUSSIA	Univ Joensuu, Finland, Russian Acad Sci, Inst Limnol				The results of integrated multidisciplinary studies of the transport and pathways of toxic contaminants entering Lake Ontario through the Niagara River are summarized. The factors controlling the transport and distribution of contaminants are: (i) Niagara River mixing characteristics; (ii) prevailing local wind conditions and large scale lake-wide circulation features, and (iii) suspended sediment load and the partitioning of the contaminants onto the suspended solids. Physical limnological studies included a variety of direct measurements to delineate the nearfield and farfield mixing characteristics of the river plume in terms of the prevailing winds and large scale lake circulation. In the 'nearfield' region of the plume, around the river mouth, contaminant transport was affected by the initial momentum and buoyancy of the river water mass and a sharp thermal front that is generally present through the stratified season. After the initial momentum is dissipated, the weakly buoyant river plume responds to the prevailing winds and lake-wide circulation. Adsorbed contaminants rapidly settle once the initial momentum of the river plume is dissipated but the dissolved contaminants are transported into the farfield regions in the lake and after becoming entrained in the strong south shore eastward flowing boundary current are carried toward the St. Lawrence River outflow. Only about ten percent of this eastward flowing transport exits via the St. Lawrence River, the remainder is recirculated back into the main lake. A contaminant transport model of the Niagara River Plume incorporating a hydrodynamic model, observed plume mixing characteristics and chemical partitioning was used to simulate the compartmental distribution (adsorbed vs dissolved) of selected toxic chemicals distribution observed in the nearfield region of the plume.																			0018-8158					APR 12	1996	322	1-3					109	116		10.1007/BF00031814	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00031814													WOS:A1996UT84700018

Destruction of the metastable equilibrium of the surface water layer in the cold season at reverse stratification is suggested as a controlling mechanism of deep-water renewal. A system of one-dimensional equations of substance (for the tracer) and heat budget is proposed. The solution to an inverse problem for turbulence coefficients and water exchange flows shows a considerable role of turbulence in the upper layers of deep-water column. The depth-dependent distribution function of sinking surface water parcels is found.																			0016-7886						2001	42	7					1127	1136																WOS:000171458300011

Outcrops of phreatomagmatic base surge deposits at the inner southern crater slope indicate that the lake is situated in a maar crater. The lake has a surface of 2.1 km(2) and a maximum depth of 126 m. Details to the morphometry are given. Groundwater inflow must be high. The lake is oligomictic and eutrophicated with a shallow epilimnion and a large anoxic hypolimnion. Mn, Fe, and TP have distinct peaks at the upper hypolimnion, probably caused by the groundwater inflow. Profundal sediments of Ranu Klindungan consist of carbonaceous diatom-gyttja and frequent turbidites. Often the fine layered sediments reveal a distinct cyclicity of layers of diatoms, carbonate and finally terrigenous material. Probably the diatom and carbonate layers represent the dry season (June-October), whereas the terrigenous layer is deposited by distal turbidites during the rain season (November-May). We interpret these cycles as varves. Despite tropical weathering, silt-sized minerals in terrigenous layers are mainly fresh feldspars, which points to rapid transport and embedding of these components. Thicker intraclast-turbidites may be associated with strong precipitation events during the rain season. The diatom record confirms this hypothesis: diatom layers are rich in complete valves of planktonic forms, whereas in the terrigenous layers few, mostly broken, valves of littoral species occur. The high proportion of turbidites contributes to the near-horizontal profundal lake bottom.					; Friese, Kurt/E-1395-2012	Witkowski, Andrzej/0000-0003-1714-218X; Boehrer, Bertram/0000-0001-6253-6634; Friese, Kurt/0000-0002-7769-0818													0065-6755						2001	16	3-4					487	516																WOS:000172677500015

This study evaluated seasonal influence on runoff water quality and compared urban runoff water quality with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) drinking water standards. Stormwater from sixteen playa lakes were evaluated for total and dissolved elements during a 32-month period Twenty elements were monitored to determine if concentrations posed a potential groundwater pollution problem. Eleven of the elements evaluated were temporally correlated with season of the year for both total and dissolved concentrations. Seasonal significances of the total and dissolved elemental concentrations were explained by natural or anthropogenic causes. The majority of the elements considered hazardous to human health, appeared in low concentrations in these urban stormwater fed lake waters during the study period. Concentrations of total and dissolved Al and Fe exceeded the U.S. EPA's secondary drinking water standards (cosmetic and aesthetic, not health). No significant health risk would seem to be posed by this urban storm water runoff percolating to groundwater.																			0022-4561	1941-3300					2001	56	3					263	266																WOS:000172938300019

Based on different greenhouse gas emission scenarios, five relatively independent global climate models are selected from 47 CMIP5 models to simulate future climatic conditions. Data are downscaled to the local projection, with bias neutralized before applying them to the hydrological models, by which availability of future water resources are calculated for the Dongting Lake basin. The results show that the water resources of the Dongting Lake basin are likely to increase in the future, but be distributed more unevenly. All scenarios indicate that water availability will increase during the flood season and decrease during the dry season, with a prominent increase in annual discharge. The scenarios also predict that the greater the greenhouse gas emissions, the more uneven the water distribution becomes. Overall, the water resources of the Dongting Lake catchment show the same increasing and unevenly distributed trend in the future, which could be further accelerated by human activities.					xiao, heng/NFS-4442-2025														0262-6667	2150-3435				AUG	2016	61	10					1791	1800		10.1080/02626667.2015.1051984	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2015.1051984													WOS:000380065500004

Relegation of L. laticaudata wolffi to the synonymy of L. crockeri is endorsed. Laticauda crockeri is restricted to a brackish lake in the interior of Rennell Island, Solomon Islands, where it is sympatric with a population of L. colubrina. Although both species occur together in many regions of the lake, Laticauda crockeri, unlike L. colubrina, was never seen on land. Consistent differences in diet were observed in a small sample of the two species.

Dynamic Neural Networks for Nonstationary Hydrological Time Series Modeling	PRACTICAL HYDROINFORMATICS: COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN WATER APPLICATIONS	Water Science and Technology Library				General Assembly of the European-Union-of-Geosciences	APR 24-29, 2005	Vienna, AUSTRIA	European Geosci Union				Evidence of nonstationary trends in hydrological time series, which result from natural and/or anthropogenic climatic variability and change, has raised a number of questions as to the adequacy of conventional statistical methods for long-term (seasonal to annual) hydrologic time series forecasting. Most conventional statistical methods that are used in hydrology will suffer from severe limitations as they assume a stationary time series. Advances in the application of artificial neural networks in hydrology provide new alternative methods for complex, nonstationary hydrological time series modeling and forecasting. An ensemble approach of competitive recurrent neural networks (RNN) is proposed for complex time-varying hydrologic system modeling. The proposed method automatically selects the most optimally trained RNN in each case. The model performance is evaluated on three well-known nonstationary hydrological time series, namely the historical storage volumes of the Great Salt Lake in Utah, the Saint-Lawrence River flows at Cornwall, and the Nile River flows at Aswan. In each modeling experiment, forecasting is performed up to 12 months ahead. The forecast performance of the proposed competitive RNN model is compared with the results obtained from optimal multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) models. It is shown that the competitive RNN model can be a good alternative for modeling the complex dynamics of a hydrological system, performing better than the MARS model, on the three selected hydrological time series data sets.																			0921-092X	1872-4663	978-3-540-79880-4				2008	68						71	+																WOS:000263646800006

The second part of the paper looks at chemical factors such as the concentrations of biogenic substances and chosen metals (Ca, Mg, Zn, Cu, Ni, Co, Mn, Cr, Cd and Pb) in water. The levels of microcystin-LR in the cells of cyanobacteria were negatively correlated only with the concentration of nitrates(V), total nitrogen and dissolved organic nitrogen. The ratio of total nitrogen to total phosphorus did not show any effect on cyanobacterial bloom yields or the efficiency of microcystin production. No effect was also found for the metals, probably because of their quite low concentrations in water in the season 2002.

Sampling was generally conducted twice a month and water samples were collected at 10 m intervals between 0 and 100 m depth and analyzed spectrophotometrically for dissolved inorganic nutrients. Physico-chemical parameters were determined during field work with specific probes, and further work was done in the laboratory for dissolved oxygen, which was measured using the Winkler method. Meteorological data allowed for the distinction of four contrasting seasonal situations: 1) September to December 2004 with low rainfall and decreasing wind speed, 2) December 2004 to April 2005 with low wind speed and high rainfall, 3) April to June 2005 with sporadic rainfall and slightly increasing wind speed, and 4) June to August 2005, a typical dry season with no rainfall and high wind speed. Low to high temperature stratification periods were recorded and seemed to be linked to the hydrodynamics of the lake. Below the mixed layer the water is generally anoxic, but in July a deepening of the oxygenated mixed layer down to the bottom was recorded. Within the photic zone, phytoplankton activity implied most of the year undetectable levels of nitrate and nitrite. However, strongly fluctuating and surprisingly high levels of ammonium and the lowest concentrations for silicates were observed. While ammonium accumulates in the dark anoxic waters, nitrate and nitrite peak levels are mostly observed between 30 and 70 m depth due to nitrification processes. Below the photic depth and down to the bottom, silicates increased due to biogenic silica dissolution. Our data mostly corroborate earlier works and confirm the strong coupling of meteorological data and water column properties in northern Lake Tanganyika.

The benefits of the existing 511 advisory service to seasoned users of the service and the potential additional benefit to providing travel-time estimates via the 511 service were evaluated. Data were provided by the Utah Department of Transportation. Four types of commuters were modeled: (a) a nonuser, who ignored traveler information; (b) a 511 advisory user, who made use of the 511 advisory service currently available to commuters in Salt Lake City; (c) a 511 travel-time user, who made use of a hypothetical 511 service that provided travel-time estimates; and (d) a dynamic message sign (DMS) user, who made use of DMS deployed along 20 mi of 1-15. Analysis showed that the existing 511 advisory service resulted in mobility and disutility-reduction benefits to seasoned commuters. Compared with the nonuser, the 511 advisory user was able to reduce peak-period late arrivals by 14%. By supplementing the existing 511 advisory service with DMS, late arrivals for current 511 advisory users can be further reduced by more than 10%. Providing travel times for the entire network over the 511 service can reduce peak-period late arrivals for current 511 advisory users by nearly 30%.																			0361-1981	2169-4052					2008		2086					64	71		10.3141/2086-08	http://dx.doi.org/10.3141/2086-08													WOS:000262797600008

In this study, a water budget analysis is presented for the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA) in South Florida for the period from 1973 to 1991. The EAA is a highly productive irrigation/drainage basin that has a high water table and organic soils. Water quality problems are associated with the drainage discharge from the basin. During dry periods, supplemental water is used for irrigation and in rainy periods excess water with relatively higher phosphorus content is pumped out of the basin to Lake Okeechobee and the Everglades ecosystem. Elevated concentrations of phosphorus in the runoff/drainage that is discharged from the EAA basin have created water quality problems. The mean surface water inflow to the basin was 63,990 ha-m, and the outflow was 131,447 ha-m per year. On the average, supplemental surface water use was 47,411 ha-m, and runoff/drainage was 114,816 ha-m per year. The mean annual basin rainfall was 120.9 cm. A general trend in the decline of the wet season rainfall is observed.																			0043-1370					MAY-JUN	1994	30	3					429	439																WOS:A1994NV62300007
J	MITTELBACH, GG				MITTELBACH, GG			OPTIMAL FORAGING AND GROWTH IN BLUEGILLS	OECOLOGIA												Two models of foraging behavior (optimal prey selection and random prey selection) were used to calculate the potential net energy intake of bluegill sunfish (L. macrochirus) in a small Michigan [USA] lake. These predictions were then compared to the actual growth exhibited by bluegills in the lake. Predictions of net energy gain derived from optimal foraging criteria were significantly correlated with the seasonal gain in mass by the fish; both energy gain and growth were positively related to bluegill length. Predictions of net energy intake based upon non-selective foraging (i.e., prey eaten as encountered) were not significantly correlated with bluegill growth. Comparing the net energy intake of bluegills feeding optimally vs. non-selectively demonstrates that optimal prey selection increases average energy gain by 4- to 10-fold. The strong evolutionary advantage afforded to foragers that maximizes net energy intake in a natural environment is illustrated. The potential usefulness of optimal foraging models to the study of species and/or size-class interactions is discussed and a heuristic example pertaining to the development of "stunted" populations in fishes is provided.

J	Maceina, MJ; Bayne, DR				Maceina, MJ; Bayne, DR			The potential impact of water reallocation on retention and chlorophyll a in Weiss Lake, Alabama	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Water supply demand has increased in North Georgia and prompted government officials to propose a water reallocation plan that would permit two reservoirs upstream from Weiss Lake, Alabama to increase water withdrawals nearly three fold. Hydrologic modeling predicted lower flows in the Coosa River, the primary tributary of Weiss Lake, during average to below average flows (exceedences from 50 to 90%). Consequently, we predicted retention (reservoir volume/discharge) would increase in Weiss Lake under reallocation and using data from 1989 to 2000 as a baseline, we estimated the effect of longer retention on chlorophyll a concentrations (CHLA) and water clarity. CHLA measured during the growing season (April to October) was positively correlated (P < 0.01) to retention in both upstream and downstream reservoir regions and retention accounted for 24 to 28% of the variation in CHLA in linear and non-linear regression models. Under the reallocation scheme, increased retention (as predicted by HEC-5) could potentially cause an increase in CHLA of 8 to 15% compared to historic conditions if CHLA increased linearly with retention. If retention should increase 10 days with water reallocation, we estimated CHLA could increase about 20 to 30% under a "worst-case scenario". Water reallocation would have little or no impact on water clarity as Secchi transparency did not increase with lower CHLA concentrations. If longer retention does occur in Weiss Lake with water reallocation, a greater frequency of hypereutrophic conditions is expected.																			1040-2381	2151-5530				SEP	2003	19	3					200	207		10.1080/07438140309354085	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438140309354085													WOS:000185811900002
J	BURKE, CM				BURKE, CM			BENTHIC MICROBIAL-PRODUCTION OF OXYGEN SUPERSATURATES THE BOTTOM WATER OF A STRATIFIED HYPERSALINE LAKE	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Lake Hayward is a hypersaline lake that stratifies seasonally and maintains oxygen supersaturation in its bottom water for about 6 months each year. This phenomenon was found to be the result of photosynthesis by the benthic microbial communities, composed primarily of the cyanobacteria Cyanothece spp., Spirulina sp., and Oscillatoria sp. When these communities were present and the lake was stratified, the bottom water was supersaturated with oxygen (up to 370%). During illumination, the benthic microbial communities rapidly developed very high concentrations (e.g., >500 mu M) of oxygen, which then diffused into the overlying water. However, while the overlying water became supersaturated, the concentration in the water was lower than in the benthic microbial communities because (1) transport across the sediment-water interface was limited by diffusion, and (2) turbulence rapidly mixed the oxygen throughout the much larger volume of the bottom water (approximately 1.5 m deep). Thus, import of oxygen by the benthic microbial communities at night proceeded more slowly than daytime export, allowing supersaturation of the bottom water to develop.																			0095-3628					MAR-APR	1995	29	2					163	171		10.1007/BF00167162	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00167162								24186721					WOS:A1995QH64200004

The absence of the intermediate morph semiarmatus and significant differences in a number of characters are indicative of reproductive isolation. The results show that the leiurus morph is common in the regions other than those with mild climate and small seasonal fluctuations of temperature.																			0378-1909	1573-5133				APR	1987	18	4					241	247		10.1007/BF00004877	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00004877													WOS:A1987H233300001
J	HECKY, RE; GUILDFORD, SJ				HECKY, RE; GUILDFORD, SJ			PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY OF SOUTHERN INDIAN LAKE BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER IMPOUNDMENT AND CHURCHILL RIVER DIVERSION	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												The primary productivity of 7 regions of Southern Indian Lake and neighboring Wood Lake was measured during open-water seasons from 1974-1978. The lake had regional differences in chlorophyll concentration and daily rates of integral primary production in 1974 and 1975 prior to impoundment of the lake. Regions receiving Churchill River flow tended to have higher chlorophyll concentrations and production rates than those regions marginal to the flow. Impoundment of the lake resulted in higher efficiencies of primary production in all regions, as indicated by higher light-saturated rates of C uptake per unit chlotophyll and by higher initial slopes of the hyprebolic light response relation to the phytoplankton. Many large basins of the lake had light penetration reduced by high concentrations of suspended sediment from eroding shorelines; other areas had relatively unchanged light penetration. The increased efficiency of C fixation per unit chlorophyll resulted in higher rates of integral production in those regions where light penetration was not greatly affected. Daily rates of integral primary production in lake regions where light penetration had decreased markedly were not significantly different after impoundment because efficiencies of light utilization were higher. Comparison of the mean water column light intensities for those turbid regions with the values of Ik (light intensity at the onset of light saturation) for phytoplankton indicated that these turbid regions are now light deficient on average. P deficiency, as indicated by alkaline phosphatase activity per unit ATP, which was present before impoundment, was eliminated as the mean water column light intensity declined below 5 mEinsteins .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. min-1. The light environment of a new reservoir can be a significant determinant of integral production, and predicting the consequences of impoundment on phytoplankton production requires accurate prediction of the light enviroment.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1984	41	4					591	604		10.1139/f84-072	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f84-072													WOS:A1984SU52800005

Mercury Concentrations in Eggs of Red-Winged Blackbirds and Tree Swallows Breeding in Voyageurs National Park, Minnesota	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												Most investigations of the environmental effects of mercury (Hg) have focused on aquatic food webs that include piscivorous fish or wildlife. However, recent investigations have shown that other species, including passerine songbirds, may also be at risk from exposure to methylmercury (MeHg). We quantified Hg concentrations in eggs of two species of songbirds, red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) and tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor), nesting in Voyageurs National Park, Minnesota, USA. Geometric mean concentrations of total Hg (THg) were lower in red-winged blackbird eggs [218 and 107 ng/g dry weight (dw) for 2012 and 2013, respectively] than in tree swallow eggs (228 and 300 ng/g dw for 2012 and 2013, respectively), presumably reflecting differences in the trophic positions of these two species. Concentrations of MeHg averaged 98.4 % of THg in red-winged blackbird eggs. Levels of THg observed in this study were well below critical toxicological benchmarks commonly applied to eggs of avian species, suggesting these breeding populations were not adversely affected by exposure to MeHg. In red-winged blackbirds, concentrations of THg in eggs collected in 2012 were twice those in eggs collected in 2013. Hg levels in eggs of both species increased with date of clutch initiation. In red-winged blackbirds, for example, temporal patterns showed that a 3-week delay in clutch initiation increased egg THg by 60 %. These observations indicate that in ovo exposure of wetland birds to MeHg can vary significantly within nesting season as well as between years.

When microbial uptake sites were saturated with DFAA, net primary amine removal rates were lower in light than in dark bottles, presumably due to release of DFAA by phytoplankton. Release rates ranged from 0.8 to 3.5 ng-atoms N liter-1h-1 in bottled lake water held several days at in situ temperatures. Ammonium accumulation rates in the dark ranged from >0.4 to 4nmol liter-1h-1. Ammonium regeneration was enhanced (up to 3-8 nmol liter-1h-1) by the addition of DFAA (0.94 .mu.M) to unfiltered lake water. On average, the increases in ammonium-N accumulation equaled losses of amino acid nitrogen from the same water samples [ratio = 1.01 (SE = 0.08, n = 29)]. This result suggests that Lake Michigan microheterotrophs may deaminate DFAA and not maintain the nitrogen in food-web biomass.

Stable oxygen and carbon isotopic compositions of Lates stappersii otoliths from Lake Tanganyika, East Africa	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												In this study, we measured growth trends in oxygen and carbon isotopic ratios in whole sagittal otoliths from three adult centropomid fish (Lates stappersii) from each of three sub-basins of Lake Tanganyika, East Africa. Sampling density was 20 to 50 samples per otolith. Both (delta O-18 and delta C-13 values increase with age. The 6180 data suggest that otoliths were precipitated near the expected equilibrium with the ambient environment (ca. +3.5 parts per thousand) and support a migration pattern from surface waters during larval stages to deeper waters (40 to 80 in) for mature fish. Relatively high (5180 values in the south ern sub-basin are consistent with cooler temperatures in the region during seasonal upwelling. The delta C-13 increase from otolith core to edge is large (up to 4 parts per thousand) and is interpreted as due to ontogenetic changes in diet and contributions from a decrease in the proportion of respired CO2 incorporated into otolith carbonate as metabolic rates of the fish dropped with maturity. The data seem to successfully reveal life strategy and migration patterns of L. stappersii, document regional differences in lake conditions, and provide a record of temperature within the water column during which the fish lived. Higher resolution studies and analyses of historical samples could be used to constrain modern and past growth patterns, and to reconstruct past temperature gradients and productivity patterns in the lake.

J	MARTIN, TJ; CYRUS, DP				MARTIN, TJ; CYRUS, DP			ZOOPLANKTON IN THE OPEN WATER AREAS OF LAKE CUBHU, A FRESH-WATER COASTAL LAKE IN ZULULAND, SOUTH-AFRICA	WATER SA												A preliminary investigation of the zooplankton in the open water areas of Lake Cubhu, a shallow, freshwater coastal lake near Richards Bay was conducted on a monthly basis during 1988. Species densities and species richness in the lake were low. The zooplankton community comprised 15 taxa which were numerically dominated by 2 species of cyclopoid copepods, Paracyclops poppei and Microcyclops crassipes, throughout the year. Other than some minor fluctuations in densities between the 2 major cyclopoids species, no significant changes were evident in the community structure, numerical abundance or seasonal densities of the different species between sampling stations. Lake Cubhu follows a similar pattern to many other African subtropical and tropical coastal lakes in having very limited production. Chlorophyll alpha values measured over a 2-year period seldom exceeded 4.mug-1. The main factor limiting zooplankton numbers in the lake is a low primary productivity which can be related to clear, shallow water and a restricted nutrient input.																			0378-4738					APR	1994	20	2					107	112																WOS:A1994NV62400002

Despite the relatively high concentration (up to 0.45 mu mol l(-1)) of soluble nonreactive phosphorus (SNP) in the reservoir and the high total PMEase activity (up to 1144 nmol pNP l(-1) h(-1)), the rate of phosphate release from SNP accounted for less than 0.6% of the direct orthophosphate uptake by the planktonic community. The high apparent affinity and maximum velocity for pNPP may underestimate the velocities of Pi release by PMEase. More critical studies using natural substrates are needed to assess the role of PMEase as Pi supplier for the planktonic community. PMEase activity was apparently not related to soluble or particulate phosphorus fractions, suggesting that PMEase activity may not be useful as an indicator of P-limitation, unless other phosphorus pools (e.g. intracellular phosphorus) are considered.

Polar ordination indicated that the crustacean plankton community structure was closely related to the first (turbidity) axis. Mean body size was also positively related to turbidity, suggesting that reduced transparency in turbid waters might protect large zooplankters from visually seeking fish predators. Mysis relicta and Leptodora kindtii, the two largest species, were most abundant at the lake''s turbid (northern) end with declining numbers toward the clear (southern) end. Many smaller copepods and cladocerans showed reduced numbers at the northern stations during the turbidity maximum in early June, possibly because of impaired feeding ability, after which they progressively increased through the season relative to numbers in the south. Daphnia galeata mendotae failed to show this seasonal increase at the turbid end, possibly because of selective cropping by Mysis and Leptodora. Many species displayed somewhat higher midday vertical distributions in turbid than in clear waters.

Orconectes virilis growth rates at ELA are only 27-38% of those reported for other areas. Growth varied both among study lakes and between years. Higher temperatures and a longer growing season during 1980 increased growth an average of 12% over that of the preceding year. Crayfish growth and maximum size in 4-6 lakes were significantly correlated with phytoplankton production and chlorophyll a concentration. Growth regulated both the number of age I animals attaining sexual maturity and the per capita egg production, and was also directly related to the proportion of mature females that were fertilized. Population regulation is mediated through alterations in reproductive capacity that is correlated with system productivity.						france, robert/0000-0002-9171-8426													0706-652X	1205-7533					1985	42	6					1096	1102		10.1139/f85-136	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f85-136													WOS:A1985ALP7900005

The lakes were primarily fed by ground-water but the increases in available moisture resulted from northward shifts of the monsoonal belt ; local rainfall increased to about 600 mm per annum. The period as a whole apparently corresponds to the later part of the Penultimate Glaciation and to the Last Interglacial. The absolute dates, based on a variety of new techniques, suggest a duration for the Middle Palaeolithic lacustrine episodes from about 160,000 to about 70,000 years ago. There is a large number of open-air, Middle Palaeolithic sites associated with deposits of the ancient lakes, most of them with only one or a few occupations, but one with more than 2 m of cultural deposits and an extensive associated fauna. On the basis of the artifacts, most of the sites can be assigned to a Denticulate Aterian. The Middle Palaeolithic occupants of the area made use of a consistent, seasonally repetitive, semi-specialized settlement system, as part of a diverse and complex, economic strategy. There is however, no indication of true task-specialization, such as is known for later periods of prehistory.

In the ayu population of Lake Biwa it is known that the survival rate in the early life history depends on the population density. Adopting the population size at the beginning of February as the recruitment size, we theoretically derived a general relationship between the recruitment size and the mean number of juveniles caught by a net survey in December. We then calculated the recruitment size that satisfied the derived relation as closely as possible, using a cohort analysis. We found that the obtained relation can give a practical estimate of the recruitment size from the mean number of juveniles caught in December.																			0919-9268					FEB	1996	62	1					15	20		10.2331/fishsci.62.15	http://dx.doi.org/10.2331/fishsci.62.15													WOS:A1996UE65100003

Distinct differences were detected in band number, pattern, and density of DGGE at different sampling sites and time points.

Patterns in diet overlap demonstrated with pooled sample methodology could not always be matched with a random individual pairing technique. With the pooled methodologies, we demonstrated a diet composition shift with significant changes in diet diversity and evenness in the Peter Lake bass after the introduction of trout: such bass ate fewer zooplankton (Daphnia spp.) and more odonate naiads than before trout introduction, and their condition factor was reduced. Seasonal divergence in diets between bass and trout was observed. Growth rates of Paul Lake bass did not differ significantly between years, and relative to the experimental lake there were fewer statistically significant dietary differences.																			0706-652X					SEP	1991	48	9					1704	1712		10.1139/f91-202	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f91-202													WOS:A1991GH59400013

J	ALLAN, JD				ALLAN, JD			LIFE-HISTORY PATTERNS IN ZOOPLANKTON	AMERICAN NATURALIST												Freshwater zooplankton exhibit a continuum of compromises in their means of meeting the presumably conflicting demands of maximizing the potential for rapid increase, predator avoidance and competitive ability. Rotifers and cladocerans both alternate parthenogenetic and sexual reproduction and attain high rates of increase relative to copepods. The rapidly developing small-clutch rotifers surpass more slowly developing large-clutch cladocerans in rmax. Copepods appear to consume food in a wider range of particle sizes, exhibit a greater capacity for selective feeding and possess a greater ability in predator avoidance. The ranking of the 3 major taxa of freshwater zooplankton with respect to opportunism is: rotifers > cladocerans > copepods. These results are utilized to interpret some principal biogeographic trends in plankton composition, including the rarity or nearly complete absence of rotifers and cladocerans from the open oceans and deeper waters of large lakes. Patterns in the timing and sharpness of seasonal abundance peaks are also consistent with this interpretation, although complexities in timing occur owing to intrataxon variation in keying to seasonal fluctuations.

The diatoms ingested by adult Goniobasis proxima, juvenile Leptoxis carinata, and adult Physa sp. co-occurring in this habitat were indistinguishable from one another, in spite of great differences in radular morphology. All snails sampled the diatom flora almost randomly, with only one or two of the larger diatom species under-represented in the gut contents. Some snails also seemed to selectively ingest the smaller individuals of the larger diatom taxa, and larger individuals of the smaller diatom taxa. The diatoms identifiable in juvenile Goniobasis guts were somewhat more distinctive, although this seemed to be due at least partly to more mechanical breakage. The diatom flora of quiet, muddy pools was much different from that of shallow, rocky areas, but once again, Goniobasis seemed to sample the available flora randomly. Seasonal variation was also apparent in the diatom diet of Goniobasis. We suggest that in some cases, it may be reasonable to use snails to sample the diatom assemblage present in a particular habitat, if more direct methods are impractical.																			0018-8158					MAR 8	1991	210	3					233	242		10.1007/BF00034682	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00034682													WOS:A1991FF63700009
J	VINCENT, WF; VINCENT, CL				VINCENT, WF; VINCENT, CL			FACTORS CONTROLLING PHYTOPLANKTON PRODUCTION IN LAKE VANDA (77-DEGREES-S)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												At least 3 floristically distinct communities of algae were distributed down the permanently ice-capped water column of Lake Vanda [Antarctica]. Phytoplankton at each depth were highly specialized towards specific conditions of light and temperature. Maximum photosynthesis and algal biomass was at the bottom of the euphotic zone (55-57.5 m) immediately above a region of nutrient-rich anoxic water. This Phormidium-dominated community was adapted towards warm temperatures (18.degree.-20.degree. C) but a dim light regime. Dissolved inorganic N to P ratios in this region were extreme (> 5000:1) and the plankton demonstrated strong cellular P deficiency. A much smaller photosynthetic maximum was recorded in the middle of a large thermohaline convection cell at 25-30 m where P deficiency was less severe; but detectable. A microflagellate community immediately under the ice demonstrated the least response to phosphorus enrichment, but photosynthetic characteristics appeared to be more attuned to the low irradiances which prevail early in the growing season rather than to the relatively bright light regime during midsummer sampling. Algal biomass levels at most depths declined over 4 wk of sampling, further indicating that population maxima are timed early in the season. The low input of phosphorus relative to nitrogen exerts an overall control on phytoplankton biomass in Lake Vanda, but low production rates per unit biomass characterize the shade-adapted populations at all depths.

J	SMITH, VH				SMITH, VH			NUTRIENT DEPENDENCE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY IN LAKES	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												An analysis of growing season measurements of daily primary productivity, chlorophyll, water chemistry and transparency from 58 north temperate lakes [USA] shows a strong correlation between volumetric rates of photosynthesis, chlorophyll and nutrients. Mean daily rates of photosynthesis per unit volume euphotic zone, .hivin.v, are correlated with mean chlorophyll concentration (r2 = 0.80). The mean daily rate of photosynthesis at optimal depth, .hivin.Aopt, is highly correlated with mean total P(r2 = 0.95), and with mean total N(r2 = 0.91). In contrast, integral rates of photosynthesis are linked less tightly to nutrient concentration because of their simultaneous dependence on transparency. The Dillon-Rigler P loading model is extended to predict volumetric rates of photosynthesis (.hivin.v and .hivin.Aopt) in lakes where the N:P balance indicates control by P (N:P .gtoreq. 13).																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1979	24	6					1051	1064		10.4319/lo.1979.24.6.1051	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1979.24.6.1051													WOS:A1979HV52800006

Photolysis was negligible in sterilized water, with and without natural photosensitizers. In 1:10 sediment:water systems, 50% disappearance times of 0.5-2 weeks were observed in the metabolism studies (25-degrees-C). Major metabolites (>10%) included the dichloropyridinol and 3-chloropyridinol derivatives, while the 5-chloropyridinol derivative appeared (<7%) in anaerobic systems. The pyridinols disappeared readily in aerobic but more slowly in anaerobic systems. In typical pond and lake waters, fluroxypyr and pyridinols are expected to disappear by the end of the growing season.																			0043-1737					JUN	1993	33	3					197	204		10.1111/j.1365-3180.1993.tb01933.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3180.1993.tb01933.x													WOS:A1993LD24600001

After the emergence of Equisetum fluviatile L. shoots in mid June, water exchange between the littoral and pelagial area diminished and phosphorus concentrations in water and in surface sediment increased in the inner and mid littoral zones. Phosphorus pool in flocculent, 'easily resuspensible' sediment composed on average 62% of inorganic phosphorus and 38% of organic phosphorus. 63% of the inorganic phosphorus, on the average, was extracted from 'apatite-P fraction'; 29% from 'iron-P fraction'; 7% from 'aluminum-P fraction'; and less than 1% from 'loosely-bound P fraction'. During the growing season, net accumulation of sediment and phosphorus was measured only in the inner littoral zone whereas the outer littoral zones acted rather as a source of phosphorus for the pelagic area. The results of this study indicated that nutrient dynamics in littoral environment was through changes in flow environment greatly governed by the macrophytes.																			0018-8158					FEB 25	1994	275						285	292		10.1007/BF00026719	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00026719													WOS:A1994NB19800026
J	AMAT, JA				AMAT, JA			PARENT-OFFSPRING FEEDING RELATIONSHIP OF COOTS (FULICA-ATRA) IN A VARYING ENVIRONMENT	BEHAVIOUR												Predictions derived from parental investment theory indicate that when the reproductive value of offspring decreases, parental investment should also decrease. If so, it should be expected that in adverse years, parental investment should be lower, given the lower survival prospects of chicks, than in more favourable years. I tested this by recording the Frequency with which coots (Fulica atra) fed their chicks during a ten tears period in a set of lakes that experienced considerable interannual variations in water levels. Contrary to the prediction, I found that during drier years, chicks were Fed more frequently than during wetter years, in which self-feeding by chicks was more frequent. The reason for this could he that for coots the crucial factor For improving reproductive success is the quality rather than the quantity of chicks. and by increasing parental effort during more adverse years, the lower survival prospects of chicks could be attenuated. However, late in the breeding season, when fledging success is lower, chicks were fed by their parents less frequently than in the early breeding season. This could be related to a change in the cost/benefit ratio, itself independent of offspring quality, that parents experience when rearing chicks late in the season due to the start of plumage moult.

Two trematode parasites; Diplostomum phoxini, in their brains, and Mncrolecithus papilliger, in their guts, were found. The prevalence of D. phoxini was 100% in both years. The mean abundance was 231 in 1990 and 448 in 1991; the difference was significant. Prevalence (and abundance) of M. papilliger was 37.5% (1.04+/-0.39) in 1990 and 59.5% (2.68+/-0.55) in 1991; also significantly higher in 1991 than in 1990. No differences in prevalence or abundance between males and females were found. Numbers of both parasites were significantly correlated with fish length. There was seasonal variation in the abundance of D. phoxini metacercariae, with a peak in June/July in both years. The prevalence of M. papiller decreased after July in both years. Distribution of the two trematodes was overdispersed as indicated by the variance to mean (abundance) ratio. The observed seasonal variation in D. phoxini abundance also suggests that sublethal parasites could influence the population dynamics of their hosts.																			1015-1621	1420-9055					1995	57	2					119	126		10.1007/BF00877380	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00877380													WOS:A1995RK31100003
J	PITHART, D; PECHAR, L				PITHART, D; PECHAR, L			THE STRATIFICATION OF POOLS IN THE ALLUVIUM OF THE RIVER LUZNICE	INTERNATIONALE REVUE DER GESAMTEN HYDROBIOLOGIE												The stratification of two shallow and small pools, situated in a floodplain ecosystem, was investigated. A new methodological approach was applied. The parameter called summarized chemical and biological stratification (SCB), was derived from basic limnological parameters in order to evaluate the global intensity of chemical and biological stratification and to compare it with a thermal one. Three situations were described when the seasonal courses of thermal and SCB stratification were compared: 1. Both SCB and thermal stratification are present. 2. The water column is homogeneous there is no stratification in the pool. 3. SCB stratification is present, but the water is homoiothermic. The thermal stratification is very unstable because of the small volume of the pools and frequent floods. The SCB stratification is of higher stability and it may persist in a homoiothermic water column. In comparison with temperate deep lakes, the thermal stratification does not play such an important role in initiating the chemical and biological stratification. The surface/volume ratio and the depth in the pools are lower, which cause the ''bottom-initiates'' quick renovation of stratification even in homoiothermic water. The differences in oxygen regime, volume and localization of bath investigated pools cause the differences in stratification patterns. Frequent oxygen depletions in one of the pools increase the intensity of stratification and influence its character. The anaerobic conditions lead to steeper gradients of basic nutrients, pH, alkalinity and water color. The occurrence of a unique phytoplankton community (Cryptophyceae) is probably closely related to the described stratification patterns.																			0020-9309						1995	80	1					61	75		10.1002/iroh.19950800108	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19950800108													WOS:A1995RA74400005

Breeding in this stream began earlier, at lower temperatures, and continued longer than in other documented lake-breeding populations. These responses were related to flooding which repeatedly thwarted breeding attempts. Nesting and spawning continued asynchronously throughout the seasons, increasing breeding opportunities. Older, larger males spawned earliest in the season, allowing them increased renesting opportunities. The duration of each stage in nesting and brood development was documented. Nests were generally largely than those of other rock bass populations. Male size and nest size were positively related. Nests were elliptical rather than circular as in lakes, reflecting the influence of water flow. Males demonstrated nest-site selection: individual nest sites were allocated nonrandomly with respect to depth, reflecting the availability of appropriate nesting substrates, and the majority of nests were constructed downstream from obstructions to current. Many of these features of rock bass reproduction can be interpreted as being responses to the relatively variable and rigorous environment of the stream habitat as compared with lakes.																			0008-4301	1480-3283				FEB	1987	65	2					379	390		10.1139/z87-059	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z87-059													WOS:A1987G472400025

A total of 2175 adult sticklebacks were collected from 10 trap sites located at depths ranging from 0.25 to 5 m. These samples were assayed for length, weight, sex, state of maturity and egg number (when applicable). The number and weight of the plerocercoids of a cestode tapeworm (S. solidus) often found in the abdominal cavities of sticklebacks were recorded. The purpose of the study was to document the effects of Schistocephalus on reproduction in Gasterosteus. Stickleback spawning reached a peak in June and declined sharply through July and Aug. Over the entire breeding season, < 5% of the gravid females were infected with Schistocephalus, whereas > 40% of the sexually mature but nongravid females were infected. There was no difference between breeding and nonbreeding males in the prevalence of Schistocephalus. In both sexes, the prevalence and severity of Schistocephalus infection were low in May, June and July but increased sharply through Aug. and Sept. Since the majority of Fuller Lake sticklebacks live for 1 yr, the major adverse effects of Schistocephalus were confined to postreductive adults.

Diffusion from sediment porewater to overlying water in laboratory microcosms	COLLOIDS AND SURFACES A-PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING ASPECTS												The diffusion of colloidal organic carbon from the porewater of a local sediment (University Lake, Baton Rouge, LA) was studied in laboratory microcosms. The effects of porewater ionic strength on the flux of dissolved organic carbon (DOG) was studied using two different electrolytes, namely NaCl and CaCl2. The sediment porewater DOC concentration profiles were used to obtain the effective diffusivities (D-e) in the sediment. The values of D-e (0.019 and 0.021 cm(2)d(-1)) obtained for the sediment sample used in this work indicated low colloid mobility in porewaters. The D, values increased slightly in the presence of electrolytes in the porewaters (0.030 cm(2) d(-1) for 1 M CaCl2 and 0.023 cm(2) d(-1) for 0.5 M NaCl). The porewater concentration of colloidal DOC was consistently low in the presence of electrolytes, indicating larger adsorption to the sediment solids. The D-e values were found to range from 0.019 to 0.103 cm(2) d(-1) for sediments collected from different regions and during different seasons. The effect of ionic strength on the depletion of a hydrophobic organic contaminant (namely pyrene) from the sediment by diffusion was found to be minimal under the conditions of these experiments.

The seasonal distribution of 6 dominant cyst types obtained from two years of sediment trapping in Lake Cerne, another strongly acid softwater fake in Bohemia, was used to define the varves. Additionally, 8 scaled chrysophyte taxa were observed in the sediment trap data. A total of 45 cyst types were identified in the sediment core. Most (96%) cyst types were represented in the calibration set and used to infer the pH-values for each varve. Over the period 1987 - 1990, the inferred pH-values were in good agreement with the measured pH-values.																					3-443-51036-1				1996							219	231																WOS:A1996BJ57Z00016

With a decrease of pH the number of phytoplankton species decreased especially among centric diatoms,blue-greens and Euglenophyta, total biomass of phytoplankton and its seasonal dispersion declined. Green algae, chrysomonades and cryptomonades biomass correlated negatively with pH but diatoms and blue-greens biomass were related positively to pH. The drop in pH produced a decrease of Shannon-Weaver diversity index, obtained from biomass and cell volume of algae, increase of Simpson index and algae size. The growth of phytoplankton did not correspond the total phosphorus. The necessary modifications to the structural characteristics of phytoplankton by the acidification came about in the pH range from 6 to 5.

A normalised PCA was used to analyse the spatio-temporal distribution of 18 rotifer species. They are more numerous in the littoral zone, but seasonal changes remain higher than spatial changes. Results illustrate the capability of rotifers to take efficiently advantage of available space and food. The digestive tracts of fry and juvenile roach was also analysed and the index of Ivlev was used to determine prey selection. Fish predation occurs in the nearshore zone and the interactions between invertebrate predators and their prey are illustrated by the quantitative changes in community dynamics. Among the complex cascade of events varying in the course of the year, and despite of resource partitioning, predator-prey interactions as well as the exploitative competition between rotifers and crustaceans produce gradients exhibited in the horizontal distribution of rotifers in Lake Aydat.																			1015-1621						1996	58	3					253	268		10.1007/BF00877512	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00877512													WOS:A1996VX59700005
J	Whitfield, AK				Whitfield, AK			A review of estuarine ichthyology in South Africa over the past 50 years	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF SOUTH AFRICA												Progress in South African estuarine ichthyology between 1946 and 1995 is reviewed. The early estuary surveys of the 1950s and 1960s resulted in the compilation of species lists for individual systems, but contained very little biological or ecological information on fishes. These surveys were superseded by both autecological and synecological studies in the 1970s and 1980s, which yielded descriptive and process-orientated information on a wide variety of species. Estuarine research during the 1990s has focused increasingly at the community level, with several review papers on the life-history styles of groups of estuarine-associated fishes being published. The last decade has also seen the departure of a number of senior estuarine ichthyologists from the field. This decline in available expertise has coincided with increased demand for ichthyological information to be used in decision support systems for the wise management and conservation of estuaries. It is suggested that these demands be seen as a challenge, with studies being directed towards providing the type of information needed for the maintenance of vital ecological processes within these systems.

A lacustrine basin with variable salinity was formed in the graben. In the southern part of this basin a large fan-delta developed, extending northward along the graben axis. Microbial ecosystems settled on the fringe of the lake. In the paludal zone, they formed carbonate encrustations on living plants or detrital vegetal remains. Littoral carbonate facies occur as algal bioherms an stromatolitic reefs. In the distal lacustrine zone, a discrete nodular texture within the sediment reveals the microbial origin of micrite and gives the limestone a breccial pattern. All these facies illustrate the lateral zonation of the different types of constrictions from fluvio-deltaic to lacustrine. In certain cases, the microbial coating on plants permits to reconstruct seasonal rhythms and the processes of substratum colonisation.																			0031-0182					FEB 15	1994	107	1-2					35	47		10.1016/0031-0182(94)90163-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0031-0182(94)90163-5													WOS:A1994NA95700002

E. Norway, was 0.29%. The crayfish population is heavily exploited. Thelohania contejeani infection levels increased significantly during the fishing season, and variations between years were more pronounced in catches after the fishing season (0.38-2.11%) compared to catches before the fishing season (0.05-0.19%). Sixty-eight per cent of the variation between years could be explained from variations in trap effort. Scuba-diving yielded significantly higher T. contejeani infection levels than simultaneous trapping with baited traps. Thus, in years with heavy exploitation, a larger fraction of non-infected crayfish are removed from the population as these are more susceptible to capture. The findings do not support the hypothesis that density and cannibalism influence of T. contejeani infection.					; Fjeld, Eirik/K-9241-2013	Fjeld, Eirik/0000-0003-0137-6918; 													0140-7775	1365-2761				SEP	1990	13	5					411	415		10.1111/j.1365-2761.1990.tb00800.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2761.1990.tb00800.x													WOS:A1990ED50100009

At Lake Boga, in northern Victoria, atmospheric basking occurred throughout the year but was uncommon outside the normal season of activity (October-April). Frequency of atmospheric basking was significantly positively correlated with operative environmental temperature (Te). Deep-body temperature (Tb) of atmospheric basking turtles (maximum 34.2 C) was nearly always below coincident Te and above coincident water surface temperature. Aquatic basking occurred during the normal activity season when the lake was thermally stratified. Associated Tb (maximum 29.6 C) did not exceed coincident water surface temperature by more than 0.1 C. Head temperature (Tb) was significantly higher than Tb during both atmospheric and aquatic basking. In individual turtles, Tb - Tb ranged from - 4.8 to + 3.2 C during atmospheric basking (mean + 0.7 C) and from -1.2 to +2.8 C during aquatic basking (mean + 0.8 C). Aquatic basking provides similar thermoregulatory benefits to atmospheric basking, and may be less costly in terms of risk of predation and loss of foraging time.

J	COLWELL, MA; ORING, LW				COLWELL, MA; ORING, LW			BREEDING BIOLOGY OF WILSON PHALAROPE IN SOUTHCENTRAL SASKATCHEWAN	WILSON BULLETIN												The breeding biology of Wilson''s Phalarope (Phalaropus tricolor), a sex-role reversed shorebird, was studied from 1982-1987 at Last Mountain Lake National Wildlife Area in southcentral Saskatchewan, Canada. Female mating tactics involved direct competition for mates, rather than competition via territories. Unpaired, competing females ranged more widely than paired or laying females. By contrast, males were more restricted in their movements, particularly during incubation and brooding periods. Modal clutch size was four; and clutches weighted an average of 55% of the body weight of a nonlaying female. Females laid 0-4 clutches in a breeding season. Male reproductive patterns were characterized by nearly exclusive care of eggs and chicks. Weight of incubating males decreased during incubation. Nesting success varied significantly among years, primarily owing to the effects of predation. Approximately 25% of males that lost clutches during the nesting season renested. Among the three species of phalaropes, ecological factors favor higher incidences of polyandry in Wilson''s Phalarope, but estimates may be complicated by wide-ranging movements of females during the breeding season.																			0043-5643					DEC	1988	100	4					567	582																WOS:A1988R494000005

The lakes vary from the circumneutral (pH 6-7) to the acid (minimum pH almost-equal-to 4.5). These lakes were chosen as objects for an integrated limnological monitoring - a project started in 1988. On the basis of their phytoplankton species and biomasses, the lakes are classified with the TWINSPAN technique in five different groups, two being circumneutral, three being acid. A total of three groups contain brown-water lakes. Among the 36 most important green algal taxa, especially the chlorococcal species Oocystis submarina v. variabilis seems to withstand a very harsh environment (pH 4.5 and deep mixing) while planktonic desmids (Staurastrum, Staurodesmus, Closterium) disappear in a pH below 5.5 even though desmids are characterized as an acid-tolerant group. The best separating environmental variables for green algae in the lakes investigated here are pH, mixing depth and the content of humic matter. Two-dimensional niches are presented for some species with contrasting occurrence and main environmental variables governing the seasonal development of the green algae are also outlined by use of a CANOCO ordination.																			0003-9365					FEB	1992	141	1-2					47	64		10.1016/S0003-9365(11)80048-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0003-9365(11)80048-5													WOS:A1992HK81100005
J	BYRON, ER				BYRON, ER			THE ADAPTIVE SIGNIFICANCE OF CALANOID COPEPOD PIGMENTATION - A COMPARATIVE AND EXPERIMENTAL-ANALYSIS	ECOLOGY												A two part study was undertaken to investigate the adaptive value of carotenoid pigmentation to calanoid copepods and the costs in terms of visually selective predation. A comparative survey of copepod populations documented the distribution of pigmented forms and suggested the importance of water temperature, lake depth and elevation to copepod pigmentation. Estimates of photodamaging irradiance and yearly temperature regime were constructed from the primary survey variables and compared for their correlation with copepod pigmentation. Yearly temperature regime is directly related to elevation and is most important in explaining variation in copepod pigmentation. Copepods are most darkly pigmented in the coldest lakes. Phytoplankton pigment concentration is not limiting to the pigmentation of calanoid copepods. Carotenoid pigments can be photoprotective to calanoid copepods exposed to strong sunlight, yet field experiments failed to demonstrate photodamage when copepods were allowed to migrate vertically in enclosures. Respirometry experiments have shown that pigmented copepods respire faster in the light than in the dark, while unpigmented copepods do not. This metabolic facilitation by light helps to explain literature accounts of the sunlight-related behavior of pigmented zooplankton. Laboratory and field experiments with predators confirmed that vertebrate predators select pigmented calanoid copepods, but that common invertebrate predators are not visually selective. Trout are highly visually selective predators. Although salamanders are visually selective in laboratory enclosures, they are inefficient at capturing calanoid copepods in nature. Pigments are adaptive to calanoid copepods because they facilitate a metabolic increase and provide photoprotection when the animals are illuminated. Pigments are rarely found in the zooplankton, however, because zooplankton are continuously exposed to predation by visually selective predators. In cold environments with short growing seasons, as at high elevations, the advantages of pigmentation at least partially outweigh the costs in terms of selective predation, thus shifting the balance in favor of pigmentation.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1982	63	6					1871	1886		10.2307/1940127	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1940127													WOS:A1982PS51900027
J	FEE, EJ				FEE, EJ			RELATION BETWEEN LAKE MORPHOMETRY AND PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY AND ITS USE IN INTERPRETING WHOLE-LAKE EUTROPHICATION EXPERIMENTS	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Rates of primary production during the ice-free season expressed per unit volume of epilimnion were linearly related to the ratio of epilimnion sediment area to epilimnion volume in unfertilized lakes in the Experimental Lakes Area (ELA), northwestern Ontario [Canada]. This ratio is mathematically equivalent to the probability of retention of sedimenting particles in the epilimnion of a lake divided by the mean depth of the epilimnion and is a measure of the nutrient recycling rate of a lake. Epilimnetic nutrient recycling in ELA lakes evidently is dominated by processes occurring at the sediment-water interface and not within the sediment. The relationship between the ratio of sediment area to epilimnion volume and primary production is used as the basis for interpreting whole-lake eutrophication experiments. In comparison to control lakes, the ratio of production to chlorophyll in the experimental lakes was high when chlorophytes dominated and low when cyanophytes dominated. Lakes that were fertilized with both N and P had much higher chlorophyll concentrations and productivities than control lakes. Lakes that received either of these nutrients alone showed weaker responses. Both elements appear to be in short supply relative to the metabolic requirements of phytoplankton. P control is still the key by controlling eutrophication.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1979	24	3					401	416		10.4319/lo.1979.24.3.0401	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1979.24.3.0401													WOS:A1979GY59000001

Subsequently further populations have been discovered in two dredged groundwater ponds in Styria and Carinthia (Austria). Its morphology and infraciliature were studied in live cells and in specimens impregnated with protargol. Histiobalantium bodamicum measures 40-60 x 35-45 mu m, has usually a long-ellipsoid macronucleus, accompanied by several globular to lenticular micronuclei, and three contractile vacuoles. Somatic ciliation is interspersed with long tactile cilia. The huge buccal cavity contains a prominent, roughly inverted 3-shaped paroral kinety and three adoral membranelles M1, M2, M3 arranged closely and in parallel at the paroral's anterior end. The posterior segment of the paroral kinety is accompanied in close distance by a single-filed kinety (scutico-vestige). The adoral membranelles and the paroral kinety form an obtuse angle. Membranelle 3 is composed of a single row of monokinetids. Abundance, seasonal population dynamics and vertical distribution of H. bodamicum in two Austrian dredged groundwater ponds and in Lake Constance are described. A synopsis of morphological and ecological data of the presently known species of the family Histiobalantiidae is compiled.																			0932-4739					DEC 15	1995	31	4					389	395		10.1016/S0932-4739(11)80451-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0932-4739(11)80451-7													WOS:A1995TU00900004

Thermal stratification and P limitation occurred faster in the central than in the eastern basin and the plankton remained P limited throughout most of the stratified season. This condition relaxed as the thermocline deepened in the central basin, exposing the epilimnion to a greater area of sediments. In Sept., when mixing ofthe entire water column occurred, the plankton were no longer P limited. In contrast, as the thermocline deepened in the eastern basin, metalimnetic water was entrained but the plankton remained P limited until mid-Oct. A reduction of P in Lake Erie would probably affect the phytoplankton biomass during the periods of P limitation.																			0380-1330						1983	9	1					83	91		10.1016/S0380-1330(83)71875-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(83)71875-7													WOS:A1983QG13100012

In order to understand better the mode of complexation and transport of trace elements in this environment, a geochemical survey was undertaken of the waters of the area, both in surface streams and at the water table. The concentration of the main cations decreases from the top of the slope down towards the lake. This is especially true during the rainy season and could be related to a more active leaching in this period. The chondrite-normalized REE pattern in the soil sequence is very similar to the pattern found for the local bedrock and is characterized by a depletion in heavy REE (HREE). For the groundwaters, the REE abundance normalized to average REE values of soils shows an enrichment in HREE as well as downslope, near the lake, and in the upper part of the sequence. At the outlet of the lake, the water of the stream has an alkaline pH and high values for numerous elements, contrasting with the low contents in the water table and in the lake. Thus it seems that the water of the outlet could be at least partly related to an apatite rich and carbonatitic formation, more abundant in this area. This is confirmed by positive Sm and Eu anomalies. Waters were also collected in 2 types of lysimeters. The cylindrical collectors gave higher REE contents than the plate collectors, a feature that might result from adsorption by the metabolic activity at the rhyzosphere. The geochemical data acquired in the groundwaters, in the lake and at the outlet of the Lagoa Campestre allow a better understanding of the dynamics of the basin. During the rainy season, leaching is active on the slopes; it enhances dissolution of residual minerals in the latosolic cover and induces mobilization of relatively high quantities of REE in the groundwaters. The stream at the outlet is probably mainly fed by deeper waters circulating through apatite rich rocks, except during the rainy season when the lake also partly contributes to its supply. This means that most of the material leached on the slopes of the basin accumulates in the central part of the depression. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Cavuscu lake has a surface area of 1000 ha with a maximum depth of 4 m and is classified as an oligo-mesotrophic lake. Eber lake has a surface area of 5200...17000 ha with a maximum depth of 2.5 m and is classified as an eutrophic lake.

The study sites were matched in terms of physiography soils, stand history, and vegetative characteristics. Measurements of basal area and biomass growth were made for the 1988-1991 growing seasons. There were no significant differences in either basal area or biomass increment among the four sites over the 4 year period. There was a great deal of year-to-year variability with relative basal area growth rates ranging from as low as 0.2% to as high as 2.4% on a single site in successive years. Growth efficiency measures reflected this variability with as much as an 800% difference between successive years on a single site. When coupled with year-to-year variability of up to 34% in leaf area related to heavy seed years and defoliation, this indicates that growth efficiency and leaf area measures are not consistent indicators of aboveground productivity for tolerant deciduous species, especially if derived from short-term measurements or temporary plots.

Response of round gobies (Apollonia melanostomus) to fibreglass models of conspecifics	ETHOLOGY ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION												The round goby (Apollonia, formerly Neogobius, melanostomus) is an invasive fish that is currently a threat to the biodiversity of the Great Lakes. Mature individuals can vary in size from 70 mm to over 200 rum total length, and some males adopt black body coloration during the reproductive season. These variable characteristics as well as others suggest that sexual selection may be important in this species. Although previous work has been conducted on the role of body size in male-male interactions, this appears to be the first study that attempts to isolate the effects of body size and body coloration on intraspecific interactions in the round goby. A series of fibreglass models of round gobies that varied in size and coloration was used to assess the response of resident males and females to different intruders. Results of the model experiment suggested that body size plays an important role in interactions between male and female round gobies. However, body coloration appeared to have much less influence on round goby behaviour.																			0394-9370	1828-7131				SEP	2007	19	3					183	191																WOS:000250320400002

This paper develops an approach to identifying signals and incorporating associated impacts on hydrological risk into water resources planning and management. The paper builds on earlier research reported in the climatology literature, and brings this to the engineering domain. An evaluation of seasonal rainfall in Guyana clearly demonstrates that distinct rainfall distributions are associated with La Nina and El Nino events. Forecasts of these events are made by a number of organisations at lead times of up to eight months. If these are coupled with the precipitation analysis presented in this paper, an objective hydrological risk assessment can be made. The methodology applied in Guyana has been repeated with data on net basin supply to Lake Victoria. There is a clear indication of a link between ENSO activity and net basin supply to Lake Victoria.																			1741-7589					SEP	2007	160	3					135	143		10.1680/wama.2007.160.3.135	http://dx.doi.org/10.1680/wama.2007.160.3.135													WOS:000248550900002

Ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis concentration techniques were used to achieve a 2000-fold DOP concentration factor. The sensitivity of the NMR was further enhanced by the use of the spin-lattice relaxation agent iron ethylenediaminetetraacetate (FeEDTA). These techniques are briefly discussed, in addition to the effects of pH, ionic strength, concentrated humic matrix, and FeEDTA on the P-31 FT-NMR spectra. Individual DOP species in lake water have not been conclusively identified with P-31 FT-NMR spectroscopy. The P-31 FT-NMR spectra indicate the presence of mono- and diester phosphates, and the presence of DNA is strongly suggested. P-31 FT-NMR spectra show seasonal changes that correlate to seasonal changes in the lake. Varying the sample pH and collecting the subsequent P-31 FT-NMR spectra illustrates that not all of the DOP species's signal positions are pH-dependent. This independence indicates possible DOP aggregate or micelle formation.																			0065-2393		0-8412-2526-5				1994	237						161	191																WOS:A1994BZ52H00006
J	Bradbury, JP				Bradbury, J. Platt			Late Cenozoic lacustrine and climatic environments at Tule Lake, northern Great Basin, USA	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												Cores of lake sediment to a depth of 334 m in the town of Tulelake, Siskiyou County, northern California, document the late Cenozoic paleolimnologic and paleoclimatic history of the northwestern edge of the Great Basin. The cores have been dated by radiometric, tephrochronologic and paleomagnetic analyses. Lacustrine diatoms are abundant throughout the record and document a nearly continuous paleolimnologic history of the Tule Lake basin for the last 3 Myr. During most of this time, this basin (Tule Lake) was a relatively deep, extensive lake. Except for a drier (and cooler?) interval recorded by Fragilaria species about 2.4 Ma, the Pliocene is characterized by a dominance of planktonic Aulacoseira solida implying a warm monomictic lake under a climatic regime of low seasonality. Much of the Pleistocene is dominated by Stephanodiscus and Fragilaria species suggesting a cooler, often drier, and highly variable climate. Benthic diatoms typical of alkaline-enriched saline waters commonly appear after 1.0 Ma, and tephrochronology indicates slow deposition and possible hiatuses between about 0.6 and 0.2 Ma. The chronology of even-numbered oxygen isotope stages approximately matches fluctuations in the abundance of Fragilaria since 800 ka indicating that glacial periods were expressed as drier environments at Tule Lake. Glacial and interglacial environments since 150 ka were distinct from, and more variable than, those occurring earlier. The last full glacial period was very dry, but shortly thereafter Tule Lake became a deep, cool lacustrine system indicating a substantial increase in precipitation. Aulacoseira ambigua characterized the latest glacial and Holocene record of Tule Lake. Its distribution indicates that warmer and wetter climates began about 15 ka in this part of the Great Basin. Diatom concentration fluctuates at 41 000 year intervals between 3.0 and 2.5 Ma and at approximately 100000 year intervals after 1.0 Ma. In the late Pliocene and early Pleistocene, Aulacoseira solida percentages wax and wane in an approximately 400 000 year cycle. The possible response of Tule Lake diatom communities to orbitally-induced insolation cycles underscores the importance of this record for the study of late Cenozoic paleoclimate change.																			0930-7575	1432-0894				JAN	1992	6	3-4					275	285																WOS:000207079600019

The samples have been collected at four stations, in ice-free periods, at monthly intervals for four years. In the water the mean concentrations of the heavy metals studies are one order of magnitude below the levels mentioned as allowable limits in the WHO recommendations on drinking water. In the sediment the concentration measured for the heavy metals remain below the limit acceptable for plants in soils (except for lead in the samples retrieved from the mouth of the River Zala). The concentration of solid lead and chromium compounds has surpassed in all samples that of the dissolved ones. The concentration of lead and chromium, but also that of nickel and zinc decrease thus perceptibly from the upper reaches of the River Zala towards the outflow from Minor Balaton. The analyses on fish and snails demonstrated the retention of Cu and occasionally of Pb and Hg in the pond, but also that the pollution reaching the pond is subject to seasonal and yearly fluctuations.

Composition, abundance and biomass of zooplankton in Orinoco floodplain lakes, Venezuela	ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Zooplankton samples were collected over a 21-month period in five floodplain lakes of the Orinoco River in order to establish zooplankton species composition, abundance patterns, and biomass and their relationships with the patterns of inundations and lake morphometry. 60 rotifer taxa were identified. This group was generally more abundant than copepods and cladocerans (mean : 73,4 % of total zooplankton). Common and abundant rotifer species included AT. americana, K. cochlearis, B. mirus, B. gessneri, P. vulgaris and F. longiseta. Copepods were dominated by nauplii (mean : 73,8 % of total copepod stages). Cladocerans were scarce and dominated by M. minuta, C. cornuta and D. spinulosum. Most frequent and abundant zooplankton species were euplanktonic with a dominance of filter feeders and micropha-gous detritivores. Mean zooplankton density in all lakes ranged from 340 ind./l to 3 486 ind./l. Biomass ranged from 71,1 mu g.l (dw) to 432,8 mu g/l. Rotifers accounted for 64,7 % of the total mean zooplankton biomass in three lakes while copepods accounted for 57,8 % of the biomass in two lakes. Both density and biomass were markedly seasonal with highest mean values at low waters. Mean density in the lakes was 100 times higher than in the Orinoco main stem. Lakes with highest variabilities in surface area and water depths showed highest zooplankton densities. The type of connection (direct or indirect) established between the lakes and the major source of the water also seemed important to interpret the productivity of floodplain lakes.																			0003-4088					JAN	1992	28	1					3	18		10.1051/limn/1992004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/1992004													WOS:000208073200001

J	CUTHBERT, FJ				CUTHBERT, FJ			MATE RETENTION IN CASPIAN TERNS	CONDOR												Colonial seabirds that nest in stable, predictable environments tend to breed with the same mate for consecutive seasons. In some of these populations, mate retention is correlated with previous reproductive success. Caspian terns (S. caspia) were obseved in northeastern Lake Michigan at several colony sites that vary in stability because of fluctuating water levels. Objectives of the study were to determine if individuals tend to keep the same mate for consecutive breeding attempts, if mate retention is influenced by previous reproductive success or inter-year nest site stability and if reproductive success is affected by mate change. Only 25% of the original pairs bred together for consecutive seasons, mate retention was independent of reproductive success the previous year but not of inter-year nest site stability, and no significant advantage was found in retaining the same mate for consecutive seasons. Factors other than previous reproductive success (e.g., habitat stability) influence mate selection and retention in this population of Caspian terns. Caution should be exercised in assuming that the relationship between mate retention and previous reproductive success holds for other species of colonial seabirds.																				1938-5129					1985	87	1					74	78		10.2307/1367133	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1367133													WOS:A1985ADM6400008

Food differed between seasons and reservoirs but overall, the diet consisted of 2, 2, 6 and 15 genera of diatoms, blue-green algae, green algae and animal material [Cladocera, Ostracoda, Copepoda, Rotifera and Insecta] respectively. None of the S. mossambicus populations maintained either a detritivorous, phytoplanktivorous or a zooplanktivorous habit through the yr. Detritivory was most common during the rainy season while phytoplanktivory predominated in the dry season. Blue-green algae were not an important constituent of the diet. Out of the 12 reservoir populations, 5 were predominantly detritivorous, 6 phytoplanktivorous and 1 zooplanktivorous. Detritus was completely absent in the ingested material in certain populations when they devoured animal or plant material, indicating the ability of S. mossambicus to switch from deposit to suspension feeding. The mean relative intestinal length (m.r.i.l.) of S. mossambicus ranged between 5.1 and 15.2. The m.r.i.l. decreased significantly with increasing body length: m.r.i.l. = 14.1-0.018 T.L.

J	JEFFRIES, DS; SNYDER, WR				JEFFRIES, DS; SNYDER, WR			ATMOSPHERIC DEPOSITION OF HEAVY-METALS IN CENTRAL ONTARIO	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												As part of a study to determine the magnitude of atmospheric inputs of materials into the lakes of central Ontario, a 4-station network of bulk deposition and wet-only precipitation samplers was established in the Muskoka-Haliburton and Sudbury regions to determine the deposition (mg/m2 per yr) and volume weighted concentration (.mu.g/l) of Pb, Cu, Ni, Zn, Al, Mn and Fe in precipitation. Large temporal variations in the monthly deposition of all metals were observed. Variations for Cu and Ni exhibited seasonal patterns which were attributed to a combination of source and wind direction factors. Concentration and deposition of all metals at Muskoka-Haliburton were generally as low or lower than median North American values from literature. At Sudbury, the large local smelting industry contributed to elevated Cu, Ni, Zn and Fe deposition measured in the region (up to 2 orders of magnitude larger than Muskoka-Haliburton); Al and Mn values were not elevated. Deposition of Cu, Ni and Fe was inversely related to distance from the largest point source at Sudbury. The importance of dry deposition was greatest at Sudbury where dry inputs of Cu, Zn, Al and Fe exceeded wet inputs. Wet deposition of metals at Muskoka-Haliburton predominated over dry. Calculation of an enrichment factor (normalized against Mn) showed that the levels of Pb, Cu, Ni and Zn observed in the precipitation of central Ontario required an additional non-crustal source (either natural or anthropogenic) for explanation.																			0049-6979	1573-2932					1981	15	2					127	152		10.1007/BF00161248	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00161248													WOS:A1981LG68000001
J	THORP, JH				THORP, JH			PATCHES AND THE RESPONSES OF LAKE BENTHOS TO SUNFISH NEST-BUILDING	OECOLOGIA												Males of three sunfish species (Centrarchidae) construct nests for spawning and often share them sequentially in the littoral zone of a 4-hectare lake in New York State [USA]. To determine spatial and temporal effects of this reproductive behavior on zoobenthos in "patches", I sampled bottom assemblages from inside nests and from adjacent (< 1 m from nest perimeter), relatively undisturbed sites during the reproductive season of 1986 and immediately prior to nest-building in 1987. The reproductive behaviors of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), redbreast sunfish (Lepomis auritus), and pumpkinseeds (L. gibbosus) altered relative abundances and significantly decreased benthic invertebrate diversity and density. These effects were extremely pronounced during the reproductive season and were partially detectable the following year. Community changes were probably the result of both bioturbation (modification of sediment size and organic content) and predation. The ecosystem-wide effects of nest-building are evaluated in terms of the number, distribution, and longevity of patches.																			0029-8549	1432-1939					1988	76	2					168	174		10.1007/BF00379949	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00379949								28312193					WOS:A1988P329300002
J	WELLER, SG				WELLER, SG			THE EFFECT OF DISTURBANCE SCALE ON SAND DUNE COLONIZATION BY LITHOSPERMUM-CAROLINIENSE	ECOLOGY												The effect of varying levels of natural sand deposition on emergence and survival of seedlings of Lithospermum caroliniense (Boraginacease) was investigated experimentally at four different distances from Lake Michigan [USA]. Nutlet mass was varied in the experiments to test for potential interactions between nutlet mass and the degree of sand deposition. On the two rapidly accreting sand dunes closest to Lake Michigan, substantial sand deposition prevented emergence of all but a few seedlings. In two other sites located in stable areas farther from the lake, emergence averaged from 55 to 72.5%. The main effect of nutlet size on emergence was significant, although no interaction with distance from the lake was noted because of the lack of sand deposition at sites distant from the lake. Survival through the first season of seedlings located in one the stable areas was only 9%, due to desiccation and the burrowing activity of mammals. Survival of seedlings in the other stable area, located on the first dune where naturally established L. caroliniense is found, averaged 36%. Most of these individuals survived to 1985, and fared far better than naturally established individuals located at greater distances from the lake, where lake climatic effects diminish. In a separate experiment, located at the periphery of a localized disturbance known as a blowout, 2-4 cm of sand deposition favored the emergence of seedlings in the two areas closest to the edge of the disturbance. There, seedlings produced by larger nutlets had a disproportionate advantage because of their ability to emerge from greater depths. In the third site, located further from the center of the blowout in a stable area, larger nutlets had no advantage during emergence. These experiments indicate that sand deposition has favored the evolution of increased nutlet mass in L. caroliniense. It appears that a combination of lake climatic effect and moderate sand deposition is most favorable for growth and establishment of this species.																			0012-9658	1939-9170				OCT	1989	70	5					1244	1251		10.2307/1938182	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1938182													WOS:A1989AR65900005

In recent years it has invaded numerous ponds and lakes (including many trout fisheries) in the United Kingdom and is known from several major river systems (Wye, Tamar, Tweed, Tyne). It has regularly formed extensive growths in a eutrophic lake in south-west England (Loe Pool) since first observed in 1989. Its small colonies are usually evident when its water is about 15 degrees C, a temperature reached towards the end of May in 1995 and 2-3 weeks later in 1996. These floating, air-filled colonies act as a dispersive-phase and within days of first detection become distributed throughout the lake, often accumulating along downwind shores. As they expand and loose entrapped air, the colonies sink and many eventually come to blanket the lake floor. These colonies form dense entangled mats that exhibit diurnal movement when healthy, often sinking at night or during unstable weather and rising to the lake surface on calm sunny days. By August, most subsurface mats of Hydrodictyon had disappeared from all but a few small bays and a dense Microcystis aeruginosa bloom had developed. In 1993 this cyanobacterium was not present in any significant quantity and massive growths of Hydrodictyon persisted through August and most of September. It is hypothesised that some form of interaction between Microcystis and Hydrodictyon accounts for the latters rapid decline in July. There is no convincing evidence to indicate that Hydrodictyon has any significant impact upon the phytoplankton since these exhibit a similar seasonal succession compared to other small eutrophic lakes in the UK. Some zooplankton (nauplii, calanoids) show abundance peaks during the main growth phase of Hydrodictyon (June, July). There is no direct evidence to indicate that its mats provide a refuge for plankton grazers although molluscs and leeches are particularly common in Hydrodictyon mats.																			0006-3088					AUG	1998	53	4					537	545																WOS:000076296400023
J	Celiker, M				Celiker, Murat			Determination of the interaction between groundwater and surface water using environmental isotopes (Oxygen-18, Deuterium and Tritium) and chemical analyses in Uluova Region, Elazig, Turkey	JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING RESEARCH												In this study, the effects of surface waters on groundwater aquifers were examined via physico-chemical analyses and environmental isotopes. The study was carried out in the Uluova region located 10 km northeast of the city of Elazig (Turkey). Water samples were acquired from the Uluova aquifer, Keban Dam Lake, Hazar Lake and Haringet stream during the wet and dry seasons. The water samples were analyzed for Oxygen-18, Deuterium, Tritium, temperature (T), electrical conductivity (EC) and Chloride (Cl-). According to the results of environmental isotope analysis, three different groups of water masses were identified in the basin in the wet and dry seasons. The equation of the line formed by the points in the Oxygen-18 - Deuterium graph for water samples received from the Uluova region was defined as delta D=6 delta O-18 - 10.50 for dry season and as delta D=6 delta O-18 - 8.66 for wet season. Tritium values of water samples were classified as 0-4 TU, 4-6 TU and 6-12 TU for wet and dry seasons, respectively. Consequently, it was found that Uluova groundwater aquifer is fed by daily precipitations. The surface water irrigations from Keban Dam Lake and Hazar Lake affect the aquifer during irrigation season. This has not changed the classification made by the Tritium content of the aquifer.

Glebokie Lake is a reservoir with a negative water balance related to the location draining groundwater drinking water intake for Szczecin agglomeration. In 2004 hydrotechnical regulations were conducted aimed at maintaining a constant amount of water in the lake, which involved a temporary feeding Glebokie Lake with Gunica River waters. In order to determine the hydrochemical status of the Lake waters and the factors shaping water quality 19 water quality indices within 25 months were measured: temperature, pH and water oxygen status, nutrients (N, P) and ionic macrocomponents and Fe-tot. Trophic status of the lake waters using the Carlson criteria was defined. On the basis of chemometric analysis of measurement data (CA, PCA/FA and DA) we established that statistically significant factors affecting water quality in the study period were: seasonal (the climatic seasons) changes in the biological processes activity, periodical (in April and November) waters inflows from the Gunica River, anthropopressure in during swimming season and the coagulant (FeSO4) presence in the ecosystem. The possibility of applying the chemometric techniques to interpret measurement data in the lake type like Glebokie Lake with a small amount of data has been shown.

J	COLWELL, MA; ORING, LW				COLWELL, MA; ORING, LW			NEST-SITE CHARACTERISTICS OF PRAIRIE SHOREBIRDS	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Nest-site characteristics of eight shorebird species were studied during the period 1982-1984 at Last Mountain Lake National Wildlife Area in south central Saskatchewan [Canada]. Plant species composition at nests varied significantly among species and was correlated with distance to bare ground and aquatic habitat. Flora at Wilson''s phalarope (Phalaropus tricolor) nests was correlated with clutch initiation date, reflecting a seasonal shift in nesting habitat. Species differed significantly in cover types at nests. For American avocet (Recurvirostra americana), killdeer (Charadrius vociferus), and Wilson''s phalarope, cover types differed between nests and random sites; cover types also differed between nest cups and the immediate surrounding habitat for killdeer and Wilson''s phalarope. Interspecific differences in nest-site vegetation physiognomy were portrayed by the first two factors of a principal components analysis, which accounted for 73 and 22% of variance in the data, respectively. Principal components analysis assembled species on a habitat gradient that varied according to cover type, and vegetation density and heterogeneity.																			0008-4301	1480-3283				FEB	1990	68	2					297	302		10.1139/z90-044	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z90-044													WOS:A1990CX26600014

The Casper Creek drainage basin contributed the largest Se load of the five tributary sites to the North Platte River. The 4-d average Se concentration in water samples from one site in the part of the North Platte River that receives irrigation return flows exceeded the 5 mug/l U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's aquatic life criterion five times during a 50-d monitoring period in 1989. In agreement with the water-quality data, muscle and liver tissue from rainbow trout collected from the same part of the North Platte River had Se concentrations exceeding levels known to cause reproductive failure and chronic Se poisoning. On the basis of Se: Cl, O-18/O-16 and D/H ratios in water from Goose and Rasmus Lee Lakes (closed-basin systems), the large Se concentrations in those lakes were derived by natural evaporation of irrigation water without leaching of soluble forms of Se from soil or rocks. Water samples from Thirtythree Mile Reservoir and Illco Pond (flow-through systems) showed considerable enrichment in Se over evaporative concentration, presumably due to leaching and desorption of Se from soil and rock. The Se: Cl ratios of irrigation drain water collected from the KRP indicate that leaching and desorption of soluble forms of Se from soils and rocks are the dominant processes in drain water. Results of a Wilcoxon matched-pairs test for 43 paired drain-water samples collected during June and August 1988, indicated there is a statistically larger concentration of Se (0.01 significance level) during the June sampling period. The larger concentrations of Se and other chemical constitutents during the early part of the irrigation season probably were due to dissolution of seleniferous salts that have accumulated in soils within the KRP since the last irrigation season. The large Se concentrations in water samples from wetland sites in the KRP were reflected in the aquatic-bird food chain. Most waterfowl and shorebirds nesting at the KRP showed Se concentrations in livers and eggs greater than levels suspected of causing adverse reproductive effects.																			0883-2927					MAR	1993	8	2					115	126		10.1016/0883-2927(93)90028-F	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0883-2927(93)90028-F													WOS:A1993KP61000001
J	Tallberg, P; Hartikainen, H; Kairesalo, T				Tallberg, P; Hartikainen, H; Kairesalo, T			Why is soluble silicon in interstitial and lake water samples immobilized by freezing?	WATER RESEARCH												The reasons behind the lowering of the spectrophotometrically measurable silicon (Si) content in sediment interstitial and unfiltered lake water samples after storage in frozen form were explored. The storage container material had little effect on the immobilization, whereas lowering the pH of interstitial water samples before freezing decreased the ''loss'' of Si. When interstitial water samples were frozen, both native, naturally present Si and added standard solution Si were immobilized. The same reaction pattern was found for native Si in unfiltered lake water samples. On the contrary, neither the native Si in filtered lake water nor added standard solution Si was immobilized when lake water samples were frozen, indicating that high concentrations of particulate material, especially in the interstitial water, was the prime cause of the immobilization phenomenon. The results obtained in a sequential filtration (0.2 mu m, 100,000 and 10,000 daltons) experiment with interstitial water samples supported the theory that Si is immobilized through polymerization or complex formation mediated by particulate material and molecules present in interstitial water. An incubation test revealed that the immobilization process was not entirely reversible. The amount, nature and behaviour of Si in interstitial water samples showed some seasonal variation.

The development of a population of Thiocystis minor (formerly Chromatium minus ) in the deepest, anoxic layers of Moncortes Lake (Lleida, Spain) was studied by means of an in situ , laser particle analyser. Particle size distribution was measured at hourly and monthly time intervals. 2. The population was located between the redoxcline (similar to3 m below the mean population depth) and the oxycline (similar to6 m above the mean population depth) with a seasonal vertical displacement (SVD) of up to 6 m (from April to October). 3. Diel vertical migration of the population was followed in three field campaigns, when the population was most abundant. The largest vertical displacement was 2.8 m (in 11.5 h) and the fastest vertical displacement was 0.6 m h(-1) . Sudden changes in the irradiance reaching the bacterial population were detected by the cells, which moved up or down, rapidly modifying the mean vertical position of the population. 4. There was positive phototaxis with an ascent during the morning and a descent during the afternoon/night. The whole population was active while migrating upwards (towards higher light intensity) or downwards (towards lower redox concentration).					; Vila, Xavier/N-9871-2015; Colomer, Jordi/Y-5386-2018; Serra, Teresa/L-9279-2014	Soler, Marianna/0000-0001-8422-1609; Serra, Teresa/0000-0002-6075-5849; Colomer, Jordi/0000-0002-9330-0269													0046-5070					APR	2003	48	4					698	708		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.01039.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.01039.x													WOS:000181632400011
J	Berroterán, JL				Berroterán, JL			Cereal-pasture utilization model in farm systems on well drained savannas with acid soils in Venezuela	INTERCIENCIA												This paper proposes a management model for acid-soil savannas applicable to mixed farm systems, to make efficient use of the available forage throughout the year. The area of low-fertility soils in the Venezuelan savannas covers a surface of about 130,000 km(2). They have a mesoclimate with a pronounced rainy season and a dry season with hydric deficit, with the exception of the Maracaibo Lake basin, where there are two rainy periods. These low-fertility savannas have calcium, potassium and phosphorus deficiencies, and low cation exchange capacity. The theoretical model is a Forrester diagram type into which basic information about monthly rates of growth and forage biomass availability was incorporated, and the mathematical functions were adjusted for curves of available biomass in time and for their capacity of animal sustenance. It was based on the strategic use of forage resources in native savannas, established grasses, and cereal crop residues in different month and year periods. It is concluded that for maintenance of a fixed monthly carrying capacity of 1+/- 0.15 UA/ha, a unit of vegetal-animal farm system must contain the following area proportions: 31-36% of native savanna or under fallow, 34-42% of established grasses, and 27-31% of maize or other cereal.																			0378-1844					JUL	2000	25	4					203	209																WOS:000088084100005

(Lat, 47.degree. 03''N, Long. 84.degree. 15''W) were examined in relation to those in precipitation at the watershed and at other places in eastern Canada. The mean annual concentration of Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+, H+, NH4+, NO3-, SO42-, Cl- and HCO3- in precipitation, throughfall, forest floor percolate and mineral soil solution were evaluated, and the annual flux of H+, NO3-, SO42- and base cations was calculated. The annual input of cations by bulk precipitation was only a small proportion (17%) of the flux collected below the forest floor. The deposition of SO42- and NO3- in bulk precipitation accounted for 85 and 45%, respectively, of the forest floor fluxes of these ions. The annual flux of H+ in throughfall was less than that in precipitation. Calcium and Mg2+ concentrations in soil solution were highly correlated (P = 0.05) with NO3- during the dormant season and Ca2+ was highly correlate with SO42- during the growing season. Both SO42- and NO3- were largely unreactive with minerals in the Turkey Lakes soil and therefore play a dominant role in cation movement through the soil.																			0378-1127	1872-7042					1985	12	3-4					215	231		10.1016/0378-1127(85)90092-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0378-1127(85)90092-1													WOS:A1985AUF3000005
J	CURRIE, DJ				CURRIE, DJ			PHOSPHORUS DEFICIENCY AND ITS VARIATION AMONG LAKES	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												The severity of phosphorus deficiency varies greatly among lakes. Is this variation related to particular morphological, chemical, or biological characteristics of lakes? These questions were addressed by sampling 49 lakes in Quebec, Ontario, and the northeastern United States. The rate constant of orthophosphate uptake (k1), a measure of orthophosphate demand:supply, proved to be only weakly related to watershed area and to the total phosphorus (P) concentration of the water (R2 = 0.210). Abundance of the biota and other aspects of water chemistry were all unrelated to the intensity of P-deficiency as it varies among lakes. In contrast, within-lake seasonal variability of the rate constant of orthophosphate turnover (kt, which is approximately equal to k1) is strongly related to temperature and bacterial abundance (R2 = 0.575 to 0.828). The results indicate that the seasonal variation in phosphorus deficiency depends strongly on bacterioplankton activity, whereas inter-lake variability in phosphorus deficiency is determined mainly by factors other than morphometry, plankton abundance, or trophic richness.

As a result, a 2.5-km long section required complete reconstruction. This work was completed in approximatley 12 months, at a cost of IR1.5 million. The canal was rewatered in March 1990. The banksides, above normal water level, were dressed with a layer of moss peat and seeded with a mixture of grasses. The grass roots failed to bind the peat to the sub-layer of Puddle Clay and significant erosion resulted in the season of treatment. In order to halt the harmful erosion and to expedite the natural reed colonisation process, roots and rhizomes from established monocotyledonous plant colonies, external to the canal, were acquired. This paper presents the findings from transplantation trials using Schoenoplectus lacustris, Glyceria maxima and Phragmites australis from river and lake habitats and comments on the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of this operation.

ANOVA techniques and autocorrelation analyses were used to partition the variance in Titicaca, and in some comparison tropical and temperate series, into components with repeatable annual cycles and components attributable to other kinds of patterns. In Titicaca, insolation and stratification are highly seasonal in pattern of variation, although the amount of variance relative to means is small compared to temperte lakes.

Rankings of abundance of year-classes changed between the ends of the 1st and 3rd growing seasons; apparently ultimate year-class strength was influenced strongly by mortality of age I and II fish. Predation by walleyes was probably the principal cause of mortality of age I and II perch. Although frequency of occurrence of age I and II perch in stomachs of walleyes was low, density of juvenile perch also was low and walleyes probably consumed a large proportion of each perch cohort. Rates of mortality were modified by perch length, perch density and density of age 0 perch, all of which relate to intensity of walleye predation.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1980	37	1					11	19		10.1139/f80-002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f80-002													WOS:A1980JG86300002

Over the experimental. period, the filter-pore sizes of the fish and the total biomass of the phytoplankton in each enclosure changed little with time. The fish biomass in each enclosure increased with time, while the percentage of weight gain correlated negatively to the stocking density, due perhaps to competition for prey. Analysis of gut contents of silver carp showed a strong similarity between the algae in the foregut and the algal communities in the water and this was significant (p<0.05) for the enclosure with a low fish density. There were weak relationships between the size/shape of phytoplankters and the selectivity of fish on them (r=0.001, p>0.5). Silver carp fed unselectively when cyanobacteria populations were high, even though the selectivity index for diatoms was slightly higher than those for cyanobacteria, green algae, and cryptomonads.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				MAR	2003	18	1					69	77		10.1080/02705060.2003.9663952	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2003.9663952													WOS:000181291800007

The sensing system included a combination electrode, pH meter and portable computer powered by a marine battery. Temperature and pH information from the pH meter were acquired every 10 min and stored in the computer. The two ponds, located within 2 km of one another, have a different average pH and sensitivity to acid precipitation. Maquan Pond has an average pH of 6.0 and an alkalinity of 7.4 mg/l, while Furnace Pond has an average pH of 6.9 and alkalinity of 14.9 mg/l. The pH of both ponds varied seasonally and showed diel changes due to the photosynthetic and respiratory activity of aquatic organisms. Precipitation events did not change the pH of Furnace Pond. Maquan Pond on the other hand, did exhibit changes in surface water pH due to specific acidic precipitation events. During certain rainstorms, the pH of Maquan surface waters dropped to values as low as pH 4. In addition to the transient changes in pH, the acid-sensitive pond also exhibited differences in planktonic distribution patterns. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Bosmina population behaviour in the field was consistent with the idea that large numbers of Asterionella caused its starvation. Individuals were actually colourless and fecundity dropped to zero, as was evident when Asterionella reached 99.4% of total phytoplankton biovolume. Since cyanophytes, as a whole, are scarce in these lakes, we propose that the flagellate/diatom ratio has a direct effect on cladoceran demography.					; Balseiro, Esteban/Y-2743-2019	Modenutti, Beatriz/0000-0002-8683-5679; Balseiro, Esteban/0000-0002-5052-0587													0018-8158					OCT 18	1991	224	2					111	116		10.1007/BF00006867	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00006867													WOS:A1991GV84300006
J	Rankovic, B				Rankovic, B			Populations of fungi in some reservoirs in Serbia	CRYPTOGAMIE MYCOLOGIE												The paper presents results of mycological studies conducted in the three larger reservoirs in Serbia (Celije, Grosnica and Gruza), which have different hydrological and production characteristics. These studies were conducted during all seasons of 1996. The quantitative analysis of fungal communities showed that the average number of their spores in these reservoirs was between 2000 and 4990 per liter of water, The highest number of spores was found in eutrophic reservoir of Gruza and the lowest identified in oligo-mesotrophic reservoir of Celije. Number of spores was higher in the water samples taken near the bottom of the lakes and in littoral zone rich with macrovegetation, than in the middle water layers. In these reservoirs 45 species were identified out of 384 isolates. The most dominant genera were Aspergillus, Penicillium, Cladosporium, Fusarium, Phoma, Rhizopus and Verticillium. The autochthonous aquatic fungal community was composed of the following species:Achlya americana, Achlya racemosa, Catenaria sp., Dictyuchus sterile, Pythium ultimum, Saprolegnia ferax, Saprolegnia hypogyna and Saprolegnia monica.																			0181-1584	1776-100X				JUN	1998	19	1-2					79	86																WOS:000075072300007

Lake Patzcuaro has been exposed in the recent past to environmental deterioration with increasing eutrophication as a result of deforestation, indiscriminate use of agrochemicals, overfishing, unplanned urban growth, and sewage dumping. Goals. In order to contribute to the phycofloristic inventory of the Lake, we present the taxonomic description of the periphytic diatoms found, including morphometric information, meristic data, figures, as well as ecological and distributional notes. Methods. Sampling was carried out in four sites during two periods: after the rainy season (October 2004) and the dry season (May 2005); samples were gathered by scraping rooted and floating vegetation. Diatoms' thecae were cleared with hydrochloric acid and hydrogen peroxide; permanent slides were made with Naphrax (R) resin and analyzed through optic microscopy. Results. A total of 83 periphytic diatom species were recorded, including eight varieties and one form; 20 species (24%) represent the first records for Mexico and 57 (68.6%) are new to the study area. Sixty-two species (74.7%) have cosmopolitan distribution and six (7.2%) have tropical affinity. Species richness was slightly higher after the rainy season (October 2004) with a total of 69 taxa, compared to 65 species recorded during the dry season (May 2005). Among the sampling sites, the island of Janitzio had the highest diatom diversity (46 taxa during the dry season). Conclusions. Deterioration of Lake Patzcuaro in the previous decades has taken a toll on the health of its ecological system. Diatoms identified in this study indicate a clear tendency of eutrophication of the waterbody.																			0188-8897						2016	26	2					161	185																WOS:000392826100002

Elemental Analysis of River Water from Transylvania, Romania, by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry and Chemometrics	ANALYTICAL LETTERS												The objectives of this study were to determine metals in water samples obtained from three main rivers from Transylvania in two seasons and to apply chemometric methods for further interpretation. Inductive coupled plasma-mass spectrometry was used for these analyzes. Chemometric techniques, including analysis of variance, Pearson correlation, cluster analysis, and principal component analysis were applied for assessing variation in the results. Analysis of variance highlighted elements that were influenced by increased river flow in the wet season, and Pearson correlation established a positive correlation between elements. Cluster analysis showed a number of sample points in two main clusters according to their loading. Principal component analysis extracted five main components with each characterized by specific metals. These results are useful in monitoring studies because the river management plan may be improved by reducing the number of sampling points and monitoring parameters to those that are representative of each river basin.

They are small aquatic bodies, but perform significant environmental, social and economic functions. Their contribution ranges from being a source of drinking water, recharging groundwater, acting as sponges to control flooding, supporting biodiversity and providing livelihoods. Many economic sectors such as agriculture, domestic applications consider lakes as easily available source of water for their day to day needs. Lakes may be man-made or natural, fresh water or brackish; but they play a very vital role in maintaining environmental sustainability particularly in urban environments. In today's urbanization, especially in contexts when the cities are facing the challenges of enhanced traffic and pollution, lakes and freshwater bodies are the hopes for restoring the ecosystem. At present, in India, lakes and wetlands are in extremely bad shape and are suffering from varying degrees of environmental degradation. Despite knowing their environmental, social and economic significance, city planners have given least importance to protect them and have even destroyed these water bodies. Due to unplanned industrialization, much of the landscape around the lakes in urban area and their surroundings has been covered by impervious surfaces. As a result, instead of rainwater, it is the sewage and effluents that are filling up urban water bodies. Once the known sponges of urban area, today urban lakes have turned into hazards needing utmost attention, that get choked even with low rainfall and overflow into the blocked canals during high rainfall. In recent times, during the rainy season, the lakes and fresh water bodies have become reasons for causing floods in the city. The cities are witnessing eventual disappearance of these sponges that has exacerbated floods and sharpened the pain of droughts. In an attempt to provide a solution to this complex problem, our paper presents a model and testing mechanism towards bringing the awareness about the lake water health monitoring. Our system consists of sensors including temperature, Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) and pH sensor to calculate the water quality index and create the mathematical model to predict the variation of the parameters in the future. The system will help the stakeholders and public to be aware of the condition of the lakes and take corrective actions to prevent further degradation.

Present study discusses the impacts of depth on water quality by using multivariate statistical analysis. This well established phenomenon of correlation between lake depth and water is firstly proved by using multivariate statistical techniques. Depth of Rawal Lake was divided into three groups of surface, middle and bottom to analyze impacts between these stages on water quality. There were sixteen parameters (physico-chemical, bacteriological and metals) analyzed for which samples were collected and analyzed from a fresh water Rawal lake for four seasons in 2012-2013. The statistical correlation was developed between the water quality parameters and between the layers, by using multivariate scatterplot, cluster analysis and discriminant analysis. Results of these statistical techniques revealed a strong correlation (positive or negative) among most of the water quality parameters. Aluminum was found to be with medium variability and temperature at high variability in cluster analysis. Statistically significant correlation was found between the two dimensions of canonical discriminant functions with canonical correlation of 0.957 and 0.586. Therefore, these statistical analyses validated the high impact of depth on different water quality parameters.

It is critical to ensure the quality in the reservoir. Turnover time is identified to influence the water quality significantly. In this study, the effect of air temperature variations on turnover time in a reservoir on Fushan Mountain (Qingdao, Shandong Province, China) has been investigated by field observations. We have monitored the temperature profiles in the reservoir during the stratification period and mixing period in continuous three years. The theoretical turnover time was also calculated. The monitored data indicated that the turnover time in 2016 was much earlier than that in other two years. The reasons for turnover time variations were studied. Ruled out the possible effects of wind, water depth and the average hypolimnion temperature, the air temperature fluctuation (affecting the epilimnion water temperature mostly) was found to be in charge of the reservoir being mixed earlier. Therefore attentions should also be focused on air temperature fluctuation in the prediction and management of seasonal stratified reservoirs.																			2468-5747		978-94-6252-287-9				2016	3						354	357																WOS:000428894400079

SEASONAL DISTRIBUTION OF EPIPELIC DIATOM ASSEMBLAGES AND RELATIONS TO ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES IN A MESOTROPHIC POND	OXIDATION COMMUNICATIONS												The seasonal succession of diatom species in the epipelon of shallow, mesotrophic pond OMU Pond I (Turkey) with special attention to diatoms (particularly Navicula) is described. The composition of epipelic algal assemblages changed over time in both higher taxonomic groupings and species representations. September month was characterised by a dominance of Navicula hungarica var. capitata. The occurrence of diatom species also correlated with water temperature. However, although the growth of some species was restricted to a particular month, other species or species complexes had more extended growth periods. Navicula cryptocephala and Amphora ovalis species have been selected to demonstrate variation in temporal distribution within species complexes. Using the epipelic diatoms as indicators of environmental conditions, OMU Pond I was characterised with regard to their water chemistry. Samples were collected, species richness and diversity (Shannon-Wiener, H) were measured monthly. The results of analysis have supported the results of the counting method. Multivariate analyses indicated that both the regional distribution and seasonal variation of benthic diatoms are mainly driven by nutrient concentration. Diatoms are predominantly affected by geochemical characteristics including temperature and dissolved oxygen levels.

The results show that the annual water diversion quantity of South-to-North Water Diversion Project has very little impact on the annual runoff, runoff in dry season and minimum monthly runoff of the downstream Jiujiang hydrological station after the regulating of Danjiangkou, which are without obvious influence on the downstream river-lake relation.

The site merges with the Tfeborisko protected landscape area and UNESCO biosphere reserve. In agreement with local farming subject these management practices were altered significantly during 2014 and 2015. The fishpond was left free from carp stock and small number of breeding tench and pikeperch was stocked instead. Such a dramatic reduction of fish population induced fundamental change in plankton structure and consequently in the whole fishpond biocenosis. Over the past 20 years, Rod fishpond was exhibiting characteristics of shallow turbid lake with high abundance of phytoplankton biomass comprising of green algae, blue-green algae and flagellates. In 2014, when fish stock had already been reduced, large zooplankton development brought about a clear water stage. At the same time, considerable nutrient reserves in the ecosystem lead to enormous Aphanizomenon flosaquae blooms. These blue-green algae species have not been observed in Rod fishpond in past two decades. The second year was characterised with remarkable development of macro-scale vegetation of Ceratophyllum demersum and Potamogeton pectinatus. Plant coverage of the open water area reached 6.13 ha during the growing season maximum. Also, a significant volume of nutrients was bound in the macro-vegetation. Neither such vigorous growth of submerged vegetation has been observed over the past 20 years. Extreme phosphorus mobilization was recorded during the two years of extensive management practices. Concentration of total phosphorus in Aphanizomenonflos-aquae reached 1.4 mg/l. Analysis of Ceratophyllum demerswn biomass samples confirmed phosphorus concentration of 0.4%, meaning 1.408 g of phosphorus per meter squared of the pond area. Related to the total coverage area, phosphorus bound in aquatic vegetation amounted for 86,310 g. At the same time, concentration of phosphorus measured in water amounted to 0.82 mg/l.																			1314-2704		978-619-7105-65-0				2016							693	700																WOS:000391519100092

Echo Signal Analysis for Underwater Sediment Classification in Tropical Regions	OCEANS 2016 MTS/IEEE MONTEREY					MTS/IEEE Oceans Conference	SEP 19-23, 2016	Monterey, CA	MTS, IEEE				Fresh water, sediment classification is increasingly becoming critical for numerous water resource management initiatives with growing depletion of natural resources and increasing human population. The tropical regions with their concentration of monsoons into few months in a year, experience heavy flow and subsequent siltation of water reservoirs, rivers, dams, etc. Heavy siltation depletes the storage capacities, impacting the sustainability during the dry seasons. Acoustic techniques can potentially provide efficient and cost effective assessment for planning of long term utilization in irrigation, power generation, industry, and urban power supply and flood moderation. Analysis of underwater sediment using single-beam and multi-beam echo sounders has been recognized as an effective tool in sea/river floor classification. Empirical method of sea/river floor classification relies on features extracted from the backscatter signal such as maximum amplitude, echo duration, energy and higher order moments. These features are highly dependent on the medium properties, bottom properties and specifications of the sonar like frequency, beam width, incident angle, and etc. Received signal characteristics are sensitive to physical properties of medium such as sound speed and sediment reflectivity. This paper discusses the significance of grazing angle, transmission loss and seasonal variation in the Sound Velocity Profile (SVP) for the application of sediment classification. Khadakwasala Lake (latitude 18.34(0) and longitude 73.76(0)) in central India has been chosen as an experimental site to undertake the simulation study for a tropical shallow fresh water reservoir. The effect of sound speed on backscatter strength is analyzed using Kirchhoff's model by considering seasonal variation of realistic SVP. The bellhop ray tracing model is used for computation of transmission loss and the channel impulse response. Linear Frequency Modulated (LFM) signal the spectral band 50 to 100 kHz has been used as a probing signal for sediment types of sand, fine sand, mud and mixed sediment.					; Joshi, Yashwant/R-2122-2018	Joshi, Yashwant/0000-0002-0508-7585; 															978-1-5090-1537-5				2016										10.1109/OCEANS.2016.7761370	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.2016.7761370													WOS:000399929002052

But this also includes a plethora of uncultured bacterial representations. Owing to their metabolism, they directly influence biogeochemical cycles, which underscores the the important status of bacteria on our planet. To study the function of a gene from an uncultured bacterium, we have undertaken a de novo gene synthesis approach. Actinobacteria of the acI-B subcluster are important but yet uncultured members of the bacterioplankton in temperate lakes of the northern hemisphere such as oligotrophic Lake Stechlin (NE Germany). This lake is relatively poor in phosphate (P) and harbors on average similar to 1.3 x 10(6) bacterial cells/ml, whereby Actinobacteria of the ac-I lineage can contribute to almost half of the entire bacterial community depending on seasonal variability. Single cell genome analysis of Actinobacterium SCGC AB141-P03, a member of the acI-B tribe in Lake Stechlin has revealed several phosphate-metabolizing genes. The genome of acI-B Actinobacteria indicates potential to degrade polyphosphate compound. To test for this genetic potential, we targeted the exoP-annotated gene potentially encoding polyphosphatase and synthesized it artificially to examine its biochemical role. Heterologous overexpression of the gene in Escherichia coli and protein purification revealed phosphatase activity. Comparative genome analysis suggested that homologs of this gene should be also present in other Actinobacteria of the acI lineages. This strategic retention of specialized genes in their genome provides a metabolic advantage over other members of the aquatic food web in a P-limited ecosystem.					; McMahon, Katherine/JXY-0145-2024; Grossart, Hans-Peter/E-6705-2017	Stepanauskas, Ramunas/0000-0003-4458-3108; Srivastava, Abhishek/0000-0002-8459-471X													1139-6709	1618-1905					2016	19	1					39	47		10.2436/20.1501.01.262	http://dx.doi.org/10.2436/20.1501.01.262								27762428					WOS:000389752300005

On the hydrogeological modelling of complex rockslides	LANDSLIDES AND ENGINEERED SLOPES: EXPERIENCE, THEORY AND PRACTICE, VOLS 1-3					12th International Symposium on Landslides	JUN 12-19, 2016	Napoli, ITALY					The aim of this paper is assessing the effect of oscillation of groundwater level, which is a major input in rockslide and deep-seated gravitational slope deformation, using numerical groundwater modelling techniques. Movements of these landslides could be related to annual/seasonal changes of external factors (e.g. rainfall, snowmelt, temperature oscillations) or to human actions (e.g. impounding of landslide toe by artificial lakes, excavations). These factors can be responsible of both the initial failure as well the successive reactivation or the continuous slow motion. In our study we focused on two examples of recent or historic landslides for which a suitable dataset is available: the Mt. de La Saxe rockslide (2009-2012, Aosta valley; Italian Western Alps) and the Vajont rockslide (from 1960 to October 9th 1963). For two representative sections we developed 2D steady and transient groundwater flow models using a finite element software (FEFLOW). Hydraulic head distributions coming from the initial steady state hydrogeological models are used as base for complex transient models were time series of infiltration, resulting from precipitation, temperature, snowmelt data (La Saxe rockslide) and reservoir level (Vajont rockslide), are applied. The two examples can be useful for a better understanding of the evolution of rockslides and suggest the required set of data and modelling approaches both for seasonal and long term slope stability analyses.

The results show that species belonging to the phylum Cyanophyta occupied the maximum proportion of phytoplankton biomass, and that the dominant population in the water source area of Chaohu City was M. aeruginosa. The variation in cyanobacterial biomass from March to August 2012 was well fitted to the logistic growth model. The growth rate of cyanobacteria was the highest in June, and the biomass of cyanobacteria reached a maximum in August. From February to March 2012, the main form of M. aeruginosa was the single-cell form; M. aeruginosa colonies began to appear from April, and blooms appeared on the water surface in May. The maximum diameter of the colonies was recorded in July, and then gradually decreased from August. The diameter range of M. aeruginosa colonies was 18.37-237.77 mu m, and most of the colonies were distributed in the range 20-200 mu m, comprising 95.5% of the total number of samples. Temperature and photosynthetically active radiation may be the most important factors that influenced the annual variation in M. aeruginosa biomass and forms. The suitable temperature for cyanobacterial growth was in the range of 15-30A degrees C. In natural water bodies, photosynthetically active radiation had a significant positive influence on the colonial diameter of M. aeruginosa (P < 0.01).

Overnight CO2 uptake by the leaves of I. bolanderi contributed up to 33% of the total daily carbon assimilation from the water column which is typical of aquatic CAM species but low in comparison to the 30-50% seen in the seasonal pool congener Isoetes howellii. Two additional sources of carbon may supplement the 24-hour period for carbon assimilation conferred by CAM in I. bolanderi: the refixation of respiratory CO2 and carbon acquistion from the interstitial sediment water via roots. CAM appears to play a significant role in enhancing carbon gain in I. bolanderi which dominates the littoral flora of Siesta and Ellery Lakes despite higher carbon uptake rates from the water column found in one associated macrophyte Fontinalis antipyretica.																			0002-9122	1537-2197				MAY	1990	77	5					682	688		10.2307/2444815	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2444815													WOS:A1990DF90200011

Three Chaoborus species dominated in abundance and biomass the mid-lake benthic fauna of a small, natural Nigerian lake. Each population showed distinct seasonal variations, C. anomalus being most abundant during the early rainy season, while C. ceratopogones and C. edulis were most abundant during the dry season. A fourth species, C. fuscinervis (not reported previously from West Africa), was collected only in the adult stage. Also abundant at mid-like were the Tanypus brevipalpis, all of which showed a seasonal pattern most resembling that of C. anomalus 2. Second, third and fourth instar larvae and pupae of the Chaoborus species underwent a diel vertical migration between the lake sediments (diurnal) and the water column (nocturnal) which was strongly related to prevailing light conditions. 3. Lunar periodicities of Chaoborus emergence determined from emergence trap collections are described for the first time. Corresponding lunar periodicities of larval abundance were observed in two of the species. The statistical techniques employed in describing the lunar periodicities permit the estimation of generation times. 4. C. anomalus is believed to be parthenogenetic in the study lake (no males collected), while the other Chaoborus species are bisexual (1:1 sex ratios). The biology of this species is discussed in relation to the parthenogenetic condition.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				DEC	1986	16	6					759	780		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1986.tb01016.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1986.tb01016.x													WOS:A1986F191700005

In one lake, four sequential applications every 44 days of sufficient Mariner to result in 25 ppb bensulfuron methyl resulted in no observable above-sediment hydrilla biomass 1 yr after application of the product. Hydrilla was also eliminated 1 yr after application from another lake treated once with 100 ppb bensulfuron methyl, and lake volume occupied by hydrilla remained less than 5% of pretreatment levels in this lake 2 yr after application. In a third lake, 40-ppb bensulfulron methyl eliminated hydrilla biomass for the period of a growing season. In the fourth lake application of 25 ppb bensulfuron methyl resulted in a small reduction in biomass, and vigorous growth was evident 11 months after application. Mariner was applied to this lake again to target 50 ppb bensulfuron methyl, and hydrilla biomass approached zero 1 yr following the second application. Hydrilla tuber density was reduced in all lakes where Mariner was applied and tuber density was measured. However, even after large reductions in tuber numbers, high tuber density (up to 300/sq m) remained in the hydrosoil of two lakes and tubers were not eliminated from any of the lakes.																			0146-6623					JAN	1993	31						175	178																WOS:A1993MU07900039

Females of the fleas Dinopsyllus lypusus Jordan & Rothschild, Ctenophthalmus calceatus cabirus Jordan & Rothschild, and Xenopsylla cheopis bantorum Jordan infested more grass rats and in greater numbers than did males. Phoretic hypopi (heteromorphic deutonymphs) of two species of mites, Psylloglyphus uilenbergi Fain and Paraceroglyphus xenopsylla Fain & Schwan, varied seasonally in their abundance on fleas and utilized female fleas over male fleas for their major source of transport. Additionally, the mites were very host specific with nearly 100% of those identified on D. lypusus and C. calceatus cabirus being P. uilenbergi and 89% of the mites identified on X. cheopis bantorum being P. xenopsylla. This level of specificity suggests that these mite-flea associations are highly evolved. The importance of female fleas as hosts for transporting mites also suggests that female-biased sex ratios of fleas on their hosts may be caused, in part, by females being more important as dispersers within flea populations.																			0022-2585	1938-2928				JAN	1993	30	1					122	135		10.1093/jmedent/30.1.122	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmedent/30.1.122								8433319					WOS:A1993KJ31500016

(sage pondweed) is presented to analyze the implications of resource allocation for longterm survival. The model is calibrated on field observations of P. pectinatus. The model is simple and can be used as a tool to improve understanding of the dominant mechanisms in resource allocation and long-term survival. The model is used to test the hypothesis that the resource allocation to the tubers at lower photon flux density increases and that, consequently, sloughing of the vegetation is enhanced. Simulations indicate that the increased resource allocation to the tubers under low photon flux density can explain the observed biomass development and tuber bank size adequately at various light conditions in Lake Veluwe in The Netherlands. Only at the highest shading was the calculated production much lower than the actual production. Apparently, other mechanisms, such as an increase in photosynthesis with increased tuber formation, are involved. An increase in the resource allocation to tuber production under low photon flux density led to a lower biomass of the vegetation during the growing season, but seems an appropriate strategy in terms of reproductive output and long-term survival of the population.																			0146-6623					JAN	1993	31						128	134																WOS:A1993MU07900029

Historical development of the cypress/tupelo swamp at Horseshoe Lake, Alexander County, Illinois, USA	WETLANDS												Horseshoe Lake, Alexander County, Illinois, is a shallow floodplain lake that lies at the northern range boundary of Taxodium distichum var. distichum (L.) L.C. Rich (bald cypress) in the Mississippi River Valley. About 35% of the lake surface is occupied by a flooded forest of Taxodium distichum and Nyssa aquatica L. (water tupelo). Pollen in two sediment cores was examined to determine the time of arrival of the forest at the site. Taxodium and Nyssa pollen increased in sediment deposited in 1850. The Modem Analogue Technique (MAT) showed that samples dating from before the arrival of Taxodium were most similar to sites in a variety of locations with high Quercus (oak) and Carya (hickory) and low Pinus (pine) percentages without Taxodium. For sediment deposited after the increase in Taxodium, the most similar modern analogues came from TaxodiumINyssa swamps in the lower Mississippi River Valley and Virginia. Ring analysis of extant trees suggested an increase in reproduction and growth after 1850. The MAT results were consistent with the hypothesis that the TaxodiumlNyssa forest first colonized the lake around 1850 when American farmers developed the upland loess soils of the watershed for agriculture. We suggest that agricultural development on the uplands surrounding the lake encouraged the growth of the TaxodiumINyssa forest by increasing sedimentation rate and producing large shallow areas of seasonally flooded eroded material.

J	Someth, P; Kubo, N; Tanji, H				Someth, Paradis; Kubo, Naritaka; Tanji, Hajime			A combined technique of floodplain storage and reservoir irrigation for paddy rice cultivation	PADDY AND WATER ENVIRONMENT												This paper introduces an irrigation system developed in the floodplain of a lake and studies the water management technique of the irrigation system by estimating the total water balance of the whole system. The system is characterized by a reservoir combined with a dike system in the floodplain of the Tonle Sap Great Lake and an irrigation system. Two main models are used for calculating the total water balance. The first model is the water balance of the reservoir. The inputs to the model are water level of the reservoir, precipitation, lake evaporation, infiltration, and area-volume curve of the reservoir. The outputs are inflow and outflow of the reservoir. The supply from the reservoir to paddy fields is computed from the outflow. The second model is the water balance of paddy fields, based on which the water requirement in paddy fields is derived. The reference evapotranspiration needed to calculate the water requirement is simulated for monthly time series using the FAO Penman-Monteith model. Since there is no drainage network in the irrigation system, surface drainage and runoff are not included in the calculation of the water balance, and seepage is considered negligible in the flat floodplain area. The evapotranspiration, rice variety, soil type and irrigated area are used to simulate water consumption in paddy fields. Finally, the two models are connected to produce the total water balance from the reservoir to paddy fields. The total outflow from the reservoir is estimated and the total water consumption for dry season cultivation is also determined. Finally, the efficiency of the whole system is examined.																			1611-2490	1611-2504				JUN	2007	5	2					101	112		10.1007/s10333-007-0068-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10333-007-0068-8													WOS:000208366500005

Growth rates were based on sizes at the beginning and end of each marine year and adjusted according to seasonal changes in environmental temperature. Temperature effects were derived from information on growth responses of cultured fish. Mortality estimates were based on a model which equates mortality rate to an inverse function of weight. Monthly sizes determined from the growth model were substituted into the mortality model, together with estimates of smolt and adult runs (catch plus escapement), to examine the population dynamics of an average Babine Lake smolt cohort. Using these predictions we suggest that 90% of natural mortality occurred during the first 4 mo at sea.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				MAY	1986	43	5					999	1004		10.1139/f86-123	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f86-123													WOS:A1986C049200009

P. phoxinus, the minnow, was the numerically dominant species, forming 60% of the catch. The minnows reached 50.9 mm fork-length by their 2nd birthday, which was the age of 1st maturity. The sexes did not differ significantly either in length or numbers in the 1st 3 age-classes. Few males survived to their 4th birthday and the oldest fish, and 5 yr, was a female. In prespawning females the number and diameter of ripe eggs was positively correlated with body size. Some females still contained ripe eggs on July 15, 50 days after the 1st spent females had been captured. Analysis of the changes in egg numbers in the gonads over this period indicates that each female ripens and sheds several batches of eggs over the spawning season. Nemacheilus barbatulus formed 28% of the catch and was the most evenly and widely distributed fish in the littoral zone, occurring at all 18 sites; the minnow was common at the sites with the largest rocks. Eight other species, of which Cottus gobio, Perca fluviatilis, Lota lota and Gymnocephalus cernua were the most abundant, formed the remaining 12% of the catch. Zippin population estimates gave a total fish density of 1.75/m2; the total biomass was 4.78 g/m2. The main contributors to biomass were N. barbatulus 51%, Phoxinus P. phoxinus 31% and juvenile L. lota 13%. The annual production of N. barbatulus was 1.43 g/m2 and that of P. phoxinus 0.96 g/m2.

Stickleback eggs were present in the stomachs of 23 and 11% of al sticklebacks sampled from the field in 1982 and 1985 respectively. On average, males consumed more eggs than did females. Seasonal egg consumption increased with increases in stickleback density in breeding colonies. In experimental enclosure studies, nest densities varied between 0 and 3 .cntdot. m-2 as stickleback numbers were manipulated from 1.5 to 12 .cntdot. m-2. Peak nest densities occurred at 5.8 fish .cntdot. m-2. Stickleback density explained 70-86% of the variation in nest numbers in an application of a Ricker stock-recruit model and weekly rates of nest survival exhibited strong density dependence. Our evidence indicates that both nest raiding and egg cannibalism are important in limiting the production of stickleback fry as population density inreases in scattered, lakeshore, breeding colonies of Kennedy Lake.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				MAR	1989	46	3					372	383		10.1139/f89-049	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f89-049													WOS:A1989T558000001

The chemical stability of VeraOH and its application as peroxidase substrate was tested under light and dark conditions, different hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentrations and humic matter contents. VeraOH was stable under low UV radiation at in situ conditions in lake water (<0.010...0.25 kJ m(-2) d(-1)), laboratory conditions (<0.05...0.30 kJ m(-2) d(-1)), and low (1...100 mu M) H2O2 concentrations. However, peroxides oxidized VeraOH above 1...10 mM H2O2 concentration in sterile Millipore-Q and humic lake water. Dark incubations showed little VeraOH oxidation products. The developed peroxidase assay was tested in the growth medium of Phanerochaete chrysosporium and a bacteria isolate (P.M.D. 20.4.3.1) from mesohumic lake Paajarvi. Peroxidase activities were also measured in natural microbial communities under standard laboratory and under in situ conditions in humic lake water. Incubation times of about 5 to 12 days were usually needed to record significant (P < 0.05) peroxidase activities in lake waters. In situ peroxidase activities varied in pelagial surface water (0...0.5 m) on a seasonal scale between 74 nmol L-1 h(-1) and 273 nmol L-1 h(-1) (mean: 176 nmol L-1 h(-1)) and within the water column between 110 nmol L-1 h(-1) and 800 nmol L-1 h(-1) (mean: 500 nmol L-1 h(-1)) in polyhumic lake Mekkojarvi.																			0323-4320					MAY	1998	26	3					158	166																WOS:000074099800006

The trials were conducted at two field sites representative of a large land area in the Lake Chad Basin of Africa. Water was clearly the limiting factor as grain yield response to two irrigations (10 cm total) was a statistically significant 58% over 3 years. One irrigation during vegetative growth resulted in sorghum grain yield increases of 24-29%. Response to P fertilizer was negligible. Response to N fertilizer was 32% over three environments but was not statistically significant at P<0.05. Future research should focus on improvements in soil moisture availability, either through increased soil moisture storage or through reduced evaporative losses.

Kokanee were recorded on echograms as school echoes in the daytime and as numerous individual echoes in the nighttime. Their swimming layer changes seasonally in accordance with the depth change of thermocline in the lake. Kokanee also have a diurnal behavioral pattern. Namely, they form schools after sunrise and they disperse after sunset. The shifting process from individuals to schools or from schools to individuals is strongly related to illuminance, and it takes 50 minutes at sunrise and sunset for the change to occur. The swimming speed of kokanee in the daytime is faster than that in the nighttime, and the fastest speed of the day occurs at twilight. Average swimming speeds were estimated to be 57 cm/s in the twilight, 48 cm/s in the daytime and 20 cm/s in the nighttime periods, respectively.

Depending on season, water in forested wetlands can be warm, stagnant, and oxygen-depleted, yet may support high fish diversity. Fish assemblages in forested wetlands are not well studied because of difficulties in sampling heavily structured environments. During the April-July period, we surveyed and compared the water quality and assemblages of small fish in a margin wetland (forested fringe along a lake shore), contiguous wetland (forested wetland adjacent to a lake), and the open water of an oxbow lake. Dissolved-oxygen levels measured hourly 0.5 m below the surface were higher in the open water than in either of the forested wetlands. Despite reduced water quality, fish-species richness and catch rates estimated with light traps were greater in the forested wetlands than in the open water. The forested wetlands supported large numbers of fish and unique fish assemblages that included some rare species, likely because of their structural complexity. Programs developed to refine agricultural practices, preserve riparian zones, and restore lakes should include guidance to protect and reestablish forest ed wetlands.

In most cases, Florida individuals matured more rapidly and had larger body sizes and clutch sizes than Michigan individuals over a range of temperature from 15 to 30.degree. C. The greatly reduced fecundity and longer maturation time of the Michign population relative to the Florida population at 15.degree. C may reflect adaptations to different temperature regimes encountered by these geographically distant populations. Genotype-environment interactions were observed for body size, but not for maturation time or clutch size. Some local variation was evident in both the Michigan and Florida locales, indicating that forces operating on a local scale may result in substantial variation that is superimposed upon any broad scale, geographic patterns. Selection for short maturation time and large clutch size is hypothesized to have occurred in the Thonotosassa population, which is exposed to heavy fish predation and high food levels. The small bodies and clutches in the Douglas population, which experiences chronically low food levels, may reflect selection to minimize energy demands where food is scare.																			0006-3185	1939-8697				APR	1986	170	2					279	295		10.2307/1541809	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1541809													WOS:A1986C056900010
J	CHARLTON, MN				CHARLTON, MN			LAKE ERIE OXYGEN REVISITED	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The problem of predicting the future hypolimnion oxygen regime in Lake Erie from past records is reassessed. Instead of comparing oxygen depletion rates, the data were manipulated to reveal comparable concentrations at the end of August each year. By removing confusion caused by variable concentrations at the beginning of stratification, the expected change of 0-2 mg/L from the 1950s to present was revealed. The oxygen regime of the east basin has changed little if at all; the year-to-year variability being as large as possible trends in concentration. A water sampling device used in the earliest samplings was found to produce incorrect samples under certain conditions, thereby lessening confidence in the early data. The trajectory of oxygen concentration after stratification is independent of epilimnion productivity. It is proposed that oxygen depletion depends on average trophic conditions proceeding each stratified season. Modestly improved O2 concentrations can be expected with, periodically, low concentrations due to lake levels and weather after nutrient loading reductions. The lag of O2 response to loading reductions is at least 10 years. Lag phenomena may have prevented full O2 response to loading increases.																			0380-1330						1987	13	4					697	708		10.1016/S0380-1330(87)71684-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(87)71684-0													WOS:A1987M110000023

Physical modelling of a high energy coastal lake outflow, Canterbury, New Zealand	OCEAN ENGINEERING												A 1:50 scale laboratory physical model was constructed to simulate canal outflows from Wairewa/Lake Forsyth, Canterbury, New Zealand, in order to assess the propensity for canal blockage due to beach sediment transport. A terrestrial survey, depth soundings and side scan sonar surveys were carried out to establish baseline topographic data. These data were used to derive a high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) of the area. Profiles derived from the DEM were used to cut metal guides to represent beach topography. These were placed in the model tank and a beach was shaped of fine, silica sand to represent the area of the canal opening. Canal outflows were simulated using flow through a polystyrene channel with a rectangular cross-section. A thin-plate wave generator was built for simulating waves. The model was initially designed to simulate sediment transport by longshore drift from south-westerly swells but was later adapted to also simulate south-south-easterly swells. Testing was carried out simulating the base conditions with and without the existing groyne configuration. The model simulated sediment movement well under these conditions. The effectiveness of five groyne scenarios in maintaining a permanent canal opening was tested. Swells from both the SW and the SSE were simulated. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	JACKSON, MB				JACKSON, MB			THE DOMINANT ATTACHED FILAMENTOUS ALGAE OF GEORGIAN BAY, THE NORTH CHANNEL AND EASTERN LAKE HURON - FIELD ECOLOGY AND BIOMONITORING POTENTIAL DURING 1980	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Field investigations during the ice-period of 1980 confirm that the dominant attached filamentous algae in the Canadian waters of Lake Huron are the green algae Ulothrix zonata and Cladophora glomerata, and the red alga Bangia atropurpurea. It is believed that nutrient availability limits the distribution of these algae, while temperature controls their seasonal periodicity. Because of favourable physical characteristics, the study area represents a vast potential habitat for attached filamentous algae. It is expected that eastern Georgian Bay, in particular, will suffer significant environmental degradation from the growth of Cladophora unless existing phosphorus levels are maintained indefinitely (i.e., < 0.005 mg total P1-1). Attached filamentous algae accumulate (103 to 105 .times.) a variety of elements primarily in proportion to availability in the surrounding water. The occurrence of maximum algal metal concentrations at municipal waste water outfalls, river mouths and harbour areas (e.g., in .mu.gg-1, Cr 29.0, Cu 46.4, Ni 34.0, Pb 55.0) is indicative of discrete source loadings while elevated levels at remote sites in eastern Georgian Bay (e.g., in .mu.g g-1, Cr 12.0 - 15.5, Cu 18.0, Ni 15.0-16.0 Pb 8.5-8.8) are suggestive of generalized loadings from the Canadian Shield, possibly due to the effects of acidic precipitation.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN 20	1988	163						149	171		10.1007/BF00026927	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00026927													WOS:A1988P512800013

The interrelations between TOC and chlorophyll a in different studied sites (in macrophyte communities as well as in open water sections) were also taken into account. In November 2000, March, May, June and July 200 1, water samples were collected in two transects along and across the take traversing macrophyte communities of the phytolittoral zonation (7 sites) and reaching the open water zone (mid-lake, 3 sites) and, additionally, in a site close to a beach attracting local inhabitants and tourists. Statistical analyses revealed significant temporal differentiation and reverse patterns of changes of both TOC and chlorophyll a concentrations in the studied lake, whereas the spatial one was not significant. No correlations between both parameters were found. The results of cluster analyses suggest macrophyte vegetation and its seasonal changes in development as the main factor to influence TOC concentrations.					; Niedzielski, Przemyslaw/A-6316-2009; Pełechaty, Mariusz/HDN-8393-2022	Niedzielski, Przemyslaw/0000-0002-2787-9057; Pelechata, Aleksandra/0000-0002-7487-8348; Pelechaty, Mariusz/0000-0002-4075-6561													1230-1485						2003	12	5					607	611																WOS:000185850800011

All of these species died within six hours when confronted by totally anoxic conditions, but all survived four days at oxygen saturation levels as low as 25%. Males succumbed to the effects of anoxia more rapidly than the larger females of each species, and larger species survived for shorter periods than smaller species. In artificially stratified columns, where the lower layer was anoxic, all four species displayed an upward migratory response towards oxygenated conditions. Where the artificial hypolimnion was hypoxic, however the migratory response was not observed. The results suggest that some benthic copepods cope with seasonal anoxia in eutrophic stratified lakes by migration rather than the various physiological adaptations shown by planktonic and semi-planktonic species.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1985	127	3					257	263		10.1007/BF00024230	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00024230													WOS:A1985ARF1600008

The chlorophyll-a content in deeper zones varied from vertical stratification to de-stratification during the study period. A higher frequency of occurrence for changes between high and low chlorophyll-a values was found in the middle area of the reservoir compared to the border area. The magnitude of high/low values also differed seasonally and geographically. The reason for the variation of chlorophyll-a in the reservoir was found as a complex result of the influence of water level, nutrients, water depth, temperature, and light as potential factors. The results indicate that the mixing effect triggered by inflow and other hydraulic conditions is one of the important factors influencing temporal and spatial variations of the chlorophyll-a content in the reservoir.					dingguo, pan/GZK-7068-2022														1863-0650	1863-0669				NOV	2015	43	11					1481	1487		10.1002/clen.201400869	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/clen.201400869													WOS:000366084900005

Radiation dose rates decreased exponentially with water depth down to a depth of 1 m above the bottom sediment. In the water near the sediment, the dose rate increased with depth owing to the emission of gamma-rays from natural radionuclides in the sediment.

Bottom temperature monitoring in Lake Baikal	RUSSIAN GEOLOGY AND GEOPHYSICS												We report results of bottom temperature monitoring of 2003-2004 in the deepwater South Baikal basin (Lake Baikal) near active gas-fluid methane vents at lake depths of 1020 and 1350 m. Sediments and water temperatures were measured using an autonomous temperature recorder designed at the Institute of Geophysics (Novosibirsk). Experiments implied short-duration recording and pioneering continuous 350 day-long monitoring near the Staryi vent. Measurements within a I m thick layer above and below the bottom showed notable variations in water (up to 0.07 degrees C) and sediment temperatures and in geothermal gradient. The long temperature records include a relatively steady period (mid-June 2003-early February 2004) with smooth temperature variations (especially in sediments) and two transient unsteady periods. The steady season is the best time for heat flow studies in the South Baikal basin. The 0.04-0.05 degrees C drop in bottom water temperature during the unsteady periods may result from intrusion of cold surface water. A positive temperature anomaly of similar to 0.04 degrees C recorded in April 2003 may be caused, among other reasons, by active gas venting. (c) 2007, IGM, Siberian Branch of the RAS.

The present paper uses a probabilistic utility index based on Kolmogorov-Smirnov formulae for discriminating high versus low variability in watershed mean areal precipitation and temperature and watershed-outlet discharge in the Korean Peninsula on the basis of climate model simulations of high versus low nodal surface precipitation and temperature.

In this study, for the first time, single and ensemble simulations from four atmospheric general circulation models with grid box areas ranging from 200 x 200 km(2) to 400 x 500 km(2) and with varying physical parameterizations and sea surface temperature forcing (observed versus persisted) are used to discriminate concurrent extreme values of the observed watershed variables in watersheds with largest area of approximately 26,000 km(2). The analysis is done for a variety of periods and temporal resolutions. Monte Carlo simulations are employed to identify values of the utility index that are significant at the 5% level in each case. The utility index is computed for standardized anomalies of the variables of interest. The utility analysis shows that climate simulations have significant potential value for all watersheds in the Korean Peninsula especially for water resources management applications that use watershed mean areal temperature. The study also shows that several climate models are potentially useful in various seasons for discriminating extremes in watershed mean areal. precipitation and watershed-outlet discharge for the Korean watersheds. Although single climate model simulations would be useful, the character of the results suggests that multi-model ensembles would be particularly useful for water resources management applications.

Biotic and abiotic compartments were periodically sampled to measure Se-75 concentrations throughout the 318-d experiment. The biotic compartments were periphyton, rooted pondweed (Elodea canadensis), snails (Helisoma sp.), and mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis). Results show that the uptake rates in the biotic compartments for Se-75-selenomethionine were at least an order of magnitude greater than for Se-75-selenite. However, elimination rates for respective biotic compartments were similar. Seasonal sediment Se-75 concentrations in both ponds decreased simultaneously with increases in Se-75 concentrations within biotic compartments. This suggests that sediment is a secondary source of Se-75 rather than a sink in some shallow freshwater systems.																			0049-6979					MAR	1992	62	1-2					25	42		10.1007/BF00478451	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00478451													WOS:A1992HE15900003

Daphnia laevis was the dominant herbivore, while Diaphanosoma birgei, Notodiaptomus carteri, and Thermocyclops minutus were also permanently present. 73% of all correlations found for different species and population parameters were delayed. When Daphnia was abundant in December-January, its population was controlled by predation of a water mite Piona sp., nannoplankton concentration, and its own interference. Other crustaceans were suppressed at that time by Daphnia interference and by netplankton. A bloom of filamentous cyanobacteria appeared in March after Daphnia declined in numbers due to predation by the water mite and a fish Moenkhausia intermedia. The bloom probably caused further Daphnia decline and promoted a rise in numbers of small Cladocera. During Daphnia depression, other crustaceans, more immune to fish and cyanobacteria, were controlled by stimulating effects of nannoplankton and inhibition by netplankton. Fish impact upon cladocerans, the most preferred food, was not elevated during periods of full moon. No signs of the influence on crustaceans by a predatory Chaoborus were found. The observed succession of planktonic events conformed to the model described for north-temperate lakes and was in fact the succession of biotic interactions.

J	Wright, D; Danks, M; Lawrenz, R				Wright, D; Danks, M; Lawrenz, R			Impact of a protective limestone treatment on the water chemistry and zooplankton community of Thrush Lake, Minnesota	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												A limestone slurry was sprayed on the surface of Thrush Lake, a small headwater lake in northeastern Minnesota, to test a treatment designed to protect acid-sensitive waters from anthropogenic acidification. The 6-year study, consisting of pretreatment, transition, and post-treatment phases, was part of the four-state Acid Precipitation Mitigation Program directed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Measured water-chemistry parameters, including acid-neutralizing capacity, pH, dissolved calcium, and dissolved inorganic carbon, increased following treatment, although local climatic conditions influenced the magnitude and duration of the chemical changes. Physical changes to the lake, other than an increase in conductivity and a short-term alteration of water clarity subsequent to treatment, were not documented. The composition of the zooplankton community was altered, with the proportion of rotifers increasing after treatment. Individual zooplankton species showed a variety of changes in abundance that were associated with treatment over both seasonal and multi-year intervals. For example, Holopedium gibberum was absent from lake samples immediately following treatment and recovered within a season, whereas Diaptomus minutus and Keratella taurocephala populations were reduced after treatment and had not recovered by the end of the study. Alternately, Asplanchna priodonta increased in abundance after treatment. These observed abundance patterns were generally consistent with previous acidification or base-addition studies. In contrast, the changes in community composition of zooplankton did not consistently fit patterns developed from regional studies across water-chemistry gradients. These differences emphasize the importance of biotic as well at; abiotic factors in controlling zooplankton community composition.																			1061-2971	1526-100X				SEP	1996	4	3					293	306		10.1111/j.1526-100X.1996.tb00181.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1526-100X.1996.tb00181.x													WOS:A1996VJ21600009

Some species showed a differentiated swarming phenology as well as diurnal activity patterns, although swarming was usually most pronounced at dusk. Swarming activity of the species also showed small differences in sensitivity to wind velocity, temperature and illumination intensity. In Mystacides azurea there was a tendency for unmated females to approach the male swarms earlier in the evenings swarming periods than did the mated ones, probably because mated females alternate their activity their activity between egglaying and mating. The number of observed pair formations was correlated with the number of swarming males, indicating that males had their activity peak when the number of receptive females was highest. Emerging adults of M. azurea and males of Athripsodes Aterrimus showed a significant seasonal decline in body size (wing length).

Morrison sediments are distributed over more than 1 million km2 in the western USA and represent a mosaic of riverine, lacustrine and floodplain environments developed on a vast alluvial plain nourished by debris from the ancestral Rocky Mountains. Plant productivity must have been reasonably high to support abundant large-bodied herbivores, but the absence of coals, scarcity of small aquatic vertebrates, the abundance of oxidized sediments and presence of calcretes lead us to believe that water was periodically in short supply. A strongly seasonal climate may have necessitated annual large-scale movements of large herbivores, accounting in part for their remarkably broad and uniform geographic distribution. Dinosaur diversity is lower in the Morrison than in the Late Cretaceous, and taphonomic alteration is higher. Massed accumulations of thousands of bones are characteristic of the Morrison. Morrison dinosaurs were not confined to specific depositional environments but were distributed across the complete spectrum of available habitats, from lakes to dry floodplains; this type of distribution is similar to that of large terrestrial mammals such as elephants and rhinos and is different from that of hippos and crocodiles. Common Morrison taxa were Camarasaurus, Apatosaurus, Diplodocus, Allosaurus and Stegosaurus; these genera probably constituted a true dinosaur community. Stegosaurus may have been partially segregated from the other genera and Camptosaurus more strongly so. Camarasaurus and Diplodocus were gregarious, with juveniles and subadults of the former particularly common; Apatosaurus was less abundant and more solitary in its habits. Juveniles and subadults are known for a number of dinosaurs.

(2) Within a cohort of a species, the seasonal patterns of change in density, biomass and growth were similar within and outside the exclosures. With the exceptions of E. octoculata and H. stagnalis in the second year of the study, reproductive effort differed between control and experimental sites, being greater in situations where densities of leeches, proportions of mature leeches and cocoons/eggs per mature leech were higher. (3) Mortality of young leeches was high with 86-98% of E. octoculata and 85-94% of H. stagnalis dying within 2-3 months of recruitment, and from 88 to 97% of G. complanata dying within 3-4 months. (4) When recruitment rates within and outside the experimental areas were similar, subsequent mortality rates of leeches were similar; when recruitment was higher, either in control or experimental sites, then the subsequent mortality rate was also higher. It is concluded that vertebrate predation does not make a major contribution to leech mortality. (5) Densities of potential invertebrate predators within and outside the exclosures did not differ significantly, and predation pressure from these would not account for the observed differential mortality of leeches. Previous field work by the authors has indicated a very low incidence of predation on lake-dwelling leeches, and it is estimated that predation by fish and invertebrates accounts for 13, 5 and 4% of the mortality of E. octoculata, H. stagnalis and G. complanata recruited annually in the study lake.																			0021-8790	1365-2656				FEB	1987	56	1					131	146		10.2307/4804	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/4804													WOS:A1987F944200010
J	Tsai, CW; Tian, GL; Chiu, CY				Tsai, Chih-Wei; Tian, Guanglong; Chiu, Chih-Yu			Great fraction of dissolved organic C and N in the primary per-humid Chamaecyparis forest soil	BOTANICAL STUDIES												Background: Labile organic matter plays a crucial role in a variety of forest functions, however, our understanding to its quality and quantity across various forests is limited, particularly primary forests. We investigated soil labile C and N (i.e. microbial biomass C and N, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON), associated ammonium, and nitrate) at three topographic locations (i.e. summit, footslope and lakeshore) in a primary Chamaecyparis forest of Taiwan. The following hypotheses are tested in this study: (1) This undisturbed Chamaecyparis forest shows the great size of soil labile C and N; (2) there is an evident topographic effect on the distribution of soil labile C and N and the associated inorganic N over seasons. Results: Fulfilling with our first hypothesis, the considerable size of labile C and N in this forest soil was quantified. Abundant C availability and the acidity of soils in this forest favoured ammonium production over nitrate. The undisturbed environment with per-humid and acidic soil was linked to the high concentrations of soil DOC and DON as the dominant form in N dynamics. In contrast to our second hypothesis, topographic effects on soil labile C and N were generally not evident, suggesting the homogeneous soil environment across various topographic locations in this Chamaecyparis forest. Conclusions: This study illustrates the sustainable importance of primary montane forests for being sources of DOC and DON.

Volumetric expression of gross primary productivity was more strongly correlated with chlorophyll a and nutrient concentrations than was areal expression. Primary production in clearwater (< 75 Pt units) lakes was more predictable than colored (> 75 Pt units) lakes. Areal production in Florida lakes was intermediate to the tropical and temperate regions, although volumetric productivity during the vegetative season (May-September) was not significantly different from temperate zone lakes for the same period. Predictive abilities of empirical equations describing primary productivity in Florida lakes are improved by distinguishing colored and clear lakes.

A high concentration of net algal forms is discussed as a selectively working factor, modifying the final results of competition between the more and the less efficient filter feeding species in the lake [in Poland].																			0070-9557						1977	25	2					179	225																WOS:A1977EE41300001

Space limitation depending on density of the above ground biomass and growth limitation due to shortage in belowground biomass were introduced. Seasonal changes in eelgrass production, both above and below ground, have been simulated as functions of the external forcing variables light, water temperature, wind-generated water movements and internal control variables due to aging of the plant material. The vertical distribution of eelgrass can be partly explained from modelling results on space, light and belowground biomass limitations. Together with additional data-not used in the model-on seed production and growth of eelgrass shoots from seeds, vertical and horizontal distributions can be explained satisfactorily.																			0171-8630	1616-1599					1983	10	2					187	195		10.3354/meps010187	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps010187													WOS:A1983PW73800010

Effects of gut content on δ15N, δ13C and C:N of the macroinvertebrate Mysis diluviana	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Stable isotopes have become a popular method for studying aquatic food webs. Lack of laboratory studies and standardized methods, however, may limit the application and interpretation of stable isotope analysis. One procedure applied inconsistently among stable isotope studies for whole body and bulk invertebrate samples is gut evacuation after capture. We evaluated the importance of gut evacuation prior to stable isotope analysis in the omnivorous macroinvertebrate Mysis diluviana. Mysis ranging from 9 to 20 mm were fed a diet of Anemia for 58 days in the laboratory. Following this acclimation period, Mysis with empty guts, full guts of Artemia, and full guts of green algae (Scenedesmus obliquus) were processed for stable isotope analysis of delta N-15, delta C-13 and C:N. We found no significant difference among gut content treatments for any of these metrics. We conclude that gut evacuation is an unnecessary step in stable isotope analysis of Mysis in the size range we investigated. (C) 2015 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

J	Kim, J				Kim, Jinkeun			Manganese treatment to reduce black water occurrence in the water supply	ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH												26 multi-regional water treatment plants (WTPs) were investigated, to determine the characteristics of manganese (Mn) concentration and removal in Korea. Mn concentrations of raw water in most WTPs were higher than the drinking water standard (i.e., 0.05 mg/L); thus, proper removal of Mn at the WTPs is needed. Mn concentration was generally higher in lakes than rivers due to seasonal lake turnovers. The Mn concentrations of treated water at 26 WTPs in 2012 were less than 0.05 mg/L, due to strict law enforcement and water treatment processes optimization. However, before 2010, those concentrations were more than 0.05 mg/L, which could have led to an accumulation of Mn oxides in the distribution system. This could be one of the main reasons for black water occurrence. Therefore, regular monitoring of Mn concentration in the distribution system, flushing, and proper Mn removal at WTPs are needed, to supply clean and palatable tap water.																			1226-1025	2005-968X				SEP	2015	20	3					230	236		10.4491/eer.2015.003	http://dx.doi.org/10.4491/eer.2015.003													WOS:000422805100004

Short-term peaks in water flow were generated for the purpose of the operation of a whitewater slalom canoeing track built just downstream of the dam. In 2002, the reservoir was drawn down. The patterns in habitat samples were recognized with a Kohonen's unsupervised artificial neural network (SOM). The SOM spatial gradient was stronger than the SOM temporal gradient, which shows that the removal of the studied dam did not have a destructive impact on habitats' features, as shown in other studies, and that the patchy nature of the riverbed has been maintained. The complete emptying of the Drzewieckie Lake took place at the beginning of the vegetation season, which allowed plants to cover the exposed bottom of the reservoir and, consequently, reduce the downstream flow of organic matter accumulated there. Patterns in the displacement of aquatic macrophytes, inorganic substratum and different fractions of particulate organic matter are discussed. The amount of dissolved oxygen decreased because of the lack of intensive water discharge from the reservoir into the river, which would result in high water turbulence. Results of this study are important for planning the ecologically sound dam removals.					; Tszydel, Mariusz/HNB-7988-2023	Kruk, Andrzej/0000-0003-1452-7906; Tszydel, Mariusz/0000-0002-0254-7451; 													1730-413X	1897-3191				SEP	2015	44	3					410	425		10.1515/ohs-2015-0038	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/ohs-2015-0038													WOS:000362232100012

These nuclides were also determined in stream drainage area soils and bedrock. From these measurements and hydrological data, an estimate of the annual supply of these nuclides to Lake 239 at the Experimental Lakes Area (ELA) was made. Because of low concentrations of major ions, suspended sediments, and low pH, many common stream transport mechanisms for these nuclides are not available, and we propose that dissolved organic carbon is important in this respect. The annual flux (per unit stream drainage area) of these nuclides to the lake is similar to fluxes calculated for larger rivers of the world. Uranium-234 is transported preferentially to 238U at activity ratios of 1-1.3. Radium-226 is carried in solution in proportion to Ca++. The major supply of 210Pb to the lake is from atmospheric fallout on the lake surface area. There are insufficient 222Rn or 210Pb deficits in the soil profiles to balance the measured excess 210Pb in surface soils and lake sediments. Partition coefficients for these nuclides were calculated from data on stream suspended sediments and stream water; U and Ra coefficients were .apprxeq. 104, and Th, 210Pb, and 210Po coefficients were 104 to 105.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1987	44			1			215	230		10.1139/f87-297	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f87-297													WOS:A1987L149200022

Surface water showed time patterns of nor-carotinoids, aldehydes, alkanes and octatriene-isomers, which in most cases can clearly be attributed to specific phytoplankton populations. The variety of substances produced by algae was highest in the mesotrophic lake, because as compared to its previous hypertrophic state, restoration has caused an increase in phytoplankton species diversity as well as a more rapid seasonal succession of species. Contrary to expectations, serious odor problems occurred only at this lake, due to Chrysophyceae not found in hypertrophic waters. Therefore it is concluded that further reduction of phosphate concentrations is necessary, if not only the blue-green algae, but also the the Chrysophyte populations are to be reduced below nuisance levels. However, for the purpose of gaining drinking water from surface water, slow bank filtrations showed to be an effective measure for the elimination of terpenoids, ocatrienes and alkane molecules larger than dodecane; therefore it can be recommended as a treatment against odor problems in drinking water gained from surface waters.

The lake had a mean phytoplankton biomass of 34 mg chl a m-3 (n = 14). The seasonal variation in phytoplankton biomass of the euphotic zone (mg chl a m-2 h-1) was muted with a CV (standard deviation/mean) of 31%. The vertical distribution of photosynthetic activity was of a typical pattern for phytoplankton with light inhibition on all but overcast days. The maximum specific rates of photosynthesis of photosynthetic capacity (Omax) for the lake approached 19 mg O2 (mg chl a)-1 h-1, with high values during periods of low photoplankton biomass. Areal rates of photosynthesis ranged between 0.30 to 0.73 g O2 m-2 h-1 and 3.3 to 7.8 g O2 m-2 d-1. The efficiency of utilisation of PhAR incident on the lake surface varied from 2.4 to 4.1 mmol E-1 with the highest efficiency observed corresponding to the lowest surface radiation. Calculated on a caloric basis, the efficiency ranged between 1.7 and 2.9%.

Healthy green charophytes, bearing oogonia, are frequently observed at salinities approximately 1-2 times that of seawater. Field observations of salinity tolerance are confirmed by experiments which demonstrate photosynthetic 14C CO2 fixation at these salinities. The lakes containing these charophytes have various hydrological settings but are all influenced by inputs of continental groundwater of seasonally varying salinity. Different evaporite minerals are deposited depending upon local desiccation-evaporation balances. In coastal lagoons adjacent to the Coorong, charophytes are found associated with calcite, aragonite and protodolomite while in the continental lakes around northern Spencer Gulf the observed associations are with gypsum and halite. Lake deposits containing charophyte oogonia and discoidal gypsum provide a recent analog for some ancient evaporite units which are not adequately explained by the arid, coastal marine evaporite model based on the present-day Persian Gulf sabkhas. For example, the Purbeckian evaporites of Dorset (England) and the Tertiary evaporites of the Paris Basin (France) both contain charophyte- and evaporite-bearing units which are similar to the deposits of these Recent Australian lakes. We suggest that sediments containing associations of charophyte oogonia and evaporites formed as a result of seasonally varying salinity within lakes of the semi-arid, Mediterranean-type, climatic zone.

Air samples were collected in stainless steel canisters and analyzed by gas chromatography, with a FID detector. A distinct seasonal variation has been found, with much higher emissions during the wet season, and comparatively lower emissions during the dry season, but with large variability. Individual fluxes had variations from less than 1 to 1,389 mgCH(4)m(-2)d(-1). The average for the period of high fluxes, from October to April was 238 +/- 238 mgCh(4)m(-2)d(-1), and for the period of lower fluxes, from May to September, the average was 7 +/- 14 mgCH(4)m(-2)d(-1). Methane fluxes were correlated with the precipitation in the region, but with a poor statistics.

The slope 'b' for females for the length-weight relationship was between 1.239 and 3.560 while that for the males was between 1.454 and 2.946. The growth was allometric in both cases and were significantly different from the expected value of 3. The condition factor for females was highest in March 1997 (1.1449 +/- 0.1787) and lowest in January (0.8638 +/- 1330). The condition factor was significantly higher for males in April 1996 (1.0366 +/- 0.2849) and lowest in January 1997 (0.9620 +/- 0.1336). The use of condition factor to indicate change in relative weight that is a normal consequence of growth in the species seems not to be justified. Considering allometric length-weight relationship, growth in P. argenteus may not be adequately described by the von Bertalanffy Growth Formula (VBCF). In terms of reproduction, however, interpretation of the data in the light of existing information suggests that P. argenteus in spawning conditions is characterized by a high condition factor, while those in out-of-spawning season are characterized by a low condition factor.

Even though the climate, geomorphology and vegetation seem similar, these aquifers differ. In the Iullemmeden basin, a seasonal fluctuation of the water table during the rainy season is combined with a significant long-term rise due to a change in land use; isotopes (O-18, H-2, H-3, C-14) show a median renewal rate of between 0.1% and 0.2%. In the Lake Chad basin, seasonal fluctuation is much rarer and the long-term trend is of stability or even a small decline of the water table due to the drying up of the Lake Chad; isotopes indicate a median renewal rate of between 0.1% and 0.06%. In both cases, the large difference between the extreme values underlines the great variation in time and space of the recharge.

We tested several methodological questions across the vertical profile: TdR concentration at which maximal incorporation is reached, linearity of incorporation and isotope dilution, during holomixis and stratification periods. The TdR concentration at which maximal incorporation is reached changed seasonally and vertically. During holomixis, maximal incorporation was not always reached at concentrations up to 40 nM. Uptake was always linear in short incubation times and decreased from epi- to hypolimnion. The isotope dilution technique indicated a degree of participation in DNA synthesis higher than 50%, although a linear relationship between the inverse of H-3-TdR incorporation and increasing 'cold' thymidine concentration was not always observed. Autoradiographic experiments showed a low percentage of bacteria taking up H-3-TdR in both aerobic and anaerobic samples. The percentage of total labeled bacteria seemed to be generally higher in the metalimnion (11% maximal value) than in the hypolimnion. Labeled Amoebobacter and Chromatium cells were detected in field samples. Amoebobacter cells photoassimilated TdR in culture. Therefore, our results show that H-3-TdR incorporation is not an appropriate technique to estimate bacterial secondary production in anaerobic systems and in oxic-anoxic interfaces.

J	Jerling, HL; Cyrus, DP				Jerling, HL; Cyrus, DP			The zooplankton communities of an artificially divided subtropical coastal estuarine-lake system in South Africa	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Nhlabane coastal lake and estuary system in South Africa is divided by a permanent barrage constructed at the outlet of the lake. This study compared the zooplankton assemblages of the lake and estuary systems after 15 years of separation. Before sampling commenced the mouth of the estuary closed and remained so throughout the duration of the study. The lake was completely fresh and the estuary had a low salinity not exceeding 4 parts per thousand. Both the estuary and lake are shallow systems (less than 2 m) and were well mixed. Turbidity levels were generally below 10 NTUs. Temperature fluctuated seasonally between 18.5 and 30 degrees C. Oxygen levels ranged between 4.3 and 9.9 mg/l but were mostly above 5 mg/l for both systems. The estuarine and lake plankton was dominated by copepod instars, especially of the calanoid Pseudodiaptomus hessei. During the entire study period the lake also supported high densities of rotifers. Rotifers only appeared in the estuarine plankton at the end of the sampling period. During the first sampling sessions zooplankton diversity in the estuary was higher but declined thereafter to levels within the range calculated for the lake. Estuarine relict species recorded reflect the estuarine history of the lake. Multivariate analyses indicated a change in the composition of the zooplankton community in the estuary during the duration of the study, while that of the lake remained comparatively stable. Species composition analyses showed that this change in the estuary was due to a shift from an estuarine to a more freshwater zooplankton assemblage. During this change some estuarine species declined in abundance or were not recorded anymore. These changes in the zooplankton community of the estuary may well illustrate the changes that occurred in the lower (south) section of the lake after completion of the barrage which isolated it from the estuary.																			0018-8158						1998	390	1-3					25	35		10.1023/A:1003533131410	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003533131410													WOS:000080235900004
J	BORTOLOTTI, GR				BORTOLOTTI, GR			FACTORS INFLUENCING THE GROWTH OF BALD EAGLES IN NORTH CENTRAL SASKATCHEWAN	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Mass and eighth primary growth of nestling Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) were studied in north central Saskatchewan from 1980 to 1982. There were no significant differences among years for any measure of growth. Clutch size and the relative timing of hatching within each breeding season also had no effect on growth. In broods of two young, second-hatched chicks (C2) grew slower than first-hatched chicks (C1) if the hatching interval between siblings was 2 days rather than 1 day. As both hatching asynchrony and the degree of suppressed growth of C2 were independent of absolute growth rates (and hence presumably food supply), it was unlikely that individual females modified the degree of asynchrony in any adaptive manner. Nestlings raised in an area predicted to have high fish (prey) productivity, given the morphology and chemistry of the lake, grew faster than chicks in an area of lower productivity. Growth rate was significantly correlated with the total mass of prey, but not the number of prey items, delivered to the nests by the parents.																			0008-4301	1480-3283				MAR	1989	67	3					606	611		10.1139/z89-088	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z89-088													WOS:A1989U167700012

During high water, the major factors influencing primary production appeared to be nutrient concentrations in the mouthbays and varzea (floodplain) lakes and high levels of suspended matter in the Amazon mainstem. In riverine systems, plankton primary production (PPP) averaged 4.04 mg C .cntdot. m-3 .cntdot. h-1, and measures of respiration (Re) averaged 0.67 mg C .cntdot. m-3 .cntdot. h-1. In the more productive varzea lakes and mouthbays, PPP averaged 26.37 mg C .cntdot. m-3 .cntdot. h-1 and Re averaged 2.30 mg C .cntdot. m-3 .cntdot. h-1. Bacterial densities, 14C-acetate rate constants for uptake, and plankton carbon:ATP ratios implied that heterotrophic microbiota were important components of the plankton communities in riverine waters. The importance of terrestrial organics to metabolic activity in all waters was implied by high particulate carbon:nitrogen ratios (20:1). These features were especially evident in riverine surface waters where integrated respiration rates exceeded those of plankton primary production. Riverine respiratory levels may be attributed to several factors: adequate supplies of terrestrial organic carbon, sufficient dissolved nutrient concentrations, increased surface area of suspended matter for microbial attachment and growth, and shading of phytoplankton by suspended matter which reduces photosynthetic activity. Observed supersaturation of Amazon waters by CO2 was similar to observations for other rivers of the world. Shifts of CO2 solute components to CO2 in surface waters of varzea lakes and mouthbays and of some tributaries implied high partial pressures of carbon dioxide (.apprxeq. 500-1500 Pascals). The primary source of CO2 is most likely decomposing organic matter in planktonic and benthic environments of the rivers, lakes, and flooded terrestrial lowlands. The hypothesis that respiratory input of CO2 balanced by evasion (gas lost to atmosphere) is sufficient to explain high CO2 vapor pressures in the Amazon River appeared true but needs further examination. Particular attention should be given to periods of rising water, when planktonic respiration appears to be 2 orders of magnitude greater than at periods of high water. Subsequent seasonal studies of the Amazon and other large rivers are needed to determine how the plankton community, the chemistry of terrestrially derived organics and their biological oxidation in water, and inorganic factors control CO2 supersaturation and exchange with the atmosphere.

J	ROOS, JC; PIETERSE, AJH				ROOS, JC; PIETERSE, AJH			NUTRIENTS, DISSOLVED-GASES AND PH IN THE VAAL RIVER AT BALKFONTEIN, SOUTH-AFRICA	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Seasonal Variation and interrelationships between environmental variables and nutrients as well as dissolved gases and pH in the Vaal River at Balkfontein were investigated between 1985 and 1989. Photosynthesis and temperature are major factors that influence the concentration and dynamics of O-2 and CO2 in the river water. The average daytime oxygen concentration in the river (9.3 mg l(-1)) rendered the water supersaturated (115 %) which suggests that photosynthesis exceeded respiration and that the river at Balkfontein was autotrophic. Minimum oxygen concentrations and low pH values were recorded during flood periods, coinciding with high turbidity, high temperature and low algal biomass. Vaal River water, with relatively high pH levels (average = 8.1), is a well-buffered system (average alkalinity = 89 mg CaCO3 l(-1)) with only the HCO3- species in the CO2-HCO3-CO3 system of quantitative importance. Total suspended solids (TSS) is an important transport agent for phosphorus and nitrogen. The phosphate phosphorus (PO4-P) concentration was low (average = 16 mu g l-1), but total phosphorus (TP) concentration was high (average = 202 mu g l(-1)). Therefore, to sustain high algal growth, the organisms must have depended on recycling mechanisms to make dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) available from TP. The TN:TP ratio in the Vaal River was relatively low (average = 11), but the DIN:DIP ratio was relatively high (average = 57), suggesting the occurrence of phosphate limitation in the Vaal River. Factors governing fluctuations in NO3-N and NH4-N concentrations (and therefore DIN-DIP ratios) in the Vaal River were discharge, decomposition of organic matter and algal blooms. The SiO2-Si concentration follows the average monthly water temperature, and probably plays an important role in diatom blooms.																			0003-9136					APR	1995	133	2					173	196																WOS:A1995QZ45000005
J	COLONNELLO, G				COLONNELLO, G			PHYSIOGRAPHIC AND ECOLOGICAL ELEMENTS OF THE ORINOCO RIVER BASIN AND ITS FLOODPLAINS	INTERCIENCIA					INTERNATIONAL SYMP ON MAJOR LATIN AMERICAN RIVERS ( SISGRIL )	MAY 28-JUN 03, 1990	CIUDAD GUAYANA, VENEZUELA					In this paper a description is made of the Orinoco River basin and its floodplains considering the various topographic, lithological and climatic aspects which determine the geochemistry of the waters of the basin. The Andean basin is characterized by a strong relief with water courses with a high erosive capacity. They transport coarse sediments which generate clear transparent waters with a high level of nutrients and moderate acidity. The Llanos basin presents water courses draining flat lands. These rivers, which are generally a continuation of Andean rivers, present a high concentration of fine sediments and nutrients, neutral pH, and turbid waters. The Guayana basin drains highly eroded and densely vegetated high lands. Waters present low concentration of nutrients and vary from transparent to dark. The dark colors are due to the high concentration of dissolved organic matter. In the basin the biota is influenced by the heterogeneus characteristics of the waters and consequently shows clear differences in number, species diversity and biogeochemical composition of plants. The last consequence on the plain relieves of the middle and lower sections of the Orinoco River due to the action of the high sediment load transported to the river by its tributaries expresses itself as a floodplain shaped in diverse topoghaphic forms mainly levees and decantation ponds. The floodplain support various types of plant formations and animal populations well adapted to the seasonability of the floods. The numerous floodplain lakes lose their identity during the inundations, forming together with the alluvial plain, extensive flooded areas where the reproductive and feeding processes of many fish species take place. These fishery represent an important food supply for the local population. At low water the flood plain is used in agricultural and extensive husbandry activities. Due to the magnitude of the Orinoco River floodplain it has not yet suffered an important negative impact from development activities. However, development plans considered for the basin may represent a serious threat to the integrity of the ecosystem and attention should be focussed on the need to increase studies in most biotic and physical aspects involved in the system.																			0378-1844					NOV-DEC	1990	15	6					476	485																WOS:A1990EX20400018

Morphological and chemical properties of soils on the eastern shore of Lake Bulukhta, northern Caspian region	EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE												Morphological and chemical properties of soils in a soil catena crossing the eastern coast of salt Bulukhta Lake in the northern part of the Caspian region were studied. The catena included different kinds of solonetzes and solonchaks occupying the lake bottom. The morphogenetic and analytical study of the soils made it possible to judge the intensity of the major soil-forming processes on different elements of the local topography. It was shown that the intensity of humus accumulation increases from the autonomous eluvial positions towards the accumulative positions and decreases in the superaqual landscape, where the accumulation of organic matter is limited by the high soil salinity and by the washout of humified material from the shore into the lake. In the transitional and accumulative positions of the catena with saline parent materials, the upper soil horizons are subjected to desalinization owing to the additional water inflow and transformation of surface runoff into subsurface water flows along zoogenic pores. A comparative analysis of the seasonal dynamics of the level, salinity, and chemical composition of groundwater under the soils of the catena was performed. It demonstrated that the dynamics of the groundwater level and salinity in the geochemically subordinate positions depend on the hydrological regime of the lake, which, in turn, is controlled by the amount and seasonal distribution of precipitation.					; KOLESNIKOV, Andrei/ABG-2447-2021	Kolesnikov, Alexander/0000-0003-0814-1812; Shabanova, Natalya/0000-0002-8914-1891; 													1064-2293	1556-195X				AUG	2015	48	8					781	791		10.1134/S1064229315080074	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1064229315080074													WOS:000358782700001

The total count of heterotrophic bacteria in the water from the wetland did not overcome 2.3 x 10(5) CFU cm(-3); on plants the respective counts were 3.4 x 10(9) CFU GDW(-1) on submerged parts and 1.6 x 10(9) CFU GDW(-1) on aerial leaves. In the soil and on the surface of older roots the counts of heterotrophic bacteria were, respectively, 3.7 x 10(9) and 1 x 10(9) CFU GDW(-1), whereas on new root the number of bacteria was 2.5 x 10(10) CFU GDW(-1). Among the physiological groups of heterotrophic bacteria analyzed, amylolytic bacteria were the most numerous. Their maximum counts on the surface of submerged fragments of plants, in soil and on old (from the previous year) roots reached between less than ten million, less than a hundred million and more units. Lipolytic and proteolytic bacteria were present in smaller numbers; they only sporadically reached between less than ten million or less than a hundred million CFU GDW(-1). The differences in the counts of the physiological groups of heterotrophic bacteria in water and on different plant fragments between the two studied sites were small and never exceeded one order of value.

Surface sediments (5 cm) of Lake AitaOrvi, northern Finnish Lapland, were examined for modern and recent proportions of chydorid cladoceran ephippia in subarctic climate near the pine limit. The total chydorid ephippium proportions (TCE) were steadily 9.5-9.7% in the AitaOrvi sediment but declined to 8.4% in the uppermost sample. The result was compared with the surface sediment TCE from four lakes in southern Finland where it varied between 3-6%. It was also compared with the TCE from two lakes in northernmost Finnish Lapland above the treeline in very severe climate, where it was 26-30%. These very high values suggest that there might be a threshold in climate conditions between Aitajarvi and the two northernmost lakes that alters the reproduction of chydorids towards an even more important role of sexual reproduction.																			1641-5558	2300-0384					2007	24						69	72																WOS:000437900600008

Twenty-eight species of zooplankton were identified, although momentary species composition usually comprised 2 calanoids, 1 cyclopoid, 3-6 cladocerans and 0-4 rotifers. There were no consistent patterns in the vertical or horizontal distribution of the major zooplankters. Some species, including Boeckella triarticulata, Calamoecia ampulla, Bosmina meridionalis, Ceriodaphnia quadrangula and possibly Daphnia carinata were perennial, whereas Diaphanosoma unguiculatum, Moina micrura and Daphnia lumholtzi were seasonal. Zooplankton density was relatively high and constant throughout the study. The zooplankton community included both large and small species. In Lake Alexandrina, high turbidity may preclude size-selective fish predation, allowing the persistence of large species, while invertebrate predation may be insufficient to remove small species.																			0067-1940						1984	35	4					417	426																WOS:A1984SW61700003

The distribution of prey body size in each habitat generally conformed to a lognormal distribution, allowing a simple characterization of prey size and abundance in each habitat. Seasonally, the abundance of large littoral invertebrates declined markedly, shifting the distribution of prey size in the vegetation and bare sediment habitats towards smaller prey. The total biomass of vegetation-dwelling prey (exclusive of gastropods) also declined dramatically from May-Aug. These seasonal changes in prey size and abundance were correlated with a reduction in foraging intake for the dominant fish species in the lake, the bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus).

J	Eriksson, MG; Bonnefille, R; Lafon, S				Eriksson, MG; Bonnefille, R; Lafon, S			Recent lake level variations in Lake Haubi, central Tanzania, interpreted from pollen and sediment studies	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Variations in pollen assemblages and in physical and chemical composition of a dated sediment record from the small Lake Haubi in north central Tanzania, reveal lake level fluctuations since the late 19th century. Lake Haubi changed from a seasonally inundated swamp to a lake in the beginning of the 20th century. With the exception of 1942-44, when it dried out completely, it remained water filled until 1994 when it again turned into a swamp. The lake level fluctuations in Lake Haubi are largely in phase with fluctuations of the larger East African lakes levels during the 20th century, and are therefore interpreted as being mainly controlled by regional climatic fluctuations. However, the initial formation of Lake Haubi at the turn of the century was likely due to local catchment specific causes, e.g. changes in land use, as the rapid increase in the water level at this time does not correspond to other lake level records from the region.																			0921-2728	1573-0417				DEC	1999	22	4					457	473		10.1023/A:1008066726211	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1008066726211													WOS:000084698800009
J	RYAN, PA				RYAN, PA			SEASONAL AND SIZE-RELATED CHANGES IN THE FOOD OF THE SHORT-FINNED EEL, ANGUILLA-AUSTRALIS IN LAKE ELLESMERE, CANTERBURY, NEW-ZEALAND	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												An approximately monthly sampling programme in Lake Ellesmere, Canterbury, New Zealand, from January 1974 to April 1976 yielded 487 eels. The stomachs were fixed in 10% neutralised formalin and the contents examined. Preliminary analysis indicated that the mollusc Potamopyrgus antipodarum, the isopod Austridotea annectens, the mysid Tenagomysis chiltoni, the amphipod Paracalliope fluviatilis, the midge larva Chironomus zealandicus and the teleosts Retropinna retropinna, Galaxias maculatus and Gobiomorphus cotidianus together made up the bulk of the diet. The pre-ingested dry weight (i.e. the reconstructed weight) of the most important of these prey species was obtained by relating the length of a digestion resistant part to actual dry weight in field collected specimens. Regression equations for this relationship in each season enabled the reconstructed dry weight of each stomach item to be calculated. In some instances recontructed weight was less than the actual digested dry weight of the prey specimen. In every case the larger value was used. This method is referred to as Combination Dry Weight (CDW) and is believed to be new. These data, used in conjunction with the energy content of the species concerned, enabled the caloric dietary contribution of each prey species to be determined. Comparison of relative contribution to eel diet between CDW and energy values calculated from CDW and bomb caloimetry revealed large differences. Marked variations in diet between .ltoreq. 40 cm, 40.1-50 cm, and >F 50.1 cm size classes were also shown. Eels .ltoreq. 40 cm feed primarily on invertebrates and become progressively more piscivorous as they grow. Eels > 50.1 cm are almost entirely piscivorous. Seasonal differences in diet also exist within each size class examined.																			0378-1909	1573-5133				JAN 15	1986	15	1					47	58		10.1007/BF00005388	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00005388													WOS:A1986A230100003
J	López-Hernández, D				Lopez-Hernandez, Danilo			Phosphorous cycling and biogeochemistry in a Venezuelan-flooded savanna	CHEMISTRY AND ECOLOGY												In 1970, a programme of land recuperation started in Venezuelan savannas, strongly affected by the seasonality of precipitation; therefore, a network of dykes has been built to alleviate the floods and retain water throughout the dry period. Under the dyked system, the environment has been altered, allowing a change in the herbaceous vegetation towards aquatic species and an increase in primary production. It is assumed that a considerable quantity of nutrients is lost from the ecosystem through the floodgates, a situation that could be worsened with the climate change. This contribution describes the atmospheric input and total output in stream run-off of phosphorous (P) in a flooded savanna. Internal pools of the biogeochemical cycle of P associated with terrestrial compartments are described. In the flooded savanna, a large amount of P is immobilised (29.6 kg ha(-1)) in their above ground biomass by grasses, and in soil microbial biomass. The P budget was nearly balanced, as measured losses were cancelled out by the inputs in rainfall. Soils act as a sink, retaining P coming either from precipitation or from desorption/mineralisation processes. That interruption can be maximised, and losses of P and other nutrients can be minimised with an adequate management of the floodgate.																			0275-7540	1029-0370				JUL 4	2015	31	5					389	401		10.1080/02757540.2015.1050001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02757540.2015.1050001													WOS:000359746800001
J	Pongswat, S; Suphan, S				Pongswat, Sirikhae; Suphan, Sutthawan			Toxic Algae as a Component of Phytoplankton in Irrigation Canals (Thailand)	CHIANG MAI JOURNAL OF SCIENCE												An investigation of the distribution of toxic algae in Khlong Rangsit, Prathumthani Province was conducted from December 2007 to May 2009. Seven divisions and 88 species of phytoplankton were found. Seven species of toxic algae, namely Anabaena circinalis, Cylindrospermopsts phillippinensis, C. raciberskii, Microcystis aeruginosa, Oseillatoria limasa and Oscillatoria tenuis, were found. Futhermore, toxic algae, namely Microcystis aeruginosa, was found to be widely distributed at many of the sampling sites and usually formed as scum on the water's surface, of which the highest cell density was recorded as 4864111 cellL(-1). The highest biovolume of phytoplankton were Oseillatoria limasa and Oscillatoria tenuis, respectively. For microcystin analysis, the microcystin RR type was detected in high abundance, but microcystin YR type was not found to be present in any of the samples. The highest values of microcystin RR and microcystin LR type were 0.85 mgmL(-1) and 0.53 mgmL(-1), respectively. Based on the standard for surface water quality of Thailand, the water of Khlong Rangsit was classified in the fourth category and could be used for household consumption after going through disinfection and special water treatment processes.																			0125-2526					JUL	2015	42	3					560	577																WOS:000360136500003

The study was conducted in a shallow lake in northeastern Argentina (27 degrees 29' S; 58 degrees 45' W), between March 2007 and February 2010. Sixty-one taxa were exclusive to P illinoensis, 12 were exclusive to N. indica, and 54 were common to both. Density, number of species and diversity were comparatively higher in P illinoensis than in N. indica. Cyanobacteria (mainly Stigonema hormoides Bornet & Flahault) were dominant in P illinoensis, whereas Chlorophyta (Oedogonium spp.) were dominant in N. indica. Potamogeton illinoensis developed a stable, mature epiphytic community over time. In N. indica, the density and diversity of periphytic algae were related to the plant seasonality and water level fluctuations.																				2446-8231				JUN 30	2015	70	1					129	142																WOS:000360780300011

Distribution and caracterization of environments used by otters in the coastal region of Santa Catarina state, Brazil	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Studies related to the distribution and characterization of environments used by otters in the coastal region of Santa Catarina State has been conducted since 1999. Three different habitats are monitored: a river, a coastal island and a freshwater lake. Characterization of otter's shelters in the three environments related to the organization and use of the internal space is realized. One of the shelters has its temperature monitored in order to describe the relation of the frequency of use by the animal. The analysis of the diet of the specie together with visual observation is used to infer about the social organization. A close relation between the shelters with the geology and vegetation is found. The main preys of the otters indicate that it is basically a lonely animal. Depending on the season it can shows a group of two to four individuals. The preliminary results can be used as an indication to future measures related to the preservation and conservation of otters in the state.

More attention has been focused on the case of acute infectious diseases and sudden death in the buffaloes. Fasciolosis black disease, acute enteritis, especially fatal enterotoxaemia, haemorrhagic septicaemia. and trypanosomiasis (Surra), are some of the important diseases found in these animals. Black disease caused by toxigenic Clostridium novyi occurs in the presence of the organism in the liver and the degree of liver fluke Fasciola gigantica infestation. In regions where black disease is enzootic, Cl. novyi can be isolated from livers of normal healthy animals. In Hulu Sungai Utara district, South Kalimantan, the prevalence of fasciolosis caused by Fasciola gigantica in swamp buffalo was 77% in 1991. A gross sudden change in diet due to seasonal changes could induce rumen and intestinal stasis, which provide a favourable environment for the rapid proliferation of commensal toxigenic Clostridium perfringens in the small intestine. Subsequent absorption of the toxin produced through the gut wall and its generalized dissemination culminated in a fatal enterotoxaemia. Haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS) is an acute, fatal disease affecting swamp buffalo, and caused by Pasteurella multocida B : 2. The swamp buffalo is particularly susceptible for HS, and the reported greatest losses of swamp buffalo in Kalimantan due to HS is recorded in 1980s. The clinical signs of Surra in swamp buffalo were also found in certain areas in Danau Panggang area. Hulu Sungai Utara district. Vaccination is the accepted method for controlling Black disease, enterotoxaemia and HS. Multi component vaccine, alum adjuvant containing at least 5 types of clostridia! toxoids and P. multocida B2 bacterin have been used and provide good protection to the animals. Control and treatment of liver fluke infestation is advisable. Vaccination is recommended annually and should be carried out regularly. In these days, the farmers concern about the availability of the grass in the Danau Panggang area. The primary feed grass (Oryza sativa forma spontanea L), of the swamp buffalo were not sufficient in the low-tide season. The over population of Pamocea canaliculata (golden snail), a pest for lake vegetations, was thought to be responsible for this phenomena. Growing forages as the source of animal feed may be an option to improve the current performance of the swamp buffalo in the area.																			0216-6461	2354-6832				DEC	2006	16	4					206	215																WOS:000437144600005
J	MARTINO, RL				MARTINO, RL			LIMNOPUS TRACKWAYS FROM THE CONEMAUGH GROUP (LATE PENNSYLVANIAN), SOUTHERN WEST-VIRGINIA	JOURNAL OF PALEONTOLOGY												Abundant and well-preserved tetrapod footprints have been discovered in the Glenshaw Formation (Lower Conemaugh Group) in Wayne County, West Virginia. The tracks occur along at least three horizons within a 30-cm-thick stratigraphic interval about 15 m (50 ft) above the Brush Creek Limestone; they are of Missourian age. The tracks are preserved mainly as casts on the underside of thin-bedded, ripple cross-laminated sandstones and less commonly as molds in intervening dark-gray shales. Associated body fossils include Spirorbis worm tubes and washed-in plant debris. Facies characteristics indicate the tracks were formed along the margins of an ephemeral lake in a flood basin setting adjacent to delta plain fluviodeltaic channel systems. Short-lived lacustrine conditions were likely to have resulted from a seasonal tropical to subtropical climate. Most of the tracks can be assigned to the ichnogenus Limnopus, making them one of the earliest known occurrences. At least five trackways are discernible with an external width ranging from 320 to 400 mm. Limnopus glenshawensis, a new ichnospecies, is herein proposed and various morphologic and locomotion parameters are quantified. Mean values include stride/manus, 407 mm; stride/pes, 411 mm; oblique pace/manus, 313 mm; oblique pace/pes, 317 mm; pace angle/manus, 82.4 degrees; pace angle/pes, 80.5 degrees; glenoacetabular distance, 329 mm; manus length, 87.2 mm; manus width, 104.2 mm; pes length, 121.4 mm; pes width, 112.7 mm.

J	MARSHALL, BE				MARSHALL, BE			SEASONAL AND ANNUAL VARIATIONS IN THE ABUNDANCE OF PELAGIC SARDINES IN LAKE KARIBA, WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE EFFECTS OF DROUGHT	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The introduced sardine, Limnothrissa miodon, is now the most important fish species in Lake Kariba, a very large African man-made lake. It has a distinct seasonal cycle of abundance, related to that of the zooplankton on which it feeds. This is dependent on the seasonal physico-chemical cycle of the lake. Sardine abundance is also influenced by the flow of the tributary rivers that drain into the lake and carry nutrients from their catchment areas. Low flow in these rivers leads to reduced sardine populations which was shown clearly by reduced catches following a series of droughts. Evidence suggests that poor river flows lead to low nutrient levels in the hypolimnion resulting in low plankton populations and poor sardine catches at the time of turnover when the highest catches are usually made. This suggests that climate factors are important conditions in the management of pelagic fisheries in man-made lakes.																			0003-9136					MAY	1988	112	3					399	409																WOS:A1988N775100006

The influence of temperature, kind of water and characteristics of the different sampling sites on the numbers of vibrios recovered was evaluated. Maximum recovery of vibrios reached 103/ml in both types of waters analyzed. V. cholerae numbers reached 103/ml in the lake and 102 in one of the coastal sites. Frequently during the warm season, all vibrios isolated were identified as V. cholerae. Occasionally, no V. cholerae was recovered. The recovery of vibrios was significantly influenced by the temperature of the water and the type of water analyzed. Most of the V. cholerae isolates were included in Heiberg groups I and II, and nearly 50% of the strains used chitin as sole C source. Indole was not produced by 100% of the strains.

The documented exploitation of sand Hills lake and prairie habitats also defines a previously unexplored element of Central Plains tradition subsistence economies. The latter portion of the Central Plains tradition coincided with the cool and arid Pacific climatic episode (AD 1200-1550).

A case against acidifying freshwater macrophytes prior to C and N stable isotope analysis	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												Acidifying organic samples prior to stable isotope analysis is a common practice to eliminate inorganic carbonates; however, it is still unclear what impact this has on delta C-13 and delta N-15 values. Here we present the first extensive study to test the effects of acidification on freshwater macrophyte carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios. Focusing on the more productive and ecologically relevant seasons, we collected eleven common macrophyte species (both submerged and emergent), from four lakes in south-central Ontario, Canada. These lakes vary considerably in chemistry, particularly in the inorganic carbon and calcium concentrations. All individual plant samples were equally separated, prepared into acidified and un-acidified treatments, and analyzed for their carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios. No significant differences in macrophyte delta C-13 or delta N-15 were detected between the treatments. Additionally, we found that within-species delta C-13 variability was greater in acidified samples. Finally, in assessing the isotopic values of different macrophytes across a chemical gradient at different times throughout the season, it became evident that natural variability exists in both the delta C-13 and delta N-15 of un-acidified samples within and between species. Based on these results, we assert that pre-analysis acidification of freshwater macrophytes from temperate lakes is unnecessary and not recommended. Additionally, we implore ecologists to acknowledge the macrophyte delta C-13 and delta N-15 variability in future food web studies.																			1386-2588	1573-5125				JUN	2015	49	2					251	261		10.1007/s10452-015-9519-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-015-9519-2													WOS:000354612800009

Phosphorus recovery from highly concentrated phosphate-ion groundwater by calcium-carrying chaff charcoal	WATER PRACTICE AND TECHNOLOGY												The chaff produced during the crop season that was attached with calcium was used in an upward type column for the purpose of recovering highly accumulated phosphorus in groundwater. The amount of phosphorus recovery obtained in various hydraulic retention time was 1.5-2.0 mg per 1 g of chaff. Owing to the reaction of calcium on the surface of chaff charcoal with phosphate ion in groundwater, calcium phosphate compound was produced and might be existed as hardly soluble calcium phosphate as it did not elute in citric acid. Thus, phosphorus recovered could not be directly used as fertilizer. It needed support from mycorrhizal fungi in soils, rainwater, etc. to be usable for the farmland. It was also confirmed that pH value was an effective indicator in phosphorus recovery performance because the results show that concentration of phosphate ion in treated water was depend on pH value. Phosphorous recovery using calcium-carrying chaff charcoal is expected to mitigate the severe eutrophication problems at Hachiro Lake.

PARTICULATE COMPONENTS	AQUATIC BOTANY												The decomposition of particulate organic matter (POM) from 5 spp. of freshwater vascular macrophytes was analyzed over a 180 day period under controlled conditions of temperature and O2 (10 and 25.degree. C; aerobic and anaerobic). A series of seasonal decomposition experiments were conducted in situ under different lake conditions. Plant species studied included the emergent Scirpus acutus Bigelow, the floating-leaved lily Nuphar variegatum Engelm., and the submersed Myriophyllum heterophyllum Michx., Najas flexilis (Willd.) Rostk. and Schmidt, and the submersed bulrush S. subterminalis Torrey. At 2, 4, 10, 24, 48, 90 and 180 day intervals, organic weight, ash, C, N, total non-structural carbohydrates (TNC), and fiber components (lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose) were determined under each of the experimental conditions. A model was developed that fit the observed weight-loss data. Resistance of particulate tissue to microbial decomposition was strongly influenced by the composition of the plant species. The floating-leaved plant decomposed faster than the submersed plants, which decomposed more rapidly than the emergent species. Decay rates were related to initial N and fiber contents, with high N, low-fiber plants decomposing most rapidly. Unlike the leached dissolved organic matter (DOM) of the plants whose rate of decomposition was mostly influenced by O2 availability, the rate of conversion of particulate matter to CO2 and/or DOM was regulated primarily by temperature, tissue N and fiber content. All species showed similar trends in decomposition under both laboratory and in situ conditions, but the species-specific rates differed under the various laboratory conditions of temperature and O2.																			0304-3770	1879-1522					1978	5	4					301	327		10.1016/0304-3770(78)90074-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(78)90074-8													WOS:A1978GM52100002

Within profiles along the transect, the highest salt concentrations are found in the lower part of profiles. Sodium, K, Mg, Cl, and SO4 concentrations increase along the transect toward Soda Lake. Calcium concentration, in the form of gypsum, is generally higher in profiles in the middle of the transect. Concentrations of Na, Ca, Mg, Cl, and SO4 increase with depth in profiles away from Soda Lake as a function of a greater degree of leaching; higher concentrations of these ions are found toward the surface in profiles closer to Soda Lake due to capillary movement from the groundwater. Halite is the only mineral in the surface horizons. Gypsum is more common in lower horizons, closer to ground water, and is the common salt in soils farther away from Soda Lake. Other soluble evaporites, including halite, loeweite [Na12Mg7(SO4)13 .cntdot. 15H2O], and bloedite [Na2Mg(SO4)2 .cntdot. 4H2O], together with gypsum, are found in extracts of soils near Soda Lake. A seasonal influence on the anion and cation distribution generally is noticeable only in soils with intermediate salt concentrations. Higher concentrations of anions and cations are found following the dry season. The orderly differences in anion and cation concentrations within most of the profiles and along the transect reflect the well established differences in solubility of the different salts.																			0361-5995	1435-0661				MAY-JUN	1989	53	3					898	903		10.2136/sssaj1989.03615995005300030044x	http://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1989.03615995005300030044x													WOS:A1989AC08300044

Sucrose content and the ionic concentrations of the cations Na+, K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+ and the anions Cl- and SO42- of the vacuolar sap were estimated. Sucrose concentration in the vacuolar sap of vegetative growing plants was negligible, but with the beginning of the sexual reproduction period (fructification) the sucrose content increased from about 2 mol m-3 to 110 mol m-3. This level remained constant until the end of the fructification period. In spite of the increase of the sucrose concentration the osmotic potential of the vacuolar sap was constant. This was achieved by changing the ionic concentrations accordingly; in old or vegetative growing plants the ionic content accounted for about 80% of the vacuolar osmotic potential, but was about 63% during fructification. Sucrose is considered as a major photosynthate to supply the developing antheridia and oogonia and to serve as a precursor for the starch stored in the eggs.																			0140-7791	1365-3040				JAN	1988	11	1					55	61		10.1111/j.1365-3040.1988.tb01778.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3040.1988.tb01778.x													WOS:A1988M162300010

Daily 1200 UTC surface pressure, 500 mb height and 850 mb temperature data are used in a compositing analysis to indicate the general conditions on tornado-producing days during four quasi-seasonal periods. Temporally, two-thirds of all northeast tornadoes occur between the hours of 1800 UTC and 0000 UTC. Annually, greater than 75% occur during the four-month period from May through August. During the period of study (1950 through 1986) the region had an average of 30 tornado occurrences per year. Spatially, three preferred areas of tornadic development are identified across the northeast region. These areas include western and southeastern Pennsylvania and north-central Massachusetts. The general synoptic patterns associated with tornadic events in the northeast United States remain consistent throughout the year. The composite analyses indicate that the presence of a strong surface low pressure system moving through the Great Lakes, coupled with significant upper-level divergence associated with a vigorous shortwave feature and a cold frontal boundary, are the synoptic features most common during the initiation of tornadic storms in this region.					; Leathers, Daniel/A-3665-2010	Leathers, Daniel/0000-0001-9002-9031; 													0272-3646					MAR-APR	1993	14	2					171	190		10.1080/02723646.1993.10642475	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02723646.1993.10642475													WOS:A1993LR54200006
J	YANG, XB; SNOW, JP; BERGGREN, GT				YANG, XB; SNOW, JP; BERGGREN, GT			PATTERNS OF RHIZOCTONIA FOLIAR BLIGHT ON SOYBEAN AND EFFECT OF AGGREGATION ON DISEASE DEVELOPMENT	PHYTOPATHOLOGY												Each of six soybean fields with a history of Rhizoctonia foliar blight was divided into 0.75- x 0.75-m quadrats. Diseased leaves in each quadrat were initially counted at soybean growth stage V8-V11. At soybean growth stage R4, disease incidence in each quadrat was assessed. Lloyd's index of patchiness (LIP) of diseased leaves ranged from 1.56 to 4.54 at the first rating. At the second disease rating, LIP of disease incidence for each plot ranged from 1.32 to 2.15, indicating a decrease in disease aggregation (except for 1987 Lake Arthur). Cluster size was examined using paired-quadrat variance analysis. Different cluster size were detected in different fields, indicating an environmental effect on pathogen dispersal. For each field, paired-quadrat variance curves from two rating dates had similar trends. The apparent infection rates of the disease were negatively correlated with the LIP at first rating (P < 0.05), indicating that spatial pattern influenced disease development. Disease incidence late in the season was predicted with a logistic model, using early infection as a predictor (P < 0.01). Incorporation of LIP into the logistic growth model to correct aggregation effect improved the prediction.																			0031-949X					MAR	1991	81	3					287	293		10.1094/Phyto-81-287	http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/Phyto-81-287													WOS:A1991FA21300011
J	Chaleeraktrakoon, C				Chaleeraktrakoon, Chavalit			STOCHASTIC PROCEDURE FOR GENERATING SEASONAL FLOWS	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING												The generation of seasonal flows that can reproduce the historic basic statistics at more than one aggregation level is usually desirable for most reservoir simulation studies. The objective of this paper is to propose a stochastic procedure for generating seasonal flows at one or several sites. The proposed procedure combines a singular value decomposition (SVD) with a multivariate autoregressive of order one AR(1) model [SVD/MAR(1)]. The SVD transforms a standardized matrix of normalized flows into its standardized principal components, and the MAR(1) model is applied to the standardized principal components matrix. The SVD/MAR(1) procedure was compared with the existing SVD and MAR(1) approaches using the Great Lakes and Quebec rivers data. It can be concluded that the proposed SVD/MAR(1) procedure is applicable where the available flow data are limited and/or the number of considered sites is large. Furthermore, it can preserve adequately the basic statistics and some drought related properties of historic monthly and annual flows.																			1084-0699					OCT	1999	4	4					337	343		10.1061/(ASCE)1084-0699(1999)4:4(337)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)1084-0699(1999)4:4(337)													WOS:000207775500005
J	Sanyanga, RA				Sanyanga, RA			Variations in abundance of Synodontis zambezensis (Pisces: Mochokidae) Peters 1852, in the inshore fishery of Lake Kariba	FISHERIES RESEARCH												In Lake Kariba Synodontis zambezensis Peters 1852 dominated catches in a survey done in 1990-1993 using Lundgren multimesh monofilament gill-nets, S. zambezensis had a catch of 43.8% fresh weight followed by Serranochromis codringtonii (13.8%), Hydrocynus vittarus (9.6%) then Schibe intermedius (6.5%). The other species did not contribute more than 5% individually. At nine of the 13 stations sampled S, zambezensis made up more than 40% of the total catches by fresh weight. Its index of relative importance (IRI) was 54%, followed by Brycinus lateralis 20% and Barbus unitaeniatus 8%. Other inshore species contributed less than 18% all combined. The catches of S. zamhezensis increased with depth as those of the other inshore species decreased. The highest catch per unit effort (CPUE) occurred at 12-20 m and lowest at 3-6 months for the months May to November. The depth variation was similar at all stations analysed (P=0.066). However, the sampling month was the factor that most determined the depth zone with the highest CPUE. The CPUE was found to vary seasonally showing a peak in April, the lowest catches occurred from August to October. The appearance of high catches in the shallower depths coincided with the breeding period. The patterns of distribution were different for size and CPUE. The large fish occurred in the shallower zones. The size also varied with position of station in relation to the dam wall. The smallest fish occurred near the riverine end of the lake. It appears that S. zambezensis has increased considerably in abundance since the establishment of Lake Kariba and may still be increasing. Its success is attributed to the fact that it is not captured by fishermen's gill-nets, its ecological niche is robust and it is not extensively predated.																			0165-7836					APR	1996	26	1-2					171	186		10.1016/0165-7836(95)00386-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0165-7836(95)00386-X													WOS:A1996UF56000013

Diel (24-hour-period) as well as seasonal changes in fish distribution and aggregation behaviour have been established. Concerning the assessment of the fish stocks, these changes in fish behaviour have to be considered. Some clear fluctuations of fish numbers, which coincide with flood events of the river are interpreted as indications of fish migration from the river into the lentic water.																			0273-1223						1994	29	3					307	309		10.2166/wst.1994.0126	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.1994.0126													WOS:A1994NU83300048
J	BROCH, ES				BROCH, ES			OSMOREGULATORY PATTERNS OF ADAPTATION TO INLAND ASTATIC WATERS BY 2 SPECIES OF FAIRY SHRIMPS, BRANCHINECTA-GIGAS LYNCH AND BRANCHINECTA-MACKINI DEXTER	JOURNAL OF CRUSTACEAN BIOLOGY												The fairy shrimps Branchinecta gigas Lynch and Brachinecta mackini Dexter were found in association in four lakes in central Washington State [USA] and in one lake in British Columbia [Canada]. Sodium and carbonate were the dominant ions in three lakes analyzed. In two of the lakes, they made up in mequivalence 90% of the total principal ions; and in one lake 75%. Sodium alone accounted for 44-47% mequiv. Individual lakes exhibited marked differences in osmolarities during the life-span of both congeneric species. The higher saline lake ranged from 130-461 mOsm/l during the life-span of B. gigas and from 130-645 mOsm/l for B. mackini. The lower salinity lake ranged from 6-30 mOsm/l. Moreover, the lakes underwent marked differences in salinity levels from year to year. In the higher salinity lake during 1966 the salinity ranged from 130-624 mOsm/l, whereas in 1969 it never exceeded 150 mOsm/l, and in 1967 it never went below 340 mOsm/l. Therefore, an important environmental factor in astatic saline lake ecology is the magnitude of the osmotic changes from year to year as well as the seasonal osmotic changes. In waters less than 225 mOsm/l, B. gigas hyperosmoregulates, while at higher osmolarities it osmoconforms. Branchinecta mackini has a similar mode of osmoregulation, although it is a weaker hyperosmoregulator and can tolerate lower internal osmolarities. In addition, the tolerance to salinity of B. mackini appears to be higher than that of B. gigas. Branchinecta mackini was observed in waters as high as 645 mOsm/l in nature, whereas the maximum observed for B. gigas was 485 mOsm/l. Therefore, the osmotic adaptation of B. gigas and B. mackini to saline waters consists of hyperosmoregulation during the low salinity phase and tolerance by conforming during the higher salinity phase. This differs markedly from the pattern in Artemia and Paratemia, but is similar to Branchinecta campestris. Differences in adaptation of species of Branchinectidae to astatic waters appear to be in degree of tolerance to osmolarity and in differential adapation to varying ionic composition.																			0278-0372	1937-240X				AUG	1988	8	3					383	391		10.2307/1548277	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1548277													WOS:A1988P781900008
J	SCHWAN, TG				SCHWAN, TG			SEASONAL ABUNDANCE OF FLEAS (SIPHONAPTERA) ON GRASSLAND RODENTS IN LAKE-NAKURU NATIONAL-PARK, KENYA, AND POTENTIAL FOR PLAGUE TRANSMISSION	BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH												Seasonal abundance of fleas infesting small mammals was studied from July 1975 to August 1976 in a grassland in Lake Nakuru National Park, Kenya. Ten species of rodents and two species of shrews were live-trapped 935 times. The Nile grass rat (Arvicanthis niloticus) was the most abundant species, with 233 individuals captured 690 times, forming 73.8% of all captures. From these grass rats, 4247 fleas were collected, including Dinopsyllus lypusus Jordan and Rothschild (n = 2596), Xenopsylla bantorum Jordan (n = 1396) and Ctenophthalmus calceatus cabirus Jordan and Rothschild (n = 255), D. lypusus and C. calceatus cabirus were more abundant on Nile grass rats during the rains, while X. bantorum became more abundant during the dry season and peaked during the early part of the rains. The potential for plague transmission by fleas between Nile grass rats probably exists all year. The potential for transmission to people living in close proximity to these rodents may be highest during the seasonal peak of X. bantorum, at the end of the dry season.																			0007-4853	1475-2670				DEC	1986	76	4					633	648		10.1017/S0007485300015133	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0007485300015133													WOS:A1986F827300010
J	BERNABO, JC				BERNABO, JC			QUANTITATIVE ESTIMATES OF TEMPERATURE-CHANGES OVER THE LAST 2700 YEARS IN MICHIGAN BASED ON POLLEN DATA	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Temperatures for the past 2700 yr are estimated using well-dated pollen data from northwestern lower Michigan. The pollen data were sampled from sediment cores of 4 lakes along a 75 km transect, with fine-grained morainic soils around the 2 western lakes and sandy outwash soils around the lakes to the east. Climatic reconstructions based on the pollen data from the sandy sites show less temperature change than the reconstructions from the other sites, because variations in the composition of the vegetation at the sandy sites are edaphically restricted. One of the cores studied was dated by counting visible annual laminations (varves). The cores from the other lakes were dated based on 3 radiocarbon dates per core as well as the historically determined age of the settlement horizons. All the time scales were cross-checked using pollen-stratigraphic correlation between the 4 sites. A calibration function was developed using a network of modern pollen and climate data covering all of lower Michigan. Based on this calibration function, the 2700 yr reconstruction for Marion Lake indicates an estimated growing-season temperature range of 1.3.degree. C between extreme 30 yr means. Mild conditions persisted prior to approximately A.D. 400, but a cold interval occurred between approximately A.D. 500 and 800. The well-marked warm period evident from approximately A.D. 1000 to 1200 was the last time when temperatures were about equal to the 1931-1960 mean. A prolonged cooling occurred after A.D. 1200 and reached 1.degree. C below the 1931-1960 mean by the 1700s. A warming of 0.5.degree. C is indicated from approximately A.D. 1750 to 1850. The estimated temperatures for the 1830s at Marion Lake agree with the instrumental data for that period and this provides some validation of the calibration-function results.																			0033-5894	1096-0287					1981	15	2					143	159		10.1016/0033-5894(81)90101-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0033-5894(81)90101-0													WOS:A1981LK67100003

Our goals were to locate important foraging areas of American White Pelicans from the Pathfinder Reservoir nesting colony, document major foraging habitats and to determine whether annual and within-breeding season variation existed with use of feeding habitats. The most frequently used foraging areas of American White Pelicans included portions of the North Platte and Sweetwater rivers and Pathfinder Reservoir. American White Pelicans foraged in a variety of wetland habitats within 75 km of the nesting colony including rivers, reservoirs, and other habitat (marsh, pond, lake, small reservoir, stream) types. Significant year-to-year and within-breeding season variation existed with use of different foraging habitats. Most year-to-year and within-breeding season differences in habitat use occurred in the small river and other habitat (marsh, pond, lake, small reservoir, stream) types. Prey available to American White Pelicans probably determined which habitats were used and accounted for spatial and temporal variation in use of foraging areas. Because American White Pelicans exhibited plasticity in resource use, our results caution against conclusions made from data on habitat use gathered during only one month or one year.																			0738-6028						1995	18	1					47	57		10.2307/1521398	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1521398													WOS:A1995RC99200006

Littorella uniflora dominates at depths of 0-2 m and Isoetes lacustris from 2.0-4.5 m. Within the colonization area the mean midsummer biomass of Littorella is 112 g organic dry wt/m2 and that of Isoetes, 66 g m2. The total biomass of these 2 spp. constitutes 99% of the biomass of submerged macrophytes. The perennial Littorella shows only small seasonal biomass variations. The vegetational biomass, the above-ground fraction of the biomass, and the weight of individual plants all increased with the organic content of the sediment at water depths from 0-0.75 m. At the same time the interstitial concentrations of CO2, extractable inorganic N2 and exchangeable inorganic P increased, supporting the hypothesis that an increasing organic content of the sediments at this low level creates a physiologically richer medium for the plants. The isolated growth form is discussed in relation to the chemical environment of oligotrophic, softwater lakes.

Twelve non-native species of fauna were recorded, that penetrated into the Liman with ships' ballast water (established species - 6, cryptogenic species - 2, casual species - 4). The basic 'groups of risk' of invasions are tintinnids infusorians, neritic species of copepods and spionid polychaetes. The attempt to define the degree of vulnerability of the recipient ecosystem to biological invasions is made on the basis of an energy balance method.

J	BEAUCHAMP, DA				BEAUCHAMP, DA			MOVEMENTS, HABITAT USE, AND SPAWNING STRATEGIES OF ARCTIC GRAYLING IN A SUB-ALPINE LAKE TRIBUTARY	NORTHWEST SCIENCE												Spawning Artic grayling Thymallus arcticus were uniquely marked in Upper Granite Lake, Washington (USA) to determine the movement, habitat utilization patterns, and reproductive strategies employed by individual fish. Prespawning behavior began in the shallows in the vicinity of the inlet stream as the lake became ice-free and spawning in the inlet stream persisted for approximately three weeks. Subdominant males held in refuge areas or actively cruised through the spawning grounds in search of mating opportunities. Dominant males were significantly larger, established territories, and enjoyed higher reproductive success than nonterritorial males. Dominant males were generally subdominant for periods before and after their territorial phase. Fifty-seven of the males defended territories at some time during the season. Both sexes spawned with a variety of mates. The number of spawners and level of activity in the stream was low in the morning and high in the midafternoon and evening. The distribution of spawners shifted downstream concurrently with a reduction in stream level; they were not observed in shallow riffles, or in stream velocities above 0.21 m/s. Proximity of refuge areas to male territories helped maintain a substantial number of females on the spawning grounds. The number of visually isolated breeding territories and refuges in feeder streams was controlled by the aggressive behavior of males which in turn limited the production of this population.																			0029-344X	2161-9859				AUG	1990	64	4					195	207																WOS:A1990EA00100003

IMPACT OF TRIPHENYLTIN HYDROXIDE .2. IMPACT OF DIFLUBENZURON AND TRIFLUMURON	HILGARDIA												An application of triphenyltin hydroxide at 1.16 kg (AI) ha to rice fields for stem rot (Sclerotium oryzae Catt.) control resulted in a significant reduction of 57% of the invertebrate taxa and 67% fewer individuals based on two collecting methods that sampled the nekton, neuston, and benthon. Populations of herbivores, carnivores, and filter feeders were sharply reduced after treatment, and most remained so through the 28th day following application. By day 50 many of the winged species recovered in both numbers and diversity. However, recovery of benthic organisms was slower or not at all for most Crustacea. An initial reduction followed by a strong resurgence was noted for the mosquito Culex tarsalis Coq., which was probably due to the significant reduction of five predaceous species. Two benzoylphenyl ureas, diflubenzuron and triflumuron, were evaluated in California rice fields to determine their ecological impact on populations of nontarget organisms. Modified minnow traps, drag net, and kellen dredge sampling devices were used in the collecting. Nontarget populations were sampled continuously throughout much of the 1985 and 1986 rice growing season. Total collections of non-targets showed only two Cypris species of seed shrimp crustaceans were significantly (P < 0.05) reduced over time due to either chemical. One predaceous water boatman, Corisella decolor, showed the opposite pattern in that populations were significantly (P < 0.05) lower in the control. Significant differences were not observed in species diversity or between treatments when grand means for all species by sampling device were calculated. A total of 35 families and 58 taxa were collected from these two studies.																			0073-2230					AUG	1990	58	1					1	36																WOS:A1990EW68800001
J	ZEIKUS, JG; WINFREY, MR				ZEIKUS, JG; WINFREY, MR			TEMPERATURE LIMITATION OF METHANOGENESIS IN AQUATIC SEDIMENTS	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Microbial methanogenesis was examined in sediments collected from Lake Mendota, Wisconsin, [USA] at water depths of 5, 10 and 18 m. The rate of sediment methanogenesis varied with respect to sediment site and depth, sampling date, in situ temperature and number of methanogens. Increased numbers of methanogenic bacteria and rates of methanogenesis correlated with increased sediment temperature during seasonal change. The greatest methanogenic activity was observed for 18-m sediments throughout the sampling year. As compared with shallower sediments, 18-m sediment was removed from oxygenation effects and contained higher amounts of ammonia, carbonate and methanogenic bacteria, and the population density of methanogens fluctuated less during seasonal change. Rates of methanogenesis in 18-m sediment cores decreased with increasing sediment depth. The optimum temperature, 35-42.degree. C, for sediment methanogenesis was considerably higher than the maximum observed in situ temperature of 23.degree. C. The conversion of H2 and [14C]carbonate to [14C]methane displayed the same temperature optimum when these substrates were added to sediments. The predominant methanogenic population had simple nutritional requirements and were metabolically active at 4-45.degree. C. Hydrogen oxidizers were the major nutritional type of sediment methanogens, formate and methanol fermentors were present, but acetate fermentors were not observed. Methanobacterium spp. were most abundant in sediments although Methanosarcina, Methanococcus and Methanospirillum spp. were observed in enrichment cultures. A chemolithotropic species of Methanosarcina and Methanobacterium was isolated in pure culture that displayed temperature optima above 30.degree. C and had simple nutritional requirements.																			0099-2240	1098-5336					1976	31	1					99	107		10.1128/AEM.31.1.99-107.1976	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.31.1.99-107.1976								821396					WOS:A1976BG56000018

Food habits and trophic resource partitioning among three mormyrid fishes from man-made Lake Ayame, Ivory Coast	AFRICAN ZOOLOGY												Feeding habits and trophic relationships among three mormyrid species (Petrocephalus bovei, Marcusenius assheri and Marcusenius furcidens) were assessed in the man-made Lake Ayame in Ivory Coast. The index of preponderance combining the occurrence and weight percentages of the identified prey items showed that these three mormyrid species mainly feed on invertebrates, especially aquatic insects. Petrocephalus bovei mainly feeds on chaoborid larvae, whereas both Marcusenius species preferentially feed on chironomid larvae. This segregation of food items associated with the relative abundance of chironomid larvae may reduce interspecific competition between these three fish species, and may therefore allow their coexistence. Horn's food overlap index revealed highly significant similarities in the trophic spectrum between both Marcusenius species, and for the dry as well as the rainy season.																			1562-7020	2224-073X				OCT	2006	41	2					266	274		10.3377/1562-7020(2006)41[266:FHATRP]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3377/1562-7020(2006)41[266:FHATRP]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000241886700013

Rates of DIC transport ranged from < 0.2 to 7.8 .mu.ol .cntdot. L-1 .cntdot. d-1, with the maximum always at 0-1 m. Nitrate and ammonium transport rates ranged from < 0.1 to 3 and 0.4 to 8 nmol .cntdot. L-1 .cntdot. d-1, with the vertical pattern variable. For the 1980 and 1981 investigate periods, DIC transport was 622 and 504 mmol .cntdot. m-2 (7.5 and 6.0 g C .cntdot. m-2), making Toolik one of the most oligotrophic lakes on record. DIN transport for the respective years was 34 and 41 mmol .cntdot. m-2, giving molar C/N transport ratios of 18 and 12. For both years, .**GRAPHIC**. was < 20% of total DIN transport.

Field observations of its seasonal and spatial distribution indicated that it should have a low temperature and a high irradiance optimum for net photosynthesis, and at temperatures > 10.degree. C it should show an increasingly unfavorable energy balance. Measurements of net photosynthesis and respiration were made at 56 combinations of light and temperature. Optimum conditions were 5.degree. C and 1100 .mu.E .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. s-1 at which net photosynthesis was 16.8 mg O2 .cntdot. g-1 .cntdot. h-1. As temperature increased to > 5.degree. C optimum irradiance decreased to 125 .mu.E .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. s-1 at 30.degree. C. Respiration rates increased with both temperature and prior irradiance. Light-enhanced respiration rates were significantly greater than dark respiration rates following irradiance exposure of .gtoreq. 125 .mu.E .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. s-1.

Three studies of its crustacean zooplankton, in 1955-56, 1967-69, and 1994-95 have been made. Despite increased eutrophication since the first study, species composition has not changed: the calanoid copepod, Calamoecia lucasi, dominates for much of the year and Bosmina cf. meridionalis and Ceriodaphnia cf. dubia are the only limnetic cladocerans. Comparison of their annual cycles in abundance between the studies show little regularity in the seasonal patterns, suggesting that stochastic events, such as storms, may be the most important controlling factors through their effects on food levels.																			0028-8330					SEP	1999	33	3					361	373		10.1080/00288330.1999.9516883	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1999.9516883													WOS:000083091200004
J	Peinador, M				Peinador, M			Cyanobacteria as bioindicators of organic pollution	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												In two Costa Rican rivers used as receptors for domestic sewage, treated by primary stabilization ponds, were taken a total of 28 samplings located at the pond exit and at three different sites in each river: 100 m before the ponds discharge, at the discharge and 100 m after the discharge. These sampling were done for a five and a half years including dry and rainy seasons. In each sampling site, samples were collected of five different substrates: stones, submerge and semi submerge vegetation, tree trunks or sticks, water and artificial substrates. For each sample were used two types of artificial cultures, WC and BG110. A total of 55 cyanobacteria species isolations were obtained, belonging to a 26 genera, between these the most common were Phormidium with nine species, Microcystis with five species, Leptolyngbya and Pseudanabaena with four species each and Oscillatoria with three species. More cyanobacteria species were isolated in water substrate and less isolations in tree trunks and submerge vegetation. Konvophoron Cyanarcus and Pilgeria only were isolate from water samples inoculated in culture media WC and in few opportunities, while three Leptolyngbya species and four Phormidium species were isolated very often. At the stabilization ponds Phormidium sp4 was dominant in 25 of 28 sampling while in the last others were the chlorophycea I. In this study were observed an increase in the frequency of cyanobacteria at the higher contamination places, and a species substitution between different sampling points. There were no biomass studies, therefore is not possible to relate between different cyanobacteria species and some specific types of water quality.																			0034-7744					SEP	1999	47	3					381	391											10883326					WOS:000085023200011
J	BELL, CM				BELL, CM			SALINE LAKE CARBONATES WITHIN AN UPPER JURASSIC LOWER CRETACEOUS CONTINENTAL RED-BED SEQUENCE IN THE ATACAMA REGION OF NORTHERN CHILE	SEDIMENTOLOGY												The Codocedo Limestone Member is a thin but laterally persistent lacustrine sequence within the red beds of the Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous Quebrada Monardes Formation, in the Atacama region of northern Chile. The thick succession of clastic terrigenous sediments of the Quebrada Monardes Formation was deposited in an arid to semi-arid environment. Sedimentary facies are indicative of deposition of aeolian dunes, alluvial fans and braided streams, playa-lake mudflats, and saline lakes and coastal lagoons. The strata accumulated in a N-S elongated extensional back-arc basin on the landward side of an active volcanic arc. The 3 m thick Codocedo Limestone Member marks striking facies changes within the Quebrada Monardes Formation. It is underlain by a thick sequence of conglomerates and sandstones, deposited on alluvial fans. The limestone itself is characterized by evaporite minerals and laterally continuous laminations, indicative or deposition by vertical accretion in a perennial saline lake. The overlying siltstones and fine sandstones contain geodes and gypsum pseudomorphs and were deposited on playa-lake mudflats. The limestone therefore represents a relatively short period of lacustrine depostion within an essentially terrigenous succession. The lake was possibly formed quite suddenly, for example by damming of the basin by lava flow. Sedimentation in the perennial lake was predominantly cyclical. Seasonal planktonic algal blooms produced millimetre-scale laminations. Interbedded with thse laminites and centimetre-scale beds of evaporitic gypsum, anhydrite and minor halite. The evaporite minerals have been largely replaced by calcite, chalcedony and quartz. The centimetre-scale cycles may have resulted from periodic freshwater input into the lake. After a period of about 3000 yr the lake dried up, up to be replaced by extensive playa-lake mudflats. The Codocedo Limestone Member possiblyformed a plane of detachment during an early Tertiary phase of E-W directed regional compression. The limestones and evaporites were folded and extensively brecciated. this deformation probably resulted from simple sheart along the bedding plane of the relatively weak evaporite minerals prior to their replacement by calcite and quartz.																			0037-0746	1365-3091				AUG	1989	36	4					651	663		10.1111/j.1365-3091.1989.tb02091.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3091.1989.tb02091.x													WOS:A1989AH77100009
J	HYATT, KD; RINGLER, NH				HYATT, KD; RINGLER, NH			EGG CANNIBALISM AND THE REPRODUCTIVE STRATEGIES OF THREESPINE STICKLEBACKS (GASTEROSTEUS-ACULEATUS) IN A COASTAL BRITISH-COLUMBIA LAKE	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Patterns of egg eating and their association with differences in sex, size, abundance, and reproductive status of free-ranging sticklebacks from Kennedy Lake, British Columbia, were examined as a means of identifying the relative importance of filial cannibalism or heterocannibalism as the source of eggs in the diet. Egg cannibalism was a common event: 23.0 and 11.2% of the sticklebacks examined in 1982 and 1985, respectively, had engaged in egg eating. Eggs were a substantial part of the overall diet of the stickleback population during two breeding seasons: 27.4% of the diet of all fish by weight in 1982, 32.8% on the diet by volume in 1985. Our results do not support Rohwer''s contention that filial cannibalism is the source of most eggs in stickleback diets. Ten out of 11 predictions based on the filial cannibalism hypothesis were rejected, whereas the 11th was compatible with either the filial cannibalism hypothesis or the alternative heterocannibalism hypothesis. We conclude that heterocannibalism, not filial cannibalism, is the major source of eggs in the diet of Kennedy Lake sticklebacks. We suggest that nest raiding and egg cannibalism may minimize time spent foraging and maximize time spent on activities that increase the probability of initiating and successfully completing one or more reproductive cycles. Although the benefits of nest raiding and cannibalism are most obvious for populations breeding under conditions where food supplies clearly limit their potential reproductive output, the benefits may still apply even under conditions where alternative prey sources appear to be abundant.																			0008-4301	1480-3283				AUG	1989	67	8					2036	2046		10.1139/z89-290	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z89-290													WOS:A1989AJ16800029
J	de Lozada, DS; Baveye, P; Lucey, RF; Mamani, R; Fernandez, W				de Lozada, Diego Sanchez; Baveye, Philippe; Lucey, Robert F.; Mamani, Ricardo; Fernandez, Walter			Potential limitations for potato yields in raised soil field systems near Lake Titicaca	SCIENTIA AGRICOLA												During the last two decades, various non-governmental organizations have strongly encouraged Bolivian farmers in the Altiplano region near Lake Titicaca to resume the ancestral agricultural practice of constructing raised fields. In addition to improved drainage and possibilities this practice affords for sub-irrigation, advocated benefits of this system traditionally include frost mitigation and high crop yields. Until recently, reliable data to assess the extent of these benefits were unfortunately lacking. In this context, field experiments on raised fields were designed and carried out at two locations in the Bolivian Altiplano to obtain reliable potato yield and temperature data. Observed yields ranged from 2.73 to 10.80 t ha(-1) at the first site, where salinity caused significant yield variability (R-2 = 0.79). At the second site, yields per raised platform varied between 8.25 and 33.45 t ha(-1). However, comparable yields were obtained in flat control plots in spite of a mid-season frost, and the minimum temperatures differed only by 1 degrees C in the conventional plots relative to the raised fields. These results suggest that, under the experimental conditions, the potential benefits of raised fields in terms of frost mitigation or increased yields might only be observable in exceptionally bad years, when extreme frosts wipe out entire potato crops on conventional fields. Nevertheless, it is argued that in spite of these marginally supportive observations, raised-field agriculture may still be a viable option for farmers to consider if the water-filled channels between the raised fields are managed for fish and fertilizer production.

J	Villalobos, GU				Villalobos, Gerardo Umana			Yearly cycle of stratification and circulation at Arenal Reservoir, Costa Rica	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												The behavior of the water column of Arenal Reservoir, a tropical reservoir in Costa Rica, is analyzed based on temperature and dissolved oxygen data gathered on a monthly to bimonthly basis between 1986 and 1992. The depth profiles of temperature at Arenal Reservoir show the typical asymmetry of reservoirs, with a greater stratification in its deeper part near the dam, even though the main outflow is located at its head at the northwest end instead of the dam. A comparison of sampling stations at both ends show a deeper circulation pattern at the northern end. This coincides with other reports of a tilted structure of the thermal isopleth pattern in front of the water outlet. The dissolved oxygen showed some degree of anoxia at the bottom during part of the year, mainly from May until October. This was caused by the decomposition of the organic matter accumulated at the bottom at the time, mainly as remains of the vegetation from the former lagoon that was not removed before flooding. The stratification is clearly seasonal, occurring during the rainy season (April to October), specially in the deeper zones of the reservoir.																			0034-7744	2215-2075				SEP	2006	54			1			257	263																WOS:000250229500016

This process has been studied in triaxial tests on undisturbed specimens of a natural clay from Bluefish Lake, 50 km north of Yellowknife, N.W.T. Specimens were first anisotropically consolidated to low stresses that correspond to conditions at shallow depths in creeping slopes. Pore-water pressures (back pressures) in the specimens were then cycled systematically (over periods lasting 4-48 h) with the drainage leads open. Resulting axial and volumetric strains were measured, and shear and lateral strains deduced from them. Strain rates decreased with increasing total times of testing. They increased with increasing values of the ratio DELTA-u/DELTA-u(f), with increasing values of deviator stress q, and with decreasing values of K = sigma-3c'/sigma-1c'. Systematically increasing the pore-water pressures in the specimens produced clear estimates of failure at low stresses.																			0008-3674					APR	1992	29	2					326	333		10.1139/t92-037	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/t92-037													WOS:A1992HX31500017

The river receives both point source and nonpoint source input of nutrients. Data were used to characterize the water quality and trophic state in the river. In addition nitrification, denitrification, and nitrogen assimilation rates were estimated. Transformations of added [N-15]-labelled nitrogen in water and sediment were measured seasonally at sites on the Calcasieu River. Nitrification rates were determined by adding (NH4+)-N-15 and measuring the rate of (NO3)-N-15 appearamce. Denitrification was determined using N-15 tracer and acetylene blockage techniques. Nitrification occurred in the oxidized surface of the bottom sediment from the Calcasieu River and minimally in the overlying water. Nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the river suggest that the Calcasieu River may become eutrophic unless means are taken for reducing nutrient loading into the system. Results show the importance of nitrification and denitrification reactions in minimizing the effect of nitrogen input.

The authors have therefore conducted weekly observations on four rivers flowing into lakes during a 1-year period. A remarkable statistical characteristic for input loads of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus, from the four river basins, was their dependence on discharge. Loads of three elements in the inflow rivers to Lake Kasumigaura were measured by four seasonal observations in the year. The TOC:T-N:T-P ratios of inflow nutrients were 27-45:8-32:1 using both arithmetic and discharge-weighted mean concentrations. The TOC:T-N:T-P ratios for the whole of the lake and for a bay receiving inflow from three rivers were estimated on the basis of monthly observations. Most of the inflow loads of particulate nutrients were deposited in the river mouth, whereas the inflow loads of dissolved nutrients and production-degradation processes of organic matter largely controlled the nutrient budget in the lake water by comparison of the ratios for surface mud, phytoplankton and detritus.																			0043-1354					JAN	1991	25	1					95	100		10.1016/0043-1354(91)90104-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(91)90104-X													WOS:A1991EV03100015

Ecological associations of Parthenium in various localities of Salt Lake City were also investigated. Aerobiological survey was done using a Burkard seven day Volumetric Spore Trap, with the object to record the occurrence of Parthenium pollen in the air of Salt Lake in different seasons along with other airborne types. A total of 45 pollen and 60 fungal spore types were trapped and recorded. The frequency of grass and cyperaceous pollen were found to be dominant followed by Trema.

At present, some 5500 ha of previously almost denuded, salty, semi-arid land (precipitation: 527 mm/yr) have been covered (to more than 90%) with native grass. In addition, since 1980 a large (1000 ha) rectangular lake and several (5) smaller ponds (total area 500 ha) have been constructed within this "enclosure" adjacent (and upwind) to the capital city. The additional moisture supplied by the water bodies is of the order of about 40 000 m3/day plus 90 000 m3/day from evapotranspiration of new grass-covered surfaces, and is likely to have affected favorably the environment in the vicinity of the airport. The fenced area used to be the most important source for the generation of atmospheric dust which plagued the capital city during the dry season. At present, dust storms coming from this direction have drastically reduced their frequency. According to current thought, the changes in albedo and infrared emission caused by vegetating a previously bare region result in an increase in net radiation absorbed at the surface. This increase in available energy is used for evaporation and, depending on the type and cover of vegetation, to heat the air. The new vegetated cover would result in a moister lower atmosphere with higher equivalent potential temperature. In the 14-year period, the fenced area of ex-Lake Texcoco is likely to have gradually changed its albedo to a lower value, particularly the grass-covered area during the wet season, thus inducing an observed increase in air temperature (up to 1.5-degrees-C in mean maximum temperature at the site near the lakes and downwind at the airport station). The construction of lakes and ponds has augmented advection of moisture downwind at the airport, which is observed both as an increase of mean dew-point temperatures (1-2-degrees-C), as well as a higher occurrence of ground fog. Moreover, the new mesoscale moisture contrast is also likely to have induced a circulation which, in weak synoptic flow situations, may have been partly responsible for an observed increase (downwind) in precipitation during the dry months.																			0378-7788						1991	15	3-4					447	455																WOS:A1991FZ90700020

The lake is a warm (annual temperature range 7 to 35.degree.C), shallow, monomictic reservoir with limited macrophyte development in the littoral zone. Samples were collected from 6 depths within the photic zone from a site located over the deepest portion of the lake. Primary production and exudate production were calculated from NaH14CO3 incorporation. Bacterial production was calculated from [methyl-3H]-thymidine incorporation. Depth averaged primary production ranged from a seasonal low of 9.0 .mu.g C l-1 h-1 in January to a seasonal maximum of 153 .mu.g C l-1 h-1 during holomixis in September. Annual depth-averaged production was 67.8 .+-. 7.3 .mu.g C l-1 h-1. Exudate production ranged between 21.9 and 54.2% of primary production and annually averaged 30.8%. Bacterial production ranged between 1.7 and 46.0 .mu.g C l-1 h-1 and annually averaged 16.0 .+-. 1.9 .mu.g C l-1 h-1. Bacteria processed approximately 70% of exudate and incorporated 35% into biomass. Bacterial production was positively correlated with total primary production (r = 0.38, p < 0.003, n = 6), particulate primary production (r = 0.34, p < 0.004, n = 70) and bacterial uptake of exudate (r = 0.43, p < 0.001, n = 68). While exudate was readily utilized by bacteria it did not appear to be produced in sufficient quantity or at a sufficient rate to serve as the sole or a major source of carbon supporting bacterial growth.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUL 21	1989	179	1					61	71		10.1007/BF00011930	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00011930													WOS:A1989AL26400006
J	MACINTYRE, S; MELACK, JM				MACINTYRE, S; MELACK, JM			MEROMIXIS IN AN EQUATORIAL AFRICAN SODA LAKE	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Lake Sonachi, a small volcanic crater lake in central Kenya, was chemically stratified on all of 17 sampling dates spanning 8 yr. Values of chemical stability, the amount of work required to mix a stratified lake to a uniform concentration, were low (700-200,300 ergs .cntdot. cm-2). Factors that contribute to the maintenance of meromixis are basin morphometry, the diurnal periodicity of the winds and of thermal stratification, biological decomposition, and seasonal and yearly changes in rainfall. Lake Sonachi is sheltered from wind by crater walls 30-115 m above its surface. Wind speeds have a diurnal pattern and typically were maximal when the lake was thermally stratified. Higher values of hydrogen sulfide, soluble reactive phosphate, and ammonia in the deeper waters, as well as a lower pH value, suggest that biological processes contributed to the meromixis. Rainfall during 1971-1976 totaled less than average, and chemical stability declined to 700 ergs .cntdot. cm-2. When the lake was again sampled after 2 yr of above average and 1 yr of average rainfall, the level had risen 3 m and the stability had increased to 200,300 ergs .cntdot. cm-2. Freshening of the surface waters by rain contributed to the increased stability, and the conductivity and the volume of water below the chemocline had increased substantially. Chemical stratification is enhanced by ground-waters that dissolve evaporites in the lake sediments and seep into the lake.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1982	27	4					595	609		10.4319/lo.1982.27.4.0595	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1982.27.4.0595													WOS:A1982NY08300001
J	DICK, TA; PAPST, MH; PAUL, HC				DICK, TA; PAPST, MH; PAUL, HC			RAINBOW-TROUT (SALMO-GAIRDNERI) STOCKING AND CONTRACAECUM SPP	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES												A stocking program with rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) at High Rock Lake, Manitoba [Canada] failed due to infections with large numbers of Contracaecum spp. larval. Nematode larvae in the intestinal tract, body cavity and musculature made the fish unmarketable. A combination of experimental infections of rainbow trout and pelican (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos), observations on the behavior of fish-eating birds, and numbers of larval Contracaecum spp, in minnow species led to the following conclusions. The introduction of rainbow trout attracted large numbers of fish-eating birds, particularly pelicans. Concurrent predation by rainbow trout on fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas), five-spined sticklebacks (Culaea inconstans), and nine-spined sticklebacks (Pungitus pungitius), concentrated the parasites. The combined increase in densities of the introduced fish host and fish-eating birds, and the short life cycle of the parasite, increased the numbers of parasites in rainbow trout over a season and in the indigenous minnow species between years. Numbers of larvae in the indigenous minnow species declined when stocking of rainbow trout was stopped and use of the lake by fish-eating birds, particularly pelican, returned to normal levels.																			0090-3558	1943-3700				APR	1987	23	2					242	247		10.7589/0090-3558-23.2.242	http://dx.doi.org/10.7589/0090-3558-23.2.242								3586201					WOS:A1987H002600011

Analysis of diatom algae from the water column and bottom sediments of Shira Lake (Khakassia, Russia)	Contemporary Problems of Ecology												Lake Shira as a meromictic lake is object of interest for paleolimnological studies. In May 2011 core samples were collected from the bottom of Lake Shira and the species composition of diatom algae, which serve as bioindicators of the state of the lake, were studied. In addition, in 2012, seasonal water samples and material from sediment traps were collected and the species composition of diatoms in them was analyzed. The results of the analysis showed that the lake, like in previous years of research, was dominated by Cyclotella choctawhatcheeana Prasad. Diatoms were found twice in the studied core above the white carbonate layers and were absent in other layers. The species living in the lake at present were observed down to the first white carbonate layer, including the predominant Cyclotella choctawhatcheeana. This fact presumably proves the consistency of the species composition of diatoms and the overall stable condition of the lake since 1946 (Rogozin et al., 2005). Down to the second white carbonate layer, the dominant species were Aulcosira valida (Grunow) Krammer and Aulcosira italica (Grunow) Simonsen. Nitzchia sigmodea (Nitzsch) W. Smith and Fragilaria construens var. venter (Ehrenberg) Grunow were also observed at these depths, dating approximately to 1655-1690. These are freshwater species that belong to the diatoms of arctic, alpine, and temperate latitudes, which develop in shallow waters under moderate temperature conditions. This fact suggests that Lake Shira was less salty in the middle and end of the 17th century than today.

J	Langseth, BJ; Cottrill, A				Langseth, Brian J.; Cottrill, Adam			Influence of fishing practices on lake trout bycatch in the Canadian lake-whitefish commercial fishery in Lake Huron	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Rehabilitation of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) populations is a priority for fisheries management in the upper Laurentian Great Lakes. In Lake Huron, lake trout are frequently caught as bycatch in the commercial fishery for lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis). Given the frequency of lake trout capture and the importance of limiting mortality for achieving rehabilitation goals, understanding factors that affect lake trout bycatch is valuable. We used catch and effort data from commercial logbooks and onboard observer reports to assess potential effects of factors in the operation of the lake whitefish fishery on lake trout bycatch and to develop standardized indices of lake trout abundance. Factors considered in our analysis were season, mesh size, region, and license holder, which were recorded in both datasets, and set type and depth, which were only recorded in the observer dataset In general, we found that environmental factors affected whether lake trout bycatch occurred, but that if bycatch occurred, factors related to the fishing gear affected its magnitude. Although we observed seasonal interactions with depth and mesh size, the probability of bycatch was lowest in shallow waters, and the magnitude of bycatch was lowest in shallow waters, alternative set types, and larger mesh sizes. Standardized indices of lake trout abundance from both datasets gave comparable estimates of relative trends; an increase in abundance up to 2004-2005 followed by a decline. Our findings show utility for the use of the observer dataset from the lake whitefish fishery as part of lake trout management in Lake Huron.

J	RYDING, SO				RYDING, SO			CHEMICAL AND MICROBIOLOGICAL PROCESSES AS REGULATORS OF THE EXCHANGE OF SUBSTANCES BETWEEN SEDIMENTS AND WATER IN SHALLOW EUTROPHIC LAKES	INTERNATIONALE REVUE DER GESAMTEN HYDROBIOLOGIE												It is generally believed that excessive P release from lake sediments, i.e. internal P load, is only a problem in deep lakes with stagnant anaerobic bottom waters. However, sustantial amounts of P can also be released from sediments in shallow, well-mixed lakes. The dynamics and magnitude of P release from sediments in these types of lakes are affected primarily by physical factors, such as seasonal variations in water temperature and year-to-year differences in water renewal. These factors, in turn, induce chemical and microbiological processes which regulate the exchange of substances between sediments and water. The fractional distribution of sedimentary P and the chelating capacity of the water are also important factors that can provide insights to the processes involved and their quantitative impact on the P status in shallow, eutrophic lakes.																			0020-9309						1985	70	5					657	702		10.1002/iroh.19850700506	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19850700506													WOS:A1985AWB4700003

Time taken for 50 and 90% dissipation ranged from 1.65 and 3.65 days, respectively, at 0.5 .mu.g/l to 3.5 and 6.75 days, respectively, at 50 .mu.g/l. Inter- and intra-seasonal replication of dissipation patterns was good. Rate of dissipation varied slightly with depth, normally being slower at greater depth. Absorption of permethrin to sediments was rapid, penetration shallow, and disappearance slow. Permethrin had no effect on water chemistry but there was an increase in the Secchi disk depth in the treated limnocorrals. Dissolved inorganic C decreased in all limnocorrals, including controls after treatment, suggesting precipitation of CaCO3 which may act as a scavenging agent for permethrin in the water. Limnocorrals are a useful tool for evaluating the behavior of pesticides in aquatic systems.

J	Löhlein, B				Löhlein, B			Assessment of secondary production of Naididae (Oligochaeta): an example from a North German lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The annual production of the Naididae Chaetogaster diastrophus, Nais spp., and Stylaria lacustris inhabiting the aufwuchs on reed stems in eutrophic Lake Belau (northern Germany) was estimated. For this purpose, field biomass data taken at biweekly intervals were combined with data on growth potentials of Naididae. From biomass doubling times of laboratory cultures (own and literature) at different temperatures, relationships between temperature and instantaneous growth rate r were developed. Based on these functions, the temperature conditions in Lake Belau over 1993 were assessed to allow for the development of 66 generations of C. diastrophus, 42 of Nais spp. and 30 of S. lacustris, respectively. Corresponding annual turnover rates (P/B) are 108 for C. diastrophus, 96 for Nais spp., and 78 for S. lacustris, respectively. However, field data from Lake Belau provide evidence for a food limitation of naidid populations after their abundance peaks. Thus, Naididae can probably not realize their growth potentials over the whole season. Different scenarios of naidid production for various assumed food-limited growth rates are calculated. Under the assumption that no further production occurs once peak densities are reached, annual production on the reed stems in 1993 amounted to 287 mu g dry mass cm(-2) a(-1). This value represents only 21% of the potential production of 1342 mu g dry mass cm(-2) a(-1). The true production of aufwuchs-associated Naididae in Lake Belau lies between these values.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUL	1999	406						191	198		10.1023/A:1003736217476	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003736217476													WOS:000084469500021
J	Kepner, RL; Pratt, JR				Kepner, RL; Pratt, JR			Characterization of surface-associated protozoan communities in a Lake Erie coastal wetland (Old Woman Creek, Ohio)	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Examination of surface-associated protozoa in Great Lakes coastal marshes has been minimal, although they play crucial roles in nutrient and energy transfer in similar systems. Spatio-temporal patterns of artificial substrate-associated protist and bacterial abundances are related to physicochemical conditions at this ''freshwater estuary.'' Assemblages were sampled monthly (May-October) at upstream, downstream and at two mid-estuarine sites. A total of 278 protistan taxa were observed, and greatest richness occur red in late June. Richness at the estuary mouth was consistently higher than npstream, possibly due to the influence of Lake Erie assemblages and variability in hydrology-driven habitat characteristics. PCA yielded two components accounting for 90% of total variance in species by sites data. Species abundances at the two mid-estuarine sites were most highly correlated, and taxa seasonally abundant at any one site tended to be abundant at others. Presence/absence data were wed to calculate community similarity indices, and a permutation-computed test statistic compared the mean similarity of triplicate substrates in one month (at a given site) to the between-month similarity. Significant differences (alpha = 0.05) between some months (site by site) were observed with a unique assemblage noted in October. Following classification into six functional feeding groups, bactivores (mainly heterotrophic microflagellates) and primary producers (mainly cryptomonads and chlamydomonads) dominated assemblages. Organisms in other functional groups comprised only 10-15% of observed taxa. A preponderance of bactivorous taxa is consistent with observations of a dense and metabolically active bacterial community associated with abundant particulate organic matter in easily resuspended surficial sediments.																			0380-1330						1996	22	1					63	76		10.1016/S0380-1330(96)70935-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(96)70935-8													WOS:A1996UE69200008
J	Lindstrom, EA				Lindstrom, EA			The humic lake acidification experiment (HUMEX): Impacts of acid treatment on periphyton growth and nutrient availability in Lake Skjervatjern, Norway	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL					5th Nordic Symposium on Humic Substances in Soil and Water / HUMEX/HUMOR Project Seminar	JUN 06-08, 1995	UNIV LUND, LUND, SWEDEN		UNIV LUND			The aim of the Humic Lake Acidification Experiment (HUMEX) was to study the role of humic substances in the acidification of surface waters, and the impacts of acid deposition on chemical and biological properties of humic water. The dystrophic Lake Skjervatjern, Norway, was separated into two basins by a plastic curtain in 1988, and acid treatment of one basin with sulphuric acid and ammonium nitrate started in 1990. Shortly after the onset of the acid treatment, an extensive growth of filamentous green algae occurred in the acidified basin. Clay flower pots filled with nutrient diffusing agar were used to study periphyton growth. Additions of ammonium, nitrate, and bicarbonate, as well as two parallel releases of phosphate were tested. The control basin (B) proved to be N limited for most of the growth season. Consistently higher accumulation of chlorophyll a per area in the acidified basin (A) than in the control, is suggested to be due to N fertilization by the acid treatment (addition of NH4NO3). Both the untreated and acidified basins showed pronounced seasonal and temporal variations in nutrient limitation. The assumption that low bioavailability of DIC limits primary production in acidified water was not confirmed for acid humic water. A large increase in areal chlorophyll a in the acidified basin in 1994 occurred simultaneously with increased nutrient supply, particularly ammonia and TP. This is hypothesized to be caused, at least partly, by changed metabolism in the acidified environment, probably by reduced/disrupted nitrification.																			0160-4120						1996	22	5					629	642		10.1016/0160-4120(96)00054-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0160-4120(96)00054-2													WOS:A1996VG55900021

From 1988 to 1990, its bleeding biology was examined at the artificial Lake of Kerkini, northern Greece where it nests in a mixed-species colony composed of 12 species of waterbird. The height of the cormorant nests above the ground varied from 2.2 to 5.5 m. The water depth varied from 1.0 m at the beginning of the laying period to 3.0 m by the middle of the breeding season. Mean egg measurements were 46.5 x 30.6 nm. Mean clutch sire was 5.3 eggs (range: 2 to 8); clutches of 5 and 6 were the most common. Almost 77% of the 867 eggs laid in 165 nests observed over three years hatched. Survival of chicks, to three weeks of age was 69% of the eggs laid and 89.8% of eggs hatched. Flooding of nests was the major mortality factor. Decreasing the maximum water level and the duration of the flooding at that level is necessary to prevent the destruction of the flooded forest.																			0738-6028						1996	19				1		219	223		10.2307/1521965	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1521965													WOS:A1996VL28700027

A selected subset of 77 taxa were clustered using a complete-linkage cluster analysis. The final 12 clusters represent the associations of species found occurring together in insular Newfoundland. Physical, chemical, and morphometric data collected with the phytoplankton served to characterize the environment. Factor analysis samplified the original variables, many of which were highly correlated and uninterpretable, into seven derived environmental factors: dystrophy, hardness, salinity, lake size, season, watershed influence, and orthophosphate enrichment. The resulting orthogonally rotated (VARIMAX) scores comprising these seven factors were correlated with species abundances. Spearman correlations showed several relationships between species distributions and the seven derived environmental factors. Although the analysis identified a subset of naturally acidic, dystrophic lakes, it failed to reveal any evidence of anthropogenic acidification in the lakes studied. For the most part, the members from each of the cluster groups demonstrated similar relationships with the derived environmental factors. The evidence suggests that the cluster groups may represent species associations; groups of species that co-occur because of their common requirements for specific environmental conditions. Phytoplankton autecological findings resulting from this study of insular Newfoundland lakes correspond well with conclusions derived independently from a comparable study of 95 headwater lakes in Labrador.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				MAR	1987	44	3					639	649		10.1139/f87-078	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f87-078													WOS:A1987H126800018

Aerial surveys provided just eight tentative sightings in 73 hours of searching. These discouraging results may have been due to poor visibility, small populations, and perhaps reduced dry season manatee activity. Results of interview survey, however, permitted a number of important generalizations. A remnant manatee population exists in Lake Maracaibo, but none occur along the more than 1500 km of Caribbean coastline. Abundance is greatest in eastern Venezuela bordering the Golfo de Paria, in the Orinoco Delta, and in the middle Orinoco and tributaries. Local market hunting in the middle of this century probably greatly reduced manatee populations in these areas. Recent protection laws, education efforts, and manatee scarcity have resulted in a declining interest in manatee hunting. Much excellent manatee habitat persists in these regions, and a continued decline in hunting could result in an optimistic outlook for future manatee populations if the incidental take in net fisheries is controlled. Traditional beliefs and legends concerning manatees in Venezuela, including hunting taboos, show that these animals remain a colorful part of the folk culture. However, manatee protection does not pose economic hardships or infringe upon traditional spiritual beliefs.

J	STRACHAN, WMJ				STRACHAN, WMJ			TOXIC CONTAMINANTS IN RAINFALL IN CANADA - 1984	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Replicate rain samples for most of the 1984 wetfall season were collected from four widely separated sites in Canada, and concentrations and loadings of a number of polychlorinated biphenyls and organochlorine pesticides were determined for each location. Comparisons were made among the sites and with results from other years. The major contaminants in 1984 were, in order of concentration, .alpha.-hexachlorocyclohexane (.alpha.-HCH or .alpha.-BHC), lindane and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Found at lower levels were dieldrin, methoxychlor (in the Lake Superior area), DDT residues, endrin (especially at Kouchibouguac), hepatchlor epxodide and hexachlorobenzene. The loading of the .alpha.-HCH/lindane pair was higher at the Atlantic coastal site than at the other locations, possibly because of the greater precipitation there. No geographic trend for PCBs was apparent. For the other substances, no significant pattern to the differences betwen sites can be discerned. The qualitative similarities of concentrations and loadings at the widely separated locations, however, suggest long-range atmospheric transport. A comparison between results from two Lake Superior sites indicated no shoreline effect on the concentrations of over-lake versus shoreline samples. The differences observed were in accord with those observed in 1983 and were attributed to lack of replenishment from the lake surface.																			0730-7268	1552-8618					1988	7	11					871	877		10.1002/etc.5620071103	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/etc.5620071103													WOS:A1988Q541200003

Lake Manzala is situated at the northern part of the Nile-delta, Egypt. Disposal of treated sewage into Lake Manzala appeared to have differential effects on water quality and phytoplankton populations. Marked seasonal and local variations were observed for the physical and chemical characteristics of water. 157 species of algae were identified, 59 Chlorophyta, 37 Bacillariophyta, 30 Cyanophyta (Cyanobacteria), 28 Euglenophyta, one Pyrrhophyta and 2 Cryptophyta. Distribution and abundance of these algal divisions were found to differ at different sampling stations. Qualitative and quantitative growth of each algal division displayed great seasonal variations. The phytoplankton standing crop was mainly due to the contribution of Bacillariophyta whereas the species composition is dependent mainly on Chlorophyta. A great parallelism was noted between the quality of water samples based upon the chemical and physical investigations and their quality based upon the biological indices. Compound eutrophication index indicated that the nature of the investigated water ranged between eutrophic and hypereutrophic conditions. Diversity index values indicated that the water in the study area was of a moderate level of pollution. Saprobic index and saprobic quotient revealed the presence of beta- to alpha- mesosaprobic forms of algae.

Biomass, productivity, and nutrient allocation in subalpine shrublands and meadows of the Emerald Lake Basin, Sequoia National Park, California	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												The Emerald Lake Basin provides a long-term site for research on hydrology, ecology, and biogeochemistry, as well as baseline data for a representative subalpine watershed in the Sierra Nevada of California. Field studies provided quantitative data on the biomass, net primary production, and nutrient allocation of major subalpine shrub and meadow communities. Measurements carried out over two growing seasons found aboveground biomass per unit canopy area was 3857 g m(-2) in Chrysolepis sempervirens, 3360 g m(-2) in Salix orestera, and 1614 g m(-2) in Phyllodoce breweri. The biomass for Chrysolepis and Salix canopies were high compared to other published data for subalpine and alpine shrublands, but the Phyllodoce biomass was comparable to values for ericaceous heath in the Rocky Mountains and European Alps. Wet and dry meadows had 377 and 98 g m(-2), respectively, in aboveground living tissues, comparable to values from the Rocky Mountains and European Alps. Belowground biomass for shrub communities was the highest for Phyllodoce (3670 g m(-2)), followed by Chrysolepis (2400 g m(-2)) and Salix (2070 g m(-2)). The wet meadow community had a surprisingly high belowground biomass of 2897 g m(-2), reflecting the dominance of large perennial herb species. This resulted from a root: shoot ratio of 8.21 compared to 5.72 in the dry meadow community. Canopies of Chrysolepis and Salix had root: shoot ratios of 0.62 and 0.61, respectively, and Phyllodoce a ratio of 2.27.																			1523-0430	1938-4246				FEB	2015	47	1					115	123		10.1657/AAAR0013-136	http://dx.doi.org/10.1657/AAAR0013-136													WOS:000350219000010
J	BEST, RC				BEST, RC			APPARENT DRY-SEASON FASTING IN AMAZONIAN MANATEES (MAMMALIA, SIRENIA)	BIOTROPICA												Amazonian manatees (T. inunguis), restricted to deep water areas in the larger lakes in the central Amazon during the dry season, do not have any obvious food sources until water levels rise between 1-2 m. Evidence from Lago Amana [Brazil] suggests almost 7 mo. of fasting. Manatees may eat dead vegetative matter of both autochthonous and allochthonous origin, relying on hindgut fermentation to derive nutritive value from such material. The extremely low metabolic rate (36% of standard) and the large quantity of blubber may represent critical adaptations in the survival of this species during prolonged dry seasons. A fat manatee may survive up to 200 days before exhausting its lipid reserves.																			0006-3606	1744-7429					1983	15	1					61	64		10.2307/2388000	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2388000													WOS:A1983QU71200010

These species can be classified into 9 trophic groups. The phytoplankton/detritus eaters and the zooplanktophages (both belonging to the smaller species) form the dominant group in the sublittoral waters with a mud bottom, while insect eaters dominate in shallower water, especially over sand. Most haplochromine species appear to be strongly habitat-restricted throughout life. Breeding of the bulk of the haplochromine species (phytoplankton/detritus eaters, zooplanktophages and some insectivores) in the sublittoral and littoral waters with a mud bottom appears to be seasonal. Spawning takes place at the end of the rainy season. Some species of the littoral sand habitat breed throughout the year.

The lake was not fertilized in 1984. Average numbers of bacteria during the growing season decreased from a high of 1.53 .times. 106 .cntdot. mL-1 in the fertilized condition to 0.84 .times. 106 .cntdot. mL-1 in the unfertilized condition. Chlorophyll a concentrations decreased from a maximum seasonal average of 2.69 .mu.g .cntdot. L-1 (1981) to 1.30 .mu.g .cntdot. L-1 (1984), and algal numbers decreased from 5.83 .times. 104 .cntdot. mL-1 (1983) to 2.29 .times. 104 .cntdot. mL-1 (1984). Although the numbers of phytoplankton in each size fraction (picoplankton, nanoplankton, or microplankton) decreased in the unfertilized condition, the greatest change was an almost fourfold decrease in picoplankton, which consisted of 90% cyanobacteria (primarily Synechococcus spp.). Abundance of the large diatoms Rhizosolenia spp. and Melosira spp. increased in 1984, resulting in an increase in average seasonal algal volume. Average densities of medium (0.15-0.84 mm) and large (0.85-1.5 mm) zooplankton were greatest in 1982, while rotifers and small zooplankton (0.10-0.14 mm) were most dense in 1984 following nutrient reduction. The lake had relatively high concentrations of planktivorous juvenile sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) that appeared to minimize any direct effect of nutrient additions on zooplankton densities.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				AUG	1986	43	8					1504	1514		10.1139/f86-188	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f86-188													WOS:A1986D371100005

Feed intake and digestibility by sheep of natural vegetation in the riparian land of lake Naivasha, Kenya	SMALL RUMINANT RESEARCH												Riparian lands are key dry season feed resource areas in Kenya. The feed quality of pastures of Lake Naivasha riparian has previously not been studied. Chronosequence positions corresponding to 30, 25, 20, and 15 years of land use and four transects perpendicular to the chronosequence representing observed soil differences were selected, intersections forming forage sampling plots. A 4 x 4 Graeco-Latin square design experiment using sheep was conducted to determine voluntary intake, digestibility, and effects of land use duration and soil type. The sheep were housed in metabolic cages and fed for ad libitum intake. Feed intake and faecal output were recorded and samples taken for analysis. Land use duration did not affect dry matter (DM) and organic matter (OM) intake (DMI and OMI). The digestibility of DM and OM and of fibre fractions decreased with increased land use duration. Increased duration of exposure from lake recession and land use leads to increased forage fibre, reduced digestibility of DM and fibre fractions and reductions in Ca, K and P content but did not affect DM intake. Lake Naivasha riparian pastures would provide sufficient energy and can, with nitrogen supplementation, be a good feed resource for ruminants. Use of chronosequence approach provides an analytical framework to study effects of land use duration on feed quality. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The latter is associated with great dynamics, expressed through quantity, cyclicity (daily, seasonal, absolute), but also through the position within the bounds of a hydrological basin, especially in its floodplain. In potamology, one of the most dynamic processes is river meandering, its study being significant, from many perspectives. The importance of this subject is given by numerous aspects, such as the lateral dynamic, associated with bank erosion; the possibility that substantial areas of agricultural land can be affected; the contribution this phenomena has on erosion-transport-accumulation processes. Also, if not regulated through extensive hydrotechnical constructions (such as embankments or gabion walls), the meandering can cause damage to transportation networks (both road, and railway), generating territorial disfunctionalities, for short periods of time. Additionally, floods are frequent phenomena, which contribute to the change in direction and bend of the river bed, and, implicitly, to the river meandering. Despite its destructive implications, there are also positive consequences, related to highly meandering rivers. Among these, the most relevant is the occurrence of oxbow lakes, when a river bend collapses on itself, creating local ecosystems, which support biodiversity, or become potential water resources. The methodology for calculating the sinuosity ratio has been adapted to the irregular river valley shape, in order to minimize errors produced by the generalized sinuosity ratio formula. The evolution of the sinuosity ratio could be emphasized, by comparing the side-to-side movements over time, from several cartographic materials. Therefore, based on topographical maps, published in different time periods, the overall tendency of river meandering could be observed. The study area is the Tazlau river basin, and it has been chosen taking into consideration the sufficiently wide floodplain, which allows the river to exert a great lateral extent; the existence of large floods, in its brief history (such as the one in 1991, resulted in the breaking of Belci dam); and the cartographic materials, which are sufficiently extensive, therefore the analysis being possible for a period of over five decades.

Cluster and Non-matric Multi-Dimentional Scaling (MDS) methods were used respectively to do multivariate statistical analysis of the seasonal changes of community structure of periphytic algae. The periphytic algae communities of all the plots from different seasons were clusterred into several groups based on the different community structure. The contribution of five main factors, water temperature, air temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH and conductivity, on the distribution pattern were analyzed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method and the results showed that, the water temperature was the most effective in all four seasons. Taken together, the water quality in Jinyang Lake was still acceptable. However, more attention should be paid on proper development and usage of the touring and fishing resources.

Water extent is the key index to characterize the scale and intensity of drought disaster. The seasonal water change of Poyang Lake is obvious. There is high landscape heterogeneity because the terrain features distribution is highly complex and discontinuous in the dry season. At the same time spectral characteristics of water and its surroundings are complicated in that the microscopic formation mechanism of water is complicated. It is difficult to perform water information extraction. The commonly used water information extraction methods such as classification method, image segmentation method, threshold method, region growing method can't meet the requirements on the efficiency and accuracy. In this paper, Water information extraction and validation of 2011 was performed using HJ-1 CCD data based on decision tree method. Then temporal and spatial analysis of water extent was performed. At last, the relationship between the water extent and disaster loss information was analyzed. The results indicated that the decision tree method significantly improved the efficiency and accuracy compared to the traditional classification method and visual interpretation. It spent 2 hour in extracting water of dry season which need 2 days using visual interpretation method. The accuracy of the method was 94.5 percent of the accuracy using visual interpretation. It can meet the requirement of disaster reduction and solve the problem in dynamic extracting water extent of high landscape heterogeneity. There is high correlation between the temporal and spatial change of the water extent and the drought event.

Tunka-Rex Collaboration	Status and first results of Tunka-Rex, an experiment for the radio detection of air showers	13TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON TOPICS IN ASTROPARTICLE AND UNDERGROUND PHYSICS, TAUP 2013	Physics Procedia				13th International Conference on Topics in Astroparticle and Underground Physics (TAUP)	SEP 08-13, 2013	Monterey Peninsula, CA	Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab				Tunka-Rex is a new radio detector for extensive air showers from cosmic rays, built in 2012 as an extension to Tunka-133. The latter is a non-imaging air-Cherenkov detector, located near Lake Baikal, Siberia. With its 25 radio antennas, Tunka-Rex extends over an area of 1 km(2) with a spacing of 200 m and therefore is expected to be sensitive to an primary energy range of approximately 10(17)-10(18) eV. Using Trigger and DAQ from Tunka-133, this setup allows for a hybrid analysis with the air-Cherenkov and radio technique combined. The main goals of Tunka-Rex are to investigate the achievable precision in the reconstruction of energy and composition of the primary cosmic rays by cross-calibrating to the well understood air-Cherenkov detector. While the focus in the first season was to understand the detector and calibrate the detector, an early analysis already proves the detection of air-shower events with dependencies on energy and arrival direction as expected from a geomagnetic emission mechanism. Furthermore, in near future tests will be conducted for a joint operation of Tunka-Rex with Tunka-HiSCORE, a prototype gamma ray observatory at the same site, and the upcoming scintillator extension of Tunka-133.

The empirical research was designed to obtain answers to two questions: whether the image of the region well recognizable and the much-discussed "Balaton-brand" could be formed? Research results indicate the different views about the region's image of the various stakeholders, the lack of effective communication between tourism operators and those professionals are not sufficiently aware of tourists' views. The touristic region of Balaton has had an important role in the tourism of Hungary and the tourism supply of the region has undergone a huge transformation in the past period. In spite of these positive changes the main characteristic of the Balaton is still the shortness of its high season which is characterized by bathing in the lake. To enhance competitiveness, apart from broadening complex services it is necessary to introduce a clear Balaton brand and image on both internal and international markets.

The stormwater in the project area was treated by innovative LID facilities such as raingarden, bioretention swales and terrace trenches, and the treated stormwater was diverted to the landscaping lakes for irrigating the entire project during the dry season. To maintain the lake water levels and water quantity for irrigation, the polluted Yangmeikeng River water is pumped into the raingarden on the southwest corner, from which treated water enters the upper west lake. The synthetic 133mm 4-hour storm event with 10 year return period was used to design the LID facilities and other pipeline conveyance. The 24 hour historical rainfall of 389mm was used to evaluate the LID facilities responses to an extreme event. The simulation results show that the LID facilities have very large flood control performance.																					978-0-7844-7902-5				2015							331	341																WOS:000381031400034

In this study, Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images and Chinese environmental mitigation satellite CCD sensor (HJ-1 CCD) images, both of which are at 30m spatial resolution were employed for identifying and monitoring of vegetation types in a area of Western China-Qinghai Lake Watershed(QHLW). A decision classification tree (DCT) algorithm using multi-characteristic including seasonal TM/HJ-1 CCD time series data combined with digital elevation models (DEMs) dataset, and a supervised maximum likelihood classification (MLC) algorithm with single-data TM image were applied vegetation classification. Accuracy of the two algorithms was assessed using field observation data. Based on produced vegetation classification maps, it was found that the DCT using multi-season data and geomorphologic parameters was superior to the MLC algorithm using single-data image, improving the overall accuracy by 11.86% at second class level and significantly reducing the "salt and pepper" noise. The DCT algorithm applied to TM/HJ-1 CCD time series data geomorphologic parameters appeared as a valuable and reliable tool for monitoring vegetation at first class level (5 vegetation classes) and second class level(8 vegetation subclasses). The DCT algorithm using multi-characteristic might provide a theoretical basis and general approach to automatic extraction of vegetation types from remote sensing imagery over plateau areas.

However, it is not known whether surface-flow constructed wetlands can effectively purify irrigation return water. To investigate the performance of a constructed wetland in terms of meeting the goals of pollutant purification, the 8th drainage of Ulansuhai Lake was used for this study. Pollutant removal performances, as well as hydrological characteristic variations in relation to specific characteristics of plants, were investigated utilizing two years of monthly average data. The results indicated that surface-flow constructed wetlands can effectively change the physical characteristics of return water and lead to a sharp decrease in pollutant concentrations. The 1200 m long, narrowly constructed wetland resulted in the average reduction rates of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) of up to 22.1% and 21.5%, respectively. The overall purification efficient of the constructed wetland presented seasonal variations in four different monitoring periods (May, July, September, and November). Constructed wetlands with multiple types of plants exhibited higher efficiencies in pollutants removal than those with a single type of plant. The current study can provide meaningful information for the treatment of agricultural wastewater.																			1687-9309	1687-9317					2015	2015								142036	10.1155/2015/142036	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2015/142036													WOS:000356707100001

Endothall treatments controlled heavy growth of curlyleaf on an annual basis in all 7 years, but long-term control, where no future treatments would be necessary, was not achieved. During the curlyleaf control program, coontail (Ceratophyllum demersum) distribution and abundance increased dramatically as curlyleaf distribution and abundance decreased. None of the other 3 native submersed plant species found in Gleason Lake increased in frequency over the 7 years of treatment. It is not clear what triggered the rapid coontail expansion or if its heavy growth will be sustained. During the same time period, Gleason Lake transparency increased while phosphorus and chlorophyll concentrations decreased. Water quality improvements in Gleason Lake were likely related to nutrient uptake by coontail growth.																			1040-2381	2151-5530					2015	31	2					109	114		10.1080/10402381.2015.1014583	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2015.1014583													WOS:000360248500003

It is one of the factors leading to increased interest in monitoring tests for their quality. Heavy metals are major water pollutants in Poland. The aim of this study was to determine seasonal variability in concentrations of cadmium, lead, zinc and copper in various reservoirs and water courses in the Wielkopolska region. Water samples were collected from lakes, large and small rivers and drainage ditches. These water bodies differ in land use in the surrounding. These were mostly rural. The study was conducted during the growing season from May to December 2012. Quantitative analysis of heavy metals was performed on the AA spectrometer Agilent 280Z. The results showed high seasonal variation in heavy metal contents in different water bodies. The concentrations of cadmium and zinc mainly depend on the date of discharge to water. Lead concentrations were caused by emissions and depended mainly on cultivation measures in fields. The highest concentration of copper was observed in the lakes, which could be due to the use of compounds that eliminate algal blooms. Under Polish law, all water bodies are classified into water quality classes I or II intended for drinking. Living conditions for cyprinids and salmonids were satisfactory in all the locations.																			1898-6188	2084-4530					2015	22	3					285	296		10.2428/ecea.2015.22(3)23	http://dx.doi.org/10.2428/ecea.2015.22(3)23													WOS:000420373500001

LC-MS results indicated that there are two main cyanobacteria toxins variants (MC-LR and MC-RR) during harmful algal blooms. The community structure of cyanobacteria showed that 81.04 % of total cyanobacteria biomass belongs to Microcystis spp. and the average biomass of Microcystis spp. was 2.335 mg.L-1. In addition, multivariate analyses by principal component and classifying analysis (PCCA) suggest that microcystins were mainly produced by Microcystis spp. and TP could promote MC production.					zhu, hua/MCX-7267-2025														2352-5401		978-94-62520-65-3				2015	2						464	467																WOS:000359815600114
J	Soylu, EN				Soylu, Elif Neyran			Flood pulse influence on phytoplankton community of the Aksu Stream, Giresun, Turkey	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												Flood pulse influence on phytoplankton communities of the Aksu Stream, Giresun, Turkey were studied between December 2008 and December 2009. The phytoplankton communities consisted of 54 species. The number of species and diversity of phytoplankton showed seasonal variation, being high in rainy season. As a consequence of the flood which occurred twice in July 2009, phytoplankton environment changed physically and chemically, which resulted in an alteration in the composition of phytoplankton community. The phytoplankton community that existed previous to the flood event, had been dominated by Hantzschia amphioxys but was replaced by Nitzschia palea and a teratological form of Fragilaria sp. Presence of teratological form of diatom in the stream indicated unfavourable conditions in this region.																			0254-8704					JAN	2015	36	1					185	190											26536791					WOS:000348489300001

But, influenced by the climate change and human activity, Poyang Lake wetland has changed a lot. The long time series of Terra/MODIS data between 2000 and 2014 were utilized to investigate the variation of Poyang Lake and to analyze Poyang lake response to variation of local precipitation with the meteorological data. The results showed: (1) Poyang Lake water body area showed a significant seasonal variation, minimum value was about 690 km(2) and maximum value reached 3500 km2, and inter-annual fluctuation; (2) For the past 15 year, local precipitation directly affected the inundation changes. In particular, the impact of rainfall during the first half of the year is more significant (the relation coefficient with R-2 of 0.61); (3) Taking into account humid activities, the impoundment of the Three Gorges dam (TGD) had a certain impact on Poyang Lake water body area, especially the persistent reduction of Poyang lake surface area in November was deteriorated by the impounding of TGD in October after 2006. Finally, the study provides a theoretical basis and data for changes in Poyang Lake wetland research and protection.

EVALUATION METHOD OF WATER QUALITY FOR RIVER BASED ON MULTI-SPECTRAL REMOTE SENSING DATA	36TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				36th International Symposium on Remote Sensing of the Environment (ISRSE)	MAY 11-15, 2015	Berlin, GERMANY					With the rapid development of the regional economy, water pollution has gradually become an environmental problem that cannot be ignored. As an important water source in central China, the Han River should strengthen water quality monitoring and management in order to ensure the sustainable development of watershed and related areas. Taking typical sections of middle and lower reaches of the Han River as the study area, this paper focuses on rapid river water quality assessment using multispectral remote sensing images. Based on measured water quality data and synchronous spatial high and medium-resolution remote sensing data ( multi-spectral data of ZY3 and HJ1A) in 2013, neural network algorithm is used to establish water quality index retrieval model for the study area, and then water quality status is assessed accordingly. The results show that BP neural network retrieval model of water quality index that is established based on multispectral data of ZY3 satellite has higher accuracy and that its assessment results are of high credibility and strong applicability, which can really reflect changes in water quality and better achieve water quality assessment for the study area. In addition, water quality assessment results show that major excessive factors in the study area are total nitrogen and total phosphorus; the polluting type is organic pollution; water quality varies greatly with seasons.

The concentrations of DOC and other water environmental factors were investigated during the wet season (August 2014) in northern Poyang Lake. In this paper, the primary objective was to illustrate the spatial distribution of DOC in northern Poyang Lake. Additionally, the relationships between DOC and water environmental factors such as chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), chlorophyll a (Chl a), total suspended matter (TSM), and turbidity were analyzed. The results showed that concentrations of DOC in northern Poyang Lake were relatively low during the wet season, with an averaged value of 1.927 mg/L ranged between 1.607 and 2.821 mg/L. Spatially, the concentrations of DOC were higher in the north and lower in the south with variation of water levels. Correlation analysis showed that DOC was positively correlated with CDOM, TSM and turbidity, but not related with Chl a. Combined with field investigation, the results indicated that DOC in northern Poyang Lake was more likely come from terrestrial sources, and it had a certain relationship with frequently sand-excavating in the northern water area connected with the Yangtze River.																			2161-024X						2015																								WOS:000381472200091

Benomyl reduced the severity of diseases caused by Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, Phaeoisariopsis griseola and Phoma exigua var. diversispora. Multiregional multiseasonal on-farm trials using benomyl, thiram and the insecticide endosulfan, reduced the severity of seed-borne diseases and beanfly and increased yields of diverse varietal bean mixtures by 25% in regions above 1400 m in elevation. Combined treatments increased bean yields 17% and 35%, respectively, in the September and March seasons. Seed treatments with endosulfan alone increased yields by 17% in multiseasonal multiregional trials, through yield increases in the March season, but not in the September season, owing to low beanfly pressure. Yield increases from endosulfan applications alone occurred in regions below an elevation of 1700 m. A presowing seed treatment of benomyl, thiram and endosulfan was effective over the broadest range of conditions. Seed treatments can reduce farmers' risk of damage from multiple diseases and beanfly, thus substantially increasing on-farm bean productivity; they are effective without promoting genetic erosion of the diverse bean varietal mixtures used by local farmers in the Great Lakes region of Africa, as can occur with genetic replacement strategies.

This shallow eutrophic lake is a part of the St. Johns River. Quantitative samples of lake water and sediments were collected on a monthly basis from 16 stations and analyzed for various physico-chemical parameters. Relatively high levels of dissolved solids (mean electrical conductivity (EC) = 1832 .mu.S cm1) prevailed in the lake water, and seasonal changes in EC were probably associated with hydrologic flushing from external sources, such as incoming water from upstream as well as precipitation. Average monthly levels of total N and P during the study period were 1.82 and 0.21 mg l-1, respectively. Nutrient concentrations in the water did not show any strong seasonal trends. Organic matter content of lake sediments ranged from 1 to 182 g C kg-1 of dry sediment, reflecting considerable spatial variability. All nutrient elements in the sediments showed highly significant (P < 0.01) correlations with sediment organic C, through little or no significant relationship appeared at any sampling period between water and sediment chemistry of the lake. Temporal trends in water and sediment chemical parameters may have been concealed by periodic hydrologic flushing of the St. Johns River into Lake Monroe.

J	HAMLEY, JM; HOWLEY, TP				HAMLEY, JM; HOWLEY, TP			FACTORS AFFECTING VARIABILITY OF TRAPNET CATCHES	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												The literature relating to sampling characteristics of trapnets were summarized and the variability of trapnet catches from Long Point Bay, Lake Erie [USA] was examined. In Long Point Bay the frequency distributions of numbers of fish caught per trapnet lift were very skewed, peaked at zero for all species. Standard deviations of raw catches of even the most commonly taken species (Ambloplites rupestris, Perca flavescens, Aplodinotus grunniens) were high, about twice as large as their means. From 50-65% of the variability of transformed catches could be attributed to differences in soak time, sampling location, season and year. Precision of estimating abundances of fish from catch-per-effort data is low for trapnets as well as for other sampling gear. The fishing effort of 9 trapnet lifts per sampling design cell sufficed to estimate, with 95% confidence, geometric mean catches in Long Point Bay to within a factor of 2 of their true values. To estimate them to within 20-25% would have required .apprx. 100 lifts. Regarding possible future changes of abundance, it would take 3 yr of observation to establish statistical significance of a decrease of arithmetic mean catches to half the levels observed in 1971-1978.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1985	42	6					1079	1087		10.1139/f85-134	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f85-134													WOS:A1985ALP7900003

A comparison of estimates of state variables indicates that Monte Carlo means are most like the measurements; Monte Carlo medians are most like the deterministic model output. Best agreement between Monte Carlo and 1st-order estimates of both state variable values and their variances occurs when Monte Carlo output distributions are symmetric. Under these conditions, both estimates are measures of variance associated with total populations (i.e., all algae). Those distributions change dramatically in time for most state variables. For asymmetric distributions, 1st-order variance estimates measure variability about the typical component of the total population (i.e., the typical algal species) and Monte Carlo variance estimates measure variability of the mean component (which is more reflective of the total).

Data available for each bird included season and district of collection, age, sex, necropsy findings, and liver concentrations of twelve elements as determined by spectrophotometry. The first three principal components (PC) accounted for 86% of the total variability of the data, which made possible a substantial reduction in dimensionality. Within PC1-PC3, calcium, iron, mercury and lead were the most influential elements in accounting for variation. The possibility of a competitive interaction between mercury and lead for selenium is suggested, with consideration given to possible alterations in bioavailability due to environmental acidification. PCA can generate hypotheses that subsequently can be investigated under conditions which allow causal inference and better control of confounding factors. Consequently, sparse field data can be used efficiently to generate information on risk factors for environmental diseases, and to provide bases for intervention strategies.

J	TWOMBLY, S				TWOMBLY, S			INTERPOPULATIONAL AND INTRAPOPULATIONAL VARIATION IN TIME TO METAMORPHOSIS IN A FRESH-WATER COPEPOD	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Adjacent populations of the copepod Cyclops scutifer Sars living in lakes in southern Norway exhibit remarkably different life cycles. A series of laboratory-common environment experiments were used to partition variance in one life cycle trait-time to metamorphosis - among and within five populations of C. scutifer, to examine the extent to which variation in this trait has a genetic basis and to test whether populations are polymorphic for development rates. The experimental populations exhibit a variety of life cycles in the field and occupy environments that represent a broad range of conditions. 2. Populations with different life cycles in the field continued to express differences in time to metamorphosis in the laboratory, indicating a genetic contribution to life cycle variation. Differences in developmental rates in the laboratory were smaller, however, than differences observed in the field, suggesting that environmental conditions also contribute to observed life cycle variation. 3. In addition to interpopulation variation, each population maintained substantial intrapopulation variation in time to metamorphosis; differences between individuals from the same population were often as large as or larger than differences between populations. 4. Individual females in most populations produced highly variable offspring, and there often was little difference in time to metamorphosis among families within a population. 5. Cyclops scutifer exhibits a hierarchy of variation in time to metamorphosis, with a major portion of this variation expressed among siblings. Intrapopulation life history variation important to natural selection may be maintained by different processes among the major groups of freshwater zooplankton.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				AUG	1993	30	1					105	118		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1993.tb00792.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1993.tb00792.x													WOS:A1993LU38100009

Juveniles enter the river in April to July and the fish return to the sea before they begin to mature. The smallest individual recorded was 103 mm, the largest 440 mm (standard length). Fat deposit index was low for the whole population and surplus energy is probably directed to growth and not stored. Condition and fat deposit index were both slightly, but significantly, lower during the dry season. Stomach contents showed that this species is a meso-predator, feeding mainly on small prawns, aquatic and terrestrial insects and small fish.

The former species was found to be a seasonal breeder which nests after the onset of the heavy rains in April. Although some birds had large gonads prior to the rains in the dry season no nesting occurred. The rains were contemporary with increases in gonadal size and the plasma titres of LH, testosterone (T) in males and estradiol (E2) in females. These hormones are associated with the initiation of breeding activity. As breeding ceased in July and the moult began, the plasma titres again decreased. There was a bimodal breeding pattern which paralleled a change in biotope preference for nesting. Early nests, in the heavy rains, were on the open savanna and later nests were in the acacia forest. Late nesting birds also had delayed peaks in gonadal size, plasma titres of LH, T and E2 and a delayed moult onset. Data on individual captive birds demonstrate that these annual cycles have a distinctly individual character superimposed on the seasonal trends. In Rueppell''s Long-tailed Glossy Starlings no seasonality in breeding was found although the flight feather moult commenced and was completed in all individuals at about the same time. The moult extended over about ten months, so a great deal of breeding-moult overlap was present. The absence of seasonality in field birds was reflected in the aviary birds, which had no pronounced cycles in the reproductive parameters measured (gonadal size, LH, T and E2 plasma titres). Breeding in field birds was regulated on a pair basis and correlated with increases in duetting. The striking differences in the seasonal organization between this species and Blue-eared Glossy Starlings were presumably due to the different biotope preferences and social behaviour of the two species.																			0019-1019	1474-919X				JAN	1987	129	1					69	85		10.1111/j.1474-919X.1987.tb03160.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1474-919X.1987.tb03160.x													WOS:A1987F842000006

Increased macrophyte growth in the water body and the present levels of urban development within the catchment are reflected in declining water quality and aesthetic deterioation. A study of the water quality of the lake was undertaken to quantify the variation of phosphorus nitrogen, and chlorophyll-a concentrations during ice-free seasons from 1992 to 1994. Its total phosphorus and chlorophyll-a concentrations indicate a meso-eutrophic status. The total phosphorus budget of Mogan Lake was measured for a period of 22 months The estimation of nutrient loading using Dillon-Rigler nutrient budget shows that an artificial load caused too high phosphorus inputs. The management implications of phosphorus loading and budget are discussed.

The method of Elliott and Persson (1978) was used to estimate daily ration. Data from sources in the literature were used to quantify gastric evacuation, which was adequately described by an exponential decay model. The exponent of gastric evacuation increased exponentially with temperature. Seasonal changes in the diet with respect to composition, distribution of food among stomachs and food particle size were reflected in the seasonal pattern of growth. Weight gain and the formation of scale annuli did not occur until the diet shifted from large bluegills and insects to age-0 largemouth bass and bluegills. Estimates of daily ration ranged from almost zero in mid-May and early June to over 5% in late Aug. The use of median weights of stomach contents yielded more meaningful estimates of the daily ration of individual bass than those based on means. Estimates based on medians were consistent with the observed pattern of growth and with information on maintenance rations and satiation levels. A growth-limiting lack of suitably-sized forage fish apparently occurred in the early part of the growing season.																			0378-1909	1573-5133					1982	7	3					265	275		10.1007/BF00002501	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00002501													WOS:A1982NW13800007
J	STEWART, AJ; WETZEL, RG				STEWART, AJ; WETZEL, RG			DISSOLVED HUMIC MATERIALS - PHOTODEGRADATION, SEDIMENT EFFECTS, AND REACTIVITY WITH PHOSPHATE AND CALCIUM-CARBONATE PRECIPITATION	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Dissolved humic materials (DHM) are often important constituents of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pool in lakes, but little is known about environmental factors that regulate DHM quality and quantity, or of the ecological importance of DHM in pelagial environments. Experiments were undertaken to determine the relative importance of sediment/pH and of photolysis in regulating the quality and quantity of DHM in a small, hardwater lake. In addition, since DHM may affect pelagial primary producers by interacting with reactive nutrients, certain relationships were examined between DHM and orthophosphate, and between DHM and the process of CaCO3 precipitation and phosphate coprecipitation. Sediment/pH conditions markedly influenced the spectral characteristics and apparent MW spectra of DHM. Field and laboratory data indicated that organic-rich sediment selectively absorbs DHM of high apparent MW leaching from scenescing littoral vegetation during rain events, and slowly releases DHM of lower apparent MW between rain events. Sunlight or high-intensity UV light was sufficient to cause rapid (< 300 min) alteration in the spectral characteristics of DHM, and solar radiation is likely important in seasonal regulation of DHM quality in shallow waters and in the upper photic zone in pelagial areas. Low concentrations (< 2 mg l-1) of fulvic material were potent inhibitors of the CaCO3 precipitation process under natural conditions, but did not significantly alter short-term (0-3 days) rates of 14C assimilation by natural algal assemblages. Binding of orthophosphate to DHM could not be demonstrated under conditions similar to those in the epilimnion of the study site, but may be an important regulator of phosphate in systems of lower alkalinity.					stewart, arthur/D-8471-2012														0003-9136						1981	92	3					265	286																WOS:A1981MN01800001

Correlation and time series analyses, including Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series by Loess (STL) methods, revealed very high correlations among all data series at daily to annual timescales. The two meteorological stations in the region are found to be generally representative of the greater area, and local temperature variability appears to be predominantly determined by synoptic-scale weather patterns. The annual temperature cycle in this region is complex and has annually repeating components at all study sites across the region. The analysis of daily data using the STL method can provide new insight into climate time series and enhance our ability to observe patterns and extremes in temperatures across varying spatial and temporal scales. Data loggers provide a cost-effective way of obtaining similar (and sometimes higher-quality) information compared to meteorological stations or gridded global datasets.					; Gajewski, Konrad/L-5128-2017	Chaput, MIchelle/0000-0002-9448-4135; 													0004-0843	1923-1245				DEC	2014	67	4					537	553		10.14430/arctic4427	http://dx.doi.org/10.14430/arctic4427													WOS:000346625500010
J	OFORIDANSON, PK				OFORIDANSON, PK			ECOLOGY OF SOME SPECIES OF CATFISH SYNODONTIS (PISCES, MOCHOCIDAE) IN THE KPONG HEADPOND IN GHANA	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Some aspects of the ecology of the freshwater catfish Synodontis (Pisces: Mochocidae) in Kpong Headpond (Ghana) were studied. Five species were encountered, namely Synodontis schall, S. gambiensis, S. ocellifer, S. velifer and S. eupterus. S. ocellifer and S. velifer were not recorded in the area before impoundment and might have entered the headpond as eggs or young from the main Volta Lake. Length: weight relationships for the two most important species can be described by the equations: Log W = - 1.76 + 3.12log L (male S. schall), Log W = - 1.33 + 2.89log L (female S. schall) and Log W = - 0.39 + 2.07log L (S. gambiensis, sexes combined). Synodontis is omnivorous and generally browses on benthic deposits. Adults feed mostly on chironomids, plant material and aquatic insects. The genus displays sexual dimorphism by having a short urino-genital papilla in most adult males. For S. schall, one season of major spawning activity occurs per year from mid to late September with first time spawners between 20.0-30.0 cm SL. The Synodontis species studied lay between 2000 to 209000 eggs per spawning season.																			0378-1909					SEP	1992	35	1					49	61		10.1007/BF00001157	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00001157													WOS:A1992JJ27500006

During a substantial period of the growth season of 1983, P-limited growth was observed in Lake Breukeleveen and Lake Loosdrecht, but P limitation was less severe in the latter. In Lake Breukeleveen the maximum initial phosphate uptake rate (Vm) varied between 0.3 and 5.7 .mu.g P (.mu.g Chl)-1 h-1 during P-limited growth, whereas in Lake Loosdrecht, Vm varied between 0.3 and 2.1 .mu.g P (.mu.g chl)-1 h-1. Both at the end of June and the beginning of July, growth was not P limited in either lake. Phytoplankton in Lake Loosdrecht was not limited by phosphorus in September. Th frequent occurrence of P limitation led to the prediction that reduction of the P loadings of Lake Loosdrecht will result in a reduction of the phytoplankton biomass.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				SEP	1986	31	5					983	988		10.4319/lo.1986.31.5.0983	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1986.31.5.0983													WOS:A1986E892400005

Studies were made on the development of Phragmites australis (Cav. Trin. ex Steudel stands. Monthly levels of N, P, K, Na, Ca and Mg in the organs (leaf-blade, leaf-sheath, culm, aquatic root, rhizome and root) of reed were determined from April to October in 1980. Differences were detected between the four study areas in the shoot height, mass, growth rate and element contents. In the aboveground organs, the levels of N, P, and K showed a decrease all through the growing season, but Ca and Mg rose to a peak before declining for the rest of the season. In the underground organs the levels of N and P decreased to a minimum in June to July and thereafter the quantities of these elements gradually increased. In the most heavily contaminated area (area IV), significantly higher levels of tissue N, P and K were found.																			0015-5551						1986	21	1					65	84		10.1007/BF02853399	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02853399													WOS:A1986A021700003

The transport of these contaminants to resident communities in spawning streams was studied in two tributaries of Lake Michigan accessible to anadromous spawners and one control tributary blocked to them. No polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), DDT, or dieldrin were detected in the sediments or biota of the control stream, or in sediments of the test streams. However, trout Salmo spp. and, to a lesser extent, sculpins Cottus spp. accumulated PCBs and DDT as a result of eating contaminated salmon eggs. Eggs constituted as much as 87% (by weight) of the total stomach contents of trout collected during the salmon spawning season early October to early January. Salmon eggs contained 0.46-9.50 mg PCBs/kg and 0.14-180 mg DDT/kg. Consumption of eggs varied greatly among individual trout, and there was a strong correlation between numbers of eggs in the stomachs and PCB and DDT concentrations in the fillets.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				JAN	1986	115	1					69	74		10.1577/1548-8659(1986)115<69:COSFWC>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1986)115<69:COSFWC>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1986A934200010

J	HEANEY, SI; TALLING, JF				HEANEY, SI; TALLING, JF			DYNAMIC ASPECTS OF DINOFLAGELLATE DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS IN A SMALL PRODUCTIVE LAKE	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Vertical and temporal distribution patterns of the dinoflagellate Ceratium hirundinella O.F. Muller, in relation to controlling factors, were studied for a small English [UK] lake (Esthwaite Water). General and grosser features of distribution were established from regular sampling at one station; examples are given from 1966-1967 and 1975-1977. Finer resolution and analysis were possible from more intensive study of selected episodes over the whole lake in 1976 and 1977. The seasonal cycle of the euphotic population comprised a phase of near-exponential increase (May-July), a stationary phase of high numbers (July-Sept.), and a very rapid decline, often accompanied by cyst-formation (late Sept.-Oct.). The motile cells avoided the anoxic hypolimnion and, at times, the strongly illuminated surface layer. Depth-maxima often formed at the boundaries of these regions. Under conditions of low wind stress during the rapid (exponential) growth phase, vertical distribution may be mainly controlled by the underwater light climate and thermocline (pycnocline). Maximum density of Ceratium occurred at 3-4 m depth, at which depth about 10% of the surface-penetrating irradiance wa measured. Surface-avoidance by cells was often found, but not appreciable vertical migration. During the stationary phase of the population cycle there was a change of behavior, and Ceratium aggregated near the surface during daytime. Conditions of light wind stress along the long axis of the lake (about 3 m s-1) may cause laminar horizontal flow of the surface layers, which induced upwelling of subsurface maxima of Ceratium at the windward end of the lake, or downwind transport of the alga when concentrated in the surface waters. Moderate to strong wind conditions (> 4 m/s) caused sufficient turbulent mixing to eliminate vertical stratification of Ceratium within the epilimnion. Photo-inhibition of cellular fluorescence by Ceratium occurred in the upper layers during the day. Cells collected below the euphotic zone quickly (< 2 min) showed large decreases in fluorescence when exposed to strong sunlight.																			0022-0477	1365-2745					1980	68	1					75	94		10.2307/2259245	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2259245													WOS:A1980JK96200006

However, this event bad relatively recent precedents, The context of high rainfall variability in the Chad Basin, and the resulting continuous changes in the level of the Lake throughout history and prehistory, are used here to illustrate the non-equilibrium condition. Such environmental change is in turn shown to engender adaptive livelihood strategies in the region, including multiple incomes (from fishing, farming, trade and other activities) and mobility, both seasonal and in relation to longer-term patterns of settlement, These local strategies are contrasted with larger governmental and multilateral projects, which have failed in the past due to a lack of appreciation of the non-equilibrium setting.

Concentrations have been reported on a wet whole (with shells), dry whole, wet soft tissue, dry soft tissue, and lipid weight basis. This study examined residues of organic contaminants in samples of zebra mussels collected from 24 sites in the lower Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River, to determine if the way in which the residues were normalized could affect the precision of estimated concentrations or the spatial trends observed. Variation in the moisture content of soft tissues was minimal, so normalizing to wet or dry soft tissue weight would yield consistent results. Moisture content of whole mussels was more variable, and relative proportions of soft tissues and shell vary with size, season and location-potentially confounding spatial trends. Lipid content also varies greatly among locations, seasons and years, and lipid-normalized residues were much more variable than residues normalized to whole or soft tissue weight. Furthermore, site-to-site trends based on lipid-normalized data did not always agree with those based on other components of the organism, and thus should not be interpreted in isolation.																			1201-3080						2002	37	2					429	444		10.2166/wqrj.2002.028	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wqrj.2002.028													WOS:000176077200009

We investigated the complete structure of the pelagic food web during a 2 1/2-year research programme on Lake Ammersee. Hydroacoustic surveys showed a seasonal pattern in the depth distribution of European whitefish that led to their temporary separation from zooplankton. The resulting differences in predation pressure had an influence on composition, seasonal and vertical distribution, and some life history parameters of zooplankton. The temporal and spatial distribution patterns also led to poor exploitation of the available food potential and seemed to be one of the reasons for the varying feeding status of European whitefish in Lake Ammersee.																			0071-1128		3-510-47059-1				2002	57						411	421																WOS:000180355400034
J	Rumbold, DG; Mihalik, MB				Rumbold, DG; Mihalik, MB			Biomonitoring environmental contaminants near a municipal solid-waste combustor: a decade later	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												During the 1999 nesting season, eggs and nestlings of anhingas (Anhinga anhinga) and white ibises (Eudocimus albus) were collected from a colony located on the site of a municipal solid-waste (MSW) combustor and analyzed for residues of chemicals potentially released from this facility. Concentrations of most residues, including tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), tetrachlorodibenzofuran (TCDF), arsenic, beryllium, cadmium and lead, were at levels comparable to those found during a similar survey done in 1989, prior to facility start-up. Nickel residues were detected only sporadically in anhingas and in eggs from ibises, and decreased significantly in concentration in ibis nestlings in 1999 compared to 1989. While concentrations of mercury in anhinga nestlings and in eggs of both species were comparable to 1989 levels, its concentration was significantly greater in ibis nestlings in 1999. However, levels of mercury in the ibises remained relatively low when compared to birds from other areas of Florida and did not appear to represent a health threat. While lead did not increase in 1999, its concentration in ibis nestlings remained a concern. The most notable temporal trend observed in birds at this site was a general monotonic decrease in levels of selenium residues during the 10-year monitoring period. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In this formulation the standard version of the POM model is modified by replacing the open boundaries with a closed coastline and adopting the bathymetry of Lake Victoria. The lake model has 9 equal vertical sigma levels and the horizontal resolution is 20 km, The model's upper boundary conditions are based on momentum, sensible heat and radiative energy fluxes derived from double-nested simulations of the NCAR regional climate model (RcgCM2) or idealized surface boundary forcing. The idealized simulations are 360-day model simulations to investigate, (i) the sensitivity of the lake's circulation on variations in the shear and direction of the idealized upper boundary wind stress forcing, (ii) the response to abrupt change in the direction of surface wind stress forcing to assess the memory of the lake, and (iii) the sensitivity of the lake's circulation on its vertical temperature stratification. The RcgCM2 model output is used for constructing the upper boundary conditions of the lake model for the October-November-December seasonal "short-rains" of eastern Africa. In these experiments we apply selective and systematic suppression of radiation, heat and momentum fluxes contributions to the upper boundary forcing to determine their relative importance. The results show that the bathymetry and geometry of the lake play a fundamental role in determining the climatology of Lake Victoria. The regions of upwelling or downwelling are determined by wind stress and nearshore bathymetry. The momentum memory of Lake Victoria is about two weeks long. There exists Kelvin wave like disturbances in the thermocline that are trapped along the coast and propagate clockwise around Lake Victoria with periodicity of about 30 days. The oscillations entirely disappear in the case of the isothermal conditions. The lake surface circulation is characterized by anti-clockwise circular motion in response to the predominantly easterly surface winds. The three-dimensional model produces a surface temperature pattern indicative of horizontal lake water mixing characterized by a horizontal spiral pattern in the temperature field. This is associated with the spreading of a pool of warm water across the northern section of the lake. This pattern is not present in the one-dimensional model. Comparison of the POM model simulation results with the one dimensional thermal diffusion lake model, used in the NCAR RegCM2 regional climate model, indicates that the former produces more realistic results. This work represents an important phase towards the development of a fully coupled regional climate simulation model for the Lake Victoria basin.																					1-4020-0772-8				2002	12						153	186																WOS:000179074600005

Conductivity measurements were evaluated as estimates of the dissolved solids content of the water. T-C relationships were found to change considerably with depth and season in salt-stratified lakes, and errors as high as 15% could occur in Mahoney Lake unless several T-C plots were used to adjust field conductivity measurements to a constant temperature. Corrected in situ measurements underestimated conductivity as determined from the chemical composition. Diluted conductivity provided a more consistent estimate of dissolved solids content by eliminating most effects of ion-ion interactions upon ion mobility.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				DEC	1986	43	12					2450	2454		10.1139/f86-304	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f86-304													WOS:A1986F150400007

J	KING, GM; KLUG, MJ				KING, GM; KLUG, MJ			GLUCOSE-METABOLISM IN SEDIMENTS OF A EUTROPHIC LAKE - TRACER ANALYSIS OF UPTAKE AND PRODUCT FORMATION	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												The uptake of glucose and the formation of end products from glucose catabolism were measured for sediments of eutrophic Wintergreen Lake with a combination of tritiated and 14C-labeled tracers. Time course analyses of the loss of [3H]glucose from sediments were used to establish rate constants for glucose uptake at natural substrate concentrations. Turnover times from these analyses were about 1 min for littoral and profundal sediments. No seasonal or site differences were noted in turnover times. Time course analyses of [U-14C]glucose uptake and 14C-labeled end product formation indicated that glucose mass flow could not calculated from end product formation since the specific activity of added [14C]glucose was significantly diluted by pools of intracellular glucose and glucose metabolites. Mass flow could only be accurately estimated by use of rates of uptake from tracer studies. Intermediate fermentation end products included acetate (71%), propionate (15%), lactate (9%) and only minor amounts of butyrates or valerates. Addition of H2 to sediments resulted in greater production of lactate (28%) and decreased formation of acetate (50%), but did not affect glucose turnover. Depth profiles of glucose uptake indicated that rates of uptake decreased with depth over the 0-18-cm interval and that glucose uptake accounted for 30-40% of methanogenesis in profundal sediments.																			0099-2240	1098-5336					1982	44	6					1308	1317		10.1128/AEM.44.6.1308-1317.1982	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.44.6.1308-1317.1982								16346148					WOS:A1982PT27700009

Toolik Lake is slightly buffered, deep and very oligotrophic. Microbial activities, as determined by 14C-acetate incorporation into extractable lipids, associated with Carex litter were significantly (P < 0.01) reduced within 2 days at pHs of 3.0 and 4.0, but not 5.0, 5.5 or 6.0, as compared with ambient controls (pH 7.4). ATP levels were significantly reduced at pH 3.0, but not at the other pHs tested. After 18 days, microbial activity significantly correlated with weight loss (P < 0.05) N content (P < 0.01), and C/N ratios (P < 0.01) of the litter, but did not correlate with ATP levels. Scanning electron microscopy of the litter surface revealed that the fungi present at ambient pH did not become dominant at pHs below 5.5, diatoms were absent below pH 4.0, and bacterial numbers and extracellular slime were greatly reduced at pH 4.0 and below. Mineralization of Carex 14C-lignin-labeled or 14C-cellulose-labeled lignocellulose was reduced at pH 2.0, but not at pH 4.0, 5.0 or 6.0, compared with controls (pH 7). If the pH of the water from this slightly buffered lake was sufficiently reduced, rates of litter decomposition would be significantly reduced.																			0099-2240	1098-5336					1982	43	5					1188	1195		10.1128/AEM.43.5.1188-1195.1982	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.43.5.1188-1195.1982								16346015					WOS:A1982NY69700033

The analysis was made (a) to the ten species with the greatest mean biomass in the data over one growth season and (b) to the ten species providing the greatest canonical correlation with the growth factors. The latter species were detected using an exchange type procedure. The analysis showed strong associations within phyla. Especially the most problematic phylum with respect to the use of the lake, the cyanobacteria, had a pronounced mutual association, as they correlated negatively with the N/P ratio as positively with phosphorus.

Research were carried out from 1885 to 1994 in the Alaotra lake region, the main rice-producing area of the country, characterized by a warm rainy season from October to April and a cool dry season from April to October. The adult beetles invade the rice nurseries and the first direct-seeded fields Lit the beginning of the rainy season; they have a gregarious behaviour and their feeding activity, together with the mines bored by the larvae, determines a change of colour from green to pale yellow in the damage areas. which resemble outbreak areas of rice leafhoppers. Oviposition takes place only on young rice plants in the tillering stage. Females emerging after the end of February enter a reproductive diapause and leave the rice fields to 'hibernate'. Temperature summations for the egg. larval, and pupal development, Lis well as for the preoviposition period have been calculated. There is no yield loss up to a larval density of 0.6 per leaf and this economic injury level is seldom exceeded in the Alaotra lake region. Life tables carried out under field conditions show that chalcid parasitoids are the main mortality factor and are responsible for the collapse of entire outbreak areas. Since the discovery of the rice yellow mottle virus in 1989 in the Alaotra lake region and the disease transmission by chrysomelids, the pest status of D. gestroi has changed and control measures have to be applied. However, to avoid interference with the action of the parasitoids. chemical applications should be limited to rice nurseries.																			0931-2048					DEC	2001	125	9-10					493	500		10.1046/j.1439-0418.2001.00584.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1439-0418.2001.00584.x													WOS:000173162100002

In accordance with earlier studies, we have found that Metallogenium morphotypes show a stable seasonal distribution in Lake Washington. We have used 54Mn(II) tracer studies coupled with poisoned and no-oxygen controls to demonstrate that biological manganese oxidation was not linked to the numbers of Metallogenium morphotypes. The data suggest that these morphotypes do not contribute significantly to the biological oxidation of manganese in Lake Washington.

Of the 6 most common crustacean zooplankton species in southern Lake Malawi, 4 exhibited seasonal changes in population size over a period of 2.5 yr. Seasonal trends were repeated between years, but both seasonal and annual patterns in zooplankton abundance were confounded by short-term fluctuations in population size. These short-term fluctuations represented demographic changes and could not be dismissed as sampling error. Patterns of zooplankton abundance varied considerably between years, and no 1 yr data accurately described the dynamics of zooplankton in this tropical lake.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1983	28	6					1214	1224		10.4319/lo.1983.28.6.1214	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1983.28.6.1214													WOS:A1983RV40400013

Information on the nutrient kinetics of A. formosa Hass. and C. meneghiniana Kutz. under either phosphate or silicate limitation was obtained for use in a Monod model and in a variable internal stores model of growth. Short-term batch culture growth experiments were fit to the Monod model and long-term semicontinuous culture experiments and short-term uptake experiments were fit to the variable internal stores model. Mathematical analysis indicated that the parameters of the 2 models may be expressed in terms of each other at steady state. The qualitative results of both batch and steady state culture methods agreed. For limiting phosphate experiments, A. formosa was better able to grow at low PO4-P concentrations than C. meneghiniana, as shown by its lower K [kinetic constant] for PO4-P limited growth. The kQ [kinetic constant for steady state growth] of A. formosa compared to C. meneghiniana found in long-term semicontinuous culture indicated that A. formosa was almost an order of magnitude more efficient at using internal phosphate for growth. The qualitative results under silicate-limiting conditions also agreed between the 2 methods. For short-term batch culture, K for silicate-limited growth of C. meneghiniana was less than that of A. formosa. The kQ from semicontinuous culture experiments indicates that C. meneghiniana was the more efficient when using internal silicate for growth. Nutrient uptake experiments showed more variability from a Michaelis-Menten relationship than short-term growth experiments. There were no significant differences between the 2 spp. in half saturation constants for either phosphate or silicate uptake. A marked dependence of the coefficient of luxury consumption (R) of phosphate on the steady state growth rate was observed. A. formosa had a higher R than C. meneghiniana.

J	Hamilton, DP; Hocking, GC; Patterson, JC				Hamilton, DP; Hocking, GC; Patterson, JC			Criteria for selection of spatial dimension in the application of one- and two-dimensional water quality models	MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTERS IN SIMULATION					11th Biennial Conference on Modelling and Simulation	NOV, 1995	NEWCASTLE, AUSTRALIA	MSSA, IMACS				A critical aspect of modelling water quality in lakes and reservoirs is to select a model with a spatial representation that is appropriate for the dominant mixing processes and the observed variation in water quality variables. One-dimensional modelling is frequently applied to small-to-medium size lakes and reservoirs to encompass variations that are most pronounced in the vertical as a result of seasonal or permanent density stratification. Two- and three-dimensional models are generally applied to larger water bodies where both horizontal and vertical variations are important. Horizontal variations may result from the local effects of inflows and outflows, basin scale seiching and wind mixing. Increased dimensional capabilities in water quality models produce a large increase in computational time and may therefore impose severe constraints on the length of the simulation. This problem is most frequently averted by increasing the time step, which in itself may introduce problems associated with numerical diffusion. Therefore when longer simulations of water quality in a lake are required, as is often the case for management applications, it is desirable to select a model with the least spatial dimension required to adequately encompass the observed variation in water quality variables and the most important mixing processes. This study proposes a set of criteria that can be used a priori to select the appropriate dimensional representation when applying a water quality model to a lake. The critical factors that influence the application of a one- or two-dimensional model are the size of the lake, the volume of the inflows and the settling velocity of particulates in the inflows.

J	WESTCOTT, MP; MIKKELSEN, DS				WESTCOTT, MP; MIKKELSEN, DS			COMPARISON OF ORGANIC AND INORGANIC NITROGEN-SOURCES FOR RICE	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Rice (Oryza sativa L.) responds well to green manure-N under flooded conditions, but more quantitative data are needed for comparisons to inorganic N. This study compared the effects of vetch (Vicia benghalensis L.) and (NH4)2SO4 on patterns of N availability and plant uptake, applied-N recovery at harvest, and grain yield in flooded rice culture. The sources were incorporated in a Clear Lake clay (Typic Pelloxerert) in factorial combination of 60 kg N/ha increments up to a maximum rate of 180 kg N/ha. Grain yields were determined in plots of 18.9 m2 while N balance was assayed in microplots (0.27 m2) treated with 15N-labeled materials. Ammonium sulfate was more effective in raising extractable-N concentrations early in the growing season and made a greater contribution to plant N status throughout the season. There was no evidence that vetch extended the period of N availability to plants. Grain yields were highly dependent on N uptake; they maximized at 10.1 Mg/ha with 120 kg N/ha as (NH4)2SO4 but responded linearly to vetch up to 8.4 Mg/ha with the highest of addition. Ammonium sulfate effected greater labeled-N recovery (19% across rates) and apparent N recovery (55.6%) by plants than vetch (10.1 and 27.9%, respectively). More vetch-N was recovered in the soil at harvest; total recoveries were, therefore, not significantly different between N sources. The rate of green manure-N mineralization early in the growing season appears to be the limiting factor in comparison to inorganic N.																			0002-1962	1435-0645				SEP-OCT	1987	79	5					937	943		10.2134/agronj1987.00021962007900050037x	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj1987.00021962007900050037x													WOS:A1987K218200037
J	Gómez-García, AM; Bernal, GR; Osorio, AF; Botero, V				Gomez-Garcia, A. M.; Bernal, G. R.; Osorio, A. F.; Botero, V.			Morphodynamics of a mesotidal rocky beach: Palmeras beach, Gorgona Island National Natural Park, Colombia	JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES												The response of a rocky beach to different possible combinations of hydrodynamic conditions (tides, waves, oceanic currents) has been little studied. In this work, the morphodynamic response to different hydrodynamic forcing is evaluated from sedimentological and geomorphological analysis in seasonal and medium term (19 years) scale in Palmeras beach, located in the southwest of Gorgona Island National Natural Park (NNP), a mesotidal rocky island on the Colombian Pacific continental shelf. Palmeras is an important nesting area of two types of marine turtles, with no anthropogenic stress. In the last years, coastal erosion has reduced the beach width, restricting the safe areas for nesting and conservation of these species. Until now, the sinks, sources, reservoirs, rates, and paths of sediments were unknown, as well as their hydrodynamic forcing. The beach seasonal variability, from October 2010 to August 2012, was analyzed based on biweekly or monthly measurements of five beach profiles distributed every 200 m along the 1.2 km of beach length. The main paths for sediment transport were defined from the modeling of wave currents with the SMC model (Coastal Modeling System), as well as the oceanic currents, simulated for the dry and wet seasons of 2011 using the ELCOM model (Estuary and Lake COmputer Model). Extreme morphologic variations over a time span of 19 years were analyzed with the Hsu and Evans beach static equilibrium parabolic model, from one wave diffraction point which dominates the general beach plan shape. The beach lost 672 m(3)/m during the measuring period, and erosional processes were intensified during the wet season. The beach trends responded directly to a wave mean energy flux change, resulting in an increase of up to 14 m in the width northward and loss of sediments in the beach southward. This study showed that to obtain the integral morphodynamic behavior of a rocky beach it is necessary to combine information of hydrodynamic, sedimentology and geomorphology in different time scales.

These streams exhibited spatial and temporal gradients in water pH ranging from a high of 7.0 to a low of 4.5. Twelve sites along these streams were used for comparative analyses of the effects of pH and related water chemistry parameters on the planktonic, sedimentary, and epilithic bacterial communities. The planktonic bacterial communities were not influenced by water pH or related water chemistry parameters. For sedimentary populations, the organic content of the sediment was more important than the chemistry of the overlying water. The epilithic bacterial communities, however, were influenced significantly by the pH of the water column, showing decreased bacterial production at lower pH.																			0095-3628						1990	20	3					211	230		10.1007/BF02543878	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02543878								24193975					WOS:A1990EQ56700001

Natural phytoplankton communities from oligotrophic-eutrophic Lake Memphremagog [USA, Canada] were grown at P-limited rates of 0.06-0.93/day in continuous, lake water cultures. APA varied inversely with P-limited growth rate and was little influenced by the community composition changes that occurred in culture. Compared to cultures, average in situ APA in Lake Memphremagog during the ice-free season was low and suggested P-limited growth rates > 0.6/day in even the most oligotrophic parts of the lake. Although algal abundance varies with total P among most north-temperature zone lakes, including Lake Memphremagog, data show that average community growth rates are normally high and change relatively little over a 4-fold range of total P concentration.

Chlorophyll a ranged 22-445 mg m-2. Gross primary productivity attained 0.28 +/- 0.14 g C m-2 h-1 (range: 0.06-0.60), its yearly value being approximately 900 g C m-2, but the shallow euphotic depths and the high plankton respiration ensured that net productivity was generally low. Respiration losses amounted to 0.31 +/- 0.24 g O2 m-2 h-1, with phytoplankton respiration roughly attaining one-half of overall plankton respiration. Areal phytoplankton productivity and plankton respiration followed a seasonal trend but this was not the case for photosynthetic capacity. Surface photoinhibition was evenly distributed throughout the study. Quantum yields showed an increasing depth trend, but no seasonal trend. Both P(max) and I(k) were both temperature- and irradiance-dependent. As compared with lakes of lesser trophic degree, phytoplankton primary production in hypertrophic lakes might be increased not only by higher nutrient contents but also by low chlorophyll-specific attenuation coefficients and low background, non-algal attenuation, thereby allowing for higher areal chlorophyll contents and hence higher areal productivity. Our study suggests that physical (irradiance and water column stability) as well as chemical features (dissolved inorganic carbon and soluble reactive phosphorus) may control seasonality of phytoplankton primary production in this lake despite recent claims that only physical factors are of significance in hypertrophic lakes. However, this does not explain all the variability observed and so a food web control is also likely to be operating.																			0142-7873					JUL	1992	14	7					979	996		10.1093/plankt/14.7.979	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/14.7.979													WOS:A1992JD90700007

Much of the breeding effort of males was synchronized and there were 3 peaks of abundance during the 100 day period of major breeding. In June, a male''s cycle lasted 13-14 days, during which an average male collected 1000 eggs from about 10 females. Superior reproductive success of males was associated with nesting early in the season, in vegetated littoral areas of the lake, in deep water, and in sheltered habitats. A male''s level of aggression, body color, boldness toward predators, nest concealment behavior and egg stealing behavior changed during his reproductive cycle. The changes in body color and behavior seemed related to a decreasing emphasis on stealing eggs from a rival''s nest and an increasing emphasis on parental care. Most nest offspring were cannibalized within 2 days after fertilization. Neighboring males in all stages of breeding used solitary sneaking behavior to steal eggs from a rival''s nest and most eggs were stolen by parental males. Raider packs, composed of hundreds of non-breeding male and female adults, also raided nests causing a total loss of the nest and its contents. Raiding of nests by breeding males seemed related to a shortage of food resources. Females often courted males prior to spawning. The incidence of this behavior seemed related to an excess of females.																			0005-7959	1568-539X					1978	67		3-4				178	207		10.1163/156853978X00323	http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/156853978X00323													WOS:A1978GF13900003

Mating pairs and females with spermatophores were found in September and October in all three years, when water temperature decreased from 20.0 degrees to 12.5 degreesC. Females spawn the following year, and there are six months between mating and spawning. The lengths of each mating pair were similar for both male and female. Mean carapace length in males was 21.7 mm (range: 18.6-24.9), and in females it was 20.9 mm (18.4-22.9). The male lies ventral side up below the female. The male does not use his chelae to hold the female, but rolls his tail over the abdomen of the female. Cambaroides japonicas is placed in the family Cambaridae.

The responses of these 3 species to elevated water tables were studied on 4 contours bordering an expanding lake in southeast Oregon [USA] during the 1983 and 1984 growing seasons. When plants were initially selected for study, contours wer 0, 10, 20, and 40 cm above the lake surface. Continued expansion of the lake flooded the lower contours and elevated the water tables under the upper contours. Wyoming big sagebrush rapidly succumbed to surface flooding and elevated water tables within 10 cm of the surface. Green rabbitbrush behaved similarly, but responses lagged about 1 week behind sagebrush. Black greasewood tolerated surface flooding for 40 days before effects were apparent. Water tables within 25 to 30 cm of the surface had no effect on greasewood. Given adequate topography and water supplies, water spreading techniques could be used to control Wyoming big sagebrush and green rabbitbrush.																			0022-409X					JUL	1986	39	4					334	337		10.2307/3899774	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3899774													WOS:A1986D235800012

The distinguishing characteristics between the previously confused S. galiaeus and Tilapia zillii. The distinguishing characteristics between the previously confused S. niloticus and S. aureus are summarized; from these there is no evidence of hybridization of the 2 spp. in natural populations in Egypt. The scales are used to estimate the growth rates of tilapia species in 2 coastal lakes and in both, S. niloticus grows faster than S. aureus after the 1st yr. The possible factors causing the growth checks on the scales are considered. The spawning season of S. niloticus appears to attain a discrete peak in April-May, while the spawning season of S. aureus extends from May-Sept. with at least 2 actual spawnings within this period. Natural spawning cycles are compared with those observed in fish ponds. A more extended spawning period of S. aureus may explain the reduced growth rate of the species after the 1st yr. The spawning cycle of all species coincides with the temperature regime of the water bodies. The fecunditis of S. aureus and S. niloticus are similar and are described by log F = log 1.33 + 2.23 log L, which suggests that small fish produce more eggs per gram of body weight than large fish. The salinity tolerance of the Nile tilapia can be ranked as T. zillii > S. galilaeus > S. aureus > S. niloticus. Evidence on chronic and acute and effects of salinity are reviewed. Upper estimates for salinities giving unimpeded growth are T. zillii 29.permill. S. galilaeus 15-20.permill.. S. areus 10-15.permill. and S. niloticus 5-10.permill.																			0044-8486	1873-5622					1983	30	1-4					335	351		10.1016/0044-8486(83)90174-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0044-8486(83)90174-6													WOS:A1983PU34100029
J	Deaconu, LF				Deaconu (Stanescu), Luminita-Florentina			Characterization of Heavy Metals Distribution at the Level of Biotic Compartments of the Dambovnic River	REVISTA DE CHIMIE												Dambovnic River, a tributary of the Neajlov River, has undergone over time al different loads of heavy metals (Cr, Cd, Pb, Mn) from industrial wastewater discharges from nearby settlements. Another source of pollution is the significant quantities of heavy metals that are carried downstream when stronger spills cause resuspension of bottom sediments of upstream lakes. It is known that the highest concentrations of heavy metals in river are found in the bottom sediments. (See also previous article), but the fate of these metals and the impact on the ecosystem are still unknown. The main purpose of this paper is to clarify as much as possible, the impact of heavy metals such as Cr, Cd, Mn have both on submerged and anchored vegetation and on benthic macroinvertebrates in the Dambovnic catchment. According to the analyzed results submerged/floating species (Cladophora and Lemna minor) presents a Cd bioconcentration factor greater than one, much larger than the anchored species (where F-bc<1), suggesting the potential they have in terms of phytoremediation techniques of aquatic systems which capture industrial effluents with high concentrations of metals. The transfer of chromium from the lower to the upper parts of the Typha, Juncus and Potamogeton is less (Typha sp 0.06- 0.25; Juncus sp. 0.05-0.09), indicating that, in the event of Cr contamination of aquatic sites, risk transfer of this to primary consumers is reduced. For benthic macroinvertebrates Cr concentration factors are below par, showing that the metal does not focus on the benthic macroinvertebrates, the main compartment that stores this metal is the sediment. For Mn, the dynamics spatial of averages, seasonal of tissue concentrations of benthic macroinvertebrates is characterized by highest values at station D4, for all taxonomic groups which were analyzed.																			0034-7752					SEP	2014	65	9					1096	1102																WOS:000343965900021
J	ZHAO, Y; KING, CE				ZHAO, Y; KING, CE			ECOLOGICAL GENETICS OF THE ROTIFER BRACHIONUS-PLICATILIS IN SODA LAKE, NEVADA, USA	HYDROBIOLOGIA												In an earlier study we found that the rotifer Brachionus plicatilis in Soda Lake, Nevada (USA) maintains extensive genetic variation for three isozymes. This variation was present both within and between different collections. No evidence was found that there was a seasonal succession of distinct electromorphs. In this paper we ask: is the genetic variation maintained by selective neutrality among electromorphs? Parthenogenetic females from ten clones representing seven different composite electromorphs were selected for life table analysis. Substantial main effects of genotype or interactions of genotype with experimental food quantities and temperatures, were found for the intrinsic rates of increase, net reproductive rates, and mean life spans of these clones. We conclude that these fitness differences permit us to reject the hypothesis that genetic variation is maintained because of selective neutrality among clones. Instead, it seems likely that directional selectional may be either too weak or of too brief a duration in Soda Lake for clonal exclusion to occur.

Silica-scaled species were encountered in samples from all seasons of the year and in water with pH measurements ranging from 5.7-8.7. Based upon qualitative electron microscopic observations, 34 taxa were identified in 27 collections. Temperature, pH and specific conductance were measured for each collection. Of the commonly observed taxa in this survey, Chrysosphaerella brevispina was relatively stenothermic, occurring in six collections with a temperature range of 2-11 C. Synura echinulata was observed only in the five most acidic collections, pH 5.7-6.6. Mallomonas tonsurata, M. pseudocoronata, M. acaroides and M. caudata were common in relatively alkaline collections and may form an assemblage of silica-scaled species common in alkaline prairie habitats. Future research directions suggested by these data are discussed.																			0003-0031	1938-4238				JAN	1989	121	1					32	40		10.2307/2425654	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2425654													WOS:A1989T909700004
J	FRANCE, R				FRANCE, R			EPIPHYTIC ZOOBENTHOS DENSITY AND BIOMASS WITHIN LOW ALKALINITY, OLIGOTROPHIC LAKES ON THE CANADIAN SHIELD	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The phytofaunal macroinvertebrate communities within the shallow littoral zones of 19 Ontario Shield lakes were examined during the ice-free seasons of 1984 and 1985. Neither total zoobenthos density nor biomass were linearly correlated with lake pH, alkalinity, total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen, or chlorophyll-a concentrations. Specifically, however, the standing crops of several taxa were significantly related to these and other limnological variables without discernable trends with regard to the summed totals. For example, lakes of high alkalinity (> 3.5 mg CaCO31-1) had a large percentages of their total biomass composed of gastropods and turberllarians in contrast to lakes of low alkalinity (<1.0 mgl-1) which were dominated by odonates and water mites. Secchi depth was the best trophic predictor of total density (r = -0.67) and total biomass (r= -0.63). The possibility some dependence of littoral zoobenthos on allochthonous energy sources, and the potential for buffering with macrophyte beds, are both unknown, which, together with the marrow range of chemical variables in these lakes (e.g. pH from 5.5 to 6.7 and TP from 5 to 14 mg m-3), may explain the absence of strong chemical correlates of zoobenthos standing crop in this study. There was hyperbolic relationship between phytofaunal biomass and lake mean depth. The best single predictor of total biomass for the subset of 8 intensively sampled lakes was maximum depth (r= -0.92). The most productive direction towards predicting littoral zoobenthos standing crop may be the development of models relating macroinvertebrates to macrophytes and basin morphometry.																			0003-9136					JUN	1990	118	4					477	499																WOS:A1990DN92500007

Concurrent measurements were made of water temperature. DOC, phytoplankton production of dissolved (EDOC) and particulate organic carbon, chlorophyll .alpha. and the uptake of glucose (Vmax). The objective was to determine the dominant factors correlated to the number of metabolically active bacteria and the relationship between active bacterial numbers and heterotrophic activity. The number of active bacteria was usually highest at the surface and ranged between 0.70 and 6.82 .times. 106 cells ml-1. The dominant factors correlated to the number of bacteria at the surface were water temperature (r = 0.65, n = 54, p < 0.001), primary production (r = 0.53, n = 51, p < 0.001) and EDOC (r = 0.37, n = 45, p = 0.005). Surface Vmax for glucose ranged between 0.11 and 4.0 .mu.gC l-1 h-1 and was positively correlated to the number of active bacteria (r = 0.61, n = 53, p < 0.001). The specific activity index (10-12 .mu.gC cell-1 h-1) varied between 80 and 2290 at the surface and was most strongly correlated to EDOC (r = 0.70, n = 48, p < 0.001). Relationships between active bacterial numbers, water temperature, phytoplankton activity and glucose uptake were also found at two additional depths within the epilimnion. These data suggest that bacterial populations in nutrient enriched lakes contain a large number of metabolically active cells with high individual activity as a result of enhanced phytoplankton growth.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR 15	1988	160	2					179	188		10.1007/BF00015481	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00015481													WOS:A1988M567700010
J	WINFREY, MR; ZEIKUS, JG				WINFREY, MR; ZEIKUS, JG			ANAEROBIC METABOLISM OF IMMEDIATE METHANE PRECURSORS IN LAKE MENDOTA	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Lake Mendota [Wisconsin, USA] sediments and the immediate overlying water column were studied for a better understanding of the metabolism of the methanogenic precursors H2/CO2 and acetate [by methanogenic bacteria] in nature. The pool size of acetate (3.5 .mu.M) was very small and the acetate turnover time (0.22 h) was very rapid. The dissolved inorganic C pool was large (6.4-8.3 mM) and the turnover time was slow (111 h). CO2 accounted for 41 .+-. 5.5% of the methane produced in sediment. Acetate and H2/CO2 were simultaneously converted to CH4. The addition of H2 to sediments resulted in an increased specific activity of CH4 from H14CO3- and a decrease in specific activity of CH4 from [2-14C]acetate. Acetate addition resulted in a decrease in specific activity of CH4 from H14CO3-. The metabolism of H14CO3- or [2-14C]acetate to 14CH4 was not inhibited by addition of acetate or H2. After greater than 99% of added [2-14C]acetate had been turned over, 42% of the label was recovered as 14CH4, 20% was recovered as 14CO2 and 38% was incorporated into sediment. Inhibitor studies of [2-14C]acetate metabolism in sediments demonstrated that CHCl3 completely inhibited CH4 formation but not CO2 production. Air and nitrate addition inhibited CH4 formation and stimulated CO2 production, whereas fluoroacetate addition totally inhibited acetate metabolism. The oxidation of [2-14C]acetate to 14CO2 decreased with time when sediment was incubated before the addition of label, suggesting depletion of low levels of an endogenous sediment electron acceptor. Acetate metabolism varied seasonally and was related to the concentration of sulfate in the lake and interstitial water. Methanogenesis occurred in the sediment and in the water immediately overlying the sediment during periods of lake stratification and several centimeters below the sediment-water interface during lake turnovers. Methanogenesis in Lake Mendota sediments was apparently limited by immediate methane precursor availability (i.e., acetate and H2), by competition for these substrates by non-methanogens and by seasonal variations which altered sediment and water chemistry.																			0099-2240	1098-5336					1979	37	2					244	253		10.1128/AEM.37.2.244-253.1979	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.37.2.244-253.1979								434807					WOS:A1979GJ97100012

White perch (Mororle americana) began appearing in gill-net samples in 1988. By 1993 they were the second-most abundant species (11.2/net night), following black crappie (Pomoxis nigromaculatus (21.2/net night). White perch catch rates in 1994 (16.1/net night) exceeded rates for other fish captured in gill nets. White perch continued to constitute a large percentage (21.1%) of the gill-net catch from 1995-1998. Analysis of variance of log-transformed white perch catch data detected significant year effects (P=0.0001). No significant season or sub-basin effects were detected. Neither interaction between sub-basin and year nor interaction between sub-basin and season was significant. The 3-way interaction between year. sub-basin. and season was not significant. Interaction between season and year was significant (P=0.0001). Concurrent with increasing white perch abundance during the 12-year study were decreases in abundance of white crappie (Pomoxis annularis), bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), and flat bullheads (Ameiurus platycephalus). However, this period also corresponded to early succession of the reservoir which was impounded in 1981.																									1999							162	169																WOS:000169733700019
J	HOWARDWILLIAMS, C; ALLANSON, BR				HOWARDWILLIAMS, C; ALLANSON, BR			PHOSPHORUS CYCLING IN A DENSE POTAMOGETON-PECTINATUS L BED	OECOLOGIA												An analysis of P concentrations and standing stocks in the various components of a dense P. pectinatus L. community in a brackish lake showed that the amounts of P per unit area varied in the following order: sediments > aboveground macrophytes > detritus > benthic invertebrates > belowground macrophyte tissue > epiphytic algae > water soluble P > water born particulate P. Seasonal changes in the variability of these stocks are described, and shown to be controlled by the annual growth and decomposition pattern of the Potamogeton. The sediments were suggested as the major source of P for the plant biomass. Studies using 32P tracer showed that of a given input of P to the water, 32% went to large epiphytic algae, 17% to the Potamogeton, 16% to the benthic fauna (mostly filter feeding bivalves), 28% to the sediments (almost all incorporated in the top 1 cm), and the remaining 7% was adsorbed on to, or absorbed by microorganisms associated with detritus. Analysis of 32P uptake curves indicated that of the P absorbed by the Potamogeton, a significant proportion went to the complex adnate periphtyon on the leaf surface. We were unable to separate this fraction. Movement of P in the community was a closed cycle, and any release of P from decaying macrophytes would be rapidly reabsorbed by epiphytic algae. It is unlikely that P, once cycling in the macrophyte community, would become transferred to the circulation in the open lake.

Alternating elastic sediments and evaporites of different chemical composition have long been recognized as sensitive records of changes in inflow and aridity related to a variety of climate parameters. Several sources of paleotemperature information from a halite-bearing saline lake deposit are described here - pseudomorphs of a cold-temperature evaporite mineral, homogenization temperatures of fluid inclusions in halite, and stable-isotope compositions of fluid inclusions in halite. Examples of these paleoclimate data come from analysis of the lower half of a 185-m core drilled in Pleistocene saline lake deposits at Death Valley, California. Daily and seasonal temperature variations in saline lake waters create conditions for the appearance and disappearance of temperature-dependent mineral phases. In the Death Valley core, hexagonal-shaped halite crystals, probable pseudomorphs of the cold-temperature hydrous mineral, hydrohalite (NaC1 . 2H(2)O), provide evidence of brine temperatures below about 0 degrees C. Homogenization temperatures of fluid inclusions in primary halite offer an actual (not proxy) record of surface-brine temperatures. Samples with primary fluid-inclusion textures are carefully selected and handled, and data are collected from single-phase aqueous-brine inclusions chilled to nucleate vapor bubbles. Temperature variations are observable at scales of individual halite crystals (hours to days), single halite beds (weeks to months or years), and multiples of beds to entire facies (hundreds to tens of thousands of years). A delta(18)O/delta D stable isotope record from the minute quantities of brines in fluid inclusions in halite is accessible using a method recently developed at the University of Calgary. The stable isotope record from the Death Valley core, a complex response to climate variables including temperature, humidity, storm patterns or seasons, and inflow sources, compliments and expands the interpretation emerging from the stratigraphy and homogenization temperatures.																			0921-2728					JAN	1997	17	1					101	130		10.1023/A:1007977414600	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1007977414600													WOS:A1997WK96500009

The importance of herbivores in controlling nanoplankton was determined by in situ grazing measurements during 1985. Data from a ten year period show that Lake Geneva encompasses almost as much variability in the taxonomic composition of the phytoplankton as does the entire range of lakes studied by the Plankton Ecology Group. In spite of the lake''s greater year-to-year variability, successional events in Lake Geneva are, in general, well described by the PEG-model, especially for the diatom-cryptophyte-chlorophyte-dinoflagellate sequence in the phytoplankton.																			0003-9136					DEC	1988	114	2					161	174																WOS:A1988R622900001
J	WAGNERDOBLER, I				WAGNERDOBLER, I			VERTICAL MIGRATION OF CHAOBORUS-FLAVICANS (DIPTERA, CHAOBORIDAE) - THE CONTROL OF DAY AND NIGHT DEPTH BY ENVIRONMENTAL PARAMETERS	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												In three small, adjacent, meso- to eutrophic lakes the vertical migration of the 4th-instear-larvae of the Dipteran Chaoborus flavicans has been investigated by means of echogram analysis. Two phases of the diurnal migration cycle, i.e. depth during the day and during the night, were compared among the three lakes and throughout one year. Day depth showed marked differences between the three lakes and during the seasons, which may be the result of a behavioral pattern consisting of three traits; 1) avoidance of high concentrations of H2S or other toxic chemicals, 2) avoidance of oxygen and 3) preference for light intensities below 3-5 Lux. By contrast, night depth exhibited no marked seasonal pattern and no significant differences between the three lakes. The seasonal fluctuations of oxygen concentration, temperature or turbidity of the lake water had no effect on night depth. Light intensities at Chaoborus depth at night covered about three orders of magnitude. Only in one lake a weak correlation between light on the lake surface and Chaoborus depth was detected. It is concluded that a preference for a certain range of hydrostatic pressure (around a dpeth of 3.5 m) largely determined night depth, modified by avoidance of extreme light intensities.

The 3 lakes differed in size, morphometry, productivity and acid neutralizing capacity and no lake had anoxia in the water column. Redox potentials (Eh) were higher for oligotrophic South and mesotrophic Deer than eutrophic Oneida within the sediment. In the water column, the only S constituent measured was sulfate which was higher in nutrient rich Oneida (110-490 .mu.mol/l) than South (30-70 .mu.mol/l) or Deer (10-60 .mu.mol/l). Total S in sediment was higher for South than for Deer or Oneida. For Deer and South sediment, total S was greatest in the 5-15 cm layer, and this was likely due to historical changes in anthropogenic inputs through atmospheric deposition. The high S concentration in South sediment was accounted for by particulate deposition of S through the water column. Organic S constituents constituted major forms of S in the sediments of the 3 lakes. Non-HI reducible S, of which C-bonded S was a dominant constituent, comprised a major portion of total S in Oneida, South and Deer. Ester sulfate was the next largest S constituent in South and Deer. As a percent of total S, sulfide (HCL digestion) and sulfate was higher in Oneida than South or Deer. There was an inverse relationship between sediment Eh and sulfide. Pyritic S was measured on bulk samples and constituted 37, 12 and 6% of total S in Oneida, South and Deer. Inorganic and organic S forms showed seasonal variation and the transformation and translocation of these forms played an important role in the S dynamics of lakes.																			0049-6979	1573-2932					1984	21	1-4					231	245		10.1007/BF00163627	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00163627													WOS:A1984SA81700022

Sampling was carried out on three separate seasons - cold dry season, hot dry season and rainy season - such that, at least one complete hydrological cycle in the dam was covered. Results show that mercury constitutes a significant problem in the dam. Concentration in the water column is higher than the maximum acceptable level (10 ng/L) as established by national environment criteria and is present at considerable levels in the bottom sediments (up to 500 mu g/kg). In the water, mercury presents a seasonal variation, where the highest concentrations are found during the dry period and the lowest concentrations at the end of the rainy season due to dilution of the metal in water. Sediment concentration of mercury shows evidence of self-cleaning mechanisms in the dam in which, principally through processes of sedimentation, part of the metal is removed from the water column, improving the outflow water quality.

J	Cheong, D; Jung, HM				Cheong, Daekyo; Jung, Hee Man			Change of sedimentary facies of the Soyang Lake sediments and its effects on the environmental sedimentology since the construction of the Soyang River Dam	JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF KOREA												The Soyang River Dam was constructed in October, 1973, and thereafter the river was converted into a lake environment which sedimentary facies and heavy metal contents within the sediments have been largely evolved. Sedimentological and environmental sedimentological study has been carried out to reveal the change of pollution level from the beginning when the lake was formed to the present in the way of analysing textures, sedimentary facies, and heavy metals for the bottom sediments of the Lake Soyang, Gangwon-do, Korea. To get bottom sediments from the lake, a gravity corer and a rotary corer were used at twenty-four sites and at three sites of lower, middle, and upper stream, respectively. Sedimentological analyses were taken for all sediment samples, and furthermore four gravity cores were selected for geochemical analysis of heavy metals. The geochemical analysis was carried out at certain intervals of sediment cores to evaluate the change of pollution level and to point out possible sources and controlling factors of heavy metal pollution. The sediments before construction of the dam are composed of alluvial soils (Ms) of rice fields, and sand (Sg) and gravel beds (Gr) of streams. After construction of the dam, in the first stage, angular coarse rock fragments came into the lake along its slope during a shallow-water level, showing high sedimentation ratio, a gravel bed (Gm), in which many plant debris are also included, mixed with mud bed, was formed. Fine-sand (Sm) or massive-mud beds (Mm) were deposited in the time of flood seasons in the first stage of the lake. The water content and organic content have increased steeply in the upper part of lake sediments after the lake was formed. Average grain size of the uppermost part is approximately 10 mu W, and coarsens downward. The average sedimentation rate is about 1.3 cm/yr, but the sedimentation rate of the upper part is even higher than that of the lower part. The contents of heavy metals in the bottom sediments, although not being a meaningful level, show the tendency of consistent increase after the lake formed, especially such of heavy metals as As, Cd, and Pb, which are more rich in the surface sediments. As a whole, the level of heavy metals in the middle part of the Soyang Lake is higher than that in the upper part. According to analysis of correlation among heavy metal elements, local pollution sources should be present, whereas, for the whole bottom sediments of Soyang Lake, there are no serious sources effecting a pollution level of the Soyang Lake. The level of heavy metals in the sediments is strongly dependent on the water content and the grain sizes of sediment and the rainfall events within the drainage basin. Sedimentary process and sedimentation rate probably play important roles controlling the level of heavy metals in the sediments.																			0435-4036	2288-7377					2006	42	2					199	234																WOS:000410355600003

Myxidium rhodei Leger, 1905 (Myxozoa: Myxosporea) infection in roach from four lakes of northern Poland	BULLETIN OF THE EUROPEAN ASSOCIATION OF FISH PATHOLOGISTS												A study of Myxidium rhodei in roach collected in four lakes with differing water quality was conducted. The highest prevalence (13.9%) of Myxidium rhodei was observed in a weakly eutrophied lake with a large phytolittoral area which could be considered as a good niche for potentially alternate hosts for Myxosporea. The lowest prevalence (4.4%) occurred in a polluted lake with a very poor phytolittoral. There were no significant differences in seasonal prevalence of infection. The occurrence and appearence of histological alterations and reactions in kidneys of infected roach from the four lakes were similar.

J	Nedoma, J; Nedbalová, L				Nedoma, Jiri; Nedbalova, Linda			Chlorophyll content of Plesne Lake phytoplankton cells studied with image analysis	BIOLOGIA												Using image analysis, chlorophyll autofluorescence was measured in single cells of green alga Monoraphidium dybowskii and in filaments of cyanobacteria (Pseudanabaena sp. and Limnothrix sp.) in the vertical profile of small acidified mountain lake Plesne jezero (Plesne Lake) from May to November of 2003. Cell chlorophyll autofluorescence was converted to cell chlorophyll content using a conversion factor determined by comparing the total autofluorescence of phytoplankton in a microscope field with spectrophotometrically determined total chlorophyll concentration; the conversion factor did not differ between epilimnion (0.5 m depth) and hypolimnion (9 m depth). Vertical patterns of chlorophyll concentration and of cellular chlorophyll content depended on water column mixing: during the period of stable thermal stratification, a metalimnetic peak in total chlorophyll concentration was present and cellular chlorophyll contents in the metalimnion and hypolimnion were notably elevated compared to the surface. Monotonous vertical profiles of both total chlorophyll concentration and cell chlorophyll content were typical for the period of water column overturn. During the stratification period, hypolimnetic Monoraphidium cell chlorophyll content was on average twice as high (maximum difference 2.7-fold) compared to surface values (of 3.2-12.9 fg mu m(-3)), while in filamentous cyanobacteria (surface cell chlorophyll content of 2.2-13.3 fg mu m(-3)), the difference was much higher - six-fold on average, with an 11.6-fold maximum value. The values measured with image analysis in 2003 were compared to unpublished values of total phytoplankton biomass-specific chlorophyll concentrations obtained using manual phytoplankton biomass determination and spectrophotometric chlorophyll measurement in 1998 at the same locality. Good agreement was found in seasonal patterns and vertical profiles of chlorophyll between both seasons.

During the year 1983, seasonal fluctuations ranging from 25 to 44% were observed in the parasitological index as well as concommitant variations from 5 to 18% in the splenic index. More malaria transmission seems to occur during the long dry season (June to September. In order to prepare an operational research project to be conducted in two geographically delimited areas of the Health Zone, a complementary survey was organised in February 1985. This survey yielded details on parasitological, splenic and serological index in relation to age. These paludometric index were similar in the two areas and all gradually increased with age to reach maxima of respectively 42%, 13% and 55%. The Katana region, situated at an altitude of 1500 meters, on the shores of lake Kivu, is apparently characterized by an unstable and mesoendemic malaria. The applicability and feasability of some alternative malaria control strategies are discussed.																			0365-6527					DEC	1990	70	4					263	268											2291691					WOS:A1990ER88100002
J	ALDABBAGH, KY; BLOCK, W				ALDABBAGH, KY; BLOCK, W			POPULATION ECOLOGY OF A TERRESTRIAL ISOPOD IN 2 BRECKLAND GRASS HEATHS	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												Two superficially similar chalk grasslands in the Breckland of East Anglia [UK] provided very different habitats for the abundant terrestrial isopod Armadillidium vulgare (Latreille). At Lakenheath Warren the site was a tussocky grassland, ungrazed, with Festuca spp. covering 65-80% of the area, and most of the isopod population was found in the litter layer (5 cm deep) of the large tussocks throughout the year. At Weeting Heath National Nature Reserve, smaller Festuca tussocks comprised 25-30% of the site, and the isopods moved between the tussocks and the intervening grazed sward. Mean annual population density of A. vulgare on the grazed site at Weeting was 1.4-1.6 times larger than that of the ungrazed site at Lakenheath, which increased to a maximum of 2.8 times at other periods. Differences in population structure between the 2 sites were detected in terms of age structure, generation distribution and cohort composition. At Weeting each cohort bred once; at Lakenheath each cohort participated in 2 annual breeding seasons. There was a high mortality of newborn young at both sites, and survivorship curves were similar being type 3 (Deevey 1947). Large variations occurred in the number of young produced per year at Weeting; annual recruitment was similar at Lakenheath. An alternation of high and low density generations occurred as a result at Weeting. Changes in the structure of the 2 populations of A. vulgare are discussed in relation to habitat structure, grazing effects and environmental heterogeneity.																			0021-8790	1365-2656					1981	50	1					61	77		10.2307/4031	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/4031													WOS:A1981LC92700005

A clear spatial pattern was observed between the tributaries and the reservoir, with the highest values of conductivity, alkalinity, pH, silicate and phosphate (SRP) in the tributaries. The incorporation of bicarbonate, silicate, SRP and other nutrients by littoral vegetation and the decomposition process of macrophytes could explain the spatial pattern and the temporal variation of the nutrients. The freshwater marsh situated between the tributaries and reservoir acts as sink for silicate and SRP. The temporal and spatial pattern of total phosphorus (TP) was correlated with suspended matter values. The low nitrogen concentration and the ratio of the inorganic nitrogen to SRP suggest that nitrogen is a limiting factor for primary production. Some seasonal vertical gradients of SRP, TP, and silicate were observed, with the highest concentrations at the surface or at 0.5 m of depth; these could be due to water exchange between littoral and pelagial zones. According to principal component analysis, three main features characterize the spatial. and temporal patterns: a) water mineralization changes, b) the supply of suspended matter and nutrients from the tributaries and littoral zone, and c) the seasonal variations of temperature and oxygen.

J	HALL, PM; JOHNSON, DR				HALL, PM; JOHNSON, DR			NESTING BIOLOGY OF CROCODYLUS-NOVAEGUINEAE IN LAKE MURRAY DISTRICT, PAPUA-NEW-GUINEA	HERPETOLOGICA												The nesting of Crocodylus novaeguineae in Lake Murray District, Papua New Guinea is described, based on observations of 121 nests during 1980-1981. Cryptic nest location and wariness of adults inhibited nest discovery. Most nests (68.7%) were built on land, the remainder on floating mats of herbaceous vegetation. The breeding season was protracted, but 95% of nesting occurred in the November-May wet season. Sexual maturity, as evidenced by copulation in captivity, was attained at 1.4 m in females and 1.5 m in males. Oviposition by a captive individual occurred 68 days after mating. Estimated incubation period was 83-91 days. Mean clutch size (21.8 .+-. 6.9 SD, n = 44) did not differ between nests on land and floating mats, although mean egg mass (103.5 g .+-. 5.6 SD, n = 426) differed between nest types. Clutch size was highly correlated wth female size (r2 = 0.77) and clutch mass (r2 = 0.83). Overall nest (86.7%) and hatching (85.4%) success differed significantly between nests on land and floating mats. Observer handling had no effect on nest success. The probability of an egg hatching in this population was 74.0%. Combined losses of nests to flooding and predation (varanids, feral pigs, humans) were 13.3%. The proportions of nest reuse and site reuse were 10.7% and 43.8%, respectively, with the majority of nesting females (74.4%) smaller than the size protected by law.																			0018-0831	1938-5099				JUN	1987	43	2					249	258																WOS:A1987H408800012
J	SCHEDA, SM; COWELL, BC				SCHEDA, SM; COWELL, BC			ROTIFER GRAZERS AND PHYTOPLANKTON - SEASONAL EXPERIMENTS ON NATURAL COMMUNITIES	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Four seasonal, in situ, grazing experiments were conducted in Lake Brooker, Florida (U.S.A.). Rotifer concentrations (0 .times. = control, 1 .times., 2 .times., 4 .times. and 8 .times. ambient density) were allowed to feed on natural phytoplankton assemblages suspended in the lake within polyethylene bags for 24 or 48 h; each concentration was replicated five times. After incubation, rotifers and phytoplankton were separated, preserved and counted. Phytoplankton from treatments 1 .times. to 8 .times. were compared with the 0 .times. control. Rotifer grazers produced distinct shifts in the taxonomic compositions and size distributions of the phytoplankton assemblages. Total and chlorophycean nannoplankton decreased significantly at one or more rotifer densities in all experiments. Cyanophycean nannoplankton decreased significantly only during the warmer months when they were more abundant. Reductions in large or small cryptophycean nannoplankton corresponded directly to the sizes of the predominant rotifer species. The largest decreases in phytoplankton volumes were generally in the 4 .times. rotifer treatments. But in experiments with high numbers of grazing rotifers significant decreases in phytoplankton volumes were observed in the 1 .times. treatment which approximated ambient lake density.																			0003-9136					NOV	1988	114	1					31	44																WOS:A1988R412900003
J	Beracko, P; Rogánska, A				Beracko, Pavel; Roganska, Alexandra			Intra- and interspecific variations in life strategies of Erpobdella octoculata and Erpobdella vilnensis in different habitats along the longitudinal gradient of stream	LIMNOLOGICA												Our study examines intra and interspecific variations in life histories, reproduction parameters, secondary production and feeding biology of two erpobdellid leech species (Erpobdella octoculata and Erpobdella vilnensis) across longitudinal gradient of streams. These species frequently cohabit in streams of Central Europe and present a very high niche overlap in terms of spatial distribution and trophic resources. In both species, a shift from biennial to annual life cycle was noted, as well as from iteroparity to semelparity. In general, annual erpobdellid populations invested more in reproduction than the biennial populations and E. octoculata invested more in reproduction than any E. vilnensis. The absolute individual growths of studied species were described by the von Bertalanffy growth model with seasonal oscillations. The highest values of daily growths (6.1-8.6% of dry mass per day) were noted during the first month after hatching. Annual production ranged for E. vilnensis from 3.48 to 10.01 g formalin mass m(-2) year(-1) and for E. octoculata from 11.29 to 19.29 g formalin mass m(-2) year(-1). The prey diversity and overlap of prey composition and potential prey resources of leeches indicate that, compared to older leeches, the younger leeches are more selective feeders.

J	EZAKI, Y				EZAKI, Y			IMPORTANCE OF COMMUNAL FORAGING GROUNDS OUTSIDE THE REED MARSH FOR BREEDING GREAT REED WARBLERS	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH												Foraging habitat selection of breeding great reed warblers was studied at a shore of Lake Biwa. The foraging grounds of parent warblers during the nesting period were not restricted to the breeding territory of the reed marsh, their nestling habitat. The paddy field outside the reed marsh was used communally by them throughout the breeding season. Females with early stage nestlings did not visit the paddy field whereas when nestlings were older than 3 days, more than half of their total food was collected there. Females with nests adjacent to the paddy field tended to exploit the paddy field more often than those with nests distant from it. Monogamously mated females tended to exploit the paddy field more often than polygynously mated females. Food collected in the paddy field was larger than that in the reed marsh and parent birds were prepared to travel longer distances to exploit the rich source of food in the paddy field. The importance of the communal foraging ground outside the reed marsh as it background of the polygynous mating system of this species is discussed.																			0912-3814					APR	1992	7	1					63	70		10.1007/BF02348598	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02348598													WOS:A1992HR42100008

For the period of incubation, hatching and feeding of small young (end of May-June) the analyses did not reveal any clear patterns, but indicated that presence of G. stellata was related to large lake surface area and presence of Acerina cernua, and G. arctica to high water transparency. During July (feeding of medium-sized to large young), G. stellata primarily occurred in lakes with high density of cyprinid fish or Acerina cernua, and located close to breeding lakes. The distribution of G. arctica foraging alone or in pairs was related to high shoreline development, whereas the occurrence of birds fishing in groups to high density of Perca fluviatilis. G. stellata is presumed to be more susceptible than G. arctica to the ecological changes in freshwater ecosystems affected by air-borne acidifying pollutants.																			0006-3657					JUL	1991	38		2				135	144		10.1080/00063659109477081	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00063659109477081													WOS:A1991FU97000011

SEASONAL CYCLE AND HOST RESPONSE	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												We report the first case of a dinoflagellate infection of stickleback (Gasterosteidae), discovered on an endemic population of Gasterosteus that inhabits an acidic bog lake on the Queen Charlotte Islands, western Canada. A major difference between these and other dinoflagellate infections is that the autotrophic vegetative cyst rather than the parasitic trophont is the predominant stage on the fish. During peak infection in July, 99% of the fish were infected, and cysts often covered the entire fish including the eyes. Density of cysts was highest on the dorsal surface of the fish (to 68/mm); this is possibly associated with the photosynthetic ability of the cysts. There were no consistent differences in the infection among sizes classes of fish or between the sexes. Salmonids (Oncorhynchus kisutch and Salvenlinis malma), which are uncommon in the lake, also harboured cysts, but at very low densities. Host response to the initial infection included extensive epithelial hyperplasia, producing a layer of cells over the entire fish that enclosed the dinoflagellates. Subsequent infections were covered by additional layers of epithelium, resulting in a thick gelatinous coating. Even in cases of extreme infection, the fish exhibited no obvious behavioral indicators of pathological responses to the infection.																			0008-4301	1480-3283				APR	1990	68	4					667	671		10.1139/z90-097	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z90-097													WOS:A1990DF40400006
J	Arnott, JM; Chamberlain, J				Arnott, Justin M.; Chamberlain, Jon			Lake-Effect Freezing Drizzle: A Case-Study Analysis	JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL METEOROLOGY												A series of lake-effect freezing drizzle events occurred southeast of Lake Michigan during the 2009-2010 cool season. These events occurred under an anomalous flow pattern, were not anticipated by forecasters, and in more than one case, led to the issuance of advisories for slick travel conditions and ice accrual. Given the potential impacts of such events on the public and aviation communities-as well as limited previous research on lake-effect freezing precipitation-two case studies are performed. Despite their rarity, a common synoptic and mesoscale evolution is found in these freezing drizzle cases. Whereas the thermodynamic environment initially is supportive for lake-effect snow, a lowering capping inversion and a loss of moisture above this level diminishes the potential production of cloud ice. While this typically results in the end of lake-effect precipitation, these cases transitioned to freezing drizzle and are hypothesized to have resulted from a lack of cloud condensation nuclei in the air mass arriving from the lakes. Mesoscale model soundings projected the evolution of the thermodynamic environment. A conceptual summary of these events is presented that, given suggestive model guidance, includes tools to help forecasters better anticipate future similar events.																			2325-6184					JUN 17	2014	2	15					180	190		10.15191/nwajom.2014.0215	http://dx.doi.org/10.15191/nwajom.2014.0215													WOS:000215983100001
J	Haberman, J				Haberman, J			Contemporary state of the zooplankton in Lake Peipsi	HYDROBIOLOGIA												L. Peipsi is one of the richest fish lakes in Europe. Planktivorous smelt dominates in the fish fauna. The abundance of zooplankton fluctuates between 43 600-2 241 500 ind m(-3), with the average 974 000 ind m(-3) biomass ranges from 0,09-3,69 g m(-3), with the average 1,86 g m(-3). Since the 1960s the abundance of rotifers has risen considerably while the mean zooplankter weight (B/N) has decreased from 0.005 mg to 0.004 mg. Zooplankton production (herbivores 20.6, predators 1.8, whole zooplankton community 22.4 g C m(-2) per period between May and October) can be considered high. Predatory zooplankton eats on an average 50% of the production of herbivorous zooplankton; about 50% of the whole zooplankton production (P-Filt+Pred) reaches fishes. The production of herbivorous zooplankton constitutes 10.1% of primary production. This ratio indicates a direct relationship between zoo- and phytoplankton in the food chain; the detrital food chain seems of little importance. About 6% of phytoplankton energy reaches fishes. The transformation of energy in the food web is efficient. On the basis of zooplankton L. Peipsi can be considered a moderately eutrophic or meso-eutrophic lake.																			0018-8158					NOV 8	1996	338	1-3					113	123		10.1007/BF00031715	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00031715													WOS:A1996WC58000011
J	ASHLEY, KI				ASHLEY, KI			HYPOLIMNETIC AERATION OF A NATURALLY EUTROPHIC LAKE - PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL EFFECTS	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												The effect of hypolimnetic aeration on key components (circulation, decomposition, major nutrients, major ions, and pH interactions) of a lake ecosystem was examined in a small, naturally eutrophic lake. The lake was divided in half with a plastic curtain, and a hypolimnetic aerator was installed and operated in the experimental half for a year. Hypolimnetic aeration had no effect on thermal stratification during the ice-free season but circulated the entire experimental half under ice cover. Aeration increased hypolimnetic turbidity via reduced detrital sedimentation but did not affect epilimnetic transparency. Hypolimnetic O2 concentrations were increased as was O2 consumption since both sediment and water column oxidation of organic material was enhanced. Hypolimnetic NH4+ concentrations were reduced and sufficient O2 was added for nitrification to occur. Internal P loading and hypolimnetic PO43- concentrations were reduced but aerobic P regeneration increased. Aeration vented accumulated CO2 from the hypolimnion and decreased its Ca, Mg, HCO3- and PO43- content via calcium carbonate phosphate coprecipitation. Management applications of hypolimnetic aeration include reduction of internal nutrient loading for eutrophication control, improvement of water quality for domestic use, and prevention of fish winterkill.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1983	40	9					1343	1359		10.1139/f83-157	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f83-157													WOS:A1983RG53300002

LIMNOLOGICAL CYCLE AND THE FISH COMMUNITY DYNAMICS	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The fish fauna of Gebel Aulia reservoir (White Nile) consists of 52 species with Alestes baremoze Joannis and Brycinus nurse Ruppell dominating in numbers and biomass. The seasonality and condition of A. baremoze, A. dentex (L.) and B. nurse are described in relation to various limnological factors in the reservoir, close to the dam. The zooplankton assemblage is small-sized, consists mainly of small Cladocera and shows striking seasonality. The hydrological regime, temperature and the grazing effect of fish are the major factors influencing its development. The three species belong to a eurytopic but basically riverine fish guild. They show a seasonal cycle of abundance with high numbers at periods of water storage (October-April) and low numbers during riverine conditions. This seasonal pattern of occurrence, the size structure of the population and the maturity indices give strong evidence that no resident population is present at the study site, but upstream migrations of the immature fish occur at low water level (May-September). Return migrations of juvenile fish into the area at the dam proper take place from October until April.																			0018-8158					JAN 31	1993	250	3					173	185		10.1007/BF00008588	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008588													WOS:A1993KP36300004
J	PIP, E				PIP, E			DIFFERENTIAL ATTRITION OF MOLLUSCAN SHELLS IN FRESH-WATER SEDIMENTS	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												Mean seasonal species composition of living molluscan communities was compared with the composition of current dead assemblages in the sediments of three sites located in the Delta Marsh of southern Lake Manitoba [Canada]. Dead shells were more numerous in vegetated than in bare areas, resulting primarily from the affinities of living molluscs for vegetated areas. Redistribution patterns of empty shells were not significantly different for vegetated and bare areas, as judged from distributions of passively transported land shells in the sediments. Significant differences were observed at all sites between species frequencies in living and corresponding dead assemblages averaged for the season. Proportions of living to dead individuals per unit bottom area indicated higher attrition rates with increasing energy conditions as well as with increasing shell size. Differential attrition may result in overrepresentation of small species in fossil assemblages.																			0008-4077	1480-3313				JAN	1988	25	1					68	73		10.1139/e88-007	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/e88-007													WOS:A1988M308300007

Relative abundance of algal species in Tjeukemeer during the study period were compared with that in 1955-1960.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP	1982	95	1					223	234		10.1007/BF00044486	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00044486													WOS:A1982PP41900016
J	CHANIN, P				CHANIN, P			THE DIET OF THE OTTER AND ITS RELATIONS WITH THE FERAL MINK IN 2 AREAS OF SOUTHWEST ENGLAND	ACTA THERIOLOGICA												Otter spraints from an eutrophic lake and an oligotrophic stream were analyzed and compared with a study of the mink''s diet. Differences between the otter''s diets in the 2 areas are explained in terms of availability and seasonal variation and can be linked with changes in fish activity and behavior. The mink eats a smaller proportion of fish than the otter, but there is considerable food species overlap and the mink takes most species of fish eaten by the otter. On the lake, some differences in fish and bird predation can be detected and these may be connected with differences in the hunting behavior of the predators. Food is abundant in this area and competition for it unlikely. On the river, the pattern of predation of fish by the 2 spp. (Lutra lutra, Mustela vison) is almost identical, the biomass of fish is low and waterside birds absent, conditions which could lead to competition.																			0001-7051	2190-3743					1981	26	1-7					83	95		10.4098/AT.arch.81-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.4098/AT.arch.81-5													WOS:A1981LR27200005
J	RIEMAN, BE; FALTER, CM				RIEMAN, BE; FALTER, CM			EFFECTS OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF MYSIS-RELICTA ON THE MACROZOOPLANKTON OF A LARGE LAKE	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The effects of the introduction of opossum shrimp M. relicta on the macrozooplankton of Pend Oreille Lake, Idaho [USA], were examined from recent and historic zooplankton data. Establishment of M. relicta was associated with a temporal displacement in the seasonal occurrence of Daphnia and Bosmina species and a change in the species composition of Daphnia present. The amount of interaction between cladocerans and mysids appeared to be related to the vertical distribution of each. The cladocerans appeared and increased in abundance as the mysids became seasonally isolated from near-surface strata by increasing thermal stratification and transparency. A common negative response of cladocerans to mysid introduction is supported by the literature. Such introductions may result in the reduction of food available for kokanee Oncorhynchus nerka and other plankton-feeding fish.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					1981	110	5					613	620		10.1577/1548-8659(1981)110<613:EOTEOM>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1981)110<613:EOTEOM>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1981MK11000006

Life history and secondary production of Hexagenia bilineata (Say) in an embayment of Kentucky Lake	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY												Spatial distribution, life history, and secondary production of Hexagenia bilineata (Say) were studied in Ledbetter Embayment of Kentucky Lake, Kentucky, USA. We sampled the naiad population using a PONAR grab based on (1) geographically-referenced random sampling for the whole embayment, and (2) targeted sampling in a known high-density area. Secondary production was calculated with the size-frequency method. Greatest densities of naiads were collected in the shallow area (water depth <2m) of the embayment with sediments containing gravel and sand. Mean density and biomass in the high-density transect (70.8 m(-2), 587.3 mg ash-free dry mass, AFDM/m(2)) were more than 4x higher than estimates for the whole embayment (16.6 m(-2), 121.5mg AFDM/m(2)). H. bilineata population in Ledbetter Embayment had a mixed voltinism composed of two major cohorts, 14 and 22 month long with the majority of adult emergence occurring June through August. Annual production of H. bilineata was 333mg AFDM/m(2) for the embayment and 1736mg AFDM/m(2) for the high-density transect. The production of H. bilineata in Ledbetter Embayment was lower than previous estimates from similar reservoirs and lakes in the North America. The unusual spatial distribution pattern and low productivity of H. bilineata in Ledbetter Embayment were attributed to seasonal and spatial variations in water temperature and dissolved oxygen that affected naiad growth and development. H. bilineata population has been relegated from a species often responsible for a large percentage of the benthic macroinvertebrate production and carbon turnover to peripheral importance in total benthic energy flow in Ledbetter Embayment.																			1434-2944	1522-2632				JUN	2014	99	3					244	254		10.1002/iroh.201201616	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.201201616													WOS:000337684700005

J	Lockwood, RN; Rakoczy, GP				Lockwood, RN; Rakoczy, GP			Comparison of interval and aerial count methods for estimating fisher boating effort	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Interval and aerial angler creel Survey counting methods were compared for a statistical district of Lake Michigan (MM-6) to evaluate potential underestimation of the interval method. Two 0.5-h boat (i.e., interval) counts were made per sample day at five access ports within MM-6, and on the same day, boats in 3 out of 18 MM-6 grids were Counted from aircraft. Seasonal and monthly day-type (weekday or weekend day) estimates of boating effort by count method were compared. Seasonal boating effort estimates during open-water periods were not significantly different for aerial versus interval counts: 250,387 versus 247,117 in 2000 and 177,532 versus 2 19,097 in 2001. Similarly, comparisons of boating effort by monthly day type (i.e., weekday or weekend day) within each year did not indicate significant differences. Aerial precision estimates (2 SEs/estimate; 14.84% in 2000 and 15.53% in 2001) were more precise than interval estimates (21.42% in 2000 and 24.54% in 200 1). Similarly, predicted power (1-beta) was greater (or aerial estimates than for interval estimates. The potential power of future interval estimates to detect a 25% change in boating effort with alpha = 0.05 was 0.38 for 2000 data and 0.30 for 2001 data. Aerial estimates provided power estimates of 0.66 for 2000 data and 0.62 for 2001 data. At least four interval Counts per sample day are needed to match the precision and power of three aerial counts. Although both count types were made on the same sample days and at approximately the same (random) times each sample day, each method relied on unique estimation methods. Comparable, independent estimates establish the reliability of these two methods.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				NOV	2005	25	4					1331	1340		10.1577/M04-176.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M04-176.1													WOS:000234015800015
J	BECKETT, DC; AARTILA, TP; MILLER, AC				BECKETT, DC; AARTILA, TP; MILLER, AC			SEASONAL CHANGE IN PLANT-DWELLING CHIRONOMIDAE AND NAIDIDAE IN A WISCONSIN LAKE	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												We investigated the degree of change in the larval chironomid and naidid communities colonizing the macrophyte Potamogeton nodosus over the plant's growing season. Sampling of plant-dwelling invertebrates at three sites in Eau Galle Lake, Wisconsin near the beginning of the growing season of P. nodosus (June - 1987) and at the peak of this macrophyte's development (August - 1986 and 1987) revealed dramatic seasonal changes in abundance among the chironomid and naidid species. Non-burrowing chironomid larvae (Paratanytarsus sp., Thienemanniella nr. fusca, and Corynoneura taris) dominated the June collections, whereas burrowing chironomids such as Polypedilum illinoense, Glyptotendipes dreisbachi, and Endochironomus nigricans dominated the August collections in both years. Naidids also showed a marked change from June to August; e.g. Nais pardalis, the most abundant naidid on P. nodosus in June, was not present in the August collections. The striking similarities between the August 1986 and August 1987 invertebrate collections (and their dissimilarities from the June collections) also indicate that these seasonal changes are predictable. It is also apparent that the seasonal succession of chironomid and naidid species produces great temporal diversity, since different species use the same plants at different times. Chironomid and naidid species richness on P. nodosus was considerably greater than has been reported from other studies of plant-dwelling invertebrate communities.																			0270-5060					MAR	1992	7	1					45	57		10.1080/02705060.1992.9664669	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1992.9664669													WOS:A1992HK69500006
J	BOUCHARD, A; HAEMMERLI, J				BOUCHARD, A; HAEMMERLI, J			TREND DETECTION IN WATER-QUALITY TIME-SERIES OF LRTAP-QUEBEC NETWORK LAKES	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												After 5 yr of monitoring the LRTAP-Quebec network lakes, time series having 25 to 30 values each for 5 water quality parameters or combinations of parameters, for 12 temporal lakes, were investigated in terms of trend detection capability. Their persistence and seasonality were determined, then the appropriate trend detection test was applied. Lakes of regions 2 and 3 in the eastern part of the network show patterns that indicate acidification from 1982 to 1985 followed by a slight recovery from 1985 to 1988 with a return to higher lakewater sulphate concentrations in 1988. In region 1 (eastern part of the network), there is evidence of acidification from 1982 to 1985 followed by a leveling off of sulphate and alkalinity values from 1985 to 1988. Lakes situated in regions 4 and 5 (western part of the network) show signs of recovery from acidification. For the series with neither persistence nor periodicity (as were most of the alkalinity series), trends were detected close to the original assumptions (i.e. one standard deviation) using the Kendall test. Series with seasonality only (such as most of the nitrate series) allow trend detection below one standard deviation, using the Seasonal Kendall test. Series with persistence only (sulphates for example), tested with the Spearman/Lettenmaier test, or both persistence and seasonality (some of the nitrate series), tested with the Hirsch and Slack test, allow trend detection above 1.5 and 2.5 standard deviations respectively. Work on a calibrated watershed weekly time series shows that even if the sampling frequency is doubled, the information content increases by 10 to 25% only. The trend to standard deviation ratio decreases much the same way. Thus, the network design seems to be appropriate for detecting trends with a trend to standard deviation ratio of 1 after 7 to 10 yr of operation with a confidence level (1-alpha) and a power of the test (1-beta) of 90%, respectively.																			0049-6979	1573-2932				MAR	1992	62	1-2					89	110		10.1007/BF00478455	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00478455													WOS:A1992HE15900007

However, this assumption is difficult to test because the extent of variation within a single system is generally much smaller and the relationship accordingly less defined than across a number of systems. We present a new method to extract empirical relationships from the internal structure of a time-series within a single lake. When we applied the method to an extreme simulation, we were able to recover accurately the parameters of the relationship in spite of the absence of any apparent relationship between the variables. When applied to empirical data for phosphorus and chlorophyll concentrations collected daily over one field season, the estimated structural relationship was nearly identical to that estimated from cross-sectional data even though the empirical trend appeared much shallower and very weak.

A larger number of significant differences were detected between thermally stratified and isothermal stations than between inshore and offshore, or among seasons. Phytoplankton from isothermal waters was characterized by lower assimilation numbers and biovolume, showed symptoms of adaptation to a lower light regime, and was less phosphorus deficient than populations from thermally stratified waters. The lower growth rates and the outcome of stepwise multiple regression analyses suggest that phytoplankton growth during isothermal mixing is limited primarily by light.

J	BROCK, MA				BROCK, MA			BIOLOGY OF THE SALINITY TOLERANT GENUS RUPPIA L IN SALINE LAKES IN SOUTH-AUSTRALIA .2. POPULATION ECOLOGY AND REPRODUCTIVE-BIOLOGY	AQUATIC BOTANY												A study of the genus Ruppia in south Australia was performed. Two of the species of Ruppia found in south Australia, R. polycarpa Mason and R. tuberosa Davis and Tomlinson, are found primarily in temporary salt lakes and exhibit annual life cycles. A 3rd species, R. megacarpa Mason is perennial and is found only in permanent waters. The differences in the life cycles and reproductive biology of these species were considered. The standing crop of the annual species was always considerably less than that of the perennial; in Little Dip Lake R. megacarpa communities had 410 g m-2 DW [dry weight] of total plant matter (282 g m-2 DW of R. megarcarpa) in Nov. 1977 whereas the annual population of the R. tuberosa community had a standing crop of 11.7 g m-2 DW (3.3 g m-2 DW of R. tuberosa). Although these values varied with season and the salinity, depth and permanence of habitats, the difference between annuals and perennials held. Standing crop and time of seasonal maximum and minimum values showed further differences between annual and perennial life cycles; in Little Dip Lake, ranges were 103 (Sept.)-383 (Nov.) g m-2 DW for R. megacarpa and 1.6 (June)-99.0 (Sept.) g m-2 DW for R. tuberosa. R. polycarpa ranged from 4.2 (June) to 60.0 (Sept.) g m-2 DW in a comparable habitat, Blue-Green Algal Pool. Partitioning of Ruppia into plant parts reveals differences between annual and perennial forms as well as seasonal differences within each life cycle. In the perennial, reproductive parts (flower sand seeds) always comprise only a small part of the total dry weight, whereas in the 2 annual species the proportion of reproductive parts (flowers, seeds and turions) is higher in all seasons. Even when vegetative growth of annuals is at its maximum, the percentage of dry weight accounted for by reproductive parts is higher than at any stage in the life cycle of the perennial. Both seeds and asexual turions play a major role in propagating the annual species. The perennial spreads mainly by rhizomes. Turions are produced by R. polycarpa and R. tuberosa in Australia. Two structural types of turions were present on R. tuberosa and only 1 of these on R. polycarpa. The anatomy and role of these organs in propagation are considered.																			0304-3770	1879-1522					1982	13	3					249	268		10.1016/0304-3770(82)90063-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(82)90063-8													WOS:A1982NY04900002

Plants (preferentially indigenous) were transplanted to plastic pots in the acid-treated (A) basin and the control (B) basin. During the first phase of the experiment in 1991-1992, shortly after start of acidification treatment, the following trends were apparent: 1) The isoetid plants (Isoetes lacustris, Littorella uniflora, and Lobelia dortmanna) showed similar growth and vitality responses in the two Skjervatjern basins. 2) The elodeid species showed a slightly different response in the two basins. Juncus bulbosus exhibited a slightly higher growth rate in the acidified A basin. Myrlophyllum alterniflorum died out after less than a growing season in the treated basin A, while a few shoots survived in basin B. 3) The transplanted shoots of submerged Sphagnum auriculaiurn showed throughout both growing seasons a distinctly higher growth rate in the B basin as compared with the acidified A basin. The submerged moss species Sphagnum auriculatum showed a decreased growth in the acidified basin less than a year after start of treatment. This contrasts the results of other lake acidification studies where submerged Sphagnum mats were found to increase. The decreased growth of Sphagnum auriculatum after treatment seems most probably to be due to the increased SO4 concentrations, or to increased competition with epiphytic green algae.																			0160-4120						1994	20	3					329	342		10.1016/0160-4120(94)90117-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0160-4120(94)90117-1													WOS:A1994NM12900009

Because estimates of seasonal means are often based on only a few samples collected against this variable background, these estimates can be biased or uncertain. Our goal was to reduce the seasonal uncertainty and thereby produce more accurate estimates of chlorophyll concentration by defining a correction for phenological development. Time-series data from 149 lake-years were used to develop equations from which chlorophyll values could be ''corrected'' to the seasonal mean in relation to their particular date of measurement. However, we found the seasonal correction to be ineffectual in reducing uncertainty about nutrient-response regressions. After reviewing a number of hypotheses, we conclude that the correction derived from the average response for many lakes will be inadequate to adjust for the seasonal pattern occurring within any particular lake. This occurs because the temporal weighting correction, generated through repeated averaging, underestimates the seasonal variability which exists among individual lakes. An effective correction, if it is developed will have to be based on patterns within single lakes or possibly different lakes within a single region.

The oscar (Astronotus ocellatus) was accidentally introduced in the 1950s and became established in south Florida waterways. A gradual range expansion occurred; however, oscar populations remained low until the mid-1980s. For approximately 25 years, catches were infrequent and singular. Following an unexplained and accelerated population expansion, angler catches became more frequent and multiple. Recent peak season angler surveys in the Everglades have documented a substantial oscar fishery in terms of harvest and effort. The total number of oscar harvested in WCA-2A peaked at 11,583 in 1986-87, but dropped to 0 by the last year of the survey in that area (1989-90) for reasons which are unclear. During 3 consecutive surveys (1990-93) in WCA-3A, oscar was the number one species harvested. An estimated 99,590 oscar were harvested, which represented 63% of the total harvest. The mean total harvest rate from the 3 surveys was 2.73 per man-hour, compared to 2.36 per man-hour for all panfish, including black crappie (Pomoxis nigromaculatus), combined. Oscar ranked a close second behind largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) as the most sought after species. Many anglers who typically fished for black crappie on Lake Okeechobee relocated to the Everglades to fish specifically for oscar. Oscar sampled from the creels had a mean length of 252 mm and a mean weight of 410 g. Fifty percent of the oscar anglers interviewed used artificial lures, while other anglers used either crickets, minnows, shrimp, worms, or cut-bait. The largest documented oscar caught in the Everglades weighed 790 g.																									1994							474	481																WOS:A1994BJ69M00057

The trap was cleared daily from Nov. 1976 to March 1977 to provide data for a migration periodicity model. The number of elvers caught each season (Aug.-July) varied from 6754 to 190,009, the largest migrations coinciding with the greatest seasonal rainfall and the smallest migrations with the least rainfall. A. australis dominated all samples: 99.4% of all elvers (n= 372,082) were this species. Glass-eels (age class 0) and age class I elvers predominated, although relative age class strengths varied considerably between seasons. Most elver activity occurred at dusk and dawn, but movement in daylight was observed during large migrations. Of various meteorological variables considered as possible influences on migration, water level was the most important and affected both periodicity and size of the migration. A delay of several days occurred between the peak water level of a flood and the peak of the following migration; for the mathematical model a delay of 5 days was the most appropriate to explain variations. The water temperature and number of elvers on the preceding day were also incorporated into the final model, which accounted for 76% of the error sum of squares. To test the predicatibility of the model, daily values for water level, water temperature and number of elvers for day 1 were supplied. The resulting series was in good agreement with both the observed and the calculated number of elvers.																			0028-8330	1175-8805					1983	17	1					1	15																WOS:A1983QR03300001
J	Barnett, HK; Paige, DK				Barnett, Heidy K.; Paige, Dwayne K.			Characteristics of Riverine Broadcast Spawning Pygmy Whitefish (Prosopium coulterii)	NORTHWEST SCIENCE												This study characterized spatial and temporal patterns associated with riverine broadcast spawning pygmy whitefish (Prosopium coulterii) in tributaries of Chester Morse Lake (CML), near Seattle, Washington, from 2001 to 2012. In most years, fish spawned in a narrow linear reach of riverine habitat from 2.0 to 3.0 km upstream of CML within a two week period. Individual characteristics of spawning pygmy whitefish were investigated through the use of mark-recapture efforts and a PIT (passive integrated transponder) tag antenna array. During the latter years of the study (2006-2011), a total of 3,012 fish were captured and PIT tagged. Returning female pygmy whitefish spent less time in the river (mean 2.4 days, SD 3.1) than males (mean 5.9 days, SD 2.4). In addition, 91% of all movements occurred between 1700 and 0700 during nighttime hours suggesting that spawning pygmy whitefish are most active under the cover of darkness. Thirteen fish returned for a fifth spawning migration and one individual was detected six years after initial tagging, demonstrating that pygmy whitefish spawn in multiple years and that fish can live to at least age nine in the CML population. These data represent the first attempt to investigate return frequency and other reproductive characteristics of riverine spawning pygmy whitefish throughout their range, and supports the development of practical management techniques for this and similar riverine broadcast spawning species.																			0029-344X	2161-9859				MAY	2014	88	2					155	168		10.3955/046.088.0209	http://dx.doi.org/10.3955/046.088.0209													WOS:000337219700007

A pronounced hyperplasia of gonadotropic cells in hybrids resulted in the accumulation of large stores of biologically active gonadotropin (GtH) in the pituitary gland. Serum GtH levels were generally higher in hybrids than in carp collected from the same areas, but seasonal trends were similar for both species. Among hybrids, tumored individuals had higher serum GtH levels than nontumored individuals. Serum levels and seasonal trends for testosterone (T), 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT), and estradiol-17.beta. (E2) were, for the most part, similar when carp and nontumored hybrids of the same gender were compared. Serum levels of T and 11-KT (but not E2) were generally higher in tumored hybrids when compared to nontumored individuals. High serum steroid levels were related to a specific tumor type, possibly of Sertoli cell origin. Although the etiology of the gonadaltumors is not yet kown, the serum levels of gonadal steroids in hybrids make it unlikely that a lack of steroidal feedback is responsible for the gonadotrope hyperplasia.

J	HESSEN, DO				HESSEN, DO			NICHE OVERLAP BETWEEN HERBIVOROUS CLADOCERANS - THE ROLE OF FOOD QUALITY AND HABITAT HOMOGENEITY	HYDROBIOLOGIA												In spite of resource limitation, five abundant species of herbivorous metazoan zooplankton in a humic lake exhibited extensive niche overlap both with regard to seasonal and spatial occurrence, time of reproductive maxima, juvenile release and food choice. Their coexistence could not be explained by modifying predation, environmental oscillations or recolonization. Laboratory bottle experiments indicated only weak interspecific interactions between the three tested species at low food levels, but negative interactions were induced at elevated food levels. Bosmina appeared as competitively inferior during enrichment with cultured algae, but as the superior species during starvation. At low nutrient levels, all species coexisted for several generations with low reproduction, in accordance with the lake situation. It was concluded that the observed niche overlaps would be promoted if; 1) Intraspecific competition is more important than interspecific competition. 2) All species are co-adapted to low nutrient availability, food is quantitatively in surplus, but qualitatively deficient (mainly recycled detritus). During such conditions, no species would be capable of obtaining a population increase until extinction of the other species. This situation may be typical of oligotrophic humic lakes, and of other localities with low predation pressure and high inputs of allochthonous particulate carbon.

Nine species of closely-related Mbuna bred throughout the year but all showed peaks of reproductive activity at times when food was most abundant. Most had a bimodal pattern of reproduction with a major peak in August to October, when plankton blooms were common, and another in February to March, when epilithic algae were plentiful. The smallest Mbuna species studied, Melanochromis joanjohnsonae, had a unimodal pattern, with high levels of reproductive activity extending for six to seven months of the year. Cyrtocara taeniolata, the only non-Mbuna studied, had a highly synchronized unimodal pattern of reproduction. This species produced the smallest eggs, had the highest relative fecundity and was the only species that employed parental care of free-swimming young.																			0952-8369	1469-7998				MAY	1986	209		1				9	20																WOS:A1986C533500002

Based on maternal Lineage determined by restriction enzyme analysis of mitochondrial DNA, northern (Ontario) populations segregated from both migratory and isolated eastern (New York) populations, which also differed from each other regionally. New York populations were distinguished by lower diversity and by the predominance of one haplotype in fish from migration-accessible streams. Ontario populations had higher, more evenly distributed diversity for both migratory and isolated populations. Haplotype frequency distribution for one Ontario population was dissimilar from that in neighbouring streams colonized earlier. A potential for differentiation was found between local sites within two Ontario streams. Repeated, sporadic introductions from multiple sources and population expansion probably account for high haplotypic diversity in Ontario populations. The lower diversity and distinctive haplotype of New York migratory populations, however, may be a consequence of recent massive stocking, which likely altered the original trajectory of population structuring.

J	UMANA, G				UMANA, G			THE PLANKTONIC COMMUNITY OF LAGUNA-HULE, COSTA-RICA	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												Laguna Hule is located in an explosion crater, north of Poas Volcano, Costa Rica, Central America, at an altitude of 740 m. It was sampled four times from August 1990 to June 199 1. Steep crater walls surround much of the lake, protecting it from wind action. The hypolimnion was anoxic on all visits, and a steep conductivity curve was always observed. This could mean that the lake is meromictic or at least oligomictic, rarely mixing completely. A shift was observed in the most probable limiting nutrient, corresponding to the seasonality of precipitation. A total of 80 species of algae were observed, most of which were rare. This resulted in high diversity values. Chlorophyta and Cyanobacteria were the dominant groups. with 60% of the species belonging to Chlorophyta. Although chlorophyll a values were high, secchi transparencies were also relatively high. Zooplankton was composed of a few species of rotifers (3), cladocerans (5) and one cyclopoid copepod. Most species were small herbivores. Chaoborus larvae were extremely abundant. The homed form of Ceriodaphnia cornuta was the most abundant, presumably in response to the high abundance of the predatory Chaoborus larvae.																			0034-7744					DEC	1993	41	3A					499	507																WOS:A1993PC55400022
J	CURRIE, DJ				CURRIE, DJ			DOES ORTHO-PHOSPHATE UPTAKE SUPPLY SUFFICIENT PHOSPHORUS TO PHYTOPLANKTON TO SUSTAIN THEIR GROWTH	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												It is generally supposed that phytoplankton obtain their P predominantly from orthophosphate uptake. Yet, phytoplankton are often observed to be responsible for only a very small fraction of the total planktonic community uptake of orthophosphate. Is this uptake of orthophosphate by algae nonetheless sufficient to meet their metabolic needs? To answer this question, I have compared the specific doubling rates of C and of P through orthophosphate uptake in the phytoplankton community of Lake Memphremagog. Orthophosphate uptake during the growing season supplied only a very small portion of the P required to support algal growth. Presumably, the phytoplankton obtained their P from some source other than orthophosphate uptake. Similar patterns of orthophosphate uptake in other P-limited lakes suggest that this phenomenon may be widespread.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				AUG	1986	43	8					1482	1487		10.1139/f86-185	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f86-185													WOS:A1986D371100002

Braun, light was shown to be the environmental factor having the major influence on daily diel malic acid/titratable acid fluctuations. In Lake Taupo (New Zealand), a large oligotrophic lake, seasonal variation in the level of diel fluctuations was demonstrated and this corresponded to changes in temperature, light, and daylength while Total Inorganic Carbon (TIC) remained relatively constant. However, in situ shading experiments demonstrated that, at any one time, the diel acid fluctuations were controlled by the ambient light levels as the other variables were constant. Laboratory experiments supported this and also showed that there was a close relationship between photosynthetic rates and deacidification when related to light intensity.																			0028-8330						1992	26	3-4					465	470		10.1080/00288330.1992.9516539	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1992.9516539													WOS:A1992KK79900016

The karstic exsurgence of the Dan has a seasonally stable output, a long stretch of strongly turbulent flow, stable temperature around 15.5.degree. C and high oxygen saturation. A total of 156 taxa, mainly at the species level, were identified from the river. These species are almost exclusively of Palearctic origin. About half of the species are limited to the northernmost part of Israel. The faunal complex described, does not present any longitudinal zonation for the 5 kilometers of turbulent flow; neither does it present seasonal changes in species composition. River Dan is considered to be a post-Pleistocenic river which has an important function of refugium for a wide area of aquatic waterbodies in the area, including the presently drained Lake Hula. It is suggested that in the Illies scheme of stream classification, River Dan might represent a type of stream belonging to a ''pseudorhithral'' along with other stenothermic warm water torrents of the tropical-subtropical climatic belt.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				APR 10	1986	134	2					121	140		10.1007/BF00006736	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00006736													WOS:A1986C146000005

J	Thompson, AB				Thompson, AB			Early life history of Engraulicypris sardella (Cyprinidae) in Lake Malawi	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Engraulicypris sardella is the basis of an important artisanal and subsistence fishery in Lake Malawi. It is a small pelagic cyprinid growing to a maximum length of 13 cm and is the only fish species in the lake known to have pelagic larvae. Seasonal abundance and vertical distribution patterns of larvae were investigated in the offshore pelagic zone from March 1992 to January 1994. There was no evidence that E. sardella is a pelagic spawner. Growth rates were estimated by counting rings on the asteriscus otolith, and biomass and production calculated using a length-dry weight regression relationship. Distinct seasonal patterns were observed in the total numbers, biomass, production, and mortality, of larvae that were similar in both years of sampling. Mortality of larvae was lowest from July to December and highest from January to April. Mortality was, on average, higher in the south of the lake, and lower in the central and northern region. Low mortality of larvae coincided with the windy mixed period when primary and secondary production were at a maximum, and correlated with an increased food supply at this time. It is suggested that the strength of the recruiting population is determined by mortality in the larval phase, rather than by the spawning stock biomass. Larvae were found to be most abundant in the upper 50 m of the water column during the day and were virtually absent below 250 m. Larvae moved down by an average of 50 m at night.																			0142-7873					AUG	1996	18	8					1349	1368		10.1093/plankt/18.8.1349	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/18.8.1349													WOS:A1996VE80800005

Atleast thirty-five plant species were eaten varying from trees to small herbs. Elephants mainly browsed in the woodland but also grazed at the lake shore. Feeding on woody species appeared to be in proportion to abundance. The relatively higher amount of grazing during the dry season is related negatively to periods of high rainfall. When rainfall is low, lake levels drop increasing the availability of lake-shore grassland, whereas during years of high rainfall the grassland is flooded and elephants resort to browsing as a major form of foraging.																			0141-6707	1365-2028				DEC	1989	27	4					325	333		10.1111/j.1365-2028.1989.tb01026.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2028.1989.tb01026.x													WOS:A1989CJ08600008

Using an index based on Daphnia size, we divided the lakes into two groups characterized as high and low fish predation. Overall, egg volumes were found to be a good predictor of energy reserves in stage 1 eggs of Holopedium. However, small eggs, which were associated with small females typical of the high predation lakes, had relatively less fat than large eggs, suggesting that fish predation indirectly reduces starvation resistance of Holopedium neonates. In addition, in high-fish lakes, mean adult body size, minimum size of ovigerous females, clutch size, and fat volumes of Holopedium were smaller than in lakes characterized as low fish predation. Maternal lipid investment (MLI) into eggs of Holopedium was compared between the two lake types. We found striking differences in the seasonal pattern of absolute MLI between the two lake groups, mostly mediated through differences in body size. The greatest difference in absolute MLI between the two lakes types occurred in May; females from the low-predation lakes invested 4 times as much energy reserves into reproduction as compared with females from the high-predation lakes at this time. Relative MLI (energy reserves per microgram female weight), comparing only individuals which overlapped in size, was unaffected by lake type. Thus a proportion population of an ovigerous female''s weight is invested in reproduction with a seasonal component that matches standard algal abundance for many shield lakes, suggesting that relative MLI is determined more by the exigencies of cladoceran life histories than by the presence of fish. Nevertheless, absolute energy investment is depressed in the high-predation lakes and we suggest that clonal replacement mediated by size-selective predation by the fish can account for the differences between the lake types.

The short term photosynthesis measurements did not show photoinhibition at high light intensities as did the in situ measurements. The time course of photoinhibition was studied. 14C techniques measured gross photosynthesis below the Ik of the in situ experiments. At Ph.A.R. [photosynthetically available irradiance) intensities above Ik photoinhibition is due to both photorespiration and a light dependent effect on electron transport. Vertical mixing processes in mixed water columns may be sufficient to prevent photoinhibition in natural populations. When the effect of temperature on the non-photoinhibited rate of gross photosynthesis is examined a universal response is revealed independent of species or season. No photosynthetic temperature adaptation is revealed; however, respiration rates (per milligram chlorophyll a) did show apparent seasonally adaptive trends.																			0003-9136						1977	80	4					405	457																WOS:A1977EB87200001

Such effects were compared with those of olive oil and uncontaminated food-exposed controls. The results confirm a pronounced cell damage which statistically not significant (p<0.05). In crude oil, the organelle changes were variable and highly comparable to that of DMBA. The nuclei were mostly disintegrated while the cell showed demarcation of cytoplasmic vacuolization, lipid augmentation, and mitochondrial aberrations. The latter showed a remarkable association with the rough endoplasmic reticulum and lipid droplets, and appeared as decayed and diffused structures within the cell matrix. There was no comparable changes in the hepatocytes of animals fed with uncontaminated food except for the formation of lipid droplets in the olive oil-fed groups. Although the animals food was contaminated with Kuwaiti weathered oil formed in 1991 were exposed to extreme seasonal temperatures, yet the residues of such oil led to severe histopathological alterations in the liver cells which were similar to those of DMBA-treated cells. There is the need to pay attention to potential hazardous effects of the crude oil on environments.																			0213-3911					JUL	1998	13	3					599	610											9690115					WOS:000075075100001
J	HARRIS, T				HARRIS, T			EUTROPHICATION OF LAKES AND RESERVOIRS IN THE UNITED-KINGDOM - CAUSES, EFFECTS AND CONTROLS	GEOGRAPHY												Enrichment of waterbodies by nutrients has been termed eutrophication. In most temperate-zone surface waters and lakes experiencing this process, phosphorus enrichment as a result of agricultural, domestic and industrial pollution is responsible for triggering increased primary production. This often leads to the development of algal blooms. Supplies of nitrogen may, however, be important in controlling the seasonal species composition of the bloom. Although lake biomass increases, eutrophication often causes a reduction in the diversity of large plants, fish and bottom-living organisms. Eutrophication can create a number of problems for human use of waterbodies. These include a decline in fishery status, the build-up of toxins in the water as algal blooms decay, and the blocking of sand filters used to purify drinking water. Methods used to combat eutrophication can be divided into two broad groups: those concerned with curing the ecological impacts of nutrient enrichment, and those concerned with preventing eutrophication from occurring.																			0016-7487					JAN	1995	80	346	1				60	71																WOS:A1995QG69600008

The material was collected every 48 h. Out of the total catch of 6897 specimens per m2, 75.1% belonged to the Chironomidae, 4.9% to the Chaoboridae, 15.4% to the Ephemeroptera and 3.2% to the Trichoptera. Endochironomus sp., Lauterborniella agrayloides, Polypedilum pullum (Chironomidae) and Oocetis testacea (Trichoptera) are reported for the first time from Lake Mindelsee. The seasonal course of the total emergence showed two distinct peaks: one at the end of July, the other at the beginning of September. Diurnal emergence was studied on two occasions, in July and in August. Most of the insects emerged during dusk and dawn. Species composition and degree of water mite infection of the collected nematocerans were studied. Host range and specific attachment sites of the different water mite taxa could only be established on the genus or family-level, with the exception of the most common water mite species Hydrodroma despiciens. In addition to its main host Chaoborus flavicans, this mite species infested 16 chironomid species with Corynoneura sp., Cryptocladopelma viridula, Pseudochironomus prasinatus and Tanytarsus lactescens as new records. The larvae of Hydrodroma despiciens were attached almost exclusively to the thorax of the imagines. Chaoborus flavicans, and within the Chironomidae Procladius sp. of the subfamily Tanypodinae, showed the highest average mite load. Species of the subfamily Chironominae were also heavily infested (e.g. Microtendipes sp., infestation rate 76% with a maximum mite load of 18). Within the representatives of the subfamily Orthocladiinae however, only low infestation rates occurred with maximum one larva per host. Finally, problems like the synchronization of the life-cycles of hosts and parasites and strategies of coexistence between the different water mite taxa parasitizing one host are discussed.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV 21	1988	169	2					149	166		10.1007/BF00007307	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00007307													WOS:A1988R409900003

The highest concentrations were observed near the river months during May to August, soon after pesticide application; hence they are transported mainly by surface runoff. Although these pesticides have been reported to be labile, concentrations of some of them, dispersed with the movement of the water, did not decrease rapidly in the natural aquatic environment. The highest concentrations, in 1985, of oxadiazon, isoprothiolane, diazinon, IBP, simetryne, benthiocarb and CSB were 0.66, 0.84, 0.16, 3.24, 3.23, 2.15 and 1.13 ppb, respectively.

J	KREMER, A; LARSON, PR				KREMER, A; LARSON, PR			GENETIC-CONTROL OF HEIGHT GROWTH COMPONENTS IN JACK PINE-SEEDLINGS	FOREST SCIENCE												Annual height increment (AHI) and its 2 components, number of stem units (NSU) and mean stem unit length (MSUL), were measured when both components were developing simultaneously during the 1st season and when preceded by a rest period during the 2nd season. Plant material consisted of 20 open-pollinated P. banksiana families comprising 4 provenances in the Lake States [USA] region. The seedlings were grown the 1st season in 2 controlled environment rooms that differed only in temperature, and they were grown in the 2nd season in a greenhouse. Measurements were made at the end of each growing season. In addition, seeds of each family were dissected and seedcoat, endosperm and embryo weights were obtained. Based on seed class effects, there was no maternal effect on height growth parameters (AHI, NSU, MSUL) for the 2 growing seasons. Provenance effects, detected only during the 2nd season, were significant for NSU and AHI; MSUL was controlled primarily by family-within-provenance effects. NSU and MSUL were negatively correlated on an environmental and genetic basis during both seasons. NSU was a better predictor of AHI on a provenance level, whereas MSUL was a slightly better predictor on a family-within-provenance level. Path analyses computed on family mean values showed that the path coefficient corresponding to MSUL was slightly superior to that corresponding to NSU. A significant part of both path coefficients was due to the negative correlation between the 2 components.

The possible influence of environmental parameters on the total fungal counts and occurrence of yeast species was examined. The lake showed thermal and oxygen homogeneity in June, and a stratification of temperature and oxygen in the water column during the period from September to March. The yeast species diversity decreased with depth probably due to the oxydative profile of the predominant species that could limit their distribution to the highly oxygenated surface waters. The most frequent species were Cryptococcus flavus, Rhodotorula minuta, Trichosporon cutaneum, Tr. pullulans and Aureobasidium pullulans. The yeast counts and species diversity were higher during the fairly months of December and March, and lower in the dry season. Trichosporon cutaneum was predominant in the dry season, and it was considered to be indigenous to the lake. The predominance of oxidative polytrophic yeasts and pigmented species suggested that the mycobiota of the lake was probably carried from soils and foliar surfaces. The yeast populations of Lagoa Santa lake would be formed by the constant efflux of transitory allochtonous species to die lake by rain and the catchment basin.					; Barbosa, Francisco/M-6225-2019; Morais, Paula/E-9794-2013	Resende Stoianoff, Maria Aparecida/0000-0002-6220-1321; Barbosa, Francisco Antonio/0000-0002-2026-6936; Morais, Paula/0000-0002-5050-5766; Rosa, Carlos/0000-0002-0056-9075													0001-3714					JUL-SEP	1996	27	3					182	188																WOS:A1996WC34100008

Growth usually began between April and June, peaked between July and Oct. and decreased by late Nov. Maximum biomass at 6 of the 7 sites (118-427 g dry weight m-2) was similar or greater than that reported in other rivers at similar latitudes. Seasonal growth of the abundant taxa followed 1 of 3 seasonal patterns at each study site; 1 dominant taxon grew alone; codominant taxa grew sympatrically without species succession; and codominant taxa grew sympatrically with species succession. Differences in growth and seasonal succession of some taxa were apparently caused by the presence or absence of overwintering plant material, competition and life-cycle differences.																			0008-4026						1985	63	6					1061	1065		10.1139/b85-145	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b85-145													WOS:A1985AMA6000012

Wild individuals in a certain developmental stage were collected, fed on natural food and examined until they had moulted twice. Natural development times fluctuated irrespective of temperature from May to October. Food deficiency delayed development in all feeding stages, and food availability probably determined natural development time. Serious food limitation raised mortality in copepodid stage I. In November development was delayed even with enough food. The development of E. japonicus was almost isochronal except for a short prefeeding naupliar stage I and a long copepodid stage V.																			0142-7873	1464-3774				NOV	1989	11	6					1261	1272		10.1093/plankt/11.6.1261	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/11.6.1261													WOS:A1989AZ05100011

The difference in seasonal mean levels is highly significant for almost all the parameters especially for intensity factors such as pH, temperature, clarity, and dissolved oxygen. The observed seasonal variations and temporal trends of key water quality parameters during the last in years generally indicate a worsening hypertrophic condition of the lake. Among the parameters that have shown continuing upward trends and have exceeded the allowable limits for water quality criteria for a fishery resource are ammonia-N, nitrate-N, ortho-P, chemical oxygen demand, turbidity, conductivity, chlorides, and hardness; while those that showed decreasing trends are alkalinity, pH, clarity, and dissolved oxygen. The negative ecological, economic and health implications of these observations particularly with regard to the continuing use of the lake as a fishery resource and source of domestic water supply, are discussed.																			0031-7454					MAR	2001	84	1					19	25																WOS:000168690800002

Floristically, the area is dominated by the large transition-zone between the Mediterranean and saharo-sindian regions. In general, vegetation types in north-central Saudi Arabia are dominated by Mediterranean flora, except on the Arabian Shield peneplains, where the vegetation is typical of the saharo-sindian deserts. Vegetation distribution on the landscape correlates with six general landscape units; however, our information on floristic composition and seasonal changes is not complete enough to create phytosociological units. Rocky, high relief areas support shrub and tree vegetation with tufted grasses and herbs; Rhus tripartita and Cymbopogon are common. Surrounding sandy pediments are covered by chenopods; primarily Anabasis and Hammada, along with Fagonia, Astragalus and many herbs. Wadis in the mountains support Acacia, and Lycium. Rhanterium, Ochradenus, Artemisia, and Baltota, and wool on the pediments support Fagonia and Astragalus are the dominant shrubs of the extensive serir plains of the Arabian Shield. Anabasis and Hammada are common on sandy plains, and the large, sandy wadis on the Arabian Shield support an Acacia-Panicum vegetation. Along the margins of playas located on the plains, the density of Rhanterium increases and Artemisia is present. The sand seas support a diffuse plant cover of shrubs and tufted grasses. Both the number of species and plant density are greater on dunes than on the bedrock plains. Cyperaceae, Artemisia monosperma, Calligonum comosum, Stipagrostis drarii and Cyperus conglomeratus are the most common plants. Achab floras are common at the foot of dunes following rainstorms, and Plantago, Monsonia, Stipagrostis plumosa, Moltkiopsis, and Filago are among the common herbs. A sparse cover of Helianthum and Fagonia is found on lake beds and duricrusts that are sometimes present in the interdunal depressions.																			0140-1963	1095-922X				MAY	1986	10	3					175	186		10.1016/S0140-1963(18)31237-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-1963(18)31237-0													WOS:A1986C306300002

SEDIMENT	RESERVOIR EUTROPHICATION: PREVENTIVE MANAGEMENT - AN APPLIED EXAMPLE OF INTEGRATED BASIN MANAGEMENT INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH												The present study evaluated the sediment of the Rio Verde Reservoir, located in the Curitiba metropolitan region. To this end, samples of the sediment profile were collected before and after the planting season (November, 2009 and June, 2010), by scuba diving and collecting samples using a 50cm PVC core. In 2009, the sediment was sampled at five points in the reservoir and in 2010 samples were taken at two points. Furthermore, interstitial water, water-sediment interface and water column were also analysed. The parameters assessed from the sediment samples included: grain size (granulometry); carbon and organic matter content; and the concentration of phosphorus, nitrogen, heavy metals and pesticides. Water samples were also collected for nutrient and pesticide assessment in the post-planting period. The reservoir sediment is an inorganic silt (organic matter content < 10%), with a neutral pH and very negative redox potential (an average of - 160mV). The concentration of Dissolved Oxygen in the bottom water of the reservoir was higher than 6.5mg/L at both points sampled in 2010. Total phosphorus concentrations in the sediment were low (33.2 mu g/g maximum). In the interstitial water, maximum values were approximately 350 mu g/L. The maximum concentration of total nitrogen in the sediment was 4.391 mu g/g. Both, the concentration of P and N were below the levels recommended in CONAMA legislation 344/2004. Pesticides were not detected in the sediment. Chromium was the only heavy metal detected with concentrations greater than the maximum values outlined by current legislation. However, due to the reducing state of the sediment, we believe that chromium does not have an immediate negative effect on the biota. However, more detailed and longer-term studies are needed to evaluate chromium toxicity on the biota at the concentration found in the Rio Verde reservoir. Considering the physicochemical states of the sediment and the underlying water, we also speculate that a release of P into the water column, although minimal, is possible in anoxic conditions. However, the impact of this release on the phytoplankton population is unknown and should be further investigated.																					978-1-78040-648-0; 978-1-78040-647-3				2014							193	215																WOS:000346779200012

Modelling of organic sedimentation is important to understand climate-driven changes in past carbon storage and explore scenarios of future evolution. The main difficulty is to separate the effects of climate change, human activity and the high natural variability of river basins, and to consider the non-stationary sediment records. Basins of mountainous lakes are less affected by human actions and represent a good indicator of how climate variability drives the sediment delivery and carbon accumulation. Alpine basins, in particular, are interesting cases for evaluating simplified approaches to the modelling of annual sediment yields. The model developed in this study (TOCCLIM) extracts percentiles and runoff from the seasonal rainfall data to estimate how changes in the rainfall pattern can influence the fluxes of total organic carbon (TOC). The TOCCLIM was evaluated in the Lake Thun (Switzerland) and used to reconstruct the hydroclimatic forcing of the TOC back to 1600. Land-use changes were taken into account only through feedbacks on the precipitation regimes. We show that some predictive skill can be obtained for inter-to-multidecadal analysis.

In the present study, we elaborated the impact of human activities on the water-sediment relation based on the water and sediment features at Datong Station (1951-2008). The results showed that the annual runoff of several years was slightly increased in 1990s in Yangtze River (Yangtze) River estuary. The changes were not obvious in these years. The suspended sediment flux (SSF) showed a phased downward trend, which was associated with water storage of the Three Gorges reservoir, the middle- and down-stream river-lake relationship, artificial sand excavation and water drinking and regulation. The ratio average of suspended sediment less than 0.01mm and 0.05mm was increased from 1987 to 2002 than the value before 1986. The value reached the maximal in 2003, and afterwards the sediment flux ratio of these two particle sizes was decreased. After 1986, the total SSF was reduced. The SSF less than 0.01mm showed a wavy decline along with the increase of suspended sediment ratio, while the SSF less than 0.05mm was decreased along with the reduction of the total suspended sediment flux. Meanwhile, the average of median suspended sediment particle size was 0.027mm before 1986 and was 0.0094mm from 1987 to 2008. The inflexion point appearing in 1986 was consistent with the inflexion point of SSF reduction. It was directly related to water storage of the Gezhouba Dam. The median particle diameter of riverbed sand had an increase of 0.01mm/10a in average after 1977. The maximal particle diameter of riverbed sand had changed little. Both suspended sediment and bed sand became fine along the estuary and slightly became coarse in the mouth, indicating that it was functioned as the estuarial filter. The above observations would provide valuable insights for science and objective evaluation of the effect of human activities on an estuary.																			1660-9336		978-3-03835-005-7				2014	501-504						2049	2055		10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.501-504.2049	http://dx.doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.501-504.2049													WOS:000339031501128

The flight path includes two lakes of different sizes and, additionally, a forested area and an open, mostly agricultural area next to the lakes. This allows us to compare the behavior of the brightness temperature of snow on lake ice with that of snow on terrain. The main airborne instrument is our HUTRAD system, which operates at 6.9, 10.65, 18.7, 23.8, and 36.5 GHz, providing data for both vertical and horizontal polarization at an incidence angle of 50 degrees off nadir. The antenna beamwidth is 3 to 5 degrees depending on frequency. Additional data have been collected with our HUT-2D interferometric imaging radiometer, which operates at 1.4 GHz and looks straight down covering an incidence angle range up to 25 degrees with a swath of 95 per cent of the flight altitude. The radiometers are accommodated on our Skyvan research aircraft. In-situ measurements have been made simultaneously with airborne data collection. We have covered a variety of conditions including dry snow/ice, occasional water on top of ice, moist snow surface, and the melting season. In order to study the effect of diurnal temperature variations during the melting season we have collected data both in the morning (dry refrozen snow) and afternoon (moist topmost snow layer).

Seed dynamics and control of Pistia stratiotes in two aquatic systems in Botswana	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												The fruiting and seed dynamics of the alien invasive aquatic species Pistia stratiotes L. (water lettuce; Araceae) was investigated in the seasonally flooded Selinda Canal and Zibadianja Lake of the Kwando-Linyanti River system and in the perennial Chobe River, Botswana, in 1999-2003. The mean number of 30.3 seeds fruit-1 in the Selinda Canal is the highest ever recorded. An artificial earthen barrier or dyke was constructed on the Selinda Canal to allow manipulation of water levels downstream. By drying and subsequently reflooding a region of the stream, seed germination was stimulated, followed by the manual removal of water lettuce seedlings before their seeds reached maturity, which resulted in a decline in seed germination in surface sediment samples from 63.5% in 2002 to 31.7% in 2003. Manipulation of flooding, followed by the physical removal of P. stratiotes at regular intervals prior to anthesis and seed maturity, is considered the most viable strategy for arresting further additions to the seed bank, and could lead to its eradication in seasonally flooded areas where the biocontrol weevil Neohydronomus affinis has become locally extinct since its introduction in 1987.																			1608-5914	1727-9364					2014	39	2					209	214		10.2989/16085914.2014.905449	http://dx.doi.org/10.2989/16085914.2014.905449													WOS:000338829000010

These man-made ecosystems have certain areas with high biological diversity, including both remnant species and species purposefully or unintentionally introduced by human actions. There can be important habitats and valuable corridors for both common and less common species within the urban sprawl. The main aim of this study is to respond to the call for integrative research by studying relationships between the anthropogenic activities and urban biodiversity of the cities from the southern part of Rajasthan, India. We observed that the local population was interested in biodiversity, especially phenological events, and benefited from it by getting aesthetic pleasure and information on seasonal changes. The cities, such as Udaipur have an artificially developed diversified habitat within urban limits which provides shelter and protection to a variety of flora and fauna species. Urban areas are often rich in species, particularly vascular plants and many groups of animals, especially birds. Further, urban green spaces in the form of artificial parks and agricultural fields have the diversity of flora, whereas artificial lakes are the sites of wetland species. The most eye-catching faunal group of birds was used to understand the importance of biodiversity for Udaipur. Bird diversity and abundance are indicators of the condition of watershed habitats, both terrestrial and wetland. The role of urban areas in functions, such as the provision of ecosystem services will largely be determined by patterns of biodiversity within that area. To keep these biological indicators healthy, watershed conditions should be managed to encourage bird survival and reproduction. Further, to support an integrative approach in urban green planning, both ecological and social research has to be incorporated in the planning process.

S	Ohtsuka, T		Usio, N; Miyashita, T		Ohtsuka, Taisuke			Nursery Grounds for Round Crucian Carp, Carassius auratus grandoculis, in Rice Paddies Around Lake Biwa	SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION IN PADDY-DOMINATED LANDSCAPES	Ecological Research Monographs											Since the turn of the twenty-first century, two means of promoting the use of rice paddies as fish nursery ground have been implemented around Lake Biwa in Japan. One involves fish culture: newly hatched or pre-flexion larvae are released into rice paddies after the rice transplantation, and then reared to juveniles before the mid-season drainage. The other involves the installation of fish passes to enhance the entry of adult fish into paddies and encourage their natural reproduction there. These efforts mainly aim to enhance the reproduction of round crucian carp (nigorobuna), Carassius auratus grandoculis, an endangered endemic subspecies inhabiting Lake Biwa, which is also the principal ingredient in funa-zushi, a specialty food of Shiga Prefecture. Both methods are regarded as environment-friendly and thus are well supported by local people. Our studies on the rice paddy food chain revealed, however, that the impact of round crucian carp larvae/juveniles on aquatic biota in rice paddies is profound. Fish predation results in an extreme reduction of Cladocera, and a concomitant increase in the food species and competitors of cladocerans. Through their benthic foraging, juvenile fish also cause a rise in total phosphorus concentration and phytoplankton in the paddy water. In addition, scarce competitors and predators in the paddies contribute to the rapid growth and low mortality of the fish larvae/juveniles. Although the employment of rice paddies as fish nursery ground may be effective for the conservation of round crucian carp, other approaches are also needed to enhance the overall biodiversity of rice paddy areas around Lake Biwa.																			2191-0707		978-4-431-55330-4; 978-4-431-55329-8				2014							139	164		10.1007/978-4-431-55330-4_10	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-4-431-55330-4_10	10.1007/978-4-431-55330-4												WOS:000357874600011

The Ardeid colony consists of 330 adults; 150 of which are Night Heron (45.45%) and 180 are Little Egrets (54.55%). The breeding period starts at the end of March and lasts till the end of August. Neither the Night Herons nor the Little Egrets become active in the breeding period simultaneously. Due to the fact that the Little Egret is a species that is active in daytime and the Night Heron is active at night, making colonial activity continuous throughout the day and night (24 hours). While this situation limits the competition between the species, it provides advantages in terms of breeding success and colonial life.

The lake is situated close to an urban area, and is characterised by high pumpkinseed abundance. The study was carried out for a period of 105 days during the active pumpkinseed breeding season (from May to August). Five sites along the littoral area of the lake, with different habitat characteristics were selected. Each site was divided into two sections - an experimental and a control section. The plastic bottles (cut into two) were fixed to the lake bottom in the area of the experimental sections. Pumpkinseeds actively used the artificial substrate for nesting and the average use of each bottle was 2.3 times. Simultaneously, on the natural substrate of the experimental sections a total of 372 nests were built. The results showed that the choice of artificial substrate was neither associated with the type of bottom substrate, nor the remaining environmental traits that were studied. However, the use of artificial substrate has made a significant contribution to the total number of nests only on sites with "unsuitable" habitat parameters. These results show that waste products can seriously facilitate pumpkinseed's abundance.

The hydrological condition in the common-water year (2010) was used for a yearly numerical simulation to investigate the water and sediment exchange mechanisms. The results showed that: The annual water volume flowing to the Yangtze River from Poyang Lake was about 2.17x10(11) m(3). Due to the periodical jacking influence of the external water level, about 1.06x10(10) m(3) water quantity flowed back into the Lake from the Yangtze River. The water exchange between Poyang Lake and the Yangtze River varied evidently with seasons, which was mainly concentrated in March and September. The annual sediment exported from Poyang Lake to the Yangtze River was about 1.53x10(7) t, and the amount of sediment flowing back to the lake was about 1.89x10(6) t.

ESTIMATION OF THE POPULATION SIZE OF CAPOETA UMBLA (HECKEL, 1843) IN THE LAKE HAZAR (ELAZIG) BY REMOVAL METHOD	DIGEST JOURNAL OF NANOMATERIALS AND BIOSTRUCTURES												Fish populations in smaller aquatic environments are affected by the fishing pressure at a much faster pace. Often, compensation of this effect either takes a long time or is not possible at all. For the purposes of establishing fishing regulations in these water environments, the removal method is able to provide results quickly and almost accurately. The Lake Hazar, which is the environment of our study, is 8,600 hectares in size, and is a natural lake where Capoeta umbla species is caught commercially using gill nets. In this study, stock size of Capoeta umbla in the Lake Hazar (Elazig) was estimated using removal method. In addition, the power of fishing and the status of fishing yield in the lake were evaluated. In our research, it was determined that seven commercial fishing boats caught 25,721 kg of fish in the lake in a fishing season. CPUE was calculated as 1.55 kg (kg/day/a gill net). As a result of the regression analysis, the amount of stock in the lake was the estimated to be 37,781 kg (+/- 14,001 kg). When cumulative catch was formulated as recommended by Ricker (1975), the population size was estimated to be 38,649 kg (+/- 15,007 kg). As a result of our study, the use of removal method was found to be appropriate for small reservoirs with reduced population density due to strong fishing pressure.

At Donnacona, a sequence of non-glacial sediments is intercalated between a lower glacial complex and the Gentilly Till. The lower complex consists of a basal till, ice margin deposits, a diamicton, some varves, a till and an upper rudite. The intermediate stratified sequence includes three units: silt and sand with plant debris, dated at > 35,000 BP (UQ-678), stratified coarse sands and a massive silt. The paleoenvironments are assessed from the pollen spectra and concentrations, the taxonomic diversity and the sedimentology. The pollen diagram is divided into four palynozones by statistical treatment. Pollen study demonstrates that the intermediate stratified deposits at Donnacona are younger than the St. Pierre Sediments, except a thin lower zone (palynozone Donnacona 1 with dominant Picea and Abies) which is correlated with the upper part of the St. Pierre Sediments. The remainder of the unit with plant debris is correlated with the Saint-Maurice Rhythmites. Pollen analysis revealed that this unit contains seasonal rhythmites. The pollen content (palynozone Donnacona 2) indicates that a southern Abies forest, which included thermophilous species such as Tsuga and Tilia, was gradually replaced by a Picea forest. The coarse sand unit contains the Donnacona 3 and the lower part of Donnacona 4 palynozones. It is related to the Vieilles-Forges Sands and to a climatic deterioration. The unit below Gentilly Till was deposited in a glacial lake coeval with a forest tundra and later with a tundra (upper part of palynozone Donnacona 4).																			0705-7199						1991	45	2					125	140		10.7202/032856ar	http://dx.doi.org/10.7202/032856ar													WOS:A1991GG73100002
J	FREMPONG, E				FREMPONG, E			A SEASONAL SEQUENCE OF DIEL DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS FOR THE PLANKTONIC DINOFLAGELLATE CERATIUM-HIRUNDINELLA IN A EUTROPHIC LAKE	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Diel depth-distribution patterns of C. hirundinella were studied during 11 sampling periods, covering the seasonal growth cycle. They resulted from short-term periodic or non-periodic external factors, endogenous responses of the alga, and interactions between these. Diel variations in wind stress resulted in the net transport of algae into or out of the sampling position due to lateral water movements. A progressive surface accumulation of Ceratium, leading to a 3-fold increase in cell numbers at the sampling site over a 24 h period, was due to wind-induced upwelling of deeper cells. Near-surface accumulation of Ceratium on a completely overcast afternoon, similar to that associated with migrations, was attributable to advection. Under sufficiently calm conditions, depth-differentiation of Ceratium was regulated by its vertical swimming movements with a diel periodicity. Migration patterns observed in earlier work were confirmed and extended. The alga migrated towards the surface during the daytime and downward during the night; this rhythm had an endogenous component. At high surface illumination, the alga retreated from the surface and formed discrete sub-surface maxima; at low irradiance Ceratium showed positive phototaxis and concentrated near the surface. Under either condition of irradiance Ceratium actively aggregated at depths associated with irradiance levels of about 125-155 .mu.Einsteins m-2 s-1. Downward movement was restricted by anoxic conditions and possibly by thermal/density gradients. Given sufficient light penetration, dissolved O2 and nutrient availability, the thermal density gradient does not apparently eliminate downward movement by Ceratium.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1984	14	4					401	421		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1984.tb00163.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1984.tb00163.x													WOS:A1984TD49100006
J	HARE, L; CARTER, JCH				HARE, L; CARTER, JCH			DIEL AND SEASONAL PHYSICOCHEMICAL FLUCTUATIONS IN A SMALL NATURAL WEST-AFRICAN LAKE	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												The waters of Opi Lake were very dilute (15-24 .mu.S cm-1 at 25.degree. C) and somewhat acid (pH 6.0-6.5), probably a result of the highly leached lateritic soils in its small drainage basin. Annual minimum water temperatures were recorded during the early dry season, not during the rainy season as has been observed in most other West African water bodies. This was attributed to the influence of the Harmattan winds on the lake and the absence of pronounced rainy season flooding, as might occur in reservoirs. A diel cycle of daytime thermal stratification and complete or near-complete nighttime destratification occurred throughout the year. During the dry season, when prevailing winds were strong and lake depth shallow, nighttime destratification was accompanied by deep circulation. In the rainy season, when prevailing winds were weak and lake depth was greatest, deep vertical circulation apparently did not take place, as evidenced by anoxia in near-bottom waters. This is the reverse of the pattern seen in many tropical lakes.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1984	14	6					597	610		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1984.tb00179.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1984.tb00179.x													WOS:A1984TV42600004
J	MELACK, JM				MELACK, JM			TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF PHYTOPLANKTON IN TROPICAL LAKES	OECOLOGIA												Temporal variability of ecological systems continues to receive theoretical and empirical attention but remains inadequately documented at low latitudes. Results of phytosynthetic rates of phytoplankton in 6 equatorial African lakes and similar information from 20 South American, Asian and African lakes studied by others provide the data for an assessment of the range of seasonal variability (expressed as coefficients of variation, CV) among tropical lakes. Sampling intervals varied from 1 wk - 3 mo. and usually spanned at least 1 yr. Within Africa the CV ranged from 15-61%, and among all the lakes the CV ranged from 15-86%. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient of the CV of photosynthesis vs. latitude is 0.24 and is not significant at the 0.05 level. Coefficients of variation of photosynthetic rates of phytoplankton in a diverse set of 45 temperate and arctic lakes ranged from 29-155% and were significantly different from the set of 26 tropical lakes by the Mann-Whitney U test. When all 71 lakes are compared, the Spearman rank correlation coefficient of CV of photosynthesis vs. latitude is 0.71 and is significant at the 0.0005 level. Three temporal patterns were recognized among tropical lakes. Most tropical lakes exhibit pronounced seasonal fluctuations that usually correspond with variations in rainfall, river discharges or vertical mixing. A 2nd pattern occurs in lakes with muted fluctuations (coefficient of variation less than 20%) in which diel changes often exceed month to month changes. A 3rd pattern is distinguished by an abrupt change from one persistent algal assemblage (i.e., extant for at least 10 generations) and level of photosynthetic activity to another persistent condition.																			0029-8549	1432-1939					1979	44	1					1	7		10.1007/BF00346388	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00346388								28310454					WOS:A1980JA23800001

For 2 relatively short periods of the year, during the middle of both wet and dry seasons, competition for breeding sites between these fishes was intense. Over 90% of all territories were lost prior to completing a breeding cycle. Cichlid pairs in shallow water tended to be more successful and breeding sites in these areas were more vigorously contested. The seasonal pattern of breeding was bimodal with a different species complex breeding in the wet season as contrasted to the dry. In the wet season C. citrinellum aggressively excluded all but the 2 smallest species from breeding in rocky areas. In the dry season, when C. citrinellum was not breeding, all other species were able to breed, but they, in turn, were separated within that season by both depth and timing of breeding.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1977	58	2					291	302		10.2307/1935604	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1935604													WOS:A1977DN32600005

Fishes were sampled with nets and seines (0.3-mm mesh) in open water and at the shore from May to October, 1989, 1990, and 1991. The highly diverse young-of-the-year fish community reflects unfragmented heterogeneous habitats that range from exposed rock and sand shores to densely vegetated embayments and marshes. Fishes (89 000 specimens) were represented by 9 reproductive guilds, 16 families, and 38 taxa. Cyprinids, centrarchids, and percids dominated collections; common and abundant species included Perca flavescens (56% of total catch), Lepomis gibbosus (18%), and Alosa pseudoharengus (8%). Generally, fewer species at lower mean densities occurred in unaltered habitats than in altered areas. Large spatial and temporal differences were observed in peak density and mean total lengths of most species collected on the same date at several sites. Fish species diversity and abundance were consistently highest in mixed submersed plants and lowest in open water and on exposed shores.																			0008-4301					NOV	1994	72	11					1887	1897		10.1139/z94-257	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z94-257													WOS:A1994QQ13100005
J	RODKIN, MV				RODKIN, MV			HYDROSEISMICITY - NEW EVIDENCE	JOURNAL OF GEODYNAMICS												The model of hydroseismicity relates variations of the hydrological state of the earth's crust to seismicity through the weakening of rocks by fluids and the transfer of stresses from hydrologically affected regions into seismogenic regions. The model has been tested by a number of statistical analyses. One such analysis is correlating the Caspian Sea water imbalances over the years with the regional seismicity with a time delay between the two. The correlation is significantly positive if seismicity leads by up to 1a, and negative if seismicity is delayed by 3-5a relative to the water imbalance. This is interpreted by water being expelled from the crust into the lake by compressive seismic activity and with a delay by the inflow of water into the seismogenic layer from the lake. Significant seasonal variations of seismicity have been found to exist in several parts of the world. These variations also correlate with precipitation, but generally there is a delay of the seismicity by a few months. This is a plausible result if one considers that water has to flow from the source (lake bottom, earth's surface) to the seismically active depths; the delay times agree with seismogenic depths of a few kilometres to about 10 km (in the Caspian Sea area). However, there are many open questions, e.g. why there does not seem to be much correlation of the seasonal effect with the different climates.

However, the obtained results have been compared to action levels relevant to other latitudes and the investigations have not included other trace metals of sanitary interest. The present study contributed to understanding the spatial geochemical response controlled by hydrological pulse and organic matter (OM) composition within the Ayapel Flood Plain Lake influence area. We assessed the seasonal and spatial variations of mercury (Hg), lead (Pb), and chromium (Cr) content in recent Ayapel Flood Plain Lake sediments and then compared them with the determined local pollution level of Hg (0.032 mu g g(-1)), Pb (2.39 mu g g(-1)) and Cr (89.58 mu g g(-1)) found in Betulia Formation. The ranges of metal content were 0.008-0.117 mu g Hg g(-1), 1.090-11.870 mu g Pb g(-1) and 5.350-93.430 mu g Cr g(-1). Hg showed the largest spatial variation (0.083 +/- 0.064 mu g g(-1)) and the highest values at the distributaries of the former gold mining fronts. About 91% of samples displayed Pb enrichment (6.376 +/- 4.048 mu g g(-1)) and 66.6% Hg enrichment when compared with the reference levels. In contrast, Cr content was relatively low (96.325 +/- 29.868 mu g g(-1)) and showed a decreasing trend from East towards West. The sediment was mainly inorganic (88.154 +/- 3.822 %) with depleted OM levels (11.846 +/- 3.822 %). The results suggested enhanced Hg motility owing to a high respiration rate of OM about the centre of the main water table. The sediment resuspension and migration was facilitated by thermal instability of the water column influenced by wind action.																			0120-6230	2422-2844				DEC	2013		69					244	255																WOS:000329274000020

There is a good coherence between seasonal variations of the Neva River flow and the salinity regime in the upper layer of the Baltic Sea. Near the shores periods of low, normal and high salinity correspond to the periods of high, normal and low river runoff, and the same trends are observed with some time lag in the open parts of the Sea as well. The impacts of the Neva River discharge oscillations on salinity of the Gulf of Finland surface waters are analyzed in terms of time regression probability models. The obtained river flow-marine salinity transfer functions summarize well the observation data on both multiannual and seasonal scales of variability. Some seasonal periods with different anomalies of the influence are distinguished.																			0018-8158					APR 12	1996	322	1-3					99	102		10.1007/BF00031812	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00031812													WOS:A1996UT84700016

Some variation in slope of published regressions is attributable to the choice of different regression subvariables (e.g., annual mean or annual maximum). The extent of this variation is quantified. Data from Lake Burragorang and other sites indicate that chlorophyll-P relationships in the Southern Hemisphere are concordant with those in the north if turbid waters are excluded from consideration. This is obviously significant in Australia, with so many turbid waters. The notion of growing season, as applied to Northern Hemisphere studies, is inappropriate for the warm temperate conditions of Lake Burragorang, and it was necessary instead to use the annual maximum chlorophyll concentration. Prediction of annual maximum chlorophyll concentration is of particular significance to water-quality management. Despite highly significant regressions, 95% confidence intervals and 95% prediction limits are wide, so that prediction of chlorophyll concentration from single values of total P, using double-natural log regressions, gives a wide arithmetic range. Use of annual mean total P concentration as the predictor variable limits the forecasting ability of the Lake Burragorang regressions but facilitates future coupling with a P loading model. This would assist in the assessment of projected management plans and the formulation of protective loading criteria.																			0067-1940						1985	36	2					157	168		10.1071/MF9850157	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF9850157													WOS:A1985AFC8300003

Interspecific differences at La Grande River were more apparent than intraspecific differences in life history traits of cisco and lake whitefish over the James-Hudson Bay range. Although cisco exhibit decreasing reproductive effort independent of growth over the North American range, thus conforming to life history theory, both growth and reproductive effort are reduced northwards over their James-Hudson Bay range. Physiological constraints related to the shorter growing season at the northern limit of cisco''s coastal Hudson Bay range may overwhelm expected coadapted life history traits. Lake whitefish exhibit reduced reproductive effort independent of variations in growth northwards over their North American and James-Hudson Bay coastal range; this suggests coadaptation of life history traits that permit survival at northern sites.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1982	39	7					958	967		10.1139/f82-131	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f82-131													WOS:A1982PA93100005

R. and S. and Juncus pelocarpus f. submersus Fassett, were studied in a softwater lake. Analysis of segregation indicated a nonrandom arrangement of individual rosettes of each species with respect to rosettes of the other species. Factors influencing growth of the species were examined using de Wit replacement series replicated 4 times at 5 ratios, under 3 environmental treatments: Sphagnum peat, double field density, shading and a control. Plants grown in pure culture showed no significant difference in yield between the 2 spp. When plants were grown in mixture, there were significant differences between speices. Yields of both species were significantly different among environmental treatments. A significant effect of Eleocharis:Juncus ratio in the double density treatment resulted from interference among conspecific neighbors. Relative Yield Totals ranged from 0.84-1.0 for all 4 treatments, and ratio diagrams indicate stable coexistence through the growing season under all 4 environmental regimes. Interspecific interference was less important than environmental factors and intraspecific interference in determining growth in these experiments. Eleocharis and Juncus are nonrandomly intermingled, and can coexist under a variety of environmental manipulations. This outcome is consistent with their reported distributions in nature. The mechanism that permits this stable coexistence awaits explanation.

The seasonal pattern of the dynamics of these chemical constituents is described for depth and time and relates closely to the pattern of thermal stratification and mixing previously described. Interactions between the chemical constituents are examined and comparisons are made among the 4 lakes which differ widely in their depth, exposure to wind and standing crops of phytoplankton. The vertical distribution of the chemical constituents is used to help define the limits of circulation of surface waters and the need to understand the seasonality of chemical stratification in relating climatic, morphometric and biological events, especially in tropical lakes, is stressed.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1984	14	6					551	573		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1984.tb00176.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1984.tb00176.x													WOS:A1984TV42600001

Seasonal depth profiles of temperature, oxygen, nutrients ana other physicochemical features usually indicated two distinct layers with a metalimnion between 10-25 m depth in a lake with a mean depth of 36 m. The epilimnion was well-oxygenated and was between 1.6 and 3.3-degrees-C warmer than the deoxygenated hypolimnion. Elevated concentrations of nitrite, ammonium, soluble reactive phosphorus, iron, manganese, major cations and silica in the hypolimnion indicated prolonged stability of the water column. Analysis, by x-ray fluorescence, of ashed sediment samples from fifty-five sites showed that elements affected by redox processes (Mn, Fe and P) had become concentrated in the deeper sediments. Conversely, Ca and Sr were concentrated in littoral sediments and concentrations of Zr, Ti, Mg, Ga, Ni, Y, Zn, Pb and Nd were highest near the major inflows. Stratification disruption occurs irregularly (and probably rarely) following the coincidence of cold weather and strong winds. In September 1990, a tilted oxycline, fish deaths and high concentrations of particulate iron were recorded in areas of hypolimnetic upwelling. The interplay of water column stability and disruption explains the distinct patterns of redox elements in the surface sediments. The patterns are further modified by the hydrology of the lake. Inflowing waters are significantly cooler than epilimnetic waters and therefore dissolved and suspended materials entering the lake are probably deposited directly in the hypolimnion. The proximity of the major inflows to the outflow and the shallowness of the outflow accentuate the role of the Kutubu basin as a materials sink. This conclusion is supported by the very high concentrations of iron (up to 19.8 % Fe2O3), phosphorus (up to 1.74 % P2O5) and manganese (up to 1.56 % MnO) in sediments from the deeper parts of the lake.																			0003-9136					JUN	1992	124	4					427	449																WOS:A1992JD04700003
J	LEMLY, AD; DIMMICK, JF				LEMLY, AD; DIMMICK, JF			GROWTH OF YOUNG-OF-THE-YEAR AND YEARLING CENTRARCHIDS IN RELATION TO ZOOPLANKTON IN THE LITTORAL-ZONE OF LAKES	COPEIA												Correlations were determined between the growth/body condition of centrarchids age 0+ to 1+ and the abundance of specific taxa of zooplankton in the littoral zone of 3 lakes in piedmont North Carolina [USA] over a period of 8 mo. Stomach analyses were conducted, and electivity indices were calculated to provide comparative data. Body condition, growth rate, and zooplankton abundance were significantly different between lakes (P < 0.05, ANOVA [analysis of variance]). First year growth and changes in body condition of age 0+ for Lepomis, Pomoxis and Micropterus spp. were positively correlated with the abundance of copepod nauplii and copepodids in each lake (mean rs = 0.898, P < 0.01). The abundance of adult copepods was also frequently correlated with growth and body condition, but at a lower level of probability (mean rs = 0.713, P < 0.05). The number of significant correlations dropped sharply as fish age increased to 1+ yr. Significant associations could not be generated using data for Rotifera, Protozoa or Ostracoda, and were infrequent for Cladocera. Copepod nauplii and copepodids are probably primary food during the critical period when larval centrarchids switch from endogenous to exogenous nutrition. The correlation data were supported by stomach analyses and electivity indices which indicated 0+ fishes to be utilizing mainly copepods, supplemented with cladocerans, insect larvae, and fishes in the more piscivorous species. The mean prey size for larval bluegill and largemouth bass (.ltoreq. 15 mm total length) was 0.48 mouth gape and 0.60 mouth gape, respectively, which translates to prey sizes of 0.11-0.35 mm during the larval stage. Due to mouth size during the period of 1st feeding, most adult copepods and cladocerans are too large to be ingested even if prey could be handled with dimensions approaching 0.99 mouth gape. The relative insignificance of Cladocera in the diet of post-larval fishes appears to be due to negative selection rather than to influences of seasonal abundance or encounter probability. In these North Carolina lakes, cladocerans are not so universally important in the diet of age 0+ centrarchids as studies on northern and midwestern lakes would indicate. Correlations, stomach analyses and electivity indices can be integrated into a multiple factor approach to diet studies, allowing consideration of several environmental and population variables and yielding more meaningful results than by using 1 method alone. Potential impacts of aquatic pollution on food organisms required during the 1st weeks of feeding should place additional priority on diet studies and ecological relationships between centrarchids and the littoral zone.																			0045-8511	1938-5110					1982		2					305	321		10.2307/1444609	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1444609													WOS:A1982NS37600008

Weekly samples were gathered from several depths in both the euphotic and dysphotic zones. The fraction 0.2-45 .mu.m showed elevated primary production and weak energy charge percentages confirming the generally accepted idea about the increase of metabolical cell processes with lower cell size. We have also looked for the ecophysiological significance of the energy charge through its seasonal coupling with primary production. The highly significant negative correlations obtained between CE and primary production for the three fractions indicate that the pool of adenine nucleotides evolves towards forms less charged with a high energy phosphate bond. However, some exceptions to this rule were noticed in April and June (both CE and photosynthetic activity were high). This observation derived from in situ studies showed the difficulties encountered in natural environments when we try to check the ecophysiological significance of the energy charge.																			0932-4739	1618-0429				JUL 7	1989	24	4					381	391		10.1016/S0932-4739(89)80008-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0932-4739(89)80008-2								23195729					WOS:A1989AE71200008

It was shown that the spatial distribution of the carbonate system components was strongly subjected to hydrophysical factors, while the seasonal dynamics of the pCO(2) and C-tot values were mainly determined by biochemical factors. The formation of the hydrochemical structure of the Pechora Sea waters was determined by two water masses: the surface waters of the Barents Sea (relative contribution of 50-60%) and the waters of Pechora Bay (relative contribution about 40%). A certain influence may also be exerted by the water of lagoons, their relative contribution amounting, in selected cases, up to 10%. The formation of the lagoon waters is mainly caused by the surface waters of the Pechora Sea (up to 70%), by the waters of Pechora Bay (from 13 to 30%), and by the runoff waters of melt lakes (from 15 to 30%).																			0001-4370					MAR-APR	2005	45	2					202	207																WOS:000229091000007

Samples were collected from decomposing leaves and from the water column from ice-out in April to late August. Most of the algae present were attached forms. While there were some differences at the genus level, both temporary and permanent sites were largely dominated by filamentous chlorophytes (e.g., Oedogonium genera) immediately after ice-out. Subsequent to this early season bloom, the communities became more taxon rich, with diatoms (especially Pinnularia spp.) predominating at the permanent site, which also supported the highest diversity (30 genera). At the genus level, the community composition at the intermittent sites were subsets of that found at the permanent site. Many of these genera are known to produce a gelatinous matrix, or have a partially gelatinous structure - both advantageous to surviving drought. Using cell counts, the Cyanophyta (Cyanobacteria) appeared to be the most important community constituents; however, biovolume showed that the Chlorophyta and Bacillariophyta were the dominant groups.																			0270-5060					MAR	2005	20	1					165	170		10.1080/02705060.2005.9664949	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2005.9664949													WOS:000227202200020

Data from a 24 hour sampling program have revealed zooplankton to show, as a whole, a definite nocturnal migration, comparable to that previously described (CRUZ-PIZARRO, 1978, 1981; CARRILLO et al., 1989). Within the phytoplankton, non-motile and close to neutrally buoyant species (mainly Cyanarcus sp.) showed a limited daily vertical movement remaining, for most of the cycle, at the upper/intermediate layers. These species were used as a reference against which to evaluate the vertical distribution of flagellates which, despite minor specific differences, exhibited a common pattern of migration (exemplified by that of Chromulina nevadensis) involving an evening upward movement and a return downward one after dawn, both roughly coinciding with the highest values of the relative rate of change in light. Zooplankton grazing might account for much of the observed day-night differences in biomass (and density) of motile algal species. Recruitments from narrow but unsampled water layers (such as the neuston) might also contribute to explain the unrealistic computed net growth rates for C. nevadensis in the early morning. Light is probably the stimulus for the algal movement. The possibility of exploiting rich nutrient micropatchiness generated by zooplankton excretion should be able to explain its adaptive value, as other major proposed hypotheses can be discounted in this particular environment.

J	RYANZHIN, SV				RYANZHIN, SV			LATITUDINAL ALTITUDINAL INTERRELATIONSHIPS FOR THE SURFACE TEMPERATURES OF THE NORTHERN-HEMISPHERE FRESH-WATER LAKES	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Zonal relationships in (phi, Z)-space (latitude-altitude) for surface temperature of lakes in the Northern hemisphere were derived from field data for 123 freshwater lakes. Average annual and extreme temperatures were mainly considered. Nonzonal effects (lake morphometry, long-term variability, etc.) contribute to the scatter of the data about derived relationships but do not obscure them. To minimize the effects above, the initial data at Z less-than-or-equal-to 200 m first were zonally averaged. Then the averaged data were fitted by regression-models, which provided boundary values for use both in spline-models and further calculations. They give, e.g., the average southern boundary for freezing lakes and the northern boundary for mictic lakes to be phi = 53-degrees and 80-degrees respectively. The spline-models were applied to obtain improved latitudinal representations and to parameterize the altitude effects. They do not fit the data in a least-square-error sense. However, thanks to the appropriate scaling and suitable boundary conditions, their general shape is plausible. The spline-models, based upon several empirical parameters, can also be applied to any meridian strip and, after a certain modification, to the Southern hemisphere. Combination of spline-models provides a quantitative climatological-average lake thermal classification for (phi, Z)-space based on the number of full convective overturnings guaranteed in a year cycle. That includes Hutchinson and Loffler's famous scheme as a particular example. Classification provides quantitative boundaries for previously specified classes and possible new ones (cold monomictic non-freezing, moderate tetramictic lakes, etc.) which can appear or disappear in different meridian strips. Some problems of the space/time variability of lake temperatures from the models derived are also discussed. These results provide background for further physical and ecological studies.																			0304-3800					AUG	1994	74	3-4					231	253		10.1016/0304-3800(94)90121-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3800(94)90121-X													WOS:A1994PC98000005

Detritus accumulation was not significantly different between seasons or nutrient additions. Seasonal N assimilation by plants ranged from 34 to 242 kg N ha-1 for plants in the fertilized reservoir and < 0 to 104 kg N ha-1 for plants in the control reservoir.

SPATIAL PATTERN ANALYSIS OF SHOT ATTEMPTS IN BASKETBALL; THE CASE OF LA LAKERS	REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE MEDICINA Y CIENCIAS DE LA ACTIVIDAD FISICA Y DEL DEPORTE												The importance of quantitative analysis in sports using objective data (such as game statistics), has been had prominent in recent years. In this paper we have shown an application of spatial statistics to understand more thoroughly the game of basketball. This methodology has been rarely used in sports research, specifically in basketball. We have depicted how a spatial clustering technique, such as the Kulldroff test, which is widely employed in epidemiology, can be applied to analyze basketball data. This test detects low and high incidence clusters of shots, and therefore it better characterizes the game of teams and individual players. In addition, we have also used a test based on entropy, the V-test, which serves to statistically compare shooting maps. We illustrate the interesting contribution of this methodological perspective in the case of the analysis of the Lakers' performance, showing the transformation of this team from a medium-level NBA franchise into a champion team, because of, among other factors, the incorporation of two key players in the 2007-08 season: Pau Gasol and Derek Fisher.

The temperature dependence of the production rates differed among organic compounds. The seasonal change in the protein specific production rate (SPR) showed a strong temperature dependence, indicating that photoplankton growth rate was primarily governed by water temprature. In August and September, low protein SPR was, however, observed, probably due to low inorganic nitrogen concentration. Nitrogen deficiency in the late stangnation period was also suggested by high C:N ratios both in particular matter and photosynthetic productes. The glucose SPR did not show any significant correlation with water temperature, irradiance and inorganic nitrogen concentration. Highly variable glucose SPR might be due to high turnover of glucose, and vertical mixing surface layer may be one of the most important factors causing variability of glucose SPR.

Recruitment of P. homoion started earlier in the warmer lake. A temporal shift of the life-cycle was thus observed but there were no differences between the total prevalence or the total relative density of the parasite in the two areas. Since there is no evidence of parasite-induced host mortality, or for the development of protective immunity, the main regulatory process in the heated area are most likely an increased mortality due to reduced thermal tolerance of the adult parasite.

The temperature and salinity profiles tan both be either stabilizing or destabilizing, depending on the regime and the season; if salinity is destabilizing, and double-diffusive processes are attained, the two water bodies mix at a much faster rate than normal turbulent diffusion can account for.

This species shows a nocturnal vertical migration and a simultaneous diel horizontal movement. In the present study, a detailed 24-h sampling program was carried out at four depths in six stations located along the two main transects of lake La Caldera. The results show the existence of diel cycles in oviposition of amictic and mictic (male and resting) eggs of this rotifer. The egg ratio for amictic and mictic eggs increases during the night. The oviposition of amictic eggs was also higher in the pelagic zone of the lake. Oviposition of amictic and mictic eggs was not related with density of H. bulgarica nor with density of competitors (Mixodiaptomus laciniatus). Our results suggest that UV radiation or an endogenous circadian rhythm of activity could be responsible of the diel cycle in oviposition of H. bulgarica.

Sir Lanka experiences two monsoons dividing the year into four meteorological seasons: - the North East (October-December) and South West (April-June) monsoons and the two inter-monsoons. A significant log linear relationship was found between Secchi disc depth and the depth of the euphotic zone which was lowest during the NE monsoon. Maximum mean photosynthetic rate ranged from 0.935 .+-. 0.067 SE to 0.479 mg O21-1 h-1 .+-. 0.115. Gross primary productivity which ranged from 0.378 g O2 m-2 h-1 in the NE monsoon to 0.980 g O2 m-2 h-1 in the SW monsoon showed significant season variation. This is shown to be determined either directly or indirectly by the light regime.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUL 20	1987	150	2					165	175		10.1007/BF00006664	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00006664													WOS:A1987J183600008

For a period of 10 years (1979-1989), the northern end of the lake received a total of 50.000 m(3)d(-1) of bauxite tailings. As a consequence spelling aproximately 30% of its sediments are covered by tailings. The principal goal of this research was to estimate rates of nitrogen fixation in the impacted and non-impacted sediment in the different hydroperiods that occur in this ecosystem (drawdown, drying, filling and flooding). Nitrogen fixation was estimated using the acetylene reduction method. The highest rates of nitrogen fixation were observed to occur during the drying period and appear to be directly related to an increase in primary production by phytoplankton. Decreased rates of nitrogen fixation occurred during the hydroperiods of filling, flooding and drawdown with the greatest reductions occuring in the impacted area of the lake. In the impacted area of the lake, bauxite tailings have reduced primary production in the water column, decreased labile authoctonous carbon availability to hererotrophic bacteria in the sediments, and decreased nitrogen Fixing activity of organisms present the sediments.

Chick diets consisted mainly of Alburnus spp. Prey length consumed by chicks, feeding frequencies and the distribution of meals delivered to chicks during the day varied throughout the rearing period. The investigation of the foraging sites revealed for the first time the utilization of Lakes Mikri and Megali Prespa, confirmed the regular use of the neighboring Lakes Chimaditis and Kastorias, proved the use of the Axios Delta (149 km for the colony) and provides evidence for the use of Lake Kerkini (182.5 km distance). The impact of Great White Pelicans on commercial fisheries of Mikri Prespa was slight; only 4% of the annual fish yield, while negligible for Lake Megali Prespa. A temporal pattern in the exploitation of the above mentioned sites was observed during the breeding season. Some conservation measures are recommended.																			0738-6028						1996	19				1		190	206		10.2307/1521963	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1521963													WOS:A1996VL28700025

Macroinvertebrate and rotifer biomonitoring (based on the global and Belgian biotic index and on the Sladecek index respectively) were used as bioindicators. These biotic indices were related to the main physical and chemical parameters monitored between the source and the town of Malmedy (i.e., a river length of 40 km). Important seasonal and longitudinal changes of physical, chemical and biological water quality occur. The deterioration of the water quality in the river Warche is obvious in two sectors of the river. Strong organic pollution and eutrophication were observed between the source and the sampling station located downstream of Bullingen. Indeed, along this sector, tributaries, sewage and dairy effluent flow into the Warche and induce significant increase of nitrate, nitrite, ammonium and phosphate concentrations. As a consequence, biotic indices decrease significantly downstream of Bullingen and the most abundant rotifer species are clearly eutrophic indicators. Another important decrease of water quality was observed downstream of an important paper mill effluent which induces a significant increase of temperature and of nitrite and sulphate concentrations. The presence of two lakes along the Warche course induces downstream either a restoration of the water quality during a mixing period of the lake or an increase of ammonium and phosphate concentrations after water stratification as a result of a temperature gradient in the lake.																			0028-2960						1996	46	3-4					337	350																WOS:A1996VY82800017
J	EGGERS, DM				EGGERS, DM			LIMNETIC FEEDING-BEHAVIOR OF JUVENILE SOCKEYE SALMON IN LAKE WASHINGTON AND PREDATOR AVOIDANCE	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Patterns of limnetic feeding behavior (vertical movement, schooling, diel feeding chronology, zooplankton prey selectivity) of Lake Washington [Washington, USA] juvenile sockeye salmon [Oncorhynchus nerka] are described. A general hypothesis to explain the relative fitness of alternative behavioral decisions is presented. The limnetic feeding behavior of the salmon appears to minimize their vulnerability to predation by the visual piscivore, northern squawfish [Ptychocheilus oregonensis]. Seasonal variation indicates that sockeye feeding behavior is a short term optimization process involving foraging success and encounters with northern squawfish. Lake Washington sockeye salmon can afford to spend a large amount of their time engaged in antipredator behavior at the expense of foraging success because Lake Washington is comparatively zooplankton-rich and the energy demands of the fish can be met in short foraging periods. Sockeye in other less productive systems show a more aggressive exploitation of the zooplankton.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1978	23	6					1114	1125		10.4319/lo.1978.23.6.1114	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1978.23.6.1114													WOS:A1978GC21100003
J	RIPPEY, B				RIPPEY, B			A LABORATORY STUDY OF THE SILICON RELEASE PROCESS FROM A LAKE SEDIMENT (LOUGH NEAGH, NORTHERN-IRELAND)	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The source and mechanism of release of silicon from the sediments of eutrophic Lough Neagh, Northern Ireland were investigated in the laboratory using undisturbed sediment cores. From the variation of measured release rate with pH, temperature and season the sediment release process was inferred. The sediment Si release rate is determined mainly by temperature. Other influences are pH and the time since a sedimentary input of biogenic silica. The increase of release rate with pH above pH 7.4 indicates that biogenic silica is the source of the sediment release and the activation energy of the release process indicates that the dissolution reaction is rate limiting in the laboratory. The linear concentration-time behavior observed in the cores suggests that the pore water concentration-depth shape is concave upwards. This disturbed sediment-water interface may be due to water currents and turbulence and/or irrigation of the upper sediment layers by benthic organisms.																			0003-9136						1983	96	4					417	433																WOS:A1983QQ32400002

Middle Holocene hydrologic change and hypolimnion formation in Lake Erie	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Data from a nearshore sediment core and a deep-water sediment core from the central basin of Lake Erie reveal shifts in sediment properties and stable isotope composition of shell carbonate between ca. 4,600 and 3,500 C-14 yrs BP. Radiocarbon dates are corrected for the hardwater effect by subtracting 670 years based on a modem calibration for the central basin. Silt content increased in the deep water core at 4,600 and again, slightly, at 3,900 C-14 yrs BP. Sand size increased in the nearshore core at 3,500 C-14 yrs BP. delta O-18 of shell carbonate increased and delta C-13 decreased in both cores between about 4,200 and 3,500 C-14 years BP. Magnetic susceptibility and percent calcite decreased sharply and percent organic carbon increased slightly in the deep water core beginning at 4,000 C-14 yrs BP. Most of the changes in sediment properties and stable isotope composition of shell carbonate occurred between 4,200 and 3,900 C-14 yrs BP. They coincide in time with the Nipissing II highstand of Lake Nipissing, in the Huron and Michigan basins, and with evidence for higher-than-present lake levels in Lake Erie. The changes in proxy data are interpreted as evidence for an influx of surface water as drainage from the Upper Great Lakes was rerouted through Lake Erie. There is little evidence in the sediment proxy record for changes in Lake Erie during the earlier Nipissing I highstand or the middle Holocene transition in regional climate. A 9,000-year composite stable isotope record for the central basin shows that the sediment cores document a transformation in drainage that established the modern hydrologic system for the lake. High lake level induced a seasonal hypolimnion, setting the stage for the low pH, oxygen-depleted bottom waters of today.

The colony is located on an island on a small (4.6 ha area) artificial lake situated in the most abundantly visited recreational area of Bydgoszcz (53 degrees 07'N, 18 degrees 03'E). The island has an area of 0.9 ha and in some parts there are 25-30 year old Pinus silvestris; the banks are overgrown by Phragmites communis, Typha latifolia and Salix sp., and the remaining part of the island is covered by grasses and perennial pants. During seven breeding seasons remarkable fluctuations in colony size were noted (from 1877 pairs in 2000 to 998 pairs in 2003). Most, i.e. 71% of females started breeding between the 15(th) and 25(th) of April. In subsequent seasons they laid 2.2-2.8 eggs (mean 2.5 eggs). Egg losses during incubation varied between 9.7% and 17.6% (mean 13.7%). Mortality of chicks during the first three weeks of life was at an average level of 15.2% and varied in subsequent seasons from 5.6% to 29.4%. In consequence, breeding success of the studied population was at a level of 72.6%, and each pair raised on average 1.81 offspring. The collected data on numbers, phenology, dynamics of broods and selected parameters of reproduction (i.e. size of broods, egg losses and chick mortality) indicate that in the studied population - despite its specific location and several years of existence - there arc no changes that would give evidence to the progressing process of synurbisation.

The species in British Columbia. is designated "Endangered" and it is also included on the provincial "Red List." As such, the Stum Lake colony has been monitored regularly since 1994, and older records of nest counts and pre-fledgling numbers date back as far as 1953. A marking program for pre-fledging American White Pelicans was conducted from 1968 to 1993. During recent surveys, censuses of nest depressions were obtained late in the breeding season; pre-fledged young were also enumerated. Based on nest counts, numbers at Stum Lake declined in the 1960s and remained more or less stationary throughout the 1970s and early 1980s. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the number of nesting pairs increased dramatically; and in the past decade, numbers of breeding birds at Stum Lake has stabilized at the highest since monitoring began (1953). The mean number of pre-fledged young also shows an increasing trend from 1963 through 2002. The mean productivity at the breeding colony, however, was highest in the decade showing the largest growth, from 1983 to 1992; but it decreased in the past decade as total numbers of breeding birds continued to increase. The mean productivity of the breeding colony since monitoring began has been 0.62 +/- 0.37 young nest(-1), with annual rates varying from nil to 1.48 young nest per nest. Four breeding failures have been documented since 1960. The majority of the returns from the marking program were from west of the Continental Divide in British Columbia, Washington, California, Oregon, Idaho and Mexico.																			1524-4695	1938-5390					2005	28				1		18	22		10.1675/1524-4695(2005)28[18:FYOAWP]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1675/1524-4695(2005)28[18:FYOAWP]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000232808400004
J	Watson, SB; McCauley, E				Watson, SB; McCauley, E			Ammonia and nitrate: growth or inhibition? Large- and small-scale patterns in chrysophytes and the potential role of inorganic nitrogen	NOVA HEDWIGIA					6th International Chrysophyte Symposium	AUG 02-07, 2004	Univ Helsinki, Lammi, FINLAND		Univ Helsinki			Although a number of studies have concluded that dissolved the chemistry and supply of inorganic N (DIN, as NH4 and NO3) influence algal community composition and biomass, this relationship has not been well characterized in freshwater systems. At moderate nutrient supply, it is known that most algal phototrophs assimilate NH4 more readily than NO3, but the potential inhibitory effects of high ammonia levels that are typical, for example, of anoxic or hypereutrophic systems, are unknown. In this paper we examined in the relationship between DIN supply and phytoplankton community structure and biomass, with focus on chrysophytes. We tested the hypothesis that two opposite mechanisms modify chrysophyte abundance and distribution in freshwater systems: i) taxon-specific differences in growth at moderate levels of NH4 and/or NO3, and ii) inhibition at high NH4 levels. First, we analyzed seasonal average data from the literature from lakes covering a range of TP (6-452 mu g.L-1), and investigated the relationships between nutrients (N, P) and the biomass of six major taxonomic groups. The data were derived from studies which grouped Chrysophyceae, Synurophyceae and Prymnesiophyta as Chrysophyta, and diatoms separately as Bacillariophyta. Statistical analyses confirmed a highly significant increase in the levels and proportion of NH4/DIN with eutrophy (P < 0.0001). But of six taxonomic groups, only chrysophytes showed a significant relationship with DIN; specifically, a negative correlation with NH4 (P < 0.0001). Mixing regime had no statistically significant effect. Second, we compared in vitro growth of three common bloom-forming chrysophytes Uroglena americana Calkins, Dinobryon cylindricum Imhof and Synura petersenii Korshikov, over an NH4 treatment range of similar to 0-1400 mu M. None of the species showed statistically significant inhibition, although Uroglena growth and final biomass were highly variable and generally reduced at 1400 mu M-NH4. In a second series of experiments we examined growth and final cell yield of the two bactivorous chrysophytes Uroglena and Dinobryon at moderate levels of NH4, NO3 or combined [NH4 + NO3]. Both species showed the most rapid growth in all treatments with NH4, but achieved the highest final abundance with combined NH4 and NO3. We concluded that in most natural freshwaters, ammonia inhibition is unlikely to account for the general absence of chrysophytes from eutrophic systems, and furthermore that at low-moderate nutrient levels, DIN chemistry may have an important influence on both the their abundance and species composition.																			0029-5035	2363-7188					2005				128			231	247																WOS:000235193900015
J	PINTOCOELHO, RM				PINTOCOELHO, RM			THE IMPORTANCE OF DAPHNIA FOR ZOOPLANKTON GRAZING IN LAKE CONSTANCE	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The seasonal variation of zooplankton community grazing rates in pelagial of Lake Constance was examined in situ. Two size fractions were considered: P1 > 170-mu-m (mesozooplankton) and 50 < P2 < 170-mu-m (microzooplankton). As expected, the grazing rates were highest when daphnid biomass values reached their seasonal maximum (clear-water phase). Care was taken to include diel variations of grazing rates in the seasonal model. Comparison of grazing rates of Daphnia populations (PGR) and community grazing rates (CGR) as well as multiple regression analysis were applied to evaluate the contribution of these herbivores to the overall zooplankton grazing. The filtering rates of both Daphnia populations (PGR) controlled the basic seasonal trends as well as the magnitude of mesozooplankton grazing. Among the selected variables, the biomass of D. hyalina explained the highest amount of total variability of community grazing. The coupling effect between zooplankton vertical migration and diel fluctuations of grazing rates was investigated by means of the biomass specific community grazing rates. It was shown that higher epilimnetic community grazing rates at night are mostly due to biomass concentration and not to enhanced specific filtering rates. Finally, the effect of temperature and food concentration on the filtering rates of Daphnia were also examined. Filtering rates of D. hyalina were significantly affected by low temperatures in hypolimnion and by particulate organic carbon in epilimnion of L. Constance.																			0003-9136					MAY	1991	121	3					319	342																WOS:A1991FW59000005

There were 299 separate contacts with the implanted walleye during 454 hours of tracking. On a seasonal basis, the number of contacts recorded was proportionate to the tracking effort expended per season. However, the difference between the number of contacts recorded per diel period and the number expected based on hours of tracking per period was significant (P < 0.001). More individuals were actively swimming when contacted during crepuscular and nocturnal hours than during the day. Behaviors exhibited by the implanted walleye were holding station, meandering swimming and cruise swimming. There females and one male established separate home ranges, and each used the same home range during 1987 and 1988. The remaining individuals tended to be nomadic. Except during the spawning seson, there was no evidence that the walleye tended to use specific areas of the lake at different times of the year.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				DEC	1989	5	2					177	185		10.1080/02705060.1989.9665227	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1989.9665227													WOS:A1989CJ56300008

Statistical studies have revealed that the most significant assemblage is characterized by Florilus labrodoricum and F. grateloupi (av. 25.14%). Foraminiferal variation throws light on water mass characters such as salinity, water depth and the bottom sediments.																			0016-7622					SEP	2000	56	3					331	339																WOS:000089167000010

The abundance of these strands decreased from 1984 to 1986, whereas their modal size increased. These trends were used to estimate the decreasing abundance of the 1982 cohort and its increasing age. According to these data, total mortality within the 1982 cohort was 99% between the egg stage and 2 years, 78% between 2 and 3 years, 82% between 3 and 4 years.																				1095-8649				NOV	1987	31	5					715	720		10.1111/j.1095-8649.1987.tb05274.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8649.1987.tb05274.x													WOS:A1987K749100012

Data are presented on the qualitative and quantitative composition of the chironomid fauna in the profundal of Starnberger See, on the spatial variation, and on the phenology of the dominant species, based on pupal occurrence and the seasonal distribution of larval instars. Twenty-five distinct chironomid taxa could be recorded in the profundal zone. Typical inhabitants of the profundal zone of Starnberger See are the larvae of the genus Microspectra. The maximum abundance of Microspectra larvae were found at 60 m with 5644 Ind.m-2. Abundance, distribution and phenology of the dominant chironomid species are discussed in comparison with other lakes.

Pb, Zn, Ni, Cu and Cr discharges from domestic and industrial activities have resulted in concentration increases of 2-16 X above background levels, depending on the metal, as well as an increase of 13-27% of the labile fraction (% LF). No apparent effect on the metals' grain-size distribution was observed. Evidence suggests that chemical reactions, coupled with transport of sediments from the mountainous areas to lowland areas, produce: (1) an increase in metal concentration and % LF, which are concomitant with the pollution effect; and (2) a metals' grain-size redistribution toward fine fractions. Analysis of major elements, i.e. Na, K, Mg, Ca, Al and Fe, provides a suitable approach to discriminate the two effects mentioned above. The wet-dry season variability in metal concentration appeared to be controlled mainly by the input of flushed material from soil. This process can explain the large areal variability of concentrations compared with sampling and analytical variability. A physical dilution of Zn with less contaminated, flushed soil material was also observed.																			0009-2541					MAY 5	1994	114	1-2					69	82		10.1016/0009-2541(94)90042-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0009-2541(94)90042-6													WOS:A1994NJ54900005

The heavy isotopes of H, 2H (stable) and 3H (radioactive), forming part of the water molecule, are the most conservative tracers of water known. 18O circulates in tandem with 2H in the hydrologic cycle. 3H fallout varies seasonally and annually in a systematic fashion, and due to its property of radioactive decay is highly useful for dating time of recharge of soil moisture and ground-water. 14C is valuable for tracing old groundwater owing to its relatively long half-life of 5568 yr, but detailed knowledge of the hydrochemistry of the system is required for successful modeling. 2H and 18O are of principal value because they reflect the temperature at which precipitation condensed. They show pronounced seasonal variability and also the effects of altitude, latitude, distance from the sea, amount of precipitation, history of evaporation and long-period climatic cycles. Principal areas of application of environmental isotopes to hydrologic modeling were in soil-moisture transport, modeling of mixing and evapotranspiration in large lakes and swamps, glacial-ice movement, groundwater flow, and transport of contaminants in groundwater.																			0022-1694	1879-2707					1984	68	1-4					95	113		10.1016/0022-1694(84)90206-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-1694(84)90206-3													WOS:A1984RV28200009

DISTRIBUTION OF PHOTOSYNTHETIC MICROORGANISMS AND PRIMARY PRODUCTION	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The seasonal and vertical distributions of sulfur photosynthetic bacteria and cyanobacteria in Solar Lake, and their contribution to primary production, are described. During stratification, separate plates of the phototrophic sulfur bacteria Chromatium violescens and Prosthecochloris sp. develop. A bottom cyanobacterial bloom consisting of Oscillatoria spp. and Microcoleus sp. develops in H2S concentrations up to 39 ppm and light conditions down to 0.5% of surface light. The occurrence of a cyanobacterial blood in the hypolimnion is explained by the facultative anoxygenic photosynthesis of O. limnetica. Primary production is extremely high during stratification and reaches a maximum of 8015 mg C m-2 day-1, 91% of which is produced in the metalimnion and hypolimnion. The overall annual production (59.09 g C m-2 yr-1) is low, owing to extremely low primary production in the epilimnion throughout stratification and in the whole column during holomixis. Stagnant conditions in a shallow body of water exposed to high irradiation leads to an inverse productivity profile.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1977	22	4					609	620		10.4319/lo.1977.22.4.0609	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1977.22.4.0609													WOS:A1977DP82500003

Hydrilla coverage was altered with aquatic herbicides and grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) during the study period in both lakes. Bluegill and redear sunfish condition was not adversely affected untial hydrilla occupied the majority of the water column. The reduction in condition which occurred with near total occupation of the water column by hydrilla was probably due to the elimination of a foraging gradient between the submersed macrophytes and open water.

J	SABAT, AM				SABAT, AM			MATING SUCCESS IN BROOD-GUARDING MALE ROCK BASS, AMBLOPLITES-RUPESTRIS - THE EFFECT OF BODY-SIZE	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												The hypothesis that variation in a paternal trait associated with offspring survival will result in female mate choice based on that trait was tested in rock bass, Ambloplites rupestris, a temperate fresh water fish with uniparental male care. The number of eggs acquired by 108 nesting male rock bass, in Cranberry Lake (New York State, US.A.), was estimated in two different spawning episodes that differed in the size structure of the nesting male stock. Early breeders (between the 4-7 June 1989) were mainly medium and large males (101-300 g), as compared to late breeders (between the 19-21 June 1989) which were mostly small (50-100 g). Because survival of larvae in rock bass is significantly lower in nests guarded by small males as compared to nests guarded by medium and large males, it was hypothesized that female mate choice should have been (1) size-based, and (2) more intense late in the season when the nesting stock was comprised mostly of small males. The results were consistent with these hypotheses. Variation in egg numbers per nest was significantly higher during the late spawning episode. In addition, egg number per nest were normally distributed during the early spawning episode, but were positively skewed and leptokurtic during the later episode. The correlation between male size and egg number was significant for both spawning episodes. However, during the late episode male size explained 23% of the variation in egg numbers versus only 8% of the variation during the earlier episode.																			0378-1909					APR	1994	39	4					411	415		10.1007/BF00004810	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00004810													WOS:A1994NE00600009
J	PERSSON, L; JOHANSSON, L				PERSSON, L; JOHANSSON, L			ON COMPETITION AND TEMPORAL VARIATION IN TEMPERATE FRESH-WATER FISH POPULATIONS	NETHERLANDS JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Recruitment in fish populations is characterized by a high temporal variability and a considerable stochasticity. It has therefore been suggested that fish populations should be likely candidates for coexistence based on the storage mechanism. Many characteristics of fish populations such as high variability in year class strength and mortality biased towards smaller (younger) individuals are also elements that make coexistence based on the storage mechanism likely. At the same time, considerable experimental evidence usually associated with deterministic competition models, such as density dependence in individual growth rates, density dependence in populations densities, and competition-related niche dynamics, is also present. We use temporal variation in temperature, an environmental variable involving both a stochastic and a regular (seasonal) component, to illustrate how both coexistence based on a storage mechanism and patterns expected from deterministic competition models may co-occur. Temperature is as important in fish as in other poikilothermic organisms, since the carrying capacity of the population will vary with temperature through the latter's effect on the metabolic requirements of individuals. Seasonal variation in temperature will, through its effect on metabolic demands, also cause favourable periods to alternate with unfavourable periods, i.e. environmental effects covary with competition effects as assumed in lottery models. We suggest that seasonal variation in temperature will promote coexistence and at the same time allow competition to be a regular event with significant evolutionary potential. Experimental and field evidence that supports the idea of a seasonal variation in resourse limitation strongly coupled to temperature is provided.

Differences in annual temperature, length of the stratification period (low oxygen content) and bottom sediment characteristics influence the population of P. a. paravanicus in different depth zones of Lake Sevan. From shallow to deep water a regular increase of the following indices was observed in 1984-1987: annual biomass from 1.2-2.0 to 8.2-17.0 g m-2 wet weight; mean individual wet weight.of clitellate specimens from 2.0-3.8 to 8.3-16.6 mg; total life span from one and a half to more than 20 years; the length of breeding season from 2-3 to 12 months. An important ecological distinction between P. a. paravanicus and allied Potamothrix hammoniensis (Michaelsen) is the much lower fecundity of the former species.																			0018-8158					MAR 25	1994	278	1-3					281	286		10.1007/BF00142336	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00142336													WOS:A1994NE00500032

The average values of productions per vegetation period for the investigation years were as follows: phytoplanktion - 203.5 gC . m-2; bacterioplankton - 37.9 gC . m-2; filter-feeding zooplankton - 20.6 gC . m-2 and predatory zooplankton - 1.5 gC . m-2. The herbivorous zooplankton production constituted 10.1 % of primary production. This ratio indicates a direct relationship between zoo- and phytoplankton in the food chain - filtrators are feeding mostly on living algae and the detrital food chain seems of little importance. The dominance of large forms (Melosira sp., Aphanothece saxicola), in the phytoplankton during the major part of the vegetation period is assumed to be a result of high grazing pressure on small algae. Zooplankton grazing was investigated in situ in a specially constructed twin bathometer. Experimental measurements revealed, that zooplanktion presence in the experimental vessel actually stimulated the phytoplankton growth in many cases - the negative grazing values have been registered. That could be caused by the stimulation effect of nutrients (N, P), excreted by the concentrated zooplankton in the grazing chamber, which led to an increase of the nongrazed phytoplankton production. Bacteria have satisfied the zooplankton food requirements on average by 11 %. Grazing on bacteria increased, when grazing on phytoplankton was somehow disturbed.

J	STEWART, KM; SUTHERLAND, JW				STEWART, KM; SUTHERLAND, JW			ZOOPLANKTON MIGRATION IN 3 LAKES OF WESTERN NEW-YORK	INTERNATIONALE REVUE DER GESAMTEN HYDROBIOLOGIE												We examined the diel vertical migration (DVM) of zooplankton in three lakes of western New York; Lakes Conesus, Lime, and McCargo. In all three lakes, the dipteran predator Chaoborus was a more dramatic migrator than any of the cladocerans or copepods. In contrast, another invertebrate predator, Leptodora, seemed to have the least vertical dispersal. In Conesus Lake, following the evening ascent and upper-water night-positioning of Chaoborus flavicans, Daphnia pulicaria expanded its own vertical range of dispersal thereby decreasing its degree of overlap with Chaoborus. The vertical distribution of Diaptomus sicilis was mostly below that of Daphnia pulicaria, thus reducing possible competition for food resources. Poor oxygen conditions in the lower waters of Lakes Lime and McCargo restricted all zooplankton (except Chaoborus) to an epilimnetic zone where the regions of niche overlap and predation were narrowed. Such annually-induced restrictions on vertical dispersal are probably common features of numerous stratified lakes with hypolimnetic reducing conditions. No fixed pattern of vertical dispersal or migration is likely in lakes where stratification and non-stratification follow each other seasonally. Vertical migration does provide some flexibility in niche separation, but the potential for chaotic behavior in interacting predators and prey may confound simple explanations of DVM.																			0020-9309						1993	78	1					21	37		10.1002/iroh.19930780104	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19930780104													WOS:A1993LR15800002

However, there are few studies on their composition and diversity in lake sediments. Here, we used denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and clone libraries of partial 16S rRNA gene to study the spatial variations of actinobacterial communities across 4 seasons in the surface sediments of the shallow, subtropical Taihu Lake. Cluster analysis based on fingerprints showed clear spatiotemporal variations of actinobacterial communities and higher seasonal variation than spatial heterogeneity. Based on clone libraries, this pattern was supported by the principal coordinates analysis in the phylogenetic context and by detrended correspondence analysis on the operational taxonomic unit table. Additionally, phylogenetic analysis showed that the putative freshwater-specific actinobacterial lineages (e. g., acI) were also detected in the lake sediments, which suggests that these subclusters may also adapt to the sediment environments. Summarily, our results suggested that actinobacterial communities of the surface sediments were more affected by seasonal variation than spatial heterogeneity in the intrahabitat of Taihu Lake.

Invertebrates appeared to be an important food of lake trout < 200 mm long but were only occasionally eaten by larger fish. For all seasons and size groups of juvenile lake trout combined, the slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus) was the principal forage fish, making up 42% (by weight) of identifiable fish remains. Young-of-the-year slimy sculpins were a major food of recently stocked yearling lake trout during July-Oct.

Various mathematical equations were fitted to these photosynthesis-light curves and were evaluated in terms of averaged squared residuals and the number of times the equation gave a best fit to the empirical data. A generalized hyperbolic inhibition equation with 4 parameters was proposed because of better fit to the observed 60 curves with photoinhibition. For describing light saturation this equation reduces to a generalized hyperbolic saturation equation by eliminating a parameter for photoinhibition. These 2 hyperbolic equations can be used as standards for comparing the values of parameters estimated by other equations. For practical use, the 1st equation may be simplified. A procedure for fitting these equations to the observed photosynthesis-light curve was described. The values of respective parameters estimated by various equations were compared. Variability of the primary production calculated by different saturation equations were examined.																			0003-9136						1983	97	2					208	226																WOS:A1983QW34300005

Data were collected on abiotic factors, primary production, biomass and phytoplankton losses and subjected to reduction by means of several principal component analyses. Furthermore, weekly data on the same variables were gathered from published studies on Uberlinger See, an embayment of the much deeper, mesotrophic Lake Constance (Central Europe), and treated in the same way. The two first principal components of PCAs on biological variables explained more than 60% of overall variance in both lakes. They could be ascribed to phytoplankton production + biomass and photosynthetic physiology + phytoplankton losses, respectively. The ordination of the biological trajectories in the data space of the two first principal components revealed six stable states of phytoplankton biomass in the shallow lake and seven in the deep lake. The breakpoints between stable states could be due to environmental, abiotic variables in some cases but biological interactions were suspected to be the cause of the other breakpoints. The abiotic effects on phytoplankton biomass took longer to occur in the deep lake. Also, short-term dynamics (one-three weeks) were demonstrated for both phytoplankton communities. A preliminary comparison between phytoplankton biomass dynamics in stratifying, shallow and deep lakes suggests that differences may be attributed partly to differences in depth.

Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed no significant differences between stations nor sexes in 90% of the population parameters. A general reduction in asymptotic length (L(infinity)) of R. argentea was realized in the Winam Gulf while the stock is currently overexploited. Dagaa fishery in the Winam Gulf of Lake Victoria is commercially important as a source of poultry feed, fish feed, cattle feed and human food. Rational exploitation of this fishery could be possibly achieved through correct management policies including the fisheries cooperative societies, licencing of nets in addition to registration of boats and strict observation of closed seasons.

J	KANTRUD, HA				KANTRUD, HA			GRAZING INTENSITY EFFECTS ON THE BREEDING AVIFAUNA OF NORTH-DAKOTA NATIVE GRASSLANDS	CANADIAN FIELD-NATURALIST												A breeding bird census and plant survey was conducted on 180 samples of lightly, moderately and heavily grazed and hayed native grasslands in North Dakota in 1974. The 10 most important cover plants on each of 8 major physiographic landforms in 3 of the 4 regions (the Agassiz Lake Plain excluded) overlapped so extensively that only 19 spp. were involved: 13 grasses or sedges, 4 forbs, 1 shrub and 1 clubmoss. Bird densities were generally highest in regions and landforms containing numerous natural basin wetlands; flatter, glaciated landforms containing more fertile soils; and landforms of greater relief and high habitat heterogeneity. Avian species richness tended to decrease with increased grazing intensity, but total bird density increased due to higher populations of a few species, and hayland that had been mowed and raked during the previous growing season was highly attractive to some species.																			0008-3550						1981	95	4					404	417																WOS:A1981NL91600001

SEASONAL-CHANGES IN HEAVY-METAL CONTENT OF ABOVE-GROUND BIOMASS AND DECOMPOSING LEAVES OF PHRAGMITES-AUSTRALIS (CAV) TRIN	AQUATIC BOTANY												The seasonal changes in heavy metal content of the aboveground biomass and decomposing leaves of P. australis (Cav.) Trin. from the littoral zone of the eutrophic, sewage-polluted Lake Sorteso and the oligotrophic, non-polluted Lake Hampen, were investigated. The concentration of Zn in the leaves and stems and of Cu in stems is at a maximum during the growth season and decreases thereafter. The concentration of Cu in the leaves was more or less constant during the study period. The concentration of Pb in the leaves increased during the after the growth season, possibly as a result of atmospheric deposition. Leaves decompose .apprx. 3-7 times faster than the stems. Stems decayed significantly faster in Lake Sorteso than in Lake Hampen, whereas decomposition of leaves was only significantly faster in Sorteso during the first 6 mo. of the study period. Concentrations of Zn, Pb and Cd increased significantly in Phragmites leaves during decomposition. The actual contents of Zn and Cu were either relatively constant or decreased, whereas those of Pb and Cd increased. A simplified model showing the cycling of heavy metals in the littoral zone of the 2 lakes indicates that Lake Hampen is more sensitive to pollution with heavy metals than Lake Sorteso.																			0304-3770	1879-1522					1981	11	3					211	230		10.1016/0304-3770(81)90062-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(81)90062-0													WOS:A1981MM88700002

A list of taxa was developed for 1981 and 1982, with taxonomic additions for 1983-1985 and comments on community structure, seasonal and elevational changes in species abundance, and noteworthy occurrences. a total of 111 taxa was collected, of which 84% occurred in streams, 58% being exclusively lotic. Dipterans composed 73-81% of total abundance in streams. The littoral benthic zone of lakes was predominantly trichopterans and dipterans, 44-60% and 24-39%, respectively. Numerically important organisms in various lakes and streams were chironomids, simuliids (particularly Metacnephia), oligochaetes, and the bivalve Pisidium casertanum. An isolated lake and its outlet stream, with unique characteristics, were the sole locations of Gammarus lacustris (Amphipoda) and Glossiphonia complanata (Hirudinea). Manipulated lowering of a lake along the main drainage exposed abundant and luxuriant colonies of the bryozoan Fredericella sultana. This organism was found on 43% of all rocks sampled, a preponderance heretofore unknown for this, or any, ectoproct in alpine or arctic lakes.																			0017-3614					JUL 31	1987	47	3					500	511																WOS:A1987L040700014

J	Nost, T; Jensen, JW				Nost, T; Jensen, JW			Crustacean plankton in Hoylandet	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Crustacean plankton was studied in 12 lakes in the Hoylandet area in 1986-87. Basic lake characteristics are elevation 134-415 m, surface area 9-530 ha, pH 5.9-7.1, conductivity (25 degrees C) 12-40 mu S cm(-1) and Secchi depth 4-9 m. Number of species present varied between 3 and 11. Population numbers between 4000 and 400 000 per m(2) and biomasses were within the range 30 to 1800 mg m(-2) dry weight. Cladocera dominated over Copepoda in lakes with allopatric brown trout (Salmo trutta L.), on the contrary to lakes also populated by Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus (L.)). These variations are caused by differences in elevation, lake morphometry, water quality, fish predation and the general distribution of the species. The largest lakes at lowest elevation were richest in species. The acid sensitive genus Daphnia was represented by 3 species. The lakes Storgronningen (530 ha) and Royrtjonnna (27 ha) were sampled monthly in the ice-free seasons of 1986-89, and Storgronningen more intensively from June to November in 1987 and 1988. The same 6 species of Cladocera and 5 of Copepoda were present in both lakes. Their life cycles were traditional or known from several other Scandinavian lakes. Mean seasonal biomasses were of the range 600-750 mg m(-2). At the species level, there were considerable variations between years in Storgronningen and particularly in Royrtjonna. No effects of human impacts on the crustacean plankton were found. The Hoylandet lakes are representative for Scandinavian oligotrophic to almost ultra-oligotrophic lakes. Storgronningen is well qualified as a reference system. The between year variations in Royrtjonna are so extreme, that any human impact could only be traced at a level causing the extinction of species.																			0018-8158					AUG 1	1997	348						95	111		10.1023/A:1003089201611	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003089201611													WOS:A1997XV67900008
J	Rubim, P				Rubim, Paulo			Seasonality in an assemblage of waterbirds in a marginal lake of the Mogi Guacu River, Sao Paulo state, Brazil	REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ORNITOLOGIA												I analyzed the seasonality of a non-passerine waterbird assemblage in a marginal lake of the Mogi Guacu River during monthly visits from March 2003 to February 2004. I found a total of 15 species belonging to eight families. Ardeidae (five species) and Anatidae (four) were the families with the highest number of species. There was no significant variation in the number of species between the rainy and dry seasons. However, the number of recorded individuals approximately doubled during the rainy season. There was high rate of temporal succession among species throughout the year, because more than half of the species were recorded only once during the year. Vanellus chilensis (Molina, 1782) and Amazonetta brasiliensis (Gmelin, 1789) were the commonest species, but they were not considered residents. Apparently the occurrence of waterbirds at the study sites may be primarily related to their foraging strategies, so I suggest that for any individual species there are periods of higher probability of occurrence according to both its foraging strategy and the local climate seasonality.																			0103-5657					MAR	2013	21	1					10	15																WOS:000321053900003

Monsoon season of the first phase (July to August, 2006) of study documented relatively the maximum precipitation across the wetland with values ranging from 311.2 to 903.9 Lm(-2) in July and August, respectively. On the other hand precipitation across the wetland during the monsoon season of second phase (July to August, 2007) of study varied from 206.6 to 415.8 Lm(-2) with relatively minimum and maximum values obtained in August and July, respectively. The rain water remained alkaline throughout the study period. Calcium carbonate documented the maximum monsoon precipitation mediated atmospheric deposition of 2.82 x 10(3) to 6.76 x 10(3) g (first phase of study) and 1.93 x 10(3) to 3.06 x 10(3) g (second phase of study) across one square meter surface water area of wetland. Among ionic particulate substances calcium documented relatively maximum wet deposition across wetland unit surface water area with estimated values ranging from 1.85 x 10(3) to 5.37 x 10(3) g and 1.33 x 10(3) to 2.7 x 10(3) g during first and second phase of study, respectively. On the other hand phosphate phosphorus recorded relatively minimum wet deposition flux across wetland unit surface water area with estimated values ranging from 0.019 x 10(3) to 0.054 x 10(3) g and 0.012 x 10(3) to 0.025 x 10(3) g during first and second phase of study, respectively. A measurable variation within season in the observed chemical substances of limnological importance in rain water and in their precipitation mediated influx across the wetland surface can be linked to natural changes in the surrounding environment influenced with some interventions from anthropogenic activities.																			0369-8211	2250-1746				MAR	2013	83	1					81	90		10.1007/s40011-012-0067-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40011-012-0067-4													WOS:000316024600010

Sampling took place during both the rainy and wet seasons. However. the resident time of each visit usually lasted a day or two, which definitely could affect the quality and quantity of the data collected. This was the first time the herpetofauna of the Kyoga Lake Basin was documented. A total of 18 amphibian species were recorded in the whole of the Kyoga Lake Basin. Lakes Nawampasa, Nakuwa and lyingo on the main lake showed the highest species diversity (12, 13, and 12, respectively) followed by Kawi (10 spp.) and Agu (nine spp.). Lakes Bisina (six spp.) and Nyaguo (five spp.) were species poor. Reptilian diversity was poor with L. Nakuwa being the most species rich site (six spp.). The Nile crocodile was reported in lyingo, Nakuwa and Bisina only. However, the Nile monitor lizard was recorded in all the lakes sampled.

The summertime phytoplankton assemblage in abysmally deep (Zmax: 589 m) Crater Lake, Oregon, consists of over 100 species, which are variously distributed in the upper 200 m of the vertical water column. The depth distribution of the lake''s three most prevalent species follows a predictable pattern: Nitzschia gracilis in the 0.20 m stratum, Tribonema sp. at mid-depth (80-120 m), and Stephanodiscus hantschii in the lowermost stratum (160-200 m). These major species, which account for approximately 80% or more of the lake''s total phytoplankton biomass and primary production, exist under atypical temperature, light, and nutrient conditions. 2. The spatial distribution of phytoplankton in Crater Lake resembles a three-tier structure. Unlike most lakes, where the entire phytoplankton communities exist in less disparate environmental conditions, or are vertically mixed periodically by storm events and seasonal lake turnover, the Crater Lake community is partitioned into stratified environments. 3. The disparate and unusual characteristics of these environments, and the hydrological and limnological stability of the lake basin, are perhaps important factors regulating the diversity, dominance, and partitioning of the lake''s phytoplankton populations.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				DEC	1987	18	3					429	442		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1987.tb01328.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1987.tb01328.x													WOS:A1987L289300004

Carolina ash (Fraxinus caroliniana Mill.), baldcypress (Taxodium distichum [L.] Rich.), red maple (Acer rubrum [L.]) and swamp tupelo (Nyssa silvatica var. biflora [Walt.] Sarge.) were the important tree species, with smaller amounts of cabbage palm (Sabal palmetto [Walt.] Lodd), button bush (Cephalanthus occidentalis L.), and several species of oak and elm. Tree mortality 3 yr after flooding was closely related to water depth, but it also varied with species and diameter. All trees of all species had died in parts of the reservoir flooded in excess of 1.3 m. Mortality decreased progressively as prevailing water depth decreased below 1 m. At 0.8 mortality averaged 41%, at 0.7 m it averaged 17% and at 0.2 m it averaged 2%, about the same as natural mortality in unflooded areas of the swamp. Baldcypress, swamp tupelo and cabbage palm were the most flood tolerant. The oaks were least tolerant. Measurements at the end of the 4th, 6th and 7th growing seasons showed that the rate of mortality had dropped to low but still above natural levels. Under all flooding depths mortality was least in the larger trees, those > 38 cm in diameter. Trees < 13 cm in diameter suffered the greatest losses. As depth of water increased, the proportion of the root systems killed by flooding increased and the amount of starch in tissues of living roots decreased.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1980	61	6					1412	1421		10.2307/1939050	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1939050													WOS:A1980LJ99400018

The occurrence of redox species [Mn(II)/Mn(III,IV), Fe(II)/Fe(III), As(III)/As(V), and Cr(III)/Cr(VI)] in the anoxic hypolimnion of Lake Greifen is compared to the thermodynamic redox sequence. The reduction and oxidation processes are discussed. As(III) appears in the anoxic hypolimnion together with Fe(II) and sulfide, whereas only indirect evidence for the reduction of Cr(VI) is found. The concentration of Zn is influenced by binding to algal material and to manganese oxides. The precipitation of manganese oxides during lake overturn affects trace elements by adsorption and oxidation reactions on the oxide surfaces. The cycles of As, Cr, and Zn are strongly coupled to the cycles of Mn and Fe.					; Sigg, Laura/AAI-3504-2020	Sigg, Laura/0000-0002-2210-2951; 													0065-2393		0-8412-2526-5				1994	237						473	497																WOS:A1994BZ52H00015

Factor analysis of the 22 measured physical and chemical variables reduced the data to six derived environmental factors: hardness, dystrophy, lake size, salinity, oligotrophy, and seasonality. The analysis showed that the low-pH lakes are associated with dystrophy and hence are likely to be naturally acidic. There was no evidence of anthropogenic acidification. Eight groups of co-occurring taxa were recognized from the data set, and all but two exhibited relatively consistent habitat preferences. It was suggested that the groups represent "species associations: in the sense that each group contains taxa that occur together because of similar requirements for a specific set of environmental conditions. Several lake types were identified as potentially influencing the distribution of phytoplankton in Labrador: small, dystrophic lakes; clear, softwater lakes; clear, hardwater lakes; large, hardwater lakes; and coloured, hardwater lakes.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				SEP	1986	43	9					1804	1811		10.1139/f86-224	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f86-224													WOS:A1986D601200013

Differential filtration was used to separate net and nannoplankton. The dominant dinoflagellate, Peridinium cinctum f. vestii, had photosynthetic uptakes ranging from 90 to 400 pg Chl[chlorophyll]-1 cell-1 and assimilation numbers ranging from 0.8 to 4. The highest activities were associated with cells at the beginning of the growth season (Jan.-Feb). Small nannoplankton algae which accompanied Peridinium contributed a disproportionally large fraction of the total community photosynthesis. The nannoplankton species were 10-fold more active in terms of C assimilation/C biomass and their renewal times were correspondingly more rapid. In the 1st half of the year, when the dinoflagellates dominated, the algal renewal time ranged between 7.9 and 13.7 days. In the 2nd half of the year, when small algae were dominant, the renewal time ranged from 1.4 to 2.2 days, without drastic fluctuations in different years.																			0003-9136						1982	96	1					33	46																WOS:A1982PX13600002
J	ZARET, TM				ZARET, TM			THE STABILITY-DIVERSITY CONTROVERSY - A TEST OF HYPOTHESES	ECOLOGY												The hypothetico-deductive method (i.e., hypothesis testing) to examine a venerable and still unresolved ecological issue: the relation between species diversity and community stability is used. Data from freshwater fish communities were used to test related hypotheses. The data presented on fish species diversity from the 4 major lake basins of Africa support the hypothesis that stable environments have more species than relatively less stable ones. The data presented from a natural perturbation in Panama, the introduction of a predatory fish, refute the hypothesis that stable environments have greater resilience (i.e., faunal stability). In the latter test, predation by an introduced piscivore caused the local extermination of 13 of 17 native fish species in the environmentally stable lake system, but caused no local extermination in the adjacent and relatively less environmentally stable river system. Stable environments, associated with a higher species diversity, will have lower (faunal) stability. System characteristics, such as physical heterogeneity or seasonality, may be more important in determining community species resilience than the number or species diversity of resident species.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1982	63	3					721	731		10.2307/1936793	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1936793													WOS:A1982NV13400016

However, as closed bodies of water, these lakes are facing a wide range of water quality problems due to their poor rate of exchange with external water sources. Thermal stratification, in particular, which is highly dependent upon meteorological conditions, has a great impact on the quality of their water. To gain insight into this problem, Truc Bach Lake, which is located in the northwest of Hanoi's central region, was chosen as a typical lake that would thus be a favorable place to conduct a case study. In our research, the water quality variables of Truc Bach Lake during its daily cycle were measured on site and were sampled periodically (over four seasons) for laboratory analysis, in order to investigate the vertical dynamics of its water quality during a daily cycle, as well as the seasonal changes that take place in a single year. The results of this study provide much valuable information on the temporal and spatial changes of the lake's water quality over the course of a year. They also provide a foundation for the simulation of the water quality dynamics in the targeted lake, which would provide a useful basis for further research.

Seasonally autocorrelated data were analyzed using Kendall's median trend slopes and compared with a randomization test. These results were then compared to the within-subjects effects from repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVAR). Both methods produce complimentary conclusions when contrasting the different results between years. Trend Slope Analysis (TSA) is a valuable alternative to ANOVAR for temporally dependent data and should be used where there is belief that the time series are complicated by non-normality, missing values, non-polynomial fit due to extreme values, or lack of treatment/subject replication.						france, robert/0000-0002-9171-8426													0030-1299	1600-0706				OCT	1992	65	1					45	51		10.2307/3544886	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3544886													WOS:A1992JH67600006

Samples were taken 2 km offshore near Echo Bay and Conjuror Bay in the upper 40 m of the water column. There were 20 spp. found in the plankton, of which 10 were crustaceans, 7 were rotifers and 3 were protozoans. The most common crustaceans in both areas were Diaptomus sicilis, Cyclops scutifer and Holopedium gibberum; dominant rotifers included Keratella cochlearis, Kellicottia longispina and Asplanchna priodonta; and the prevalent protozoan was Codonella cratera. Crustaceans reached a total maximum density of 3.1 .times. 103 animals m-3 in Aug., whereas the combined totals for rotifers and protozoans were 10.5 .times. 103 and 13.2 .times. 103 animals m-3, respectively. These densities and the total number of species are among the lowest recorded for freshwaters and are probably related to low (< 6.degree. C) water temperatures and phytoplankton availability (< 90 mg m-3). The slight temporal and spatial variation in these factors and in water chemistry during the study also possibly accounted for the similarity in the species composition of the plankton between the 2 widely separated sampling areas, the small vernal and autumnal fluctuations in abundance of the common rotifers and protozoans, and the homogeneous vertical distribution of several species in the upper 30 m of the water column.																			0004-0851						1981	13	1					95	103		10.2307/1550629	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1550629													WOS:A1981LJ50300009

The Swartvlei system is connected seasonally with the sea and varying salinity gradients are observable. The vegetation of the upper lake-like portion of the system experiences salinities of approximately 10.permill. and is composed of a shallow water (1 m depth) Charophyta zone with an outer, deeper (.+-. 3 m) fringe of P. pectinatus L. The influence of light and turbulence on these communities is discussed. The lower, estuarine portion of the system is more saline and has extensive Ruppia and Zostera beds whose distributions are related to salinity gradients. All these communities support a dense periphyton. The significance of the low number of aquatic macrophyte species in the system and in other such brackish coastal systems is discussed in relation to human interference.

J	DEMERONA, B				DEMERONA, B			AMAZON FISHERIES - GENERAL-CHARACTERISTICS BASED ON 2 CASE-STUDIES	INTERCIENCIA					INTERNATIONAL SYMP ON MAJOR LATIN AMERICAN RIVERS ( SISGRIL )	MAY 28-JUN 03, 1990	CIUDAD GUAYANA, VENEZUELA					Despite their great economical importance, small scale fisheries in the Amazon are poorly understood, mainly because of a dramatic lack in data. In order to improve this situation, two detailed studies of fisheries in the Brazilian Amazon have been conducted between 1980 and 1988. The first study dealt with the lower Tocantins river where a large dam, under construction at the beginning of the observations, was closed in September 1984. The fishing activities before the closure of the dam are described. On a geographical basis, four successive areas can be recognized throughout the whole section of river under study. In each of these areas, the fishing activities are somewhat independent. The most downstream area is exploited by three different fisheries, two of them are monospecific and the other one is a multispecific, multi-gear activity. In the other areas only multispecific fisheries using mainly two types of gears are observed. After the closure of the dam, a dramatic drop in the catches and in the cpue was observed in the most downstream area, although no significant effect was noticed in the area immediately below the construction. In the man-made lake, the fishery spontaneously developed in about one year after the closure and the catch raised rapidly in an exponential way. The second study took place in the Central Amazon, more precisely on a large sedimentary island in the main channel of the Amazonas river near Manaus. The fishing activity is very complex, including micro scale local activities and market oriented ones. The latter can, inturn, be divided into two separate fisheries a "migration" fishery, catching by use of seines, the schools of fishes in in their lateral movements between the floodplain and the river, and a "lacustrine" fishery using a variety of gears in the floodplain itself. The yield of both fisheries exhibits the same seasonal pattern and a parallel year to year evolution from 1976 to 1988. From these results a general discussion on some characteristics of the fisheries in the Amazon is developed. Heterogeneity, specific diversity, high yield and a great variability in time seem to be the main features of the Amazon fisheries.																			0378-1844					NOV-DEC	1990	15	6					461	468																WOS:A1990EX20400016
J	KERFOOT, WC				KERFOOT, WC			DEFENSIVE SPINES - INVERSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COEFFICIENTS OF VARIATION AND SIZE	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Coefficients of variation for spine lengths are not constant over a range of mean values, but show an inverse relationship with sample means. The nearly hyperbolic relationship is evident in selection experiments, in seasonal samples from a single lake, and in widely dispersed geographic samples. The observed inverse relationship could indicate an interesting developmental property (e.g. that smaller, rudimentary spines are more variable than larger functional ones) or could reflect one of several possible statistical artifacts or properties. Detailed examination of Bosmina suggests that the strong inverse trend arises from a combination of biological and statistical properties; it is not an artifact of measurement error, although measurement error contributes to inflation of small values. Small spines are inherently more variable than longer spines, and the later have more uniform component parts. Moreover, there are several alternative arrangements of components that sum to the same length and hence that achieve nearly equivalent fitness value. These alternative arrangements lower part-whole correlations within the population. The two statistical properties that contribute to observed trends include a version of the central limit theorem and measurement error. The percentage variation of a character which is the sum of a number of randomly varying parts will be considerably less (roughly as the inverse square root of the number of parts) than the mean percentage variation of the parts themselves. Thus a statistical property of large numbers contributes to the observed inverse trend. In addition, coefficients of variation as fractions are especially sensitive to measurement error, so that precise measurements are recommended for small defensive spines.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	1988	33	6	1				1412	1429		10.4319/lo.1988.33.6.1412	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1988.33.6.1412													WOS:A1988T062500016
J	CATTANEO, A				CATTANEO, A			SIZE DISTRIBUTION IN PERIPHYTON	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												When periphytic organisms growing on artificial plants were grouped in logarithmically increasing size classes, patterns in the distribution of biomass were consistent over the season and under different grazing regimes, despite taxonomical changes in the dominant taxa of algae and invertebrates. The amount in each size class was not constant, and instead, certain classes tended to have values consistently lower or higher than the mean. The locations of these peaks and troughs in the size distributions coincided with those observed in lake plankton. Despite these irregularities, the hypothesis that the biomass in logarithmic size classes is constant apparently applies at a crude level, for the biomass of most size classes lay within an order magnitude of the mean. This rule of thumb also applies to the littoral fish community, for the minnow biomass was approximately that in a periphyton size class.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				NOV	1987	44	11					2025	2028		10.1139/f87-250	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f87-250													WOS:A1987M733800026

Phytoplankton chlorophyll-a concentration ranged from 2 to 85 mg . m-3, the seston concentration from 8 to 148 mg dry weight . l-1 and gilvin concentration from 0.79 to 1.11 m-1 (9440). The vertical attenuation coefficient (K(d)) varied between 1.56 and 6.76 m-1. The relative effects of water itself, gilvin, phytoplankton, and tripton on a, b and c showed relatively small seasonal variation. The relative effects of water and gilvin on c were of minor importance (less than 10 %). Phytoplankton contributed 6 to 20 % to a, 3 to 33 % (with a peak value of 55 %) to b and less than 30 % to c. Tripton was the dominant factor determining the diminution of irradiance penetrating the water column in Lake Veluwe. Irradiance was strongly scattered which was mainly due to tripton. The spectral distribution of the photosynthetically active radiation was progressively compressed with depth into a region between 550 and 700 nm. Water absorbed strongly in the red regions of the spectrum, and gilvin and seston in the blue regions. The seston concentration was positively correlated with wind-induced resuspension of bottom material. It was concluded that an improvement of the underwater light climate requires a reduction of resuspension of bottom particles.

We recorded 64 nesting attempts. In 2003, 33% (n = 39 nests) of the occupied nests were from the previous breeding season. The average time for building new nests was 57 d (SD = 30.6; range 18-83 d; n = 5 nests). Males contributed 75% of the nesting material. All nests were built of dry sticks and other unique nest materials. During the nest building period, 83% (n = 241) of the dry sticks were collected less than 50 m from the nest tree. The unique nest material was collected from the ground and delivered to the nest 10 d prior to egg-laying. The average distance between neighbouring nests was 264 m (SD = 270.8, range = 26-1 081, n = 33 nests). Yellow-billed Kite nests averaged 9.6 m (SD = 2.4; range 4-14.8 m; n = 64 nests) above ground level and 64% (41 of 64 nests) were in tamarind trees (Tamarindus indica).

Seasonal Fluctuations In Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb Concentrations In Surface Microlayers And Subsurface Water Of Two City Ponds	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 16TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON HEAVY METALS IN THE ENVIRONMENT	E3S Web of Conferences				16th International Conference on Heavy Metals in the Environment (ICHMET)	SEP 23-27, 2012	Rome, ITALY					We owe the knowledge concerning the surface water microlayer to the wide research into marine environment and relatively scarce research done into inland city ponds ecosystems. The surface microlayer is a very thin, several hundred micrometers thick layer at the contact of water and atmosphere. This important form of air-water exchange ecotone, which constitutes the surface microlayer of water, is a specific environment as to its chemical and physical characteristics and is different from subsurface waters. It can absorb chemical substances like heavy metals, phytoneuston and bacteria in larger quantities in comparison to lower parts of the water. This characteristic feature results, among others, from the processes of transport at the contact of hydrosphere-atmosphere and also transport within the very area of surface water microlayer. The paper describes transport processes of six heavy metals: Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb from subsurface water to surface water microlayer and vice versa, analyzed in a one year cycle. The transport of chemical substances under consideration was described on a basis of experiments made during the period of one year at five city pounds in Slupsk (Polish Pomerania). During the research, samples of the surface water microlayer were collected by means of application of the Garrett mesh technique. At the same time, samples of subsurface water were collected and tested as to the content of the same parameters as the surface microlayer. Samples were sampled in month intervals. The concentration of aforementioned heavy metals was measured by mass spectrometry method and used Perkin Elmer Elan DRC aparature.																			2267-1242						2013	1								24008	10.1051/e3sconf/20130124008	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/20130124008													WOS:000326475400194

EVALUATION OF DOMESTIC SLUDGE AS A NUTRITIONAL SOURCE FOR MAIZE (Zea mays L.) UNDER KASHMIR TEMPERATE CONDITIONS	APPLIED BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH												Several sewage treatment plants have recently been constructed in Srinagar city (Jammu & Kashmir) around the famous Dal lake but without any proper sewage management consideration. Land-fill as sludge disposal option is not so attractive due to the space limitation in the city. However, recycling sludge for agricultural use may not only serve as an ecofriendly and safe route for sludge disposal but also may improve soil health. Field trials were conducted at Agricultural Research Farm, Krishi Vigyan Kendra, SKUAST-K, Shuhama, Srinagar during kharif seasons of 2008-09 and 2009-10 to evaluate the effect of integrated use of locally generated sludge and chemical fertilizers on maize productivity and soil fertility. Highest maize grain yield (4630 kg ha(-1)), stover yield (7270 kg ha(-1)) and nutrient contents in grain (15.5 g N, 4.3 g P, 4.8 g K, 32.1 mg Zn, 2.5 mg Cu, 8.5 mg Mn and 26.1 mg Fe kg(-1)) and stover (6.2 g N, 1.4 g P, 17.2 g K, 39.3 mg Zn, 5.2 mg Cu, 44.8 mg Mn and 242.7 mg Fe kg(-1)) were found in treatment 75% of recommended NPK + 30 t sludge ha(-1). This was followed by statistically at par treatments of 100% recommended NPK + 15 t sludge ha(-1), 75% recommended NPK + 15 t sludge ha-1 and 50% recommended NPK + 30 t sludge ha(-1.) Significantly high N, P, K, Zn and Fe uptake by the crop was observed in 75% recommended NPK + 30 t sludge ha(-1) treatment in comparison to other treatments. The treatments receiving sludge significantly improved organic carbon, available macro-nutrients and DTPA-extractable micro-nutrients in soil over 100% NPK. The study revealed that the integrated use of sludge @ 15 t ha(-1) + 75-100% recommended NPK or sludge @ 30 t ha(-1) + 50-75% recommended NPK may help in sustaining maize yield and improving soil health under climatic conditions of Lesser Himalayas.

PHYTOPLANKTON AND ZOOPLANKTON MODELING IN THE CHAHNIMEH MAN-MADE RESERVOIR BY MEANS OF ISSADM	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The increase of phytoplankton and zooplankton in the lakes and reservoirs that supply water to downstream regions is an important environmental issue. In this paper, concentrations of phytoplankton and zooplankton in Chahnimeh reservoir are predicted using an Integrated Seasonal Separate Advection-Diffusion Model (ISSADM). Chahnimeh reservoir is a seminatural deep hole that is stagnant in some part of the reservoir for most of the year. ISSADM is a three-dimensional numerical model based on a finite-volume solution that was developed to predict water quality in lakes and reservoirs affected by seasonal rivers. The model is capable of simulating water-quality parameters, as well as phytoplankton and zooplankton concentrations. To verify the model, field measurements and experiments conducted during a one-year period were compared with model results, demonstrating good agreement. The model is appropriate for predicting phytoplankton and zooplankton concentrations as well as eutrophication processes in similar, seasonal, aquatic environments.

However, the glacier dynamics study of this type glacier is still limited in most of glaciated area due to the remote mountains, and high altitude issues. Meanwhile, the surface displacement of polythermal glacier appears strong variations both in seasonal and even shorter time-scales, based on the principles of glaciology mechanics. On one hand, this seasonal variations indicate drainage and movement of melting water between ice body and glacier bed. On the other hand, shorter variations relate to the amount of input water for this supraglacial drainage system. Here, we choose five typical polythermal type glaciers in Nyaingentanglha Mountains, the south of Nam Co Lake, Tibetan Plateau for a case study. In this study we monitoring the ice surface displacement of these glaciers nearly two decades from 1993 to 2009 using features tracking method. Through this generation of ice motion maps, we intend to explore the association between spatial distribution of ice surface motion anomalies, and the possible patterns of ice speed variations during this period which responds to probable climate influence on surface melting.																			2153-6996		978-1-4799-1114-1				2013							3622	3625		10.1109/IGARSS.2013.6723614	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2013.6723614													WOS:000345638903174

Similar to many other places, these disasters also happens in the Dongting Lake after the construction and operation of Three-Gorge-Dam (TGD) in Yangtze River. Its water shortage problem in the lake plain becomes very severe and frequent, especially in dry seasons. This paper presents an innovative countermeasure to cater the dam's negative impacts on the middle reach, i.e., the application of SPP scheme to get rid of its water crisis (floods, droughts, deterioration of water quality and sedimentation caused by too much, too little, too dirty and too turbid waters, respectively). The so call SPP stands for "separation, prevention and protection", the feasibility of SPP application is discussed in terms of economically affordability and environmentally sustainability. The SPP scheme is compared with other schemes proposed by local governments, the results show that the payback period is almost same, but the SPP scheme is much better than alternatives in every aspect.																					978-7-302-33544-3				2013																								WOS:000370410301045

One management procedure is to prevent the hatching of eggs without desertion of the clutch by adults. Our objective was to test the extent of hatching suppression induced by several chemical treatments on (1) fertile, domestic chicken eggs in laboratory incubators, and (2) ring-billed gull eggs in the field. Hatchability of chicken eggs was significantly reduced (P < 0.05) by 2 applications of light-grade commercial petroleum oil and, in the field, hatchability of ring-billed gull eggs was reduced to zero by 2 applications of the oil irrespective of the stage of embryo development. Adults continued to incubate treated eggs for >6 weeks beyond the expected hatching time. Higher rates of preening and readjustment of nesting material were noted among adults incubating treated clutches compared to control adults. However, none of the experimental pairs deserted their clutches or renested in the breeding season of study.

P. plebejus juveniles remained only briefly in the river and were most numerous at sites near the river mouth. There was no distinct period of migration of this species from the river. M. bennettae and M. macleayi individuals remained in the river until Dec. and March, respectively, when in the absence of obvious abiotic stimuli such as rainfall runoff and reduced salinities, there was a marked egress from the river. While in the river, both of these species could be caught through the zone of salt-water penetration up to 35 km from the sea, and both were most numerous in the southern half of Lake Cootharaba in a zone of approximately 19 x 10-3 mean salinity. Similarity between these and other distribution patterns recorded in topographically different rivers suggests salinity is an important determining factor in the distribution of these prawns.

Such additional measurements assist both research and operational programs. However, for a particular lake or reservoir, altimetric products offered to end-users may differ due to choice of employed instrument, processing technique, and applied geophysical corrections. To explore these differences, particularly with their potential impact on climate-based research, an intercomparison of three web-based water-level products (produced by Laboratoire d'Etudes en Geophysique et Oceanographie Spatiale, National Aeronautics and Space Administration/United States Department of Agriculture, and European Space Agency/De Montfort University) has been undertaken based on 18 lakes and reservoirs. The products are well correlated with each other (r = 0.87 to 0.99) and where in situ data are available are quite well correlated with the gauge measurements (r = 0.73 to 0.99). Despite variations in data processing, the poorest root-mean-square differences between any altimeter product and gauge data (similar to 0.20 to 1.41 m) occur for the narrow reservoirs and smaller lakes. The largest discrepancies between the altimeter products occur for the lakes that freeze (Lake Athabasca and Woods). The current altimeter products provide acceptable accuracy, long-term trends and seasonality for climate applications. We discuss the merits of each product system, but recommend further validations and the provision of ice-detection flags. (C) 2012 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

J	KEAST, A				KEAST, A			PLANKTIVORY IN A LITTORAL-DWELLING LAKE FISH ASSOCIATION - PREY SELECTION AND SEASONALITY	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												A littoral zone assemblage of 6 planktivorous fishes (Pimephales notatus, Notropis heterodon, Fundulus diaphanus, Lepomis macrochirus, Ambloplites rupestris, Perca flavescens), and 5 zooplankter species [Bosmina longirostris, Chydorus sphaericus, Sida crystallina, Simocephalus vetulus and Polyphemus pediculus], was analyzed relative to 3 hypotheses concerning prey consumption: Size-dependent predation will operate, as elsewhere. Small-bodied planktivores, unable to handle larger prey, will take the most abundant zooplankter and not show species specialization. The strongly cyclical nature of zooplankton populations will not permit fish species to specialize exclusively on zooplankton; there will be a negative correlation between zooplankton numbers and use of alternative prey and at this time the planktivores will minimize competition by choosing different alternative prey. The 1st hypothesis was supported, the 2nd and 3rd partially so. The small planktivores, Pimephales notatus and N. heterodon, did not take the commonest small zooplankter, B. longirostris: rather, they specialized largely on C. sphaericus, feeding on it even when rare. L. macrochirus, a generalist, took largely B. longirostris. No species was exclusively planktivorous. The species only partly differed in alternative prey types eaten. Chironomid larvae were a regular item of diet of most species.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1985	42	6					1114	1126		10.1139/f85-138	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f85-138													WOS:A1985ALP7900007
J	SOLLBERGER, PJ; PAULSON, LJ				SOLLBERGER, PJ; PAULSON, LJ			LITTORAL AND LIMNETIC ZOOPLANKTON COMMUNITIES IN LAKE MEAD, NEVADA-ARIZONA, USA	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Zooplankton were collected from adjacent littoral and limnetic sites in Lake Mead, Nevada-Arizona, USA. Limnetic species dominated both littoral and limnetic zooplankton communities; littoral species rarely exceeded 2% of monthly total zooplankton densities. Low species richness of littoral taxa and high similarity in species composition between littoral and limnetic habitats appeared to result from uniform horizontal physical and chemical environments, due to horizontal mixing, and from the absence aquatic macrophytes. Significant differences in spatial distribution occurred in phytoplankton biomass, total zooplankton density, and fish abundances; highest concentrations of these factors occurred nearest an inflow high in nutrients and progressively declined farther below the inflow. These factors generally showed no significant difference between adjacent littoral and limnetic sites. Large variation also occurred in seasonal zooplankton community structure among some sites.																			0018-8158					AUG 7	1992	237	3					175	184		10.1007/BF00005849	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00005849													WOS:A1992JM95300004

At the Noora disposal basin in South Australia the waste irrigation water (EC = 17-19 dS m-1) has formed a lens in the top of the highly saline (50-80 dS m-1) regional groundwater (Parilla Sands) aquifer. Using salinity and environmental isotopes of water (deuterium and oxygen-18) the lens has been shown to extend about 500 m in a northwesterly direction from the disposal pond. The major effects of this lens have been: (1) to cause upwards displacement of the regional ground water over an area of about 285 km2, implying increased evaporation from areas surrounding the lens; (2) to reduce evaporation of regional ground water from the central low-lying area. Electromagnetic induction techniques for detecting preferred flowpaths away from the basin were rendered ineffective in this environment because of lithologic variations within the dune system. However, examination of bore-logs and groundwater gradients indicated that there was little evidence of stratigraphic control of mound development. Salinity in the Parilla Sands aquifer was closely related to the depth of the water table from the soil surface. Shallow (2-4 m) water tables were affected by recharge and evaporation to a much greater extent than ground water located below the higher dunes. There was, however, an almost instantaneous pressure response throughout the whole groundwater system to changes induced in the low-lying areas. Analyses of piezometric data showed that there was a seasonal variation imposed on the groundwater mound development. Corrected mean annual water-table increments and estimates of the mound volume and area were derived from a Theis response curve of the water table rise associated with the mound alone. Calculations using fitted parameters from the Theis analyses also suggested high transmissivity values, but are subject to uncertainties in limited data on specific yield. Although comparison of the mound volume and the disposed volume indicates extensive losses, isotopic and salinity data do not support substantial evaporation of the disposal water. However, them is that the already more saline regional waters are subject to increased evaporation in topographic lows which come within the influence of the elevated water table. Hence the problem to be faced in the future is the contamination of the River Murray system by Parilla Sands water rather than from waste water leaking laterally from the disposal basin. Results from this study show that the effect of disposal of the waste water is dominated by the density of the water relative to the regional waters. The assessment of the environmental impact of water disposal at other sites should, therefore, give careful consideration to this aspect, which is not adequately incorporated into groundwater models in current use.

Water temperature, pH, concentration of dissolved oxygen (with calculation of water saturation with O-2), COD-Cr and BOD5, total hardness, HCO3- concentration (as total alkalinity), Cl-, SO42-, Mn-tot and Fe-tot were also determined. The data collected may be used to evaluate the ecological and chemical status of the surface waters under investigation. As far as the ecological status of the Rusalka Lake is concerned, the investigated waters were found, based on the official criteria being in force in Poland in evaluation of the ecological and chemical status of surface waters, to conform to water quality classes I and II considering total zinc and copper concentrations, temperature and dissolved oxygen concentration (except water inflow to the lake in August) as well as BOD5, SO42- and Cl- concentrations and pH value; however, they were always worse than water quality class II while taking the COD-Cr values into account. Regarding the chemical status of the investigated waters, total cadmium and lead concentrations were the levels exceeding the admissible values according to the official criteria in Poland. Changes in the values of indices being investigated along water flow path allowed stating that the equilibriums between the sedimentation and the resuspension and the dissolution processes during the research period were shifted towards sedimentation in case of Zn and Cd only, as well as of the organic matter sedimenting in the form of divalent cation- and divalent anion-sorbing gels. Although three phytoplankton blooms occurred in the body of water, unfortunately weak ones, the dissimilation processes prevailed over assimilation.

The annual ring widths usually had significant similarities between cores taken from the same tree and with cores taken from different trees. These similarities increased with tree size. The climatic change affected the large trees more strongly than it did the small trees. Micro environmental changes, such as canopy gap affected the small trees more strongly. Annual ring widths were also correlated with the annual precipitations at Jumla 30 km south of the plots for a recent 20 year period. A multiple regression analysis between ring width and seasonal precipitation showed that the growth of A. spectabilis was correlated primarily with the rain from May to August and secondarily with that from September to December in the previous year.																			0006-808X					SEP	1990	103	1071					297	312		10.1007/BF02488641	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02488641													WOS:A1990EF90800004

This beach annual exhibited large intrapopulation variation in plant size, seed production, and seed mass. The plants grew large in favourable microenvironments on the beach. For example, close to the lake the plants had significantly greater crown area and number of seeds per plant than those farther inland primarily due to higher soil moisture and nutrient content of occupied microsites. A large number of seeds within fruits were aborted but abortion was significantly higher (74%) in lower than upper fruits (14%). The coefficient of variation for mass per seed was 53% for upper seeds and 48.5% for lower seeds. Mean seed mass per plant decreased as the season progressed from July to September. The data suggest that C. edentula responds to unstable shoreline habitat by phenotypic plasticity in plant size, reproduction, and fruit abortion.																			0749-0208	1551-5036				WIN	1989	5	1					103	112																WOS:A1989R759000011

During the mating season male D. triton perform dislays consisting of leg-waving, single or successive jerks, and palpal drumming. The jerks cause bursts of concentric water surface waves which may provide information for the female. Jerk-generated waves are considerably regular in the time course, have a duration of 900 .+-. 145 ms, and do not contain frequencies above 55 Hz. In contrast, terrestrial insects trapped at the water surface generate wave stimuli which are long lasting (in most cases > 2 s), irregular in the time course, and usually include frequencies above 55 Hz (Lang 1980; Bleckmann 1985a). Thus wave signals produced by male Dolomedes during courtship behavior lack "prey" (insect) wave characteristics, which may ensure that female Dolomedes and other surface dwelling predators do not regard the courting males as insect prey.																			0161-8202	1937-2396				FAL	1987	15	3					363	369																WOS:A1987M872100007

At Aberthaw Beach, 25.9 km of line was collected from a 400 m length of beach over 12 months. At Cold Knap, 3.2 km was collected over 10 months. The amount lost per angler session was estimated to be 3.0 to 13.7 m at Aberthaw and 0.5 to 1.7 m at Cold Knap. The amount and composition of line lost seemed to be determined by local conditions on the beaches. At Llanishen Reservoir, 341 m of line was recovered from 225 m of bank after the first two weeks of the fishing season. Retrievability factors were used to correct this estimate, and subsequently it was calculated that anglers deposited approximately 41 fragments (total length 6.6 m) on the bank during each visit to the reservoir. Contamination of coarse fisheries by discarded lead shot was found to be almost universal. Densities of shot ranged from 5 to 300 m-2, more heavily fished waters and popular pegs generally having the highest densities. The dissolution of shot in sediment is a very slow process. It was calculated that anglers dropped 4-7 shot per session at Hendre Lake.																			0301-4797	1095-8630				SEP	1987	25	2					125	135																WOS:A1987J598700003

Peak NO3- concentrations in the sediments are in the range of the half-saturation constant, and thus, for a given temperature, kd [denitrification rate constant] varies by a factory of approximately 2 over the typical range of NO3- concentrations. Most diagenetic sediment denitrification models employ a single-valued rate constant kd to described NO3- dependence, but the use of a constant kd for eutrophic lake sediments may result in a significantly erroneous estimate of annual denitrification loss.

ANC varied significantly with both discharge and time of year in 12 streams. Generation of ANC seasonal variations, being dependent upon the precise timing and magnitude of seasonal variations in cation and anion concentrations, was unique to each stream. Greatest seasonal ANC variations occurred in streams where seasonal variations in major anion and cation concentrations were completely out of phase. Maximum errors that could occur because of extrapolation of ANC data from one time of year to another were equal to or greater than maximum errors due to extrapolation of ANC from one discharge to another.																			0043-1397					APR	1997	33	4					801	807		10.1029/96WR03852	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/96WR03852													WOS:A1997WQ77800026

When viewed in the context of data from several streams, however, baseflow measurements of variables such as acid neutralizing capacity, pH and NO3- are likely to be highly correlated with the episodic extremes of those variables from the same stream and runoff season. We illustrate these correlations for a water chemistry record, nearly two years in length, obtained from intensive sampling of 13 small Northeastern U.S. streams studied during USEPA's Episodic Response Project. For these streams, simple regression models estimate episodic extremes of acid neutralizing capacity, pH, NO3-, Ca2+, SO42-, and total dissolved Al with good relative accuracy from statistics of monthly or annual index samples. Model performances remain generally stable when episodic extremes in the second year of sampling are predicted from first-year models. Monthly or annual sampling designs, in conjunction with simple empirical models calibrated and maintained through intensive sampling every few years, may estimate episodic extremes of acidification chemistry with economy and reasonable accuracy. Such designs would facilitate sampling a large number of streams, thereby yielding estimates of the prevalence of episodic acidification at regional scales.																			0043-1370					APR	1997	33	2					359	366																WOS:A1997WX81100012

WAVE ACTION, SEDIMENTS AND WATERFOWL GRAZING	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Limitations on the growth of the 2 most important submerged macrophytes in Loch Leven, [Scotland, United Kingdom], Potamogeton filiformis and P. pectinatus, were shown to result from wave action and from grazing by waterfowl. Wave action operates directly, by reducing plant biomass in exposed situations, and indirectly, by producing coarser, more nutrient-poor sediments in exposed situations. Protection from wave action and from waterfowl grazing by ''Perspex'' tubes and by wire enclosures led to increased biomass levels, and these findings were corroborated by transplant experiments between a sheltered and an exposed site. Up to 80% of the end-of-season biomass differences could be attributed to the effects of wave action, and the remainder to waterfowl grazing. Shoot lengths of completely protected plants of P. filiformis at the exposed site were only half those of plants growing at the sheltered site, and this difference was correlated with differing P levels in the sediments. Maximum biomass levels, however, were still low compared with published data for other eutrophic lakes, and this reduction was attributed to the combined effects of phytoplankton competition, wave action and grazing. The implantations for management of the lake in the light of these findings are discussed.																			0022-0477	1365-2745					1977	65	2					431	446		10.2307/2259493	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2259493													WOS:A1977DN67500007

The percentage of photosynthetically fixed CO2 incorporated into protein did not vary diurnally, but the variation observed over 3-day periods was as large as that found seasonally, which suggested that changes in environmental conditions occurred during these intervals. Several of the biochemical measurements did not change during the year, including the ratios of chlorophyll a or phycoerythrin to protein and protein to dry weight; the ratios of carbohydrate or RNA to protein were more promising indicators of long-term changes in the physiological state of the population because there were seasonal changes in these. Alkaline phosphatase activities were measured in the epilimnion and metalimnion as an index of phosphate limitation. In the epilimnion levels were similar to those found in phosphate-limited algal cultures, whereas in the Oscillatoria layer the activities were 7-fold lower.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1982	27	6					1154	1161																WOS:A1982PT42800015
J	BROCK, MA				BROCK, MA			REPRODUCTIVE ALLOCATION IN ANNUAL AND PERENNIAL SPECIES OF THE SUBMERGED AQUATIC HALOPHYTE RUPPIA	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The allocation of resources to reproductive and non-reproductive parts was investigated in annual and perennial species of the submerged aquatic halophyte Ruppia. Dry weights were recorded for plants from permanent and ephemeral ecosystems in the south-east of South Australia over 13 mo. in 1977 and 1978. One perennial species, R. megacarpa, and 2 annual species R. tuberosa and R. polycarpa, were studied. The proportion of plant dry weight allocated to reproduction, both sexual (seeds, flowers, fruit parts) and asexual (turions) was much greater in all seasons for the 2 annual species than for the perennial. Seeds and turions of the annuals comprised 100% of live parts (3 g m-2 for R. tuberosa, 2 g m-2 for R. polycarpa) during the 7-8 mo. when the lakes were dry, in contrast to the maximum allocation to reproduction of 4.5% (seeds, 10.8 g m-2) for the perennial R. megacarpa. When vegetative growth was maximal for the annuals, the minimum allocation to reproduction occurred (13% (9.1 g m-2) for R. tuberosa and 5% (4.8 g m-2) for R. polycarpa). Rhizomes alone survived desiccation and formed separate reproductive units in the modified form of dormant turions in the 2 annual species. Although the 2 annual species were similar in their total reproductive effort they showed differences in the distribution of this effort between asexual and sexual reproductive units: R. tuberosa had 89% turions and 11% seeds whereas R. polycarpa had 14% turions and 86% seeds in the dry season. These results are consistent with those reported for terrestrial annual and perennial species in other studies. The monocarpic reproductive pattern, rapid development of the plants, early maturity and large amount of energy allocated to the production of a large number of small propagules are characteristic of both annual species. This contrasts markedly with the polycarpic reproductive pattern, slow plant development, late maturing and the smaller amount of energy allocated to producing a small number of large propagules in the perennial.																			0022-0477	1365-2745					1983	71	3					811	818		10.2307/2259594	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2259594													WOS:A1983RR52200011

In situ measurements of gelbstoff spectra (glambda; m(-1)) for the photosynthetically active radiation wavelength (lambda) interval (400-700 nm), and values of g440, matched closely values obtained through traditional laboratory spectrophotometric analyses. The advantages of the high vertical resolution capability of the in situ absorption instrument (similar to10 measurements per meter of depth) was demonstrated through the depiction of the vertical details ( subsurface peak about 2.25 m thick) of the enrichment in gelbstoff that occurred following a major runoff event, associated with the entry of inflow(s) as a plunging interflow. Values of g440 increased at the depth of the subsurface peak by nearly 100% as a result of this event. The detailed vertical resolution of gelbstoff is valuable to managers of water supply lakes and reservoirs to support selection of intake depths to avoid delivery of water with high levels of color, and to researchers investigating the origins, fate and transport of this material.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				APR	2004	517	1-3					171	177		10.1023/B:HYDR.0000027345.29244.1e	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000027345.29244.1e													WOS:000221338200013

Mink (skinned carcasses) from Coeur d''Alene River system (northern Idaho) were obtained from trappers during the 1981-82 (n = 17) and 1986-87 (n = 14) seasons. Livers of all eight mink from the uncontaminated North Fork contained low levels of lead; whereas, 9 of the 23 mink from lateral lakes adjoining the contaminated main stem, downstream from a mining-smelting complex, contained potentially hazardous lead levels (.gtoreq. 5 .mu.g/g). Stomach contents of nine mink contained variable concentrations of lead (0.15 to 51 .mu.g/g); sampls from the main stem contained the highest values. No difference was detected in lead concentrations in livers of mink trapped from the lateral lakes in 1981-82 and 1986-87. Levels of cadmium were low in all samples, but lead levels were the highest ever recorded in mink. Our results suggest that metal pollution has probably led to localized declines in mink populations.																			0029-344X	2161-9859				AUG	1990	64	4					219	223																WOS:A1990EA00100005

The range of DFAA concentrations in the reservoir and both rivers were similar with dominant DFAA consisting of serine, glycine, alanine and ornithine in all three systems. The range of DOC concentrations in the rivers was 1.5-11.1 mg l-1, the major river (Crocodile) having about twice the DOC concentration of the Magalies River. The DFAA/DOC ratios ranged between 0.02-1.1% in the Crocodile River and 0.13-3.7% in the Magalies River. DFAA and DOC concentrations were positively correlated to the Magalies River flow, but for the Crocodile River, which received domestic and industrial effluents, DOC was inversely correlated to flow. The source of DFAA in both rivers was mainly terrestrial, in contrast to the main DOC source in the Crocodile River which was the effluents. The DFAA load of the Crocodile River ranged between 0.22 and 208 kg C d-1. DOC (5.0-24.8 mg l-1) in Hartbeespoort Dam generally decreased with depth but DFAA (15-4800 nmol l-1) concentration showed no clear trend. The DFAA/DOC ratios varied between 0.02 and 2.9%. DFAA concentrations were correlated (r = 0.3, n = 30, p = 0.04) with bacterial numbers at 0 and 10 m only while no significant correlations were found with bacterial production, chlorophyll a concentration and phytoplankton primary and EDOC (extracellular DOC) production at any depth. The rate of bacterial utilization of DFAA was low compared with data from other lakes. Diurnal phytoplankton production of DFAA in the euphotic zone of the whole lake was calculated to vary between 268 and 30,780 t C d-1 indicating autochthonous DFAA sources were dominant to allochthonous DFAA sources. The autochthonous production of DFAA was > 2 .times. gross bacterial production of the euphotic zone indicating that although DFAA concentrations were frequently < 10 .mu.g C l-1, the rate of DFAA production exceeded bacterial requirements.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUL 31	1990	199	3					201	216		10.1007/BF00006353	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00006353													WOS:A1990DU99100004
J	TOFT, CA				TOFT, CA			POPULATION-STRUCTURE AND MATING SYSTEM OF A DESERT BEE FLY (LORDOTUS-PULCHRISSIMUS, DIPTERA, BOMBYLIIDAE) .2. FEMALE DEMOGRAPHY, COPULATIONS AND CHARACTERISTICS OF SWARM SITES	OIKOS												Toft (1989) established that males of the bee fly Lordotus pulchrissimus gather daily in aerial swarms on stabilized dunes on the north shore of Mono Lake, Mono Co., California, [USA] during August. This paper provides data on female demography and distribution, copulations, and habitat characteristics and evaluates the mating system of L. pulchrissimus. Females emerged four or five days later than males, on average, and emerged for ca. 20 d beginning the first week of August, more than half the season of adult activity (30 to 40 d). Females appeared to have a life expectancy of about 10 to 14 d, somewhat longer than males, and to mate only once, within three days of eclosion. At peak abundance, approximately when females stopped emerging, females occurred at a density of five per ha. Individual females ranged over an area of 60 to 100 m in diameter, on average, during a 10 to 14-d period. Although sizes overlapped considerably, females were on average smaller than males. Individuals found in copulation were larger than individuals in the general population; this difference was significant for males but not females. These data suggest intrasexual selection favoring large males, and in addition, there was weak tendency toward size-assortative mating. Copulations lasted up to 10 min and most occurred in a half-hour period around 1100 hours, Pacific Daylight Time, when the peak number of the males occurred in the aerial swarms (Toft 1989). Swarms of male L. pulchrissimus did not occur where resources for females or their offspring were found in greater abundance than in the habitat at large, nor was there any obvious encounter convention such as attraction to hill tops. I conclude that L. pulchrissimus exhibits lek polygyny and fits the scenario proposed for the evolution of this mating system in insects.																			0030-1299	1600-0706				MAR	1989	54	3					359	369		10.2307/3565297	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3565297													WOS:A1989T785900014
J	Henning, MH; Ebert, ES; Keenan, RE; Martin, SG; Duncan, JW				Henning, MH; Ebert, ES; Keenan, RE; Martin, SG; Duncan, JW			Assessment of effects of PCB-contaminated floodplain soils on reproductive success of insectivorous songbirds	CHEMOSPHERE					15th International Symposium on Chlorinated Dioxins, PCB and Related Compounds	AUG 21-25, 1995	EDMONTON, CANADA					From the 1930s through 1977, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were used in manufacturing processes at an industrial facility in Pittsfield, Massachusetts (USA). While use of PCBs was discontinued in 1977, inadvertent releases prior to that time were conveyed to the Housatonic River and deposited in river sediments downstream of the facility. During periodic flooding, river sediments containing PCBs were deposited on soils of the 10-year floodplain within an area managed for wildlife conservation. Based on investigative reports of the study area, concentrations of PCBs in surficial floodplain soil (top 15 cm) in the river reach containing that area range from non-detect to 75 mg/kg, with a mean of 12 mg/kg, while PCB concentrations in the surficial sediments in this reach of the river range from 0.04 mg/kg to 200 mg/kg, with a mean of 33 mg/kg. Pursuant to the Massachusetts Contingency Plan and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, an ecological risk assessment was designed to evaluate the potential risk of harm posed to the ecosystem by the contaminated floodplain soils. Some of the studies included in this risk assessment have been completed. One such study focused on reproductive success of passerine (i.e., songbird) populations. This assessment endpoint was evaluated based on comparisons of clutch sizes, numbers of eggs hatched, and hatching success of eight species of songbirds living within the floodplain (target population) to those of reference populations nesting outside of the floodplain and to ranges reported in the scientific literature. Approximately 300 natural nests were monitored throughout the 1993 breeding season and reproductive outcome was evaluated on both an overall basis and a species-specific basis. Clutch sizes and numbers of young hatched were not significantly different between target and reference groups for individual species, although sample sizes were generally small. Mean clutch sizes plus or minus one standard deviation were well within normal ranges reported in the literature for all species considered and for both target and reference groups. Hatching success of reference and target nests was 88.4 percent and 87.4 percent, respectively, a difference that is not statistically significant (p=0.77). This endpoint was examined for the target and reference communities rather than individual species, and sample sizes were 45 and 60 for reference and target groups, respectively. Overall, PCBs in the Housatonic River system do not appear to be adversely affecting reproduction in songbirds at the community level. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	REDDY, KR				REDDY, KR			DIEL VARIATIONS OF CERTAIN PHYSICOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS OF WATER IN SELECTED AQUATIC SYSTEMS	HYDROBIOLOGIA												A field study was conducted during the months of Oct., Jan., May and July (1979-80) to examine the diel variations in dissolved O2 (DO), pH, dissolved CO2, bicarbonate and carbonate alkalinity, NH4-N, NO3-N, and PO4-P concentration and conductivity of the water in 6 aquatic systems. Water in hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) ponds showed very little or no diel or seasonal variations in DO, pH, dissolved CO2 and bicarbonate alkalinity. Dissolved O2 concentration of the water under floating hyacinth cover was in the range of 0.2-3.0 .mu.g/ml, while dissolved CO2 levels were in the range of 10-35 .mu.g/ml. In the aquatic systems with no floating vegetation, i.e., elodea (Egeria densa) pond, cattail (Typha sp.) pond, control pond (filamentous algae and Chara spp.) and eutrophic lake (algae in Lake Apopka [Florida, USA]), DO and pH of the water increased during mid-day and decreased during the night. Dissolved O2 levels in these ponds were in the range of 5-20 .mu.g/ml during mid-day and 2-8 .mu.g/ml during the night, while pH of the water was in the range of 8-9.5 during mid-day and decreased to 7-8 during the night. An inverse relationship occurred between bicarbonate and carbonate alkalinity of the water in the aquatic systems with no floating vegetation while no carbonates were detected in the water with floating hyacinth plants. Ammonium N, NO3-N and PO4-P concentration of the water in these aquatic systems showed very little or no diel variations.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1981	85	3					201	207		10.1007/BF00017610	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00017610													WOS:A1981MR20500002

Distinct seasonal variations in dissolved and particle associated PCBs were observed over a two year period at the lake outlet; the lowest values occurred during ice-cover periods while the highest values occurred during summertime. Total dissolved PCBs ranged from 1.4-34 ng/L while total particle associated PCBs varied from 2.1-105 ng/L. An average of 71% of the total PCBs were associated with particles. Both PCB fractions were dominated by ortho-chlorinated di-, tri-, and tetrachlorobiphenyls with IUPAC #28+31 accounting for the greatest portion. Some changes appear to have taken place in the environmental composition of congeners since PCBs first entered this waterway through effluent discharges.																			0045-6535					JUN	1992	24	12					1921	1941		10.1016/0045-6535(92)90244-L	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0045-6535(92)90244-L													WOS:A1992JN54900023

No consistent relationship were found between DON and particulate-N, primary productivity rates or chlorophyll concentrations. However, increases in DON concentrations were observed in the early growing season on 1982 and 1984 when water temperature was rising and a diatom bloom was senescing. DON increased at a high rate (0.31 mg atom N n-3 day-1), and then rapidly disappeared. Sediment release appeared to be the most important source of DON. Dissolved free amino acids were always less than 7.5% of the DON pool, and did not vary in the composition of specific amino acids during the growing season.

Large numbers of adult midges emerging from these water bodies pose nuisance and economic problems. During 1992 and 1993 we initiated comprehensive studies on the nature and scope of the nuisance midge problem in the valley. We sampled on a biweekly basis 2 lakes supplied with well water, 2 supplied with tertiary effluent water, and one supplied with a mixture of these 2 sources, to determine the midge larval fauna and the mode of existence, seasonal abundance, and population trends of these midges. Climbers, clingers, portable sand tube builders, and tube builders on plants predominated in well-water habitats with submerged vegetation and detritus bottoms. Tube builders and burrowers predominated in the tertiary water, which characteristically had a detritus bottom, devoid of vegetation. Habitats holding a mixture of the 2 water types with sandy bottoms supported midge larvae known to be sprawlers.																			8756-971X					MAR	1995	11	1					77	85											7616195					WOS:A1995QV79600015

Successful and flooded nests seemed to be structurally similar, although on average successful nests were significantly larger. However, among the flooded nests there were more atypical nest types than among the successful nests; this is probably due to a local lack of nest material and suitable nest sites, but could not be related to any differences in nesting habitat. The large nests are probably favourable as they can withstand wave action and rising sea water better. The greater investment in nest-building among grebes in the archipelago is probably not due to a specific "strategy", but to the mechanical reactions to the continuous changes in sea water level.																			0003-455X	1797-2450					1988	25	4					293	298																WOS:A1988R668000004

They included weekly and variable period bulk deposition measurements. The resulting annual and seasonal deposition estimates from the four methods were compared for numerical and statistical differences. Several results unexpected from the theory of the measurement methods appeared in the comparison: (1) one of the bulk deposition measurements produced lower deposition of acid-related ions than the two wet-only measurements and (2) the monthly wet-only measurements produced higher deposition of sulphate than the two bulk deposition data sets (by 6 and 19%). Several results were consistent with the theory of the measurements: (1) the daily wet-only measurements produced deposition values lower than the weekly bulk deposition measurements and (2) the wet-plus-dry deposition measurements produced higher estimates of sulphate and nitrate deposition than the two bulk data sets (15-35% higher).

THE MTATA RIVER ESTUARY	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												The species composition, seasonal abundance and spatial distribution of the fish fauna of the Mtata estuary (8,5 km long) was determined by means of gill nets. Nine hundred and ninety fish (462,9 kg) comprising 26 species were caught of which Magil cephalus (43,3%), Argyrosomus hololepidotus (18,9%), Pomadasys commersonnii (7,9%), Elops machnata (7,1%) and Lichia amia (5,45) were most abundant in terms of biomass. Mullet species constituted 48,3% of the biomass caught, representing 25,6% of the numbers. Seasonal patterns were ascertained for M. cephalus, M. capensis, Valamugil buchanani, A. hololepidotus, P. commersonnii, P. kaakan, E. machnata, L. amia, Johnius dussumieri, Thryssa vitrirostris and Leiognathus equula. A mean of 19,4 fish with a mean mass of 9,1 kg were caught per net per station. Numerically the highest catches were made in the upper reaches; gravimetrically in the middle reaches. Temperatures ranged from 10,5-25,5.degree.C; a salinity gradient was usually present in all reaches; oxygen levels and turbidities were high.																			0254-1858					OCT	1989	24	4					282	289																WOS:A1989CQ61000008
J	FINLAY, BJ				FINLAY, BJ			EFFECTS OF SEASONAL ANOXIA ON THE COMMUNITY OF BENTHIC CILIATED PROTOZOA IN A PRODUCTIVE LAKE	ARCHIV FUR PROTISTENKUNDE												Seasonal deoxygenation of the benthos in a productive lake is responsible for radical changes in the resident community of ciliated protoza. Significant decreases in the mean density (8747 to 2152 cm-2) and biomass (132 to 6 .mu.g C cm-2) of the benthic community accompany the disappearance of O2 from the sediment. The large drop in biomass is accounted for by the migration into the water column of the larger (> 150 .mu.m) aerobic ciliates and the failure of the developing community of small sapropelic ciliates to reach high densities. Ciliate C represented on average 1.81% of total C in oxidized sediment and 0.08% in anoxic sediment.																			0003-9365						1982	125	1-4					215	222		10.1016/S0003-9365(82)80018-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0003-9365(82)80018-3													WOS:A1982NH84600017

Each cAMP fraction occurred in quantities comparable to those reported for cultured phytoplankton spp. [Anabaena flos-aquae, Microcystis aeruginosa, Scenedesmus communis and Pandorina morum]. Both cAMP fractions varied greatly in concentration during the season and between the oligotrophic and hypereutrophic lakes. Increases in phytoplankton community densities were paralleled by weight-specific changes in particulate cAMP levels, depending on the phytoplankton species present. A linear relationship between cellular cAMP levels and in situ primary productivity rates occurred in the oligotrophic lake. In both lakes, certain phytoplanktonic associations had particulate cAMP levels linearly related to chlorophyll a content and specific activity of alkaline phosphatase.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1982	27	1					27	38		10.4319/lo.1982.27.1.0027	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1982.27.1.0027													WOS:A1982NA27100003

The decline of the bloom was not associated with changes in any single physical or chemical parameter of the lake water, although the ambient N:P ratio was higher before the peak. C, N and chlorophyll in the cells were almost constant over the growth season, averaging 48, 4 and 0.9% of the dry weight, respectively. There was an initial drop in cell P from 0.7 to 0.2% of the dry weight which then remained stable after April. During the bloom period, the carbohydrate and lipid content of Peridinium decreased, nucleic acid increased and protein showed no definite trend. Apparently, Peridinium is not severely nutrient-limited during most of the growth season and criteria, based upon cellular composition used to define nutrient status in other groups of algae, may not be directly applicable to armored dinoflagellates.																			0142-7873	1464-3774					1982	4	1					125	136		10.1093/plankt/4.1.125	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/4.1.125													WOS:A1982NE42900009

To identify these longitudinal gradients, a two-year investigation (May 1991 to October 1992) was conducted to measure primary productivity, nutrient concentrations, chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass at three locations in the 705-ha water supply reservoir. Emphasis was placed on the measurement of primary production using the carbon-14 artificial incubator (photosynthetron) technique. The average annual production in 1992 was 247.3 g m(-2) 245 d(-1) ranging from 52 to 2677 mg C m(-2). Mean alpha(B) (assimilation efficiency), P(B)m (assimilation number), and I-k (saturation irradiance) were 4.40 mg C mgChl(-1) E-1 m(-2), 3.82 mg C mgChl(-1) h(-1), and 236.5 mu E m(2) s(-1), respectively. Neither seasonal nor spatial variability of these photosynethetic parameters were observed. Except for Secchi depth, distinct longitudinal zones from river inflow to dam were not statistically demonstrated in the Tomhannock Reservoir. Mean extinction coefficient, chlorophyll a and total phosphorus concentrations decreased; Secchi transparency and phytoplankton biomass increased; while primary productivity and dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentration remained the same from headwater to dam. These baseline data will be used to assess the future effectiveness of best management practices (BMPs) recently instituted on selected watershed farmland in an attempt to reduce the detrimental impact of agricultural activities on drinking water quality.																			0043-1370					FEB	1997	33	1					35	45		10.1111/j.1752-1688.1997.tb04080.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.1997.tb04080.x													WOS:A1997WX81000005

PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY, QUANTUM YIELDS AND PHOTOSYNTHETIC RATES IN SMALL NORTH GERMAN LAKES	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Photosynthetic characteristics of phytoplankton assemblages were investigated in situ at weekly intervals throughout the year in both the Plubsee and the Edebergsee, from 1981 to 1984. Findings of the previous 20 years in the Plubsee are confirmed. Primary productivity is estimated at about 500 mg m-2d-1 for the entire year, corresponding, as do chlorophyll concentration and extinction coefficient to data given for mesotrophic or moderately eutrophic lakes. The differing primary production of the two lakes is compared in relation to their morphometry. Maximum quantum yields are constant in the light-limited range, varying between 0.01-0.08 moles C Einstein-1 absorbed, depending largely on the stage of algal growth. Three differnet algal assemblages had values of about 0.06 moles C Einstein-1 absorbed when measured during growth stages. The chlorophyll specific light attenuation (kc) for five algal populations ranged between 0.007-0.2 m2mg-1 chlorophyll-a. Other photosynthetic characteristics varied as follows: the initial slope of the light-saturating curve, .alpha.B, lay between 0.0025-0.015 mg C (mg chl-a)-1mE-1m2; the onset of light saturation, Ik, between 49-320 .mu.Em-2s-1; the maximum photosynthetic capacity, Pmax, between 1-4 mg C (mg chl-a)-1h-1. The controlling action of global radiation is demonstrated by season and latitudinal dependant shifts of both the light-proportional photosynthesis and Pmax. Data of Pmax suggest that values are often below 5 mg C or 15 mg O2 (mg chl-a)-1h-1 in meso- and eutrophic waters between the 50th-74th latitude north, in contrast to similar waters at lower latitudes.																			0003-9136						1985	104	3					363	385																WOS:A1985APV8100006

Monitored parameters included filtered and total Cu; phytoplankton identification and enumeration; chlorophyll a, in situ 14C assimilation; bacteria numbers; zooplankton identification and enumeration, macrophyte nutrient status and filtered reactive and total P. The low level application caused only small increases (maximum of 5 .mu.g/l) of short duration (2-5 days) in filtered Cu. The treatments failed to induce effective algicidal action in the target phytoplankton populations of the lake, but they did induce short term stress and alterations in the natural seasonal succession processes within these populations. No definitive responses in the zooplankton, submerged macrophytes or water column P levels were noted. Dramatic reductions in the water column bacteria occurred immediately following each treatment, indicating direct negative impact.

The modelling data lead to the following conclusions: (1) groundwater exploitation in the Siauliai waterworks would increase the water losses from the boggy basin negligibly (from 7 to 9 mm/a when the total runoff is over 150 mm/a (2) the annual and long-term runoff and water level regimes in the raised bog, that separates the peat deposit from the lake as a 3 km long and 0.26 to 0.8 m wide belt, are rather variable. Depending on the season, from 80 to 95% of the runoff from it is formed in the 0.3-0.5 m thick top layer (acrotelm) distinguished by anomalously good filtration properties and porosity; (3) at the end of the peat deposit exploitation, the discharge from the protective bog to the lake presumably will reduce by 0.2-0.4 l/s (about 1% of the total lake runoff) and that from the bog to the peat deposit will increase by about 0.5 l/s (depending on the season, 1-15% of the total runoff from the bog); and (4) seasonal recharge of acrotelm is capable of counterbalancing the loss therefore the status of protective bog will remain close to the actual one.																			1648-6897	1822-4199				SEP	2012	20	3					185	195		10.3846/16486897.2012.720418	http://dx.doi.org/10.3846/16486897.2012.720418													WOS:000309324500002

The expanded hypodigm reveals that the species belongs to the subfamily. Tetraconodontinae and not the Suinae as previously thought. There is no relationship to the species Kolpochoerus afarensis as recently suggested and biostratigraphic estimates of the age of the Nyaburogo and Nyawiega sequences using such identifications need to be amended accordingly. On the basis of other mammals, the strata in which the species occurs, are considered to be uppermost Miocene to lowermost curs, are considered to be uppermost Miocene to lowermost Pliocene in age. Nyanazchoerus waylandi is so far restricted in distribution to the Nyaburogo Formation, Uganda, but a similar or smaller species may occur in the Nkonbdo Formation, Uganda, of lower Pliocene age.																			0016-6995	1777-5728					1989	22	5					641	651		10.1016/S0016-6995(89)80117-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0016-6995(89)80117-2													WOS:A1989CP82200005

This has provided the opportunity to compare the incidence of urinary tract cancer mortality in populations exposed to heavy chlorinated and lightly chlorinated drinking water. The spatial, diurnal, and seasonal concentration of chlorination by product (trihalomethane) in Houston were assessed. The range of concentrations varied from below the limits of detection in treated ground water, to more than 200 mg/l (twice the level allowed by US drinking water standards) in treated lake water. The mortality experiments by higher, by race, and by age cohorts for the period 1940 to 1970 from urinary tract cancers and three comparisons caused was determined for 56 of Houston''s census tracks classified by the duration of purine to the surface water. By the 1970''s 20 years following the switch to surface water, an increase was detected in urinary cancer majority rates for white females without a corresponding increase observed for white males. No clear-cut trends were found for the population. On balance, a detrimental urinary cancer effect associated with a switch to chlorinated surface water has not been demonstrated yet.																			0300-5771	1464-3685				JUN	1987	16	2					198	207		10.1093/ije/16.2.198	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ije/16.2.198								3610447					WOS:A1987H880200007

Fish were sampled by beach seine at 24 sites in three types of nearshore habitat; concrete stepped embankment, stony rip-rap and sandy-gravel beach. The most common species was asp, Aspius aspius (63.9%) followed by roach, Rutilus rutilus (21.8%) and ide, Leuciscus idus (9.0%). Other species represented <3% of dominance. Beach stations were significantly preferred by 0+ juvenile fish (p<0.001) during the daytime, with a CPUE of 31.4 specimens per 1 m net. An almost 15 times lower density of fish was registered at concrete steps and stony rip-rap embankment types, however with a more homogenous distribution of juveniles. Contrary with large rivers a single synchronic survey strategy of 0+ juvenile fish does not describe representatively natural recruitment success in large shallow reservoir.					; Jurajda, Pavel/F-9647-2014; Reichard, Martin/C-6563-2009	Jurajda, Pavel/0000-0002-4651-0415; Reichard, Martin/0000-0002-9306-0074													0139-7893						1997	46	3					279	285																WOS:A1997YG23000010

We report here the rickness of the protozoan biotas in relation to environmental gradients from an ecosystematic survey of a large, coastal plain river. Communities were collected from natural and artificial substances concurrent with water chemistry analysis at 11 sites along the Flint River and Lake Blackshear impoundment. Community similarity, the distribution of collected taxa in functional feeding groups, and trhe relation of communities to environmental gradients were evaluated. Two principal components determined from water chemistry data showed important downstream gradients of decreasing water hardness and increasing nutrient levels. Taxonomic richness was high; 200 to 450 taxa were collected depending on season and collecting technique. Artifical substrates provided the richest collections. Bactivorous species were the vast majority of all taxa collected. Community composition showed an orderly transition from upstream to downstream, and photosynthetic forms were enhanced at nutrient enriched sites. Communities were strongly influenced by increasing nutrient levels. Protozoan community analysis showed that microbial community composition reflects human influences on river ecosystems. Since microbial species exploit detrital resources and respond sensitively to human influences, they can provide important information regarding ecosystem conditions.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAY 20	1987	148	2					159	174		10.1007/BF00008402	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008402													WOS:A1987H660900009
J	OLIVER, BG; VISSER, SA				OLIVER, BG; VISSER, SA			CHLOROFORM PRODUCTION FROM THE CHLORINATION OF AQUATIC HUMIC MATERIAL - THE EFFECT OF MOLECULAR-WEIGHT, ENVIRONMENT AND SEASON	WATER RESEARCH												Humic material from various aqueous environments and from laboratory microbial cultures was segregated into humic and fulvic acid fractions and then each fraction was separated into 8 MW ranges by ultrafiltration. The fractionated material was then chlorinated in aqueous solution and the amount of CHCl3 produced was measured. CHCl3 concentration per unit weight humic material passed through a maximum at MW about 20,000-30,000 for the fulvic acids, whereas the CHCl3 concentration decreased with increasing MW above 20,000-30,000 for the humic acids. Only minor fluctuations in CHCl3 concentrations were apparent for samples from various aqueous environments (lake, river, stream, swamp, microbial) and for samples from a single environment obtained during different seasons of the year. Based on the total amount of material isolated from the original samples and the CHCl3 production per unit weight, the major CHCl3 precursors in aquatic humic material were the low MW (< 30,000) fulvic acid fractions. Because of their low MW and high surface activity, these fractions will probably be the most difficult to remove by standard water treatment processes.

B	Allanson, BR		Gopal, B; Wetzel, RG		Allanson, Brian R.			Limnology in South Africa: Past and Present Status and Future Needs	LIMNOLOGY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, VOL 4	Limnology in Developing Countries											This contribution to the well known series of "Limnology in Developing Countries" is an attempt to synthesise and place in perspective some aspects of the limnology of South Africa, and, where immediately relevant, of neighbouring countries such as Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe and Lesotho. The origins and development of limnology in the and subcontinent have been largely, but not exclusively, the responsibility of a number of biologists beginning in the 1930s with the defining studies of Evelyn G. Hutchinson and his colleagues of the pans and recently built reservoirs on the South African highveld. The years following World War II were times of rapid industrial expansion in the heartland of South Africa, the Witwatersrand. The demand for a sustainable supply of good quality water was urgent leading to the building of large reservoirs on the major rivers, the Zambezi, Orange/Vaal and Tugela. The evolution of civil engineering was dramatic, and the past 30 years have seen impressive interbasin transfer schemes in which water from relatively water rich catchments is transferred to water poor areas. Hydrobiological river and reservoir studies concentrated upon the impact of organic and mineral pollution of rivers and the eutrophication of reservoirs, using as a template for rivers, changes in the Great Berg River. And although there was a spread of effort on the reservoirs, almost all were descriptive, following the trends found in the Northern Hemisphere. With the institution of the International Biological Programme, the emphasis in hydrobiological research shifted to process orientated investigations in natural lakes. For example, Lake Sibaya became an important focus in which the causes of dwarfism among the dominant cichlid fishes are sought, and the adaptive behavioural response of catfish to varying water level, particularly during breeding is neatly established. The hypereutrophic status of Hartbeespoort Dam, a reservoir to the east of Pretoria, was intensively studied to establish the factors responsible for such rapid enrichment, and the management consequences. Existing levels of salinization, and acid and organic pollution of both rivers, and reservoirs are of immediate concern. With increasing emphasis upon the supply of clean water to South Africa's population (46 million), the aridity of the aquatic landscape is underlined. Wetland loss and river pollution can no longer be tolerated. The National Water Act of 1998 introduces a new and far reaching paradigm to guide the peoples of this land in the wise use of this tenuous resource. The concept of instream flow requirements (IFR) is introduced, based upon a legal requirement that the structure of the river, and its hydrodynamic properties, are essential to the plants and animals which occupy the diversity of ecological niches. The response of the river scientists was immediate and innovative. New methods for assessing the flow requirements are developed around the central theme of the natural variation in river flow, leading to the definition of a seasonal flow regime which will allow the character of the river to remain unaffected while allowing sustainable use. The new vision of river and standing water studies is to accept the paradigm, essentially based upon ecosystem variability, which recognises that survival depends upon such variability. This challenge should define ongoing limnological research in South Africa																					978-81-86047-23-1				2004	4						1	116																WOS:000268460100001

A hydrodynamic model with a k-epsilon turbulence model and the thermodynamic exchanges at a water surface was firstly tested to reproduce seasonal variations of temperature distributions in the vertical direction. Then the water quality parameters such as phytoplankton (Chlorophyll-a), zooplankton, organic and inorganic nutrients are combined with a water temperature prediction model, using a standard modelling of ecological processes. It was shown that the calculated water quality distributions agree with the observed ones qualitatively, and the model may be applicable to predict the effect of global warming, though further investigations are required to identify the model parameters.																					90-5809-662-9				2004							357	365																WOS:000189447700036

J	Abtew, W; Obeysekera, J				Abtew, W; Obeysekera, J			Drainage generation and water use in the everglades agricultural area basin	WATER RESOURCES BULLETIN												The Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA) covers 2,850 km(2) in area and is characterized by high water table and organic soil. The area is actively irrigated and drained as a function of weather conditions and crop status. Anthropogenic activities in the basin have resulted in nutrient-enriched drainage water that is discharged to Lake Okeechobee and the Everglades ecosystem. Water quantity and quality issues of the basin have become of increasing interest at local, state, and federal levels, so legislative and regulatory measures have been taken to improve water quality in discharges from the basin. In this study, simulation of hydrologic conditions and soil moisture were conducted using 100 years of daily synthetic rainfall data. From the simulations, the statistical distribution of half-month drainage discharge and supplemental water use in the basin was developed. The mean annual drainage/runoff was 49 cm, the mean supplemental water was 30 cm, and the mean annual areal rainfall was 122 cm. On the average, drainage exceeded supplemental water use in the months of June to September while from December to March drainage and supplemental water use were equivalent. Supplemental water use exceeded drainage in the months of October, November, April, and May. High drainage occurred in June and September; smallest drainage was in February. On the average, the highest supplemental water use occurred in May and November. The 10-year return period of annual drainage during wet and dry cycles were 60 cm and 38 cm per year, respectively. The semi-monthly drainage coefficient of variation (cv) is above 100 percent for the period from the second half of October to end of April. The cv is lower than 100 percent for the remaining season (wet season). The purpose of this paper is to present the magnitude, temporal, and frequency distribution of drainage/runoff generation and supplemental water use in the EAA basin. Information on statistics of drainage will contribute to the optimization of the design and operation of drainage water treatment systems.

J	COBELAS, MA; ROJO, C				COBELAS, MA; ROJO, C			SPATIAL, SEASONAL AND LONG-TERM VARIABILITY OF PHYTOPLANKTON PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN LAKES	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												A cross-system, worldwide approach has been used to ascertain the spatial, seasonal and long-term variability of areal phytoplankton photosynthesis (PP) in lakes using published data sets. Also, the average fraction of annual PP occurring under ice is calculated. The lakes considered embrace a range of properties (depth. mixing, flushing rate, latitude and trophic status). The overall yearly PP distribution is skewed to the left, suggesting the dominance of low PP rates in the data set. When comparing lake types, no differences in average PP have been found among them. In particular, there are no clear areal PP differences among lakes of different trophic status on yearly, averaged basis, suggesting that environmental limitations to PP also exist in lakes of higher trophic status. Volumetric-based PP can be better used to outline PP-based trophic differences, but some degree of overlap is also apparent. Across ail lake types (except in tropical lakes), the PP seasonal course experiences only one peak in the year, but its timing is clearly different for each lake type. The seasonal variability of PP is lower in tropical lakes, as previously reported, but the variability of the other lake types is roughly the same. Therefore, the effects of depth, mixing regime, flushing rate and nutrient status on PP seasonality are difficult to ascertain since they appear to be counterbalanced by other more pervasive. local effects. Particularly, there is no increase in temporal variability with the trophic status of lakes, suggesting that PP seasonal control by physical variables overrides that of nutrients. Also, no significant relationship between average PP and latitude has been found. Seasonal variability increases as the yearly PP increases. On a relative basis, there is a spatial gradient of seasonal variability of PP, which is weaker when seasonal variability of PP is considered in interyear comparisons. Long-term (i.e. interannual) variability of PP is clearly related to increasing yearly averaged PP. Specifically, in temperate, stratifying lakes the seasonal time course of PP is clearly different from that of phytoplankton biomass, suggesting an uncoupling of both variables as a result of differing P-max and losses throughout the year. On an average basis, environmental variables are poor predictors of areal daily PP, thereby implying that the interplay of factors is complex and changing throughout the year. PP under ice averages 10% of yearly PP, but its variability is high enough to make its measurement advisable.

J	YAMASAKI, S				YAMASAKI, S			POPULATION-DYNAMICS IN OVERLAPPING ZONES OF PHRAGMITES-AUSTRALIS AND MISCANTHUS-SACCHARIFLORUS	AQUATIC BOTANY												The water fringes of ponds and lakes in Japan are occupied by Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud. and Miscanthus sacchariflorus Benth. P. australis occupies a water habitat, whereas M. sacchariflorus thrives on the moist upper shoreline. The tow species overlap in the intermediate zone. The present study was undertaken to observe and record features of growth and population dynamics of these two species in a small pond, with particular reference to the overlapping zone. The factors considered were water level, oxygen diffusion rate, redox potential, rate and density of bud and shoot formation, rhizome length, rate of plant growth, population density and mortality rate. Observation and measurements were made twice a month from mid-April to mid-August, with a follow-up in October at the onset of the dormancy phase, and another the following February. Higher mortalities of P. australis in its dominant zone and of M. sacchariflorus in both the overlapping zone and its dominant zone occurred twice early in the growth season when the pond was flooded. After this, new shoots of P. australis formed to replace dead ones, but most of these also died before August; shoots emerging in mid-April in the dominant zone showed the highest survival rate by August. The emergence of P. australis in the drier area of the overlapping zone was displayed by about two weeks relative to that in wet areas.

The yearly means, polarity and seasonal dependence of each investigated parameter during 1985-1994 are estimated from fitted models. The bulk of data consists of 456 to 1149 measurements per parameter. L. Peipsi-Pihkva appears to be polar with respect to the majority of the studied parameters. The content of TP, PO4P, TN, Chl, CODCr, CODMn, and Col decrease from south to north, while SD has an opposite trend. pH, O-2, and O-2% are quite uniform all over the lake. L. Peipsi is eutrophic, L. Pihkva is hypertrophic. The lake is influenced by significant yearly and seasonal changes. It is concluded that the Velikaja River is the main source of pollution for L.

CELL-SIZE, NICHE DIVERSIFICATION AND THE ROLE OF COMPETITION	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The size spectra of phytoplankton from Hamilton Harbor [Ontario, Canada], Lake Ontario is described over a 5-yr period. Measures of average cellular chlorophyll were compared to the spectrum of measured cell volume (0-106 .mu.m3). Both measures showed strong seasonal cycles and year to year differences. Variations in the mixed layer dynamics accounted for the seasonal and year to year variability. A strong correlation between cell size and photosynthetic quantum efficiency was discovered which explained the fluctuations in cell size which occurred in response to changes in the mixed layer depth. Populations of small flagellates exhibited low quantum efficiencies; larger green algae exhibited efficiencies close to the theoretical maximum. Previously published productivity data which showed week to week fluctuations in physiological parameters in response to mixed layer depth changes were reexamined. Physiological changes were due to changes in the phytoplankton assemblages rather than to physiological adaptation. The distributions of small flagellates and large green algae were mutually exclusive. A disparity in growth rates between the 2 groups meant that the small flagellates rapidily dominated the assemblage under warm stable conditions; the larger green algae, with lower growth rates, took weeks to dominate the deeper mixed layers. Measures of cell volume indicated suppression of the growth of the larger green algae within 6-8 days of the onset of stability in the water column. Reduction in growth rate did not lead to rapid removal from the mixed layer so that both size classes appeared to coexist. Indices of diversity and chlorophyll per unit diversity (a measure of biomass concentration in few species) indicated that periods of temporal invariability in the condition of the mixed layer led to reduced diversity and increased biomass per unit diversity. Periods of temporal variability in the mixed layer depth led to high diversity and reduced biomass. Overall, the diversity of the phytoplankton assemblage is well explained by the intermediate disturbance hypothesis.																			0003-9136						1983	98	2					215	239																WOS:A1983RN59800006

In this technique, which has a spatial resolution of < 1 mm, much less than that of competing techniques (I cm), a thin layer of polyacrylamide gel is inserted into the sediment and after the rapid equilibration with the pore water, the gel is dried and fixed. The distribution of trace elements can then be measured using microbeam PIXE. Preliminary results have shown for the first time a subsurface maximum of Fe consistent with current theories of Fe dynamics. This paper presents some results obtained using the technique and discusses the limits on resolution and sensitivity. (b) Individual suspended lake particles (predominantly iron oxides and sulphides) have been analysed using point microbeam RBS and PIXE. Of particular interest in this study is the oxidation state of iron rich particles, so RBS with a 1 mum beam was used to determine the Fe:0 stoichiometry of single particles. The particles were filtered from a depth of 14 m in Esthwaite Water in the English Lake District and handled in anoxic conditions until evacuation in the SPM sample chamber. Two distinct compositions of iron oxide were determined in clusters of about 5 mum diameter. Analysis by PIXE revealed that FeS was uniformly distributed in the particulate material and that it also contained elevated levels of Cu and Zn. This study was the first to demonstrate directly that discrete clusters of iron oxides are present in black particulate material which is commonly considered to comprise iron sulphides.					; Davison, William/A-4901-2009	Grime, Geoffrey/0000-0002-4957-8175; 													0168-583X					MAY	1993	77	1-4					430	435		10.1016/0168-583X(93)95576-Q	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0168-583X(93)95576-Q													WOS:A1993KZ78200064

Birds nesting early in a breeding season traditionally occupy a preferred substrate area (logs, rocks, ground cover) at the western end of the linear colony site. Later nesting birds occupy remaining, open concrete substrate sites to the east. An experimental study area was established at the eastern end of the breakwall in late May 1982. The area contained 2 replicates each of 3 substrate types (control-bare concrete; enhanced-small rocks only; super-enhanced-small rocks, logs, plants). Late nesting terns which occupied the area preferred vegetated, high relief nesting substrate (super-enhanced) similar to that at the western end of the colony. Few terns nested on the control sites (bare concrete), the traditional nesting substrate of late breeders at this colony. Mean clutch size, hatching and fledging success were all higher on the super-enhanced substrate. Eggs and chicks disappeared at higher rates on the enhanced than on the super-enhanced substrates. Greater visibility of both eggs and chicks on the enhanced substrates (small rocks only) probably contributed to a greater loss rate due to predation than was the case on the super-enhanced substrates. Suitable substrate enhancement procedures, based on knowledge of preferred substrates at a particular colony, is a valuable management tool for improving productivity of late nesting terns.

Fishers' Adaptation to Climate Change in the Jebba Lake Basin, Nigeria	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION												The paper provides an analysis of adaptation of fishers' households to climate change around Jebba Lake Basin, Nigeria. Fisheries of Jebba Lake Basin are presented as a system of dynamic trends, seasonality and shock. An analysis of livelihood diversification reveals that some households are more adaptable to environmental change than others. Fishers who have become overly specialised in fishing as sole livelihood activity are least able to adapt. The study thus recommends increased capabilities of fishers through formal enlightenment campaigns in respect of other livelihood portfolios outside fishing for better livelihood diversification.																			1119-944X	2408-6851				JUN	2012	16	1					68	78		10.4314/jae.v16i1.8	http://dx.doi.org/10.4314/jae.v16i1.8													WOS:000420198800008
J	Zhou, YY				Zhou, YY			UV-sensitive P compounds: Release mechanism, seasonal fluctuation and inhibitory effects on alkaline phosphatase activity in a shallow Chinese freshwater lake (Donghu Lake)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Filtrable phosphorus compounds in a shallow Chinese freshwater lake (Donghu Lake) were fractionated by Sephadex G-25 gel-filtration chromatography. Some portions of those compounds released soluble reactive phosphorus upon irradiation with low dose ultraviolet light. Catalase and a hydroxyl radical scavenger (mannitol) markedly prevented photosensitive phosphorus release. The observed effects may be explained by the action of oxidizing reagents such as hydroxyl radicals, produced in photochemical reactions between UV irradiation and humic substances in the water. There was a strong seasonality in UV-sensitive P (UVSP) release. Michaels constants (K-m) of total alkaline phosphatase in the lake water showed a direct positive relation to UVSP. Plot of K-m against the UVSP/phosphomonoester ratio reveals a strong relationship between the two variables. These results suggest that in some situations UVSP may be a competitive inhibitor of alkaline phosphatase activity in the lake. The competitive inhibition of fractionated UVSP on alkaline phosphatase reagent (Sigma) apparently supports this hypothesis.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				OCT 16	1996	335	1					55	62																WOS:A1996VY79700007
J	BLUMER, LS				BLUMER, LS			REPRODUCTIVE NATURAL-HISTORY OF THE BROWN BULLHEAD ICTALURUS-NEBULOSUS IN MICHIGAN	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												Reproductive activity in the brown bullhead begins in May and spawning occurs in late May and early June at Munro Lake, Michigan. Most oviposition occurs during a 10- to 15-day period each year. Adults care for eggs (embryos), larvae and juveniles as long as 20 days after oviposition. Males and females breed with only one mate in each season. Care-giving involves nest-building prior to oviposition, and then guarding embryos, larvae and juveniles. In addition, embryos and larvae are fanned and manipulated by the parents at the nest site. Males alone give parental care more frequently than do females alone. When both sexes attend a brood, males spend more time with the brood, and more time in close proximity to the offspring than do females. For these reasons, males can be viewed as the principal care-givers. Male parental care occurs throughout the Ictaluridae and biparental care is common in the genus Ictalurus.																			0003-0031	1938-4238					1985	114	2					318	330		10.2307/2425607	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2425607													WOS:A1985AUY6800012

Individuals ranged in age from 1 to 62 mo. The largest specimens examined were a 180-mm SL [standard length] male and a 165-mm SL female. Females were mature at 3-4 yr and a mean SL of 119.4 mm. Mature oocytes, produced seasonally, ranged from 189 to 570 (mean = 377.8; N = 12) per female. Seven nests, each containing a clutch of embryos or larvae and guarded by a male, were found under large, flat rocks in pools and riffles. All nest-guarding males were 3 yr old and ranged from 87 to 105 mm SL (mean = 94.8). Nests were observed in early July at water temperatures of 27 to 29.degree. C. Clutch sizes ranged from 104 to 306+; embryos were spherical, opaque white or light yellow, and ranged in diameter from 2.6 to 4.0 mm (mean = 3.4 mm; N = 40). At hatching, mesolarvae ranged from 6.7 to 7.5 mm TL [total length]; development was similar to that described for other ictalurids. Stomachs of adults contained a variety of benthic organisms, primarily aquatic larval insects and decapod crustaceans. Great Lakes stonecats live longer, attain a greater maximum size, and have a higher absolute fecundity than southern inland stream populations. Comparisons with congeners indicate that N. flavus has life-history traits that are near 1 extreme within the genus, and they include a longer lifespan and a lower relative fecundity.

J	GOULDER, R				GOULDER, R			METABOLIC-ACTIVITY OF FRESH-WATER BACTERIA	SCIENCE PROGRESS												The metabolic activity of natural populations of freshwater heterotrophic bacteria has been investigated by measuring uptake of radiolabelled organic substrates. The activity frequently shows marked seasonal and spatial variation which is related to the physico-chemical environment, pollution and associated populations of microalgae. Secondary production of bacterial biomass is usually determined through incorporation of the radiolabelled nucleoside, H-3-thymidine, into bacterial DNA. Such measurements suggest that a substantial proportion of microalgal photosynthetic products in lake plankton may be incorporated into bacteria and thus become available to grazing zooplankton through a microbial loop in the food web. The physiological state of bacterial populations can also be assessed. Cell-specific activity is independent of population size, shows seasonal variation and may indicate stress induced by salinity change, extreme pH or toxic pollution. The proportion of total cells which are metabolically active may also be a stress indicator because a higher proportion of active cells is found in organically enriched habitats.																			0036-8504						1991	75	297	1-2				73	91																WOS:A1991GT25100005

Essentially all Ca enters via groundwater inseepage. Half of it is deposited as CaCO3 in the sediment; the other half leaves via outseepage and outflow. Aragonite, as determined by quantitative X-ray diffractometry, is the major phase present in the sediment. Aragonite: calcite ratios in six cores from epilimnetic sediment average 61:22. Aragonite: calcite ratios in six cores from hypolimnetic sediment average 23:20. The aragonite is derived from mollusc shells and is produced in the epilimnetic sediment because seasonal anoxia prevents growth in the hypolimnion. Rates of sedimentation are derived from Pb-210 methods. Ratios of mass accumulation rates (g m-2 yr-1) for aragonite: calcite average 302: 91 in epilimnetic sediment and 74:68 in hypolimnetic sediment. The hypolimnetic aragonite deposition is due to horizontal transport, with the probable decreasing order of dominance being downslope transport, wave redistribution, and intermittent complete mixing.																			0024-3590					JAN	1992	37	1					184	191		10.4319/lo.1992.37.1.0184	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1992.37.1.0184													WOS:A1992HV29500019
J	FREYTET, P; LEBRETON, ML; PAQUETTE, Y				FREYTET, P; LEBRETON, ML; PAQUETTE, Y			THE CARBONATES OF THE PERMIAN LAKES OF NORTH MASSIF-CENTRAL, FRANCE	CARBONATES AND EVAPORITES												During the Permian, large fluvio-lacustrine basins occurred within the West European Hercynian chain. The deposits were mainly detrital (conglomerates, sandstones and pelites). The two studied sites, Couy borehole and Aumance basin contain several dolomitic beds alternating with pelites containing Ostracods. The carbonate layers constitute various dolomitized facies with dolosparite, laminated and bituminous dolomites, oolites, oncolites and stromatolites, and pedological nodules. Microfacies are varied. The dolomite crystals can be either isolated rhombs scattered in pelites or rhombs and xenomorphic crystals cementing sandstones; in dolomicrites, dolomicrosparites and dolosparites, crystals are xenomorphous and very irregular in size. All the layers are interpreted as the result of the dolomitization of an initial calcitic mud. Some columnar stromatolites had their thin primary fabric well preserved by siliceous early replacement, while dolomitization poorly preserved laminations. The fluvio-lacustrine sediments associated with carbonates are red, mottled and grey. The carbonates were deposited in small lacustrine basins and in the flood plain pelites. Climate conditions were not desertic, but dry tropical with alternating wet and dry seasons allowing for a periodic hydromorphy responsible for oxido-reduction of iron, and carbonate nodulization.																			0891-2556						1992	7	2					122	131		10.1007/BF03175626	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF03175626													WOS:A1992KD66800006

This paper describes phenology patterns of the aquatic macroinvertebrates of a high elevation wetland (3593 m) in the Green Lakes Valley, Colorado Front Range. Abundant taxa were Chironomidae (primarily Orthocladius and the limnephilid trichopteran Asynarchus curtus (Banks).

Species abundance in water of low phosphate concentration may be traced instead to effective mechanisms for phosphate uptake which allow the cells to thrive at low ambient levels of PO4-P. Half-saturation constants of less than 0.5 .mu.M PO4-P can be demonstrated in laboratory cultures and in situ in lakes. Ambient concentrations of K+ can be toxic to a variety of species of Dinobryon and thus can limit their geographical and seasonal occurrence.

We examined relationships among: SO42- adsorption, soil properties, and seasonal variation in soil solution chemistry at 13 sites representing deciduous forest ecosystems common in the Great Lakes region. Objectives of the study were to test the validity of previously proposed SO42- adsorption indices, to examine within- and among-site variability in SO42- adsorption potential, and to investigate the effects of seasonal changes in soil solution chemistry on SO42- retention. Mineral soils were sampled by horizon at all sites, and soil solutions were sampled at lower E and lower B horizon boundaries at 10 sites. Proposed indices overpredicted sulfate adsorption in certain SO42- releasing subsurface horizons, seriously limiting the applicability of the published regression equations. We developed improved regression equations using the sum of initial extractable SO42- and additional SO42- adsorbed under laboratory conditions as the dependent variable. Sulfate retention indices predicted by the improved equations were independent of existing levels of extractable SO42- and past history of atmospheric SO42- deposition. Examination of within- and among-site variability in SO42- adsorption potentials suggested that soils need to be grouped tightly on a taxonomic basis for modelling purposes. Seasonal variation in soil solution SO42- concentrations and fluxes was consistent with an annual cycle of SO42- retention and release. Although seasonal patterns in SO42- concentrations and fluxes appeared to be controlled by hydrologic and S-cycling processes, the magnitude of SO42- fluxes was primarily related to atmospheric SO42- deposition rates.

Prior to the onset of blue-green algae, cohorts of Ceriodaphnia lacustris incubated at ambient epilimnion temperatures (27-30.degree. C) had higher individual somatic and population growth rates, an earlier age at first reproduction, and shorter life-spans than cohorts incubated at a constant 25.degree. C. As blue-green algae became abundant, Ceriodaphnia growth rates were reduced more dramatically at ambient temperatures than at 25.degree. C, suggesting that a temperature-resource interaction was important to determination of somatic growth rate, age of first reproduction, and population growth rate. Ceriodaphnia populations declined in Lake Texoma as blue-green algae became abundant. Diaphanosoma leuchtenbergianum, which was abundant throughout the period of blue-green algal dominance, did not show the temperature-resource interaction found for Ceriodaphnia. Temperature-resource interactions have been hypothesized to determine seasonal change in zooplankton community structure; this study provides experimental evidence of demographic consequences in natural populations of one kind of common temperature-resource interaction.																			0008-4301	1480-3283				AUG	1986	64	8					1739	1744		10.1139/z86-262	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z86-262													WOS:A1986E207300022

Correlations among measures were generally poor within days. However, good correlations were achieved among all methods on a seasonal basis. Seasonal correlations, in particular those between total particle numbers from particle counting and algal numbers from microscope, were affected by the degree of stability of the water column, with different relationships being found for mixed periods compared to stratified periods. These differences were related to an increased amount of particulate matter affecting the total particle numbers estimate during mixed periods. Other workers have found better relationships among these phytoplankton biomass methods within short periods, but there appears to be considerable variability among lakes. Therefore, it is recommended that the most appropriate method be evaluated on a individual lake basis, depending on the aims of the study.																			0018-8158					NOV 8	1991	226	1					1	15		10.1007/BF00007775	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00007775													WOS:A1991GX12700001

Gross and net primary productivity amounted to 470 and 163 g C m-2 y-1 respectively. A distinct seasonal variation was observed. Maxima occurred in March / April and September/October, whereas minima were found in July and from December to February. The peak in primary productivity during March and April took place after a period of deeper circulation by which nutrients from the upper part of the hypolimnion were mixed into the photic zone. The carbon budget of the lake is imbalanced since the autochthonous primary productivity does not deliver the amount of organic material necessary to match the heterotrophic processes. The missing quantity, which amounts to at least 110 kg C per day for the whole lake, is transported mainly by leaves and litter from the densely forested rims of the lake.

Nutrient additions increased seasonal mean total nitrogen concentrations by 145% and more than doubled the ratio of inorganic nitrogen to total phosphorus. Consistently higher seasonal mean chlorophyll a concentrations were not detected, but a significant increase in zooplankton density was detected during the period when juvenile coho salmon were absent (June-July), but not when juveniles were present (August-October) in the limnetic area of the lake. After treatment, a 25% average increase in the efficiency of Bear Lake to produce coho salmon smolt biomass was observed, and the composition of fingerlings that migrated as age-1 smolts increased by 30%. I believe the finding of no significant change in zooplankton density after nutrient treatment during August-October was due to expanded predation by juvenile coho salmon. From results of this nutrient enrichment experiment, it is clear that for a full understanding of trophic efficiency, further research is needed to integrate trophic-level dynamics with energy flow.																			0165-7836					AUG	1994	20	2-3					243	261		10.1016/0165-7836(94)90086-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0165-7836(94)90086-8													WOS:A1994PF18400010

Volvi, L. Mikri Prespa and L. Vegoritis), which differ significantly in morphometry, physical and chemical features. Chlorophytes constituted almost half of the phytoplankton species in the lakes Volvi (50.8%) and Vegoritis (47.3%) and contributed considerably (38.9%) to the phytoplankton of L.M. Prespa. Although rarely dominant, for they made up only a small part of the phytoplankton biomass (< 15%), they played an important role in the structure of the phytoplankton communities encountered in these lakes. In L. Volvi, desmids were much more abundant than in the other two lakes, where coccal green algae consisted the significant part of the chlorophyte biomass. Clear patterns of seasonality emerged for several green algae in the warm monomictic lakes Volvi and Vegoritis in contrast to the lack of periodicity for many of the chlorophytes in the unstably stratified, shallow lake M. Prespa.																			0006-3088					AUG	1994	49	4					593	603																WOS:A1994PM35100021

Population dynamics of a parasite Pallisentis in two species of fish Channa punctatus and Channa striatus	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												In an aquatic environment, there is a profound and inverse relationship between environment quality and disease status of fish. Parasites are one of the most serious limiting factors in aquaculture. Therefore, the present investigation has been undertaken to sort out the population dynamics of Pallisentis (Acanthocephala), in relation to host sex from freshwater fishes, Channa of Rohilkhand region. A total of 517 fishes (Channa punctatus, n = 198 and C. striatus, n = 319) were examined regularly from August 2006 to February 2010. Overall prevalence of Pallisentis in C. striatus was higher in females (67.78%) as compared to males (63.52%). In case of C. punctatus, overall prevalence of Pallisentis was higher in males (53.77%) as compared to females (52.17%) whereas, relative density was higher in females (61.41%) than in males (52.72%). Intensity (2-3 parasite/host, in both sexes), density (1.36 in males and 1.69 in females) and infection index (0.73 in males and 0.88 in females) were recorded.

However, the existing scientific knowledge of hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius) feeding behavior and ecology is far from comprehensive. This study aims to establish the carrying capacity of the "Mare aux Hippopotames", a protected area and Biosphere Reserve in Burkina Faso which hosts one of the major hippo populations of the country. We first investigated the availability of forage and the feeding habits of hippos in four pastures situated at different elevation with respect to the water and different distance from the lake; three of these pastures are used by hippos in the dry season while the fourth pasture located at higher elevation is used during the rainy season. We also estimated biomass and used this to assess the carrying capacity of the area for hippopotamus. Of the 44 plant species with significant biomass (e.g. a cover > 1%), 34 were eaten by hippos. Species consumed are Andropogon africanus, Andropogon ascinodis, Cyperus distans, Cyperus haspan, Aspilia bussei, Daniellia oliveri, Setaria barbata. The vegetation biomass in the pastures frequented by hippopotamus was 3.12 t/ha, resulting in a total average fresh biomass of 4617.6 t. The available biomass would allow to sustain a hippo population of 128 individuals, and factors other than food limitation arc likely to explain why the current hippo population remains at lower levels.																			0030-9923					MAR-APR	2012	44	2					433	442																WOS:000302000600020

C. The uptake rate constants for anthracene increased from 136 .+-. 22/h (n = 4, .hivin.X [mean] .+-. 1 SD) to 215 .+-. 45/h (n = 4) over the temperature range studied and were seasonally dependent. The depuration rate constant at the apparent optimum temperature of 7.degree. C was 0.015/h for anthracene. The biotransformation ability of P. hoyi was low and degradation of anthracene was undetectable even after exposures of 48 h. The bioconcentration factor was predicted from the uptake and depuration kinetics to be .apprx. 16,800 at 4.degree. C.

In off-shore sediments, about 50% of the mineralization is catalyzed through sulfate reduction, whereas denitrification only accounts for 1-5% of the total respiratory activity. The vertical distribution of the different microbial processes leading to the mineralization of organic matter can be explained as the result of competition for electron accepters and by the energetic yield of the different kinds of respiration processes. The relative quantitative importance of the different processes is explained by the availability of the different electron accepters. The influence of light, season, and spatial heterogeneity on the chemical and microbial zonation patterns in the sediment is demonstrated. Finally, the effect of sedimentary microbial processes, in particular denitrification and the reduction and oxidation of sulfur compounds, is discussed in terms of global element cycling.

They were dominated by the calanoid copepod, Calamoecia lucasi. Bosmina meridionalis occurred in all the lakes and Ceriodaphnia dubia in most. Small numbers of Macrocyclops albidus occurred. Rotifers were not studied in detail. Community composition was similar to that in other northern New Zealand lakes. No defined patterns of seasonal change were found and the timing of changes, which were of low magnitude, was different in each lake. Clutch sizes in all species were small. Calamoecia population parameters were analyzed using multivariate methods and shown to be related to lake trophic level. Population densities were higher in more productive lakes whereas breeding levels were inversely related to indices of trophic status and population abundance. It is suggested that the populations, as in other northern New Zealand lakes, are food-limited, probably as a consequence of a lake of marked climatic seasonality and the absence of major predation pressures. Groupings of the lakes based on the Calamoecia data are in general agreement with those derived from parallel studies of water chemistry, phytoplankton and macrobenthos.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1985	123	2					119	136		10.1007/BF00018974	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00018974													WOS:A1985AHD8100003

Its abundance changed significantly along the gradient and J. pelocarpus occurred most frequently on highly exposed shores. This distribution could result either because the species'' physiological optimum occurs on highly exposed shores or because J. pelocarpus is excluded from the less exposed and more densely vegetated part of the gradient by competition from other species of aquatic macrophytes. An attempt was made to distinguish between these 2 mechanisms by growing ramets of J. pelocarpus in the absence of neighbors (potential competitors) along the exposure gradient on a lakeshore. Biomass accumulated over 1 growing season varied with position on the gradient: maximum biomass was accumulated on shores of high exposure. The distribution of J. pelocarpus along the exposure gradient is apparently not determined primarily by interspecific competition.

The chief objective was to determine the major environmental factors affecting the swimming activity of Hirudo medicinalis L. because the latter will affect the feeding and growth periods. 841 leeches were caught in samples taken every 2 weeks in 1982, 1983 and 1984. 2. There were four major size groups, probably corresponding to year-classes. Only nine leeches were in their fourth year (Group IV), most leeches found on stones were in their first year (Group I) and most swimming leeches were in their second or third year (Groups II, and III). Size groups I-III overlapped considerably and could not be treated separately in subsequent analyses. 3. Water temperature appeared to be the dominant factor affecting swimming activity, the threshold for activity being 7.degree. C (range 5-9.degree. C). A curvilinear regression provided the best description of the relationship between temperature and catches of swimming leeches; 62% (range 50-75%) of the catch variation could be explained by temperature. 4. Atmospheric pressure at the time of sampling and its rate of change over 24 h preceding sampling had no significant effect on catches of swimming leeches, not even on the residuals of catches after the dominant effect of temperature had been removed. Similar analyses showed that there were no significant seasonal effects on swimming activity. 5. From a discussion of the implications of this study, it is concluded that the absence of the medicinal leech from many water bodies may be due partially to the relatively high temperatures required for swimming activity in a large proportion of the population (11.9.degree. C, 19.0.degree. C, 22.7.degree. C for 10%, 50%, 90% active respectively).																			0046-5070	1365-2427				JUN	1986	16	3					405	415		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1986.tb00981.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1986.tb00981.x													WOS:A1986C915200010

THE BOT RIVER, A CLOSED ESTUARY IN THE SOUTHWESTERN CAPE	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Although a considerable amount of work has been done on open estuaries in southern Africa very few studies have been on estuaries that are normally closed. The Bot River vlei is an estuary of this type, and the information presented here is the result of initial surveys carried out in 1980. The vlei, situated on the southwest coast of South Africa, has recently been opened to the sea. The salinity at the time of survey ranged from 7-12.permill., although this is subject to seasonal fluctuations and artificial opening of the estuary. The major primary producers are the reeds Phragmites and Scirpus which may reach a biomass of 1.794 and 0.961 kg dry mass m-2 and the aquatic macrophytes Potamogeton (0.071 kg m-2), Ruppia (0.371 kg m-2), Chara (0.071 kg m-2) and Cladophora (0.140 kg m-2) growing down to water depths of 2.9 m. The invertebrate fauna is poor broth in terms of biomass and diversity, but large numbers of birds, particularly herbivorous coots, and fish are found. The Bot River estuary appears to be in an intermediate stage of the evolution of coastal lakes from open estuaries.

Because the molybdate blue phosphate technique frequently overestimates phosphate concentrations, 3 radiochemical assays were used. One, involving sephadex fractionation, was unsatisfactory because of the long period required for high molecular weight P fractions to reach isotopic equilibrium. The 2nd method was unusable both for epilimnion waters within the Experimental Lakes Area, because of its low sensitivity, and for hypolimnion waters, due to interference from nonphosphate compounds. The 3rd method, Rigler''s bioassay, indicated that PO4-P in both lakes seldom exceeded 0.1 .mu.g.cntdot.l-1, even under anoxic conditions.

In July-Aug. a large population (up to 106 cells/ml) of green, photosynthetic, sulfur bacteria develops at the boundary of the oxidative and reductive zones of the water column lasting for 3-8 wk. These bacteria were isolated from the lake and identified as C. phaeobacteroides. Optimal growth conditions included 160 mg S= L-1 and light intensities of 5-30 .mu.Einstein (.mu.E) m-2s-1. Glucose and acetate augmented growth when added to the mineral medium. The lowest light intensity which still supported growth was 0.3 .mu.E m-2s-1 when acetate was present and 1.0 .mu.E m-2s-1 when no organic substrate was present. Under complete darkness, with or without organic substrate, the bacteria die. Photosynthetic activity was higher when no organic compound was added to the medium. Uptake of acetate was light-dependent. In the lake the photosynthetic activity of the bacteria is low because of the limited light intensity (0.3 .mu.E m-2s-1) at the bloom layer. The appearance and the disappearance of the bloom are probably caused by the influence of the daily internal seiche.																			0008-4166	1480-3275					1979	25	9					999	1007		10.1139/m79-154	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/m79-154								540269					WOS:A1979HN50700009
J	An, KG				An, KG			Determination of a limiting nutrient regulating algal biomass using in situ experiments of Nutrient Enrichment Bioassay (NEB) and empirical relations of nutrients and chlorophyll-a.	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												Long-term nutrient contents and nutrient ratios indicated that phosphorus was a potential limiting element for algal growth. In situ experiments of nutrient enrichment bioassay supported the evidence of P-limitation. However, regression analyses of log(10)-transformed chlorophyll-a (CHL) against TP (R-2 values < 0.25) showed that seasonal CHL was not closely related to flux of phosphorus during all seasons. Also, two dimensional graphical approach of Trophic State Index (TSI)showed that most values of TSI (CHL) -TSI (TP) and TSI (CHL) -TSI (SD) were less than zero, indicating factors other than phosphorus limited algal biomass (CHL -TP < 0), and that non-algal particles dominated light attenuation (CHL -SD < 0). The weak empirical relations and trophic deviations were explained well by the experiment of NEB-II that was conduced during a period of high inorganic turbidity. Overall results suggest that phosphorus is the primary element regulating the system productivity, but the system also were highly influenced by rapid flushing and high inorganic turbidity.

A total of 17,855 observations in 2,547 cows were utilized from 3 traditional management (MT=7,603) and three improved management (MM=10,252) farms at the Maracaibo Lake basin. Eight risk groups were analyzed: heifers, first-calf cows, adults, pregnant, dried, postpartum, and culled cows. Critical points of different risk factors, genetic, environmental, management, feeding, health, reproductive, and administrative were identified, as well as those related with different physiological status. Prediction variables for statistical risk occurrence were determined using a probability relation (OR, Odds Relation) with a 95% confidence level. Differences in risk factors and critical points between MT and MM were found. Significant risk factors (P<0.01) detected in heifers were: daily weights gain (OR=5.96, body condition (CC, OR=3.6) and reproductive tract scores (OR=3.14). Risk of organic anestrous in first calf cows (P<0.001) were: postpartum weight loss (OR=8.3), CC (OR=6.68), and presence of calf and suckling (OR=6.76). In repeat breeders cows risks are higher and more significant (P<0.001): racial predominance (OR=12), milk production (OR=8.13), insemination time (OR=14.2) and infections (OR=11.8); and to a lesser extend the herd effect (OR=5.68), estrus detection and service management (OR=6.62), mastitis (OR=3.75) (P<0.01), and (P<0.05): season (OR=3.48), CC (OR=3.8), placental retention (OR=5.22) and calving-first service interval (OR=6.43). These risk prediction variables confirm the diagnosis and also the probability that reproductive problems participate as causes. Management decisions utilized to prevent the risk of problems can better the reproductive efficiency but should be justified economically.																			0798-2259					JUL-AUG	2003	13	4					245	254																WOS:000184573500002

The study area, in the vicinity of the town of Mikolajki (Mazurian Lake District, Poland) comprised alderwood, pine wood, willow brushwood and ash thicket together with their boundaries. The CMR method was used to collect material .sbd. small rodents were captured in six 10-day trapping series, in various seasons from 1977 to 1979. A total of 1515 rodents were caught belonging to the following species: Clethrionomys glareolus, Microtus agrestis, Microtus oeconomus, Microtus arvalis, Apodemus flavicollis, Apodemus agrarius, Mus musculus, Sicista betulina. The species permanently inhabiting the given biotopes and the ones immigrating periodically were then distinguished, according to their places of capture. Two categories of rodents were also distinguished .sbd. those using one habitat only (one-habitat) and those using two or more habitats (multihabitat). The major differences between small rodent communities in the biotopes under study resulted from the share of the respective species in a given biotope, i.e. its position in the dominance structure and the length of time spent in the biotope. The study has revealed that diverse biotopes neighbouring in the same area account for enrichment if species composition in small rodent communities. The share of species immigrating seasonally from other biotopes depended on population density and the position of Clethrionomys glareolus, the species resident permanently throughout the study area, in the dominance structure.																			0001-7051	2190-3743				NOV	1987	32	11-20					229	244		10.4098/AT.arch.87-16	http://dx.doi.org/10.4098/AT.arch.87-16													WOS:A1987M399600004

In the seasonal distribution of two microorganisms, SRB were 1.07x10(3) similar to 2.42x10(5) cells/g-dry weight at Sanggulri, 2.40x10(5) similar to 1.29x10(6) at Dam and MPB were 0.52x10(3) similar to 5.88x10(3) cells/g-dry weight at Sanggulri and 1.44x10(3) similar to 6.89 x 10(3) at Dam. In these results, the density of SRB in Lake Soyang is much higher than other lakes. These high values might be due to higher sulfate concentration, 0.59 similar to 4.05 mM, than normal freshwater, 0.01 similar to 0.2 mM. And a good correlation of SRB and chlorophyll a concentration implied that the important environmental factor on distribution of SRB might be the concentration of available organic matter. In a comparison of sulfate-reducing rate and methane producting rate in 1995, the activity of SRB for the degradation of organic matter was higher than MPB by factor of 359. Conclusively SRB superior to MPB in the distribution and activity are more important anaerobic bacteria in Lake Soyang sediments.																			1225-8873					JUN	1996	34	2					131	136																WOS:A1996UU76300004

To better understand the physiological state of animals from temperate, naturally acidic systems, we compared metabolite stores and meristics of two yellow perch (Perca flavescens) populations in northern Wisconsin. One population originated from a naturally acidic, dystrophic lake (Acid-Lake-Perch, ALP) and had previously been shown to have enhanced tolerance to low pH. The second population came from two nearby interconnected circumneutral, mesotrophic lakes (Neutral-Lake-Perch, NLP). Perch were collected throughout the year to account for seasonal effects and to discern whether patterns of metabolite utilization differed between populations. ALP had smaller livers containing less glycogen and greater muscle glycogen content than NLP. The ALP also had significantly greater liver and visceral lipid contents, and females from this population committed a greater fraction of their body mass to egg production. We interpret these results as indicative of physiological divergence at the population level in yellow perch. These results are discussed as possible products of H+-driven changes in metabolism and as possible products of different life history strategies between populations. Our results also show that perch living in acidic, dystrophic Wharton Lake are not acid stressed.																			0706-652X					DEC	1992	49	12					2474	2482		10.1139/f92-273	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f92-273													WOS:A1992KL53200005

Many taxa are benthic and, therefore, they are closely related to sediments, accumulate metals and tolerate up to low-moderate concentrations. Average annual rate of the heavy metal accumulation in Myriophyllum verticillatum plant followed the order of Al>Fe> Mn>Zn>Ni>Cr>Cu>Pb>Cd. Al, Fe and Mn were deposited at a high percentage, but the plant could tolerate this level of values. In Dreissena polymorpha, annual rate of the heavy metal accumulation in the muscle tissues was found to be Al>Fe>Zn>Ni>Mn>Cr >Cu>Cd>Pb but Al> Fe>Mn>Zn>Ni>Cr in the shell part. Al, Fe and Mn were also accumulated at a high proportion in invertebrate organisms. The rate of heavy metals accumulated in Potamon fluviatilis was determined to be Al>Fe>Mn>Zn>Cu>Cr>Ni. However, a significant correlation was observed between certain heavy metals in each season, but no heavy metal concentration reached the toxic level for living organisms.

When the river is in its high season, between the months of May and July the low lands are flooded, uniting rivers and lakes. This phenomenon characterized as interfluves turns places that are of difficult access during dry season easily linked and united by the fluvial network. In this sense, the spatial dynamics modifies itself seasonally and the "ribeirinho", traditional inhabitants that lives by the rivers, is mobile living in the city or in the countryside, navigating through the rural-urban networks. This mobility characterizes both rural and urban spacialities making there distinction difficult. In order to analyse this relation the production of acai in Codajas, state of Amazonas. Analysing the acai of Codajas will show that the counties of Amazonas state, specially those with small cities can not be understood without the social relationship of production that are constructed in this interfluve city-countryside.

Almost all well-waters are used for consumption as drinking and irrigation water, especially during dry season. The wells are located around the Poopo Lake, situated in the central part of the Bolivian Altiplano (BA). The wells are mostly shallow and ontaminated by arsenic (As) and other trace metals from natural and anthropogenic sources. The north east side of the lake is a semiarid area where strong mining activities are carried out since last century. The west south side of the lake is an arid area where agricultural and cattle activities are carried out. Due the mining and geothermal sources, rivers, soils and some wells in the semiarid area are polluted by trace metals. Few rivers in the arid area are seasonally used for irrigation and become scarce or disappear before reaching the lake and many wells become dry as well. Detailed hydrochemical analyses of the well waters around the Poopo Lake reveal elevated As concentrations in almost all wells in the region.

IMPACT OF THE ATATURK DAM LAKE ON AGRO-METEOROLOGICAL ASPECTS OF THE SOUTHEASTERN ANATOLIA REGION USING REMOTE SENSING AND GIS ANALYSIS	XXII ISPRS CONGRESS, TECHNICAL COMMISSION VIII	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				22nd Congress of the International-Society-for-Photogrammetry-and-Remote-Sensing	AUG 25-SEP 01, 2012	Melbourne, AUSTRALIA	Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing, Hexagon, ESRI, RMIT Univ, Sch Math Geospatial Sci				The Ataturk Dam is the fourth largest clay-cored rock fill dam in the world. It was constructed on the Euphrates River located in semi-arid Southeastern Turkey in the 1980s as the central component of a large-scale regional development project for the Southeastern Anatolia region (referred to as GAP). The construction began in 1983 and was completed in 1990. The dam and the hydroelectric power plant, which went into service after filling up the reservoir was accomplished in 1992. The Ataturk Dam, which has a height of 169 m, a total storage capacity of 48.7 million m(3), and a surface area of about 817 km(2) plays an important role in the development of Turkey's energy and agriculture sectors. In this study, the spatial and temporal impacts of the Ataturk Dam on agro-meteorological aspects of the Southeastern Anatolia region have been investigated. Change detection and environmental impacts due to water-reserve changes in Ataturk Dam Lake have been determined and evaluated using multi-temporal Landsat satellite imageries and meteorological datasets within a period of 1984 to 2011. These time series have been evaluated for three time periods. Dam construction period constitutes the first part of the study. Land cover/use changes especially on agricultural fields under the Ataturk Dam Lake and its vicinity have been identified between the periods of 1984 to 1992. The second period comprises the 10-year period after the completion of filling up the reservoir in 1992. At this period, Landsat and meteorological time-series analyses are examined to assess the impact of the Ataturk Dam Lake on selected irrigated agricultural areas. For the last 9-year period from 2002 to 2011, the relationships between seasonal water-reserve changes and irrigated plains under changing climatic factors primarily driving vegetation activity (monthly, seasonal, and annual fluctuations of rainfall rate, air temperature, humidity) on the watershed have been investigated using a 30-year meteorological time series. For all images, geometric corrections including digital elevation information and Tasseled Cap transformations were carried out to attain changes in surface reflectance and denoting disturbance of Landsat reflectance data. Consequently, thematic maps of the affected areas were created by using appropriate visualization and classification techniques in conjunction with geographical information system. The resulting dataset was used in a linear trend analysis to characterize spatiotemporal patterns of vegetation-cover development. Analysis has been conducted in ecological units that have been determined by climate and land cover/use. Based on the results of the trend analysis and the primary factor analysis, selected parts of South-eastern Anatolia region are analyzed. The results showed that approximately 368 km2 of agricultural fields have been affected because of inundation due to the Ataturk Dam Lake. However, irrigated agricultural fields have been increased by 56.3% of the total area (1552 km2 of 2756km(2)) on Harran Plain within the period of 1984 -2011. This study presents an effective method for time-series analysis that can be used to regularly monitor irrigated fields in the Southeastern Anatolia region.

Lessons to Learn from 123 Years of Catch Data from a Small Scale Whitefish Fishery	BIOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT OF COREGONID FISHES - 2008	Advances in Limnology				10th Symposium on the Biology and Management of Coregonid Fishes	AUG, 2008	Winnipeg, CANADA					One hundred and twenty-three years (1885-2007) of catch statistics are available from the whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) seine-fishery in the River Tufsinga, an inlet to Lake Femund, Norway. We describe the fishery and discuss factors that might influence the variation in annual catches. The fishermen developed their own locally adapted seine method to capture whitefish migrating upstream towards spawning areas during October of each year. Fishing has been carried out in the same manner during the entire 123 years of the fishery, and the annual catch statistics have been recorded by the well-organized, small group of fishing rights owners, ensuring accountability in the data set. There was a substantial between-year variation in both total catch per season (0-13000 fish) and in catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE, 0-745 fish per day). Three factors seem to play a substantial role in shaping the variation in the annual catches. Based on autocorrelation analyses of CPUEs, variation in year class strength is a significant factor shaping CPUE variation. Based on the positive correlation between CPUEs in River Tufsinga and the CPUEs of River Whitefish in Lake Femund 8-10 years later, a stock-recruitment correlation exists between the number of spawners in the river and stock in the lake. Lastly, there was a tendency for low fishery CPUEs in years with high rainfall and higher CPUEs in dry years, supporting the impression by fishermen that water flow is a major factor determining their fishing success.					; Diserud, Ola H./NJS-8821-2025	Diserud, Ola Havard/0000-0002-7331-3230; 													1612-166X		978-3-510-47065-5				2012	63						371	382																WOS:000313086600025

Lower than normal lake levels in 2004 dewatered approximately 52,609 m(2), or an estimated 80% of the available rocky habitat in the lake (compared to the habitat available when at full pool). This rocky shoreline habitat is used for spawning by all three species of endemic Bear Lake coregonids: Prosopium spilonotus, P. gemmifer, and P. abyssicola. In October 2005, four rock reefs were constructed along the west side of Bear Lake in approximately 10 meters of water with the goal to enhance opportunities for spawning and recruitment of endemic coregonids, as well as provide a near shore fishing area for boat and ice anglers. We describe the procedures used to create the rock reefs and subsequent use of the reefs by endemic coregonids during 2006-2007. P. spilonotus used the reefs at more times of the year than P. gemmifer or P. abyssicola, but all three species used the rocks to some degree and especially during their respective spawning seasons. Although some of our results suggested the installation of the artificial reefs increased the preferred spawning habitat for endemic coregonids during drought, any future widespread installation of artificial reefs must also consider undesirable consequences, such as artificial reefs benefiting non-native species.																			1612-166X		978-3-510-47065-5				2012	63						535	+																WOS:000313086600034

The study on the aquatic ecosystem status and the reservoir zonation pattern are of great importance to the comprehensive management of the water source area. In this study, the ecological zonation based on the macroinvertebrate community, and the influencing factors to the macroinvertebrates were studied between July 2007 and May 2008. The results showed that Tubificidae, Naididae, and Chironomidae were dominating groups of the macroinvertebrate community in Danjiangkou Reservoir. The entire reservoir was divided into 4 zones based on the macroinvertebrate community type: the riverine zone (tributary zone), Hanjiang transitional zone, lacustrine zone and Danjiang transitional zone. The lacustrine zone appeared as the most stable zone with Tubifex community type. Hanjiang transitional zone and Danjiang transitional zone had the same community type, the mixed type of Tubificidae sp.l and Tubifex. The community structure was least stable in the riverine zone. Relative water column stability was the most important factor to the macroinvertebrates composition in the reservoir scale. But in the local scale, macroinvertebrates in the lacustrine zone was mainly influenced by the sediment organic matter; and the transitional zone was significantly affected by both sediment organic matter and water temperature. Water depth was a main factor affecting the seasonal changes of the macroinvertebrate community, significantly correlating with the standard deviation of Shannon-Wiener diversity index (r = -0.768, p = 0.001). It was also the main reason leading to the difference between the length of the lacustrine zone in Hanjiang and Danjiang River (35.5 km and 10 km, respectively). Therefore, due to the dissimilar properties in different zones, they should be treated separately as different sub-systems in the reservoir management.

This implies that energy was reallocated from photosynthesis to the uptake and assimilation of N. Stimulation in C uptake at low levels of NH4+ enrichment was followed by a progressive decline with further NH4+ enrichment. On other occasions when ambient NH4+ was undetectable, nutrient regeneration by zooplankton supplied a significant fraction of the required N. At these times and when the plankton had sufficient available N, there usually was no change in photosynthetic rate with either NH4+ or NO3- enirchment. Typically, little NO3- was taken up and no photosynthetic response was observed. On 2 occasions the uptake of NO3- was significant due to high NO3- and low NH4+ levels early in the season. At 1 of these times there was a reduction in photosynthesis with NO3- enrichment. A further complication was observed when photosynthesis decreased with NH4+ enrichment but increased with NO3- enrichment despite negligible NO3- uptake. The complex metabolism of these 2 N sources is not fully understood. AT optimum light intensity, C:N uptake ratios, even under NH4+ enrichment, are only sufficient to maintain the cellular C:N ratio unless much of the fixed C is respired or excreted. Apparently, photosynthesis and N uptake are not coupled. Photoinhibition of C uptake, but not N uptake was observed when low light adapted populations are exposed to high light conditions. The light intensity for maximum N uptake was slightly less than that for carbon. Dark N uptake was always near 50% of the maximum rate in the light whereas the C uptake was near 2% of Popt [optimum photosynthetic rate]. Certainly, there is an interconnection because dark C uptake was enhanced by NH4+ enrichment.

The efficiency of penetrating light utilization for the trophogenic water column ranged from 0.33-4.01% and was highest when cells in high concentrations were close to the surface. The lowest specific photosynthetic assimilation values were associated with the major bloom-forming dinoflagellate, Peridinium cinctum, which dominated the phytoplankton from Feb. to June. On all occasions, in situ photosynthetic efficiencies increased steadily with depth as light intensity decreased in the euphotic zone. The various types of light utilization efficiencies are defined.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1981	26	4					660	670		10.4319/lo.1981.26.4.0660	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1981.26.4.0660													WOS:A1981MB81000006

In Lake Jiloa, Nicaragua the depth distribution of these latter, nongrey, golden morphs shows dramatic seasonal variation. In the height of the dry season in Feb. over 50% of the gold morphs occur above 9 m, but as the breeding season approaches they migrate deeper such that less than 7% of the gold population occurs above 9 m at the onset of the breeding season. During the rainy season when breeding occurs most of the gold morphs occur below 15 m. Gold morphs voluntarily move into deeper water to breed rather than being aggressively forced deeper by larger, territorial grey morphs as was previously implied. Since the morphs of this species assortatively mate and select different habitats in which to breed, future sympatric splitting of this species is possible. Likely examples of sympatric speciation and of incipient speciation in the family Cichlidae are discussed.																			0378-1909	1573-5133					1980	5	1					75	78		10.1007/BF00000953	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00000953													WOS:A1980JH23500009

Although feeding thresholds were lowest in the blue light (400-490 nm), the rapid attentuation of this region in the lake meant that the depth limits of feeding in situ were determined by response to the green region (490-595 nm). Effects of changes in irradiance and light penetration on the depth of feeding are considered during a seasonal study. Increased sensitivity, as the juvenile stages develop, may be offset by reduced light penetration due to algal growth. Over an annual period the maximum feeding depth for pollan varied between 2.6 and 4.1 m. In the juvenile stages of 2 other predatory species from the lake, perch, Perca fluviatilis, and pike, Esox lucius, the corresponding ranges were 1.1-1.9 m and 2.7-4.6 m, respectively.

J	PRICE, SD; BARRETT, SCH				PRICE, SD; BARRETT, SCH			THE FUNCTION AND ADAPTIVE SIGNIFICANCE OF TRISTYLY IN PONTEDERIA-CORDATA L (PONTEDERIACEAE)	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY												Darwin proposed that the adaptive significance of tristyly is to promote insect-mediated pollination among floral morphs with anthers and stigmas at equivalent levels legitimate pollination. Strong pollen trimorphism in P. cordata enables an evaluation of this hypothesis. In an investigation of pollen flow patterns in different parts of the North American range of the species, legitimate pollination of some morphs was observed in all but one population investigated. At only one site (Ft. McCoy, Florida [USA]) was Darwin''s hypothesis confirmed for the 3 floral morphs. The long-styled morph most frequently exhibited legitimate pollination, the mid-styled morph was intermediate and the short-styled morph rarely experienced legitimate pollination. Temporal variation in pollen flow was observed during the flowering season of P. cordata. Total stigmatic pollen loads decreased as the density of inflorescences and activity of pollinators declined. In spite of variable total loads the legitimate component was relatively constant in the long- and mid-styled forms; in the short-styled form this measure increased as the season progressed. Little variation was detected between stigmatic samples collected at different times during a single day. Legitimate pollination may be inhibited by local foraging in pollinators and the spatial segregation of floral morphs. At Paugh Lake (Ontario [Canada]) over 75% of all bumble bee flights are among the 5 nearest neighbors of a particular inflorescence. In the same population, there is a probability of over 70% that the nearest 3 neighbors of an inflorescence are of the same floral morph. Despite these influences, legitimate pollination occurs in P. cordata, suggesting substantial pollen carryover.

R and S. and Juncus pelocarpus forma submersus Fassett, two rhizomatous perennial plants which occur in the littoral zones of many temperature oligotrophic lakes. Reciprocal replacement series experiments were established in Roach Lake, U.S.A., at 4 ratios and 3 densities during the 1982 and 1983 growing seasons. Changes in biomass and in a variety of morphological characters were measured. Although the species did not differ in biomass change, Eleocharis produced more rosettes, longer rhizomes and more new photosynthetic structures in the first season than did Juncus. Effects of neighbors, regardless of species, were more imporant than interspecific interactions. Growth interactions between these species were competitively neutral. Differences between Eleocharis and Juncus growth dynamics lead to contrasting clonal structures that facilitate coexistence. The results would not have been interpretable without detailed, plant-by-plant morphological data. Such detailed structural analysis may be essential in studies of interspecific interactions among macrophytes.

Extinction coefficients for photosynthetically active radiation (350-750 nm) varied from 0.2-3.3 ln units .cntdot. m-1, the euphotic zone (1% of light energy at surface) ranged from 1.7-11 m. Specific extinction coefficients of chlorophyll, kc (ln units .cntdot. mg-1 .cntdot. m-2), and water kw (ln units .cntdot. m-1) were dependent on the wavelength at which they were measured (at 650 nm, kc = 0.011, kw = 0.693; for 350-750 nm, kc = 0.007, kw = 0.489). High concentrations of chlorophyll and other cell pigments during the annual Peridinium bloom strongly attenuated light penetrance and caused a spectral shift toward the red to give elevated quantum to joule (Q:W) ratios (2.96 .times. 1018).																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1979	24	4					652	663		10.4319/lo.1979.24.4.0652	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1979.24.4.0652													WOS:A1979HE93200006

The seasonal distribution of the compounds reflected the circulation in the lake and was compatible with the assumption derived from laboratory studies that mass transfer to the atmosphere was the predominant elimination mechanism. A mass balance for 1,4-dichlorobenzene was established for the central basin of the lake; an average residence time of approximately 5 mo. was found. By applying a simple steady state model, an average annual mass transfer coefficient of 1 cm/h was obtained for the transport of 1,4-dichlorobenzene and tetrachloroethylene from the lake to the atmosphere.

Microbiological and Isotopic Geochemical Research in the Arid Steppe Lakes and Sor Solonchaks of Western Transbaikalia	MICROBIOLOGY												The rates of microbial processes in the sor solonchaks and the silts of the Western Transbaikalean saline lakes were investigated. The rate of deep CO2 fixation in the silt of Lake Beloe was as high as 0.19 mg C dm(-3) day(-1). The content of cellulose and protein in the sor solonchaks (for air-dry material) were up to 5.0 and 0.42 mg g(-1), respectively. The rates of cellulose decomposition and proteolysis in the silt were 1.08 and 0.96 % day(-1), respectively. Sulfate reduction (up to 1.82 mg S dm(-3) day(-1)) prevails at the terminal stages of anaerobic decomposition of organic matter in the silt. During the flooding period, methanogenesis producing isotopically light CH4 probably prevails in the sor solonchaks and arid soils of the region. This suggestion is supported by the surface foaming of the local arid soils after abundant monsoon rains, an increase in the delta C-13 value for soil carbonates to -5.94% along the solonchak profile, and a decrease in the delta C-13 value for the soil carbonates formed by methane-oxidizing bacteria to -11.41%. The seasonal peaks of isotopically heavier (to -16.60%) organic matter in the bottom sediments of the lake may be explained as the result of activity of heterotrophic sulfate reducers, which exhibited the highest growth rates at the peak sulfate concentrations in the silt.																			0026-2617					DEC	2011	80	6					857	866		10.1134/S0026261711050031	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0026261711050031													WOS:000300215300015

LARVAL SUCKER DISTRIBUTION AND CONDITION BEFORE AND AFTER LARGE-SCALE RESTORATION AT THE WILLIAMSON RIVER DELTA, UPPER KLAMATH LAKE, OREGON	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST												We monitored the response of endangered Lost River sucker (Deltistes luxatus) larvae and shortnose sucker (Chasmistes brevirostris) larvae prior to, and during the first 2 seasons after, restoration of historic wetlands at the mouth of the Williamson Rivet; Upper Klamath Lake, Oregon. In 2006 and 2007 (prerestoration) and in 2009 and 2010 (postrestoration), we used pop nets set in shallow-water (<1-m-deep) wetland habitats to document the distribution and condition of larval fish throughout the Williamson River Delta Preserve, as well as at a reference site along the Goose Bay shoreline in Upper Klamath Lake. From prerestoration to postrestoration, we witnessed significant declines in abundance of larval suckers at the reference site along the Goose Bay shoreline but no similarly significant declines in the 2 pilot restoration projects (t = 9.92, df = 400, P < 0.0001; t = 0.8, df = 400, P = 0.3438). In 2009 and 2010, larvae were documented using the newly restored portions of the delta. Larval suckers captured during pre- and postrestoration in the pilot areas and during postrestoration in the restored areas of the preserve were more likely to have fuller guts than larvae captured at the reference site along the Goose Bay shoreline. Throughout the study, length trends were more variable than gut fullness trends: larvae captured in pilot areas prior to restoration were larger than those captured after restoration, and larvae captured at the reference site postrestoration were on average larger than postrestoration sucker larvae from the restored and pilot areas.

Arsenic is largely associated with ferric iron in the form of oxyhydroxides in oxic waters and sediments as arsenate As(V). In deeper anaerobic sediments arsenic is released from iron oxyhydroxides because of the reduction of iron from the ferric to the more soluble ferrous state. Reducing environments can also be encountered in sediments relatively close to the sediment-water interface when there are high rates of biological activity that consume oxygen and create a reducing environment. For the past several years we have examined the relationships between organic carbon content of surface sediments, bottom water anoxia, redox zonation of sediments and the release of arsenic from freshwater sediments to the overlying waters. These studies have been performed using limnocorrals to isolate columns of water and their underlying sediments in Balmer Lake, a shallow freshwater system in Central Canada that has served as the final repository for tailings from two gold mines for more than 40 years. Our results indicate that surface sediments with higher organic carbon content are more susceptible to developing late season bottom water anoxia that can facilitate the subsequent release of arsenic from sediments to the overlying water. These results have implications for metal mining operations where reduced metal loadings from effluents or mine closure are expected to result in higher biological productivity and greater organic matter deposition to sediments.					; Palace, Vince/AHB-6708-2022	Palace, Vince/0000-0003-2134-2299; 													1155-4339					MAY	2003	107		2				1005	1008		10.1051/jp4:20030468	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/jp4:20030468													WOS:000183782500066
J	FREMPONG, E				FREMPONG, E			DIEL ASPECTS OF THE THERMAL STRUCTURE AND ENERGY BUDGET OF A SMALL ENGLISH LAKE	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												The diel response of the thermal structure of Esthwaite Water to prevailing meteorological conditons was analyzed for 7 selected days, covering different phases of stratification. Meterological measurements were combined with published empirical relations to compute 24-h thermal energy budgets for 2 days. Amplitudes of diel changes were controlled by the seasonal phase of stratification and the mgnitude of incident solar radiation. Heat storage usually followed a sinusoidal curve with a minimum during the night and early morning and a maximum during the late afternoon. Wind-induced turbulent mixing, and ventral circulation induced by nocturnal cooling of the surface water through evaporative and conductive processes, also modified depth-time trends in thermal structure. The budget accounted for almost all the thermal energy exchanges of the lake. Possible sources of a slight imbalance are considered. Although there was a positive daily surplus of net radiation, it may not always imply heat gain by the lake as it may be counter-balanced by heat losses through fluxes of latent and sensible heat. Net back-radiation was a major component of daily heat loss. The combined latent and sensible heat fluxes also accounted for a high proportion of heat loss to the atmosphere. Net flow of sensible heat to the lake was small but not always inappreciable. Net daily heat storage represented 26% (May 9th) and 13% (June 17th) of solar radiaton input. Advected energy due to lake inflow and outflow was negligible. Qualitative comparisons are made with long-term (seasonal and annual) energy budgets and heat fluxes.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1983	13	1					89	102		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1983.tb00660.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1983.tb00660.x													WOS:A1983QC56700008

In 1979 the colony consisted of .apprx. 2400 nesting pairs, with a total of 99 nests containing 5-7 eggs (superclutches). In 1980 the colony had increased in size to 2600 nests and contained a total of 71 superclutches. The difficulty is discussed of distinguishing nests in which superclutches have been laid by female-female pairs from single-cup nests used by polygynous groups or from nests receiving dump eggs. Nests containing superclutches were larger than those containing normal-sized clutches. They were not differentially located by substrate, nest density or location within the colony. Nearest-neighbor distance was also similar for the 2 clutch types. Eggs laid in superclutches were slightly smaller than those from normal-sized clutches (1-4 eggs) but did not differ in shape. Significantly more eggs from superclutches rolled from the nest or were destroyed or abandoned than from normal-sized clutches. The proportion of nests that hatched at least 1 chick did not differ significantly between the 2 clutch types. Hatching success for superclutches was 34% in 1979 and 30% in 1980; for normal-sized clutches it was 77% in 1979 and 61% in 1980. Chicks from superclutches had a higher rate of mortality during the week following hatching than did chicks from normal-sized clutches. Chicks from the former hatched at significantly lighter weights than did those from the latter during both years of study, but their weights did not differ after the 1st week posthatch. Tarsal and culmen measurements followed a similar pattern to that of weight. Chicks from normal-sized clutches had a significantly higher fledging success than did those from superclutches. The reproductive success of 4 polygynous groups is also reported.																				1938-4254					1983	100	3					658	669		10.1093/auk/100.3.658	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/auk/100.3.658													WOS:A1983RG17600013

J	RITCHIE, JC				RITCHIE, JC			LATE-QUATERNARY VEGETATIONAL HISTORY OF WESTERN INTERIOR OF CANADA	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												The late-Wisconsinan pollen stratigraphy of the Western Interior of Canada is assembled and 16 representative sites provide a basis for establishing trends of vegetation history. Sites in the southern, prairie region show an early Picea-Artemisia assemblage (12 .times. 103 to 10 .times. 103) replaced by a zone dominated by herb pollen. Similarly, sites in the Aspen Parkland and Transitional zones all have the Picea-Artemisia zone from as early as 13.9 .times. 103 to 10 .times. 103, followed by a herb zone. It is replaced by an arboreal pollen zone at 4.5 .times. 103 to 3 .times. 103 B.P. While there is a broad trend common to all sites in the modern boreal forest, from an early spruce-dominated assemblage to a late postglacial spruce-pine-birch assemblage identical with modern spectra, there are differences in the details of stratigraphy. Two sites in central Alberta have a poplar zone preceding the early spruce zone. Sites near the modern southern forest boundary show a late development (3 .times. 103 B.P.) of the mixed boreal forest from prairie and hardwood deciduous forest communities. One site, at Flin Flon, Saskatchewan, provides clear evidence for a treeless episode (Artemisia-grass-sedge) preceding the spruce zone. As the late-Wisconsinan glacial ended, an early version of the boreal forest, dominated by spruce and lacking pine, spread from adjacent USA on to deglaciated surfaces and till over stagnant ice. It persisted in the southern part of the area until about 10 .times. 103 and until 6 .times. 103 in the northernmost portions. In the south the spruce forest was replaced directly by prairie, spreading from the southwest and extending farther north than its modern limit between 7.5 .times. 103 and 6 .times. 103. All remnants of ice sheets and glacial lakes had disappeared by about 7 .times. 103 and the northern part of the area was occupied by a boreal forest undergoing rapid changes in composition from the early spruce-dominated version to the mixed spruce-pine-birch-poplar mosaic prevalent today. Pine probably spread from western refugia, at least into areas north and west of Lake Winnipeg. At about 3 .times. 103 the southern limit of the forest extended to the south, apparently in response to a climate with cooler and (or) wetter growing seasons. The rapid replacement of the spruce-dominated boreal forest by grasslands in the early postglacial was probably a response to warmer and drier growing seasons.																			0008-4026						1976	54	15					1793	1818		10.1139/b76-194	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b76-194													WOS:A1976CC63700009

Estimates were made based on lake wide sampling on a single occasion. Sediments contained most zinc with 4.2 x 10(5) kg. Of this 11 +/- 4% was gut soluble (pepsin released). Water contained the second largest store at the time of sampling with 597 kg of zinc. Estimated lakewide stores of zinc in fish (Cyprinus carpio) macrophytes (mostly Typha orientalis), zooplankton and macroinvertebrates were 144 kg, 1.4 kg, 0. 55 kg and 0. 14 kg zinc, respectively. Zinc stores in the water and biota will exhibit large changes depending on rainfall and seasonal growth but they will still be small relative to the amounts held in sediments. Comparison of zinc concentrations in surface sediments (561 +/- 81 mg/kg) and water (0.018 +/- 0.002 mg/kg) with those before remedial works were performed in 1974 to control a metal contamination source upstream at Captain's Flat show that there has been a reduction in the levels of zinc recorded in the lake (pre-1974 sediment, 1109-1670 mg/kg; water, 0.1 mg/kg). Concentrations of zinc in lake water were well below those reported to be toxic to phytoplankton, zooplankton and fish or to cause degeneration of gill structures. Levels of zinc in fish are below the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council's recommended maximum levels for human consumption. Examination of the oxygen status of Lake Burley Griffin indicates that zinc release from lake sediments under reducing conditions is unlikely to be a potential problem. The major source of zinc to the lake is considered still to be from the mine waste polluted Molonglo River with little contribution from other creeks in the catchment.

J	AMIN, OM				AMIN, OM			THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SIZE OF SOME SALMONID FISHES AND THE INTENSITY OF THEIR ACANTHOCEPHALAN INFECTIONS	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Of the complex factors affecting the abundance of acanthocephalan infections in their definitive fish hosts, those related to fish age are considered. In Lake Michigan [USA], the abundance of some 8000 worms, mostly Echinorhynchus salmonis (Mueller, 1784), was independent of the age (weight) of coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch (Walbaum), chinook salmon. O. tshawytscha (Walbaum), and lake trout, Salvelinus namaycush (Walbaum), using linear regression analysis. Other E. salmonis infection patterns include steady increase in abundance with host age and a maximal increase in midage. A decrease in abundance with host age was demonstrated in other acanthocephalan species. These patterns were primarily related to host feeding behavior and spatial and seasonal distribution of invertebrate and vertebrate larval hosts. A progressive increase in the abundance of Echinorhynchus through midage or through life is associated with a stable intake of an invertebrate diet, including the infected intermediate host, in larger volumes by older fish. Loss of the latter 2 patterns is affected by destabilizing the above trend through total or partial replacement of the invertebrate diet with a piscivorous one.																			0008-4301	1480-3283					1985	63	4					924	927		10.1139/z85-137	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z85-137													WOS:A1985AJG1500030

Durations decreased monotonically with temperature over the thermal tolerance range and are described using Belehradek''s equation. The present data are compared with other observations on rate-temperature responses of warm-water and temperate zooplankton. Small, but ecologically significant, differences are discerned.

Within the scope of the projekt, ''Ecosystem Research in the Vicinity of Bornhoeveder chain of lakes'', the seasonal dynamics of phytomass and nutrients of extensively used Ranunculo-Alopecuretum stands were observed with respect to the possibility of regeneration to species-rich wet meadows. Floristic observations revealed that throughout a period of five years with annual hay-making without fertilization, no characteristic species of wet meadows have established themselves. This indicates that the environmental conditions have not effectively changed yet. The high production of above-ground stand phytomass indicates yet a good availability of nutrients, especially of nitrogen. The dynamics of nitrogen yield in the above-ground phytomass showed that in order to achieve an efficient impoverishment of soil nutrients, it is necessary to cut the vegetation at least twice a year. Additionally, this management practice interferes positively with the structure of the plant composition. The success of restoration moreover depends on the biotic potential (recent vegetation, neighbouring vegetation, seed bank). In the investigated vegetation types the seed bank contains no characteristic species of wet meadows. Therefor apart from suitable management practices. a successful restoration of species-poor Ranunculo-Alopecuretum requires much more time.																			0367-2530	1618-0585				MAR	1994	189	1					37	50																WOS:A1994NG32500003
J	FLOWER, RJ				FLOWER, RJ			SEASONAL-CHANGES IN SEDIMENTING MATERIAL COLLECTED BY HIGH ASPECT RATIO SEDIMENT TRAPS OPERATED IN A HOLOMICTIC EUTROPHIC LAKE	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Cylindrical sediment traps with an aspect ratio (height (60 cm): diameter (5.1 cm)) of 11.8 were located 1 m above the surface sediment by a rigid metal framework support. Traps were exposed in Lough Neagh for one year, from May 1978. Each trap collected between 11 and 12 cm of faintly laminated sediment. One 12 cm sediment column was examined using conventional palaeolimnological techniques of core extrusion and analysis. The algal record in trapped sediment is shown to correspond with successional changes in phytoplankton abundance in the lake during the year of study. The sediment accumulation rate measured by the traps is an order of magnitude greater than that measured in dated sediment cores and redeposited and inwashed sediment formed the bulk of trapped material. However, the value of these high aspect ratio traps is that they provide a continuous but qualitative account of compositional changes in sedimenting material through time. Their potential as long term biological monitoring devices is emphasized.																			0018-8158					MAY 31	1991	214						311	316		10.1007/BF00050965	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00050965													WOS:A1991FX93500041
J	Childress, RB; Bennun, LA				Childress, RB; Bennun, LA			Effect of breeding timing on White-breasted Cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo) reproductive success at a seasonally constant Kenyan lake	OSTRICH												White-breasted Cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo) breeding timing and reproductive success were documented in 1995 and 1996 at Lake Naivasha, Kenya (0degrees49'S), considered to be seasonally constant. In both years, pairs breeding earlier fledged significantly more chicks per breeding attempt than pairs breeding later. Smaller brood sizes later in the season were responsible for 81% of the difference; nestling loss represented 19%. Sixty-three percent of the total nestlings lost were from the nests of pairs breeding late in the season. Starvation appeared to be the primary cause of nestling loss, but there was no evidence of a consistent seasonal decline in prey availability. Neither predation nor sibling aggression appeared to be a major factor, although the reproductive success of late-breeders was almost certainly reduced by conspecific interference from fledglings of early-breeding pairs. The likeliest explanation for the seasonal decline is that older, more experienced (and therefore more successful) birds tend to breed early in the season.																			0030-6525					MAR	2003	74	1-2					102	109		10.2989/00306520309485375	http://dx.doi.org/10.2989/00306520309485375													WOS:000224347800013
J	COATES, D				COATES, D			BIOLOGY OF FORK-TAILED CATFISHES FROM THE SEPIK RIVER, PAPUA-NEW-GUINEA	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Ariids accounted for approximately 25% of the weight of catches and landings from rivers and lakes in the floodplain region (= 50% weight of native species). Habitat preferences were: A. solidus, lakes and rivers; A. utarus, rivers and occasionally lakes; A. coatesi and A. velutinus, rivers only; A. nox, lakes and floodplain. A. solidus and A. utarus occasionally entered the floodplain but only A. nox exhibited any, albeit modest, affinity for this environment. In general, the fishes showed no marked seasonality relating to the flood cycle: in four species slight increases in feeding, condition, breeding and fat deposition occurred during the dry season whilst only A. nox showed modest increases in these parameters during the flood season due to its increased feeding on the floodplain at that time. All species are omnivorous but diets differed according to morphology and habitat preferences. Diet overlap was greatest amongst A. coatesi, A. solidus and A. utarus which fed mainly on prawns and a variety of other plant and animal matter. A. nox is a specialised filter-feeder consuming mainly small crustaceans and small insect larvae. A. velutinus fed mainly on large insect larvae and emergent and terrestrial insects and its diet excluded prawns. A. solidus and, especially, A. utarus also fed on fish scales. Feeding commenced immediately after hatching while free embryos were still in the male parent's mouth. Large amounts of fat were stored prior to brooding during which time males fast. The reproductive style of ariid catfishes limits their colonisation of the floodplain and is a constraint to increased fisheries exploitation of the stocks. The importance of ariids to the local fishery and nutrition (fat) for the local people should be recognised.																			0378-1909					MAY	1991	31	1					55	74		10.1007/BF00002159	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00002159													WOS:A1991FN53800008

Periphyton biomass (ash-free dry weight (AFDW) and total chlorophyll (Chl)) and accumulation rates (milligrams AFDW/s m2 per day) were among the lowest recorded from temperate oligotrophic lakes, averaging 0.01-5.69 mg Chl .cntdot. m-2, 0.04-2.86 g AFDW .cntdot. m-2, and 1-47 mg AFDW .cntdot. m-2 per day. Diatoms were the dominant group in most lakes at most times, comprising over 70% of total periphyton biomass. Achnanthes minutissima and Tabellaria flocculosa were the most ubiquitous species in the study, and Eunotia spp. were common only in acidic humic-stained lakes. Of the physical and chemical factors measured in this study, pH appeared the most important in regulating diatom species composition. In those lakes fertilized with N and P, periphyton biomass showed marked increases over untreated years, but the community species composition in most lakes remained similar between treated and untreated years. Comparisons between artificial and natural substrates showed that the same species were common on both substrates, although relative abundances varied. The littoral zone of most study lakes is small relative to the pelagic, and it is estimated that periphyton comprised .ltoreq. 1% of average total algal biomass (as chlorophyll) and also represented < 1% of estimated total annual C metabolism.																			0008-4026						1984	62	5					1022	1031		10.1139/b84-141	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b84-141													WOS:A1984SU75200016

(Fabaceae) in Uganda and its relationship to climatic factors	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The aim of the study was to map the distribution of Acacia senegal and its infraspecific taxa in Uganda and predict its suitable range of occurrence based on climatic factors. The distribution of the infraspecific taxa was analysed for richness, diversity, turnover and reserve selection. Regression analysis was performed to understand the relationship between distribution of the species and climatic variables. Georeferenced species occurrence points were superimposed over temperature and vapour maps. Areas with highest taxa richness, diversity and turnover were mapped and found in the Lake Kyoga basin. The species shows preference for the northern region of the study area with dissimilar climatic pattern from the southern region and the superimposition supported findings. Variety kerensis exhibited narrower climatic, altitudinal and distribution range preference. Temperature seasonality, maximum temperature of warmest month, temperature annual range, mean temperatures of warmest and driest quarters had the highest coefficients of determination (r(2) > 0.7) hence most important in influencing species distribution. The most appropriate locations for in situ conservation and for germplasm collection to ensure maximum diversity is secured are found in Wabisi-Wajala, Kiula, Kyalubanga, Bajo, Kasagala, Kabwika-mujwalanganda, Maruzi, Moroto and Napak Central Forest Reserves.

Voles were censused over three breeding periods in 1980 to 1982 on three 4-ha grides in different habitat types. The home ranges of females were exclusive at low density but overlapped slightly at high density and home range size was larger in the coniferous habitat than in deciduous vegetation. Sexually mature females, once settled on a home range, appeared to show only minor shifts. Further, the home range size of females was not a function of density. In 1982 in deciduous habitat the number of mature females remained constant for the last six weeks of the breeding season at the density predicted from home range size and effective sampling area of the grid. Spacing behaviour appeared to limit the breeding density of females in this species. However, in order to test this, experiments will have to be performed.																			0003-455X	1797-2450					1986	23	3					261	267																WOS:A1986E857700001

Regardless of season the lake water constituents were largely resistant to microbial attack during the 3 mo. incubation period in 4 of 5 experiments as shown by DOC measurements. Refractory macromolecules and oligomers depressed growth of bacteria as established by the microcolony method. Less persistent macromolecules found in one of the experiments consisted of minor constituents which were utilized by various bacteria and a remainder which was decomposed only by specialists forming characteristic microcolonies. Accompanying oligomers consisted of 40%-50% of readily degradable substances and of a remainder, which was inaccessible to the major part of the bacteria.																			0003-9136						1983	99	1					60	79																WOS:A1983RV15300004

Functional responses of mysids to changes in the density of 2 species of calanoid copepod prey were curvilinear in laboratory experiments. In the field and in 2-prey treatments, preference was usually positive for Epischura and negative for Diaptomus. The preference for Epischura was greatest at the lowest combined densities of prey in the laboratory and decreased at densities > 100 Epischura/m3 in the field. Several hypotheses to explain the inverse relationship between selectivity and prey density are discussed. Field assemblages of prey vary vertically, horizontally and seasonally. Potential effects of this heterogeneity on both predator and prey populations are examined.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1982	93	1-2					133	143		10.1007/BF00008106	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008106													WOS:A1982PH64800015

The three sites are situated on a nutrient and water content gradient from a relatively nutrient rich alder forst near the lake, a mixed forest on the slope, and a nutrient poor beech forest on the top of the hill. Litter decomposition rates decrease in the same gradient. Successive communities were well differentiated for the oribatid mites in the beech forest throughout the three years. The seasonal variation plays a minor role for the successive communities. It is of higher importance for the collembola than for the oribatida. The successive occurrence of common soil fauna species differ between the three sites. Species occurred earlier in the alder forest than in the beech forest. Highest differences were found for species typical for late litter decomposition stages.																					3-437-25058-2				1996							275	282																WOS:000075264500038

Changes in phytoplankton biovolume were investigated. Rotifer densities became significantly higher in the 'micro' treatment than in the 'complete' and 'none' treatments. Total algal biovolume changed little in the 'complete' and 'none' treatments, but increased significantly in the 'micro' treatment. The results suggest that macrozooplankton (Daphnia magna) suppressed it and microzooplankton (Keratella cochlearis) enhanced it. They had opposite net effects on the phytoplankton. Suppression of microzooplankton by Daphnia probably had an indirect negative effect on the phytoplankton.

Juss), in the Conventional Lake Chad Basin (CLCB) extending across parts of Niger, Nigeria, Chad and Cameroon since its appearance in the sub-region in 1972. Although the scale was first officially reported in Garoua, Northern Cameroon only in 1985, it has since spread over 1 million square kilometers in the CLCB area and destroyed many neem and other economic trees. This paper highlights the implications of the biology and ecology of this scale pest for its successful control and the need for a proper understanding of the role of meteorological factors in seasonal variations of populations of the scale. It further proposes an integrated pest management scheme involving the augmentation of indigenous predators/parasitoids, controlled pruning of infested branches as well as the destruction of heavily infested whole trees, the development and planting of neem varieties that are resistant to the scale and the selective application of approved systemic insecticides, for the effective control of the scale in the sub-region.

The results of the phytoplankton analysis are presented from Basin A, the acidified basin, and Basin B, the control, two years before the acidification started and two years during the acidification. In Basin B, the control basin, the succession of the main groups of phytoplankton throughout the growth season remained almost identical from year to year in the investigation period. The development of the phytoplankton was almost the same in the two basins before the acidification started. The results from the acidified Basin A in 1991 and 1992 show marked changes and an almost immediate response in the phytoplankton composition and percentage of the main algae groups, compared to the reference basin. The percentage of the green algae decreased, especially the species Oocystis submarina v. variabilis, while the dinoflagellate Peridinium inconspicuum and the cryptomonads increased in number and percentage of the total volume in the acidified basin. The total volume and the primary production measurements show an increase in Basin A compared to the control in the first year of acidification treatment (1991), but a decrease in the next year.																			0160-4120						1994	20	3					313	319		10.1016/0160-4120(94)90115-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0160-4120(94)90115-5													WOS:A1994NM12900007

In Ubolratana reservoir, Thailand, it feeds selectively on larger zooplankters, especially Cladocera and to a lesser extent on Copepoda. Other zooplankters are also consumed together with both living and dead insects and occasionally its own young. It feeds during the day. Our results indicate that the slight seasonal differences in food consumed probably reflects differences in availability at different seasons and sites. The fish grows in weight, as expected, at a higher rate than the cube of its length. The condition factor is the same for males and females and shows some seasonal variation. Data on fecundity and gonadosomatic index mark this fish as highly fecund and a year-round spawner. Its short life span, favourable growth and high fecundity make it a valuable source of cheap protein.

Changes in weekly wet atmospheric N and P were measured from 2005 to 2008 at monitoring stations located 0.8, 7.9, and 10.3 km downwind from a new chicken egg production facility on the Albemarle Peninsula, North Carolina. After this farm began operating, there was a significant doubling in mean wet NH4 (+) concentrations (465-1,022 mu g l(-1)) at 0.8 km with no change at the other sites. To measure the phytoplankton responses to nutrient enrichment, we conducted seasonal N and P enrichment bioassays from 2006 to 2008 on nearby Phelps Lake and Alligator River. These low-nutrient waters responded to nutrient additions, with the highest increases in phytoplankton primary productivity (C-14 uptake) and biomass (chlorophyll a) occurring in the combined N and P treatments suggesting co-limitation of N and P. Although we did not find an increased nutrient signal in precipitation at sites > 0.8 km from the farm, there is the potential for atmospheric deposition of N to these and other waters located N/NE of the farm given prevailing winds and distance that NH4 (+) aerosols can travel. Furthermore, surface runoff from the farm may impact receiving waters downstream (e.g., Pungo and Pamlico Rivers). In order to prevent excessive phytoplankton productivity and biomass both N and P inputs should be carefully assessed and potentially controlled in these nutrient-sensitive waters.

For the time being, ecosystems of water bodies of the Chernobyl NPP exclusion zone continue to suffer from heavy radioactive contamination. dictating, thus, the need to carry out further research works within the framework of comprehensive regional radioecological monitoring. Particular features of radionuclide accumulation by hydrobionts substantially depend on formation of hydrochemical composition of water, which, in its turn, is a complex process, depending on functioning of aquatic ecosystems and natural conditions of a water catchment basin. Hydrochemical regimes in reservoirs are determined by external factors and internal water body processes. The results of radionuclides Sr-90, Cs-137, Pu-238, Pu239+240 and Am-241 content in hydrobionts tissues of different trophic levels of water objects within the Chernobyl NPP exclusion zone have been analysed. Our studies were conducted: (1) to identify dynamics of radionuclide distribution in components of freshwater biocenose of water bodies within the Chernobyl NPP exclusion zone: (2) to study dynamic profiles of radioactive contamination levels in species of different ecological groups; (3) to assess the major factors, which determine distribution of radionuclides in the freshwater ecosystems, (4) to study the seasonal dynamics of radionuclides content in macrophites and the role of main aquatic plant associations in processes of radionuclides distribution in biotic component of biohydrocenose; (5) to assess a possibility to use hydrobionts of different trophic levels as biological indicators of radioactive contamination of water objects and (6) to assess the absorbed dose rate for hydrobionts from different water bodies.

The importance, though, of increased nitrogen (N) deposition in the episodic acidification of alpine lakes and N saturation in alpine ecosystems is only beginning to be documented. In alpine areas of the Colorado Front Range, modest loadings of N in deposition have been associated with leakage of N to surface waters. On the Colorado western slope, however, no leakage of N to surface waters has been reported. A 1995 study that included early season under-ice water samples that were not available in earlier studies showed that there is, in fact, N leakage to surface waters in some western slope basins. Under-ice nitrate (NO3-) concentrations were as high as 10.5 mu eq L-1, and only decreased to detection limits in September Landscape type appears to be important in leakage of N to surface waters, which is associated with basins having steep slopes, thin soils, and large amounts of exposed bedrock. NO3- leakage compounds the existing sensitivity to episodic acidification from low acid neutralizing capacity (ANC), which is less than 40 mu eq L-1 in those basins.																			0272-3646	1930-0557				SEP-OCT	1998	19	5					406	420		10.1080/02723646.1998.10642658	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02723646.1998.10642658													WOS:000080630100003

Measurements carried out in the Tatra Mountains National Park were concentrated on two lakes: Dlugi Staw and Zielony Staw, situated in the crystalline, granitic part of the mountains. These lakes differ from each other in altitude (1784 m and 1632 m a.s.l. respectively) as well as in quantity and variety of flora and fauna living in and around them. The wet deposition of acidifying compounds of sulphur and nitrogen, and their seasonal variability in the area of the lakes were measured and compared with the critical loads of sulphur and nitrogen for these lakes and their catchments. Results showed that the critical loads of both sulphur and nitrogen in Dhugi Staw were exceeded all over the year and in Zielony Staw the acid deposition was roughly equal to critical load. A surprisingly high concentration of nitrogen compounds in acid deposition, well above the absorption ability of both the lakes and their catchments were ascertained. Nitrogen retention coefficients calculated for the lakes were as follows: Dlugi Staw - approximately 10%, Zielony Staw - approximately 50%. Seasonal variability in nitrate ions concentration in the lakes' waters reflected their prominent acidification caused by nitrogen compounds corresponding to stages 2 and 3 in the scale proposed recently by Stoddard (Stoddard, 1994).																			0049-6979					DEC	1995	85	2					481	486		10.1007/BF00476875	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00476875													WOS:A1995UB05300033

As rainbow trout abundance increases, D. pulex standing crop decreases. This change results in an increase in phytoplankton standing crop. Multiple regression analyses on eight years of data was used to determine the statistical relationship between rainbow trout - D. pulex interactions, total phosphorus levels, and phytoplankton volume. Seasonal variation in phytoplankton volume correlated more closely to rainbow trout - D. pulex interactions than did monthly variations in algal biomass. Accounting for the lag in response time between the independent variables and phytoplankton volume improved the percentage of explained variance. The results indicate that the variance in seasonal phytoplankton standing crop is primarily a function of rainbow trout - D. pulex population dynamics.																			0270-5060					DEC	1993	8	4					341	353		10.1080/02705060.1993.9664873	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1993.9664873													WOS:A1993MN45900008

There are 2 versions of the traps: Model DAY collects efficiently for 24 h or less and can be emptied rapidly as the whole net can be removed by a fast stripping method. Model WEEK permits samples to be taken over longer periods (2-15 days) and is suitable for taxonomic purposes, surveys over wide regions or studies of large lakes and rivers. Both models can be used for quantitative or qualitative limnological studies such as daily and seasonal emergence patterns, life tables and the effects of peculiar ecological factors. The construction, dimensions and the methods of setting the traps are described in detail and special problems, such as the frequency of emptying, water condensation, predators and the criteria for the choice of models are discussed.																			0013-872X	2162-3236					1979	90	2					65	78																WOS:A1979GS25100001

There was a pronounced trend of decreasing diversity between years due to the loss of several rarer species. In any year, there were distinct seasonal assemblages of different species, as well as a group of permanent residents. There were few differences in species composition between various microhabitats in the lake.

The major rainy season is experienced as a hungry season mainly because of the scarcity of animal foodstuff. During this time, 68% of the Oto and 75% of the Twa pygmoids living in the same village lost weight (0.6-2.2 kg depending on age subgroup). Among the Oto, neither the fishermen nor the young villagers who did not change their food strategy lost significant weight, although the values were much higher among the former. The seasonal fishermen, who returned to the village during the rainy season, lost the most but recovered their initial weight during the following dry season. Also, the Twa and the elderly Oto were significantly affected. The changes in lean arm circumference and subcapular skinfold appeared to be associated with the weight loss.																			0367-0244	1543-5237					1982	12	3					139	153		10.1080/03670244.1982.9990709	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03670244.1982.9990709													WOS:A1982PP42300002

Understanding the fate of iron in a modern temperate estuary: Leirarvogur, Iceland	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												Fluvial dissolved Fe concentrations decrease upon mixing with seawater, resulting in the formation of Fe-floccules. However, a clear understanding of the fate of these floccules has yet to be established. Assessing how tidal processes affect the formation of Fe-colloids in the Leirarvogur estuary, SW Iceland, is an important step in understanding the formation and potential deposition of estuarine Fe-rich minerals within this estuarine system. The Leirarvogur estuary drains predominately Fe-rich basalt, increasing the likelihood of detecting changes in Fe-phases. Fluvial waters and local lake waters that drain into the estuary were compared and the effects of seasonal changes were considered, in an attempt to understand how varying end-members and external factors play a role in Fe-rich mineral formation. Aqueous and colloidal Fe concentrations were found to be greater towards the head of the Leirarvogur estuary, suggesting that potential Fe-rich minerals and complexes are forming at sites of fluvial input. Increasing suspended colloidal Fe towards the estuary mouth suggests that Fe-colloids are readily transported seaward. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Oculate pleurolophocercous cercariae shed from naturally infected Amnicola limosa were positively phototactic. Cercariae possessed 14 penetration glands with ducts terminating anteriorly in a 3:4:4:3 pattern, similar to that described for Clonorchis sinensis. Peak of cercarial production occurred in midsummer. Nearly all centrarchid fishes collected from Half Moon Lake were infected with metacercariae of A. elongatus. Lepomis macrochirus, L. gibbosus, and Micropterus salmoides exposed to cercariae in laboratory experiments proved to be the most susceptible second intermediate hosts. Prevalence in experimentally infected juvenile bluegills was 100% with an average intensity of 10.5 metacercariae. Two cyprinids, Pimephales promelas and Rhinichthys cataractae, were less suitable as hosts for metacercariae, and no other fishes exposed to cercariae in the laboratory could be infected. Metacercariae were infective 1 month postexposure. Adult A. elongatus were recovered from liver and pancreas of chickens and house sparrows fed metacercariae from naturally and experimentally infected fishes.																			1049-233X					JAN	1991	58	1					24	30																WOS:A1991EZ67000005

Tagimaucia crater lake and swamp are located at an altitude of 820 m in Taveuni, Fiji (lat. 16.degree.S; long. 179.degree.56''W). Rainfall exceeds evaporation in all seasons and residence time for water in the shallow lake (2.5-5.5 m deep) is only 4 days. 2. Dissolved ion concentrations are low (conductivity 14-18 .mu.S cm-1 at 25.degree.C), and the water is slightly acidic (pH 5.0-6.5 at 25.degree.C). Median total phosphorus (0.5 g m-3) and total nitrogen (3.3 g m-3) are moderately high and probably represent dissolved and suspended organic matter. Median chlorophyll a concentrations (2.5 mg-3) were low and indicate low phytoplankton productivity. 3. The swamp vegetation is domininated by Lepironia articulata (Retz.) Domin and algae which form floating sedge peat islands, and Pandanus taveuniensis St John and other small trees where alluvium and colluvium are infilling the margins of the crater. The surrounding slopes are forested. 4. The fauna of the lake and swamp are low in both diversity and abundance. The only aquatic vertebrates observed were Anguilla eels and cane toads, Bufo marinus L., and the only bird was the swamp harrier, Circus approximans approximans Peale.

J	Johnson, PG				Johnson, PG			Ice-dammed lake history, Dusty Glacier, St Elias Mountains, Yukon	CANADIAN GEOGRAPHER-GEOGRAPHE CANADIEN												Glacier margin ice-dammed lakes have been a common feature of the glacial landscape of the St. Nias Mountains of the southwest Yukon. The sedimentary successions in the lake basins contain a record of glacier hydrology variability and ice-dammed lake fluctuations. The interpretation of the sedimentology depends on an understanding of glacierized basin hydrology and particularly the suspended sediment dynamics of glacier discharge streams. A basin on the north margin of the Dusty Glacier contained a lake at least three times during deglaciation from the maximum of the Little Ice Age. The sedimentary record is composed of fluvioglacial sand and gravel facies from periods of drainage of the lake and a number of lacustrine facies that contain evidence of water level fluctuations. The lacustrine facies consist of laminated silt, laminated sill and sand, and stratified silt and sand, which are indicative of variable sediment input on daily, intra-seasonal, and seasonal time scales, but which are dominated by short time scale rythmites. The lake formed during surges of the Dusty Glacier and drained as the ice activity declined. Progressive downwasting of the Dustry Glacier at present indicates little potential for the lake to refill.																			0008-3658					FAL	1995	39	3					262	273		10.1111/j.1541-0064.1995.tb00417.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1541-0064.1995.tb00417.x													WOS:A1995TW43100005

Considering the scarcity of information on reproduction of fish in floodplain lakes, the study proposes to investigate the average size at first maturity and spawning season of S. spilopleura lakes Jaiteua-Sao Lourenco, Manacapuru, AM. Also related are the abiotic factors (water level and depth) and biotic (condition factor) with the spawning season. 232 females were captured from August 2006 to June 2007, using gill net, and in the laboratory were used for biometrics and identification of the maturation stages. The spawning season of the females was established through the temporal distribution of relative frequency in different maturation stages and relative condition factor, Kn = Pt/aCp(b), where: Kn = relative condition factor; Pt = total weight; Cp = standard length, a and b = constants obtained from regression between weight and length. And, to check for correlation between condition factor and with the spawning season depth of the lakes, we used the Spearman correlation coefficient of the 5% significance level. The amplitude of the standard length of specimens ranged 7-22 cm. Correlation analysis between Kn and spawning season (r(s) = 0.58, p < 0.05) was positive, i.e. the spawning season corresponded to the higher Kn, suggesting that an indicator of spawning season of S. spilopleura. There was a negative correlation between the depth and Kn (r(s) = -0.66, p < 0.05) and between depth and spawning season (r(s) = -0.25, p < 0.05). The estimated L-50 corresponded to 13.0 +/- 0.09 cm and 17.0 +/- 0.02 cm L-100, S. spilopleura develops its complex reproductive cycle in the lake of Grand Lake Manacapuru, and based on indicators of reproduction, spawning season and relative condition factor, spawning begins in December, early on the rising extending to February, mid-rising, which coincided with the rise of water level of the Solimoes-Amazon River and deep lakes.

The diversity of species was considerably greater (11 species) but prevalence was much lower in the larger river-connected Tichigan Lake than in the smaller land-locked Silver Lake (four species). Conditions in the latter lake enhanced denser populations of some species, e.g., Glaridacris catostomi Cooper, 1920 and G. laruei (Lamont, 1921) Hunter, 1927 and the acceleration of sexual development and/or early elimination of gravid specimens of others, e.g., G. catostomi and Isoglaridacris agminis Williams and Rogers, 1972. Isoglaridacris multivitellaria sp. n. is described from Erimyzon sucetta (Lacepede) in Silver Lake. It is most similar to I. agminis, e.g., in number of testes and length of ovarian arms, but is distinguished from it and other species of the genus by its extensive postovarian vitellaria and the long distance between its cirrus sac and ovary as well as by its follicular ovary. New state records for Wisconsin include I. folius Fredrickson and Ulmer, 1965 and Rowardleus pennensis Mackiewicz and Deutsch, 1976. The recovery of the first species from Catostomus commersoni (Lacepede) represents a new host record. Seasonal and host relationships are explored in the commonly encountered species and the morphometric characteristics of all species were assessed and compared with other published accounts.																			0018-0130					JAN	1986	53	1					48	58																WOS:A1986A190000003

TEMPORAL CHANGES IN THE PHYTOPLANKTON COMMUNITY OF A PHYSICALLY VARIABLE LAKE	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The week-to-week changes in the phytoplankton associations of Hamilton Harbor, Lake Ontario [Canada, USA] during the ice free periods of 1975, 1976 and 1977. Ordination by principal component analysis (PCA) is compared to a non-metric scaling technique (MDS). Standardized data suffer little distortion after PCA so the results of the 2 techniques are comparable. The analysis displays a broad seasonal cycle of species similar in each year, depending upon the presence of a seasonal thermocline. The species groups showed periods of oscillating stability and periods of change. There was rarely a precise correlation between the environment and the species at any point in time, as the species followed the fluctuations of the environment with a lag of at least 1 wk. The precise seasonal succession of species depended on the physical environment of each year. A new index of community change is introduced based on weakly changes in abundance. Changes in the abundance of species within the community rapidly reflected changes in the physical environment and were a more sensitive indicator than presence or absence. In 1975, there was a high correlation between Zm and axis 1 of the MDS ordination of environmental data. This correlation also existed in 1977, but axis 1 accounted for a smaller portion of the overall variability. Rapid fluctuations in the thermal structure in 1976 destroyed the correlations between the MDS axes and Zm and also produced reduced stability in the phytoplankton associations in surface waters. A critical Zeu/Zm ratio of approximately 0.35 was identified and decreases in the ratio below this critical value led to reduced performance by green algae and favored diatom populations. The description of effects of physical perturbations on the phytoplankton of the Harbor are extended to scales of months and years and into the realms of community changes.																			0003-9136						1980	89	4					447	473																WOS:A1980KH48100005

However, because such effort is not always logistically possible, the empirical relationships developed between these trophic status indicators may depend upon seasonal patterns of sampling. Clearly, it is desirable to know if some periods of the year are more likely to produce representative estimates of total phosphorus and chlorophyll a, or, alternatively, if sampling in other periods should be restricted or even avoided. Data from north-temperate lakes are used to examine the degree to which single monthly samples for total phosphorus and chlorophyll a represent seasonal means. Analyses indicate that the least precise and least accurate estimates of the means occur when single-visit synoptic surveys are conducted during April. Not until August to September do single sampling visits provide data that approximate those represented by the means garnered through more frequent sampling.						france, robert/0000-0002-9171-8426													0706-652X					AUG	1995	52	8					1812	1815		10.1139/f95-173	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f95-173													WOS:A1995TE92400021
J	JEWELL, PW				JEWELL, PW			A SIMPLE SURFACE-WATER BIOGEOCHEMICAL MODEL .1. DESCRIPTION, SENSITIVITY ANALYSES, AND IDEALIZED SIMULATIONS	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Accurate simulation of surface productivity, dissolved nutrient and oxygen concentrations, and particulate carbon flux are critical components of any viable surface water quality model. A linear, three-component model consisting of a dissolved limiting nutrient, phytoplankton, and zooplankton coupled to a one-dimensional turbulence closure fluid flow model has been constructed and applied to a generalized surface water setting. The model transfers nutrients from the euphotic zone to the subeuphotic zone using empirical biogenic flux-depth relationships. The model does not require specification of biogenic particle settling velocity which is known to vary by at least 2 orders of magnitude in natural surface waters and thus constitutes a major source of uncertainty in many biogeochemical models. Using an empirical biogenic flux-depth function to transfer nutrients through the water column introduces spatial errors which are most extreme in deep water. The model is thus most appropriate for lakes, estuaries, and shallow (<1000 m deep) marine settings. Restricting the model to three components with seven empirical constants permits a high degree of computational efficiency. Sensitivity analyses of the empirical constants show that integrated surface productivity is responsive to the three constants related to light (initial slope of the light-productivity curve, light attenuation coefficient of the water, and photosynthetically available radiation) while being relatively insensitive to constants which are strictly related to biogeochemical transformations (remineralization rate, nutrient half-saturation constant, maximum zooplankton growth rate, and Ivlev constant for zooplankton growth). Model simulations using idealized Surface temperature boundary conditions produce thermal and biogeochemical characteristics of a typical temperate-latitude lake. The simulations also suggest that vertical mixing plays an important role in producing the late seasonal, deep chlorophyll maximum commonly observed in many surface water settings.																			0043-1397					AUG	1995	31	8					2047	2057		10.1029/95WR01021	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/95WR01021													WOS:A1995RM64400020

In 1977 the lake was in its natural state and in 1978 and 1979 it was continuously fertilized with P and N. The fertilizations in 1978 and 1979 did not increase the annual epipelic production measured with 14C. The seasonal production pattern was the same during the 3 yr. The variation in production with depth was similar all 3 yr with mean values of 85 mg C .cntdot. m-2 d-1 at 2 m and 1 mg C .cntdot. m-2 d-1 at 11 m. Light penetration and water temperature were the most important environmental factors affecting epipelic production. A long turnover time, between 1 mo. and 14 yr at different depths of the probably well-adapted epipelic community probably explains the absence of a response to the fertilization.																			0105-9327						1983	6	4					349	355																WOS:A1983RM47900003

Population densities and size-frequency data for Neomysis are combined with information on the influence of body size on feeding rate and composition of the diet to predict relative predation intensity on 5 size classes of Daphnia over a 27-mo. period.

The giant hypodermal, lemniscal, and cement gland nuclei usually were spheroid or ovoid in prereproductive stages, elongate or lobulated in reproductively active adults, and spheroid in postreproductive adults; the latter stage was rarely encountered. Reproductive activity extends well beyond the season(s) during which gravid females are recovered in the field. Structural changes of giant nuclei were associated with the initiation and retention of the reproductive state of N. rutili. This pattern is similar to that reported for three other species of Neoechinorhynchus and thus may be of common occurrence in neoechinorhynchid acanthocephalans. Moreover, the pattern in N. rutili shows some overlap of stages and abbreviation of the postreproductive stage similar to the pattern of Neoechinorhynchus robertbaueri, which has a short lifespan (2-4 months) in its fish definitive host and a brief reproductive period.																			0003-0023					JAN	1992	111	1					65	69		10.2307/3226729	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3226729													WOS:A1992HG48000008
J	KITE, GW				KITE, GW			SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS OF SELECTED LAKE ERIE LEVELS	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Monthly Lake Erie levels recorded at Cleveland and at Buffalo were analyzed for trend, periodic, and autoregressive components. Trend components might be derived from changing channel conditions, increasing consumptive use of water, from climatic change, or from isostatic adjustments. The periodic component will contain the 12-month seasonal cycle but may also contain other cycles. Autoregression is caused, in this case, by the self-regulating reservoir effect of large lakes. It was found that, as might be expected for a large lake, autoregressive components dominate the time series and that there are also significant periodicities and minor trend components. No trend components were found that might correspond to the effects of a climatic change. Isostatic adjustment was measured between Cleveland and Buffalo but was found to be heavily masked by a periodicity in the differences in levels.																			0380-1330						1992	18	1					207	217		10.1016/S0380-1330(92)71288-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(92)71288-X													WOS:A1992HP68100020

Sixty-seven species of algae were identified, 18 Cyanophyta (Cyanobacteria), 19 Chlorophyta, 21 Bacillariophyta, 6 Euglenophyta, 2 Cryptophyta and one species Pyrrhophyta. Nitzschia (6 spp.), Scenedesmus (6 spp.), Navicula (4 spp.), Oscillatoria (4 spp.) and Euglena (4 spp.) were the most common genera. A remarkable seasonal variation in species composition and standing crop of the phytoplankton populations was noted during the study. The total phytoplankton standing crop appeared to be mainly dependent on the growth of certain species viz., Oscillatoria chalybea, O. princepes, O. tenuis, Microcystis aeruginosa, Anabaena constricta (Cyanophyta), Nitzschia obtusa, Bacillaria paradoxa, Cocconeis placentula, Cyclotella meneghiniana (Bacillariophyta), Pandorina morum, Volvox sp. (Chlorophyta) and Phacus curvicauda (Euglenophyta). The continuous presence of Anabaena constricta and Nitzschia palea was recorded in the treated sewage. The least represented algal divisions were Pyrrhophyta and Cryptophyta, both in terms of quality and quantity. The data indicate that the secondary effluents were unstable in their chemical features and grossly polluted. Therefore, the treatment systems must treat the discharged sewage to a tertiary level before discharging into Lake Manzala.

J	Strand, GH				Strand, GH			Large-scale variations in radial tree growth in Norway - An application of median polish for spatial trend detection	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												Radial growth was measured on 11,452 Norway spruce (Picea abies) trees on a systematic random sample of 1492 forest inventory sites in Norway. The data were decomposed using median polish and examined for spatial trends. Radial growth was higher than average in the far south and fewer than average in the north. This latitudinal trend followed a linear gradient in the eastern, continental parts of the country. A similar but less smooth gradient was also found in the western, coastal region. Summary points were used to characterize and compare the two gradients. Radial tree growth in the western region was consistently lower than in the eastern region, but the shapes of the two gradients were almost identical. These may be explained as an effect of a climatic gradient shared by the two regions, with high radial growth broadly corresponding to a warmer climate and a longer growing season. Norway spruce is at the limit of its geographical range near the western coast of Norway, which may explain the generally lower growth rate here. The results do not support the hypothesis that widespread forest decline is taking place in Norway, but surprisingly high growth in the extreme south of the country may be related to the fertilizing effect of airborne nitrogen deposition. Median polish of geographical data was found to perform well as an alternative technique for spatial trend detection. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	COATES, D				COATES, D			BIOLOGY OF THE RAINBOWFISH, GLOSSOLEPIS-MULTISQUAMATUS (MELANOTAENIIDAE), FROM THE SEPIK RIVER FLOODPLAINS, PAPUA-NEW-GUINEA	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												G. multisquamatus is abundant in the Sepik River, prefering floodplain lakes and marginal areas of floodplain with moderate turbidity. It is the only rainbowfish documented to inhabit river floodplains. Migrations onto and off the floodplain occur in response to change in flood conditions. Seasonality is evident in reproduction, condition factor and fat deposit and stomach fullness indices; all increasing in the flood season. Fecundity is high compared with stream dwelling rainbowfish species mainly due to decreased egg size. The reproductive strategy of G. multisquamatus is interpreted as a response to increased adult mortalities encountered on floodplains in comparison to more stable stream habitats occupied by related species. G. multisquamatus is carnivorous, its diet being similar to other rainbowfishes, consisting of a variety of small invertebrates taken from mid-water or the water surface. The ecology and behavior of G. multisquamatus is explained as a partial colonisation of newly developed flood plains in this river.																			0378-1909	1573-5133				OCT	1990	29	2					119	126		10.1007/BF00005028	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00005028													WOS:A1990EA09100004

The adult bream population was dominated by the 1973 and 1976 year-classes. These year classes still formed most of the spawning population in 1987, but had grown very little (< 2 cm) in the previous 5 years. In November 1987, 158 kg ha-1 of bream were removed from this lake and in 1988 the remaining bream population showed an increase in growth (mean length by 2.7 cm and mean weight by 0.5 kg) and condition (1.87 in 1987 to 2.09 in 1988) in one growing season. This additional growth of an ageing stunted bream population is considered to be the result of an increased food supply after reducing the fish density.					, Ros/JXX-3284-2024															1095-8649				OCT	1990	37	4					629	634																WOS:A1990EC56200013
J	LEWIS, WM; FROST, T; MORRIS, D				LEWIS, WM; FROST, T; MORRIS, D			STUDIES OF PLANKTONIC BACTERIA IN LAKE VALENCIA, VENEZUELA	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The planktonic bacteria of Lake Valencia, Venezuela, were studied between 1977 and 1981. Total counts done by epifluorescence microscopy showed that approximately two-thirds of the bacterial cells were solitary coccoid forms spanning a size range of 0.07 to 4 .mu.m3/cell. Most of the remaining bacterial cells were rod-shaped. The study also documented the steady presence of smaller numbers of distinctive bacterial morphotypes such as Planctomyces. More than 90% of the bacteria were unattached to any kind of particulate substrate. In the upper water column, the annual average bacterial abundance was 0.5 .times. 106 .mu.m3/cc, or about 50 .mu.g/l bacterial carbon. This corresponded to about 3% of phytoplankton cell carbon over the same interval. Bacterial abundance in the upper and lower water column was essentially uniform as long as the lake was mixing. During the stratification season, however, bacterial abundances in the anoxic deep water declined to very low levels. At irregular intervals, penetration of oxygen into deep water caused by thickening of the mixed layer resulted in increases of bacterial abundance in deep water. In the upper water column, the lowest bacterial abundances occurred after the mixed layer had assumed a stable thickness for an extended interval, and increased whenever the thickness of the mixed layer increased. Tests were made for presence of allelopathic substances during the year 1981. These tests showed that significant suppression of bacterial growth could be accounted for by the presence of allelopathic substances. Allelopathic effects were limited to the stratification season and coincided with periods of decline in bacterial abundance and stable mixed layer thickness. Bacterial abundances are not directly related to phytoplankton abundance, but rather to mixing events, which exercise their effect partially through relationships to allelopathy. Calculations incorporating the rates of phytoplankton metabolism and maximum possible rates of bacterial metabolism demonstrate that the planktonic bacteria of Lake Valencia process a very small fraction of the net primary production. Since primary production is also not efficiently intercepted by zooplankton, sediment bacteria and sediment storage play a very large role in carbon flux of this lake.

Two generations of clams were produced each year, with major recruitment occurring from April-early July and Aug.-Oct. Individuals born during either birth period lived for about 1 yr. Minimum size at birth was 4.0 mm, and only adults with a shell length > 10.0 mm contributed to recuitment in the population. Examination of seasonal size distributions of embryos reveal an average embryonic development rate of 0.32 mm wk-1 during April-Oct.; the rate was lower during other times of the the year. The annual selection ratio (average number of young born per adult) was 10.49:1 (7.68:1, April-July; 3.81:1, Aug.-Oct.); embryonic mortality was 97.5%. These results are compared with published values for a lake population of S. striatinum and indicate that the differences observed in life history characteristics for these populations apparently do not conform to expectations based on r- and K-selection theory. Instead, the differences can best be explained by a bet-hedging theory dependent on stochastic rather than deterministic processes. Life-history characteristics of other pisidiid clams are compared with results from this study and discussed in relation to the adaptive plasticity of freshwater mollusks.																			0008-4301	1480-3283					1982	60	2					249	260		10.1139/z82-033	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z82-033													WOS:A1982NF56400021
J	KING, RD; TYLER, PA				KING, RD; TYLER, PA			LAKE FIDLER, A MEROMICTIC LAKE IN TASMANIA	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Lake Fidler, Tasmania, Australia, a shallow riverine lake, owes its meromictic condition to an estuarine salt wedge in the Gordon River. Construction of a power station now prevents penetration of this wedge up the river and the lake may revert to holomoxis. At present, an abrupt chemocline occurs at a depth of 2.2 m. The monimolimnion is anoxic, sulfuretted and a metabolic watershed. The redoxcline/oxycline separating the 2 layers is straddled by a narrow stratified plate of flagellates and photoautotrophic bacteria, in which population density waxes and wanes with the seasons and produces a pronounced peak of chlorophyll, absorbing at 657 nm, at that depth. The lake is dystrophic, the gilvin (gelbstoff) severely restricting the quantity and quality of downwelling PAR [photosynthetically active radiation]. The bacteria, probably Chlorobiaceae, photosynthesize at intensities well below 1% of surface irradiation, PAR values being < 1 .times. 1017 .mu.E m-2 sec-1 nm-1 over a 640-730 nm red band. Copepods are restricted to the aerobic mixolimnion but chaoborid larvae (Chaoborus sp.) are found in the sulfide-rich monimolimnion, and probably migrate across the chemocline.																			0003-9136						1982	93	4					393	422																WOS:A1982NK08900001

Flocks increased in size and made increasing use of air thermals as they traveled toward foraging areas. Flocks were most common and most variable in size between 1145 and 1345. Flock size was stable over the season, while the number commuting each day increased geometrically to a maximum by the end of the nestling period. Flocks observed near the colonies were characterized by low, horizontal, flap-gliding flight. Further enroute they flew higher and showed greater frequencies of gliding and ascending flight associated with increasing use of thermals. The results provide no support for the view that colonies and flocks represent manifestations of functional information centers. The results agree with the alternative interpretation that colonies and flocks facilitate group foraging and permit effective use of local enhancement as a means of locating thermals.																			0008-4301	1480-3283					1982	60	5					1024	1031		10.1139/z82-143	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z82-143													WOS:A1982NS95100041

Particulate matter (0.45-100 .mu.m) was analyzed occasionally for total C, N, S, Fe, Mn, cations, Cl, silica and organic matter. Sediment traps under the floating papyrus mat were used to obtain an estimate of the rate of sedimentation inside the swamp. All of the dissolved nutrients (N, P, S, Fe and Mn) generally showed a common pattern in vertical profiles through the swamp, with minimum values at the swamp surface and maximum values on the bottom. The prevailing pH, O2 and redox potentials in the swamp indicate that at the surface much of the Fe would be present as ferric-Fe, while ferrous-Fe predominates on the bottom; PO4-P may be adsorbed to Fe-organic complexes at the swamp surface; Mn would be in a soluble form; SO4-S is low and may be adsorbed or otherwise bound; H2S is in very low concentration; CH4 is present; and O2 is generally low or lacking. The annual output of organic N is much larger than the total input from the river, suggesting that N is fixed in appreciable quantities. The maximum insoluble material (detritus and particulate matter) exceeds 27,000 mg/l. Most of the nutrients were in this organic sediment, which represents a large portion of the annual nutrient input to the swamp. Papyrus swamps effectively extract dissolved nutrients from tropical river systems, but such nutrients are later exported as organic particulate matter or adsorbed to particles which are carried into the lake by through-flow. Papyrus swamps contribute appreciable amounts of fixed N to lake-swamp systems.																			0022-0477	1365-2745					1979	67	3					953	981		10.2307/2259223	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2259223													WOS:A1979HZ61900011

Oxygen stress alters the shape and structure of membranous organelles, including mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi complex, and also damages nuclear and cytoplasmic membranes. Mitochondria, ribosomes, and neurotransmitter vesicles are all markedly reduced in number and become swollen with fragmented cristae in neurons exposed to either anoxia or hyperoxia. Clumping of nuclear chromatin, dilatation of the Golgi complex, degranulation of the endoplasmic reticulum, loss of neurotransmitter vesicles, and degenerative changes are more severe in neurons following anoxia than in those exposed to hyperoxia. These morphological changes may partly explain the behavior of freshwater invertebrates exposed to wide seasonal fluctuations in oxygen concentration of lake or pond water.

J	BONNY, AP				BONNY, AP			RECRUITMENT OF POLLEN TO SESTON AND SEDIMENT OF SOME LAKE DISTRICT LAKES	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Cores of surface sediment (of known accumulation rate) from 5 Lake District lakes [Scotland; United Kingdom] were analyzed quantitatively for pollen. Recent rates of total pollen deposition in mid-lake (cm2/yr) were estimated to be about 5 times higher in Blelham Tarn and Esthwaite Water than in Ennerdale Water, Wastwater and Windermere and appear to be related to the area and/or diameter of the lakes sampled. The vegetation within 1 km of the 5 lakes (especially the area or proportion of woodland cover), is not consistently reflected by either pollen deposition rates or pollen percentages in surface sediment. This anomaly was further investigated by measuring pollen deposition per unit area per unit time in floating traps and in submerged seston traps at Blelham Tarn and Ennerdale Water, lakes which contrast in size and in vegetational setting. Catches in the seston traps varied seasonally according to the relative recruitment of fresh airborne pollen, and settled pollen resuspended from the mud surface. Input of stream-born pollen was nonseasonal, however. Pollen trapped in relation to volume and dry weight of seston varied seasonally with plankton production, and nonseasonally with input of stream-borne material. The annual ratio pollen:seston was lower in shallow, productive Blelham Tarn than in deep, oligotrophic Ennerdale Water, but in each lake pollen trapped was approximately equivalent cm2/yr to pollen deposited recently at the mud surface. Proportional recruitment of regional pollen rich in arboreal pollen is greater in large lakes than small ones. This may explain in part the percentage over-representation of tree pollen in the sediments of those large lakes investigated which have a low proportion of woodland cover within 1 km.																			0022-0477	1365-2745					1976	64	3					859	+		10.2307/2258814	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2258814													WOS:A1976CL98200006

The range of habitats and host plants used by this species is wider than commonly believed. While many populations are found in seasonal or permanent wetlands, others are located in dry, old fields or woodland areas. The host plants used vary with habitat, but they include all major primary hosts and many secondary hosts previously reported plus several new records. The biology of E. phaeton is shown to be similar to western Euphydryas butterflies in which variation in habitat and host plant use is well documented.																			0090-0222					WIN	1991	24	4					207	217																WOS:A1991HG69200001
J	Sharples, AD; Evans, CW				Sharples, AD; Evans, CW			Impact of pulp and paper mill effluent on water quality and fauna in a New Zealand hydro-electric lake	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												The Kinleith pulp and paper mill discharges effluent into the Kopakorahi arm of Lake Maraetai (New Zealand) resulting in an effluent gradient defined by the effluent visibility (Secchi disc), transmittance (465 nm), temperature, and oxygen level that is discernible at least as far down stream as the adjoining Lake Waipapa. This effluent gradient is reflected in the composition of the fauna caught in fyke nets which at the most effluent-exposed sites is dominated by goldfish (Carassius auratus) and is depauperate in pollution-sensitive species such as freshwater crayfish (Paranephrops planifrons) and trout (Salmo trutta and Oncoryhynchus mykiss). In 1991 the Kinleith mill undertook substantial process modifications which have resulted in improvements in the water quality of the discharge. Secchi disc visibilities have increased markedly at the most effluent-exposed sites since modernisation of the mill and similar improvements have been observed in light transmittance. A seasonal trend in water temperature not previously observed was recorded at the most effluent-exposed sites following modernisation, and dissolved oxygen levels at these sites rose markedly. Improvements in the water quality of the recipient since the mill modernisation are reflected in changes in the sampled fauna in particular the occurrence of trout at sites from which they were previously absent.

This wetland is characterized with four lakes (Salt Lake, Bolluk Lake, Tersakan Lake and Gok Lake). The Salt Lake, Tersakan Lake and Bolluk Lake are so important because of its contribution to country economy and enabling ecosystem services for endangered bird species. In recent years, The Salt, Tersakan and Bolluk Lakes are in danger of completely drying. The main reasons of drying of the lakes are global warming, the lack of precipitation, shallowness of the lakes, excessive evaporation and inadequate recharge sources. The Salt Lake, Tersakan Lake and Bolluk Lake have Na-Cl water type and EC values can be reached 592.670 mu S/cm in rainy season. Research findings point out a thundering rise at SO4 concentration in addition to Cl ion in the Bolluk and Tersakan Lakes. The Gok Lake has Na-HCO3 water type in rainy season, while it has Na-Cl water type in dry season. EC values of the Go Lake range from 1058 to 1573 mu S/cm in both seasons. All of the lakes are alkaline type with 8.15 and 9.46 pH values. Al, As, P and B values in the Salt Lake; As, Se, P and B values in the Tersakan Lake; Se, P, Pb and B values in the Bolluk Lake; As and B values in the Gok Lake are clearly exceed the aqualitic life standards. The reasons of high values of this ions in the lakes are probably due to discharging of sewage, domestic and medical wastes without purification from Konya, Cihanbeyli and the surrounding settlements to the Salt Lake, Bolluk Lake and Tersakan Lake. The delta O-18 and delta H-2 values of the lakes are range between -6.14 parts per thousand and 1.44 parts per thousand, -48.59 parts per thousand and -7.53 parts per thousand, respectively. All of the waters have meteoric origin. The samples collected from all of the lake waters show an evaporation effect. In comparison to the other lake waters, isotopic value of the Gok Lake water is poor than the other lake waters. This position shows a mixing of regional groundwater and the lake water.																			1314-2704						2011							497	504																WOS:000307366000067

J	Jha, PK; Masao, M				Jha, Pawan; Masao, Minagawa			Factors Affecting Denitrification Rate in Barato Lake, Hokkaido, Japan	ASIAN JOURNAL OF WATER ENVIRONMENT AND POLLUTION												We examined the sediment denitrification rate and factors affecting the denitrification in Barato lake, an eutrophic oxbow lake in lower Ishikari river basin. Denitrification rate was measured using acetylene inhibition technique on the sediment samples collected during August 2009 to July 2010. The sediment denitrification rate ranged from 0.13 to 2.21 mu g N g(-1)DM h(-1) with an average of 0.91 mu g N g(-1) DM h(-1) in Barato lake. Denitrification rate showed positive correlation with dissolved nitrate concentration of lake water, indicating that water column nitrate concentration control the sediment denitrification rate in Barato lake. Nutrient amended denitrification assay experiments showed that denitrification rate increased significantly with addition of nitrate regardless of sediment C content, while no significant variation was observed with addition of labile C (glucose). Temperature positively affected the rate of denitrification with five- fold increase in activity on increasing temperature from 5 degrees C to 20 degrees C. Nitrate controlled denitrification followed Michaelis- Menten kinetics with V-max as 2.65 mu g N g(-1) DM h(-1) and K-m as 0.48 mg/l NO3- -N. The value of K-m was comparable with other studies but was well below the median dissolved nitrate concentration (2.95 mg/l NO3- -N) indicating that the process of denitrification was saturated in Barato lake.																			0972-9860	1875-8568					2011	8	3					1	10																WOS:000211161700002
J	Koc, J; Duda, M				Koc, Jozef; Duda, Marcin			ROLE OF THE RETENTION RESERVOIR IN SZABRUK FOR THE CHLORINE ION MIGRATION FROM ITS AGRICULTURAL CATCHMENT	ECOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY AND ENGINEERING A-CHEMIA I INZYNIERIA EKOLOGICZNA A												The role of a retention reservoir in chlorine migration from an agricultural catchment area was analyzed during the hydrological years 2005/2007. The investigated retention reservoir is situated in a valley, in the lower course of the Szabruk stream flowing into Lake Wulpinskie located in north-eastern Poland, in the Olsztyn Lakeland mesoregion. The chlorine content of water evacuated from the catchment was determined in the range of 3.0 mg Cl . dm(-3) to 43.0 mg Cl . dm(-3), and it was determined by the type and intensity of catchment use. The highest chlorine levels were noted in agricultural catchments connected to a drainage network (20.6 mg Cl . dm(-3) on average), lower concentrations were found in farming areas drained via ditches (11.4 mg Cl . dm(-3)), while the lowest Cl content of water was determined in outflows from afforested catchments (5.3 mg Cl . dm(-3) on average). Chlorine concentrations were lower in the growing season in all studied catchment types. The chlorine load evacuated from the catchment was determined by the type of catchment use. The greatest chlorine loss per hectare of the catchment area was noted in the agricultural catchment connected to a drainage network (13.8 kg Cl . ha(-1) . year(-1)), a smaller Cl load was evacuated from the catchment drained via ditches (6.2 kg Cl . ha - 1 . year(-1)), while the smallest loss was observed in the afforested catchment (4.1 kg Cl . ha(-1) . year(-1)). Chlorine concentrations increased by 10 %, from 8.2 mg Cl . dm(-3) to 9.0 mg Cl . dm(-3) following the passage of the stream's waters through the retention reservoir. The above resulted from the inflow of drainage water with a high chlorine content as well as higher Cl concentrations due to evapotranspiration. The chlorine content of water remained unchanged after the Szabruk stream passed through the retention reservoir and the band ditch, indicating that chlorine is a good tracer of water movement through drainage facilities.																			1898-6188	2084-4530					2011	18	5-6					723	730																WOS:000420342000009

Significant effects of seston concentration and temperature and especially their interaction were detected upon survival, number of prereproductive instars, growth increment per instar and duration of development. Low summertime seston concentrations that were sufficient for good survival and growth at a low rearing temperature (12.degree. C) generally produced high mortality, slow development and reduced biomass increments at higher temperature (21.degree. C). Poor growth and survival under low seston-high temperature conditions were exaggerated in Aug. compared with May, suggesting possible seasonal changes in natural seston quality and/or juvenile daphnid physiology. Higher food levels typical of springtime conditions produced excellent survival and growth regardless of the test temperature employed or season examined. Food limitation of daphnid development was dependent upon both temperature and food concentration within the range of conditions commonly observed in oligotrophic lakes. Extrapolation of development rates measured under only a limited range of food-temperature conditions or taken from literature values should be done cautiously.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1981	38	11					1357	1362		10.1139/f81-182	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f81-182													WOS:A1981MT89600007
J	NYHOLM, N				NYHOLM, N			SIMULATION-MODEL FOR PHYTOPLANKTON GROWTH AND NUTRIENT CYCLING IN EUTROPHIC, SHALLOW LAKES	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												A simulation model was developed for phytoplankton growth and P and N cycling in eutrophic, shallow lakes. The model describes a seasonal cycle in a lake, which on a 1 yr time scale, is assumed to be in equilibrium with respect to the inputs of nutrients. Forecasts made using the model of the effects of altered inputs predict new future equilibria. The model is simple and oriented towards practical applications. It is intended to describe average conditions only and the time scale resolution is of the order of several days. The model was used to simulate 12 different lakes in Denmark, some of which are described by 2 or more boxes. Most parameter values in the model were common to all simulations, while a few key parameters were allowed to vary somewhat from lake to lake. These parameters, however, could generally be chosen within quite a narrow range and if deviations from this range were necessary a qualitative explanation could usually be given. For lakes with short hydraulic retention times the simulations generally gave reasonably good results, and forecasts made with the model were in qualitative agreement with educated guesses. Parameter values and selected numerical results, e.g., as annual primary production, are listed for all simulations performed. A few examples are discussed in more detail.																			0304-3800	1872-7026					1978	4	2-3					279	310		10.1016/0304-3800(78)90011-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3800(78)90011-X													WOS:A1978ER44200011

The concentrations of copper and iron in surface water of Lake Kasumigaura were monitored at five sites from 1989. The concentrations of copper were about 0.6-1 mu g L(-1) for St. 1, 3, 9 and 12, whereas they were 0.8-1.4 mu g L(-1) for St. 7. This similarity may be due to the formation of a stable soluble complex species, and also small variations of the copper concentrations in inflowed rivers. The seasonal changes in the copper concentrations became unclear in the middle 1990s. The iron concentrations in the Lake were lower than 10 mu g L(-1), except those at St. 1. It seems that most of the iron is supplied from rivers, and it precipitates at the river-mouth region. The concentrations of iron at St. 1 were 50 mu g L(-1) before the early 1990s, whereas they became 20 mu g L(-1) after the late 1990s. Although the reasons for the changes in the late 1990s are very complicated, the change in the surface level of the lake water, by controlling the Hitachi River Watergate, which started in 1996, may be one of the reasons. The surface level of the lake water became 30 cm higher after control of the Watergate; this may have moved the sedimentation-active river-mouth area to the upper side of the lake.

In a seasonal study, FDCMU of all populations was depressed by bright light in an incubator. However, when the euphotic zone did not exceed the depth of the mixed layer, vertical transport of phytoplankton into either low-light or dark regions apparently allowed reversal of photoinhibition of FDCMU as a bioassay of vertical mixing include rapidly of response time, ease of measurement in the field, and insensitivity of this parameter to changes in phosphorus status of the population. Because of seasonal changes in the photoadaptive response of natural populations, the rate constants and threshold light levels required to cause the response must be determined at each use if the method is to be quantitative.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				DEC	1987	44	12					2144	2154		10.1139/f87-263	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f87-263													WOS:A1987M856600011

N. Duck behavior was related to the time of day, weather conditions and food resources. In May, the dominant food resource was Chironomidae imagines, which were either present on the aquatic vegetation, or on the water surface. The food-seeking behavior of wigeon, teal and mallard was at that time almost exclusively restricted to the water surface or above it, while the pintails also fed below the surface. In June, the Chironomidae imagines were still present but in greatly reduced numbers. The wigeon and teal now also fed to some extent below the water surface; for mallard and pintail this type of feeding behavior was dominant. In Aug., the Chironomidae imagines had all disappeared, but their larval biomass on the lake botton had increased. The wigeon still fed predominantly on or above the water surface while all the other duck species now almost exclusively fed below it. In June cold and windy weather induced teal and pintail, but not mallard, to feed more frequently below the water surface, although such weather conditions in May and Aug. did not lead to any drastic changes in the feeding behavior of any duck species.																			0030-5693						1982	13	2					129	134		10.2307/3676199	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3676199													WOS:A1982PC48200006

Toxin removal form drinking water is becoming a worldwide concern By using a highly sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), the removal effects of different water treatments to low concentration of microcystins in raw water were evaluated. The initial concentration of microcystins in raw water nas 3530pg/ml. Bleaching powder, alum, activated carbon resin, maifan stone, ultraviolet ray, boiling and making tea were tested. The results showed that bleaching powder and activated carbon were more effective in removing microcystins. Their removal rates were 96.1% and 90.5%, respectively. Boiling or making tea was ineffective in reducing microcystins.

Puffers are plastic devices containing a pressurized aerosol can filled with pheromone. A timer triggers a plunger to open a valve, releasing a given amount of pheromone at a preset time interval. Puffers full of the codling moth (Cydia pomonella) (CM) pheromone codlemone and butane-propane propellent were applied to 65 hectares (160 acres) of Bartlett pears under heavy CM pressure( 178 moths per season, 5-year average per orchard) in Kelseyville, Lake County, California on April 16. Devices were placed every 55m (135 feet) around the perimeter of the site, with some additional ones within the site for an application rate of 1 per 0.53 ha (1.3 acres). Pheromone was released every 25 minutes from April through September. All dispensers were replaced June 1; the butane was replaced with an experimental propellent and OBLR pheromone was added. Upwind units were again replaced in mid July due to propellent interference with emission during a prolonged heat spell. On all but 63 ha (156 acres), the normal CM control program was carried out in addition to the pheromone. Four 0.4 ha (1-acre) plots in the center of the site were left untreated except for pheromone. Numerous 1 mg., 10 mg., and OBLR traps were placed throughout the site, as well as in two upwind standard program orchards used as grower controls. A third upwind orchard lacking any CM control was used as an untreated comparison. Trap catches, CM eggs and fruit damage (Ist generation, preharvest, bin and postharvest samples) were recorded in mating disruption (MD), standard, and untreated orchards. No eggs were found in any plots in a mid-May sample and there was no Ist generation CM damage; however, OBLR damage averaged 1% in the MD plots. Preharvest CM damage was zero in downwind MD plots but averaged 1.8% in upwind plots. Bin counts were 0 in downwind and averaged 1.0% in upwind plots. OBLR damage averaged 11% in all MD plots but only 1.0% in the MD + OP-treated areas, reflecting the lack of early OBLR pheromone to control the Ist generation and confirming the relative efficacy of chemical control.																			0567-7572		90-6605-920-6				1998		475					503	510		10.17660/ActaHortic.1998.475.62	http://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.1998.475.62													WOS:000077633200063
J	Pyrovetsi, MD; Economidis, PS				Pyrovetsi, MD; Economidis, PS			The diet of Dalmatian pelicans (Pelecanus crispus) breeding at Lake Mikri Prespa National Park, Greece	ISRAEL JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												The diet of breeding Dalmatian pelicans (Pelecanus crispus) was studied at Lake Mikri Prespa National Park, Greece during May and June of 1992, 1993, 1995, and 1996. Analyses of chicks' regurgitates obtained from the Mikri Prespa nesting colony showed that Dalmatian pelicans predominantly consumed Chalcalburnus belvica, an endemic fish restricted to lakes Mikri and Megali Prespa, i.e., they exploited exclusively local fish resources during breeding. We found within-breeding season, as well as annual variation in mean weight and length of the fish captured, but no year-to-year variation in mean weight of regurgitates (about 384 g). C. belvica was the most abundant fish in the total commercial catch from the Prespa lakes. Hatching of Dalmatian pelican eggs at Mikri Prespa Lake coincided with schooling and spawning of C. belvica. The prolonged period of multiple spawning (until August) provided pelicans with a continuous food supply throughout breeding. This coincidence, combined with the abundance and availability of C. belvica, may explain the exclusive choice of this prey from more than 20 fish species found in the Prespa Lakes. We may, therefore, relate successful breeding and possible choice of nesting site of Dalmatian pelicans to the presence and availability of C. belvica.																			0021-2210						1998	44	1					9	17																WOS:000074235100003

Since that rime its population size has increased dramatically. In order to determine whitefish egg predation, in December 1995, during and after the spawning season of nearshore spawning whitefish, Coregonus lavaretus (local name: Gangfisch), ruffe were collected with bottom gill nets with bar mesh sizes of 8-20 mm. The nets were set in the morning for a maximum of three hours. Immediately after the catch the stomach, were prepared and preserved in 5 % formalin solution. Stomach content was analysed later in the laboratory. During the spawning season of whitefish, nearly all ruffe investigated had whitefish eggs in their stomachs. The number of eggs ingested was up to a median of 2 / g ruffe wet weight. That means, that theoretically, about 300 ruffe of 20 g wet weight are able to consume all the eggs of a Coregonus lavaretus female per day, during the main spawning season (middle of December). Whitefish eggs were found in ruffe stomachs until the middle of January 1996. As ruffe are now very abundant in Lake Constance, it is suggested, that ova predation by ruffe may have negative effects on the natural recruitment of nearshore spawning Coregonus lavaretus.																			0071-1128		3-510-47052-4				1998	50						179	183																WOS:000078180200018

Chlorophyta was the most dominant group followed by Cyanobacteria, Euglenophyta, Pyrrhophyta, Bacillariophyceae and Chrysophyceae. Dominant species were mainly the desmids; Cosmarium and Staurastrum. Chlorophyll a concentrations and phytoplankton productivity ranged from <1.1 mg/m(3) to 38.5 mg/m(3) and from < 2.8 - 54.4 mgC/m(3)/hr respectively. Maximum phytoplankton density, net primary productivity and chlorophyll a occurred before the onset and immediately after the monsoon season in November-January. Total phytoplankton densities were highest in the top 5 m and decreased with depth. However, maximum primary productivity and chlorophyll a concentrations were found near the metalimnion (10 -15 m) which could be due to high autotrophic bacterial population at this depth. Occurrence of high phytoplankton densities and production during the pre and post monsoon period was probably due to the intrusion of the nutrient enriched water from the hypolimnion brought about by the cooler temperature and water turbulence during this period.

During the early rainy season eggs survived in sandy habitats only; the survival rate was 29.2%. The fastest rate of egg development occurred in this season, as indicated by an incubation period of 9.5 days, which coincided with the highest airtemperature (29.8-36.2 degrees C) in the area. The lowest development rate occurred during the harmattan when incubation lasted 24 days in day, the only suitable soil for egg survival (11.4%) during the season. The slow rate of development coincided with the lowest air temperatures, which ranged from 19.2 to 25.6 degrees C. During the main rainy season eggs survived in all the three habitats and the development rates were intermediate to those in the two seasons already mentioned. Incubation lasted 13.6 days in sand, 16.0 days in sandy-clay loam and 18.1 days in clay and these rates corresponded to intermediate temperatures ranging from 24.6 to 27.3 degrees C. The best survival rates occurred during the main rainy season; 49.9% in sand, 25.1% in clay and 16.6% in sandy-clay loam. Eggs did not survive in any habitat during the hot-dry seasons. Predation was the major egg mortality factor, followed by parasitism. The predatory suspects were coleopterous larvae and the mite Allothrombium sp. The parasitoids were Scelio africanus Farriere, Scelio sudanensis Farriere and an unidentified enchytraeid worm. Desiccation and decay were minor mortality factors.																			0967-0874					APR-JUN	1995	41	2					87	96		10.1080/09670879509371929	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09670879509371929													WOS:A1995TB01800005

PRODUCTION IN ORGANIC-FLOCCULANT SEDIMENTS	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												Season chemical trends and wild rice production were examined in unproductive organic-flocculent sediments from three lakes. Variations occurred in the level of organic matter and nutrient concentrations among these lakes. However, these among-lake variations were as distinct as the differences that occurred between these lakes and a productive wild rice lake. The three organic-flocculent lakes exhibited similar poor wild rice production, retarded phenological development, and red colouration on wild rice stems and leaves. Although nturient variations did occur among the organic-flocculent lakes, it was hypothesized that a common limiting factor was affecting wild rice production in this type of sediment.																			0008-4026					JUL	1990	68	7					1542	1548		10.1139/b90-197	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b90-197													WOS:A1990DV19400019

The behavioural and physiological mechanisms by which these organisms cope with the conditions of hypoxia and anoxia prevalent during seasonal stratification of the lake waters was considered. During stratification all of these species, with the exception of resting stage A. bicuspidatus, disappeared from the profundal zone and were limited to the shallower margins of the lake. None of these copepod species entered the plankton and established planktonic populations, none appeared capable of sustained anaerobic respiration, although all can withstand some degree of hypoxia, and only A. bicuspidatus appeared capable of entering resting stages. The data suggest that in eutrophic lakes species normally found in the profundas deal with anoxia by lateral migration to shallow waters where oxygen is available.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB 1	1986	131	3					225	234		10.1007/BF00008858	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008858													WOS:A1986A112000004

The major ions were analyzed by means of monthly measures recorded from 1986 to 2005. The water characteristics and the correlation among variables, which were weak and did not allowed applying data reduction, were also determined. The sources of supply were evaluated using ternary and Gibbs diagrams, as well as the ionic relationships. The water was non-saline, hard, with prevalence of calcium and bicarbonate ions. The chemical quality of the water was in correspondence with the basin geology and dominated by rock weathering. It did not show any significant difference between the dry and humid periods and any seasonal variation. The relationships among a group of variables during 2006 and 2007 were evaluated applying correlations between them as well as principal component analyses. The database included pH, dissolved oxygen, redox potential, temperature, nutrients, iron and manganese. According to the results, the quality of the water was influenced by autochthonous processes, which are related to stratification and mixtures of the reservoir, allochthonous processes related to the pollution in the basin, and thermal changes in the reservoir.																			0188-4999					NOV	2010	26	4					257	267																WOS:000287391700001

The results of these experiments could be fitted with a hyperbolic function in the manner of the Michaelis-Menten equation (excluding rates of dark assimilation), up to .apprx. 40% of the surface PPFD after which photon inhibition occurred. The half saturation constants relative to incidence PPFD (KLT) for NO3- assimilation (.hivin.X = 1.1 E [Einstein] m-2 d-1) were about twice those for NH4+ (.hivin.X = 0.5 E m-2 d-1). All of the KLT values correspond to depths in the lake ranging from 17-29 m (.apprx. 1% of surface PPFD). Dark assimilation of both NO3- and NH4+ was .apprx. 50% of the assimilation at saturating PPFD, implying that part of the immediate energy required for inorganic N assimilation may come from intermediary metabolism. This contention was supported for NO3- assimilation by the results of experiments performed with specific inhibitors of non-cyclic photophosphorylation and oxidative phosphorylation. The KLT values for the assimilation of CO2 were from 2-10 times higher than those for inorganic N. These values for CO2 assimilation were not significantly altered by the addition of either NO3- or NH4+ during 12 h incubations.																			0142-7873	1464-3774					1984	6	5					733	749		10.1093/plankt/6.5.733	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/6.5.733													WOS:A1984TH56400002

Primary production varied from 4.1 to 28.7 g O2 m-2 d-1 with the highest values 24.2 and 28.7 g O2 m-2 d-1 recorded in the eastern and southern sectors and the lowest value 4.1 g O2 m-2 d-1 recorded in the northern sector. The seasonal means production for the lake was estimated at 13.3 g O2 m-2 d-1. Mean phytoplankton abundance ranged from 32.7 107 to 76.1 107 cells m-3 with a mean value of 48.107 cells m-3. Diatoms were the dominant phytoplankton group comprising 52 to 90% by number. The greatest relative abundance (87 to 90%) was recorded in the southern sector. Mean zooplankton abundance ranged from 30.1 103 to 44.4 103 organisms m-3 in the eastern sector to 5.5.103 in the northern sector. In response of eutrophication, the species composition changed significantly over the last 20 years. Cladocerans represented less than 1% of zooplankton during 1959/60, but 75% in 1985/86.

J	MELACK, JM				MELACK, JM			PHOTOSYNTHETIC RATES IN 4 TROPICAL AFRICAN FRESH WATERS	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Seasonal changes in photosynthetic rates of phytoplankton and underwater light in 4 Kenyan fresh waters (Lake Naivasha, Crescent Island Crater, Oloidien Lake and Winam Gulf) were measured in 1973 and 1974. Daily variations in water temperature were only slightly less than seasonal changes and complete vertical mixing usually occurred each day. Well oxygenated water from top to bottom provided evidence for daily mixing. The vertical profiles of photosynthetic rates in the 4 lakes had the familiar feature of subsurface maxima. Of the photosynthetically available radiation (PAR), 1% coincided with the limit of detection of photosynthesis in Naivasha and Crescent Island Crater. The PAR at the depth of the maximal photosynthetic rate was higher for Naivasha (mean = 1.71 einsteins(E)/m2 per h) than for Oloidien and Crescent Island Crater (means = 1.23 and 1.20 E/m2 per h, respectively). The maximal rates of photosynthesis (mg O2/m3 per h) were usually higher in Oloidien (260-750) and Winam Gulf (230-640) than in Naivasha (150-240) and were least in Crescent Island Crater (50-180). Chlorophyll-a concentrations were directly related to photosynthetic rates. Because of the inverse relation between euphotic zone depth and maximal photosynthetic rates, the areal rates varied less among the lakes than the volumetric rates (i.e., 3.0-12.1 g O2/m2 per day). The seasonal changes over a 12 mo. period in the areal photosynthetic rates ranged from a 3-fold variation in Oloidien and Crescent Island Crater to a 1.5-fold variation in Naivasha. In Winam Gulf over a 5-mo. period, a 2.3-fold variation occurred.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1979	9	6					555	571		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1979.tb01539.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1979.tb01539.x													WOS:A1979HU66600006

Suspended particles not only affect visibility and net primary productivity, as light penetration is reduced, but may also affect the ability of herbivorous zooplankton to locate and ingest food. In Swan Lake, an oligotrophic lake in northwestern Montana, the dose association between zooplankton population development and seasonal maxima in turbidity levels suggests that the community present during peak turbidity is minimally impacted by suspended sediments. This report presents the results of laboratory investigations into the effect of suspended sediments on feeding by the copepod Diaptomus ashlandii, the dominant zooplankter in Swan Lake. Ingestion rate for copepods feeding on P-32 labeled algae was significantly reduced in the presence of suspended particles at all turbidity levels tested (5 to 200 NTU's) compared to ingestion rate in the absence of suspended particles (0 NTU's).																			0091-181X						1995	26	2-4					287	294		10.1080/10236249509378947	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10236249509378947													WOS:A1995TY46700018
