J	MARTIN, NV				MARTIN, NV			LIMNOLOGICAL AND BIOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS IN THE REGION OF THE UNGAVA OR CHUBB CRATER, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC	JOURNAL OF THE FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD OF CANADA												Ungava Crater Lake, at 73[degree]41[image] W. L. and 61[degree] 17[image] N. L., lies in a meteoritic crater of the northern Quebec tundra. The lake is nearly circular, 1.7 miles in diameter, with steep walls and a maximum known depth of 825 feet. Secchi disc transparency was 35 m. Summer surface temperatures were 3-4[degree]C, of the deep water a little less. Surface oxygen was abundant, pH was 6.5-6.6. Total solids in the water were less than 20 parts per million, and hardness was only 1.7 ppm. Three kinds of mammals and 14 birds were found in the crater region. Arctic char, Salvelinus alpinus, were the only fish taken in the crater lake. Specimens up to 21.8 in. fork length and 18 years old were taken; they fed on insects and other char. Char in other nearby waters grew somewhat faster but ate the same foods; mature females as small as 4.0 in. were seen. Lake trout, Salvelinus namaycush. in a lake near the crater reach 33.5 in. and 15.8 lbs. Growth was very slow, the greatest age determined being 21 years, at 13 lbs. Twenty-nine species of vascular plants were collected close to the crater.																									1955	12	4					487	498		10.1139/f55-027	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f55-027													WOS:A1955WZ51400001

Tectonic and climatic controls on the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous stratigraphic architecture of the Xuanhua basin, North China	BASIN RESEARCH												Arguments for recognizing autogenic vs. allogenic signals in the stratigraphic record are still far from settled, as is the decoding of unsteady allogenic responses to climate vs. tectonic forcing. We offer the case of late Mesozoic Xuanhua basin in the western Yanshan fold-and-thrust belt of North China to make these points. The study area is an intramontane basin that has allowed detailed structural, sedimentological, and provenance analyses in a kilometre-thick succession (the Tuchengzi Formation) of alluvial fan, fluvial, lake-delta and lacustrine deposits. Extensive geological mapping provided confidence of near-basinwide later correlation of strata, revealing two large-scale upward-coarsening (CU) successions each 80-240 m thick, with prominent vertical changes from lacustrine through deltaic and fluvial to alluvial fan deposits. Two intervals of thrust-related growth strata identified in the Tuchengzi Fm suggest that the CU successions were the signals of tectonic uplift and accommodation change related to Likouquan and the Mapu thrusting. In the lower CU succession, there is a stacking (30+) of small-scale (3-16 m thick) upward-fining cyclothems that are argued to have been generated by alternating wet-dry climate cycles. The wet half-cycle is argued to have initiated with high sediment and water discharge of flood-generated mass flows into the lake and ended with accumulation of lacustrine mudstones as lake level rose. The lake deposits include the maximum flooding during the wet half-cycle. The dry half-cycle was characterized by continued lacustrine deposits, but increased evidence of subaerial exposure (rooting, paleosols, and mudcracks) argued to result from falling of the lake level under dry conditions.					; Liu, Shaofeng/K-7905-2012; tian, cheng/KJM-4052-2024; Lin, Chengfa/HJP-7904-2023; Steel, Ronald/B-2948-2008	Steel, Ronald J./0000-0002-6846-7788; Liu, Shaofeng/0000-0002-6667-3721; Zhu, Yinbing/0000-0002-4115-3308; 													0950-091X	1365-2117				FEB	2022	34	1					190	219		10.1111/bre.12616	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bre.12616		OCT 2021											WOS:000705601400001

Choosing the key environmental indicators is vital to the assessment of habitat suitability for migratory birds. In the study, hydroperiod was used to predict wetland suitability for migratory birds. It control growth of vegetation used for migratory birds' food and could predicted by hydrodynamic model. This study presents a new indicator for assessing migratory bird habitat suitability in wetland, continuous flooding time (CFT), based on two-dimensional (2D) hydrodynamic model and vegetation growth threshold. In Poyang Lake wetland (the largest migratory bird wintering based in Asia), variation in CFT amongst different hydrological years (wet, dry and normal flow years) was calculated by using the 2D hydrodynamic model based on incompressible Reynolds Average Navier-Stokes (N-S) equation. The habitat suitability for migratory birds were calculated based on the vegetation growth threshold (CFT) of Carex spp., Phalaris anmdinacea and Polygonum criopolitanum in the typical (hydrological) years. Results show that migratory birds have the largest suitable area (with High and Very High suitability) in 2009 (normal flow year). The suitable area in severe drought (flood) year is significantly less than the area in normal dry (wet)year. The average of the suitable CFTs (with High and Very High suitability) are almost equal in 2007 (dry year) and 2002 (wet year). The suitable CFT is between 120 and 240 days, and the average of the suitable CFT is 170.39, 190.26 and 173.49 days in 2007 (dry year), 2009 (normal flow year) and 2002 (wet year), respectively. Overall, the study provides a valuable evaluation indicator of habitat suitability for migratory bird, however the use of the indicator must depend on a certain study of the vegetation growth threshold and the feeding habit of migratory birds for the study area. The proposed indicator can further improve the comprehensive evaluation system for wetland migratory birds and provide a scientific reference of the water environment planning and ecological management for the scheduled Poyang lake dam.

Rethinking the influence of hydroelectric development on gene flow in a long-lived fish, the Lake Sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens	PLOS ONE												Many hydroelectric dams have been in place for 50 - >100 years, which for most fish species means that enough generations have passed for fragmentation induced divergence to have accumulated. However, for long-lived species such as Lake Sturgeon, Acipenser fulvescens, it should be possible to discriminate between historical population structuring and contemporary gene flow and improve the broader understanding of anthropogenic influence. On the Winnipeg River, Manitoba, two hypotheses were tested: 1) Measureable quantities of former reservoir dwelling Lake Sturgeon now reside downstream of the Slave Falls Generating Station, and 2) genetically differentiated populations of Lake Sturgeon occur upstream and downstream, a result of historical structuring. Genetic methods based on ten microsatellite markers were employed, and simulations were conducted to provide context. With regards to contemporary upstream to downstream contributions, the inclusion of length -at -age data proved informative. Both pairwise relatedness and Bayesian clustering analysis substantiated that fast-growing outliers, apparently entrained after residing in the upstream reservoir for several years, accounted for -15% of the Lake Sturgeon 525-750 mm fork length captured downstream. With regards to historical structuring, upstream and downstream populations were found to be differentiated (FST = 0.011, and 0.013-0.014 when fast-growing outliers were excluded), and heterozygosity metrics were higher for downstream versus upstream juveniles. Historical asymmetric (downstream) gene flow in the vicinity of the generating station was the most logical explanation for the observed genetic structuring. In this section of the Winnipeg River, construction of a major dam does not appear to have fragmented a previously panmictic Lake Sturgeon population, but alterations to habitat may be influencing upstream to downstream contributions in unexpected ways.					; Welsh, Amy/CAG-2274-2022	McDougall, Craig/0000-0002-3766-1617; Nelson, Patrick A./0000-0002-7144-5539; 													1932-6203					MAR 22	2017	12	3							e0174269	10.1371/journal.pone.0174269	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0174269								28329005					WOS:000399094700077

Analyses of petrologic characteristics and stable isotope composition indicate that the dolomitizing host rock is volcanic and the dolomitizing fluids probably consists of brine from shore-shallow lakes with great evaporation and salinity in the Fengcheng Formation, which have formed under arid climatic conditions, as well as residual Mg-rich seawater from the underlying Jiamuhe Formation and Carboniferous. Dust tuff in the area has significant plagioclase content. Anorthite and labradorite hydrolysis by CO2 can be coupled with calcite precipitation. Late Mg-rich brine percolated and replaced calcite formed in the early time, which lead to precipitate dolostones with different occurrences, such as graniphyric, random bedded or lumpy. The diagenetic dolostones with different occurrences resulting from particular formation conditions occurred in different tectonic settings. The dolomitizing fluid has been driven by the thermal convection flow generated by volcanic eruptions. At the same time, the overthrusts of the Wu-Xia growth fault have speeded up the flow of deep Mg-rich water upwards, and induced the water to quickly penetrate and horizontally migrate in the strata. Fracture is the major and the most important reservoir space in dolomitic reservoir of the Fengcheng Formation. Fracture and fault plays a decisive role in controlling the formation of dolostone and the distribution of favorable reservoirs. The deliverability of oil and gas is determined by the development and match relations of dissolved pores and fractures to a certain degree.

J	McCormick, MJ; Fahnenstiel, GL				McCormick, MJ; Fahnenstiel, GL			Recent climatic trends in nearshore water temperatures in the St. Lawrence Great Lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												In the Great Lakes region, the observational evidence for climatic change has been primarily limited to changes in lake-ice conditions, with no long-term trends identified in water temperatures. Seven nearshore water intake sites (Bay City, Michigan; Green Bay, Wisconsin; Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan; St. Joseph, Michigan; Sandusky Bay, Ohio; Put-In-Bay, Ohio; and Erie, Pennsylvania) in the Great Lakes were chosen, and their data were examined for any climatic trends. Regression results on the annual mean temperatures showed varying support in favor of a warming trend at five of the seven sites. A new approach facilitated determination of the interannual variability in the timing of the 4 degrees C temperature of maximum density. Two of the three sites with data records extending back to the early part of this century (Sault Ste. Marie and Put-In-Bay, respectively) showed a 4- and a 6-h yr(-1) rate of increase in the maximum potential duration of summer stratification (DSS). Over the time span of these two data sets, this equates to a 14- and 18-d increase in the potential DSS, respectively. The rate of increase in the duration data was skewed, with most of the increase due to an earlier transition to springlike conditions. Finally, the data do not extend far enough back in time to know if these climatic trends are part of an unresolvable natural cycle or forced by anthropogenic activity.

In fish, though, data on cognitive flexibility are scarce, especially in the wild. We studied a lekking species of cichlid fish in Lake Tanganyika, Aulonocranus dewindti. Males create sand bowers as spawning sites and maintain them by removing any objects falling into it. In the first part of our experiment, we investigated the existence of spontaneous decision rules for the maintenance of the bowers. We showed that if a snail shell and a stone are placed in their bower, fish prefer to remove the shell first. In the second phase of our experiment, we took advantage of this spontaneous decision rule to investigate whether this rule was flexible. We tested five individuals in a choice against preference task, in which the fish had to modify their preference rule and remove the stone first to be allowed to then remove the shell and have a clean bower. While there was no overall trend towards flexibility in this task, there was variation at an individual level. Some individuals increased their preference for removing the shell first, deciding quickly and with little exploration of the objects. Others were more successful at choosing against preference and showed behaviours suggesting self-regulatory inhibition abilities. Bower-building cichlids could therefore be a promising model to study cognitive flexibility, and other aspects of animal cognition in the wild.

Dynamics of Characteristics of Wind-Driven Surface Waves in the Coastal Zone of Lake Baikal	RUSSIAN PHYSICS JOURNAL												Experimental parameters of wind-driven waves obtained with a measuring pole near the coastal line of Lake Baikal using video recorders placed on a slightly submerged mast are analyzed in the present work. The measurements were carried out during the fall period. The short-period dynamics of the characteristics of surface wind-driven waves arising on the shallow water surface is analyzed. Dependences are established of the wave heights on the wind speed and direction in an open region of Lake Baikal in the daytime; their maxima are recorded in the second half of the day at the western wind direction. The temporal variations of the wave periods and heights are shown, and the nonlinear gravitational wave modes are detected on the shallow water surface. As a result of these processes, the short-period wave heights reach their maximum values. Radar measurements of the wind-driven wave characteristics have shown a dependence of the back-reflected signal intensities on the variations in the wind-driven wave heights. Small-scale inhomogeneities observed on the water surface in the form of ripples, responsible for backscattering of wind-driven wave crests, are well recognized with a nanosecond radar.

J	Kanaris-Sotiriou, R; Mathieson, NA; Johnson, EW; Millward, D				Kanaris-Sotiriou, R; Mathieson, NA; Johnson, EW; Millward, D			The geochemistry and significance of sills within the Ordovician Borrowdale Volcanic Group around Black Combe, SW English Lake District	PROCEEDINGS OF THE YORKSHIRE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY												The Borrowdale Volcanic Group (BVG) in the SW of the English Lake District (SWLD) consists predominantly of subaerial pyroclastic rocks that host syn-volcanic intrusions ranging in composition from basalt to dacite. The petrology and geochemistry of the sills verify a broad compatibility with the BVG in the central Lake District. The geochemistry indicates a marginal continental arc setting, a petrogenesis involving c. 15% partial melting of a 1herzolite mantle source and subsequent fractionation of olivine, ortho- and clinopyroxene, plagioclase and Fe-Ti oxide. Three groups of basaltic sills are recognized in the SWLD, one of which bears a close resemblance, geochemically, to the lower BVG (Birker Fell Formation) basaltic lavas and appears to have been emplaced early in the SWLD succession. The other two groups, which may be cogenetic, appear to be somewhat geochemically distinct from the first, with trace element and rare-earth characteristics suggesting a source slightly more enriched in incompatible elements. It is suggested that the fault-dominated tectonic setting in the Millom Park area of the SWLD may account for the least-evolved magmas being allowed to migrate directly to a high structural level, accounting for a higher proportion of basic lithologies in the upper BVG succession of the SWLD than is found in other parts of the Lake District.																			0044-0604					NOV	2002	54		2				95	110		10.1144/pygs.54.2.95	http://dx.doi.org/10.1144/pygs.54.2.95													WOS:000179886600002

This study assessed the risk of outburst floods for Guangxieco Proglacial Lake (GPL) in this Mountain Range as a typical case to reveal the effects of rapid glacial change. The area of Gongzo Glacier behind GPL decreased by 7.39 +/- 0.10% from 1987 to 2019, while this glacier advanced by 32.45 m from 5 June to 27 October in 1988. Guangxieco Proglacial Lake decreased from 0.42 +/- 0.03 km(2) in 1987 to 0.19 +/- 0.03 km(2) in 1988 and then continuously expanded to 0.43 +/- 0.04 km(2) in 2019. Heavy precipitation occurred before 15 July 1988, when no supraglacial lake existed. Meanwhile, sustained abnormally high air temperature caused accelerated glacier and snow melting. Since 1988, a larger volume of rainfall and meltwater impounded by the ice wall caused an increase in the basal water pressure in the glacier. A significant increase in winter mass balance has caused a further increase in the downward gravity component of glacier sliding. As a result, the glacier advanced rapidly while reopening previously blocked subglacial drainage systems. The accumulating subglacial water rapidly drained into the Proglacial Lake causing an elevated lake level and a GLOF event. However, the current area of the glacial lake has recovered to the scale present before the outburst in 1988. Therefore, local government agencies and the local community should improve early warning systems and take measures designed to prevent a new GLOF and to minimize the risk of a recurrence of a GPL outburst.																			0921-030X	1573-0840				2021 SEP 18	2021										10.1007/s11069-021-05029-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11069-021-05029-5		SEP 2021											WOS:000756600700001

The delta O-18 values indicate wetter conditions/more rainfall during the early Holocene from 11 to 7 thousand years before present (kyr BP). A large increase of 2 parts per thousand in delta O-18 is observed from 7.0 to 6.0 kyr BP, indicating a millennial drying period followed by drought conditions between 6.0 and 5.2 kyr BP. After a long hiatus (5.2-2.7 kyr BP), delta O-18 data show a millennium-long trend toward dry conditions. An abrupt positive change of 0.8-1.0 parts per thousand in delta O-18 is noticed between 8.29 and 8.17 kyr BP, reflecting the 8.2-ka event; however, the amplitude of the delta O-18 shift is much smaller comparing to that of the event of 6.0-5.2 kyr BP. On orbital time-scales, the TK record agrees with insolation-dominated speleothem records in the Asian-Australian monsoon realm. Noticeable inconsistencies among records in the Southeast Asia region (between 8 degrees N and 4 degrees N-8 degrees S) have been documented on multi-centennial scales. Lower delta O-18 values are likely associated with the mean position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). A new reconstruction of Holocene ITCZ shifts index within the central Indo-Pacific region, based on stalagmite delta O-18 records from Kiang Cave (8 degrees N) and Liang Luar Cave (8 degrees S), shows that the ITCZ played an important role in hydroclimate variability in the Asian-Australian monsoon regions. The southward shift of the ITCZ in the central Indo-Pacific region, controlled by the interhemispheric extratropical insolation gradient, may strongly correlate with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) activities in the Holocene.

J	Cai, Y; Ke, CQ; Duan, Z				Cai, Yu; Ke, Chang-Qing; Duan, Zheng			Monitoring ice variations in Qinghai Lake from 1979 to 2016 using passive microwave remote sensing data	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Lake ice is a sensitive indicator of climate change. Based on the disparities between the brightness temperatures of lake ice and water, passive microwave data can be used to monitor the ice variations of a lake. With focus on the analysis of long time series variability of lake ice, this study extracts four characteristic dates related to lake ice (the annual freeze start, freeze completion, ablation start and ablation completion dates) for Qinghai Lake from 1979 to 2016 using Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) and Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) passive microwave brightness temperature data. The corresponding freezing duration, ablation duration, complete freezing duration and ice coverage duration are calculated. Applying Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily snow products, the accuracy of the results derived from passive microwave data is validated. The validation analysis shows a strong agreement (R-2 ranges from 0.70 to 0.85, mean absolute error (MAE) ranges from 2.25 to 3.94 days) in the freeze start, ablation start, and ablation completion dates derived from the MODIS data and passive microwave data; the ice coverage duration also has a small error (relative error (RE) = 2.95%, MAE = 3.13 days), suggesting that the results obtained from passive microwave data are reliable. The results show that the freezing dates of Qinghai Lake have been delayed and the ablation dates have advanced. Over 38 years, the freeze start date and freeze completion date have been pushed back by 6.16 days and 2.27 days, respectively, while the ablation start date and ablation completion date have advanced by 11.24 days and 14.09 days, respectively. The freezing duration and ablation duration have shortened by 3.89 days and 2.85 days, respectively, and the complete freezing duration and ice coverage duration have shortened by 14.84 days and 21.21 days, respectively. There is a significant negative correlation between the ice coverage duration and the mean air temperature in winter. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The stable carbon and oxygen isotope signature for these rocks is well-defined in the literature and used to distinguish travertine from other continental carbonates. This work focuses on travertine occurrence from the 9-LL-02 well, Barra Velha Formation (Aptian age), Santos Basin. The sampled interval showed low delta 13C values ranging from -4.8%o to +1.4%o (VPDB) compared to the occurrences of travertine described in the literature, which present predominantly positive values due to the degassing. On the other hand, the delta 18O values vary between -4.0%o and + 1.5%o (VPDB), slightly heavier when compared to the occurrences described in the literature, whose values are usually quite negative due to the high temperatures of fluids during the formation of these rocks. The facies analysis showed facies control associated to carbon isotope fractionation, which possibly reflects the position of the facies and facies association in downstream. Although the sedimentary facies versus delta 18O values correlation is not clear, the oxygen isotope composition suggests that the fluid which originated this travertine could be colder or with higher salinity than fluids from quaternary travertines. Regarding the predominantly negative delta 13C values of the travertine from the 9-LL-02 well, it is interpreted that there are several sources which contributed to the final isotopic composition of this fluid, including CO2 from magmatic source, atmospheric source and from the bedrock, as well as an unknown source strongly depleted in 13C. Finally, based on isotopic data and petrography, we suggested that these rocks were formed in subaerial conditions from fluids rising through active faults, inherited from the rift phase of the basin, inside or near a hypersaline alkaline lake, with possible contribution from methane-seeps.

Evaporation from a small water reservoir: Direct measurements and estimates	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Knowing the rate of evaporation from surface water resources such as channels and reservoirs is essential for precise management of the water balance. However, evaporation is difficult to measure experimentally over water surfaces and several techniques and models have been suggested and used in the past for its determination. In this research, evaporation from a small water reservoir in northern Israel was measured and estimated using several experimental techniques and models during the rainless summer. Evaporation was measured with an eddy covariance (EC) system consisting of a three-dimensional sonic anemometer and a Krypton hygrometer. Measurements of net radiation, air temperature and humidity, and water temperature enabled estimation of other energy balance components. Several models and energy balance closure were evaluated. In addition, evaporation from a class-A pan was measured at the site. EC evaporation measurements for 21 days averaged 5.48 mm day(-1). Best model predictions were obtained with two combined flux-gradient and energy balance models (Penman-Monteith-Unsworth and Penman-Brutsaert), which with the water heat flux term, gave similar daily average evaporation rates, that were up to 3% smaller than the corresponding EC values. The ratio between daily pan and EC evaporation varied from 0.96 to 1.94. The bulk mass transfer coefficient was estimated using a model based on measurements of water surface temperature, evaporation rate and absolute humidity at 0.9 and 2.9 m above the water surface, and using two theoretical approaches. The bulk transfer coefficient was found to be strongly dependent on wind speed. For wind speeds below 5 m s(-1) the estimated coefficient for unstable conditions was much larger than the one predicted for neutral conditions. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The Cretaceous Continental Intercalaire in central Algeria: Subsurface evidence for a fluvial to aeolian transition and implications for the onset of aridity on the Saharan Platform	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The Lower Cretaceous Continental Intercalaire of North Africa is a terrestrial to shallow marine continental wedge deposited along the southern shoreline of the Neotethys Ocean. Today it has a wide distribution across the northern Sahara where it has enormous socio-economic importance as a major freshwater aquifer. During the Early Cretaceous major north-south trending basement structures were reactivated in response to renewed Atlantic rifting and in Algeria, faults along the El Biod-Hassi Messaourd Ridge appear to have been particularly important in controlling thickness patterns of the Lower Cretaceous Continental Intercalaire. Subsurface data from the Krechba gas field in Central Algeria shows that the Lower Cretaceous stratigraphy is subdivided into two clear parts. The lower part (here termed the In Salah Formation) is a 200 m thick succession of alluvial deposits with large meandering channels, clearly shown in 3D seismic, and waterlogged flood basins indicated by lignites and gleyed, pedogenic mudstones. The overlying Krechba Formation is a 500 m thick succession of quartz-dominated sands and sandstones whose microstructure indicates an aeolian origin, confirming earlier observations from outcrop. These interbed with brick red, highly oxidised mudstones representing deposition in temporary lakes or lagoons under an arid climate. The switch from fluvial to aeolian sedimentation at Krechba on the Saharan Platform occurred in the late Aptian and Albian and is thus synchronous to a comparable change observed by previous authors in Lower Cretaceous non-marine deposits of NE Spain. This was probably driven by a combination of sea-level fall and the northward shift of global arid belts into western Neotethys caused by oceanic rifting between Africa and South America.

Arsenic speciation and trace element analysis of the volcanic rio Agrio and the geothermal waters of Copahue, Argentina	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Surface water originating from the Copahue volcano crater-lake was analysed for total arsenic and four arsenic species: arsenite (iAs(III)), arsenate (iAs(V)), monomethylarsonic acid (MA(V)) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA(V)) and other trace elements (Fe, Mn, V, Cr, Ni, Zn). A novel in-field technique for the preconcentration and separation of four arsenic species was, for the first time, used for the analysis of geothermal and volcanic waters. Total arsenic levels along the rio Agrio ranged from <0.2-3783 mu g/l As-T. The highest arsenic levels were recorded in the el Vertedero spring (3783 mu g/l As-T) on the flank of the Copahue volcano, which feeds the acidic rio Agrio. Arsenite (H3AsO3) predominated along the upper rio Agrio (78.9-81.2% iAs(III)) but the species distribution changed at lago Caviahue and arsenate (H2AsO4-) became the main species (51.4-61.4% iAs(V)) up until Salto del Agrio. The change in arsenic species is potentially it result of an increase in redox potential and the formation of iron-based precipitates. Arsenic speciation showed a statistically significant correlation with redox potential (r=0.9697, P=0.01). Both total arsenic and arsenic speciation displayed a statistically significant correlation with vanadium levels along the river (r=0.9961, P=0.01 and r=0.8488, P=0.05, respectively). This study highlights that chemical speciation analysis of volcanic waters is important in providing ideas on potential chemical toxicity. Furthermore there is a need for further work evaluating how arsenic (and other trace elements), released in volcanic and geothermal streams/vents, impacts on both biota and humans (via exposure in thermal pools or consuming commercial drinking water).

J	del Moral, R				del Moral, Roger			The Importance of Long-Term Studies of Ecosystem Reassembly after the Eruption of the Kasatochi Island Volcano	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Kasatochi Island is a small volcanic island in the central Aleutian Islands that erupted on 7 August 2008. An interdisciplinary team visited the island and its vicinity in the summer of 2009 to describe the immediate consequences of the eruptions on terrestrial, coastal, and benthic communities. The initial effects of the eruptions on soils, oceanic waters, benthic terrain, terrestrial plants, land birds, shore birds, nesting sea birds, arthropods, marine algae, and marine invertebrates were described. This overview summarizes the conventional understanding of mechanisms that drive the reassembly of devastated ecosystems and shows how studies of Kasatochi Island may enhance our understanding of succession. The presence of residual soils and low mortality among sea birds will hasten early recovery, but significant erosion (removal of tephra and marine sediments) must occur to permit a return to a fully functional ecosystem. Long-distance dispersal over seawater will be needed to replenish the plant communities. While scavenger arthropods survived, dispersal will be needed to generate complete insect communities. Land birds were killed and their habitats destroyed, so their re-colonization awaits vegetation development. Ecosystem recovery will be facilitated by allochthonous inputs of nutrients and by plant establishment. Monitoring how the biota returns to a new equilibrium and comparisons to adjacent islands will allow tests of assembly and biogeographic theory and further our understanding of terrestrial-marine interactions. The study of Kasatochi Island's recovery will produce a valuable story of ecosystem reassembly.																			1523-0430	1938-4246				AUG	2010	42	3					335	341		10.1657/1938-4246-42.3.335	http://dx.doi.org/10.1657/1938-4246-42.3.335													WOS:000281921300010

Maximum mean daily spore release ranged from 1,461 in a synactinomyxon type to 17,979 in an echinactinomyxon. The latter type showed the maximum daily spore release by an individual worm of 80,000 spores. Synactinomyxon, aurantiactinomyxon, echinactinomyxon and raabeia all showed significantly greater spore release in the summer months. In addition, echinactinomyxon and aurantiactinomyxon types showed significantly greater spore release at 20 degreesC compared to 13 and 4 degreesC. All actinosporean types studied showed a circardian pattern of spore release with maximum numbers shed between 22.00-01.00 h, except in neoactinomyxum where maximum release occurred between 19.00-22.00 h. Myxospore release of Sphaerospora truttae from Atlantic salmon was measured monthly over five consecutive days. Mature spores were first released from 0+ salmon in November and release then peaked in May with a maximum daily estimated mean of over 25,000 spores per fish before decreasing sharply in June to a mean of < 20,000 spores. Numbers of mature spores in the kidneys of the same group of fish showed a similar temporal pattern.					; Özer, Ahmet/ABA-7298-2020	OZER, AHMET/0000-0002-2890-6766; 													1230-2821					APR	2001	46	2					103	112																WOS:000169005100004
J	Bell, HS; Ferretti, SM; Ortoski, RA				Bell, Hershey S.; Ferretti, Silvia M.; Ortoski, Richard A.			A three-year accelerated medical school curriculum designed to encourage and facilitate primary care careers	ACADEMIC MEDICINE												For the past decade there has been 44 declining medical student interest in primary care. The cause of this trend is multifactorial and includes issues of salary and indebtedness. Educational leaders have called for careful selection of medical students and the creation of three-year medical school curricula to counter these factors. On April 30, 2006, the American Osteopathic Association Commission on College Accreditation voted to approve a new accelerated curriculum at the Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine (LECOM) in Erie, Pennsylvania. This pathway accelerates the traditional four-year medical school curriculum into three calendar years. In addition to reducing the time necessary to complete medical training as a primary care physician, this pathway reduces the expense involved in obtaining a medical education. This paper describes how LECOM positioned itself to address key strategies believed to be at the heart of rekindling student interest in primary care. In the accelerated curriculum, summer vacation between the first and second medical school year is eliminated. Clinical education is streamlined by focusing on 16 rotations relevant to primary care and eliminating elective experiences. Primary care mentors are assigned at the start of medical school. Case-based capstone sessions are added throughout the clinical years to reinforce primary care concepts. Students in this curriculum are designated "primary care scholars" to recognize the fact that they are engaged in a rigorous, goal-directed curriculum. Consistent with published recommendations for increasing medical students' choice of generalist careers, a detailed description of the LECOM accelerated curriculum effort is provided.																			1040-2446	1938-808X				SEP	2007	82	9					895	899		10.1097/ACM.0b013e31812f7704	http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/ACM.0b013e31812f7704								17726403					WOS:000249171500014

Shoreline responses to rapid water level increases in Lake Michigan	GEOMORPHOLOGY												High-resolution multispectral satellite imagery was utilized to quantify shoreline recession at eleven beaches around Lake Michigan during a record-setting water level increase between 2013 and 2020. Shoreline changes during this period ranged from 20 m to 62 m, corresponding to 52-95 % of the initial beach widths. Average estimated shoreline erosion across all beaches varied from 1 % to 75 % of the observed changes, with the remainder attributed to inundation. Significant correlations were found between shoreline erosion and waverelated factors, including offshore wave power, offshore bathymetric slope, storm energy, and potential alongshore sediment transport divergence. In contrast, parameters related to cross-shore transport, such as dimensionless fall velocity, exhibited weak correlations. Additionally, the results underscore the importance of distinguishing between immediately reversible changes (inundation) and morphological changes that could be reversible over longer timescales, when assessing the impact of rising water levels. The findings also suggest that in addition to waves playing a key role in regulating shoreline changes, alongshore sediment transport processes may play a more crucial role in beach erosion during significant water level increases than cross-shore processes, challenging traditional models of beach adjustment to rising waters.					, Pengfei/P-4016-2014; Wu, Chin/C-2042-2009	Wu, Chin/0000-0001-8393-1940; Abdelhady, Hazem/0009-0002-5733-9454													0169-555X	1872-695X				APR 15	2025	475								109639	10.1016/j.geomorph.2025.109639	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2025.109639		FEB 2025											WOS:001427351400001

These three reservoirs are managed by the Public Works Department (PWD) with the fisheries aspects falling under the purview of Tamil Nadu State Fisheries Department. In each reservoir, inflow and outflow sections were identified as sampling sites. A total of six sampling sites were fixed and monthly sampling for water and fish was conducted during the period from October 2019 to June 2020. The various physico-chemical parameters such as temperature, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), total suspended solids (TSS), total volatile solids (TVS), turbidity, DO, pH, alkalinity, hardness, chloride, sulphate, biological oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were analysed. Biological parameters like chlorophyll-a and primary production as well as various nutrient parameters were also analysed in the collected water samples. All the physical and chemical water quality variables showed significant variation (p<0.05) in their concentrations within various months and between stations. All the water quality parameters were observed to be within the prescribed limits. The results indicated under-exploitation of fishes from the reservoirs and suggest ways to improve fish yields and livelihood of local fisher community.																			0970-6011						2022	69	4					28	35		10.21077/ijf.2022.69.4.125726-03	http://dx.doi.org/10.21077/ijf.2022.69.4.125726-03													WOS:000992562100003

The results indicate high affinity of the radionuclide for particulates (K(d), 1.9 x 10(5) mL g-1). Companion studies on the precursor Ra-226 give an average K(d) value of 7.8 x 10(3) mL g-1. Nearly 77% of the total Pb-210 (i.e., dissolved plus particulate) and 99% of the total Ra-226 are transported through the system in the dissolved form. The suggestion is made that the low availability of particulates in the system promotes the export of Pb-210 in the dissolved form. The conventional approach gives a mean residence time of about 2000 yr for the atmospherically-derived Pb-210 in the watershed. However, if the flux of this Pb-210 falling directly on the river's surface is taken into account, a mean residence time of about 6200 yr is inferred for this radionuclide in the area soils. This aspect of the study is largely applicable to metals with geochemical behavior similar to that of Pb-210, for the radionuclide itself has a mean life of only 32.2 yr.																			0049-6979					OCT	1991	59	3-4					311	320		10.1007/BF00211839	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00211839													WOS:A1991GP46600010
J	CLARK, CF				CLARK, CF			MOVEMENTS OF NORTHERN PIKE TAGGED IN WATERS TRIBUTARY TO LAKE ERIE	OHIO JOURNAL OF SCIENCE												Over an eight-year period, 2,659 northern pike (Esox luctius Linnaeus) were tagged along the southwestern shore of Lake Erie with monel metal round tags. Of these, 698 were recaptured one to seven years later - 553 by Division of Wildlife nets, 106 by anglers, 22 by commercial fishermen, and 17 were found dead. Sixteen were recaptured four to six times and released before they were removed from the population. Except for a few strays, most of the pike were limited in movement to the area along the shore where they were tagged. The large number of Division net returns, during the month of March (1950-1957), indicate a concentration of pike in East Harbor, or on the spawning grounds. Three pike taken in Canadian waters illustrate the small segment of the population which is highly mobile. The very few recaptures of pike by anglers and commercial fishermen in Lake Erie, and from 2,603 hours of division netting in east Harbor from June through September for eight years, suggests a minimum of movement during the hot months of the year. The congregation of breeders and number of recaptures in East Harbor during the spring, but a scarcity of them the remainder of the year, indicates a homing trend and suggests a sedentary existencefor this pike population most of the year.																			0030-0950					MAR	1990	90	1					41	45																WOS:A1990CX22100005

Radioisotopic age, formation, and preservation of Late Pleistocene human footprints at Engare Sero, Tanzania	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												We report on the radioisotopic age, formation, and preservation of a late Pleistocene human footprint site in northern Tanzania on the southern shore of Lake Natron near the village of Engare Sero. Over 400 human footprints, as well as tracks of zebra and bovid, are preserved in a series of volcaniclastic deposits. Based on field mapping along with geochemical and grain-size analyses, we propose that these deposits originated as proximal volcanic material from the nearby active volcano, Oldoinyo L'engai, and were then fluvially transported to the footprint site. Stable isotope results (delta O-18 and delta C-13) suggest that the footprints were originally emplaced on a mudflat saturated by a freshwater spring and were later inundated by the rising alkaline waters of Lake Natron. We employed the 40Ar/39Ar and C-14 dating methods to investigate the age of the site and determined that the footprint level is older than 5760 +/- 30 yrs. BP and younger than 19.1 +/- 3.1 ka. These radioisotopic ages are supported by stratigraphic correlations with previously documented debris avalanche deposits and the stable isotope signatures associated with the most recent highstand of Lake Natron, further constraining the age to latest Pleistocene. Since modern humans (Homo sapiens) were present in Africa ca. 200 ka, Engare Sero represents the most abundant and best-preserved footprint site of anatomically modern Homo sapiens currently known in Africa. Fossil footprints are a snapshot in time, recording behavior at a specific moment in history; but the actual duration of time captured by the snapshot is often not well defined. Through analog experiments, we constrain the depositional window in which the prints were made, buried, and ultimately preserved to within a few hours to days or months. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The T. japonica bed has been expanding since 2006 and covered more than 60 % of the lake's area from 2008 to 2010. However, two parts of the lake, the upper and lower areas, retained open water, even during recent years. A survey of lake-bottom sediments revealed a heterogeneous seed distribution. Although seed density exceeded 13 seeds/m(2) in the lake's central area, no seeds were observed in the upper and lower areas. A seed-bag retrieval experiment showed that 75.6 % of seeds at the upper site germinated when seeds were artificially introduced, whereas 6.7 % of seeds germinated at the lower site. These results suggest that seed dispersal opportunities are the primary limitation on the distribution of T. japonica in the upper area. Brackish water was found in springs in the lower area, reflecting an adverse inflow of water from a downstream brackish lake. Laboratory experiments revealed significant adverse effects of water salinity on germination and early growth of T. japonica. Based on these results, we concluded that the heterogeneous distribution of T. japonica within the lake was determined by a combination of two factors: limitations on seed dispersal determined by the inflowing river and harmful salinity levels caused by inflows of seawater from the Sea of Japan via a downstream brackish lake.

J	Irfanullah, HM; Moss, B				Irfanullah, HM; Moss, B			Factors influencing the return of submerged plants to a clear-water, shallow temperate lake	AQUATIC BOTANY												Lack of submerged vegetation was studied in a small, shallow, alkaline, clear-water lake with high nitrate concentration (mean 9 mg NO3-N L-1) and profuse filamentous green algae (FGA) (mainly Spirogyra sp.). A laboratory microcosm and two lake enclosure experiments were carried out using Elodea nuttallii (Planchon) St John. E. nuttallii grew about 1.7 times as well in sediment from its place of origin compared with sediment from the lake. Differential water quality had no effect, and neither sediment nor water prevented growth in the lake. Nutrient addition reduced plant growth by more than 55% because of shading from epiphytic filamentous green algae (shoot dry weight versus epiphytic algal dry weight, r = -0.491, P < 0.05). Transplanted Elodea plants grew better in enclosures in the lake than in laboratory conditions with lake water and sediment (P < 0.001, t-test). Rare Elodea individuals in the lake indicate the presence of plant propagules in the lake sediment, but excessive growth of filamentous green algae (summer mean 3.2 g dry weight m(-2)) significantly hamperd plant growth (shoot length reduced from 29 +/- S.E.M. 1 to 25 +/- 1 cm) and bird herbivory significantly reduced survival (from 82 +/- 7 to 40 +/- 6%) and shoot growth (from 78 +/- 6 to 18 5 cm) and thus eliminates establishment of even modest plant beds. Fish disturbance and sediment stability were not important. Restoration of submerged plants may require reduction of nitrate input, control of filamentous green algae and protection from birds.

Here, we examined patterns of functional redundancy among Ontario freshwater fish communities with species richness levels ranging from 4 to 30 species across lakes of differing size, depth, productivities and thermal characteristics. Location: Six thousand nine hundred and seventy-seven lakes in Ontario, Canada. Methods: We examined functional redundancy by quantifying the relationship between functional diversity and species richness in lakes across Ontario and within smaller biogeographic regions. We used null models to test whether fish communities had greater redundancy than expected from random assemblages. We then used generalized additive models (GAMs) to predict how patterns of redundancy vary across environmental variables. At last, we compared species-level functional rarity metrics across fish thermal preference groups, body sizes and species occurrence rates. Results: The functional diversity and species richness relationship were saturating among fish communities at the provincial scale but varied between smaller regions with differing biogeographic histories. Most communities fell within expectations from weighted null models of the functional diversity and species richness relationship. The GAMs indicated that fish communities in the largest, deepest and warmest lakes showed the greatest overall functional redundancy. No differences were observed in functional rarity measures between thermal preference groups, across body sizes or across species occurrence rates. Main conclusions: Although lakes in this study were relatively depauperate of fish species, Ontario fish communities exhibited functional redundancy at the provincial scale, with variation regionally. North-eastern communities showed the least saturating relationship overall as predicted by historical biogeographic patterns of freshwater fish colonization. Overall, this study provides a broad perspective of freshwater fish diversity patterns and highlights the importance of investigating redundancy from different perspectives and multiple spatial scales.					; Jackson, Donald/J-6441-2013; Lamothe, Karl/J-5386-2019	Jackson, Donald A/0000-0002-6107-0753; Alofs, Karen/0000-0002-4161-3554; Lamothe, Karl/0000-0001-9875-8204													1366-9516	1472-4642				NOV	2018	24	11					1612	1626		10.1111/ddi.12812	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ddi.12812													WOS:000448070600009
J	Hann, B; Salki, A				Hann, Brenda; Salki, Alex			Patterns in the crustacean zooplankton community in Lake Winnipeg, Manitoba: Response to long-term environmental change	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Changes in the crustacean zooplankton community composition and abundance in Lake Winnipeg (1969-2006) provide a rare opportunity to examine their response to environmental changes in the largest naturally eutrophic lake on the Canadian prairies. Since 1929, zooplankton species composition in Lake Winnipeg has changed little except for the addition of the invasive cladoceran, Eubosmina coregoni in 1994. The dominant taxa in the lake in summer include: Leptodiaptomus ashlandi, Acanthocyclops yernalis, Diacyclops thomasi, Daphnia retrocurva, Daphnia mendotae, Diaphanosoma birgei, Eubosmina coregoni, and Bosmina longirostris. Climate-accelerated nutrient loading to southern Lake Winnipeg over the last two decades has led to increased phytoplankton abundance and higher frequency of cyanobacterial blooms especially in its northern basin. Crustacean zooplankton have likewise increased especially in the North Basin, but less so in the more nutrient rich South Basin, possibly as a consequence of higher densities of pelagic planktivorous fish and light-limited primary production compared with the more transparent North basin (Brunskill et al., 1979, 1980). Calanoid copepods play a larger role in the South basin food web in contrast to cyclopoid copepods and Cladocera in the North basin. The study begins to fill the recognized gap in understanding of Lake Winnipeg's food web structure and provides a baseline for evaluating ongoing changes in the zooplankton community with the arrival of new non-indigenous taxa, e.g. Bythotrephes longimanus and Dreissena polymorpha. It reinforces previous work demonstrating that zooplankton provide valuable indices toward evaluating the health of an ecosystem. (C) 2016 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

Planktonic community metabolism in two stratified Mediterranean reservoirs with different trophic status	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Community metabolism plays a crucial role in the carbon dynamics of continental aquatic ecosystems. In the present work, two Mediterranean reservoirs (Southern Spain) with different trophic status were monitored during the stratified phase over two consecutive years (2009 and 2010) to evaluate community metabolic dynamics and potential controlling factors. Dark and light incubations were performed in order to estimate the daily rates of gross production (GP), community respiration (CR) and net community production (NCP). Temperature, irradiance, chlorophyll, phosphorus and carbon concentration were also measured at different depths within the mixed layer. On average, results showed heterotrophic behavior (GP < CR) in both reservoirs, which was particularly evident in the more eutrophic reservoir. Interannual climate variability was high due to the exceptionally rainy winter of 2010. This resulted in a significant decrease in the magnitude of the heterotrophic balance in both reservoirs. The change in NCP was especially evident in the most eutrophic reservoir where high water renewal rates lead to a lower CR. In general, NCP was found to be directly related to the ratio between the euphotic layer depth and the mixed layer depth, and inversely related to the particulate phosphorus concentration. Autotrophic behavior was only found in conditions of high irradiance (mixed layer shallower than euphotic layer), relatively low concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (<6mg L-1) and particulate phosphorus (<10g L-1), and moderate chlorophyll concentration (29g L-1), albeit these conditions did not always lead to a net autotrophic balance.

J	Cioffi, F; Gallerano, F				Cioffi, F; Gallerano, F			Response of Lake Piediluco to the change of hydrodynamic conditions and nutrient load reductions	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												In order to verify and quantify the efficacy of management strategies utilised to improve the water quality of Lake Piediluco in the long and short term, a model was developed to represent the unsteady and three-dimensional form of eutrophication processes and water anoxia phenomena. Such a model, taking into account the hydrodynamic mean and turbulent characteristic of the lake, allows the simulation of the spatial and temporal evolution of the concentration fields of the following species: (a) in water, dissolved oxygen, algal organic carbon, particulate organic carbon, dissolved organic carbon, orthophosphate, hydrogen sulphide; and (b) in sediments, dissolved oxygen, particulate organic carbon, dissolved organic carbon, orthophosphate, adsorbed phosphorus, hydrogen sulphide. This paper presents the simulation results using the following configurations characterised by: different hydraulic regimes of the lake; different external phosphorus loads introduced into the lake from discharges; different initial adsorbed phosphorus concentrations in sediments (obtainable by sediment reclaim) in certain critical areas of the lake. The simulations have detailed: (1) the characterisation of the lake's eutrophication behaviour in its present state and the vulnerability of the different areas of the lake to summer water anoxia; (2) the role of external and internal phosphorus loads on the eutrophication processes; and (3) the management options to improve the environmental conditions of the lake.

Previous study had demonstrated the importance of watershed area as a predictor of species richness of all herbs and of rarities, in particular, on lakeshores. In this study, the reciprocal of watershed area (log units) accounted for over 75% of the variation in biomass at above and below summer waterline positions. Furthermore, watershed area accounted for most of the variation in sediment organic matter content. Above the waterline, shrubs were the predominant growth form at lakes with small watershed areas; the reciprocal of watershed area accounted for 92% of shrub biomass variation. Shoreline plant communities on the lowest watershed area lake were high-biomass, shrub assemblages above waterline and low-biomass, graminoid communities below the waterline. In contrast, above the waterline but below the upper shrub zone on the high watershed area lake, shorelines supported low-biomass assemblages composed of a mixture of shrubs, graminoids, forbs, and ferns. The strong relationships found here between biomass and organic matter and lake watershed area reconcile predictive models made at the within-lake level with those made at the landscape level.

Nitrogen Dynamics: Quantifying and Differentiating Fluxes in a Riparian Wetland Soil	ACS EARTH AND SPACE CHEMISTRY												Excess nitrogen (N) originating from stormwater runoff in urban areas comes from diffuse sources and is difficult to manage and remediate. One site affected by nonpoint source pollution is Lake Keith, located in Cave Springs, Arkansas, which contains water rich in nitrate-N (5-6 mg NIL). Microdialysis, a diffusion-based sampling technique, has been recognized as a tool for collecting samples from and monitoring chemical changes in soil microsites such as the rhizosphere. Successfully using microdialysis in soil obtained from Lake Keith, an anthropogenically disturbed location that differs in physical and chemical characteristics from the soils studied in past microdialysis studies, will add to the applicability of the sampling technique and promote its establishment as a conventional soil sampling method. In this study, microdialysis was employed to investigate the dynamics of nitrogen in (1) unvegetated soil at different soil saturations and (2) in the rhizosphere of native plant species-Switchgrass ( Panicum virgatum) and Reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea). Diffusive fluxes in the Switchgrass treatment were either minimal or undetectable, and these data were complemented by the significantly decreased concentrations of nitrate-N and total N in the soil and the accumulation of plant biomass N and total biomass production. On the contrary, the Reed canarygrass treatment consistently exhibited the greatest fluxes of nitrate-N, along with decreased biomass growth. Ultimately, the microdialysis technique differentiated nitrogen dynamics in differing water saturation conditions and in the rhizospheres of two native plants, varying by functional wetland indicator status under the conditions provided by the greenhouse setting.					; Savin, Mary/HLP-6711-2023	Stenken, Julie/0000-0003-1467-9301; Maddala, Srusti/0000-0002-2485-7258; 													2472-3452					MAY 20	2021	5	5					1254	1264		10.1021/acsearthspacechem.0c00301	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsearthspacechem.0c00301		APR 2021											WOS:000655638500025

In a previous study that was undertaken on another sediment core from Lake Iseo, these layers were attributed to extreme surface runoff events. However, in this former core, large mass-wasting deposits that induce significant hiatuses did not permit a continuous record of flood events to be established. Such disturbances were absent in the core studied in the present paper. This permitted to establish a high-resolution continuous Holocene record. Based on the flood chronicle and sedimentological and XRF geochemical analyses, we found evidence of a major palaeohydrological transition at approximately 3.8 kyr cal BP, which was previously described as occurring in the western Mediterranean region. The oldest part of the record indeed presents a very low frequency of flood events (< 1 flood/century), while after 4 kyr cal BP, the flood frequency increased. This pattern appears to be in agreement with other Southern Alpine paleo flood records. The transition is interpreted as a nonlinear climate response to the orbital-driven gradual decrease in summer insolation at 60 degrees N, which together with the influence of the Mediterranean mesoscale precipitation events, is typical for the Mediterranean climate. However, the comparison of the flood record with the archaeological and historical data from the watershed suggests that human activity during the Roman period in the vicinity of the main tributaries also influenced the flood frequency. Even in a large Alpine lake and > 2000 years ago, extreme precipitation events that were recorded through the sedimentation process can hence be impacted by the anthropization of the catchment area pointing the requirement of deeper studies of Earth surface critical zone plurimillennial dynamics.

In this study, we investigated whether the effects of agricultural development on water quality differed between dimictic and polymictic lakes in a naturally nutrient-rich region of Alberta, Canada. Through a spatial limnological analysis of 36 sites, we found that the relationship between surface water total phosphorus concentration and the percent of agriculture (% Agr) in the catchments differed between dimictic and polymictic lakes, where the proportion of variance explained was much more pronounced in the dimictic (79% explained) than in the polymictic systems (7% explained). Paleolimnological analyses of subfossil chironomids in surface sediment samples (0-1 cm) from 18 of the 36 study lakes, and in sediment core profiles from the dimictic and polymictic basins of a eutrophic lake, showed that water quality differed between mixis groups. We found that the surface sediment chironomid assemblages differed significantly between polymictic and dimictic lakes. Detailed analyses of the sediment cores demonstrated that the two basin types differed in their responses to land-use change through time, as only the dimictic basin showed a parallel increase in anoxia with increasing agricultural development. We suggest that in naturally-fertile landscapes, external nutrient loading exerts a more notable effect on dimictic lakes, whereas internal nutrient loading is more important in polymictic systems.

HOLOCENE												1 Be dating of a pronounced glacier advance ('Kromer Stadial') in the western part of the Silvretta Mountains (western Austria) yielded ages ranging from 8010 +/- 360 to 8690 +/- 410 years with a mean age for moraine stabilization of 8410 +/-> 690 years. Hence, the Kromer Stadial, which was previously considered as early Preboreal, may represent the glacier response to the early phase of the '8.2-ka event', as it is recorded in the Greenland ice-cores. The glacier advanced to a position beyond its 'Little Ice Age' (LIA) limit; the end moraines are situated 750-1000 to downvalley from the glacier ends in 1850. The corresponding drop of the equilibrium line altitude relative to the LIA datum was 75 m. The glacier advance was followed by a period of glacier recession and rock glacier development. In total, the climatic fluctuation may have lasted for about 500 +/- 200 years. The age and duration of the climatic fluctuation is in good accordance with the 'Misoa cold phase' and CE-3 climatic fluctuation as recorded in Switzerland. Climate during the Kromer Stadial was characterized by more humid conditions than today along the northern fringe of the Alps and slightly negative to moderately positive changes in precipitation in the central part of the Austrian Alps. Summer temperatures changes were most likely in the order of -1 to OK. Mean annual temperature was 1.5K to 2K lower than today, at least during the second phase of the climatic fluctuation.

Ecological types are classified and units are mapped based on the associations of biotic and environmental factors which include climate, physiography, water, soils, air, hydrology, and potential natural communities. In Wisconsin, the Provinces, Sections, and Subsections of the NHFEU have been used as large scale ecological units for resource assessment and planning projects. Wisconsin created the finer "landscape" scale Landtype Association (LTA) layer of the NHFEU. The development of this important layer of information supplies a spatially oriented, ecological classification tool that is available to a variety of landowners, land managers, and resource interest groups in Wisconsin and the Lake States. A partnership in Wisconsin developed the LTA layer of the NHFEU for the entire state. Many individuals representing a diversity of forest industries and councils, environmental and landowner interest groups, private interested persons and experts, and many agencies have provided information and assistance in the development of the LTA map. A group of volunteers (Wisconsin LTA Project Team) was formed to initiate the LTA drafting work and development of an annual work plan. A first approximation for the state of Wisconsin was completed in the fall of 1999.																									2002	294						24	28																WOS:000177319100003

We monitored alewife size at age and condition (K) at several different locations in Lake Michigan during fall 1984-2001. Alewives were aged by enumerating annuli on otoliths. The results indicated that alewife length at age did not trend upward or downward between 1984 and the late 1990s but decreased from the late 1990s to 2001. Alewife weight at age was relatively constant between 1984 and the mid-1990s but decreased from the mid-1990s to 2001. Mean condition for a given alewife age was, on average, 13.7% higher during 1984-1994 than during 1995-2001. This decline in alewife condition was not a density-dependent response by the alewife population because alewife abundance trended neither upward nor downward during 1984-2001. The decline in alewife condition was possibly due to the lakewide decrease in the abundance of Diporeia spp. during the 1990s. Apparently, the availability of the large-bodied invertebrates Diporeia and Mysis spp. was an important regulator of adult alewife growth because alewives attained a substantially larger size in Lake Michigan, where these invertebrates were relatively important constituents of the adult alewife diet, than in Lake Ontario, where these invertebrates were not readily eaten by adult alewives. For age-2 or older females, mean length was 2-9 mm greater than for males. Alewife size at age and condition were slightly higher on the eastern side of Lake Michigan than on the western side.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				NOV	2003	132	6					1104	1116		10.1577/T02-133	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T02-133													WOS:000186618100006
J	Lott, JP; Willis, DW; Lucchesi, DO				Lott, JP; Willis, DW; Lucchesi, DO			Relationship of food habits to yellow perch growth and population structure in South Dakota lakes	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												We compared summer yellow perch (Perca flavescens) food habits among a wide range of perch population types in six South Dakota lakes. Chironomids were a major dietary component in all populations with mean relative importance (RI) values ranging from 29 to 55. Corixids were a major diety component for high-quality (large proprtion of fish greater than or equal to 200 mm TL) yellow perch populations, with mean RI values ranging from 22 to 26. Zooplankters were important sources of prey for yellow perch in low-quality (low proportion of fish greater than or equal to 200 mm TL) populations, with mean RI values ranging from 35 to 51. The fast growth of yellow perch in high-quality populations was attributable to a diet in which macroinvertebrates, specifically chironomids, amphipods and corixids, were the primary prey. Fish were not a substantial component of yellow perch diets in situations were perch attained large size (greater than or equal to 300 mm) and experienced fast growth. A significant negative correlation existed between yellow perch mean back-calculated length at age 3 and the mean RI of zooplankton (r=-0.87, P=0.02). The mean RI of macroinvertebrates was positively correlated with yellow perch growth rates (r=0.86, P=0.03) while there was not a significant correlation between the mean RI of fish and perch growth rates (r=0.66, P=0.16).

J	Kemp, J; Jenkins, GP; Swearer, SE				Kemp, Jodie; Jenkins, Gregory P.; Swearer, Stephen E.			The reproductive strategy of red cod, Pseudophycis bachus, a key prey species for high trophic-level predators	FISHERIES RESEARCH												The reproductive strategy of red cod, Pseudophycis bachus. was investigated as a contribution towards understanding the population dynamics of this important prey species in the shelf waters of Australia. Gonad organization and development revealed that red cod gametes are produced annually, and fertilization occurs externally. Histological observations revealed that imminent spawning was characterized by yolked, hydrated and migrated nucleus stage oocytes in females and an abundance of spermatozoa in males. Seasonal changes in gamete development and somatic indices for females and males were asynchronous. Seasonal changes in reproductive development together with somatic indices revealed that the main spawning period for red cod was during spring (September to November). While individuals in spawning condition were observed as early as April, spawning activity was most prevalent during September. Individuals in spawning condition were observed in the shelf waters of Bass Strait off the mainland ports of Queenscliff, San Remo and Lakes Entrance. The condition of all individuals collected from the shallow waters of Port Phillip Bay and Western Port was immature or undergoing maturation. Red cod spawn in shelf and slope waters, larvae are recruiting to coastal environments, and early juveniles are found in both bay and coastal environments. Early juvenile red cod were present in Western Port as early as October, and were present within the bay for a substantial part of the first year of growth. Mean size at sexual maturity was 315 and 340 mm total length for females and males, respectively, resulting in an age at sexual maturity of 1+. This suggests that movement of this species from bay and coastal environments to deeper waters during the first year of growth may depend substantially on reproduction. Red cod have a high annual fecundity (between 0.363 million and 5.059 million oocytes per fish) which was positively correlated with total length and gutted weight. Predation pressure is important in structuring ecosystem trophic interactions, and consumption of red cod by a range of high trophic level predators may be significant in shaping the dynamics in red cod populations. A reproductive strategy that is characterized by early maturity and high fecundity, coupled with a particularly fast growth rate, suggests that red cod populations are quite resilient to increased predation pressure.

Phosphorus sources and demand during summer in a eutrophic lake	AQUATIC SCIENCES												In pelagic systems, phytoplankton biomass may remain abundant or near equilibrium while concentrations of the limiting nutrient are below detection. In eutrophic lakes, it has been thought that episodic algal blooms are due to mixing events that break down this equilibrium by adding nutrients to the mixed layer. Alternatively, rapid rates of biotic recycling among primary producers and heterotrophic consumers could maintain high phytoplankton biomass, yet the recycling process has been difficult to observe in situ. Here we use free-water oxygen measurements and an associated metabolic model to infer rates of phosphorus (P) uptake and biotic mineralization in the epilimnion of a eutrophic lake. The rates of uptake and mineralization were compared to "external" sources of P such as loading and entrainment. Also, model results were assessed using sensitivity analysis. We found that the majority of phytoplankton P demand during the period of low P availability could be accounted for by biotic mineralization, but that it was important to consider the effects of entrainment in order to account fully for P uptake. These general results were relatively insensitive to model parameterization, though the relative C:P ratio of material taken up versus mineralized was an important consideration. This study integrates modeling and measurement tools that monitor ecosystem processes at finer temporal resolution than has previously been possible, complementing other studies that use experimental incubation and elemental tracers. Extension of this approach could enhance models that aim to integrate biological and physical processes in assessment of water quality and prediction of phytoplankton biomass.

We used modeled water temperature data and fish assemblage samples from 371 stream sites in Michigan and Wisconsin to define, describe, and map coolwater streams and their fish assemblages. We defined coolwater streams as ones having summer water temperatures suitable for both coldwater and warmwater species and used the observed distributions of the 99 fish species at our sites to identify coolwater thermal boundaries. Coolwater streams had June-through-August mean water temperatures of 17.0-20.5 degrees C, July mean temperatures of 17.5-21.0 degrees C, and maximum daily mean temperatures of 20.7-24.6 degrees C. We delineated two subclasses of coolwater streams: "cold transition" (having July mean water temperatures of 17.5-19.5 degrees C) and "warm transition" (having July mean temperatures of 19.5-21.0 degrees C). Fish assemblages in coolwater streams were variable and lacked diagnostic species but were generally intermediate in species richness and overlapped in composition with coldwater and warmwater streams. In cold-transition streams, coldwater (e.g., salmonids and cottids) and transitional species (e.g.. creek chub Semotilus atromaculatus, eastern blacknose dace Rhynichthys atratulus, white sucker Catostomus commersonii, and johnny darter Etheostoma nigrum) were common and warmwater species (e.g., ictalurids and centrarchids) were uncommon: in warm-transition streams warmwater and transitional species were common and coldwater species were uncommon. Coolwater was the most widespread and abundant thermal class in Michigan and Wisconsin, comprising 65% of the combined total stream length in the two states (cold-transition streams being more common than warm-transition ones). Our approach can be used to identify and characterize coolwater streams elsewhere in the temperate region, benefiting many aspects of fisheries management and environmental protection.					; Wang, Lizhu/AAG-7481-2021	Wehrly, Kevin/0009-0009-5722-1051; 													0275-5947	1548-8675				AUG	2009	29	4					1130	1151		10.1577/M08-118.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M08-118.1													WOS:000272025000027

In this study, the life-history trade-offs of the dominant cladoceran, Diaphanosoma brachyurum (Lievin, 1848) were studied in Lake Piaseczno (Poland). Size at maturity (SAM), the proportion of ovigerous females, brood size, and the depth-selection behaviour of D. brachyurum were determined. The contribution of D. brachyurum and of other cladocerans to the diet of fish was also quantified. The investigation showed that fecundity was low, and that the species did not perform diel vertical migrations. The results obtained further indicate that D. brachyurum, in contrast to other cladocerans recorded from the lake, was not affected by fish predation, as the fish appeared to ignore this species. Thus, although D. brachyurum did not exhibit any apparent life-history trade-offs, it must have profited from fish predation pressure reducing the density of competitive cladoceran populations, which might well be indicated by the fact that D. brachyurum densities rose in correlation with an increased predation pressure of fish in early summer, on (a significant part of) the remaining species of cladocerans.

FACTORS INFLUENCING ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS OF OVERWINTERED WATERBIRDS IN PARISHAN INTERNATIONAL WETLAND IN IRAN	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Parishan International Wetland, an Iranian Ramsar Site in Fars Province, is one of the two demonstration sites for the UNDP/GEF Conservation of Iranian Wetlands Project. The aim of this study was to examine the factors influencing water bird abundance, density, the number of species, and species richness in Parishan wetland from 1991 to 2010. We used remote sensing techniques to study some environmental factors affecting waterbirds community. Spearman's Correlation Coefficient and linear regression were also used to examine the impact of environmental factors on the community of waterbirds. The results showed that only the nearest wetland area was significantly correlated with abundance and density of species (p < 0.01). Also, the vegetation cover surface of wetland (P < 0.01); the deepest depth of wetland (P < 0.01); and the areas shallower than 1m (P < 0.05) were significantly correlated with the number and richness of species (Margalef Index). The Resulting models of the backward multiple regression test also indicated that the nearest wetland area was a good predictor of abundance (P value < 0.01) and density of waterbirds (P value < 0.05). Furthermore, the vegetation cover surface of wetland, was a good predictor of the number of species (P value<0.01) and of the richness species based on Margalef Index (P value<0.01). The area of the Parishan wetland has fallen very low in 2010 and reducing the area of the wetland has led to a sharp decrease in the number of birds in the wetland.					; Faculty, Natural/K-7329-2019; morshedi, jafar/AAO-6214-2021; Naderi, Morteza/K-8868-2013	Naderi, Morteza/0000-0002-7578-4159; 													1589-1623	1785-0037					2017	15	4					1565	1579		10.15666/aeer/1504_15651579	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/1504_15651579													WOS:000419994800102

Carriere) rain forests of southern British Columbia. High-resolution analysis of macroscopic charcoal from lake sediment cores, along with 102 accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) ages on soil charcoal, was used to reconstruct the long-term fire history around two subalpine lakes in the southern Coast and North Cascade Mountains. AMS ages on soil charcoal provide independent evidence of local fire around a lake and support the interpretation of peaks in lake sediment charcoal as distinct fire events during the Holocene. Local fires are rare, with intervals ranging from centuries to several millennia at some sites. Overall fire frequency varied continuously throughout the Holocene, suggesting that fire regimes are linked to climate via large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns. Fires were frequent between I 1000 and 8800 calendar years BP during the warm and dry early Holocene. The onset of humid conditions in the mid-Holocene, as rain forest taxa established in the region, produced a variable fire period until 3500 calendar years BP. A synchronous decrease in fire frequency from 3500 to 2400 calendar years BP corresponds to Neoglacial advances in the region and cool humid climate. A return of frequent fire between 2400 and 1300 calendar years BP suggests that prolonged summer drought occurred more often during this interval, which we name the Fraser Valley Fire Period. The present-day fire regime was established after 1300 calendar years BP.					; Hallett, Douglas/G-4968-2011	MATHEWES, ROLF/0000-0001-7637-199X; 													0045-5067	1208-6037				FEB	2003	33	2					292	312		10.1139/X02-177	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/X02-177													WOS:000181528600012
J	LAIR, N				LAIR, N			DISTRIBUTION OF FRESH-WATER ZOOPLANKTON COMMUNITIES	ANNEE BIOLOGIQUE												The structural and functional organization of the zooplankton communities, living in different lakes, was evaluated by comparison between theoretical distribution Of MACARTHUR, MOTOMURA and PRESTON'S models and observed data. Each of them corresponding to a particular ecological pattern, we observed changes in relation with environmental variables. Distributions Of MOTOMURA were more frequent and the changes in distributions were observed according a hierarchical order as a consequence of dynamic equilibrium. Essentially during winter the communities living in oligotrophic lakes were disorganized in association with PRESTON fits and low Eveness. From the oligotrophic to the eutrophic state, their is an increase in the complexity of the organisation, in a hierarchical order, the changes in organisation being shorter in eutrophic lakes. More the communities are stable less are their cost for existence. In relation with, the parameter gamma of Mandelbrot's model, indicating the management of such communities tended to a value near from optimum when MACARTHUR or MORTOMURA abundance distributions occured. The maximum values of this parameter were observed in lakes which had been disturbed in regard with unusual environmental conditions. In oligotrophic lakes, the interrelationships between phytoplankton and zooplankton seemed to be mutual and benefit, or we observed a temporal destructuring in zooplankton. Opposite, in eutrophic lakes, the energy transfers were in most cases detrimental to phytoplankton.																			0003-5017					SEP	1992	31	3					137	163																WOS:A1992KA88600002

The Yellow River National Wetland in Baotou, China, is an essential migration station and a source of energy for migratory birds as it is located at an important intersection between East Asian/Australian and Central Asian flyways. From February to may 2020, we measured diet composition and energy content of whooper swans (Cygnus cygnus) by fecal micro-tissue analysis to understand their use of the stopover site and inform conservation. The following results were obtained: (1) whooper swans mainly fed on nine species of plants belonging to four families, including corn (Zea mays), reeds (Phragmites australis), and Suaeda (Suaeda glauca), which is related to the availability of local crops and abundance of plants. (2) The energy provided by crops to whooper swans was significantly higher than that of the most abundant plants in wetlands. Zea mays was the most consumed crop, and other abundant wetland plants played complementary roles. (3) The daily energy intake of whooper swans was 1393.11 kJ, which was considerably higher than their daily energy consumption. This suggested that the wetlands and the surrounding farmlands provide energy for the whooper swans to continue their migration. In order to protect migratory whooper swans, protection of important refuelling areas such as our study site should be implemented to provide sufficient energy supplies for continuing migration.

Long-term primary production trends in the Laurentian Great Lakes: a comparison of geochemical methods	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Sediment cores from 12 locations throughout the Laurentian Great Lakes basin were analyzed for geochemical indicators of primary production. Sediment analytes included organic and inorganic contents, carbonates, sediment accumulation rates, total organic carbon and nitrogen concentrations, carbon and nitrogen isotope composition, and trends in spectroscopically inferred chlorophyll a (and its main diagenetic products). When multiple indicators were considered, production records related to recent cultural eutrophication and catchment activities were clear in the paleorecords. Indicators derived from loss-on-ignition (organic and inorganic content) were strongly associated with periods of human settlement in the catchments that increased overall sediment loads to the lakes. The ratio of carbon to nitrogen tracked catchment inputs of carbon, especially during periods of watershed development in western Lake Superior. Sediment records such as chlorophyll a and delta C-13(org) appear to be reliable indicators of trends in past algal abundance, particularly in Lake Erie, which has a well-known history of higher production and cultural eutrophication. These analytes also correlated well with past measured water quality surrogates for lake primary productivity and stressor data such as human populations in adjacent watersheds. A comparison among indicators revealed that several show redundancy as good proxies of production or productivity, though context was important. For instance, heavier isotopes of carbon and nitrogen are often prescribed as sedimentary indicators of lake productivity, but these two analytes were negatively correlated in Lake Superior, possibly due to long-term increases in cyanobacteria or changes in the nitrogen source. An increase in sediment carbonates can indicate summer blooms of cyanobacteria (a phenomenon that was clearly apparent in Lake Ontario) or catchment erosion. To make convincing geochemical inferences of primary production in the Great Lakes, it is recommended that a weight of evidence be built through the use of multiple indicators.					; Smol, John/A-8838-2015; Meyer-Jacob, Carsten/B-8248-2014; Cai, Meijun/OKT-2059-2025	Reavie, Euan/0000-0001-8871-5809; Cai, Meijun/0000-0001-5081-131X; Meyer-Jacob, Carsten/0000-0002-8208-496X; Werne, Josef/0000-0002-7019-6024; Smol, John/0000-0002-2499-6696													0921-2728	1573-0417				MAR	2021	65	3					299	314		10.1007/s10933-020-00170-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-020-00170-w		JAN 2021											WOS:000604828400001
J	Gliwicz, ZM; Rutkowska, AE; Wojciechowska, J				Gliwicz, ZM; Rutkowska, AE; Wojciechowska, J			Daphnia populations in three interconnected lakes with roach as the principal planktivore	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Data on two co-existing Daphnia species, D.cucullata (G.O.Sars) and D.hyalina (Leydig), from three neighboring and interconnected lakes in northern Poland, revealed an extremely confined range of population density fluctuations throughout summer in each of the two species in each of the three lakes, with D.cucullata being an order of magnitude more abundant than D.hyalina (mean of 11.5 ind. l(-1) for D.cucullata and 1.1 ind. l(-1) for D.hyalina with 95% confidence limits of +/-2.5 and +/-0.5 ind. l(-1), respectively), in spite of markedly changing fecundity. There was no apparent phase of decline or increase that could br related to the distinct phases of low or high fecundity resulting from different food levels. Analysis of the gut contents of roach (Rutilus rutilus), the dominant planktivore in the three lakes, revealed identical selectivity for each of the two Daphnia species, suggesting that the lower density of the D.hyalina population was compensated for by the greater conspicuousness of individuals of this species. It is concluded that the population density of these Daphnia species remains far below the carrying capacity of the habitat and does not depend on food levels. Food availability merely sets the rate of population increase, while the actual population density in the lakes studied reflects the species' vulnerability to predation by planktivorous fish.																			0142-7873	1464-3774				AUG	2000	22	8					1539	1557		10.1093/plankt/22.8.1539	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/22.8.1539													WOS:000088700500008

The stable isotopic composition of water in different compartments was used as a tracer of hydrological processes and connectivity at the water track catchment scale. Elevated tundra patches underlain by sandy loams were disconnected from the stream and stored precipitation water from previous months in saturated soil horizons with low hydraulic conductivity. At the catchment surface and in the water track thalweg, some circular hollows, from 0.2 to 0.4 m in diameter, acted as evaporative basins with low deuterium excess (d-excess) values, from 2 parts per thousand to 4 parts per thousand. Observed evaporative loss suggests that these hollows were disconnected from the surface and shallow subsurface runoff. Other hollows were connected to shallow subsurface runoff, yielding d-excess values between 12 parts per thousand and 14 parts per thousand, close to summer precipitation. 'Connected' hollows yielded a 50% higher dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content, 17.5 +/- 5.3 mg/L, than the 'disconnected' hollows, 11.8 +/- 1.7 mg/L. Permafrost distribution across the landscape is continuous but highly variable. Open taliks exist under fens and hummocky depressions, as revealed by electric resistivity tomography surveys. Isotopic evidence supports upward subpermafrost groundwater migration through open taliks under water tracks and fens/bogs/depressions and its supply to streams via shallow subsurface compartment. Temporal variability of isotopic composition and DOC in water track and a major river system, the Vorkuta River, evidence the widespread occurrence of the described processes in the large river basin. Water tracks effectively drain the tundra terrain and maintain xeric vegetation over the elevated intertrack tundra patches.

In this study, we present V, Cr, Ni, Cu, Co, Sn, Zn, Cd, and Pb concentrations measured in a 38 cm long sediment core from the Upper Lake (wetland protected under Ramsar convention 2002) in Bhopal to provide the last century records of heavy metal pollution in Central India. Few riverine sediments and free-fall atmospheric dust samples collected from the lake periphery were also analyzed. Principal component analysis and heavy metal abundance patterns in the lake sediments and the likely endmembers suggest atmospheric deposition as the major cause of heavy metal influx into the lake. The geochemical background upper limits of heavy metals as determined using modal analysis were used to calculate the metal-specific enrichment factor (EF) and the overall heavy metal pollution load index (PLI). The overall metal pollution has remained insignificant (PLI similar to 1) throughout the core history, while minor pollution of Zn, Cd, and Pb (EF > 1-2) emerged in the early-1980s. This study highlights that the emergence of Zn, Cd, and Pb pollution in Central India is contemporaneous to that seen in multiple lacustrine sediment records from China but it does not yet show any modern phasing-out trend as seen in China and elsewhere.					; Singh, Satinder Pal/OAJ-5580-2025	Singh, Satinder/0000-0001-7510-5980; Ahmad, Nafees/0000-0001-6514-6674; 													1866-6280	1866-6299				AUG	2023	82	15							369	10.1007/s12665-023-11063-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-023-11063-2													WOS:001034407700001

To assess the suspended sediment concentrations in oceans, lakes, rivers, and coastal waterways remotely sensed spectral radiant energy collected by satellite sensors can offer a different, synoptic, quick, and affordable technique. Therefore, various sentinel-2 satellite band functions after observing spectral signature of suspended sediments in Mula dam reservoir were calibrated against observed SSC at various locations in Mula dam reservoir located at Rahuri, Maharashtra during October 2021 and February 2022. Observed SSC ranged between 15.62 and 137.65 mg/L during this period. Widely used linear, power, quadratic, exponential and logarithmic functions of various band combinations/ratios were calibrated using 80% data set. Best performing power function of (Red + Green) / 2 (R-2=0.8), Red + NIR (R-2=0.79), polynomial function of Red / Blue (R-2=0.71) and logarithmic function of Red Edge 1/ Blue (R-2=0.62) were further validated to estimate SSC. Estimated SSC and observed SSC of validation dataset were compared using visual interpretation and further subjected to linear regression t-test and student t-test. Statistical error and efficiency models (Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE)) were applied after validation to find out most suitable band combination for estimation SSC in Mula dam reservoir. Power function of (Red + Green / 2) with R-2=0.73, RMSE = 16.185, NSE=0.728 and MAPE = 26.70 % of validation is selected for spatio-temporal mapping of SSC in Mula dam reservoir. The results demonstrate that the applicability of calibration/validation technique developed for the empirical modelling of suspended sediment in Mula dam reservoir using high resolution sensor. Temporal variation of SSC over the period of six months shows the increased SSC towards the portion where river enters the reservoir than in the central portion of reservoir. Moreover, average SSC in Mula dam reservoir immediately after rainy season (October month) was found more than that in summer months. This highlights the applicability of SSC mapping using empirical band function.																			1582-9596	1843-3707				FEB	2023	22	2					375	387		10.30638/eemj.2023.029	http://dx.doi.org/10.30638/eemj.2023.029													WOS:001004192800014

Interaction effects of zooplankton and CO2 on phytoplankton communities and the deep chlorophyll maximum	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Studies examining the consequences of increased partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) in freshwater ecosystems associated with climate change have focused on direct effects for phytoplankton, showing increases in primary productivity, biomass or altered composition. However, in lakes, phytoplankton dynamics are also regulated by zooplankton predation and thermal stratification which can lead to a concentration of phytoplankton biomass in a deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) layer, making the response to CO2 increase important to understand here. Mesocosm experiments were conducted in a meso-oligotrophic north temperate lake with a strong summer phytoplankton DCM, to estimate the independent and interaction effects of zooplankton grazing and elevated pCO(2) on water column phytoplankton communities and on DCM characteristics. Interaction of CO2 effects with zooplankton grazing occurred for three of four phytoplankton spectral groups, influencing water column phytoplankton biomass. Zooplankton selective grazing appeared as important as CO2 concentration in controlling phytoplankton population and biomass. Unexpectedly, CO2 had an overall negative effect on phytoplankton total biomass despite positive productivity responses. Elevated CO2 led to more peaked (stronger vertical gradient) mid-water column chlorophyll distribution, but to smaller DCM peaks overall. Zooplankton had unexpected effects, inducing clustering of more edible phytoplankton and greater temporal variation in the DCM.

Total Mercury and Methylmercury Response in Water, Sediment, and Biota to Destratification of the Great Salt Lake, Utah, United States	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Measurements of chemical and physical parameters made before and after sealing of culverts in the railroad causeway spanning the Great Salt Lake in late 2013 documented dramatic alterations in the system in response to the elimination of flow between the Great Salt Lake's north and south arms. The flow of denser, more-saline water through the culverts from the north arm (Gunnison Bay) to the south arm (Gilbert Bay) previously drove the perennial stratification of the south arm and the existence of oxic shallow brine and anoxic deep brine layers. Closure of the causeway culverts occurred concurrently with a multiyear drought that resulted in a decrease in the lake elevation and a concomitant increase in top-down erosion of the upper surface of the deep brine layer by wind-forced mixing. The combination of these events resulted in the replacement of the formerly stratified water column in the south arm with one that was vertically homogeneous and oxic. Total mercury concentrations in the deep waters of the south arm decreased by approximately 81% and methylmercury concentrations in deep waters decreased by roughly 86% due to destratification. Methylmercury concentrations decreased by 77% in underlying surficial sediment, whereas there was no change observed in total mercury. The dramatic mercury loss from deep waters and methylmercury loss from underlying sediment in response to causeway sealing provides new understanding of the potential role of the deep brine layer in the accumulation and persistence of methylmercury in the Great Salt Lake. Additional mercury measurements in biota appear to contradict the previously implied connection between elevated methylmercury concentrations in the deep brine layer and elevated mercury in avian species reported prior to causeway sealing.

This study tested the spatial resolution at which this general observation occurs, by selecting areas with different anthropogenic pressures (urbanization) along a latitudinal gradient in Lake Garda, a deep and wide pen-Alpine lake. The sampling design aimed to detect differences in diatom distribution in terms of,species diversity, quality indices, proportion of Red List taxa, assemblages, and individual species. Because the extent to which diatom assemblages respond to these gradients was unknown, we used assemblage metrics of different sensitivities. Results showed that the most important environmental factor was the latitudinal gradient, which was revealed by almost all the assemblage metrics. This dominant trend was explained by two co-occurring environmental gradients: concentration of nutrients and thermal gradient. The importance of different levels of urbanization was unevenly partitioned among locations and latitudes because of the different intensities of urbanization pressure. Only the species Brachysira neglectissima, the quality index (Trophic Index), and to a lesser extent, the metric at assemblage level revealed significant effects. Overall, this study comes to two main conclusions: (1) different metrics are needed to detect the multifaceted effects of anthropogenic disturbances, which by their very nature are unevenly distributed and of different intensities, and therefore affect assemblages to different degrees: (2) for any monitoring program in this lake to be effective, the various gradients revealed in this work should be taken into account. Failing to include these sources of variability might lessen the benefits of monitoring					; Cantonati, Marco/G-4278-2018	Cantonati, Marco/0000-0003-0179-3842; Spitale, Daniel/0000-0002-3955-9157; 													1129-5767	1723-8633					2011	70	2					197	208		10.4081/jlimnol.2011.197	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2011.197													WOS:000294320400005

Late Pleistocene-Holocene geochemical history inferred from Lake Tecocomulco sediments, Basin of Mexico, Mexico	GEOCHEMICAL JOURNAL												This paper presents stratigraphy, mineralogy, multi-element geochemistry, organic and inorganic carbon contents ill the sediments along a 255 cm long depth profile from Lake Tecocomulco in the north-eastern part of the Basin of Mexico. Mineralogical abundance, elemental ratios, chemical index of alteration (CIA), abundance of CO3 and C-org divide the depth profile into geochemical zones and provide insight to the volcanic eruptions and phases of different paleohydrological events during the last 31,000 C-14 yr BP. The dacite to rhyolite air fall tephra pre-date the LGM (ca. 31,000 C-14 yr BP) and might be from a Plinian eruption event at the Tlaloc volcano located at 60 km in the south-west of the lake. The lake sediments are characterized by higher CIA values and metal contents between ca. 30,000-29,000 C-14 yr BP. Between ca. 28,000-25.700 C-14 yr BP, sediments have lower CIA values and contain easily weatherable amphiboles. Abundant calcite and low CIA suggest arid conditions during ca. 25,700 and ca. 16,300 C-14 yr BP, respectively. Between ca. 16,300 and 3.300 C-14 yr BP, the sediments show lower CIA and sediments of the last ca. 3,300 C-14 yr BP show highest CIA, C-org, and higher metal contents. Given the regional nature of this record, we interpret the geochemical history at Lake Tecocomulco in terms of variable precipitation, inflow and aeolian activity.					; P, Dr.Gopinathan/O-2348-2018	Lozano Santacruz, Rufino/0000-0002-6341-8039; Roy, Priyadarsi D./0000-0003-3284-8762; Caballero, Margarita/0000-0001-5691-0773													0016-7002	1880-5973					2009	43	1					49	64		10.2343/geochemj.1.0006	http://dx.doi.org/10.2343/geochemj.1.0006													WOS:000263751200005
J	Magyari, E; Vincze, I; Orbán, I; Bíró, T; Pál, I				Magyari, Eniko; Vincze, Ildiko; Orban, Ildiko; Biro, Tamas; Pal, Ilona			Timing of major forest compositional changes and tree expansions in the Retezat Mts during the last 16,000 years	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												This paper focuses on the Late Glacial (LG) and Holocene regional and local establishment times of several tree and shrub species in the Retezat Mountains (South Carpathians) using pollen, stomata and plant macrofossil records from four lakes situated at different altitudes. We used the empirical and rational pollen percentage limits to infer the local presence and population expansion/recession times. Our results show that Pinus mugo and P. sylvestris spread first at 15,100 cal yr BP in the mountain. P. mugo arrived at high altitudes (1740 m) already at 13,600 cal yr BP. The expansion of Larix decidua was weakly recorded in the pollen diagrams, but the plant macrofossil and stomata records suggested its Late Glacial expansion mainly on the northern slope and local presence since 14,900 cal yr BP at 1740 m. The species likely went extinct in the Late Holocene (around 3330 cal yr BP). The expansion of Picea abies and Ulmus commenced earlier on the southern slope, from 15,200 to 14,400 cal yr BP respectively, compared to the northern slope, where these species expanded from 14,300 to 13,850 cal yr BP. The following step was the expansion of Quercus at 13,900 cal yr BP. Following the Younger Dryas decrease of temperate deciduous taxa and P. abies, their expansion on the northern flank was in the order of P. abies (11,750), Ulmus (11,600), Quercus (11,100), Corylus (10,600), Carpinus betulus (7100), Abies alba (5100) and Fagus sylvatica (5000 cal yr BP). Timing of the Early Holocene tree expansions on the southern flank is ambiguous due to uncertainties in the Early Holocene age-depth model of Lake Lia; however, the mid-Holocene expansion of C. betulus and A. alba were well-dated in both southern slope pollen records to 7700 and 6100 cal yr BP, respectively, and we inferred several hundred years earlier expansion on the southern flank that can be explained by climatic differences. Higher solar radiation results in longer growing seasons and milder winters on the southern flank, which likely facilitated the earlier spread of these trees. For several woody taxa studied in this paper, last glacial maximum refugial populations can be inferred either locally in the mountain (P. abies, P. mugo, P. sylvestris, L. decidua) or in the region (Quercus, Ulmus, C. betulus, F. sylvatica) on the basis of their pollen presence since at least 15,700-16,000 cal yr BP and early increase during the LG. We compared the pollen inferred population expansion times of several tree taxa along a south-north transect in the Romanian Carpathians, and found that the Early Holocene high altitude expansion of A. alba (10,650-9400 cal yr BP) is exceptional in the region. We also demonstrated that the Holocene mass expansion of Quercus and C. avellana started earliest in the Retezat, and at least two centuries later in other sites in the Romanian Carpathians. We also demonstrated that certain tree species had preference for survival and/or early expansion on the northern slopes (A. alba, L. decidua, F. sylvatica), while others on the southern slopes (C. avellana, C. betulus).

Vegetation and environmental responses to climate forcing during the Last Glacial Maximum and deglaciation in the East Carpathians: attenuated response to maximum cooling and increased biomass burning	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The Carpathian Mountains were one of the main mountain reserves of the boreal and cool temperate flora during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) in East-Central Europe. Previous studies demonstrated Lateglacial vegetation dynamics in this area; however, our knowledge on the LGM vegetation composition is very limited due to the scarcity of suitable sedimentary archives. Here we present a new record of vegetation, fire and lacustrine sedimentation from the youngest volcanic crater of the Carpathians (Lake St Anne, Lacul Sfanta Ana, Szent-Anna-to) to examine environmental change in this region during the LGM and the subsequent deglaciation. Our record indicates the persistence of boreal forest steppe vegetation (with Pinus, Betula, Salix, Populus and Picea) in the foreland and low mountain zone of the East Carpathians and Juniperus shrubland at higher elevation. We demonstrate attenuated response of the regional vegetation to maximum global cooling. Between similar to 22,870 and 19,150 cal yr BP we find increased regional biomass burning that is antagonistic with the global trend. Increased regional fire activity suggests extreme continentality likely with relatively warm and dry summers. We also demonstrate xerophytic steppe expansion directly after the LGM, from similar to 19,150 cal yr BP, and regional increase in boreal woodland cover with Pinus and Betula from 16,300 cal yr BP. Plant macrofossils indicate local (950 m a.s.1.) establishment of Betula nana and Betula pubescens at 15,150 cal yr BP, Pirzus sylvestris at 14,700 cal yr BP and Larix decidua at 12,870 cal yr BP. Pollen data furthermore support population genetic inferences regarding the regional presence of some temperate deciduous trees during the LGM (Fagus sylvatica, Coiylus avellana, Fraxinus excelsior). Our sedimentological data also demonstrate intensified aeolian dust accumulation between 26,000 and 20,000 cal yr BP. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A multiproxy palaeolimnological investigation of Holocene environmental change, between c. 10 700 and 7200 years BP, at Holebudalen, southern Norway	HOLOCENE												Geochemical analyses (x-ray fluorescence, delta C-13 and C/N ratios) were used to reconstruct early Holocene environments (between 10 685 and 7260 cal. yr BP) at a small lake near Holebudalen, southern Norway. Results show a period of increasing stability, with reduced catchment inwash (shown by titanium and potassium minerals), vegetation stabilization and increasing aquatic productivity (C/N ratios). However, periods of instability (loss on ignition (LOI) decrease) are also seen ( most notably at c. 9060 cal. yr BP). Chironomid-inferred July temperature (CI-T) reconstructions show a cooling of c. 2 degrees C (RMSEP = 1.0 degrees C) between c. 8400 and 8000 cal. yr BP and so high-resolution (5 mm; c. 20 yr) diatom analyses were conducted between 8675 and 7830 cal. yr BP in order to further investigate this change. Between c. 8270 and 8000 cal. yr BP there were large reductions (> 50%) in the abundance of tychoplanktonic diatoms (eg, Aulacoseira species) and absolute increases in periphytic diatom communities (eg, Navicula pupula, Pinnularia mesolepta). The multiproxy analyses suggest a period of increased lake ice cover with associated reductions in turbulence during this time. Diatom flora changes are concomitant with a fall in percent LOI and increased catchment erosion at the site and other evidence of regional climatic perturbations in the early Holocene. Therefore, superimposed upon an early Holocene warming trend at Holebudalen, there are climatic perturbations, for example reflected between c. 8200 and 8000 cal. yr BP by diatom communities.					; Birks, H.

The short-wave troughs, which accompany most of the SES events, directly affect the formation and intensity of the bands, especially along their trajectories. In this study, the structure and characteristics of short-wave troughs and long waves during the occurrence of SES bands over the western Black Sea during nine winter periods (2010-2018) were investigated. A total of 48 short-wave troughs and long waves that concurred with snow events were detected in the period. In the classification made according to the movement direction followed by the short-wave troughs, it was determined that the western movement was dominant. This was mostly observed due to the latitudinal movements of the long waves. The average duration of the short-wave troughs over the region was found to be 27.8 h, while the longest duration trough lasted 60 h (LWT-Type). The most obvious effects of long waves were in the form of handling short waves. Apart from these, it also played a critical role in lowering arctic and polar air longitudinally to the south. The short-wave troughs allowed the convection to increase and contributed to the formation of severe SES bands by playing a role in the deepening of the convective boundary layer. The SES bands mostly had more than one parallel band formation in longitudinal direction. Movement directions of short-wave troughs and long waves mostly concurred with the SES bands (77-79%). Therefore, it is possible to talk about the effects of short and long waves not only in the change of boundary layer properties, but also in the direction of the upper atmospheric level (sub-inversion wind directions) movements.

The size spectra of the macroinvertebrate community in ponds with different hydroperiod length were compared along the Tyrrhenian coast of central Italy. Invertebrate sampling was conducted in 21 ponds (8 permanent and 13 temporary) in three different mesohabitats (central sediments. littoral sediments and macrophytes) during spring 2002. Several pond characteristics were also recorded. 2. Density and biomass size spectra were calculated for 123 samples and covered six orders of magnitude in size ranging from 0.126 mu g to 0.5 g. The shape of the density size distribution was unimodal, the mode being around 0.05-0.1 mg, with Oligochaeta and Diptera (Chironomidae) numerically dominant in almost all size classes. 3. The periodic drying affected the total biomass per size class, shown by comparing spectra among mesohabitats and pond types. The higher biomass in all size classes showed by permanent pond and central sediments reflects the major stability of permanent biotopes and, within these, of central sediments. 4. The overall shape of the size spectrum was similar among pond types, mesohabitats and sampling dates. Biomass of larger size classes was linked to variables describing pond stability. 5. We suggest that the biomass size spectrum of benthic macroinvertebrates is a potentially useful tool for quantitative wetland biomonitoring. In small Mediterranean ponds, the regularity of biomass size spectra implies that size-structuring processes are independent of the hydrological stress. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Here we analyze the ostracod assemblages in various surface waters in central-eastern Inner Mongolia, including the abundant ponds formed due to road construction that are otherwise rare on the grassland, as well as natural swamps, lakes, and running waters. A total of 19 species of living ostracods are recovered, with the ponds dominated by Heterocypris incongruens and Ilyocypris mongolica, swamps by Physocypria kraepelini, lakes by Limnocythere inopinata and I. mongolica, and running waters hosting fewer ostracods. Comparative study of the ostracod assemblages from different areas in China and Mongolia reveals intermediate to strong degree of ecological disturbance of the aquatic habitats in central-eastern Inner Mongolia, as denoted by the prevalence of the ecologically tolerant widespread species H. incongruens, L. inopinata, and P. kraepelini. We propose that the ecological disturbance of the aquatic habitats in this area originates from both artificial and natural factors: the flourishment of H. incongruens and P. kraepelini reflect unstable and polluted environments due to human activities including road constructing and livestock raising, while the ubiquity of L. inopinata is due to enriched and fluctuating water chemistry under semi-arid climate. The endemic ostracods in central-eastern Inner Mongolia show sporadic occurrence, and future con-servation of these species should be focused on the sites that possess favourable ecological niches.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				OCT	2022	143								109301	10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109301	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109301		AUG 2022											WOS:000861989000003

The total glacier area has reduced by 3.11 km(2) with a mean front altitude rise of 3.2 m/yr and 4 glaciers have disappeared in Mt. Yulong during 1957 similar to 1999. Mass balance records indicated that glaciers had suffered a constant mass loss of snow and ice during the last several decades, and the accumulated mass balance in Hailuogou basin in Mt. Gongga was - 10.83 m water equivalent in the past 45 years with a annual mean value of -0.24 m, and the value at Baishui glacier No. 1 was -11.38 m water equivalent in the past 52 years with -0.22 m/yr. The inverse variation between mass balance and temperature in China and the Northern Hemisphere reflected that climate warming is mainly corresponding to constant ice and snow mass loss in the past 50 years. The change of the glaciers' surface morphology has occurred since the 1980s, such as enlargement of glacier-lake and ice falls, resulted from the accelrative climate warming.					song, bo/JQJ-0093-2023; Liu, Qiao/H-6525-2011; Zhang, Ningning/I-8627-2014														1674-3822					DEC	2008							59	67																WOS:000422246700006

This compound has the potential to complement other established proxies reflecting riverine terrestrial POC input and allows for a more nuanced assessment of riverine POC export to coastal seas. The current understanding of this proxy is, however, limited. In this study, we compare different indices for riverine sediment input to coastal marine waters (i.e. C-32 1,15-LCD, BIT index and Fe/Ca ratio) in a source-to-sink assessment in the Amazon River drainage system and the northeast South American continental margin, and we test their down-core applicability in a marine gravity core containing late Pleistocene fluvial Amazonian sediments. We show that the relative abundance of the C-32 1,15-LCD is highest in water bodies with low flow velocity and low turbidity such as the downstream portion of lowland tributaries and floodplain lakes. Relative C-32 1,15-LCD abundance is lowest in Andean white water tributaries where autotrophic productivity is hindered by high turbidity and high flow velocity. We also find that suspended particulate matter from all major tributaries during the extreme 2015 dry season has a similar LCD distribution to that of floodplain lakes. This indicates that the chemical composition of the tributaries is less relevant for the LCD distribution than their physical properties such as flow velocity and turbidity. Results from marine surface sediments offshore the Amazon River estuary show significant positive correlations between all three studied proxies. In contrast, we find that the relative C-32 1,15-LCD abundance in the down-core record is anti-correlated to the BIT index and Fe/Ca ratio. While BIT index and Fe/Ca ratio show high (low) values during Heinrich stadials (Dansgaard-Oeschger interstadials), the C-32 1,15-LCD proxy shows the opposite signal. BIT values are also higher during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 2 than during MIS 3, in contrast to trends in the C-32 1,15-LCD proxy. We posit that this pattern arises from a reduction in relative C-32 1,15-LCD abundance and total LCD productivity in the Amazon River during MIS 2 when less-humid conditions and lower sea level led to reduced area of floodplains. During Heinrich stadials, Andean sediment input increased and led to higher turbidity that resulted in lower C-32 1,15-LCD production. Our study shows that major changes in water discharge, sediment transport and river morphology can lead to discrepancies between the BIT index and the relative abundance of the C-32 1,15-LCD. Thus, we suggest that Amazonian aquatic and terrestrial POC pools had contrasting responses to changes related to both climate (e.g. increased Andean precipitation) and river morphology (e.g. steeper along-channel slope due to falling and low stand sea level).

J	Yang, Y; Yoshimura, K				Yang, Yan; Yoshimura, Kei			Simulation of Water Isotopes in Combustion-Derived Vapor Emissions in Winter	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												With urbanization, anthropogenic water vapor emissions have become a significant component of the urban atmosphere. Fossil fuel combustion-derived vapor (CDV) is a primary source of these emissions. Owing to the notably low CDV d-excess, stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes are promising for distinguishing CDV from natural sources. Considering the limitations of in situ observations, this study aims to explore the feasibility of using IsoRSM, an isotopically enabled regional atmospheric model, to simulate CDV emissions in urban areas in winter. Two experiments were conducted: one in Salt Lake City (SLC) in January 2017 and another in Beijing in January 2007. The simulation results showed that the CDV addition significantly reduced the water vapor d-excess, particularly when the boundary layer was stable. The simulation with CDV emissions aligned better with the time series of in situ observations in SLC. The modification led to a more pronounced positive correlation between vapor d-excess and specific humidity, which was similar to the observation of SLC. The CDV inclusion significantly increased the vapor d-excess variability with varying wind directions in both sites. However, in Beijing, the underestimation of d-excess variation from natural sources caused a bigger discrepancy between the observed and simulated d-excess and CDV fraction. Thus, though there were still biases, the inclusion of CDV could improve the accuracy of isotopic simulation in the urban regions where CDV was one of the controlling factors of vapor d-excess. Combustion-derived vapor (CDV) generated from fossil fuel is one of the main sources of anthropogenic water emissions in urban areas. Water d-excess, which is calculated with the water isotopes of oxygen (delta 18O) and hydrogen (delta 2H), is usually used to distinguish the water from different sources. Due to the extremely low d-excess of CDV, we can use the water isotopes to partition CDV from naturally evaporative water. Different from previous researches on CDV based on the in situ observed data, this study aims to simulate the isotopic composition of CDV in urban areas with the atmospheric model. The results of experiments in Salt Lake City and Beijing indicates that CDV can be one of the controlling factors of the vapor d-excess in some urban regions, and the inclusion of CDV in the model will improve the accuracy of simulation in these regions. Therefore, this approach has great potential for research of water isotopes on a global scale with the impact of anthropogenic emissions. The emission of combustion-derived vapor (CDV) was simulated with the isotopic-enable regional spectral model The CDV addition reduced the water vapor d-excess and made the simulation align better with the observations in Salt Lake City The CDV inclusion significantly increased the vapor d-excess variability with varying wind directions					; Yoshimura, Kei/F-2041-2010	Yang, Yan/0009-0000-4568-8791; 													2169-897X	2169-8996				AUG 16	2024	129	15							e2023JD040543	10.1029/2023JD040543	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023JD040543													WOS:001284381000001

Low prevalence of VHSV detected in round goby collected in offshore regions of Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Since the first reports of mortalities due to viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) type IVb in the Laurentian Great Lakes basin during 2005 (Lake St. Clair, USA and Bay of Quinte, Lake Ontario, Canada), many groups have conducted surveillance efforts for the virus, primarily in nearshore areas. The round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) has been identified as a key species to target for surveillance, because they have a very high probability of infection at a given site. Our objective in this study was to document and quantify VHSV in round gobies in offshore waters of Lake Ontario using molecular techniques. We collected 139 round gobies from depths ranging from 55 to 150 m using bottom trawls during the early spring of 2011 and detected VHSV in 4 individuals (1/26 fish at 95 m, 2/12 fish at 105 m, and 1/24 fish at 135 m). These results expand the known depth range of VHSV in the Great Lakes. They also have implications on the management of the spread of VHSV within infected bodies of water related to the mixing of populations of fish that would remain distinct in their breeding habitats, but then have the opportunity to mix in their overwintering habitats, as well as to increase overlap of predator and prey species in overwintering habitats.

J	MURRAY, MW; ANDREN, AW				MURRAY, MW; ANDREN, AW			PRECIPITATION SCAVENGING OF POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYL CONGENERS IN THE GREAT-LAKES REGION	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT PART A-GENERAL TOPICS												Ten precipitation events were sampled in the fall of 1986 in Madison, WI and analyzed for individual congener and total polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) levels in both the dissolved and particulate phases. Total PCB concentrations were generally at the lower end of ranges recently reported for precipitation. Operationally defined dissolved and particulate phase congener distribution patterns for the two events of highest concentration were qualitatively similar to gas-phase and particle-bound patterns for northern Wisconsin air samples. Higher than predicted dissolved-phase concentrations may indicate non-equilibrium processes during scavenging and/or sample processing, the presence of colloids and micro-particules, and/or more efficient gas-phase transfer to hydrometeors with organic coatings. Observed organic carbon-normalized distribution coefficients increased slightly with increasing octanol-water partition coefficients, giving the relationship log K(oc) = 0.22 log K(ow) + 4.64. The data indicate that a third organic-rich colloidal phase could be influencing partitioning, and could explain the higher than expected apparent gas scavenging efficiency for PCBs from the atmosphere. Precipitation-weighted mean fluxes of PCBs in the dissolved and particulate phases were 1.2 and 1.4-mu-g m-2 year-1, respectively, indicating that precipitation remains a significant source of PCBs to the upper Great Lakes.																			0004-6981					APR	1992	26	5					883	897		10.1016/0960-1686(92)90247-I	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0960-1686(92)90247-I													WOS:A1992HD72500015

Val			Vertical and horizontal particle transport in the coastal waters of a large lake: An assessment by sediment trap and thorium-234 measurements	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												The horizontal and vertical flux of particulate material in the nearshore of southern Lake Michigan (0-40 m) was estimated with the naturally occurring radionuclide Th-234. Horizontal fluxes of Th-234 supplemented apparent vertical fluxes of Th-234 in the water column (based on local Th-234/U-238 disequilibria) by a factor of 7-14, reinforcing the importance of lateral transport in coastal environments. Calculated onshore transport of particulate material across the 40 m isobath was as high as 1.1 x 10(6) kg km(-1) d(-1), and exceeds estimates of terrigenous (riverine and bluff erosion) loading. Estimates of onshore flux of organic carbon exceeded areal primary productivity by as much as approximate to 300%, and should be considered in nearshore carbon budgets. Bottom-tethered sediment traps (placed 5 m above the bottom) measured sedimentation rates that were approximate to 1 order of magnitude lower than Th-234 derived mass fluxes from the water column and approximate to 2 orders of magnitude lower than Th-234 derived mass fluxes to the lakebed. We ascribe this difference to under collecting by the sediment trap either because of trap hydrodynamics or flux occurring below the trap capture plane. Cross-shore fluxes showed a periodicity of approximate to 4 days and correlated strongly with a topographic vorticity wave that is present throughout the year in southern Lake Michigan. The impact of this wave (as a driver of bidirectional cross-shore flux) on biogeochemical cycling and both nearshore and offshore food webs has not yet been explicitly considered.

Incubation success and habitat selection of shore-spawning kokanee Oncorhynchus nerka: effects of water-level regulation and habitat characteristics	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Changes to water-level regimes have been known to restructure fish assemblages and interfere with the population dynamics of both littoral and pelagic species. The effect of altered water-level regimes on shore-spawning kokanee Oncorhynchus nerka incubation success was evaluated using a comprehensive in situ study in Lake Pend Oreille, ID, USA. Survival was not related to substrate size composition or depth, indicating that shore-spawning kokanee do not currently receive a substrate-mediated survival benefit from higher winter water levels. Substrate composition also did not differ among isobaths in the nearshore area. On average, the odds of an egg surviving to the preemergent stage were more than three times greater for sites in downwelling areas than those lacking downwelling. This study revealed that shoreline spawning habitat is not as limited as previously thought. Downwelling areas appear to contribute substantially to shore-spawning kokanee recruitment. This research illustrates the value of rigorous in situ studies both for testing potential mechanisms underlying population trends and providing insight into spawning habitat selection.																			0906-6691	1600-0633				JUL	2015	24	3					412	423		10.1111/eff.12156	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12156													WOS:000356455900007

To reduce this land-use conflict and to promote the current level of biodiversity of colonial nesters in the area, artificial islands were built in the winter of 1995-1996 with different areas designated for a variety of nesting waterbirds including Caspian terns. In 1994, prior to island construction. we tested three substrate types for tern nesting preferences so that an appropriate substrate could be placed on the Caspian tern designated portion of the new islands. We found a preference for sand over pea-gravel and crushed stone. and indirect evidence for a preference favouring the experimental substrates over the pre-existing substrate of hard-packed ground. Based on these results, the small area of the island designed for Caspian tern nesting was surfaced with sand and was subsequently colonised successfully. The colony established and reproduced successfully on the designated site in 1996 and grew in numbers of nesting pairs in 1997. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Benthic secondary production in eight oligotrophic arctic Alaskan lakes	JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY												Across aquatic ecosystems, benthic secondary production generally is thought to be limited by autochthonous primary production. We estimated secondary production in 8 oligotrophic arctic lakes of varying morphometric characteristics for which we also had estimates of pelagic and benthic primary production during the summer of 2001. Four of the lakes supported similar communities of fish, and 4 were fishless. The size-frequency method was used to calculate cohort production interval (CPI)-corrected lake benthic secondary production and production to biomass (P:B) ratios for all taxa in all lakes. Taxa examined from sediment samples included Baetis spp., Grensia praeterita, and larval chironomids. Larval chironomids had the greatest secondary production overall. Whole-lake benthic secondary production ranged from 1.02 to 20.52 g dry mass m(-2) y(-1). No significant relationship or trend was found between benthic secondary production and primary production (whole-lake, benthic, or pelagic). A stronger trend (p = 0.2) suggested higher benthic secondary production in fishless lakes than in lakes with fish, but within fishless lakes, no pattern was found that suggested autochthonous control of benthic secondary production. Our study is unique in that we examined multiple oligotrophic lakes and demonstrated that the secondary production of benthic fauna was, at most, weakly related to autochthonous primary production. This result is in contrast to the commonly accepted paradigm that autochthonous production limits secondary production. We suggest that allochthonous organic matter sources were very important for supporting secondary production in these oligotrophic arctic lakes.					; Sokol, Eric/HZL-4014-2023	Sokol, Eric/0000-0001-5923-0917; Northington, Robert/0000-0002-1347-0971; 													0887-3593					JUN	2010	29	2					465	479		10.1899/09-026.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1899/09-026.1													WOS:000277472300007

All tuffs are calc-akaline rhyolites, consistent with their setting in the Central Andean Volcanic Zone. Five of the older tuffs were 40Ar/39Ar dated and yield an age range of 6.63-0.75 Ma. Organic material associated with tuffs deposited into paleolake sediments, paleowetland deposits, or urine-encrusted rodent middens provide constraints on the age of several Late Pleistocene and Holocene tuffs. These tuffs provide key stratigraphic markers and ages for lake cycles and archeological sites on the Bolivian Altiplano and for assessing rates of surficial processes and archeology in both the Atacama and Altiplano. While modern climate, and consequently questions about geomorphic processes and climate change, differs in the hyperarid Atacama and the semi-arid Altiplano, the most extensive air-fall tuffs covered both regions, placing the Atacama and the Bolivian Altiplano in the same tephrostratigraphic province. For example, the Escara B tuff (similar to 1.85 Ma), can be securely identified in both the Altiplano and Atacama. On the Altiplano, dates from the Escara B and E tuffs securely establish the age of the Escara Formation-representing the oldest expansive lake documented on the Bolivian Altiplano. By contrast, the presence of the Escara B tuff below similar to 6 m of alluvial sediment at the Blanco Encalado site in the Atacama desert yields information about sedimentation rates in this hyperarid region. Indeed, most tuffs from the Atacama Desert are older than 600,000 years, even though they occur within fluvial terraces immediately adjacent to the alluvial fans that are still active. Most of these geomorphic surfaces in the Atacama also possess well-developed saline soils that, when combined with the radionnetric ages of the distal tuffs, suggest slow rates of geomorphic change and exceptional landscape stability for this area during the Quaternary.

J	SCOTT, NJ; REYNOLDS, RP				SCOTT, NJ; REYNOLDS, RP			PHENOTYPIC VARIATION OF THE MEXICAN DUCK (ANAS-PLATYRHYNCHOS-DIAZI) IN MEXICO	CONDOR												A collection of 98 breeding Mexican Ducks (A. p. diazi) was made in Mexico from 6 areas between the USA border with Chihuahua and Lake Chapala, Jalisco, to study geographic variation. Plumage indices showed a relatively smooth clinal change from north to south. Northern populations were most influenced by the northern mallard (A. p. platyrhynchos) phenotype. Most samples were fairly uniform; that from the Rio Conchos area in northeastern Chihuahua was noticeably more variable than the others. Soft part coloration is described. Weights varied from 849-1243 g in males and from 647-1264 g in females. Measurements of total, wing and culmen lengths and bill width were usually significantly larger in males at any one site, but showed no regular geographic trends. Hybridization between A. p. platyrhynchos and A. p. diazi phenotypes may or may not be increasing in the middle Rio Grande and Rio Conchos valleys; available data are insufficient to decide. Introgression of the northern mallard genome into Mexican A. p. diazi populations may be largely historical owing to recent reductions in the number of migratory mallards reaching Mexico. A spring 1978 aerial census yielded an estimate of 55,500 A. p. diazi-like birds in Mexico. Populations of A. p. diazi appear to be as large as the available habitat allows. Management should be directed towards increasing and stabilizing the nesting habitat. The stability of the zone of intergradation should be investigated.																				1938-5129					1984	86	3					266	274		10.2307/1366994	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1366994													WOS:A1984TH65900006

Fish Assemblages and Environmental Variables Associated with Gobiids in Nearshore Areas of the Lower Great Lakes	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We investigated which fish species and environmental variables were associated with the invasive round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) and tubenose goby (Proterorhinus marmoratus) in nearshore Canadian waters of the Huron-Erie corridor of the lower Great Lakes. We measured a suite of environmental variables and used triplicate beach seine samples to collect fishes in summer 2006. Thirty sites were sampled in the day and a subset (n = 14) at night. Of 1,955 individuals caught in daytime samples, round goby (21.0 %), spottail shiner (17.3%) and emerald shiner (14.2%) were most abundant. Of 1,521 individuals collected at night, the most abundant species were round goby (42.3%) and emerald shiner (24.1 %). Tubenose gobies represented 1 % and 1.7% of all individuals caught in the day and night, respectively. Rarefaction analysis showed that overall species richness was greater in the day than night. Significantly more emerald shiner (P = 0.017), rock bass (P = 0.046) and round goby (P = 0.035) were caught at night than in the day; more logperch were caught in the day than at night (P = 0.042). Round gobies were positively associated with water temperatures up to 24 degrees, but there was no relationship between round goby abundance and warmer temperatures. There were too few tubenose goby captured to determine their statistical association with environmental factors; however, tubenose gobies were found only where round gobies were collected. Round goby and tubenose goby were associated with yellow perch and rock bass. The benthic round goby was the most abundant species, whereas other abundant species were pelagic, schooling fishes that occupied a habitat distinct from round goby.																			0380-1330					SEP	2008	34	3					450	460		10.3394/0380-1330(2008)34[450:FAAEVA]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3394/0380-1330(2008)34[450:FAAEVA]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000259885100006
J	Yoo, JS				Yoo, Jong Su			Productivity and abundance of bacteria and phytoplankton in Incheon Dock, western coast of Korea	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												The monthly variations of abundance and productivity of bacteria and phytoplankton were investigated in 2002 at Incheon Dock in Korea, almost closed marine ecosystem. Incheon Dock has unique marine environment with scarcely a current and waves such as in a lake. The bacterial abundance was 0.4-6.3 x 10(6) cells.ml(-1), while the bacterial productivity showed in the range of 0.7-26.3 mgC m(-1) hr(-1). The phytoplankton chlorophyll-a concentrations fell between 2.1 and 18.1 mu g.l(-1), where nanoplankton fractions contributed in 32.5-96.78% (average: 73.2%). The algal bloom occurred in March and August, and primary productivity measured by using C-14 method, showed a fluctuation ranging from 49.4 to 4,359.4 mgC m(-2) day(-1). The primary productivity of nanotoplankton accounted for 79% of total phytoplankton. Meanwhile, the ratio of bacterial productivity over primary productivity was between 2.0 and 7.7. This study showed that the abundance and productivity of bacteria and phytoplankton were higher at Incheon Dock than those at other coastal areas in Korea. Especially the assimilation number was higher at Incheon Dock than that at lake Shihwa which is a severely eutrophicated area. This result indicates that Incheon Dock has unique ecosystem oceanographically and topographically, and it differs from other coastal areas in terms of the low trophic level organisms being abundant and highly productive.																			0254-8704					JUL	2008	29	4					531	534											19195392					WOS:000258483100022

Depositional conditions, microbial communities and mineralogical compositions vary significantly as no two settings are identical. The common thread linking all of the settings is that evaporation exceeds precipitation, resulting in elevated concentrations of cations and anions that are higher than in oceanic systems. The Dead Sea and Storrs Lake are terrestrial examples of two diverse-modern evaporitic settings, as the former is below sea level and the latter is a coastal lake on an island in the Caribbean. Each system varies in water chemistry; the Dead Sea-dissolved ions originate from surface weathered materials, springs, and aquifers while the dissolved ion concentration in Storrs Lake is primarily derived from sea water. Consequently, some of the ions, e.g., Sr, Ba are found at significantly lower concentrations in Storrs Lake than in the Dead Sea. The origin of the dissolved ions are ultimately responsible for the pH of each system, the alkaline versus mildly the acidic. Each system exhibits unique biogeochemical properties as the extreme environments select certain microorganisms. Storrs Lake possesses significant biofilms and stromatolitic deposits; the alkalinity varies, depending on rainfall and storm, activity. The microbial Community in Storrs Lake is much more diverse and active than those observed in the Dead Sea. The Dead Sea waters are mildly acidic, lack stromatolites, and possess a lower density of microbial populations. The general absence of microbial and biofilm fossilization is due to the depletion of HCO3 and its slightly acidic pH.																			1876-1682		978-1-4020-8305-1				2008	4						197	+																WOS:000262046300007

The moss, predominantly Aplodon worm-skioldii (Hornem.) R.Br., began to accumulate approximately 6500 years ago and persisted for about 2000 years. Siliceous microfossils were generally well preserved in the peat, although taxon richness was low (i.e., only 19 diatom taxa, 16 chrysophyte cyst morphotypes, and 4 testate amoebae general. Despite the paucity of taxa, marked shifts in species composition were recorded. Geochemical analyses and biogenic silica determination on the peat did not show any significant trends. To our knowledge, this study represents the first such combined analysis of a High Arctic peat, so our interpretations should be considered tentative. Environmental variables were not stable during the 2000 years of peat accumulation, as suggested by microfossil assemblage changes. For example, about 5000 years BP, diatoms reached their maximum relative abundance with taxa indicative of wetter habitats. We hypothesize that an influx of meltwater to the peat may have occurred at this time, perhaps because of wetter conditions or larger accumulations of snow during winter. These preliminary data indicate that siliceous microfossil analyses from arctic peat cores may eventually fine-tune paleoecological inferences for this climatically important region, once the environmental variables determining species distributions in peat deposits are determined.

Transport of desert dust mixed with North African industrial pollutants in the subtropical Saharan Air Layer	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												An analysis of chemical composition data of particulate matter samples (TSP, PM10 and PM2.5) collected from 2002 to 2008 in the North Atlantic free troposphere at the Izana Global Atmospheric Watch (GAW) observatory (Tenerife, Canary Islands) shows that desert dust is very frequently mixed with particulate pollutants in the Saharan Air Layer (SAL). The study of this data set with Median Concentrations At Receptor (MCAR) plots allowed the identification of the potential source regions of the dust and particulate pollutants. Areas located at the south of the southern slope of the Atlas mountains emerge as the most frequent source of the soil desert dust advected to the northern edge of the SAL in summer. Industrial emissions occurring in Northern Algeria, Eastern Algeria, Tunisia and the Atlantic coast of Morocco appear as the most important source of the nitrate, ammonium and a fraction of sulphate (at least 60% of the sulphate <10 mu m transported from some regions) observed in the SAL. These emissions are mostly linked to crude oil refineries, phosphate-based fertilizer industry and power plants. Although desert dust emissions appear as the most frequent source of the phosphorous observed in the SAL, high P concentrations are observed when the SAL is affected by emissions from open mines of phosphate and phosphate based fertilizer industry. The results also show that a significant fraction of the sulphate (up to 90% of sulphate <10 mu m transported from some regions) observed in the SAL may be influenced by soil emissions of evaporite minerals in well defined regions where dry saline lakes (chotts) are present. These interpretations of the MCAR plots are consistent with the results obtained with the Positive Matrix Factorization PMF2) receptor modelling. The results of this study show that North African industrial pollutants may be mixed with desert dust and exported to the North Atlantic in the Saharan Air Layer.

Larval gizzard shad (< 30 mm total length, TL) were most likely to be affected by alewives through trophic competition and predation. However, gizzard shad larvae were concentrated in uplake, littoral areas when alewives of all ages were downlake and pelagic. Gizzard shad spawning was virtually completed in June but most alewife spawning occurred in July. Gizzard shad larvae grew faster (1.33 mm/d) than alewife larvae (0.84 mm/d) throughout the summer. Alewife larvae 5-30 mm TL exhibited lower mortality (mean, 11.0%/d) than gizzard shad larvae (means: 40.1%/d and 12.9%/d for length-groups of 7.0-12.0 and 12.5-30.0 mm TL, respectively). Earlier spawning and faster growth of gizzard shad provided a high degree of temporal isolation, limiting both interference and exploitative competition with alewife larvae. We concluded that alewives and gizzard shad are compatible in Smith Mountain Lake and will likely be so in other systems of similar morphometry and water quality. However, potential negative impacts on other fish dictate that the alewife should be considered with extreme caution as a forage-species candidate.																			0002-8487					MAR	1991	120	2					157	165		10.1577/1548-8659(1991)120<0157:COAAGS>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1991)120<0157:COAAGS>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1991FR51600003
J	Botts, PS; Patterson, BA; Schloesser, DW				Botts, PS; Patterson, BA; Schloesser, DW			Zebra mussel effects on benthic invertebrates: Physical or biotic?	JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY												In soft sediments, Dreissena spp. create firm substrate in the form of aggregates of living mussels (druses) that roll free on the sediments. Druses provide physical structure which increases habitat heterogeneity, and the mussels increase benthic organic matter through the production of pseudofeces and feces. Descriptive and experimental studies were used to determine: 1) whether the density of benthic invertebrates in soft sediments increased in the presence of druses, and 2) whether the invertebrate assemblage responded to the physical structure provided by a druse or to some biotic effect associated with the presence of living mussels. In core samples collected biweekly during summer in Presque Isle Bay, Erie, Pennsylvania, amphipods, chironomids, oligochaetes, turbellarians, and hydrozoans were significantly more abundant in sand with druses than in bare sand. When mesh bags containing either a living druse, non-living druse, or no druse were incubated in the bay for 33 d, we found that chironomids were significantly more abundant in treatments with living druses than with non-living druses, and in treatments with non-living druses than with no druse; turbellarians, amphipods, and hydrozoans were significantly more abundant in treatments with living or non-living druses than with no druse; oligochaetes showed no significant differences among treatments. This study demonstrates that most taxa of benthic invertebrates in soft substrate respond specifically to the physical structure associated with aggregates of mussel shells, but further study is needed to examine chironomid responses to some biotic effect dependent on the presence of living mussels.																			0887-3593					JUN	1996	15	2					179	184		10.2307/1467947	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1467947													WOS:A1996UQ68500004

According to the trophic conditions reservoirs varied between oligo-and eutrophic status. Chlorophylla concentration, measured for the estimation of primary production, was determined considerably high along the investigation period. A total of 62 zooplankton species were identified with the contribution of 44 rotifers, nine cladocerans and nine copepods. Except one reservoir, all of the others were dominated by rotifera group, and also in each study site dominant taxa were changed at species level. On the other hand common dominant taxa for all reservoirs was the rotifer Polyarthra vulgaris Carlin, 1943 with 95 % frequency. In terms of zooplankton species, most of the studied reservoirs showed less than 50% similarities, due to their different limnological conditions and different geographic locations. Reservoirs in high trophic conditions in the present study were represented by low species diversity. Water quality in the reservoirs with respect to biological data were determined as beta-mesosaprobic. The using limnological and biological indices to determine water quality were consistent. Densities of main zooplankton groups, and also frequent species of the reservoirs correlated with epilimnion layer depths and total phoshorus concentrations significantly. On the other hand rotifera variation was affected mainly by physical variables (pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, conductivity), and crustacean variations were related with total phoshorus. The comperative assessment between limnological variables and zooplankton community in this reservoirs was studied for the first time.					, reyhan/AAB-8612-2020; Gaygusuz, Özcan/AAB-9578-2020; köker, latife/AAB-7634-2020; Dorak, Zeynep/AAD-4903-2020; , merbay/AAB-9694-2020; Gürevin, Cenk/AAB-8531-2020	Koker, Latife/0000-0002-9134-2801; Gurevin, Cenk/0000-0002-5354-949X														2602-473X					2019	34	1					29	38		10.26650/ASE2019522326	http://dx.doi.org/10.26650/ASE2019522326													WOS:000468909600005
J	Dilly, O; Irmler, U				Dilly, O; Irmler, U			Succession in the food web during the decomposition of leaf litter in a black alder (Alnus glutinosa (Gaertn.) L.) forest	PEDOBIOLOGIA												The functional structure within the biota was studied during; the decomposition of leaf litter in a black alder forest in northern Germany. The succession of the food web was analysed at a 'dry' site and a 'wet' site close to a lake with eight? four, and seven functional groups of bacteria, fungi, and fauna. The decomposition process was divided into two phases separated by the summer dryness. During the first phase cellulolytic bacteria, omnipotent and minor potent fungi were present together with mycetophagous, saprophagous and humiphagous soil animals. Derived from trophic relationships between functional groups, a food path was suggested for the first phase from litter via cellulolytic bacteria to microphagous and saprophagous soil fauna and their predators. In addition, food paths led fr om litter via different fungal groups to mycetophagous soil fauna and their predators. During the second decomposition phase the number of food paths was reduced. Only fungi without lignolytic potential persisted and saprophagous animals predominated. A retarded occurrence of nitrifying bacteria was observed which suggests increasing ammonium and nitrite concentration during decomposition. High correlation was found between generalistic bacteria and ploteolytic bacteria referring to an internal protein flux within these functional groups. The number of trophic links was higher during the first phase. The course of succession is similar at the two sites.																			0031-4056	1873-1511				APR	1998	42	2					109	123																WOS:000073595800003

Eutrophication Problem in Egypt	EUTROPHICATION: CAUSES, CONSEQUENCES AND CONTROL												The coastal area of Egypt on the Mediterranean Sea extends for about 1,200 km. It hosts a number of important residential and economic centres, like the cities of Alexandria, Port Said, Damietta, Rosetta, Matruh, and AL-Arish. The coastal strip between Alexandria and Matruh hosts tens of tourist villages, which are usually crowded by visitors during summer. Many activities are known in the coastal area, including fishing, industrial, tourism, trading and agricultural, oil and gas production, and transportation. There are five large ecologically different coastal lagoons connected to the sea coast, representing together about 25% of the total area of the Mediterranean wetland. These lagoons are considered as reservoirs for agricultural, industrial, and municipal wastes, which are discharged from surrounding cities and cultivated lands. The Egyptian Mediterranean coast receives huge volumes of wastewaters every year through the coastal lagoons and from other land-based effluents. These wastes are loaded by variable amounts and types of pollutants, in addition to great amount of nitrogenous and phosphorous compounds, which in turn cause high level of eutrophication along a significant part of the Mediterranean coast, particularly of both the Nile Delta region and Alexandria coast. Eutrophication is an importunate problem to the Egyptian Mediterranean coast, resulting in fundamental changes in the structure of the planktonic and benthic communities as well as fish mortality. Eutrophication was accompanied by the appearance of several harmful algal species at several hot spots along the coast. The level of eutrophication demonstrated wide variation along the Egyptian coast relative to the variations in the volume and contents of discharged wastes.

A better understanding of past periods indicative of permafrost degradation and aggradation is important for predicting the future response of Arctic landscapes to climate change. Here, we used a multi-proxy approach to analyse a4m long sediment core from a drained thermokarst lake basin on the northern Seward Peninsula in western Arctic Alaska (USA). Sedimentological, biogeochemical, geochronological, micropalaeontological (ostracoda, testate amoebae) and tephra analyses were used to determine the long-term environmental Early-Wisconsin to Holocene history preserved in our core for central Beringia. Yedoma accumulation dominated throughout the Early to Late-Wisconsin but was interrupted by wetland formation from 44.5 to 41.5ka BP. The latter was terminated by the deposition of 1m of volcanic tephra, most likely originating from the South Killeak Maar eruption at about 42ka BP. Yedoma deposition continued until 22.5ka BP and was followed by a depositional hiatus in the sediment core between 22.5 and 0.23ka BP. We interpret this hiatus as due to intense thermokarst activity in the areas surrounding the site, which served as a sediment source during the Late-Wisconsin to Holocene climate transition. The lake forming the modern basin on the upland initiated around 0.23ka BP and drained catastrophically in spring 2005. The present study emphasises that Arctic lake systems and periglacial landscapes are highly dynamic and that permafrost formation as well as degradation in central Beringia was controlled by regional to global climate patterns as well as by local disturbances.

The presence of Eustrongylides in fish is a public health concern, and effective risk management procedures are necessary to guarantee that infected products do not reach the market. Currently, in the European Union, there is no official sampling plan for fresh fish that defines sample size, inspection methods, and criteria for accepting or rejecting the product. An approach to Eustrongylides risk management is proposed in this study. A total of 270 batches of A. boyeri, each consisting of 29 specimens, were collected and examined visually in 3 years (2020-2023). The prevalence of the parasite was 20% in 2020, and in the first months of 2021, it grew up to similar to 40%, then dropped to 12.50% in December 2021 and settled at 16% in February 2022. In January and February 2023, the prevalence fell below 1%. The mean abundance was calculated and used to establish a threshold value to determine fish marketability. In 2020 and 2021, several batches were judged not marketable, and in some batches, a freezing treatment was implemented to ensure the inactivation of the parasite. In the last months of 2022 and in January and February of 2023, the presence of parasites in captured fish was negligible, and this allowed the marketability of fish as fresh. The proposed sampling plan was effective in preventing the commercialization of potentially hazardous products.

Morphometry of Great Basin pluvial shore landforms: Implications for paleolake basins on Mars	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS												Many basins with relict contributing valley networks and outlet valleys in the Martian highlands indicate past flowing and ponded water on the surface. These likely paleolakes motivate an investigation of pluvial shore landforms in the Great Basin region of the western United States, as confident identification of strandlines on Mars would facilitate analyses of its past hydrology and climate. The purpose of this study is to characterize the scale of Late Pleistocene erosional and depositional shore landforms in an endorheic setting, determine the preservation potential of similar forms from multiple epochs in early Martian history, and identify the data products that would be necessary to detect them. We use Differential Global Positioning System field surveys to measure the dimensions and elevations of shore landforms; compare shore platform widths to theoretical maxima; and note the minimum scale of landforms that have survived since the Late Noachian and Early Hesperian Epochs on Mars. We find that due to impact gardening and aeolian erosion, Martian highland paleolakes like those in the pluvial Great Basin would likely not have well-preserved shore landforms, unless they were unusually large and formed in the Late Hesperian or later. Individual strandlines are often not equally well expressed around an entire basin, so correlating shore landforms in plan view imaging and using their consistency in elevation as a hypothesis test for paleolakes can be challenging. Detection of younger shore landforms like those examined here would require meter-resolution imaging and topography such as stereo digital elevation models.																			2169-9097	2169-9100				JUL 18	2012	117								E07004	10.1029/2012JE004046	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2012JE004046													WOS:000306700500001

Isotopic values of the Amazon headwaters in Peru: comparison of the wet upper Rio Madre de Dios watershed with the dry Urubamba-Apurimac river system	RAPID COMMUNICATIONS IN MASS SPECTROMETRY												RATIONALE: The Amazon River is a huge network of long tributaries, and little is known about the headwaters. Here we present a study of one wet tropical Amazon forest side, and one dry and cold Atiplano plateau, originating from the same cordillera. The aim is to see how this difference affects the water characteristics. METHODS: Different kind of water (spring, lake, river, rainfall) were sampled to determine their stable isotopes ratios (oxygen 18/16 and hydrogen 2/1) by continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS). These ratios coupled with chemical analysis enabled us to determine the origin of the water, the evaporation process and the water recycling over the Amazon plain forest and montane cloud forest. RESULTS: Our study shows that the water flowing in the upper Madre de Dios basin comes mainly from the foothill humid forest, with a characteristic water recycling process signature, and not from higher glacier melt. On the contrary, the water flowing in the Altiplano Rivers is mainly from glacier melts, with a high evaporation process. This snow and glacier are fed mainly by Atlantic moisture which transits over the large Amazon forest. CONCLUSIONS: The Atlantic moisture and its recycling over this huge tropical forest display a progressive isotopic gradient, as a function of distance from the ocean. At the level of the montane cloud forest and on the altiplano, respectively, additional water recycling and evaporation occur, but they are insignificant in the total water discharge.

J	Peros, MC; Gajewski, K				Peros, Matthew C.; Gajewski, Konrad			Pollen-based reconstructions of late Holocene climate from the central and western Canadian Arctic	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Two lake-sediment cores from the western and central Canadian Arctic were used to investigate late Holocene climate variability in the region. Both cores were analyzed for pollen, organic matter, biogenic silica, and magnetic susceptibility, and were dated using a combination of Pb-210 and C-14 techniques. Core MB01, from southwestern Victoria Island, provides a 2600-year-long record. Fossil pollen percentages, along with other parameters, suggest the occurrence of a cold period around 2400 cal year BP (450 BC), followed by slightly warmer conditions by 1800 cal year BP (150 AD), and a return to cooler conditions throughout much of the last millennium. Core SL06, from southern Boothia Peninsula, shows more subtle changes in pollen percentages over its 2500-year duration, but an increase in Cyperaceae and decrease in Oxyria pollen around 1400 cal year BP (550 AD) are indicative of warmer conditions at that time. Quantitative climate reconstructions from these pollen sequences were compared to two other pollen-based climate records from the region and indicate the presence of a widespread wet period similar to 500 cal year BP (450 AD), and a cool and dry Little Ice Age. In the reconstructions based on pollen percentage data, the twentieth century summer temperature and annual precipitation in the central and western Canadian Arctic were comparable to that which occurred over the last 2500 years. However, pollen-influx values increase in the most recent sediments, suggesting high plant productivity during the late twentieth century.

We designed and applied an oligonucleotide probe-targeted to the 16S rRNA sequence of strain Y2 of a microcystin-degrading bacterium (MCD-bacterium), which was isolated from Lake Suwa, Japan. In both the 1998 and 1999 tests, FISH clearly showed that MCD-bacteria existed in the mucilage and that, when a high concentration of cell-bound microcystin was detected, MCD-bacteria exceeded 10% of the sum of bacteria hybridized with group-specific probes. The concentration of MCD-bacteria was highest in summer 1998, when a toxic species, M. viridis, was dominant. There was a high correlation between the number of MCD-bacteria in the mucilage and the concentration of cell-bound microcystin in the lake. Our results suggest that MCD-bacteria responded to changes in the concentration of microcystin and degraded the microcystin when it was released from Microcystis cells. We also analyzed changes in the bacterial community structure associated with the Microcystis colonies by using domain- and group-specific oligonucleotide probes. Changes in the concentrations of the Cytophaga/Flavobacterium group and 6-Proteobacteria, which can degrade macromolecules derived from Microcystis cells, were synchronized with changes in the concentration of Microcystis. The results not only suggest the significant role of MCD-bacteria in detoxification, but also demonstrate a possible sequence of degradation from Microcystis cells to microcystin maintained in the cell, which is then carried out by bacterial consortia in the mucilage.

Long-Term Standardized Sampling as a Tool for Evaluating Management Actions: BACI Analysis to Reevaluate Predatory Control of Stunted Crappie with Saugeye	FISHERIES												Field evaluations of management manipulations are rarely conducted, in part because they are difficult to design and require large sampling effort. However, many commonly used management approaches have <50% success rate, indicating the need for more research. Herein, we provide a case study illustrating how historic standard sampling data from Oklahoma were used to design robust before-after control-impact study designs to evaluate the effectiveness of stocking saugeye Sander vitreus x S. canadensis as a predatory control for stunted White Crappie Pomoxis annularis populations. Comparing six manipulated lakes with six reference lakes (no saugeye stockings), we found that proportional size distribution, proportional size distribution of preferred-size fish, and mean length at ages 1 and 2 of White Crappie all improved after stockings, but still fell short of statewide median values. Further, similar improvements in these metrics also occurred in reference lakes, suggesting they were likely caused by regional patterns (flood/drought or temperature effects) rather than management intervention. Thus, we conclude saugeye stockings are not likely to routinely improve stunted White Crappie fisheries. We encourage managers who have historic data to use these data to robustly evaluate management interventions (as illustrated in this study), because our field needs additional information regarding when management interventions will be most effective, versus when they may not have the desired outcome. These historic data sets have considerable utility in providing this type of information. Our case study illustrates the importance of replication and reference lakes to avoid erroneous conclusions in such evaluations.

Assessing occupancy of freshwater fishes in urban boat slips of Toronto Harbour	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Hardening of natural shorelines in urban aquatic ecosystems can result in a loss of fish habitat and productivity. The north shore of Toronto Harbour (Lake Ontario) has been converted to hardened boat slips for commercial, industrial and recreational purposes, but its potential utility as fish habitat has not been evaluated. The objective of this study was to determine whether fish frequented and utilized four slips in the Inner Harbour of Toronto. Two western boat slips are adjacent to some natural features and have undergone some rehabilitation to increase the complexity of aquatic habitat (i.e. addition of large substrate, overhead cover, and in-water structure). In contrast, the two eastern slips are deeper and more influenced by the turbid Don River. We assessed the timing and duration of occupancy within all four slips for seven fish species using acoustic telemetry. In just under a year, tagged fishes spent a limited amount of time in any one slip. However, there was evidence for increased use at the two western slips by Northern Pike (Esox lucius) in spring, which is likely linked to the proximity of these slips to a known spawning area. Overall, there was no reliable evidence that the majority of the seven adult fish species evaluated frequented either the western or eastern slips. Despite efforts to track and tag a variety of species, insufficient detections prevented a detailed assessment of habitat selection for the majority of species of interest. A more detailed study of the spatial ecology of these fishes is therefore needed to understand the scale of their habitat use and inform the design of habitat rehabilitation projects for hardened shorelines.					wells, mathew/A-7101-2012; Cooke, Steven/F-4193-2010	Cooke, Steven/0000-0002-5407-0659; wells, mathew/0000-0003-3838-9202													1463-4988	1539-4077					2018	21	3			SI		331	341		10.1080/14634988.2018.1507530	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14634988.2018.1507530													WOS:000446707400012

In North America as elsewhere in the world, changes in water resources strongly impact agriculture and animal husbandry. From a combination of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) gravity and Global Positioning System (GPS) data, it is recently found that water storage from August, 2002 to March, 2011 recovered after the extreme Canadian Prairies drought between 1999 and 2005. In this paper, we use GRACE monthly gravity data of Release 5 to track the water storage change from August, 2002 to June, 2014. In Canadian Prairies and the Great Lakes areas, the total water storage is found to have increased during the last decade by a rate of 73.8 +/- 14.5 Gt/a, which is larger than that found in the previous study due to the longer time span of GRACE observations used and the reduction of the leakage error. We also find a long term decrease of water storage at a rate of -12.0 +/- 4.2 Gt/a in Ungava Peninsula, possibly due to permafrost degradation and less snow accumulation during the winter in the region. In addition, the effect of total mass gain in the surveyed area, on present-day sea level, amounts to -0.18 mm/a, and thus should be taken into account in studies of global sea level change.

J	Jenkinson, DS				Jenkinson, DS			The impact of humans on the nitrogen cycle, with focus on temperate arable agriculture	PLANT AND SOIL					10th International Nitrogen Workshop	AUG 23-26, 1999	ROYAL AGR & VET UNIV, COPENHAGEN, DENMARK	Riso Natl Lab	ROYAL AGR & VET UNIV			The 6 billion people alive today consume about 25 million tonnes of protein nitrogen each year, a requirement that could well increase to 40-45 million tonnes by 2050. Most of them ultimately depend on the Haber-Bosch process to fix the atmospheric N-2 needed to grow at least part of their protein and, over the earth as a whole, this dependency is likely to increase. Humans now fix some 160 million tonnes of nitrogen per year, of which 98 are fixed industrially by the Haber-Bosch process (83 for use as agricultural fertilizer, 15 for industry), 22 during combustion and the rest is fixed during the cultivation of leguminous crops and fodders. These 160 million tonnes have markedly increased the burden of combined nitrogen entering rivers, lakes and shallow seas, as well as increasing the input of NH3, N2O, NO and NO2 to the atmosphere. Nitrogen fertilizers give large economic gains in modern farming systems and under favourable conditions can be used very efficiently. Losses of nitrogen occur from all systems of agriculture, with organic manures being particularly difficult to use efficiently. Although nitrate leaching has received much attention as an economic loss, a cause of eutrophication and a health hazard, gaseous emissions may eventually prove to be the most serious environmentally. Scientists working on the use and fate of nitrogen fertilizers must be careful, clear headed and vigilant in looking for unexpected side effects.																			0032-079X	1573-5036				JAN	2001	228	1					3	15		10.1023/A:1004870606003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1004870606003													WOS:000166362800002

Contrasting energy pathways suggest differing susceptibility of pelagic fishes to an invasive ecosystem engineer in a large lake system	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Species invasions can lead to ecological regime shifts by altering food web structure and changing nutrient cycling. Stable isotopes are a powerful tool to understand the potential and realized impacts of invasive species on food webs, especially when used in tandem with other dietary tracers. An invasion by one of the most notorious freshwater invaders in North America, the quagga mussel (Dreissena bugensis), is imminent in Lake Champlain, United States. An invasion by this filter feeder has the potential to drastically alter energy pathways and destabilize pelagic fisheries via bottom-up impacts. However, the extent and magnitude of these impacts depend on the current food web structure of the mid-trophic pelagic food web, which was previously not well described. We used Bayesian stable isotope mixing models informed by stomach content analysis to identify which energy pathways are currently most important to mid-trophic level fishes. We determined that in the Main Lake basin, the spring phytoplankton bloom and deep chlorophyll layer - the resources most vulnerable to quagga mussels - provide a disproportionate amount of support to the pelagic food web via zooplankton and the migrating macroinvertebrate Mysis. The food web in the Northeast Arm of Lake Champlain is supported by epilimnetic phytoplankton, which is more protected from the filtration effects of quagga mussels than the deep chlorophyll layer. However, the Northeast Arm will likely not provide a high-quality foraging refuge to coldwater pelagic fish due to unfavorable oxythermal conditions. The mid-trophic food web of Lake Champlain-and consequently piscivores who rely on these prey-may be vulnerable to the impending quagga mussel invasion if migratory Mysis are not able to shift their diet to benthic resources.

J	Interlandi, SJ; Kilham, SS				Interlandi, SJ; Kilham, SS			Limiting resources and the regulation of diversity in phytoplankton communities	ECOLOGY												Species diversity is a key concept in ecology, yet the mechanisms regulating diversity in most systems are not completely understood. To address this issue, we analyzed the relationship between phytoplankton diversity and limiting resources (N, P, Si, and light) over two summers in three lakes in the Yellowstone (Wyoming, USA) region. Diversity was highly variable along temporal and spatial axes within lakes. We discovered a strong positive correlation between diversity and the number of resources at physiologically limiting levels. Consistent with resource-competition theory, we found the highest diversity to occur when many resources were limiting. Conversely, the lowest diversity occurred when few resources were measured at limiting levels. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that threshold levels of resources (below which growth is limited and above which there is saturation for the resource) appear to exist in the natural environment, and that diversity is regulated in part by absolute levels of resources available to phytoplankton in aquatic systems. Threshold levels are generally in agreement with those determined to be limiting in prior physiological experiments. Consistent with previous observations, among-lake comparisons yielded a significant negative relationship between species diversity and system productivity. This result tentatively supports the hypothesis that the proximity of individual phytoplankton plays a role in the strength of competitive interactions. Our results generally suggest that, even in dynamic environments, where equilibrium conditions are rare, resource competition among phytoplankton is a mechanism by which communities are continually structured.																			0012-9658	1939-9170				MAY	2001	82	5					1270	1282		10.2307/2679988	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2679988													WOS:000168844200006

The effects of climate change on aquatic ecosystems are ex-pected in all biomes, and in Alpine environments in particular. Anthropogenic pressure (e.g., chemical pollution) besides climate change impact on the state and quality of aquatic systems in which climate change and envi-ronmental contaminants can interact. To better understand the effect of increases in temperature and environ-mental pollution on high-mountain lakes, we performed an ecotoxicological assay on Daphnia middendorffiana collected during summer 2021 in a high-mountain lake (Upper Balma Lake, Cottian Alps, 2212 m a.s.L.). Samples were exposed to two temperature values (15 degrees C and 20 degrees C), potassium chloride (KCl) as the reference toxicant, and D. magna as the model organism for comparison. Findings showed immobilization after exposure to KCl in both species, but exposure to non-optimal water temperature (20 degrees C and 15 degrees C for D. middendorffiana and D. magna, respectively) enhanced this effect. The mean half-maximal effective concentration (EC50; 24 h) for D. middendorffiana was significantly lower than that recorded for D. magna exposed to 20 degrees C (KCl) (46.9 mg/L vs 255 mg/L). A significantly higher EC50 (273.4 mg/L; 24 h) was recorded for D. middendorffiana exposed to 15 degrees C (KCl) compared to D. magna (EC50 50.6 mg/L; 24 h). Our findings suggest that the combined effects of tem-perature and chemical pollution may severely affect the occurrence of D. middendorffiana, which occupies a central position in the food webs of high-mountain lakes in the Alps.

Temporal trends, lake-to-lake variation, and climate effects on Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) mercury concentrations from six High Arctic lakes in Nunavut, Canada	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Climate warming and mercury (Hg) are concurrently influencing Arctic ecosystems, altering their functioning and threatening food security. Non-anadromous Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) in small lakes were used to biomonitor these two anthropogenic stressors, because this iconic Arctic species is a long-lived top predator in relatively simple food webs, and yet population characteristics vary greatly, reflecting differences between lake systems. Mercury concentrations in six landlocked Arctic char populations on Comwallis Island, Nunavut have been monitored as early as 1989, providing a novel dataset to examine differences in musde (Hg] among char populations, temporal trends, and the relationship between climate patterns and Arctic char [Hg]. We found significant lake-to-lake differences in length-adjusted Arctic char muscle (Hg], which varied by up to 9-fold Arctic char muscle [Hg] was significantly correlated to dissolved and particulate organic carbon concentrations in water: neither watershed area or vegetation cover explained differences. Three lakes exhibited significant temporal declines in length-adjusted (Hg] in Arctic char; the other three lakes had no significant trends. Though precipitation, temperature, wind speed, and sea ice duration were tested, no single climate variable was significantly correlated to length-adjusted [Hg] across populations. However, Arctic char Hg in Resolute Lake exhibited a significant correlation with sea ice duration, which is likely closely linked to lake ice duration, and which may impact Hg processing in lakes. Additionally, Arctic char [Hg] in Amituk Lake was significantly correlated to snow fall, which may be linked to Hg deposition. The lack of consistent temporal trends in neighboring char populations indicates that currently, within lake processes are the strongest drivers of [Hg] in char in the study lakes and potentially in other Arctic lakes, and that the influence of climate change will likely vary from lake to lake.

Arg. populations as revealed by amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs)	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY												Uapaca kirkiana is a priority fruit tree species for domestication in miombo woodlands of Southern Africa. Natural populations of U. kirkiana are declining through out the woodlands due to deforestation, forest fragmentation and wildfires. Knowledge of population structure and genetic diversity is prerequisite for development of conservation strategies. Amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) were used to assess the genetic diversity of eight populations from three geographical regions of Malawi. AFLP markers revealed moderate differentiation (GST = 0.079) among the populations collected from the three regions, however, there were no significant genetic variations among the regional collections. Analyses of molecular variance (AMOVA) found very high variation (92%) among individuals within populations and 6.8% among populations. The variations between populations indicate that populations can not be considered a single panmictic unit. Analyses of genetic similarity based on unweighted pair group method of arithmetic averages (UPGMA) suggested that the 8 populations fall into three clusters with 5 populations in one cluster, two in another and the lake shore population of Chesamu in its own cluster. Based on results presented it would be cost effective to sample a small number of populations represented by a large number of individuals for germplasm conservation purposes. In view of the wide distribution of U. kirkiana in the miombo woodlands in Southern Africa there is need for a more intensive genetic study to include populations growing in different countries to produce a wider picture of levels of distribution of genetic diversity of the species.																			1684-5315					JUL 3	2006	5	13					1205	1213																WOS:000238977900005

Rearings were conducted at several constant temperatures. Differences between geographic strains and between sexes within strains were significant in nearly every instance (P < 0.01). At cool temperatures (13-17.degree. C) the GA strain developed more quickly; this trend was reversed at intermediate temperatures (18-20.degree. C) and at 21.degree. C only GA males developed faster than DL males. With few exceptions, both sexes of the GA strain required more cumulative degree-days for development than their northern counterparts. The number of instars was determined for each strain by measuring the length of the postgena of head capsules collected during warm (21.degree. C) and cool (13.degree. C) rearings. Although both strains pass through 7 stadia, differences between strains were noted in the size of middle instars. In all rearings sexual dimorphism was evident in the morphology of last-instar head capsules; in rearings conducted at cool temperatures (13.degree. C), sexes could also be separated by the size of last-instar head capsules. Strains were crossed and their progeny reared. High values for net reproductive rate (RO), fecundity and adult survival suggest that heterosis resulted from crossbreeding the 2 geographic strains.

In the period 1980-1988 characean biomass strongly decreased and only two species, Chara globularis and C connivens, remained in small populations at a few localities. Of the macrophyte Najas marina also some small populations remained, while the aquatic moss Fontinalis antipyretica and the filamentous alga Vaucheria dichotoma predominated at many sites. These phenomena may have been due to eutrophication by the input of polluted water. This process of impoverishment was stopped by restoration measures in 1989, resulting in a lower phosphorus concentration (ca 25 mug l-1) and a higher water transparency. Immediately after these measures the Characeae community increased in abundance and number of species. During the summer of 1990, and especially 1991, a spectacular growth occurred of Chara connivens. C. connivens was often accompanied by C. major. Other species with scattered occurrence were C. aculeolata, C. aspera, C. contraria and C. globularis. The reasons for the shift in dominance from Nitellopsis obtusa to Chara connivens are discussed. From growth experiments evidence was obtained that neither the recent higher chloride level, nor the lowered phosphate concentration were the main factors for the domination of Chara connivens.																			0018-8158					FEB 25	1994	275						243	253		10.1007/BF00026715	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00026715													WOS:A1994NB19800022
J	JOHNSON, MW				JOHNSON, MW			OBSERVATIONS ON INSHORE PLANKTON COLLECTED DURING SUMMER 1957 AT POINT-BARROW, ALASKA	JOURNAL OF MARINE RESEARCH												Analyses of 34 net tows, collected July 16 to August 16, 1957 to depths of about 66 m, were concerned mainly with the microplankton. The concentration of plankton varied greatly while the composition remained quite uniform. Acartia longiremis, Oithona similis and Pseudocalanus minutus were the most abundant copepods. Other species of Calanoida recorded include Acartia clausi, especially in Nuwuk Pond; Calanus finmarchicus, C. hyperboreus, Centropages mcmurrichi, Epilabidocera amphitrites, Eurytemora herdmani; and Tortanus discaudatus. The presence of nauplii and early copepodid stages of E. amphitrites and T. discaudatus are of interest in demonstrating some reproduction by these more southerly forms on the Arctic coast and in pointing to a tenuous faunal connection of the east and west coast populations of T. discaudatus. The macroplankton, especially Limacina helicina, Clione limicina and Thysanoessa raschii, were most conspicuous following heavy on-shore winds bringing in ice. The temporary zooplankton consisted mainly of pelecypod, gastropod, annelid, barnacle, echinoderm and brachyuran larvae. Clypeasteroid plutei were common, although benthic adults have not been reported from the immediate area. Fish larvae were rare. Results from culturing of copepods up to August 15 show that single isolated females of Cyclops from Imikpuk Lake are capable of producing a minimum of 3 successive broods without additional fertilization over the period.																			0022-2402	1543-9542					1958	17						272	281																WOS:A1958WW07600021

Abrupt increase in east Indonesian rainfall from flooding of the Sunda Shelf ∼9500 years ago	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												We present a precisely dated, multi-proxy stalagmite record from Liang Luar Cave, Flores (southeast Indonesia) that reveals a rapid increase in Indonesian monsoon rainfall at similar to 9.5 ka. A "ramp-fitting" method for detecting statistically significant inflections in a time-series was applied to the stalagmite delta O-18 Mg/Ca, and Sr/Ca profiles to quantify the precise timing and magnitude of an abrupt increase in monsoon strength over a period of similar to 350 years. Previously published lake-level records from the monsoon-affected Australian interior show a sudden intensification of the Australian monsoon at similar to 14 ka. However, our records indicate that monsoon intensification in Flores occured similar to 4-5 kyr later. The timing of the monsoon shift in Flores is synchronous with the rapid expansion of rainforest in northeast Australia and regional freshening of the southern Makassar Strait which, under present-day conditions, is sensitive to monsoon variability. The freshening of southern Makassar was coeval with an abrupt similar to 1.5 degrees C cooling in the upper thermocline of the Timor Sea similar to 9.5 ka, indicative of reduced surface heat transport by the Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) when the Java Sea opened during postglacial sea-level rise. This suggests that the abrupt increase in monsoon rainfall on Flores was not due to a change in the ITF - because a decrease in rainfall would be expected to accompany cooler local sea surface temperatures (SSTs) - but rather by the sudden increase in ocean surface area and/or temperature in the monsoon source region as the Sunda Shelf flooded during deglaciation. We propose that it was the abrupt intensification of the monsoon through the late deglaciation that maintained the subsequent structure of the ITF following the flooding of the Sunda Shelf at similar to 9.5 ka.

A bather can add to a lake up to 94 mg total P and 3115 mg total N daily. The largest amount of nutrients (98% P-total, 45% N-total) comes from urinary excretions of the bathers. The public bathing area of Klagenfurt in lake Woerthersee a small pond, used for bathing, near Ferlach were compared in the summers of 1976 and 1979, respectively, to establish the effect of P and N input by bathers on the water quality of a large and a small lake. An increase in the total P concentration could be seen in both lakes on days when there were a lot of bathers. This increase results from the amount of P which the bathers bring into the lake and from the P which comes from the sediment that the bathers stirred up. There was a significant correlation to the daily increase in P and the number of bathers in both lakes. There was only a relatively slight increase in concentrations of dissolved P registered on days when there was a very large number of bathers. The dissolved P bound to particles suspended in water and was thus measured altogether as total P. The NH4-N concentration in both lakes was also affected by the bathers. The daily increase in concentration was positively correlated to the number of bathers. Contrary to the NH4-N the nitrate-N content seemed to decrease on days when the number of bathers was high. The daily increase in nutrient concentrations was notably greater in the smaller lake near Ferlach than in the bathing area of Klagenfurt, where the number of bathers was significantly higher. The amount of nutrients which the bathers add to the water only effected the water quality of the 2 lakes for a short period. Both lakes recovered during the night. During bathing season no enrichment of nutrients could be registered within the bathing areas. The nutrient input by bathers is of little consequence in large lakes. In smaller lakes which are used by many bathers, bathing can be a significant source of eutrification.																			0174-3015						1981	173	6					528	548											7324615					WOS:A1981MQ73400017
J	Stroujkova, AF; Malin, PE				Stroujkova, AF; Malin, PE			A magma mass beneath Casa Diablo? Further evidence from reflected seismic waves	BULLETIN OF THE SEISMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												A forty-station seismographic network operating in Long Valley caldera in California during the summer of 1997 recorded a number of earthquakes with unusual secondary phases. The phases can be seen on several stations throughout the network, allowing the use of particle motions and differential travel times to examine their nature and points of origin. Based on amplitude, frequency, and travel-time considerations, it appears that some of the phases are mode-converted S-to-P reflections from a zone below the Casa Diablo area near Mammoth Lakes, CA. The locus of reflection points was imaged using time-domain signal migration and stacking under the assumptions of first-order scattering theory. The results indicate that the reflecting zone is a curved, 1.5 km by 2 km surface 7.6 km below and 1.4 km west of the Casa Diablo geothermal plant. Previous studies show low P-wave velocities and high S-wave attenuations in the same location as the reflecting zone. An amplitude analysis of the suspected reflections suggests they are produced by large contrasts in material properties, with the possible range of transitions including solid to partially molten or dry to fluid-saturated rock. Given these observations plus the volcanic history of the caldera and its recent tectonic activity, the most straightforward interpretation of the reflections is that they come from either the top of a sill or intrusion, or the overlying hydrothermal system of such structures.					; Stroujkova, Anastasia/JTU-9733-2023	Stroujkova, Anastasia/0000-0003-3196-0170; 													0037-1106					APR	2000	90	2					500	511		10.1785/0119990071	http://dx.doi.org/10.1785/0119990071													WOS:000087058000019

Tubes containing semi-solid agar, incubated in sediment cores gave good enrichments of Peloploca spp. The organisms, which had the form of helical bundles of filaments. The organisms, which had the forms of helical bundles of filaments, were seen to corkscrew through the agar at up to 2-3 .mu.m s-1. The vertical distribution of Peloploca spp. in the sediment and water column of a eutrophic lake was examined periodically during summer stratification. The organisms were confined to anoxic conditions in the sediment prior to stratification. With increasing anoxia in the hypolimnion, the population shifted upwards in the sediment and towards the end of stratification, in the most reducing conditions, appeared in the lower hypolimnion. Anaerobically incubated sediment cores also showed that movement of the Peloploca population from sediment into the overlying water. The gliding motility and helical morphology of Peloploca bundles may enable them to migrate through sediment in response to O2 and Eh gradients, in addition to their use of gas vacuoles to adjust their position in the water column. The taxonomic implications of gliding motility in Peloploca spp. are discussed.																			0302-8933	1432-072X					1984	140	1					44	49		10.1007/BF00409770	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00409770													WOS:A1984AEN1800008

With increased application of Sentinel-1 data for avalanche detection, the need for improved performance evaluation arises. In this study, we make use of a unique dataset of field-based avalanche observations from eight adjacent avalanche paths at lake Tyin in central Norway. The dataset is a complete record of 318 dry slab avalanches that released during the winters 2016-2020, with information on release timing and extent. The dataset thus allows for detailed evaluation of the performance of automatic and manual avalanche detection in Sentinel-1 images, were both techniques make use of relative temporal backscatter intensity increase in case of an avalanche. Both automatic and manual detection underperform compared to previous studies with a probability of detection (POD) of 5.9% (false alarm rate (FAR) of 5.9%) and 11.3% (FAR of 19.27%) respectively. From the low relative backscatter intensity contrast of fieldobserved dry slab avalanches, it becomes evident that a higher backscatter contrast between avalanches and surrounding is needed for detectability in Sentinel-1 images. Neither the lag time between avalanche release and detection in a Sentinel-1 image, nor local incidence angle can explain the low POD's. Moreover, an analysis of meteorological conditions prior a during avalanche release and/or detection can explain the low POD's, given that differing snow conditions influence radar backscatter intensity. Finally, we cannot rule out that the small dataset of field-observed avalanches and the one-directional slope aspect of the study area influence our results, however, we believe that a physical limit of detectability of dry snow avalanches in C-band radar satellite data is reached.																			0165-232X	1872-7441				JUN	2022	198								103549	10.1016/j.coldregions.2022.103549	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.coldregions.2022.103549		MAR 2022											WOS:000795154000003

Yorkshire: stratigraphy and sedimentology of the Last Glacial-Interglacial Transition (LGIT) lacustrine sequences	PROCEEDINGS OF THE GEOLOGISTS ASSOCIATION												The basal topography and sediments recording the Last Glacial-Interglacial Transition (LGIT) from Palaeolake Flixton, North Yorkshire have been reinvestigated by a detailed auger and borehole survey. The data presented here, from the area to the north of Flixton Island and the River Hertford, suggests the basal topography of Palaeolake Flixton is irregular with deep and areally small basins interspersed within a gravel surface ca. 21 m OD. At its shallowest the gravel surface is ca. 2 m below current land surface and the deeper, steep-sided basins are up to 9 m in depth. Examination of the sediment sequences indicates the deeper basins accumulate sediments from the Dimlington Stadial (DS), Windermere Interstadial (WI), Loch Lomond Stadial (LLS) and the Holocene, whilst the shallower sequences only record the Holocene. The configuration of the deposits in the basins suggest that lake levels declined during the WI from 24 to 23 m OD and then fell further during the LLS to ca. 20.90 m OD. The lake water levels then rose slowly during the Holocene to a height of between 23 and 24 m OD. These fluctuations in lake water level at the transition from the LLS to Holocene perhaps indicate that the configuration of the water body during the resettlement of the area in the Mesolithic was different to previous reconstructions, with lower water levels and a greater area of land exposed for habitation. This highlights the potential for additional preservation of archaeological assemblages in the area of the former lake. Moreover the complex basal stratigraphy suggests that a systematic analyses of the Palaeolake Flixton sedimentary archive is required to resolve high-resolution palaeoclimate data from this lake sequence.

J	LOVVORN, JR				LOVVORN, JR			BIOMECHANICS AND FORAGING PROFITABILITY - AN APPROACH TO ASSESSING TROPHIC NEEDS AND IMPACTS OF DIVING DUCKS	HYDROBIOLOGIA												A biomechanical model of underwater locomotion is described, and data required by the model presented for 3 species of diving duck (Aythya spp.). Based on field observations of behavior and foods consumed, the model is used to estimate energy costs of foraging and minimum food intake rates of canvasbacks (Aythya valisineria) in two habitats in North Carolina. Increased water depth from 0.5 m in Lake Mattamuskeet to 1.5 m in Pamlico Sound increased the net cost of time spent foraging at the bottom by 43%. Biomechanical calculations are combined with data on intake rates at different food densities (Takekawa, 1987) to determine minimum food densities for profitable foraging in Lake Mattamuskeet. Field observations of behavior are used to adjust minimum intake per dive for unsuccessful dives spent locating food patches. Density and dispersion of plant tuber foods in Lake Mattamuskeet, before and after the fall staging period, suggest that the fraction of habitat with tuber densities above a profitability threshold is more critical to canvasbacks than average tuber density. Such factors are important in relating bird energy requirements and benthic sampling data to carrying capacity and total area of usable habitat. The proportion of foods that can be fed upon profitably also determines the fraction of food organisms subject to depletion as components of trophic pathways.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				APR 1	1994	279						223	233		10.1007/BF00027856	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00027856													WOS:A1994NK39900022
J	Buonaiuto, FS; Kraus, NC				Buonaiuto, FS; Kraus, NC			Limiting slopes and depths at ebb-tidal shoals	COASTAL ENGINEERING												Dense bathymetry surveys obtained by LIDAR at 13 small to medium coastal inlets of the continental United States were analyzed to quantify limiting (maximum) bottom slopes of ebb shoals and entrance channels. The LIDAR data were supplemented with conventional bathyrnetry measurements from five large inlets to obtain predictive relationships for the limiting (minimum) depth over crest of the ebb shoal. The sites, all located on sandy coasts, were chosen to cover a range in tidal amplitude, tidal prism, and average annual wave height. Wave-dominated inlets exhibited steeper slopes on their seaward margins than tide-dominated inlets. Slopes on ebb shoals typically do not exceed 4-6degrees, with seaward slopes being 1-2degrees steeper than landward slopes. Dredged entrance channels have steeper slopes than natural channels, with maximum slopes immediately after dredging reaching 6-8degrees. At one inlet having a series of LIDAR surveys, entrance channel maintenance dredging created 3-5degrees side slopes that decreased 0.5-1/year for the next 2 years to achieve a typical slope of 3degrees along much of the channel. Greatest bottom slopes are found in scour holes near jetties (10-12degrees) and at the entrance bars (8-10degrees) of (tideless) Great Lakes harbors. Limiting depth over crest of the ebb shoals is predicted well by the parameter (HsP)(1/4), where H-S is the average annual significant wave height, and P is the spring tidal prism. High correlation was also found between limiting depth and prism, and with limiting depth and wave height. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Activity traps and sweep nets were used to sample macroinvertebrates during the summer months of 1992 and 1993. Twenty-four sites on the lake were sampled along six established transects. Each site was located in one of four different habitats, including three major macrophyte communities: Typha angustifolia Scirpus acutus, Potamogeton spp., and an open water site having little or no vegetation. The diversity, relative abundance, and biomass of the invertebrates collected from each vegetation type were compared to assess which type of vegetation supported the greatest numbers and most diverse invertebrate fauna. A total of 16 orders, 46 families and 93 genera were identified. Results suggest that the open water sites produced the largest number of organisms, whereas the Typha sites produced the greatest total biomass of invertebrates. Nine orders showed significant differences in abundance among vegetation communities, but there were no significant differences in biomass of orders among vegetation types. There were significant differences in the mean diversities among vegetation community types. Typha sites supported the most diverse populations of macroinvertebrates and the open sites produced the least diverse populations. The abundance of six orders was significantly different between years and may be attributed to fluctuating water levels. Our results suggest that the occurrence and abundance of certain macrophyte communities may enhance the quality of a marsh for consumers of macroinvertebrates.																			0270-5060					DEC	1995	10	4					325	335		10.1080/02705060.1995.9663455	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1995.9663455													WOS:A1995TJ40400003

Incidence of multiple antibiotic resistant Gram-negative bacteria isolated from surface and underground water sources in south western region of Nigeria	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												In most rural and urban settlements, particularly in Nigeria, wells, spring, streams or rivers and lakes serves as major sources of water supply for drinking and other domestic purposes. Unfortunately, many of the available water sources are not potable without some form of treatment which is seldom available in most settings. The use of untreated surface water sources for drinking and for domestic purposes remains a major threat to public health as these could serve as reservoirs the for transfer of antibiotic resistant pathogens. The incidence of resistant bacteria isolated from surface and underground water in six rural settlements in Ekiti State Nigeria was thus investigated. Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from wells, streams and boreholes in six rural settlements in Ekiti State Nigeria between January and April, 2006 and the prevalence of organisms exhibiting multiple antibiotic resistance to tetracycline, amoxicillin, cotrimoxazole, nitofurantoin, gentamicin, nalidixic acid and ofloxacin was observed. Gram-negative bacterial isolates comprised Escherichia coli (22.7%), Enterobacter aerogenes (2.5%), Salmonella spp. (13.3%), Shigella spp. (19.3%), Proteus spp. (18.5%), Klebsiella spp. ( 19.3%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.2%). Over 10% of the bacteria were resistant to four or more antibiotic. Antibiotic resistance was highest in members of the genera Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, and Proteus. Given the prevalence of appalling sanitary facilities and inappropriate public antibiotic use, the possibility of antibiotic resistance selection, faecal dissemination and subsequent contamination of local water sources available for rural residents of the developing world is highlighted. The implication for clinical practice of infections caused by antibiotic resistant strains especially among immunodeficient individuals is also discussed.					; Dada, Ayokunle/T-4211-2019; Odeyemi, Adebowale/AHD-5810-2022	Odeyemi, Adebowale/0000-0002-8524-464X; DADA, AYOKUNLE CHRISTOPHER/0000-0001-9913-4284													0273-1223	1996-9732					2009	59	10					1929	1936		10.2166/wst.2009.219	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.2009.219								19474486					WOS:000266782800006
J	Sampson, CJ; Brezonik, PL				Sampson, CJ; Brezonik, PL			Responses of nutrients to experimental acidification and recovery in Little Rock Lake, USA	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Nutrient concentrations and cycling processes were studied in Little Rock Lake, Wisconsin, U.S.A., during experimental acidification from pH 6.1 to target pH values of 5.6, 5.1 and 4.7 and during the first four years of recovery. Surface water concentrations of ammonium, nitrate, soluble reactive phosphate, and total phosphate were not affected, but total nitrogen was lower from year 2 at pH 5.6 until the end of recovery year 3 (pH 5.3). The decrease was attributed to lower dissolved organic N. Annual maximum concentrations of N and P forms at 9 m depth in the hypolimnion increased with decreasing pH, but most of the increase resulted from a drought-induced decline in lake level during acidification that brought the 9 m sampling location closer to the sediment. In contrast to findings elsewhere, acidification of Little Rock Lake had no effect on rates of nitrification during winter ice-cover. Dissolved silica concentrations increased slightly at pH 4.7, probably because of a pH-induced decrease in the diatom population, but hydrologic factors were more important in controlling silica levels than was pH. Most of the predictive hypotheses made about the effects of acidification on nutrient forms and processes or their recovery in the lake were qualitatively correct.

The metabolism of 3rd and 4th instar larvae was examined in regard to variation in biomass and temperature. Respiration at air saturation was described by a curvilinear multiple regression relating oxygen consumption to individual AFDW and temperature. At 10-degrees-C and varying oxygen regimes the O2 consumption and CO2 production of 4th instar larvae were almost unaltered from saturation to about 3 mg O2 1(-1), but decreased steeply below this level. The respiratory quotient increased from 0.82 at saturation to about 3.4 at oxygen concentrations near 0.5 mg O2 1(-1). This implied a shift from aerobic to partially anaerobic metabolism. At 0.5 mg O2 1(-1) the total energy production equalled 20% of the rate at saturation of which more than one third was accounted for by anaerobic degradation of glycogen. This corresponded to a daily, loss of 12 mug mg AFDW-1 or approximately 5% of the body reserves. At unchanged metabolic rate the glycogen store would last three weeks, but long term oxygen deficiency causes a further suppression of the energy metabolism in C. anthracinus.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				DEC 2	1994	294	1					43	50		10.1007/BF00017624	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00017624													WOS:A1994QG90300007

In the case of the Koktokay Global Geopark (GGp), for example, in this study, we used GIS spatial analysis, SBE, and a questionnaire survey method to construct a comprehensive evaluation path and method for an audio-visual landscape for global geoparks and further built an audio-visual preference matrix. The research results show the following: (1) The Shenzhong Canyon scenic area has the best visual evaluation effect, whereas the Golden Triangle has the worst evaluation effect. (2) Tourists are generally satisfied with the soundscapes of the ten scenic locations in the Koktokay GGp. In addition, tourists do not think that a higher or lower volume of a soundscape would make their experience more comfortable or pleasant, so an increase in the threshold value of the sound level to a level that tourists can bear while traveling is possible. (3) The Shenzhong Canyon area is located in the key landscape area; the Aiguzi Mine and Cocosuri are located in the landscape natural development area; the No. 3 Mine Pit, Eremu Lakes, the Golden Triangle, and the Karadrola Falls are located in the landscape subpriority improvement area; and the Waterfall Fossil, Betula Forest, and Karashanger Earthquake Fault Zone are located in the landscape priority improvement area. The comprehensive audio-visual landscape evaluation method constructed in this study provides a methodological tool for evaluating other similar landscapes and provides professional guidance for the protection and development of geoparks.

The effects of mycorrhizae on phosphorus mitigation and pollinator habitat restoration within riparian buffers on unceded land	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Agricultural pollution, especially phosphorus (P) can cause eutrophication of freshwater quality. Riparian buffers are best management practices (BMPs) which intercept agricultural pollution. However, they are frequently degraded by reduced biodiversity. P mitigation in riparian buffers can be enhanced through mycorrhizal inoculation and cyclical coppicing. We report on a myco-phytoremediation project that investigates mycorrhizae's effect on vegetation's ability to lower legacy soil P, soil water P, and increase woody biomass P uptake. It also aimed to restore pollinator habitat through planting a diverse, native plant palette (32 species), blooming from February to November. Planting and offering culturally relevant plant materials to the Abenaki contributes to their land rematriation process. The study was located on unceded Abenaki territory at Shelburne Farms, within 300 m of Lake Pitawbagw (Lake Champlain) which is impacted increasingly by P pollution from colonial and conventional agricultural practices. Along a drainage way three treatment plots were installed: buckthorn vegetation (OIV) left in place as the control, and two restored diverse multi-synusium plant communities, consisting of either uninoculated (RV) or inoculated with 19 mycorrhizal species (RVM). After 2 years, soil water soluble reactive P extracted from lysimeter samples was not affected by treatment but varied over time. However, water extractable SRP (WEP-SRP) and TP (WEP-TP) followed this trend RV > OIV > RVM which was inversely and linearly related to mycorrhizal density. Plants are best harvested in late summer when P concentrations are highest.

J	Vincent, WF; Mueller, DR; Bonilla, S				Vincent, WF; Mueller, DR; Bonilla, S			Ecosystems on ice: the microbial ecology of Markham Ice Shelf in the high Arctic	CRYOBIOLOGY					Annual Joint Meeting of the Society-for-Cryobiology/Society-for-Low-Temperature-Biology	SEP 14-18, 2003	Univ Coimbra, Coimbra, PORTUGAL	Soc Cryobiol, Soc Low Temp Biol	Univ Coimbra			Microbial communities occur throughout the cryosphere in a diverse range of ice-dominated habitats including snow, sea ice, glaciers, permafrost, and ice clouds. In each of these environments, organisms must be capable of surviving freeze-thaw cycles, persistent low temperatures for growth, extremes of solar radiation, and prolonged dormancy. These constraints may have been especially important during global cooling events in the past, including the Precambrian glaciations. One analogue of these early Earth conditions is the thick, landfast sea ice that occurs today at certain locations in the Arctic and Antarctic. These ice shelves contain liquid water for a brief period each summer, and support luxuriant microbial mat communities. Our recent studies of these mats on the Markham Ice Shelf (Canadian high Arctic) by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) showed that they contain high concentrations of chlorophylls a and b, and several carotenoids notably lutein, echinenone and beta-carotene. The largest peaks in the HPLC chromatograms were two UV-screening compounds known to be produced by cyanobacteria, scytonemin, and its decomposition product scytonemin-red. Microscopic analyses of the mats showed that they were dominated by the chlorophyte genera cf. Chlorosarcinopsis, Pleurastrum, Palmellopsis, and Bracteococcus, and cyanobacteria of the genera Nostoc, Phormidium, Leptolyngbya, and Gloeocapsa. From point transects and localized sampling we estimated a total standing stock on this ice shelf of up to 11,200 tonnes of organic matter. These observations underscore the ability of microbial communities to flourish despite the severe constraints imposed by the cryo-ecosystem environment. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Geochemistry of the Bottom Sediments of Lake Peyungda, Tunguska Nature Reserve, and Paleoclimatic Reconstructions of the Arctic Territories of Eastern Siberia	GEOCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL												Lake Peyungda contains annually layered bottom sediments (varves), which make it possible to build a reliable age model for the entire depth of the core. An age model was refined over the last century based on the presence of a layer of anomalous thickness associated with the fall of the Tunguska cosmic body (TCB) in June 1908. The results of scanning mu XRF-SI (elemental analysis along core depth) were used for comparison with regional average annual weather observation data over the time span of 1895-2000 to create a transfer function: average annual temperature as a function of the elemental composition of the dated layer of bottom sediment. Approximation of the obtained function to the depth of core sampling made it possible to reconstruct changes in regional temperature over the time interval of the last millennium with an annual time resolution. Comparison of the obtained reconstruction with literature data on reconstructions for the Arctic region over the past 1000 years shows the presence of general trends and extremes, which confirms the reliability of the obtained results.

However, existing studies have paid little attention on the understanding of the feedback relationships among oxygen consumption, algal succession and greenhouse gas effect after river damming, particularly in Three Gorges Reservoir. This field work investigated the thermal stratification, water quality and phytoplankton in four tributaries (Pengxi Bay (PXB), Daning Bay (DNB), Shennong Bay (SNB), and Xiangxi Bay (XXB)) of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) in spring (April 25-28, 2022), and explored the drivers of hypoxia and its feedback response to algal blooms and methane (CH4) emissions. The results showed that during the observation period, DO, thermal stratification, and algal blooms were more severe in PXB. The high Chemical Oxygen Demand (CODMn) (11.27 mg center dot L-1) and Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) content (7.56 mg center dot L-1) in PXB were the main causes of the progressive hypoxia. Furthermore, stronger density stratification in PXB inhibited the vertical supply of DO and accelerated bottom hypoxia. But the downslope density current replenished bottom DO in the upper reaches of the DNB, SNB, and XXB. The CH4 concentration was generally higher in hypoxia zone, especially in where cyanobacteria are the dominant species (eg., PX03 and PX04). Dam construction led to the succession of algal-dominant species, exerting a significant influence on the river carbon cycle. The expansion of cyanobacterial blooms and the consequence of metabolic substrates increase are gradually increasing oxygen deprivation, even hypoxia, and enhancing CH4 production in rivers. These findings suggest that the succession of algal-dominant species caused by river damming has a pronounced positive feedback effect on reservoir hypoxia processes and greenhouse effect.					; Liu, Defu/L-1307-2019	han, yanxing/0009-0006-9726-7423; 													2296-701X					JAN 5	2024	11								1297047	10.3389/fevo.2023.1297047	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2023.1297047													WOS:001145072300001

Six high-amplitude reflectors within the lacustrine drape can be correlated to periods of enhanced inter- and underflow deposition in sediment cores. Based on the synthesis of major environmental changes in the NW Alps and on the age-depth model covering the past 7500 years in Lake Le Bourget, periods of enhanced Rhone River flood events in the lake can be related to abrupt climate changes and/or to increasing land use since c. 2700 cal. yr BP. For example, significant land use under rather stable climate conditions during the Roman Empire may be responsible for large flood deposits in the northern part of Lake Le Bourget between AD 966 and 1093. However, during the Little Ice Age (LIA), well-documented major environmental changes in the catchment area essentially resulted from climate change and formed basin-wide major flood deposits in Lake Le Bourget. Up to five 'LIA-like' Holocene cold periods developing enhanced Rhone River flooding activity in Lake Le Bourget are documented at c. 7200, 5200, 2800, 1600 and 200 cal. yr BP. These abrupt climate changes were associated in the NW Alps with Mont Blanc glacier advances, enhanced glaciofluvial regimes and high lake levels. Correlations with European lake level fluctuations and winter precipitation regimes inferred from glacier fluctuations in western Norway suggest that these five Holocene cooling events at 45 degrees N were associated with enhanced westerlies, possibly resulting from a persistent negative mode of the North Atlantic Oscillation.					; Arnaud, Fabien/F-7003-2012; De Smet, Marc/E-2451-2013; Revel, Marie/C-2229-2015	Desmet, Marc/0009-0002-8970-4313; Arnaud, Fabien/0000-0002-8706-9902; 													0300-9483	1502-3885				NOV	2005	34	4					404	416		10.1080/03009480500231260	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03009480500231260													WOS:000233566000002

Over-all the incident has resulted in one of the worst, visibly apparent, manmade disasters of all time. Over 200 oil wells were exploded, approximately 60 million barrels of oil spewed onto the land to form over 300 oil lakes which covered a land area of 49 km(2), 40 million tons of soil became heavily contaminated, and vast areas became covered with aerial mist fall-out, the contaminants from which have migrated as much as 20 m in depth. Also over 6 million barrels of oil were pumped into the Gulf (exceeding by more than 40-50 fold, the oil pollution caused by the Valdez spill). These circumstances posed pollution threats to water sources, as well as plant, animal, fish, the terrestrial habitats of wildlife, the terrestrial habitats, and the coastal and atmospheric environments. This manuscript summarizes the integrated approaches that have been taken by the Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research to quantify the environmental damage, ascertain its significance, and adapt the technologies and approaches needed to resolve the complex integrated aspects of this disaster.																					0-9521673-3-6				1996							141	153																WOS:A1996BH90B00020

Retention potential for trihalomethane precursors in water from lake Izu falls in the range of 87 to 97%. As for the self-made NS-300 and 301 membranes, flux stays almost constant until the ratio of isophthaloyl chloride(IPC) to trimesoyl chloride (TMC) exceeds 50%, and then decreases and the retention takes a maximum value at 50% of the ratio. Using FT-30 membrane, reverse osmosis retention of chloroform decreased from 80% at the feed concentration of 250 ppm to 40% at 25 ppm. Two types of composite membranes made of a thin poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) on poly(acrylonitrile) (PAN) support and a thin poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) on polysulfone (PSf) were fabricated to find out the effect of molecular weight cut-off of the support on the characteristics of separation of water and ethanol by pervaporation. It was found that there is optimum molecular weight cut-off of the support regarding the separation.																			0258-0322					MAY	1993	70-1						341	349		10.1002/masy.19930700135	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/masy.19930700135													WOS:A1993LH24900034

Sensitivity of a hypersaline crater lake to the seasonality of rainfall, evaporation, and guano supply	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												The hypersaline crater lake and its catchment on seabird island Isabel (Pacific, off Mexico) was studied to explore the influence of strong seasonal variations in rainfall/evaporation and guano contribution on its limnology. The hypersaline lake water (HSW, 78 %) is up to 2.2-times enriched in inert ions relative to mean seawater. Rainfall during summer dilutes the HSW to form a less saline rainwater body (RWB) above a chemolimnion between 2 and 4 m water depth. The RWB is inhabited first by diatoms and ostracods followed later on by cyanobacteria and ciliates. Evaporation of > 1.5 m depth of lake water over the dry season increases the salinity of the RWB until the water column becomes isohaline at HSW concentrations in the late dry season. Differences in the stable isotope composition of water and primary producers in RWB and HSW reflect this development. Introduction of seabird guano and the decrease of salinity fuel a high primary production in the RWB with higher delta(CDIC)-C-13 and delta(13)Corg of particulate organic matter than in the HSW. The high N supply leads to high delta N-15 NH4 values (+ 39 % in the HSW) as the consequence of ammonia volatilization that is strongest during guano maturation and with evaporative salinity increase from the HSW. Precipitation of carbonate (calcite and aragonite) from the RWB and the HSW is hindered by the high concentration of guano-derived P. This inhibition may be overcome with evaporative supersaturation during particularly dry conditions. Carbonate may also precipitate during particularly wet conditions from the dilute RWB, where the P-concentration is reduced during an active phytoplankton production that raises the pH. Differences in the stable isotope signatures of carbon and oxygen in HSW and RWB (+ 5 % delta(CDIC)-C-13 and -3 % d18OH2O) suggest the processes of carbonate precipitation can be distinguished based on the isotope signature of the carbonates deposited. Changes in the lake system are indicated when lower temperatures and higher rainfall in the 2006 wet season introduced more and less mature guano to the lake. The lower pH was accompanied by lower ammonia volatilization and carbonate precipitation as indicated by an increased concentration of NH4, Ca, Sr and DIC, while delta H-2, delta(NNH4)-N-15, and salinity were lower. According to our results, the observed sediment laminations should reflect the introduction of catchment material (including guano) with runoff, the RWB plankton production, and the carbonate precipitation in relation to its origin and seasonality.

J	Stewart, AR				Stewart, AR			Accumulation of Cd by a freshwater mussel (Pyganodon grandis) is reduced in the presence of Cu, Zn, Pb, and Ni	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												The effects of a metal mixture on Cd bioavailability and uptake in the freshwater mussel Pyganodon grandis (formerly Anodonta grandis grandis) were investigated in a limnocorral experiment in a Precambrian Shield lake during the summer of 1992. Differences in the partitioning of Cd in water, sediment, and mussels were identified between limnocorrals treated with Cd alone or with Cd and a mixture of metals (Cu, Zn, Pb, and Ni) at three concentration levels. Loss of Cd from the water column was slower in treatments with the metal mixture (22- to 34-day half-life) than in the treatment with Cd alone (11-day half-life). Despite the higher concentrations of Cd in the water column in treatments with the mixture of metals, the mussels accumulated proportionally less Cd as the metal concentrations increased. These relationships were observed in mussels exposed for 40 days ([Cd] <4.4 mu g L-1) and 80 days ([Cd] = 4-14 mu gL(-1)). The uncoupling of the effects of the metal mixture on Cd bioavailability and uptake suggests that laboratory studies may be appropriate for characterizing metal uptake in mussels exposed to mixtures of metals under nonequilibrium conditions. The significant deviation in the behavior of Cd in the presence of the metal mixture emphasizes the need to further investigate regulatory approaches that focus on individual contaminants.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				MAR	1999	56	3					467	478		10.1139/cjfas-56-3-467	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-56-3-467													WOS:000081027800012

The depositional system evolved temporally, spatially, and episodically in five rifting stages (stages 1-5) during the Paleogene and Neogene, with sedimentation responding to regional subsidence. This study focuses on the tectono-sedimentary evolution through stages 2-4, while the main oil-bearing sedimentary rocks were deposited in the Bohai Bay Basin. The depositional system exhibited retrogradation and then progradation during the rifting stage 2 (43-36.7 Ma), retrogradation in stage 3 (36.7-32.8 Ma), and upward coarsening and progradation in stage 4 (32.8-24.6 Ma). This vertical superposition corresponded to three episodic stages of rising and falling lake levels during the Paleogene, which were equivalent to a transgressive with regressive (stage 2), transgressive (stage 3), and then regressive (stage 4) cycle. The sediment fills coincided with the tectonism and the regional subsidence history of the Qikou Sag, which is composed of uplift areas and sub-sags. In this respect, the boundary fault activity around the sub-sags decreased from stages 2-4, leading to the migration of sub-sag depocenters from near faults to the center of sub-sags, which suggests that faults released control over the sedimentation. Secondly, tectonism and the total subsidence rate decreased from SQ1 to SQ7 (stages 2-3) and then accelerated at the end of stage 4 (SQ10 to SQ11). The tectonic subsidence rates decreased quicker than the total subsidence rate; this demonstrates that major rift faulting was the dominant geological process in the early Paleogene, whereas overall subsidence was dominant in the late Paleogene.

(before present, 1950), the longest unbroken and non-floating lake varve sequence yet described. The underlying sediment is unvarved and hard. Changes in the aragonite/calcite ratio, the presence of protodolomite and magnesite in certain profile sections, the annual record of the sedimentation rate, the water content of the sediment, the concentrations of organic carbon and opal, and the texture of the sediments from this core provide a record of the lake level history. The new chronology enabled us to redate the old pollen profile [van Zeist and Woldring, 1978a, b] and to establish an accurate timescale for the reconstructed lake level change. Carbon 14 dates show that the highest lake terrace corresponds to high lake level at around 19,000 years B.P. during the Last Glacial, >70 m above its present level. Before 15,000 years B.P. the lake must have been completely dry, marking a reduction of lake level by 500 m in maximum 4000 years. Beginning at 14,600 years B.P. and ending at 12,040 years B.P., the lake level recovered by 250 m to fall again during the next 1400 years. By 10,600 years B.P. the lake began to rise and reached, following another regression between 9000 and 8100 years B.P., the Holocene highstand by about 7500 years B.P., dropping to today's level at about 3000 years B.P.

J	Holdaway, MR				Holdaway, MR			Spatial modeling and interpolation of monthly temperature using kriging	CLIMATE RESEARCH												Estimates of the climatic record at forest plot locations may be useful in studying how forests will respond to future climatic change. Kriging was applied to the spatial interpolation of monthly temperature records in the forested regions of Minnesota in the north central United States. Monthly empirical variograms, averaged over 90 yr, were modeled with Gaussian or linear models, and ordinary kriging was applied to interpolate the data. Anisotropies were found in the winter months, suggesting the presence of a large-scale regional trend. Structural analysis of mean monthly temperature revealed: (1) a broad regional component to the variation, changing systematically by month, which was estimated by a linear function of latitude and longitude and (2) a lake effect (due to Lake Superior) varying in strength and sign by month. A detrending approach was tested to remove these effects and a modified approach based on only the lake effect trend was also tested. The cross validation technique was used to test the 3 models. The lake effect trend model was judged best in accounting for the influence of Lake Superior on nearby land areas. The study demonstrated that moderate trends in the data do not seriously degrade the applicability of ordinary kriging to the interpolation of monthly temperature. A temporal analysis revealed that, although there have been systematic changes in the spatial variability over the last century, using century-averaged variograms is not expected to decrease the accuracy and precision of the interpolations.																			0936-577X					JUN 13	1996	6	3					215	225		10.3354/cr006215	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/cr006215													WOS:A1996VQ90400002

The sediments, which were hydrous and flocculent, were collected at or near the area of maximum depth in each lake with a diver-operated sampler that permitted in situ sectioning of a 1-m core. Mercury concentrations were greatest in the top 15 cm of the cores and were much lower in the deeper strata. The Hg content in the most enriched stratum of individual cores ranged from 0.09 to 0.24 .mu.g/g dry weight, whereas concentrations in deep, precolonial strata ranged from 0.04 to 0.07 .mu.g/g. Sediment enrichment factors varied from 0.8 to 2.8 and were not correlated with lake pH. The increase in the Hg content of recent sediments was attributed to increased atmospheric deposition of the metal. Eight of the 11 systems studied were low-alkalinity lakes that presumably received most (.gtoreq. 90%) of their hydrologic input from precipitation falling directly onto the lake surface. Thus, the sedimentary Hg in these lakes seems more likely linked to direct atmospheric deposition onto the lake surfaces than to influences from the watershed. The data imply that a potentially significant fraction of the high Hg burdens measured in game fish in certain lakes in north-central Wisconsin originated from atmospheric sources.																			0090-4341	1432-0703				JAN-APR	1989	18	1-2					175	181		10.1007/BF01056202	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01056202													WOS:A1989Q889300016

EPIC contains 10 narrow channels in the 317-780 nm solar spectral range. The data acquired with EPIC have already been used in a variety of scientific investigations, including the study of the global ozone levels, aerosol index and aerosol optical depth, UV reflectivity of clouds over land and ocean, cloud height over land and ocean, and vegetation indices. In this article, we report that EPIC data, particularly for the data measured with narrow channels centered near 443, 551, and 680 nm, can also have important applications in remote sensing of ocean color in different geographical regions. We have modified a version of a multi-channel atmospheric correction algorithm for Moderate Resolution Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MODIS) ocean color applications and adapted the algorithm for processing EPIC data. We present three case studies on water leaving reflectance retrievals from EPIC data acquired over a large turbid river, inland lakes, and oceans. We conclude that a future ocean color instrument on board a satellite at the L1 point, which provides continuous view of the full sunlit disk of the Earth, will complement and extend ocean color observations with the low Earth observing polar orbital and geostationary satellite instruments in both the spatial and time domains.

Shallow-urban lakes are particularly susceptible to receive pollutants from urban discharges and sediment resuspension. Lake Xochimilco, in Mexico City, an urban-shallow lake, faces multiple problems: urban sprawl, overexploitation of aquifers, drying of springs, discharge of wastewater from treatment plants, and sediment resuspension. The aquatic biota living in this ecosystem is continuously exposed to the release of pollutants from the sediments. We assessed the risk that pollutants released from sediments from Lake Xochimilco, Touristic (TZ) and Agriculture zone (AZ), can exert on a native amphibian species of the lake (Ambystoma mexicanum) through exposure bioassays to sediment elutriates. We evaluate alterations in the amphibian by three approaches: biochemical (level of lipid peroxidation, LPO), cellular (ultrastructure) and the liver histology of A. mexicanum and we compare them with a batch control. Additionally, we assessed heavy metals (Pb, Cd and Hg) in elutriates. Elutriates from TZ showed the highest concentrations of the metals assessed. Organisms exposed to sediment elutriates from either study sites showed higher LPO values than control organisms (p < 0.05). Organisms exposed to elutriates from the TZ showed the most conspicuous damages: hepatic vasodilation of sinusoids, capillaries with erythrocytes, leukocyte infiltration and cytoplasmic vacuolation in hepatocytes. The biological responses assessed reflected the risk that faces A. mexicanum when is exposed for prolonged periods to sediment resuspension in Lake Xochimilco.

J	Hildreth, W				Hildreth, W			Kulshan caldera: A Quaternary subglacial caldera in the north Cascades, Washington	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												Calderas that collapse during large pyroclastic eruptions are anomalously rare in the Cascade are. Recognition of the early Pleistocene 4.5 x 8 km Kulshan caldera, filled with rhyodacite ignimbrite at the northeast foot of Mount Baker, brings to only three the Quaternary calderas identified in the Cascades, A near-vertical ring fault cut in basement rocks of the North Cascades encloses 30 km(2) of intracaldera ignimbrite (and intermixed collapse breccia) >1 km thick but with no floor exposed, The Lake Tapps tephra in the Puget lowland is the correlative fallout; 200 km from the source, it is as thick as 30 cm. Features of the distal ash fall and the intracaldera tuff suggest large-scale phreatomagmatism during an eruption that may have started subglacially, Several advances of the Cordilleran ice sheet subsequently obliterated the topographic rim, removed every vestige of extracaldera ignimbrite and proximal fallout, and stripped any precaldera extrusive rocks-the former existence of which is suggested only by a few silicic intrusions that cut the circumcaldera basement, Although the caldera is not structurally resurgent, several early intracaldera rhyodacite lavas intrude and rest directly on ignimbrite or on ashy caldera-lake sediments reworked from the eruption products, Subsidence areas, pumice compositions, and volumes of magma erupted (>50 km(3)) are similar for the Kulshan, Rockland, and Crater Lake (Mazama events, the three Quaternary caldera-forming eruptions now recognized In the Cascades.																			0016-7606					JUL	1996	108	7					786	793		10.1130/0016-7606(1996)108<0786:KCAQSC>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/0016-7606(1996)108<0786:KCAQSC>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1996UX03900003

A Preliminary Case Study on the Compounding Effects of Local Emissions and Upstream Wildfires on Urban Air Pollution	FIRE-SWITZERLAND												Interactions between urban and wildfire pollution emissions are active areas of research, with numerous aircraft field campaigns and satellite analyses of wildfire pollution being conducted in recent years. Several studies have found that elevated ozone and particulate pollution levels are both generally associated with wildfire smoke in urban areas. We measured pollutant concentrations at two Utah Division of Air Quality regulatory air quality observation sites and a local hot spot (a COVID-19 testing site) within a 48 h period of increasing wildfire smoke impacts that occurred in Salt Lake City, UT (USA) between 20 and 22 August 2020. The wildfire plume, which passed through the study area during an elevated ozone period during the summer, resulted in increased criteria pollutant and greenhouse gas concentrations. Methane (CH4) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) increased at comparable rates, and increased NOx led to more ozone. The nitrogen oxide/ozone (NOx/O3) cycle was clearly demonstrated throughout the study period, with NOx titration reducing nighttime ozone. These findings help to illustrate how the compounding effects of urban emissions and exceptional pollution events, such as wildfires, may pose substantial health risks. This preliminary case study supports conducting an expanded, longer-term study on the interactions of variable intensity wildfire smoke plumes on urban air pollution exposure, in addition to the subsequent need to inform health and risk policy in these complex systems.

Lake Apopka is adjacent to an EPA Superfund site, listed due to an extensive spill of dicofol and DDT or its metabolites. These compounds can act as estrogens. Contaminants in the lake also have been derived from extensive agricultural activities around the lake that continue today and a sewage treatment facility associated with the city of Winter Garden, Florida. We examined the hypothesis that an estrogenic contaminant has caused the current failure in recruitment of alligators on Lake Apopka. Supporting data include the following: At 6 months of age, female alligators from Lake Apopka had plasma estradiol-17 beta concentrations almost two times greater than normal females from the control lake, Lake Woodruff. The Apopka females exhibited abnormal ovarian morphology with large numbers of polyovular follicles and polynuclear oocytes. Male juvenile alligators had significantly depressed plasma testosterone concentrations comparable to levels observed in normal Lake Woodruff females but more than three times lower than normal Lake Woodruff males. Additionally, males from Lake Apopka had poorly organized testes and abnormally small phalli. The differences between lakes and sexes in plasma hormone concentrations of juvenile alligators remain even after stimulation with luteinizing hormone. Our data suggest that the gonads of juveniles from Lake Apopka have been permanently modified in ovo, so that normal steroidogenesis is not possible, and thus normal sexual maturation is unlikely.																			0091-6765	1552-9924				AUG	1994	102	8					680	688		10.2307/3432198	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3432198								7895709					WOS:A1994PC37300012

Published data suggest at least two phylogroups: western (Ural Mountains and Western Siberia) and eastern (east from lake Baikal, including the Korean peninsula), but their phylogenetic relationship remains unclear. Combined sequences of cytochrome b (1140 bp) and the mtDNA control region (963 bp) were analyzed from 219 Siberian roe deer from 12 locations in Russia, Mongolia, and South Korea, which cover a large part of its range, to assess genetic diversity and phylogeographical status. Special emphasis was placed on the demographic history and genetic features of central, peripheral, and isolated populations. Results of median-joining network and phylogenetic tree analyses indicate that Siberian roe deer from the Urals to the Pacific Ocean are genetically diverse and that geographical distribution and composition of haplogroups coincide with previously described ranges of the subspecies Capreolus pygargus pygargus and Capreolus pygargus tianschanicus. We found that peripheral populations in the northwestern parts of the species range (Urals), as well as the isolated population from Jeju Island, are genetically distinct from those in the core part of the range, both in terms of genetic diversity and quantitative composition of haplogroups. We also found that northwestern (Urals) and northern (Yakutia) peripheral populations share the same haplogroup and fall into the same phylogenetic clade with the isolated population from Jeju Island. This finding sheds light on the taxonomic status of the Jeju Island population and leads to hypotheses about the discordance of morphological and genetic evolution in isolated populations and specific genetic features of peripheral populations.

JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY												Parasite host specificity has important implications for species diversity estimates, food web dynamics, and host shifts. "White grub'' is the metacercaria stage of a fluke (Posthodiplostomum minimum) that occurs in many fish species, but no attempt has been made to quantify variation in host use by this worm. Here we used 2 approaches to evaluate host specificity within the strain that infects centrarchids (P. minimum centrarchi). First, we measured parasite loads in 2 centrarchid hosts, bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) and white crappie (Pomoxis annularis), from Spring Lake in McDonough County, Illinois. We found that infection levels differed significantly between these hosts. Prevalence in bluegill was 100% and the median intensity was 940 metacercariae, but only 57% of white crappie were infected (median intensity = 4). Site specificity of white grub also differed significantly between the 2 hosts. In bluegills, kidneys were most heavily infected, whereas in white crappies, livers harbored the most worms. We also performed a literature survey of P. minimum prevalence estimates from 14 centrarchid species from other localities. We calculated the mean white grub prevalence for each host species and used this to calculate S-TD*, a quantitative index of host specificity. S-TD* was 1.33, significantly closer to the value for a specialist (S-TD* = 1.00) than a generalist (S-TD* = 2.00). This reflects the fact that P. minimum prevalence is higher in Lepomis species than it is in centrarchids outside this genus. These data show that P. minimum centrarchi specializes on Lepomis species, but the causes of this specialization are unknown. This worm may be a single species that differs in host use due to ecological or physiological host differences, or it may be a complex of species that vary in host use for similar reasons. Genetic data are required to evaluate these possibilities.																			0022-3395	1937-2345				FEB	2015	101	1					6	17		10.1645/14-584.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1645/14-584.1								25260116					WOS:000351562800002

Total photosynthesis (as consumption of carbon dioxide) was 37.5 mmole C m-2 d-1, 83% of which was benthic and macrophytic. By direct measurement benthic respiration exceeded benthic photosynthesis by 6.6 mmole C m-2 d-1. The lake lost 1.4 x 10(6) moles C in two weeks after ice melted by degassing CO2, and 6.8 mmole C m-2 d-1 (1.5 x 10(6) moles) during the remainder of the open water period; 2.2 mmole C m-2 d-1 of this was release of CO2 stored in the sediments by cryoconcentration the previous winter. Anaerobic microbial decomposition was only 4% of the benthic aerobic respiration rate of 38 mmole C m-2 d-1. An annual budget estimate for the lake indicated that 50% of the carbon was produced by the benthic community, 20% by phytoplankton, and 30% was allochthonous material. The relative contribution of allochthonous input was in accordance with measurement of the deltaN-15 of sedimented organic matter.																			0168-2563						1994	24	3					145	172																WOS:A1994NU08800003

In this context, a comprehensive metagenomic shotgun analysis was performed on a population of Dolichospermum lemmermannii collected during a surface bloom in Lake Garda in the summer of 2020. Using a phylogenomic approach, the almost complete metagenome-assembled genome obtained from the analysis allowed to clarify the taxonomic position of the species within the genus Dolichospermum and contributed to frame the taxonomy of this genus within the ADA group (Anabaena/Dolichospermum/Aphanizomenon). In addition to common functional traits represented in the central metabolism of photosynthetic cyanobacteria, the genome annotation uncovered some distinctive and adaptive traits that helped define the factors that promote and maintain bloom-forming heterocytous nitrogen-fixing Nostocales in oligotrophic lakes. In addition, genetic clusters were identified that potentially encode several secondary metabolites that were previously unknown in the populations evolving in the southern Alpine Lake district. These included geosmin, anabaenopetins, and other bioactive compounds. The results expanded the knowledge of the distinctive competitive traits that drive algal blooms and provided guidance for more targeted analyses of cyanobacterial metabolites with implications for human health and water resource use. The metagenomic analysis of Dolichospermum collected during a bloom allowed to clarify its taxonomic position within the Anabaena/Dolichospermum/Aphanizomenon (ADA) classification scheme, and to characterize the distinctive competitive traits that drive oligotrophic algal blooms.

Mesocosm evaluation of triclopyr on Eurasian watermilfoil and three native submersed species: The role of treatment timing and herbicide exposure	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC PLANT MANAGEMENT												Early-season recommendations to improve herbicide efficacy and selectivity when targeting Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum L.) have been adopted by many aquatic plant managers in the upper Midwest. To address the role of treatment timing and exposure, two mesocosm studies were conducted on plants established the prior fall to evaluate short- and long-term exposure scenarios when the auxin mimic herbicide triclopyr ([3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinyl)oxy]acetic acid) is used for selective control of Eurasian watermilfoil (EWM). The first study included liquid and granular triclopyr applied at 1.5 mg L-1 in late February and late April 2009 under high-water-exchange conditions (12-h half-life). The second trial included static liquid exposures for early March and late April 2011 treatments at use rates of 0.25, 0.5, and 1.5 mg L-1 and liquid and granular treatments at 1.5 mg L-1 under high-waterexchange conditions (5-h half-life). The second study also included the native species American pondweed (Potamogeton nodosus Poir.), Illinois pondweed (P. illinoensis Morong), and vallisneria (Vallisneria americana Michx.). In the first study, February triclopyr treatments with liquid and granular formulations did not reduce biomass compared to the untreated plants during a May harvest, whereas both April treatments resulted in complete control of EWM. Results of the second trial indicated that treatment timing (March vs. April) was not a significant factor for static treatments (0.25 to 1.5 mg L-1) and near 100% EWM control was achieved. In contrast, under high flow conditions, the March liquid treatment did not differ from the untreated reference plants. The granular treatment reduced EWM by 55% compared to the untreated reference, yet it still increased in biomass by 4-fold compared to the initial biomass. The April treatments were more effective than the March applications under conditions of high water exchange. The native plants evaluated were not impacted by treatment timing, rate, formulation, or exposure scenario. Results demonstrate early-season treatments were effective regardless of treatment timing under extended triclopyr exposure periods; however, in areas of high-water-exchange early treatments of EWM resulted in reduced plant control. Managers can use this information to determine if early- or later-season treatments are warranted based on the likely exposure scenario.

J	Oni, SK; Futter, MN; Teutschbein, C; Laudon, H				Oni, Stephen K.; Futter, Martyn N.; Teutschbein, Claudia; Laudon, Hjalmar			Cross-scale ensemble projections of dissolved organic carbon dynamics in boreal forest streams	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												Climate is an important driver of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) dynamics in boreal catchments characterized by networks of streams within forest-wetland landscape mosaics. In this paper, we assess how climate change may affect stream DOC concentrations ([DOC]) and export from boreal forest streams with a multi-model ensemble approach. First, we apply an ensemble of regional climate models (RCMs) to project soil temperatures and stream-flows. These data are then used to drive two biogeochemical models of surface water DOC: (1) The Integrated Catchment model for Carbon (INCA-C), a detailed process-based model of DOC operating at the catchment scale, and (2) The Riparian Integration Model (RIM), a simple dynamic hillslope scale model of stream [DOC]. All RCMs project a consistent increase in temperature and precipitation as well as a shift in spring runoff peaks from May to April. However, they present a considerable range of possible future runoff conditions with an ensemble median increase of 31 % between current and future (2061-2090) conditions. Both biogeochemical models perform well in describing the dynamics of present-day stream [DOC] and fluxes, but disagree in their future projections. Here, we assess possible futures in three boreal catchments representative of forest, mire and mixed landscape elements. INCA-C projects a wider range of stream [DOC] due to its temperature sensitivity, whereas RIM gives consistently larger inter-annual variation and a wider range of exports due to its sensitivity to hydrological variations. The uncertainties associated with modeling complex processes that control future DOC dynamics in boreal and temperate catchments are still the main limitation to our understanding of DOC mechanisms under changing climate conditions. Novel, currently overlooked or unknown drivers may appear that will present new challenges to modelling DOC in the future.					; Oni, Stephen/J-6748-2012; Teutschbein, Claudia/P-5504-2014; Futter, Martyn/G-6238-2011; Laudon, Hjalmar/J-3074-2013	Oni, Stephen/0000-0002-7345-9344; Teutschbein, Claudia/0000-0002-3344-2468; Futter, Martyn/0000-0002-9789-7138; Laudon, Hjalmar/0000-0001-6058-1466													0930-7575	1432-0894				MAY	2014	42	9-10					2305	2321		10.1007/s00382-014-2124-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-014-2124-6													WOS:000336983900004
J	Casati, B; Yagouti, A; Chaumont, D				Casati, Barbara; Yagouti, Abderrahmane; Chaumont, Diane			Regional Climate Projections of Extreme Heat Events in Nine Pilot Canadian Communities for Public Health Planning	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												Public health planning needs the support of evidence-based information on current and future climate, which could be used by health professionals and decision makers to better understand and respond to the health impacts of extreme heat. Climate models provide information regarding the expected increase in temperatures and extreme heat events with climate change and can help predict the severity of future health impacts, which can be used in the public health sector for the development of adaptation strategies to reduce heat-related morbidity and mortality. This study analyzes the evolution of extreme temperature indices specifically defined to characterize heat events associated with health risks, in the context of a changing climate. The analysis is performed by using temperature projections from the Canadian Regional Climate Model. A quantile-based statistical correction is applied to the projected temperatures, in order to reduce model biases and account for the representativeness error. Moreover, generalized Pareto distributions are used to extend the temperature distribution upper tails and extrapolate the statistical correction to extremes that are not observed in the present but that might occur in the future. The largest increase in extreme daytime temperatures occurs in southern Manitoba, Canada, where the already overly dry climate and lack of soil moisture can lead to an uncontrolled enhancement of hot extremes. The occurrence of warm nights and heat waves, on the other hand, is already large and will increase substantially in the communities of the Great Lakes region, characterized by a humid climate. Impact and adaptation studies need to account for the temperature variability due to local effects, since it can be considerably larger than the model natural variability.																			1558-8424	1558-8432				DEC	2013	52	12					2669	2698		10.1175/JAMC-D-12-0341.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JAMC-D-12-0341.1													WOS:000328349300005

A D-vine copula-based quantile regression towards merging satellite precipitation products over rugged topography: a case study in the upper Tekeze-Atbara Basin	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Precipitation is a vital key element in various studies of hydrology, flood prediction, drought monitoring, and water resource management. The main challenge in conducting studies over remote regions with rugged topography is that weather stations are usually scarce and unevenly distributed. However, open-source satellite-based precipitation products (SPPs) with a suitable resolution provide alternative options in these data-scarce regions, which are typically associated with high uncertainty. To reduce the uncertainty of individual satellite products, we have proposed a D-vine copula-based quantile regression (DVQR) model to merge multiple SPPs with rain gauges (RGs). The DVQR model was employed during the 2001-2017 summer monsoon seasons and compared with two other quantile regression methods based on the multivariate linear (MLQR) and the Bayesian model averaging (BMAQ) techniques, respectively, and with two traditional merging methods - the simple modeling average (SMA) and the one-outlier-removed average (OORA) - using descriptive and categorical statistics. Four SPPs have been considered in this study, namely, Tropical Applications of Meteorology using SATellite (TAMSAT v3.1), the Climate Prediction Center MORPHing Product Climate Data Record (CMORPH-CDR), Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG v06), and Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN-CDR). The bilinear (BIL) interpolation technique was applied to downscale SPPs from a coarse to a fine spatial resolution (1 km). The rugged-topography region of the upper Tekeze-Atbara Basin (UTAB) in Ethiopia was selected as the study area. The results indicate that the precipitation data estimates with the DVQR, MLQR, and BMAQ models and with traditional merging methods outperform the downscaled SPPs. Monthly evaluations reveal that all products perform better in July and September than in June and August due to precipitation variability. The DVQR, MLQR, and BMAQ models exhibit higher accuracy than the traditional merging methods over the UTAB.

The modern vegetation in the Baishanzu area is typical mixed subtropical evergreen broad-leaved, coniferous, and deciduous broad-leaved forest, with a vegetation combination sensitive to climate change. Higher resolution pollen records from the Shangyang Lake Wetland, located in the subtropical monsoon climate of the Baishanzu area in Zhejiang, China, were combined with environmental proxy data, such as data on loss on ignition and charcoal, to reconstruct the vegetation and climate changes since the Holocene. The results show that the climate was cool and dry during the early Holocene (11660-6580 cal. aBP), when the zonal vegetation changed from evergreen deciduous broad-leaved mixed forests dominated by evergreen Quercus (Quercus(E)), Castanopsis, deciduous Quercus (Quercus(D)), and Castanea to coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forests with rich Cryptomeria. Abies pollen spread to lower altitudes during the period 9620-8020 cal. aBP with Abies beshanzuensis covering large areas of land. The increased in the East Asian summer monsoon from 6580 to 2040 cal. aBP led to the Holocene Climate Optimum, when the climate was particularly warm and humid. The zonal vegetation was middle subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest dominated by Quercus(E), Castanopsis, and Cyclobalanopsis with particularly high forest coverage and few fire events. For the last 2000 years, coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forests, mainly Pinus taiwanensis, have dominated the vegetation in the area. Sharp increase in such flora was observed after the year 980. Decreased temperature, cold climate, and increased anthropogenic disturbances have resulted in a substantial reduction in the arboreal pollen content, including Quercus, Castanopsis, Castanea, and Ilex, and an increase in Pinus and Poaceae. The results of this study will play a positive role in fully understanding the historical background and internal mechanisms of subtropical forest changes.					li, xinke/JTU-3633-2023														0031-0182	1872-616X				DEC 15	2022	608								111293	10.1016/j.palaeo.2022.111293	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2022.111293		NOV 2022											WOS:000985489700001
J	BRADBURY, JP; WINTER, TC				BRADBURY, JP; WINTER, TC			AREAL DISTRIBUTION AND STRATIGRAPHY OF DIATOMS IN SEDIMENTS OF LAKE SALLIE, MINNESOTA	ECOLOGY												The patterns of modern diatom sedimentation in presently eutrophic Lake Sallie, Minnesota, USA, have aided in elucidating the trophic changes in the lake caused by man''s activities since the 1870s. The modern sedimentation patterns were determined from a transect of surface sediment samples taken through littoral and profundal zones of the lake and the trophic history is interpreted from the diatom content of 2 lake-sediment cores. The transect shows that, in this lake, diatom valves are mostly deposited in the area of their living habitats and are not homogeneously redistributed by lake currents. Planktonic diatoms Stephanodiscus sp. cf. S. hantzschii, S. niagarae and Melosira granulata dominate in the profundal sediments, and sessile Fragilaria spp. characterize the sediments beneath the littoral habitat. F. construens var. binodis prefers nutrient-rich water entering the littoral zone near the inflow of the Pelican River, a stream carrying secondary sewage effluent from the town of Detroit Lakes. The diatom stratigraphy indicates that the benthic and planktonic diatom communities have changed in species composition and probably in productivity as a result of cultural eutrophication. Spring-blooming Stephanodiscus sp. cf. S. hantzschii dominates the post-settlement record. A core near the Pelican River inflow shows a marked increase in F. construens var. binodis that probably reflects increased nutrient levels during the most recent history of Lake Sallie.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1976	57	5					1005	1014		10.2307/1941065	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1941065													WOS:A1976CN46200015

Here, a novel remote sensing strategy (the SCPOC algorithm) was developed to determine total POC concentrations, as well as terrestrial and endogenous POC concentrations in lakes. This strategy provides a successful example for the combination of isotope tracer and remote sensing technology. First, we obtained the terrestrial and endogenous POC concentration at the sampling point based on isotope tracing technology. Afterwards, we established a relationship between the phytoplankton absorption coefficient and the endogenous POC concentration (C-end), and applied a semi-analytical algorithm to invert the C-end value. Finally, the POC source ratio model and C(e)n(d) value were combined to obtain the POC concentration (C-POC) and terrestrial POC (C-ter). The results of synchronisation verification based on ocean and land colour instrument (OLCI) images show that the SCPOC algorithm has high C-end, C-ter, and C-POC inversion accuracy, with MAPE values of 26.07%, 30.43%, and 42.28%, respectively. In fact, the SCPOC algorithm not only improved the accuracy of lake POCmapping, but also fills the gap of optical retrieval of POC endmember concentrations. Additionally, data from the OLCI images indicated that the studied lakes were dominated by external POC. However, because of the greater contribution of algal blooms to POC, this dominant advantage weakens in summer, although the terrestrial organic carbon carried by rainfall runoff also affects lake POC composition. Different POC sources have different ecological roles in lakes, and the superior POC end-element estimation capability of the SCPOC algorithmcan not only be used as a supplement to traditional tracing methods, but also provides accurate spatial data for lake management.

ANC was estimated both traditionally (ANC(trad)) and modified by treating one-third of the dissolved organic matter as part of the strong acid anions (ANC(mod)). The threshold value to avoid fish damage (ANC(limit)) was compared with that found in a similar study from 1986. Brown trout populations were categorized as unaffected, damaged or extinct on the basis of questionnaires. In 1995, threshold values to avoid fish damage on the basis of ANC(trad) and ANC(mod) were 67 and 48 mu eq l(-1), respectively, compared with 20 and 8 mu eq l(-1), respectively, in 1986. The higher ANC(limit) found for the data from 1995 is probably caused by a lower pH and a higher inorganic Al concentration at a given ANC value in 1995 than in the 1980s. ANC(limit) was highly related to organic carbon concentrations in the study lakes, being estimated at 33, 73 and > 100 mu eq l(-1) for three different TOC categories (< 2 mg C l(-1), 2-5 mg C l(-1) and > 5 mg C l(-1)). These differences in ANC(limit) are due to lower pH and higher concentrations of inorganic Al in humic lakes than in clear water lakes at the same level of ANC. It is suggested that the change in ANC(limit) for fish in acidified lakes is linked to increased concentrations of TOC in recent years.																			1386-2588					JUN	2008	42	2					307	316		10.1007/s10452-008-9191-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-008-9191-x													WOS:000255997700011

Although comammox bacteria have been found in many ecosystems in recent years, there is still a lack of research on the comammox process in rhizosphere of emergent macrophytes in lakeshore zone. Sediment samples were collected in this study from rhizosphere, far-rhizosphere, and non-rhizosphere of emergent macrophytes along the shore of Lake Liangzi, a shallow lake. The diversity of comammox bacteria and amoA gene abundance of comammox bacteria, ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) in these samples were measured. The results showed that comammox bacteria widely existed in the rhizosphere of emergent macrophytes and fell into clade A.1, clade A.2, and clade B, and clade A was the predominant community in all sampling sites. The abundance of comammox amoA gene (6.52 x 106-2.45 x 108 copies g-1 dry sediment) was higher than that of AOB amoA gene (6.58 x 104-3.58 x 106 copies g-1 dry sediment), and four orders of magnitude higher than that of AOA amoA gene (7.24 x 102-6.89 x 103 copies g-1 dry sediment), suggesting that the rhizosphere of emergent macrophytes is more favorable for the growth of comammox bacteria than that of AOB and AOA. Our study indicated that the comammox bacteria may play important roles in ammonia-oxidizing processes in all different rhizosphere regions.

It is an important means of curbing the current severe water-environment situation. However, the policy impact of the RCS is still inconclusive in the existing literature. Using monthly data spanning from January 2015 to March 2022 from 25 water quality monitoring stations in rivers flowing into the sea across 13 prefecture-level cities in Guangdong Province, this study adopted regression discontinuity to evaluate the policy effects of the RCS on water quality. The results show that after the RCS's full implementation in Guangdong Province, the concentrations of dissolved oxygen (DO) increased and water quality indicators, such as permanganate index (CODMn), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and total phosphorus (TP), decreased; NH3-N showed the largest decrease. These findings indicate that the RCS may contribute to a measurable improvement in reducing water pollution. However, no statistically significant changes in pH and total nitrogen (TN) were found, which indicates that the RCS fell short of achieving the policy effect of comprehensive water-pollution control. Therefore, in order to improve the RCS, it is necessary to refine the existing water-quality assessment indicators and to establish an evaluation system centered on the ecological health of rivers and lakes. Additionally, a paradigm shift from an administrative-boundary-based river management model to an overarching, holistic river-basin-based management approach is crucial for actualizing the holistic governance goals of the RCS.

J	Squires, MM; Lesack, LFW; Huebert, D				Squires, MM; Lesack, LFW; Huebert, D			The influence of water transparency on the distribution and abundance of macrophytes among lakes of the Mackenzie Delta, Western Canadian Arctic	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Macrophyte abundance and distribution was assessed in a chain of six interconnected lakes (all with the same flooding frequency) in the Arctic, where increasing distance from the Mackenzie River channel resulted in a gradient of water transparency ('chain-set' lakes), and in a group of 26 spatially discrete lakes where increasing frequency and duration of lake flooding with river water (controlled by sill height) also resulted in a transparency gradient ('sill-set' lakes). 2. Among the chain-set lakes, above-ground macrophyte biomass increased from 0 to 1000 g m(-2) with increasing water transparency. Among the sill-set lakes, the transparency gradient among the lakes was less well defined and the relations with biomass were more varied. A decrease in flooding was associated with increasing water transparency and an increasing biomass of macrophytes from about 0 to over 2000 g m(-2). For a specific flood frequency, however, the effect of flooding was much greater when lakes were directly connected to a river channel than when floodwaters flowed first through an intervening lake. Among infrequently flooded lakes the effect of flooding on water transparency and biomass was negligible. 3. Among relatively clear lakes in both sets of lakes, biomass increased with increasing water transparency and decreasing lake depth. Among relatively turbid lakes, however, biomass increased with the combined effect of increasing water colour (decreasing water transparency) and increasing lake water depth. The increases in biomass with increasing water colour (coloured dissolved organic matter) and increasing depth, which together result in reduced light at the bed, may be explained by reduced exposure to ultra violet light. 4. An average light attenuation of 1.3 m(-1) (Secchi depth about 1 m) over the growing season appears to represent a threshold water transparency which, in combination with water depths early in the growing season, is consistent with a light supply on the bed required for growth of the common macrophytes in lakes of the Mackenzie Delta. However, a comparison with other systems indicates that macrophytes among lakes of the Mackenzie Delta grow deeper, for a given level of transparency, than is reported in lakes at lower latitude, despite the lower sun angles and increased reflectivity of water surfaces in the arctic. 5. A complete accounting of water transparency (at PAR and UV wavelengths), lake depth, summer sun angle and duration of sunlight may be necessary to explain patterns of macrophyte growth among lakes across a full range of latitudes.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				NOV	2002	47	11					2123	2135		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2002.00959.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2002.00959.x													WOS:000178848300008

In the spring of 2007, two families of cracks were observed on both banks of the lake, located near the barrage separating it from the downstream Batana Lake. A sinkhole was also detected. This raised great community alarm, since it was feared that the barrage would collapse. A geoelectric and geotechnical survey was carried out to monitor the crack aperture, the barrage movements and the evolution of the lake water level. On the basis of the information obtained, a model was designed that was able to offer a simple and consistent explanation of the system's behaviour. Therefore, the model was used as a basis to define the safety assessment system proposed here. The system is based on the data from previously installed monitoring devices that would be processed daily by the Technical Staff of the Park In the event that a warning should be triggered, an integrated analysis of all the information must be conducted, and an alert would be activated. The alert level will depend on how reliable the mobilisation hypothesis is, and different degrees of restricted access to Santos Morcillo, Batana and Colgada Lakes will take effect.

Carbon fixation rates were obtained from C-14 incubations. In general, production rates determined using the H,H-2(18)-spike were about twice the primary production determined by the C-14 method, where the latter was close to net oxygen evolution. These relationships are similar to results for the open ocean. During the spring bloom, when the dinoflagellate Peridinium was abundant, the ratio of gross O-2 production to carbon fixation was about 7.5, and net O-2 production was greater than carbon fixation. The difference between O-2 gross production and carbon fixation results, at least in part, from uptake by Mehler reaction and from recycling of the C-14 tracer by dark respiration and the alternative oxidase (AOX). We used the difference in isotopic discrimination against O-18, occurring during O-2 consumption by various biological pathways, to place constraints on the relative engagement of these pathways. We estimated the overall discrimination against O-18 in the lake from O-2 isotopic mass balance as 20.5-29parts per thousand. The only mechanism that can explain the strong overall fractionation in the lake is AOX, which strongly discriminates against O-18 (similar to31parts per thousand). Our results show, for the first time, that uptake by AOX is widespread and quantitatively important to oxygen consumption in aquatic systems.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	2002	47	1					33	42		10.4319/lo.2002.47.1.0033	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2002.47.1.0033													WOS:000173529200004

We contrasted the feeding behavior of Micropterus salmoides (Lacepede) (Centrarchidae) and Cichla ocellaris (Block and Schneider) (Cichlidae), both large-mouthed piscivores with a locomotor morphology designed for fast acceleration, with Lepomis spp. (Centrarchidae) and Cichlosoma severum (Heckel) (Cichlidae), both small-mouthed predators on benthic invertebrates with a locomotor morphology designed for maneuverability. Pressure profiles in the buccal and opercular cavities were more similar for species that shared ecomorphological patterns than for species that shared phylogenetic histories. For small-mouthed predators, minimum buccal pressures were significantly greater and occurred earlier than the corresponding opercular pressures. For both large-mouthed predators, minimum buccal and opercular pressures were similar in magnitude and in timing. We developed the ram-suction index (RSI) to identify the relative contributions of ram feeding (i.e. predator movement) and of suction feeding (i.e. prey movement) to shortening the predator-prey distance during the strike. The RSI values for small-mouthed predators fell closer to the suction end of the ram-suction continuum than did strikes by the large-mouthed predators. The RSI provides a bench mark for evaluating the hydrodynamic consequences of intraspecific, interspecific and interprey variation in strike mechanics.																			0022-0949					MAR	1993	176						11	29																WOS:A1993KV68100002
J	HECKY, RE				HECKY, RE			THERMAL AND OPTICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF SOUTHERN INDIAN LAKE BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER IMPOUNDMENT AND CHURCHILL RIVER DIVERSION	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												In 1976 Southern Indian Lake, a large, shallow, multibasin lake on the Churchill River in northern Manitoba, was impounded. The mean annual water level was raised 3 m over the historic mean level to divert 875 m3 .cntdot. s-1 by gravity flow from the lake into the Nelson River drainage. Five years of observation beginning 2 yr before the year of impoundment and continuing for 2 yr after impoundment indicate that lake temperatures, light available for photosynthesis, and Secchi disk transparencies have all declined. Increased mean depths, loss of riverine heat input because of diversion, and radiative losses because of backscattering from increased concentrations of suspended solids have caused a significant 1.degree.-2.degree. C cooling of the different basins of the lake and increased the natural south to north temperature gradient during the lake''s heating period. Winter temperatures also decreased significantly in South Bay, the point of diversion, because of increased inflow from a cooler region. Increases in light scattering caused by higher concentrations of suspended solids derived from shoreline erosion accounted for the most significant changes in vertical extinction coefficients and Secchi disk depths. Increased extinction of light and increased mean depth significantly reduced the mean water column light intensity of the mixed layer. These changes in the thermal and optical characteristics after impoundment occurred concurrently with significant changes in the impoundment''s biological communities.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1984	41	4					579	590		10.1139/f84-071	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f84-071													WOS:A1984SU52800004
J	WHITLOCK, C				WHITLOCK, C			POSTGLACIAL VEGETATION AND CLIMATE OF GRAND-TETON AND SOUTHERN-YELLOWSTONE-NATIONAL-PARKS	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												Pollen records from northern Grand Teton National Park, the Pinyon Peak Highlands, and southern Yellowstone National Park were examined to study the pattern of reforestation and climatic change following late-Pinedale Glaciation. The vegetational reconstruction was aided by analyses of associated plant macrofossils and the modem pollen rain of the region. Radiocarbon-age determinations and tephrochronology provided a chronologic framework to help correlate pollen records among sites. The fossil records indicate that alpine meadow communities, with Betula and Juniperus, were present between almost-equal-to 14 000 and almost-equal-to 11 500 yr BP. This early assemblage implies a lowering of modem upper treeline by at least 600 m and a climate that was almost-equal-to 5-6-degrees-C colder than present. Between 11 500 and 10 500 yr BP, increased temperature and winter precipitation allowed first Picea, and then Abies and Pinus cf. albicaulis to spread into areas underlain by andesite and nonvolcanic bedrock. By 10 500 yr BP, the fossil record in these areas resembled modem spectra from subalpine forest. In contrast, the Central Plateau of Yellowstone, which is underlain by infertile rhyolitic soils, was treeless prior to almost-equal-to 10 000 yr BP. The absence of late-glacial subalpine parkland in this area is attributed to the same edaphic factors that limit Picea, Abies, and Pinus albicaulis from the rhyolite plateau today. Between 10 000 and 9500 yr BP, Pinus contorta forest developed throughout the region in response to further warming. Pseudotsuga and Populus were present between 9500 and 5000 yr BP, suggesting a warmer, drier climate than today and more frequent fires. In the last 5000 yr BP mixed forests of Picea, Pinus, and Abies have developed on andesitic and nonvolcanic terrain, and closed forests of Pinus contorta have persisted on rhyolitic substrates. The vegetational patterns are attributed to a combination of climatic and nonclimatic controls operating on different spatial and temporal scales. Climatic changes brought about by the retreat of Laurentide ice and the amplification of the seasonal cycle of radiation explain the broad patterns of vegetational change on millennial time scales. On shorter time scales and smaller spatial scales, substrate differences and migration history shaped the vegetational variability.																			0012-9615	1557-7015				MAY	1993	63	2					173	198		10.2307/2937179	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2937179													WOS:A1993MN18700004

The oil is then pumped to the surface through the same well bore in which the steam is delivered (the production phase). The process is termed "cyclic stream stimulation." During the winter of 1995 a series of six well casings under stream failed and released approximately 55,000 cubic meters of material to the environment. The material was a mixture of oil, saline produced water, and solids, including shale, glacial till, sand, and clay. The failures occurred at various depths from 95 to 250 meters below ground and traveled upward to the surface. The spill affected two local groundwater aquifers. This paper describes the Cold Lake heavy oil production process, and then the chronology of events that resulted in the T-pad casing failure incident. Impact assessment methods, including surface geophysics, piezometer will installation, groundwater quality data collection, and contaminant fate and effects modeling, are presented, as well as remediation techniques. Much was learned from the T-pad incident regarding oil contamination within the groundwater aquifer systems.																									1997							357	363																WOS:000073241400052
J	McCrimmon, GG; Arnott, RWC				McCrimmon, GG; Arnott, RWC			The Clearwater Formation, Cold Lake, Alberta: a worldclass hydrocarbon reservoir hosted in a complex succession of tide-dominated deltaic deposits	BULLETIN OF CANADIAN PETROLEUM GEOLOGY												The Lower Cretaceous (Lower Albian) Clearwater Formation at Cold Lake, Alberta is a complex assemblage of nonmarine, marginal marine and shallow marine strata. Within the study area, these strata form four unconformity-bounded depositional sequences that in most cases consists of a lower progradational unit overlain by a retrogradational unit. The base of all sequences, except the first, is marked locally by a deeply incised, northwest-south-trending paleovalley. Although eroded during a fall of relative sea level, each paleovalley was filled mostly with sediment deposited by a northwest-prograding tide-dominated delta during each subsequent rise of relative sea level. Reservoir strata occur in the lower, deltaic part of the three youngest sequences, and consist primarily of nonmarine fluvial and high-energy tidal sand flats deposits. Deltaic progradation was halted, however, by a possible decrease in sediment flux and a return to retrogressive conditions. This formed an areally extensive flooding surface, which then was overlain by retrogradational shallow-marine deposits (embayment-mouth deposits). Accordingly, each sequence represents a short-term (4th order?) fluctuation of relative sea level that was superimposed on a long-term (3rd order?) rise of relative sea level. In addition, each successive sequence indicates a progressively more basinward migration of (tide-dominated) deltaic facies (prograding sequence set) suggestive of temporal changes in some number of local and/or regional sedimentary controls, such as sediment flux, rates of relative sea level, or depositional gradient.																			0007-4802					SEP	2002	50	3					370	392		10.2113/50.3.370	http://dx.doi.org/10.2113/50.3.370													WOS:000180898900002

Nanotechnology-based techniques were employed to periodically measure the ultra-sensitive SERS molecular characteristics of the raw water-bearing microbial community and the inorganic content. Employing the Pearson correlation coefficient revealed a robust linear relationship between electrical conductivity and pH and Raman and SERS spectral data of water samples, highlighting the interplay complexity of Raman/SERS signals and physicochemical parameters within each lake. The SERS data obtained from raw waters with AgNPs exhibited a dominant, reproducible SERS feature resembling adsorbed beta-carotene at submicromole concentration, which could be related to the cyanobacteria-AgNPs interface and supported by TEM analyses. Notably, spurious SERS sampling cases showed molecular traces attributed to additional metabolites, suggesting multiplexed SERS signatures. The conducted PCA demonstrated observable differences in the beta-carotene SERS band intensities between the two lakes, signifying potential variations in picoplankton abundance and composition or environmental influences. Moreover, the study examined variations in the SERS intensity ratio I245/I1512, related to the balance between inorganic (Cl--induced AgNPs aggregation) and organic (cyanobacteria population) balance, in correlation with the electrical conductivity. These findings signify the potential of SERS data for monitoring variations in microorganism concentration, clearly dependent on ion concentration and nutrient dynamics in raw, hypersaline water bodies.					; Cinta Pinzaru, Simona/HNQ-2311-2023; Müller Molnár, Csilla/R-6831-2019; Barbu-Tudoran, Lucian/B-7352-2011	Molnar, Csilla/0000-0002-2677-3509; Curean, Victor/0009-0007-4477-9318; Barbu-Tudoran, Lucian/0000-0003-0360-016X														2079-6374				JAN	2024	14	1							19	10.3390/bios14010019	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/bios14010019								38248396					WOS:001149523900001

A 5000-year lacustrine sediment oxygen isotope record of late Holocene climate change in Newfoundland, Canada	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The spatiotemporal patterns and underlying causes of climate variations spanning the mid-to late-Holocene in the North Atlantic region are largely unsettled. Here, we present a decadally resolved carbonate oxygen isotope (delta O-18) record spanning the last similar to 5000 calibrated years before present (cal yr BP) from Norman's Pond, a small, hydrologically open lake located in west-central Newfoundland, Canada. Stable isotope data from regional lakes, rivers, and precipitation samples indicate the delta O-18 record primarily reflects changes in the integrated, annual delta O-18 of precipitation, which is largely controlled by local atmospheric temperature and to a lesser extent, changes in the seasonality of precipitation. The record exhibits a general trend of decreasing delta O-18 values over the last -5000 cal yr BP that is consistent with gradually declining Boreal summer insolation and long-term cooling. Large decadal to centennial timescale fluctuations in delta O-18 values occurred during the last millennium, with persistent low delta O-18 values during the early Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA, 950 to 1250 CE) and more variable and low values across the Little Ice Age (LIA, 1450 to 1850 CE). Relatively low delta O-18 values during the early MCA at similar to 950 cal yr BP (1000 CE) suggest colder temperatures in Newfoundland and/or an increase in coldseason or decrease in warm-season precipitation across the island. MCA delta O-18 values are lower than those of the LIA, revealing that climate conditions in Newfoundland were variable and differed from the broader North Atlantic region. For example, the shift to very low delta O-18 during the early MCA is coincident with a transition to colder sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the Labrador Sea region, which was potentially triggered by melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet and alpine glaciers and ice caps in/around Baffin Bay, and subsequent delivery of cold waters further south via the Labrador Current. The early MCA interval of inferred cooling is coincident with Norse settlement at L'Anse aux Meadows in northern Newfoundland at similar to 929 cal yr BP (similar to 1021 CE). Subsequent low and variable 8 18 0 during the LIA suggests regional shifts in the seasonality of precipitation and/or cooling, consistent with other terrestrial climate records from the region. Proxy evidence from Norman's Pond therefore reinforces the idea of substantial spatiotemporal variability in climatic change in the broader North Atlantic region since at least the mid-Holocene, and in particular during the MCA, when cooler conditions prevailed in Newfoundland as a result of lower offshore sea surface temperatures that were likely driven by greater meltwater delivery via the Labrador current.

J	KEARNEY, MS; LUCKMAN, BH				KEARNEY, MS; LUCKMAN, BH			A MIDHOLOCENE VEGETATIONAL AND CLIMATIC RECORD FROM THE SUB-ALPINE ZONE OF THE MALIGNE VALLEY, JASPER-NATIONAL-PARK, ALBERTA (CANADA)	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Pollen, macrofossils and isotopic data (13C, 18O) from gastropod shells are used to reconstruct Holocene vegetational and climatic changes for a lower subalpine forest site (elevation 1690 m) in the Maligne Valley, Jasper National Park, Alberta. Subalpine forest has characterized the site since the inception of the sedimentary record in this small pond ca. 8500 yr B.P. In contrast to the vertical timberline fluctuations recorded at nearby sites above present tree-line, vegetational changes at the site appear to have been mainly horizontal, i.e., forest cover and tree density expanded or contracted laterally in response to climatic warming or cooling. At Maligne Lake forest cover was probably at its maximum extent about 7500 yr B.P., when Pseudotsuga and other montane elements had migrated to this elevation but did not displace the existing vegetation. The modern mosaic of discontinuous subalpine forest and extensive dwarf birch-dominated damp meadows and fens emerged only during the last 1300 years. A warmer Neoglacial episode, dated ca. 2600-3400 yr B.P., is indicated by increases in the temperature-limited gastropod, Lymnaea palustris, and by progressive enrichment in the 18O and 13C contents of their shells. Summer temperatures during this period, which has been tentatively identified elsewhere in the Canadian Rockies, may have risen by as much as 1.8.degree.

TIMING AND EXTENT OF LATE PLEISTOCENE GLACIATION IN THE ARID CENTRAL ANDES OF ARGENTINA AND CHILE (22°-41°S)	CUADERNOS DE INVESTIGACION GEOGRAFICA												The arid Central Andes are a key site to study changes in intensity and movement of the three main atmospheric circulation systems over South America: the South American Summer Monsoon (SASM), the Westerlies and the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). In this semi-arid to arid region glaciers are particularly sensitive to precipitation changes and thus the timing of past glaciation is strongly linked to changes in moisture supply. Surface exposure ages from study sites between 41 degrees and 22 degrees S suggest that glaciers advanced: i) prior to the global Last Glacial Maximum (gLGM) at similar to 40 ka in the mid (26 degrees-30 degrees S) and southern Central Andes (35 degrees-41 degrees S), ii) in phase with the gLGM in the northern and southern Central Andes and iii) during the late-glacial in the northern Central Andes. Deglaciation started synchronous with the global rise in atmospheric CO2 concentration and increasing temperature starting at similar to 18 ka. The pre-gLGM glacial advances likely document enhanced precipitation related to the Southern Westerlies, which shifted further to the North at that time than previosuly assumed. During the gLGM glacial advances were favored by decreased temperatures in combination with increased humidity due to a southward shifted Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and SASM. During the late-glacial a substantial increase in moisture can be explained by enhanced upper tropospheric easterlies as response to an intensified SASM and sustained La Nina-like conditions over the eastern equatorial Pacific that lead to glacial advances in the northern Central Andes and the lake level highstand Tauca (18-14 ka) on the Altiplano. In the southernmost Central Andes at 39 degrees-41 degrees S, further north at 31 degrees S and in the northernmost Central Andes at 22 degrees S glacial remnants even point to precipitation driven glaciations older than similar to 115 ka and 260 ka.

Sand aggradation alters biofilm standing crop and metabolism in a low-gradient Lake Superior tributary	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Sediment deposition changes the physical characteristics of river beds, and may alter the production and/or processing of allochthonous and autochthonous organic matter, with potential consequences for stream food webs. We conducted a comparative study of biofilm standing crop and metabolism in the Salmon Trout River, a tributary of Lake Superior where watershed disturbances have led to 3-fold increases in streambed fine sediments, predominately sand, in the past decade. We compared biofilm standing crop and metabolism rates using light-dark chambers in reaches where substrate consisted of predominately exposed rock or sand substrates. Biofilm chlorophyll a was 4.2-fold greater on rock substrates, but ash-free dry mass was 8-fold greater on sand substrates. Rates of gross primary production were 2 to 25-fold greater on rock versus sand substrates, and differences persisted whether rates were scaled for area or biofilm standing crop. In contrast, rates of respiration were similar on rock and sand substrates when scaled per unit area but 7-13 times lower on sand when scaled for biofilm standing crop. Together, these results suggest that sand aggradation in this river alters organic matter processing during the summer from net production to net consumption and storage of organic matter. Sand aggradation may alter the availability and processing of both allochthonous and autochthonous food resources in this forested river, with potential far-reaching impacts on the food web.

J	Sapone, A; Canistro, D; Vivarelli, F; Paolini, M				Sapone, Andrea; Canistro, Donatella; Vivarelli, Fabio; Paolini, Moreno			Perturbation of xenobiotic metabolism in Dreissena polymorpha model exposed in situ to surface water (Lake Trasimene) purified with various disinfectants	CHEMOSPHERE												Sanitation is of crucial importance for the microbiological safety of drinking water. However, chlorination of water rich in organic material produces disinfection by-products (DBPs), many of which have been reported to be mutagenic and/or carcinogenic compounds such as haloacetic acids and trihalomethanes. Epidemiological studies have suggested a link between drinking water consumption and cancer. We previously observed that Cyprinus carpio fish exposed to DBPs, may be subject to epigenetic effects such as those referable to the up-regulation of cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily (ex. co-mutagenesis/co-carcinogenesis and oxidative stress) that has been associated to non-genotoxic carcinogenesis. Our goal was to study the xenobiotic metabolism in mollusks exposed in situ to surface water of Lake Trasimene (Central Italy) treated with several disinfectants such as the traditional chlorine dioxide (ClO2), sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) or the relatively new one peracetic acid (PM). The freshwater bivalves (Dreissena polymorpha) being selected as biomarker, have the unique ability to accumulate pollutants. Freshwater bivalves were maintained in surface water containing each disinfectant individually (1-2 mg/L). Following an exposure period up to 20 days during the fall period, microsomes were collected from the mussels, then tested for various monooxygenases. Strong CYP inductions were observed. These data indicate that drinking water disinfection generates harmful DBP mixtures capable of determining a marked perturbation of CYP-supported reactions. This phenomenon, being associated to an increased pro-carcinogen bioactivation and persistent oxidative stress, could provide an explanation for the observational studies connecting the regular consumption of drinking water to increased risk of various cancers in humans.

Novel Phylogeographic Patterns in a Lowland Fish, Etheostoma proeliare (Percidae)	SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST												Etheostoma proeliare is distributed in the Gulf Coastal Plain of southeastern North America from the Colorado River of eastern Texas through the Choctawhatchee River of eastern Alabama, north to the Fall Line, and upstream along the Arkansas River valley into eastern Oklahoma. Parsimony and Bayesian analysis of the ND2 gene from 28 populations recovered a monophyletic E. proeliare (PP:1.0) containing a basal split between a novel clade of populations in the northern apex of the Mississippi embayment, from the Black and St. Francis rivers to the west of, through the Yazoo River to the east of, the main channel of the Mississippi River, and all other populations (PB:99, PP:1.0). Southern populations are resolved into three clades:Trinity plus Neches Rivers (PB:100, PP:1.0), Sabine River east through western tributaries to the Mississippi River plus the Lake Pontchartrain drainage (PP:1.0), and eastern tributaries to the Mississippi River east through the Escambia River (PP:0.99). The eastern clade is further divided into Pearl plus Big Black rivers (PB:97, PP:1.0) and Mobile Basin plus Escambia River clades (PP:0.98). These results indicate that although the mainstem of the Mississippi River corresponds to some phylogeographic breaks in a lowland species, it is not an absolute barrier. Future studies of species in the region should further explore the placement of Lake Pontchartrain populations and the existence of divergent populations in the northern Gulf Coastal Plain.																			1528-7092	1938-5412				MAR	2011	10	1					133	144		10.1656/058.010.0111	http://dx.doi.org/10.1656/058.010.0111													WOS:000306600900011

A.; Kolesnikov, S., I			Number of Pelicans (Pelecanidae) Breeding on the Territory of the Rostovsky Reserve and Causes of Abundance Variation	ARID ECOSYSTEMS												The number and distribution of nesting sites of the white pelican (Pelecanus onocrotalus Linnaeus, 1758) and Dalmatian pelican (Pelecanus crispus Bruch, 1832) in the Rostovsky Reserve from the moment of its establishment (1995) to the present time have been estimated. In this area, the Dalmatian pelican is a rare, regularly breeding species, while the white pelican is very rare species that occasionally breeds. Both species nest mainly on the islands of Lake Manych-Gudilo, rarely on large ponds with coarse, above-water vegetation with multispecies colonies of semiaquatic and waterfowl species. The Dalmatian pelican arrives early in the spring (in March) and usually forms small groups. The white pelican appears later (in April), when the scarce nesting sites are already occupied by other bird species (cormorants, gulls, etc.). In addition, it often forms large colonies. The creation of the reserve made it possible to preserve the pelicans in this area. The restricting factors limiting their number are a lack of breeding grounds, predatory mammals, an increase in water salinity, and a decrease in fish resources. The breeding of pelicans has been negatively affected in recent decades by climate aridization, which has led to the drying up of waterbodies and the intensification of economic activities of the population. The article proposes measures for the further preservation of pelicans, as well as other rare and valuable animals in the reserve.

Sinuous stromatolites of the Chandi Formation, Chattisgarh Basin, India: their origin and implications for Mesoproterozoic seawater	GEOLOGICAL MAGAZINE												Remnants of some of the planet's most ancient life forms, stromatolites in the late Mesoproterozoic sea of the Chattisgarh Basin, India, preserve a conspicuous sinuous pattern. They occur as successive biostromes, 10-30 cm thick, separated by 2-5-cm-thick marly layers and discrete bioherms up to several metres thick and 20 m across. Stromatolite columns in the Chandi Formation are 5-10 cm high, sinuous, inclined and straight, with both branched and non-branched types. These stromatolites are composed of calcite micrite and show well defined light and dark laminae with evidence of erosion between lamina sets. The column sinuosity probably originated as a response to changes in direction and strength of currents. Successive flat beds of stromatolite (biostromes), separated by marl/clay horizons, impart a rhythmic pattern to the succession. The Chandi sinuous stromatolite columns resemble those occurring in China, North America and Siberia, of a comparable age, suggesting that similar marine conditions of stromatolite formation might have been operating in the late Mesoproterozoic seas worldwide. However, the petrographic and sedimentological analyses of these stromatolites indicate their development through in situ production of carbonate with some trapping and binding of detrital sediment. As a result of the presence of terrigenous material within the stromatolites, whole-rock geochemical analyses for trace elements and rare earth elements cannot be used for interpretation of seawater chemistry and the redox conditions at the time.

Microbial mats and evaporite facies variation in a supralittoral, ephemeral lake, Red Sea coast, Saudi Arabia	FACIES												This study documents the deposits of an ephemeral, shallow lake that is recharged mainly from floods and torrential rainfalls from the Red Sea Mountains, in addition to seawater seepage at its western margin. The lake is desiccated in the summer months into several smaller, ephemeral pans and sabkhas due to excessive evaporation of its waters and decreased inflow of seawater seepage accompanied by the lowered hydraulic gradient between the Red Sea and the lake floor. The formation and distribution of microbial mats, gypsum and halite are discussed with respect to water supply and salinity. Microbial mats dominate the floor of the wintertime lake, and in the summertime, coastal pans where salinity is less than 126%. Gypsum crystals encrust microbial mats at salinities in excess of 182%. The central and eastern pans are floored with halite crusts at a salinity > 250% that develop into tepee polygons through desiccation. The slightly higher topographic sabkha areas around these pans contain subsurface, displacive, lenticular and tabular gypsum crystals, and clear, mosaic halite cement. Most of the water supplied to the supralittoral lake is during the wintertime, from episodic floods from the hinterland with a general increase in salinity towards the sea. However, the pattern of distribution and abundance of microbial mats-gypsum-halite facies are in a reverse order to the direction of water supply and increases in salinity. This ambiguity can be explained by the intermittent supply of seawater seepage from the Red Sea through an artificial barrier that is controlled by tidal range and fluctuations of sea level.					; Mannaa, Ammar/AAX-9697-2020; Aref, Mahmoud/H-8894-2012	Aref, Mahmoud/0000-0001-8954-8096; 													0172-9179	1612-4820				JAN	2022	68	1							3	10.1007/s10347-021-00641-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10347-021-00641-0													WOS:000731397300001

Pollen, microcharcoal and magnetic susceptibility analyses of two sedimentary sequences from Lake Zirahuen in western central Mexico spanning the last 17,000 years provide evidence of a highly dynamic environment. During the late glacial Pinus forest developed around the lake, indicating cold and dry conditions. During the last deglaciation climatic amelioration was recorded at 13.5 ka, driving a strong and rapid change in vegetation composition and increase in lake levels. From the latest Pleistocene to early Holocene a hiatus, probably related to an erosive event, is recognized in the northern sequence. The central sequence spans the entire Holocene and reveals three periods of important ecological changes during the early Holocene. A first episode between 9.5 and 9.0 ka with a decrease in pine forest seems to have been associated with summer insolation increases. A second peak of forest change at 8.2 ka and was probably associated with the cold oscillation documented in the North Atlantic. A third abrupt change was evident from 7.5 to 7.1 ka with an anomalous plant community related to wetter Holocene climates and possible to a volcanic event. An episode of dry conditions was recorded from 4.5 to 4.2 ka, which was related to an increase in ENSO activity. Human influence over the landscape was evident from 3.5 ka to the present. The Zirahuen records offer a complex history of a landscape characterized by short and long term vegetation changes associated with factors ranging from global climate to local disturbances.

Comparison of lake and land tephra records from the 2015 eruption of Calbuco volcano, Chile	BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY												Tephra layers in lake sediment cores are regularly used for tephrostratigraphy as isochronous features for dating and recording eruption frequencies. However, their value for determining volcanic eruption size and style may be complicated by processes occurring in the lake that modify the thickness and grain size distributions of the deposit. To assess the reliability of data from lake cores, we compare tephra deposited on land during the 2015 eruption of Calbuco volcano in Chile to records in sediment cores from three lakes of different sizes that are known to have received primary fall deposits. In general, the thickness and granulometry of the deposit in lake cores and nearby terrestrial sections are very similar. As anticipated, however, cores sampled close to (here, within 300m of) fluvial inflows were affected by sediment deposition from the lake's catchment; they differed from primary deposits not only in their greater thickness and organic content but also in poor sorting and lack of grading. Cores 850m away from the inlet were not affected. We consider our results in the context of the particle settling regime as well as each lake's location, bathymetry and catchment area. We find that the particle settling regime is important in more distal settings where the ash particles are small and particle settling occurs in density plumes rather than as individual particles. We conclude that lake cores can be useful for physical volcanology providing consideration is given to eruption parameters such as particle size and mass flux, as well as lake features such as bathymetry and catchment area.

Multi-scale thermal pattern monitoring of a large lake (Lake Geneva) using a multi-sensor approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The applicability of satellite imagery products from different sensors (AVHRR-derived multi-channel sea surface temperature (MCSST), MODIS sea surface temperature (SST) products 5-Min L2 Swath 1km and Landsat TM band 6 thermal signature) for the comprehensive monitoring of temperature and its temporal patterns over a large lake is tested in this study. The coverage of cloud-free satellite data for Lake Geneva is reported throughout a year and, more specifically, during a 13 day period in summer 2003. In a second step, we demonstrate the feasibility of the AVHRR/MODIS imagery to discern day and night temperature patterns, by generating day and night climatologies and various spatial statistics over the 13 day period. The different day and night surface thermal patterns observed by satellite imagery could be linked to the thermal structure existing in deeper water using the concept of the diurnal decoupled layer. The forcing of the persistent patterns, two warm cores divided by a saddle-shaped cold anomaly, is explained by wind periodicity and insolation conditions. The patterns can be matched to features postulated by findings of different limnologists in the past. Other surface temperature related phenomena such as water upwelling and downwelling and the occurrence of plumes are related to meteorological and hydrological events. The lakewide average lake surface water temperature (LSWT) trends for day and night during the study period are roughly parallel. A sudden loss of stored heat can be explained by episodes of long fetch, synoptic wind (bise) that interrupted the predominant breeze regime.																			0143-1161	1366-5901					2008	29	20					5785	5808		10.1080/01431160802132786	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431160802132786													WOS:000259366300002

In recent years, geoarchaeological research at the site of the Temple of Bastet at Bubastis in the southeastern Nile Delta has proven the existence of two water canals surrounding the temple. It has now been investigated whether these canals were connected to the Temple of Pepi I (2300-2250 B.C.E.), located approximately 100 m to the west of the Temple of Bastet. To explore the Holocene landscape genesis of the Temple of Pepi I, 15 drillings and six geoelectrical profile lines were performed in the surroundings of the temple in spring 2022. The results show loamy to clayey sediments in deeper sections of all drillings with a maximum thickness of 1.70 m, indicating a marshy or swampy depositional environment. Based on the recovered sediment sequences and archaeological remains in the vicinity of the Temple of Pepi I, the marshy or swampy area existed before the Fourth Dynasty. During the Old Kingdom (ca. 2850-2180 B.C.E.), the former marshland either dried up through natural processes or was intentionally drained and filled with sediments for subsequent use for occupation. Regarding the original research question, there is as yet no evidence for a direct connection to the canals of the Temple of Bastet.					; Abd El-Raouf, Amr/AAN-1268-2021; Meister, Julia/JVN-6546-2024; El-Raouf, Amr/AAN-1268-2021	Lange-Athinodorou, Eva/0000-0002-2608-1158; Meister, Julia/0000-0003-1385-4112; Garbe, Philipp/0009-0000-6175-6117; El-Raouf, Amr/0000-0002-2074-0132													0883-6353	1520-6548				JAN	2024	39	1					17	34		10.1002/gea.21981	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/gea.21981		OCT 2023											WOS:001081539700001
J	FOSKETT, DR				FOSKETT, DR			THE RIVERS INLET SOCKEYE SALMON	JOURNAL OF THE FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD OF CANADA												The Rivers Inlet sockeye catch has averaged about 1 million fish/year, over 45 years. These are from smolts produced in a cold, deep lake, only 30 square miles in extent, and most of it heavily silted by glacial tributaries. The water has only a moderate lime content and its reaction is neutral or very slightly acid. The lake''s plankton crops are small, though blooms of bluegreen algae occur in autumn in the clear uppermost basins, following on the death of large numbers of spawning sockeye. Smolts are unusually small in size, averaging about 2 grams when sampled in 1914-16 and again in 1954; almost all are age 1. The commercial gill-net fishery harvests most efficiently the salmon of intermediate sizes the medium and large age 4 fish, and the medium and small age 5 fish. Hence escapement tends to consist of extremes of size, the larger age 5''s, smaller age 4''s, and almost all the age 3''s. Sockeye spawning takes place in many inlet streams, along parts of the lake shore, and in the outlet river. The spawners in the various tributaries differ considerably in respect to the age structure of their runs, and to some extent in size at a given age, though the selective fishery may account for some part of these differences. Conditions for spawning and incubation in the region are still practically in their natural state. The most important management problem is to determine whether increasing the fry output into the lake would increase or decrease production of adult sockeye: the smolts are now so small that any larger numbers might possibly reduce their size below some critical level. Next in importance is to determine whether or not the present numbers of spawners are necessary to fertilize the lake for the growth of the young, and if so, whether a less valuable fertilizer might be substituted.																									1958	15	5					867	889		10.1139/f58-049	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f58-049													WOS:A1958WZ01400010

Springtime boundary layer O3 and GEM depletion at Toolik Lake, Alaska	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Atmospheric surface ozone (O-3) was measured at Toolik Lake, Alaska, from September 2010 to August 2011, along with winter and springtime (January-May) measurements of gaseous elemental mercury (GEM). Concurrent episodic springtime depletion of both O-3 and GEM was observed between April and May 2011. To investigate these depletion events, surface O-3 measurements from Toolik Lake were compared with similar measurements from Barrow, the only Alaskan site available to use as an indicator of conditions at the Arctic Ocean coastline. Barrow is located approximately 400 km to the northwest of Toolik Lake. In all cases where O-3 and GEM depletion was observed at Toolik Lake, similar O-3 depletion events (ODEs) were observed at Barrow. Conversely, in over half of the instances where ODEs were observed at Barrow, no such events were recorded at Toolik Lake. The Lagrangian particle dispersion model FLEXPART was utilized to interpret the transport conditions and potential influence of oceanic air masses on depletion events observed at Toolik Lake. These analyses indicate that ODEs observed at Toolik Lake are correlated with depletion events observed at Barrow when the prevailing airflow is from the north and the air mass has spent substantial time over the Arctic Ocean or coast within the previous week. These observations suggest that coastal O-3 and GEM-depleted air masses are likely transported from the Arctic Ocean up to similar to 200 km inland and to at least an altitude of 700 m above sea level. These observations underscore that O-3 and GEM depletion events impact not just the Arctic coastal zone but also extensive inland areas with possible implications for the cycling and bioavailability of mercury (Hg) to inland Arctic ecosystems.

Trophic state responses of Onondaga Lake, New York, to reductions in phosphorus loading from advanced wastewater treatment	INLAND WATERS												This study evaluated the response of previously culturally hypereutrophic Onondaga Lake, New York, to major reductions in phosphorus (P) loading from a municipal wastewater treatment plant achieved over a 35-year period. Analysis of the response was based on long-term monitoring of effluent total P concentration (TPMetro) and a robust array of in-lake metrics of trophic state, including (1) TP, (2) chlorophyll a (Chl-a), (3) Secchi disk depth, (4) areal hypolimnetic oxygen deficit (AHOD), (5) the downward flux of volatile suspended solids, and (6) the minimum dissolved oxygen concentration in the upper waters during fall turnover. Substantial positive responses, which were significantly linearly related to the decreases in TPMetro, were documented for all of the metrics over the monitoring period. For example, a 91% reduction in TPMetro resulted in reductions of 84% and 59% in Chl-a and AHOD, respectively. The changes depict a transformation from hypereutrophy to upper mesotrophy, with the exception of AHOD values that remain in the eutrophic range. The delayed response of AHOD reflects slower sediment diagenesis processes. The relationships among the metrics of trophic state are considered in the context of literature expressions, accepted paradigms, and limitations related to variations in food web effects. Empirical models that include the effects of multiple drivers on interannual variations in contemporary trophic state metrics were developed and applied to forecast variability under existing conditions. This case study contributes to the scientific literature describing lake rehabilitation through reductions in P loading.

J	Bisgin, AT				Bisgin, Abdullah Taner			The novel extraordinary separation and preconcentration approach for Cd2+: "Hydrophobic Immiscible Chelating Fluid" based micro-extraction	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR LIQUIDS												The novel, extraordinary and highly selective separation and preconcentration approach based on hydrophobic immiscible chelating fluid (HICF) having superior features (simultaneous chelation, extraction and masking) and combined with automatized syringe discharge system by peristaltic pump was established firstly for simulta-neous chelation and micro-extraction of Cd2+. Mixture of tetra butyl ammonium iodide, tetra butyl ammonium fluoride, n-pentanol (1:1:10) and dithizone were used to formulate HICF. The parameters including pH, chelator concentration on both characteristic of HICF and extraction of Cd2+, time of vortex mixing, amount of HICF and sample volume were optimized and investigated in detail. The optimized method has permitted to obtain 25 preconcentration factor (PF) and detect the lowest cadmium concentration having 2.1 & mu;g L-1 (LOD) in the aqueous solution. Interference effect of defiant metal cations was investigated in detail. The dynamic range of the method (LDR) was obtained linearly between 7.2 and 1500 & mu;g L-1. Relative standard deviations (% RSD) were below than % 4.2 throughout the experiments. The envisaged possible extraction mechanisms were explained. The proposed novel method was validated with applications of multiple analyte-addition recovery tests in water samples (tap, lake and natural spring water) and analysis of standard reference material (UME EnvCRM 03 El-ements in Soil). Quantitative satisfactory recovery values changing between 98 and 106 % were obtained. Validated method was also applied to determine Cd contents of sediment, mushroom and raw tobacco samples. The main advantage of HICF is that it contains masking and chelating agents and extraction solvent in only one liquid. Therefore, possible concentration and volume errors were minimized by single micropipette injection that ensured time saving and simplicity for applicability of the method by the analysts. Moreover, automated syringe discharge system has provided repeatable and precision extraction results.

Using reservoir sediment deposits to determine the longer-term fate of chernobyl-derived 137Cs fallout in the fluvial system	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Vast areas of Europe were contaminated by the fallout of Cs-137 and other radionuclides, as a result of the Chernobyl accident in 1986. The post-fallout redistribution of Chernobyl-derived Cs-137 was associated with erosion and sediment transport processes within the fluvial system. Bottom sediments from lakes and reservoirs can provide a valuable source of information regarding the post-fallout redistribution and fate of Cs-137 released by the Chernobyl accident. A detailed investigation of sediment-associated Cs-137 in the bottom sediments of a reservoir in a Chernobyl-affected area in Central Russia has been undertaken. A new approach, based on the vertical distribution of Cs-137 activity concentrations in the reservoir bottom sediment makes it possible to separate the initially deposited bottom sediment, where the Cs-137 activity reflects the direct fallout of Chernobyl-derived Cs-137 to the reservoir surface and its subsequent incorporation into sediment deposited immediately after the accident, from the sediment mobilized from the catchment deposited subsequently. The deposits representing direct fallout from the atmosphere was termed the "Chernobyl peak". Its shape can be described by a diffusion equation and it can be distinguished from the remaining catchment-derived Cs-137 associated with sediment accumulated with sediments during the post-Chernobyl period. The Cs-137 depth distribution above the "Chernobyl peak" was used to provide a record of changes in the concentration of sediment-associated Cs-137 transported from the upstream catchment during the post-Chernobyl period. It was found that the Cs-137 activity concentration in the sediment deposited in the reservoir progressively decreased during the 30-year period after the accident due to a reduction in the contribution of sediment eroded from the arable land in the catchment. This reflects a reduction in both the area of cultivated land area and the reduced incidence of surface runoff from the slopes during spring snowmelt due to climate warming. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Evaluation of Trophic Niche Overlap between Native Fishes and Young-of-the-Year Common Carp	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												Common carp Cyprinus carpio is a ubiquitous invasive species that commonly imposes negative effects on aquatic ecosystems. However, research evaluating the effects of carp on native fishes is limited. Carp are highly fecund and larvae and juveniles can be abundant. If age-0 carp use similar prey resources as native fishes, they may compete if food becomes limited. We used traditional diet analysis for samples during Jul. and Aug. 2008 in Brant Lake. Stable isotopes were used for samples collected during Aug. and Sep. 2009 in Brant Lake and Lake Sinai to examine prey resource use by age-0 carp and four native fishes: bluegill Lepomis macrochirus, black crappie Pomoxis nigromaculatus, yellow perch Perca flavescens, and orangespotted sunfish Lepomis humilis. Age-0 carp were generally as or more abundant than native fishes. In Jul. Daphnia dominated the diets of all fishes sampled, resulting in high (>60%) dietary overlap ranging from 87-98%. In Aug. Daphnia density in Brant Lake declined and dominant diet prey types shifted for carp (to Trichoptera and Daphnia), yellow perch (to Amphipoda), and the three Centrarchids (to Cyclops and Diaptomus). This diet shift resulted in lower diet overlap between Centrarchids and either carp (<40%) or yellow perch (3-16%) but high diet overlap within Centrarchids (67-97%). Stable isotope analysis further indicated greater resource overlap when most fishes relied on zooplankton and lesser overlap as fishes shifted to benthic prey. Our results suggest that resource competition between age-0 carp and native fishes is most likely to occur during early summer if Daphnia availability becomes limited but becomes less likely as dominant prey in diets increasingly diverge among fish species over time.																			0003-0031	1938-4238				JUL	2014	172	1					91	106		10.1674/0003-0031-172.1.91	http://dx.doi.org/10.1674/0003-0031-172.1.91													WOS:000338948300007

Facies and ground-penetrating radar characteristics of coarse-grained beach deposits of the uppermost Pleistocene glacial Lake Algonquin, Ontario, Canada	SEDIMENTOLOGY												The lithofacies of the uppermost Pleistocene (ca 11 800 to 10 400 C-14 yr bp), cold-temperate, coarse-grained beach deposits of Lake Algonquin, the precursor of the present Lake Huron of North America, have been studied and interpreted based on analogous features of modern beaches from the same region. Ice foot and ice-cementation develop during winter but, unlike Arctic beaches, ice-related sedimentary features are seldom, if ever, preserved in the Pleistocene and recent deposits of the Great Lakes. Instead, the deposits retain the typical characteristics of wave-dominated, pure gravel and mixed sand and gravel beaches, there including the classical subdivision of infill zone, swash zone/sand run, imbricated zone, coarse flat-clast zone and coastal dunes. These zones form a regular succession on the surface of many modern beaches; however, they seldom occur as quasi-complete vertical successions in older deposits. In the studied uppermost Pleistocene deposits, the various components are separated vertically by erosional contacts (bounding surfaces) readily recognizable on working faces of large sand and gravel pits and mappable in the subsurface by ground-penetrating radar. The lithofacies are sufficiently diagnostic to allow recognition of depositional settings, and the lithofacies architecture allows the deciphering of important geological events, such as: (i) local input of fluvial material onto the shoreface, where it was partially reworked by waves and moved onto the beachface; (ii) occurrence of major storm events; and (iii) repeated rapid transgressions and regressions typical of the glacial-lake precursors of the modern Great Lakes.																			0037-0746	1365-3091				FEB	2009	56	2					529	545		10.1111/j.1365-3091.2008.00984.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3091.2008.00984.x													WOS:000262296700009
J	Ostrowska, P				Ostrowska, Patrycja			Cadmium - Occurrence, use and methods of recycling	GOSPODARKA SUROWCAMI MINERALNYMI-MINERAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												Cadmium, which is a relatively rare element, constitutes about 0,0004% of the earth's crust. In nature, it seldom occurs in self-contained mineral, mostly it is found in the sulphide ores of zinc. Nowadays, cadmium is one of the most serious environmental and human health hazard. Because of its land filling in waste material on piles and heaps, it is a substantial danger for water environment, soil and atmosphere. All the systems are closely related to each other and they interacts. The contamination of at least one, causes huge losses in the rest of them. As an example we can take the cadmium emission to atmosphere during metallurgical processes. In the end it blends with rain and snow, and falls on the ground, becoming the substance polluting water and soil. The contaminations in the soil, which is the main link in food chain, soil-plants-animals, go to human organism. On the other side, volatile cadmium compounds, that went as the pollutions to lakes and rivers, after evaporating, become the substances polluting air. Cadmium is a cumulating and highly toxic element, that have genotoxic, mutagen and carcinogenic, teratogen, endocrine and handicapping reproduction influence. Thinking about cadmium negative environmental influence, it is justified to neutralize and manage cadmium from waste material. It will allow us to limit cadmium emission to natural environment, and also it will decrease exploitation of natural resources. The article describes cadmium occurrence in natural environment, main use in economy, the sources of pollution, and methods of recovery from waste material.																			0860-0953						2008	24	3	3				255	260																WOS:000259858900024

In the period 1976-78, the microbiological observations showed evidence of eutrophication, e.g. bacterial densities reaching up to 3 x 10(6) cells ml(-1), dark CO2-fixation up to 11 mu g C l(-1) d(-1) and bacterial respiration up to 0.7 mg O-2 l(-1) d(-1). From 1977 to 1981, the highest values were typically obtained in the south littoral zone, where high levels of nutrients were discharged from the Volkhov River. At this stage, the values observed in the open lake were typical for oligotrophic waters, and the high values in near-shore areas indicating mesotrophy. In the subsequent years, the highest summer values of bacterial numbers and dark CO2-uptake have been generally observed in the offshore regions (up to 5 x 10(6) cells ml(-1), and up to 21 mu g C l(-1) d(-1), respectively), thus showing that the initial spatial heterogeneity has changed to a more homogeneous pattern. The same tendency is evident in phytoplankton. Rates of nitrification have been relatively low (up to 24.3 mu g N l(-1) d(-1)) and lacking definite spatial patterns.																			0018-8158					APR 12	1996	322	1-3					17	22		10.1007/BF00031800	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00031800													WOS:A1996UT84700004
J	Wolfe, AP; Siver, PA				Wolfe, Alexander P.; Siver, Peter A.			A hypothesis linking chrysophyte microfossils to lake carbon dynamics on ecological and evolutionary time scales	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												Chrysophyte algae are common in the plankton of oligotrophic lakes and produce a rich microfossil record of siliceous cysts and scales. Paleolimnological investigations and phytoplankton records suggest that chrysophyte populations are increasing in a wide range of boreal and arctic lakes, ultimately representing one component of the limnological response to contemporary global changes. However, the exact mechanisms responsible for widespread increases of chrysophyte populations remain elusive. We hypothesize that recent increases in chrysophytes are related to rising pCO(2) in lakes, in part because these algae lack carbon concentrating mechanisms and therefore rely on diffusive entry of CO2 to Rubisco during photosynthesis. We assessed the abundance of modem sediment chrysophyte microfossils in relation to summer CO2 relative saturation in 46 New England (USA) lakes, revealing significant positive relationships for both cysts and scales. These observations imply that correlations between chrysophytes and limnological conditions including low pH, oligotrophy, and elevated dissolved organic matter are ultimately underscored by the high pCO(2) associated with these conditions. In lakes where chrysophyte populations have expanded over recent decades, we infer that increasingly heterotrophic conditions with respect to CO2 have stimulated production by these organisms. This linkage is supported by the remarkable abundance and diversity of chrysophytes from middle Eocene lake sediments, deposited under atmospheric CO2 concentrations significantly higher than present. The Eocene assemblages suggest that any chrysophyte-CO2 connection bome out of results from modem and sub-recent sediments also operated on evolutionary time scales, and thus the absence of carbon concentrating mechanisms appears to be an ancient feature within the group. Chrysophyte microfossils may potentially provide important insights concerning the temporal dynamics of carbon cycling in aquatic ecosystems. (C) 2013 Elsevier BV.

J	Casper, AF; Johnson, LE				Casper, Andrew F.; Johnson, Ladd E.			Contrasting shell/tissue characteristics of Dreissena polymorpha and Dreissena bugensis in relation to environmental heterogeneity in the St. Lawrence River	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, is widespread in the St. Lawrence River while the conspecific quagga mussel, Dreissena bugensis, is found only in the Lake Ontario outflow region of the river. This situation provided an opportunity to evaluate in situ environmental and interspecific heterogeneity in shell and tissue growth. Shell dry weight, carbon content, and shell strength of D. polymorpha from the four spatially discrete water masses differed significantly. For instance, D. polymorpha total and tissue mass increased over the summer in the shallow fluvial Lac Saint-Pierre but decreased in the upstream and downstream water masses. Standardized shell mass and strength of a polymorpha was lowest where the mussels experienced salinity or low calcium. Although the response pattern of mass and glycogen content for D. polymorpha was spatially complex, mussels from the stressful oligohaline estuary population had the weakest shells and lowest glycogen content, even though their standardized tissue mass was the heaviest. This disparity in shell and tissue response suggests that some aspect of shell physiology alone may be limiting these mussels in estuarine environments. Tissue characteristics of D. polymorpha and D. bugensis were similar at the site where both were present, but the shell strength of D. bugensis was only equivalent to the weakest of D. polymorpha. We also conclude that lighter shells might make D. bugensis more susceptible to predation or mechanical damage but may also offer a bioenergetic advantage that is contributing to its rapid displacement of D. polymorpha where the two species co-occur.

Monitoring of jokulhlaups and element fluxes in proglacial Icelandic rivers using osmotic samplers	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												The quantification of volatile emissions from volcanoes is an integral part of understanding magmatic systems, with the exsolution and extent of volcanic degassing having a large impact on the nature of an eruption. Measurements of volatiles have traditionally focused on gas emissions into the atmosphere, but volatiles can also become dissolved in proximal water bodies en route to the surface. Thus the monitoring of rivers draining active volcanic areas can provide insights to identifying changes in activity. This process is particularly important for sub-glacial volcanoes in Iceland, where much of the volatile release is transported within glacial outbreak floods, termed jokulhlaups. Monitoring and characterising these phenomena is hampered by the dependence on spot sampling of stochastic events under challenging field conditions, which often leads to bias in the collected data. A recent technological advance is the osmotic sampler, an electricity-free pump that continuously collects water that can subsequently be divided into time-averaged samples. This technique allows for continued and unsupervised deployment of a sampler for weeks to months, representing a cost-efficient form of chemical monitoring. In this study we deployed osmotic samplers in two rivers in southern Iceland. Skalm is a proglacial river from Myrdalsjokull glacier and Katla volcano, while Skafta is a larger drainage system from the western part of Vatnajokull glacier. Both rivers are prone to jokulhlaups from geothermal and volcanic sources, and a small jokulhlaup of geothermal origin occurred during the second deployment in Skafta in January 2014. The two deployments show that osmotic samplers are capable of delivering accurate chemical data in turbulent conditions for several key elements. Total dissolved fluxes for the deployment at Skafta are calculated to be Na =9.9 tonnes/day, Mg = 10.5 t/d, Si = 34.7 t/d, Cl = 11.0 t/d, Ca = 31.6 t/d, DIC = 50.8 t/d, and SO4 = 28.3 t/d, with significant elevations of element concentrations during the jokulhlaup. Dissolved fluxes vary considerably on temporal scales from days to seasons, so that spot sampling may miss pulses in concentrations. This is particularly important for elements such as Mn. The continuous geochemical records from the osmotic samplers make it possible to identify pulses of fluxes attributed to sea spray, groundwater, and subglacial sources. The samplers can also be combined with existing methods of river monitoring, such as conductivity and discharge, to accurately assess changes to fluvial chemistry due to volcanic inputs. Moreover, there is the potential to deploy osmotic samplers in a range of other affected water bodies (e.g. wells, springs, lakes) to gain further insights into volcanic processes.

J	Krevs, A; Kucinskiene, A				Krevs, Alina; Kucinskiene, Ale			Influence of invasive Acer negundo leaf litter on benthic microbial abundance and activity in the littoral zone of a temperate river in Lithuania	KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS												Riparian forests are known as important source of allochthonous organic matter entering to water ecosystems via fallen leaves. However, leaf litter, depending on their quality, may create different conditions for benthic microorganisms functioning in littoral zone of water bodies. In order to evaluate the impact of riparian invasive Acer negundo on littoral water zone of the River Neris (Lithuania), we performed physicochemical and microbiological investigations in bottom sediments of three different sites of the river. One sampling site was close by riparian A. negundo, another close by native Alnus glutinosa location and a third zone was near the shore without riparian vegetation. Content of nutrients in the littoral sediments differed between invasive and native trees leaf litter accumulation sites, while not always significantly. The highest microbial densities as well as benthic community respiratory activity (expressed as the rate of organic carbon mineralization) occurred in A. negundo leaves accumulation site. In sediments of this site, the most intensive anaerobic terminal organic carbon mineralization process - sulfate reduction and the highest concentration of hydrogen sulfide were also observed. Differences in the intensity of mineralization processes between sites suggest that the replacement of the riparian native species such as dominant A. glutinosa by invasive A. negundo with higher biodegradability leaves may induce local changes in organic matter processing in the littoral zone of the river. The increase of littoral bioproductivity in the accumulation zone of A. negundo leaf litter can occur due to the inflow of available organic matter and its intensive mineralization.																			1961-9502						2017		418							26	10.1051/kmae/2017015	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/kmae/2017015													WOS:000406714700007

Whereas transpiration, the dominant process, has the extensive vegetation cover as a large single source, evaporation can have several sources, and their relative importance and location are poorly known. The isotopic composition (delta(18)O and delta D) of water from various sources was used to see whether or not specific sources of water vapor to the atmosphere could be determined. It is well established that natural waters fall on a line called the meteoric water line (MWL; the regression of delta(18)O x delta D), With slope equal to eight and an intercept equal to ten. When a water body loses water via evaporation the slope become smaller than eight, typically 5-6. We estimated the slope of the regression of delta(18)O x delta D for several potential sources. We analyzed 1273 samples: 500 of rainfall, 409 of river water, 134 of lake water, 164 of soil water, 40 of throughfall and stemflow water, and 26 of shallow ground-water. We found that large rivers and lakes are likely contributors of evaporated water to the atmosphere. However, as they cover only a small area of the basin, other sources are needed. Probably, evaporated water originates from several small sources that were not detected by the isotopic composition of our data.

This is most critical for carbonate isotope analyses from bulk sediments containing comparably high amounts of organic matter (OM). Several methods have been developed to remove OM prior to analyses, but none of them can be universally applied. Moreover, pretreatment methods cause isotopic bias in themselves and should probably best be avoided. Thus, it is essential to have indicators for reliable isotope values of untreated carbonate-OM mixtures. METHODS Artificial mixtures of organic compounds with a standard carbonate were analyzed to investigate the bias on carbonate isotope ratios caused by OM in the sample. The total-inorganic-carbon to total-organic-carbon ratio (TIC/TOC) was used as a measure for the " organic impurity" of the sample. The target was to evaluate TIC/TOC as a measure for sample quality and to define TIC/TOC thresholds for reliable isotope measurements of mixtures between calcium carbonate and organic compounds. RESULTS The effect of organic impurities on carbonate stable isotope values depended on the specific OM compound and the respective TIC/TOC ratio. Different CO2 release rates were determined for the pure OM compounds. A sample TIC/TOC ratio 0.3 was found to be a threshold for reliable measurements of the isotope composition of calcium carbonate. CONCLUSIONS Bulk carbonate analyses from carbonate-OM mixtures are reliable only if the TIC/TOC values do not fall below certain thresholds. This has implications for carbonate isotope studies from bulk sediments for which the TIC/TOC ratios should be considered as an easy-to-determine measure for sample-quality assessment.

A 20-year Landsat water clarity census of Minnesota's 10,000 lakes	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												A 20-year comprehensive water clarity database assembled from Landsat imagery, primarily Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus, for Minnesota lakes larger than 8 ha in surface area contains data on more than 10,500 lakes at five-year intervals over the period 1985-2005. The reliability of the data was evaluated by examining the precision of repeated measurements on individual lakes within short time periods using data from adjacent overlapping Landsat paths and by comparing water clarity computed from Landsat data to field-collected Secchi depth data. The agreement between satellite data and field measurements of Secchi depth within Landsat paths was strong (average R-2 of 0.83 and range 0.71-0.96). Relationships between late-summer Landsat and field-measured Secchi depth for the combined statewide data similarly were strong (r(2) of 0.77-0.80 for individual time periods and r(2) = 0.78 for the entire database). Lake clarity has strong geographic patterns in Minnesota; lakes in the south and southwest have low clarity, and lakes in the north and northeast tend to have the highest clarity. This pattern is evident at both the individual lake and the ecoregion level. Mean water clarity in the Northern Lakes and Forest and North Central Hardwood Forest ecoregions in central and northern Minnesota remained stable from 1985 to 2005 while decreasing water clarity trends were detected in the Western Corn Belt Plains and Northern Glaciated Plains ecoregions in southern Minnesota, where agriculture is the predominant land use. Mean water clarity at the statewide level also remained stable with an average around 2.25 m from 1985 to 2005. This assessment demonstrates that satellite imagery can provide an accurate method for obtaining comprehensive spatial and temporal coverage of key water quality characteristics that can be used to detect trends at different geographic scales.

We carried out field investigations for five years and reported the results of bryophyte diversity in eight volcanic lava caves of Jingpo Lake World Geopark, where the largest underground lava caves in China are preserved. The results are as follows: (1) A total of 230 quadrats were set up, and 2041 bryophyte specimens were collected. The specimens belong to 272 species of 107 genera in 47 families, including 26 liverworts (13 genera, 11 families) and 246 mosses (94 genera, 36 families). (2) The & alpha; diversity of bryophytes in Underground Lava Fall Cave was the highest, while that in Foggy Cave was the lowest. (3) The dominant families included Mniaceae, etc, accounting for 55.9% of the total species. The dominant genera included Plagiomnium, etc, accounting for 24.3% of the total species. The dominant species included Sanionia uncinata (Hedw.) Loeske etc. (4) There are no shared species among all eight lava caves, and each cave has a unique species composition. (5) Compared with that in other habitats in our previous studies, the similarity of bryophyte species between lava caves and underground forests of craters was high (113 species, 40.07%), while it was low between lava caves and lava platforms (9 species, 4.65%). Our study revealed that the lava caves have a high potential for bryophyte diversity, and such ancient ecological disaster sites are now rare refuges for bryophytes. Mosses are more adapted to cave habitats than liverworts. Bryophytes in this special eco-environment need to be considered and protected in order to preserve high-quality gene resources for humans, which is of great significance for the maintenance and development of biodiversity.

Microorganisms, especially bacteria, secrete extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) to form slime layers in which they reproduce. In the sedimentary environment, biofilms commonly contain the products of degraded bacteria as well as allochthonous and autochthonous mineral components. They are complex structures which serve as protection for the colonies of microorganisms living in them and also act as nutrient traps. Biofilms are almost ubiquitous wherever there is an interface and moisture (liquid/liquid, liquid/solid, liquid/gas, solid/gas). In sedimentary rocks they are commonly recognized as stromatolites. We also discuss the distinction between bacterial biofilms and prebiotic films. The EPS and cell components of the microbial biofilms contain many cation chelation sites which are implicated in the mineralization of the films. EPS, biofilms, and their related components thus have strong preservation potential in the rock record. Fossilized microbial polymeric substances (FPS) and biofilms appear to retain the same morphological characteristics as the unfossilized material and have been recognized in rock formations dating back to the Early Archaean (3.5 b.y.). We describe FPS and biofilms from hot spring, deep-sea, volcanic lake, and shallow marine/littoral environments ranging up to 3.5 b.y. in age. FPS and biofilms are more commonly observed than fossil bacteria themselves, especially in the older part of the terrestrial record. The widespread distribution of microbial biofilms and their great survival potential makes their fossilized remains a useful biomarker as a proxy for life with obvious application to the search for life in extraterrestrial materials.

Miguel Fisac is commisioned for the Project of the Parish Church of Canfranc (Huesca). It was the summer of 1964, and the initial approach to renovate the old church. it is transformed following the indications of Fisac itself to build a new church, which will include both the church and adjacent areas for parish use. This work deserves a prominent critical appraisal therefore signal a turning point in the religious Architecture by Fisac, as to show the importance of the place as origin of the project. A mandatory starting point when it comes to building in such a demanding natural environment - in both physical and climatic terms as the landscape If the Pyrenees. Miguel Fisac and his family regularly spent part of the summer in Canfranc since the ate 50s to the mid-80s. In 1959, he built his own house there, that already shows a special attention to empathy with the Pyrenean landscape, through project and material strategies that become manifest with greater intensity in the later project of the Church. A coincidence, the same builder in both works, emphasized the premilinary nature of the housing project for the Church. On the other hand, the evocation of the idea of the altar placed in nature, relating the symbolic sense of architectural and natural elements, had already been explored by Fisac in previous projects in the Pyrenees not built almost none- before materializing it in Canfranc. In this search for a timeless Architecture, merged with the landscape they can be seen both the influence of Nordic empirism as the look to the popular and primitive, as part of the nature of the place. Parish Church in Canfranc comes from the previous religious architecture by Fisac, but also evokes the intensity of religious architecture in the landscape Asplund the interiors of the MIT Chapel by Fero Saarinen-which Fisac visited in 1955-the undulating forms of Ronchamp by Le Corbusier, that also visited in the late 50s in an unknown journey until now-and Aalto-based inspiration in the sinuous forms of nature. Canfranc marks a turning point in its religious architecture, as a receiver of the achievements developed in previous projects but also introduces new significant variations to be developed in his later churche, especially in the mechanism for introducing light with symbolic character in space and adaptation to the post-conciliar renewed liturgy. The integration of this work in the Pyrenean landscape -characterized by mountains, forests and lakes- Jrings us to the presence of the Nordic in his architecture, his admiration for Asplund and Scandinavian empiricism manifested in his trip late 1949, twenty years before the consecration of the church of Our Lady of the Pillar in Lanfranc, on December 14, 1969.

The lake sediments record the climatic variation and response to global climate change on the plateau. Numerous studies of the lake have been conducted, but various opinions remain regarding the palaeoclimatic conditions for the lake since the Last Glacial Maximum, especially the palaeohydrological conditions for the northeastern plateau in the early Holocene. Here, we discuss the hydrogen isotopic composition (delta D) of long-chain leaf wax n-alkanes for studying the hydrological changes in the lake since the Holocene. The results show that, on the northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, C-31 delta D values were quite negative (avg. -202 +/- 4%) in the early Holocene (8-12 ka), indicating a strong monsoon and greater precipitation during that period. During 8-4 ka, C-31 delta D values gradually became more positive, indicating that the monsoon gradually weakened and precipitation gradually decreased. The C31 dD values were more positive in the late Holocene, with a mean value of -186 +/- 3%, showing that the regional monsoon weakened and the amount of precipitation was low. In addition, C-31 dD values indicated large amounts of precipitation in the early Holocene, but the C-29 delta D values during the same period were significantly more positive than C-31 due to a large contribution from aquatic plants. Therefore, the water level of the lake was low in this period, which could be related to strong evaporation of the lake water because of the high temperature in the early Holocene. Our study clarifies the changes in the monsoon and precipitation in the northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and it provides a new estimate of the water level variation in Lake Qinghai in the early Holocene.

However, management aimed only at facilitating access and recreation for citizens can negatively affect the environmental health of these ecosystems since the pristine ecosystem structure is not recovered. In this paper we present early results of a governmental restoration program based on pond cleaning and native vegetation recovery at an artificial lake of the city of Avellaneda (Saladita Norte Reserve), part of the Metropolitan Area of Buenos Aires, one of the largest urban areas with the highest concentrations of inhabitants of the world. We used odonates as indicators because of their quick response to changes in environmental quality. Besides, we tested if the NDVI can be used as a surrogate to monitor changes in dragonfly diversity in managed areas. Since the intervention was carried out during the winter and there were no previous data on the richness or diversity of odonates, we analyzed their response to the intervention comparing it with a lake of similar origin and characteristics but with a different use and management (Saladita Sur Reserve). We recorded in Saladita Norte 81% of the regional diversity, including three newly recorded species, while the lake Saladita Sur, only amounted to 21% of the regional diversity. The NDVI did not reflect the observed changes in the structural complexity of the vegetation and therefore could not be used as a surrogate. These early results indicate that management practices such as the increase of native vegetation on the banks (especially in grassland areas), keeping a diverse floating vegetation and the cleaning and removal of wastes from the water, promote a significant and rapid increase in the levels of biodiversity.

The theory that variations in the earth's orbit determine the amount of radiation and therefore the climate which is the Milankovitch Cycle. In non-marine lacustrine rift basin, the changes of climate can be recorded by the palaeontology, and it also plays an important role in controlling lacustrine fluctuations. The lacustrine fluctuations are indicated by coastal onlap, which is the landward or lake-ward onlap of non-marine coastal deposits. In this paper, based on borehole data, wireline logs, seismic datasets, biostratigraphic data and palaeontology, the lacustrine fluctuation curve can be reconstructed from the onlap of lacustrine deposits in non-marine sequences. The durations and magnitudes of these changes can be used to construct charts showing cycles of the relative rising and falling of lake level. In addition, the changes of lake level can also be reflected by the palaeontology such as pollen. The living conditions and distributions of pollen can be a good indicator for climate changes and lacustrine fluctuations in an a non-marine setting. The calculation of the Milankovitch Cycle can be determined by the GR log in the study area which keeps a record of cycle changes. All climatic changes and lacustrine fluctuations are mainly resulted from the Milankovitch Cycles, and therefore, through the reconstruction of lacustrine fluctuations, climate changes and the Milankovitch Cycle, the correspondences among them can be clearly addressed. All the results can contribute a lot in theory research in the study area and lead to a new focus in practical hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation.

Detailed sedimentologic, biostratigraphic (foraminifers, mollusk, diatoms), X-ray fluorescence geochemical scanning, and oxygen and carbon stable isotope analyses correlated to a calibrated radiocarbon chronology provided evidence for cold and city conditions prior to 15 ka BP, warm conditions of the Bolling-Allerod from similar to 15 to 13 ka BP, a rapid marine incursion at 12 ka BP, still stand of Marmara Sea and sediment reworking of the paleoshorelines during the Younger Dryas at similar to 11.5 to 10.5 ka BP, and development of strong stratification and influx of nutrients as Black Sea waters spilled into Marmara Sea at 9.2 ka BR Stable environmental conditions developed in Marmara Sea after 6.0 ka BP as sea-level reached its present shoreline and the basin floors filled with sediments achieving their present configuration.

During their stay, they mapped many locations, including a native village along the former Clatsop River. Several wooden structures south of the river's outlet to the Pacific Ocean were noted in their journals. As part of a larger collaborative project, we collected ground penetrating radar (GPR) profiles to aid in locating the historic Clatsop River's outlet and previously mapped native structures. After reviewing Lewis and Clark's journals and maps, we constrained the study area to the west shore of Slusher Lake, near Warrenton, OR. Multiple GPR lines were collected with depths of up to 16 m. GPR profiles along the ridge west of Slusher Lake show parallel to sub-parallel, continuous to semi-continuous reflection patterns, which are interpreted as vertically accreting sand dunes. A channel-form pattern was noted northwest of Slusher Lake and is interpreted as the old, relict Clatsop River outlet originally mapped by Lewis and Clark. These results have helped delineate the physical location of the historic native village mapped by Lewis and Clark and provide a foundation from which to base future archaeological investigations.																									2004							471	474																WOS:000225736800112

The integrated biomass of cilates was 5-20 times that of heterotrophic flagellates. During incubation experiments, ciliate growth rates in epilimnetic water corresponded to population doubling times of 9.6-19.4 h, while flagellate populations showed no growth. Most of the ciliates were small forms (10-30-mu-m long), including scuticociliates, choreotrichs, Coleps spp. and Colpoda spp., and appeared to be consuming bacteria, coccoid cyanobacteria, and <5-mu-m eukaryotic algae. Grazing rates of ciliate assemblages on picoplankton in the epilimnion, as determined by the uptake of fluorescently labeled bacteria and cyanobacteria, ranged from 62 to 86 nl cell-1 h-1. Colpoda steini, isolated from lakewater, grew on a cultured freshwater Synechococcus sp. with a doubling time of 4.5 h, and a gross growth efficiency of 48%. The estimated daily requirements of ciliates for growth approximately equalled total phytoplankton production. We calculated that ciliates in the epilimnion were clearing approximately 4-10% of the bacterioplankton and cyanobacterial standing stocks per day. Since this would not be sufficient food consumption to meet daily carbon requirements of the ciliates, it is likely that these organisms were also grazing a significant amount of autotrophic and heterotrophic eukaryotic cells in Lake Kinneret.																			0142-7873	1464-3774				JUL	1991	13	4					789	799		10.1093/plankt/13.4.789	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/13.4.789													WOS:A1991FV24100008
J	LeBreux, M; Lacroix, M; Lachiver, G				LeBreux, Marc; Lacroix, Marcel; Lachiver, Gerard			Control of a hybrid solar/electric thermal energy storage system	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THERMAL SCIENCES												A controller for operating a hybrid thermal energy storage system (HTESS) is presented. The storage system accumulates solar energy during sunny days and releases it later at night or during cloudy days and, simultaneously, it stores electric energy during off-peak periods and releases it later during on-peak periods. The control of the system rests on an anticipatory strategy and on a regulation strategy. The anticipatory strategy is based on a fuzzy logic and feedforward controller (FLFFC) that can handle simultaneously the storage and retrieval of both electricity and solar energy. It lakes into account the weather forecasts for solar radiation and outside air temperature, and optimizes the off and the on-peak periods for electrical heating. The regulation strategy depends on a PID controller which regulates the air flow from an electric fan in order to maintain the room temperature at the set point. Numerical simulations were conducted over one to three-month winter periods to test the response of the controller. Results indicate that the proposed control system is far superior to traditional control systems. It remains robust and reliable even for cases in which the weather forecasts are of poor reliability and accuracy (5-day horizon weather forecasts with reliability of 50%, -10 K temperature accurate and -50% solar radiation accurate). The performance of the HTESS as well as the thermal comfort of the room is maintained in all situations and all times. Moreover, the electricity consumption for space heating is minimized and 95% of this electricity is consumed during off-peak hours. (C) 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS.

In recent years, with the strengthening of human activities, the number of rare cranes has changed significantly. Taking the Shengjin Lake natural wetland as an example, this paper studied the response of crane population to land use change, which had important implications for the protection of cranes. This paper analyzed the land use of Shengjin Lake by referring to the eight periods of TM remote sensing images (1986, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2011 and 2015) and using ERDAS and ArcGIS tools. The diversity of bird habitats in Shengjin Lake nature reserve was analyzed. Combined with the changes in the number of rare cranes from 1986 to 2015, the impacts of land use and climate change on the cranes in protected areas were analyzed. The results showed that: there was a correlation between the number of cranes land use types and climate changes. The type of land of Shengjin Lake nature reserve was relatively small change in the early years in 1986. It was a relatively large change in the type of land, and the number of cranes had a significantly reducing in 1990s. It until 2000, the number of rare cranes had a slight rebound; however from 2012 to 2015, the number of cranes had dropped again. It had a greater influence on the number of cranes about the change of construction land, reeds mudflats, mudflats, marsh land and paddy fields in the wetland.

J	Yoshida, Y; Nakahara, H; Horiya, K				Yoshida, Y; Nakahara, H; Horiya, K			Relationship between the occurrence of Phormidium tenue bloom and water quality or weather factors in the South Basin of Lake Biwa	NIPPON SUISAN GAKKAISHI												In the south basin of Lake Biwa, Phormidium tenue (Cyanophyceae) occurred in great portions and the tap water had been damaged causing concern about the odor in early June of 1982, 1983, 1987, 1989, and 1990. The relationship between the abundance of P. tenue and water quality in the south basin and the weather condition of Lake Biwa were examined. The changes of water quality in the south basin of Lake Biwa in early June of 1980-1993 showed that DIN (dissolved inorganic nitrogen) and DIN: DIP (dissolved inorganic phosphorus) ratio were comparatively low and TN (total nitrogen): DIN and TP (total phosphorus): DIP ratios were high in the years when P. tenue occurred abnormally abundant. The comparison of each average water quality among the dominant phytoplankton in early June of 1980-1993 showed that P. tenue occurred in the waters with low DIN and DIN: DIP ratio, and high WT (water temperature), TN: DIN and TP: DIP ratios. The species occurred in the years with the weather conditions of high air temperature and solar radiation, and low rain fall (precipitation) from 21 May to 10 June, before it become dominant. These features of P. tenue were remarkably contractive as compared with those of Uroglena americana, with the exception of TP: DIP ratio.																			0021-5392					NOV	1996	62	6					872	877																WOS:A1996WA03900003

Isotopic evidence for hydrologic change related to the westerlies in SW Patagonia, Chile, during the last millennium	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The Southern Hemisphere westerly winds influence the spatial distribution of precipitation in southern South America and play a significant role in the global carbon cycle, yet little is known about how this important atmospheric circulation feature has varied in the past. Here, we present a sediment core record of late Holocene variability from Lago Guanaco, a small closed-basin lake located in Torres del Paine National Park, Chilean Patagonia. The park is located in the core of the modern wind field and variations in the intensity of the atmospheric circulation directly influence the hydrology of this region. We combine stable isotopic measurements of biogenic carbonate and bulk organic matter to identify two periods of increased evaporation between 900-550 and similar to 400-50 calendar years before present (cal yr BP). The first interval is coincident with the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) while the more recent period is broadly coincident with the timing of the Little Ice Age (LIA). During the LIA interval, we observe simultaneous monotonic increases in the delta O-18 of biogenic carbonate and Nothofagus dombeyi-type pollen, which we interpret as indicative of significant changes in the intensity of the southern westerlies during the last millennium. The isotopic and palynological variations in the Guanaco record are coincident with geochemical variations found in an Antarctic ice core record from Siple Dome, suggesting that the signal preserved in Lago Guanaco is regional rather than local, and that the LIA intensification was accompanied by a poleward shift in the southern margin of the westerlies. In addition, we interpret four periods of increased lake productivity centered on 900, 650, 500, and 200 cal yr BP from simultaneous increases in the delta C-13 of bulk organic material and biogenic carbonate. These increases in lake productivity are most likely tied to increases in summer temperatures. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Stephen, D; Balayla, DM; Collings, SE; Moss, B				Stephen, D; Balayla, DM; Collings, SE; Moss, B			Two mesocosm experiments investigating the control of summer phytoplankton growth in a small shallow lake	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Mesocosm experiments were carried out to examine the relative importance of top down (fish predation) and bottom up (nutrient addition) controls on phytoplankton abundance in a small shallow lake, Little Mere, U.K., in 1998 and 1999. These experiments were part of a series at six sites across Europe. 2. In the 1998 experiment, top-down processes (through grazing of large Cladocera) were important in determining phytoplankton biomass. The lack of plant refugia for zooplankton was probably important in causing an increasing chlorophyll a concentration even at intermediate fish density. Little Mere normally has abundant macrophytes but they failed to develop substantially during both years. Bottom-up control was not important in 1998, most probably because of high background nutrient concentrations, as a result of nutrient release from the sediments. 3. In 1999 neither top-down nor bottom-up processes were significant in determining phytoplankton biomass. Large cladoceran grazers were absent even in the fish-free enclosures, probably because dominance of cyanobacteria and high phytoplankton biomass made feeding conditions unsuitable. As in 1998, bottom-up control of phytoplankton was not important, owing to background nutrient concentrations that were even higher in 1999 than in 1998, perhaps because of the warmer, sunnier weather. 4. The differing outcomes of the two experiments in the same lake with similar experimental designs highlight the importance of starting conditions. These conditions in turn depended on overall weather conditions prior to the experiments.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				DEC	2004	49	12					1551	1564		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2004.01298.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2004.01298.x													WOS:000225316100004
J	Franzoni, S; Pelizzari, C				Franzoni, Simona; Pelizzari, Cristian			Rainfall option impact on profits of the hospitality industry through scenario correlation and copulas	ANNALS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH												This work introduces and empirically tests an option contract designed to manage rainfall risk of hospitality firms. It contributes to the literature on weather derivatives in tourism. We deal with a rainfall option designed to compensate for the lack of revenues caused by too much rain, which could have a negative impact on the hospitality industry business performances in the medium/long run. We concentrate on the typical question of pricing a rainfall option. We introduce a new model with the aim of improving the formulation of the price by considering the highly non-linear relationships between rain and business performances in a multidimensional framework. Such a model results from the integration of three essential elements: scenario correlation, copulas, and Monte Carlo techniques. The model is complemented by an experiment that focuses on Lake Garda, Italy, one of the most important tourist destinations in the summer period for international and Italian visitors. We consider the quantities of rainfall of Lake Garda in the years 2005-2014 and the business performances of 18 hotels operating there during the same period. Based on these data, we obtain multidimensional data. Then, the price of an option contract designed to hedge the decrease in revenues due to rainfall is assessed based on the refined and linked multidimensional data. Finally, an optimal number of contracts to be bought is suggested based on the minimization of the Earnings Before Interests and Taxes variability.

This is especially true of exotic dreissenid mussels which are associated with decreased abundance of native macroinvertebrates and changes in food availability for fish. Beginning in 2001, we added a benthic macroinvertebrate survey to the USGS-Great Lakes Science Center's annual fall prey fish assessment of Lake Huron to monitor abundance of macrobenthos. Mean abundance of Diporeia, the most abundant benthic taxon in Lake Huron reported by previous investigators, declined greatly between 2001 and 2007. Diporeia was virtually absent at 27-m sites by 2001, decreased and was lost completely from 46-m depths by 2006, but remained present at reduced densities at 73-m sites. Dreissenids in our samples were almost entirely quagga mussels Dreissena bugensis. Zebra mussels Dreissena polymorpha were virtually absent from our samples, suggesting that they were confined to nearshore areas shallower than we sampled. Loss of Diporeia at individual sites was associated with arrival of quagga mussels, even when mussel densities were low. Quagga mussel density peaked during 2002, then decreased thereafter. During the study quagga mussels became established at most 46-m sites, but remained rare at 73-m sites. Length frequency distributions suggest that initial widespread recruitment may have occurred during 2001-2002. Like other Great Lakes, Lake Huron quagga mussels were associated with decreased abundance of native taxa, but negative effects occurred even though dreissenid densities were much lower. Dreissenid effects may extend well into deep oligotrophic habitats of Lake Huron. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Long-term experimental warming reduces soil nematode populations in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY												Climate models predict significant future warming in polar regions. In the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica. projected summer climate warming is expected to increase snow and glacial melt, resulting in higher stream discharge, rising lake levels, and an increase in areas of moist soil. but the potential influence of warming and associated changes in hydrology on the soil ecosystem is poorly understood. To examine the effects of soil warming and changes in the availability of liquid water on populations of soil invertebrates and their habitat, we established a full-factorial warming and water addition experiment at one experimental site in each of the three hydrologic basins of Taylor Valley, Antarctica, and measured responses over 8 years. We hypothesized that an increase in temperature and moisture together would enhance habitat suitability for soil invertebrates thereby increasing abundance, biomass and diversity of the soil animal communities. Instead, warming treatments had an overall negative effect on density and body size of the microbial-feeding nematode Scottnema lindsayae, the dominant animal in the dry valleys, which decreased by 42% in warmed plots. While experimental moisture additions as a single annual pulse had no effect on nematodes, the surface flooding of one site from rapid melting of upslope subsurface ice (the result of an unusual natural warming event) drastically altered soil moisture, salinity, and animal communities; mortality of S. lindsayae increased and densities decreased. This extreme soil wetting event also resulted in an increase in chlorophyll a and populations of Eudorylaimus spp, a nematode species that prefers moist to wet habitats and feeds on soil micro-algae. Our results suggest that warming in the dry valleys could significantly affect soil nematode populations and species composition both directly and indirectly by altering species-specific habitat suitability for soil biota.

J	Avlijas, S; Mandrak, NE; Ricciardi, A				Avlijas, Suncica; Mandrak, Nicholas E.; Ricciardi, Anthony			Effects of substrate and elevated temperature on the growth and feeding efficiency of an invasive cyprinid fish, Tench (Tinca tinca)	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Research has linked ecologically-damaging invasive animals to a suite of traits including rapid rates of growth and exploitation of food resources, but such traits can vary substantively across habitats. In this study, the growth rate and functional response of tench (Tinca tinca), a benthivorous Eurasian fish invading the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River basin, were measured when exposed to treatment combinations of two physical habitat variables: substrate (rocks versus sand) and temperature (18 vs 26 degrees C, the latter being within the range of maximum mean summer nearshore temperatures projected for the lower Great Lakes under climate warming). In spite of their reported preference for fine-sediment habitat, tench did not exhibit impaired rates of consumption, or growth, on rocks compared to sand. Although tench require vegetated fine-sediment habitat for spawning, their efficient foraging on coarse substrate suggests that behavioural plasticity contributes to their ability to rapidly colonize large heterogeneous waterbodies. Furthermore, tench functional response shifted from a stabilizing Type III to a de-stabilizing Type II as temperature increased from 18 to 26 degrees C. Climate warming could thus erode the ability of prey to exploit refugia against tench predation, possibly resulting in significant local declines in prey populations and enhanced competition for food resources with native benthivorous fishes. Our results provide insight into the influence of physical habitat conditions on the foraging efficiency of this global aquatic invader. Experimental comparisons of invader performance under different environmental contexts offer a valuable tool for informing risk assessment.

Multi-core investigation of a lotic bay of Lake of the Woods (Minnesota, USA) impacted by cultural development	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												The freshwater Zippel Bay (Minnesota, USA), from its headwaters to its outlet on Lake of the Woods, a larger lake, was identified as a degraded system because of augmented nutrient and sediment loads, and for low oxygen affecting aquatic life. Anthropogenic impacts were purportedly from stressors including agriculture, urban development and hydrologic modifications, so paleolimnology using multiple indicators was employed in the bay and its two primary tributaries to characterize long-term trends since European settlement of the region. Isotope analyses of the sediment cores indicated notable shifts in sedimentation rates in response to human activities, and the application of a new diatom-based nutrient model to fossil diatom assemblages indicated that phosphorus levels have approximately doubled over the last similar to 50 years. While Zippel Bay appears to be naturally eutrophic, increased nutrient loads have resulted in significant algal blooms, particularly during late summer. The multiple-core approach revealed that anthropogenic activities upgradient of the two tributaries varied in their contributions to aquatic degradation in Zippel Bay, and that despite the close proximity of the cores, there has been notable spatial variation in water quality. This research also further validates the application of traditional freshwater paleolimnological methods to lotic systems with sufficient sedimentary regimes. This study has important implications for Zippel Bay as it quantifies the extent of limnological impacts and underlines the need for remediation.

Strain HSL-3(T) grew optimally in the presence of 2-10% (w/v) NaCl. Strain HSL-3(T) showed poor growth in the absence of NaCl and grew in the presence of less than 23% NaCl. The cell wall peptidoglycan type of strain HSL-3(T) was A4beta based on L-Orn-D-Asp. The predominant menaquinone found in strain HSL-3(T) was menaquinone-7 (MIK-7). Strain HSL-3(T) had a cellular fatty acid profile containing large amounts of branched fatty acids; the major fatty acids were anteiso-C-15:(0), iso-C-15:0 and iso-C-16:0. The DNA G + C content of strain HSL-3(T) was 45 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rDNA sequences showed that strain HSL-3(T) falls within the radiation of the cluster comprising Halobacillus species. Strain HSL-3(T) exhibited levels of 16S rDNA similarity of 97.4-98.4% to the type strains of Halobacillus species. Levels of DNA-DNA relatedness between strain HSL-3(T) and the type strains of all validly named Halobacillus species were in the range 7.3-9.2%. On the basis of phenotypic and phylogenetic data and the genomic distinctiveness, strain HSL-3(T) (= KCCM 41590(T) = JCM 11546(T)) should be placed in the genus Halobacillus as the type strain of a novel species, for which the name Halobacillus salinus sp. nov. is proposed.																			1466-5026					MAY	2003	53		3				687	693		10.1099/ijs.0.02421-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1099/ijs.0.02421-0								12807188					WOS:000183268200009
J	Dickens, AF; Gélinas, Y; Hedges, JI				Dickens, AF; Gélinas, Y; Hedges, JI			Physical separation of combustion and rock sources of graphitic black carbon in sediments	MARINE CHEMISTRY					Symposium on New Approaches in Marine Organic Biogeochemistry held in Honor of the Life and Science of John I Hedges	AUG 28-30, 2003	Univ Washington, Friday Harbor Lab, San Juan Isl, WA		Univ Washington, Friday Harbor Lab			In order to discriminate between graphitic black carbon (GBC) from different sources, we separated surface sediments from two contrasting environments according to size and density and analyzed the fractions for GBC. In Lake Washington, an urban lake, over 70% of the GBC was in the two lightest fractions (<2.0 g/cm(3)), and over half the GBC was smaller than 3 Inn, suggesting that most of the GBC in this lake is light, small combustion-derived soot-black carbon (BC). In contrast, over 70% of the GBC from the Washington Coast sediment fell into the two heaviest fractions (>2.0 g/cm(3)), and 70% was silt-sized (3-63 mum). These data suggest that Washington Coast Slope GBC is dominated not by combustion-derived soot but by mineral-associated carbon, probably weathered out of continental rocks, and support previous research suggesting that petrogenic graphite is the source of this carbon (Dickens, A.F., Gelinas, Y., Masiello, C.A., Wakeham, S., Hedges, J.I., 2004. Reburial of fossil organic carbon in marine sediments. Nature 427 336-339). Based on the physical separation of the two types of GBC, we estimate that the Lake Washington GBC contains similar to73% soot-BC, whereas the Washington Coast GBC is similar to70% rock-derived GBC. The evidence for two different sources of sedimentary GBC indicates that this pool of carbon is not a homogenous subfiraction of BC, and caution must be used when interpreting the results of this and other BC analyses. The different physical properties of the two GBC subfractions suggest that they will follow different distribution pathways in the environment. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

J	Colhoun, EA; Pola, JS; Barton, CE; Heijnis, H				Colhoun, EA; Pola, JS; Barton, CE; Heijnis, H			Late Pleistocene vegetation and climate history of Lake Selina, western Tasmania	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Analysis of pollen, NRM intensity of sediments, and dating of a 397 cm core from Lake Selina in western Tasmania provides a detailed record of vegetation and climate changes for the Last Interglacial-Last Glacial cycle. The vegetation record shows that cool temperate rainforest was present during Isotope Substage 5e and during the Holocene. Wet montane forest and subalpine shrublands dominated the early Last Glacial interstades; subalpine-alpine heathlands and herbfield the stadials. Stages 4-2 mainly had grassland, herbland and heath vegetation. There is close correlation between phases of maximum magnetic intensity in the sediments with pollen zones indicating presence of herbaceous vegetation. This suggests erosion of the catchment was greater in the absence of forest or woodland. Climate may have been slightly cooler than present during Substage 5e but the evidence is not definitive. Climate was colder at all times during the Last Glacial Stage until after ca. 14 kyr BP. Maximum temperature depression from present during Stage 2 was >3.5 degrees C at Lake Selina, but probably as much as 6.5 degrees C in the West Coast Range. Holocene climate was cool and wet. Comparison of the Lake Selina record, with others in western Tasmania and Victoria, indicate that variations in vegetation during the Last Interglacial-Last Glacial cycle were primarily responses to temperature changes in western Tasmania, and to precipitation changes, particularly summer drought, in western Victoria.

J	Johnson, DW; Susfalk, RB; Dahlgren, RA				Johnson, DW; Susfalk, RB; Dahlgren, RA			Nutrient fluxes in forests of the eastern Sierra Nevada mountains, United States of America	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												Soil nutrient contents and fluxes in semiarid lodgepole (Pinus contorta [Dougl.]) and jeffrey pine (P. jeffreyi [Grev. and Balf.]) stands of the eastern Sierra Nevada mountains are described and compared to those in the Integrated Forest Study sites [Johnson and Lindberg, 1992]. These Sierran forests, like others in the southwestern United States, have very low N, S, and H+ fluxes compared to more humid forests. Base cation fluxes in these Sierran forests are high relative to more humid forests, however, reflecting the high base status of the soils, inputs from nearby desert systems, and high rates of soil weathering. Soil C and N contents in these Sierran forests are low compared to those in more humid forests, probably because of lower primary productivity and more frequent fire. Soil extractable P pools in these Sierran forests vary by 2 orders of magnitude and are strongly influenced by parent material. As in most snow-dominated systems, pulses of NO3- are released from the melting snowpack each spring in the Sierran forests. Nitrogen released from melting snowpack is retained in the soil in most cases, but there are substantial springtime pulses of NO3- in stream waters during dry years. Budget calculations indicated that N losses during fire (both wildfire and prescribed fire) and N gains associated with postfire N-fixing vegetation are an order of magnitude greater than N inputs and outputs via solution phase.

Samples from the Shikotsu, Kuttara and Daisen volcanoes in Japan were taken from pyroclastic flows (both welded and non-welded) and a pumice fall deposit. One of the two New Zealand rocks is a rhyolite lava from the Taupo Volcanic Zone. Four sites out of seven located on rocks that are not usually subjected to Thellier's experiment yielded successful results, which indicates that volcanic products such as pyroclastic flows and rhyolite lavas are as good a material as basalt and andesite lavas for application of the paleointensity experiment. One paleointensity from New Zealand at 9.9 ka is very large, at about 100 muT, and provides support for the paleointensity high found in Europe and Japan [1,2]. The other four paleointensities for 14-22 ka are smaller than the present-day value, and this agrees with the idea of a broad paleointensity minimum for the period 10-50 ka that was suggested by McElhinny and Senanayake [3]. It is also noted that the variation curve of absolute paleointensity from the volcanic rocks is reasonably similar to the relative paleointensity curves from marine and lake sediments which were summarized by Tauxe [4].																			0012-821X					MAR	1994	122	1-2					29	42		10.1016/0012-821X(94)90049-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0012-821X(94)90049-3													WOS:A1994NE75700003

Bernhart			The Green River salt mystery: What was the source of the hyperalkaline lake waters?	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												Bicarbonate-rich source waters were needed to form the largest sodium carbonate evaporite deposits in the geologic record, the early and middle Eocene Green River trona (NaHCO3 center dot Na2CO3 center dot 2H(2)O) in the Bridger basin, Wyoming, and nahcolite (NaHCO3) in the Piceance Creek basin, Colorado. Large modern and Pleistocene trona deposits are associated with magmatic activity and Na+-HCO3- -rich hydrothermal inflow waters, either within the depositional basin (Lake Magadi, Kenya) or at great distances (Searles Lake, California). No evidence exists for magmatic sources of CO2 near the Green River Formation. Several regional volcanic centers were active 300 km or more to the north, but drainage reconstructions show that waters from these areas did not discharge into the Green River Formation lakes during evaporite deposition. Alternatively, Na+ -HCO3- -rich waters could have drained northwestward from the Colorado Mineral belt to the Bridger basin via the proposed Aspen River. A river originating in the Colorado Mineral belt (Sawatch uplift) could also have provided source waters to the Piceance Creek basin. Field evidence, however, has not yet documented these flow paths, and specific Eocene volcanic centers and hydrothermal source areas have yet to be identified. Other explanations for the elevated alkalinities needed to form thick sodium carbonate evaporites include accelerated silicate mineral weathering rates during a period of high atmospheric pCO(2) and Eocene warmth. Amplified chemical weathering may explain the cluster of sodium carbonate evaporites in the USA and China that are Eocene in age. Another possible source of alkalinity to the Green River lakes is fault-controlled upward migration of a deep sedimentary source of CO2. The large amount of organic matter preserved in the evaporitic Wilkins Peak and Parachute Creek Members raises the possibility that decay of organic matter in Green River lakes could have added sufficient CO2 and alkalinity to produce waters capable of precipitating trona and nahcolite, although such degradation of organic matter has not created hyperalkalinity in modern lakes.

Total community DNA was extracted from each of four discrete layers EPRDS-1, -2, -3 and -4 (from top to bottom) and 16S rDNA were amplified by PCR. Cluster analysis of DGGE profiles revealed that the bacterial communities shifted sharply between EPRDS-1 and EPRDS-2 in similarity coefficient at merely 49%. Twenty-three sequences retrieved from DGGE bands fell into 11 groups based on BLAST and bootstrap analysis. The dominant groups in the bacterial communities were Chloroflexi, Gamma proteobacteria, Actinobacterium and unidentified bacteria, with their corresponding percentages varying along discrete layers. Pairwise Fst (F-statistics) values between the archaeal clone libraries indicated that the archaeal communities changed distinctly between EPRDS-2 and EPRDS-3. Sequences from the archaeal libraries were divided to eight groups. Crenarchaea Marine Group I (MGI) was prevalent in EPRDS-1 at 83%, while Uncultured Crenarchaea group II B (UCII B) abounded in EPRDS-4 at 61%. Our results revealed that the vertically stratified distribution of prokaryotic communities might be in response to the geochemical settings and suggested that the sampling area was influenced by hydrothermalism. The copresence of members related to hydrothermalism and cold deep-sea environments in the microbial community indicated that the area might be a transitional region from hydrothermal vents to cold deep-sea sediments.

The phosphorus load was reduced by 90% in 1970-1973 and a fertilizer factory on the lake decreased its N-outlet by 80%. The phosphorus concentrations in the water decreased by up to 40% and the total nitrogen concentration by 50% between 1970 and 1983. But in one part of the lake the N-concentration increased by 50% due to drainage from surrounding land and atmospheric deposition. With changes in the ratios of N/P and Si/P as well as the turbidity of the water there have been drastic alterations in species composition and total phytoplankton biomasses. There was a rise in the number of species over the period of study at all times of the year. Colonial species decreased while small and large flagellates of chrysophytes, cryptomonads and dinoflagellates increased. In the most polluted basins cyanobacterial blooms have halved their peak biomasses or have almost disappeared. At times during the 19 years of the study the summer phytoplankton communities have been tested to fits of a log-normal distribution, assuming such a distribution to be valid in well-balanced ecosystems. The general trend indicates an increasing adjustment to a log-normal distribution. Phytoplankton changes in the lake are associated with effects known to cause reversed eutrophication, although climatically induced variations may also be identified.																			0007-1617					JUN	1987	22	2					193	208		10.1080/00071618700650241	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00071618700650241													WOS:A1987H681500012

Most Kinneret fish and macro-invertebrates use littoral habitats for at least part of their life cycle. Many use littoral resources (substrate for attachment, refuge, food) for reproduction and growth. Higher species diversity and fish abundance and biomass are associated with higher degree of habitat complexity. Water level fluctuations (WLFs) influence the availability of littoral resources, with impacts not only on the littoral fauna and flora but indirectly also on the pelagic populations. Consecutive years of drought and a negative water balance for Lake Kinneret result in low lake levels and exposure of continuously increasing shore areas on which shore vegetation develops. The shore vegetation is inundated in high-rainfall winters, presenting a window of opportunity for the littoral zone biota that takes advantage of the temporarily augmented vegetative resources (e.g., enhanced reproduction of cichlids; refuge for young of the year of many fish species). Upon drawdown of the lake water levels, the proportion of rocky littoral declines, limiting the biota that dwell in this habitat. Correspondingly, littoral biota flourish on years of high water levels when rocky habitats are abundant. For example, fluctuation of population size of the endemic cyprinid Mirogrex (syn: Acanthobrama) terraesanctae, a major planktivore, was directly influenced by the availability of freshly inundated rocky substrate used for spawning. In a cascading effect, the pelagic zooplankton populations were impacted by the resulting fluctuations in Mirogrex population size and in their predation pressure. The case of Lake Kinneret underscores the importance of WLFs that can act as a major environmental factor influencing littoral habitat structure and resources, and resulting populations dynamic. Intensification of these fluctuations beyond their natural amplitude is likely to markedly impact the lake ecosystem structure and function.																			1573-4595	2543-005X	978-94-017-8944-8; 978-94-017-8943-1				2014	6						517	532		10.1007/978-94-017-8944-8_29	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-8944-8_29	10.1007/978-94-017-8944-8												WOS:000459771400030

MERGE hosts original proposals to the IPY and facilitates their funding. MERGE selected three key questions to produce scientific achievements. Prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms in terrestrial, lacustrine, and supraglacial habitats were targeted according to diversity and biogeography; food webs and ecosystem evolution; and linkages between biological, chemical, and physical processes in the supraglacial biome. MERGE hosted 13 original and seven additional proposals, with two full proposals. It respected the priorities and achievements of the individual proposals and aimed to unify their significant results. Ideas and projects followed a bottom-up rather than a top-down approach. We intend to inform the MERGE community of the initial results and encourage ongoing collaboration. Scientists from non-polar regions have also participated and are encouraged to remain involved in MERGE. MERGE is formed by scientists from Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, Poland, Russia, Spain, UK, Uruguay, USA, and Vietnam, and associates from Chile, Denmark, Netherlands, and Norway.

Nyiragongo in the Virunga volcanic region (DRC)	JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION												Chemical composition of rainwater is strictly related to atmosphere scavenging. Active degassing volcanoes release acid gases and solid particulate in the surrounding environment. Nyiragongo Volcano (DRC) is characterized by a high degassing activity from an active lava lake hosted within the crater. Chemistry of rainwater in the area is clearly dependent on the influence of the volcanic plume, especially at the rim of the Nyiragongo summit crater. Rainwater collected from this zone has pH values as low as 2, high salinity (EC 28-1800 mu S/cm), and high contents of F- and Cl- (up to 193 and 270 ppm, respectively), NH4+ (up to 146 ppm) and SO42- ions (up to 340 ppm) relative to worldwide rainwater. The chemical composition of rainwater after interaction with the volcanic plume tends to shift towards the condensable fraction of fumarolic fluids discharged from the summit crater. Rainwater acidified by the volcanic plume also removes metals from particulate suspended in the atmosphere, thus undergoing metal enrichment. Displacement of the Nyiragongo volcanic plume by predominantly westward-directed wind causes "natural" contamination of rainwater collected for drinking purposes in villages located on the western flank of the volcano. Rainwater falling in urban centers located S-SE of the Nyiragongo Volcano is not usually affected by the rain-plume interactions which strictly depends on wind directions. However, areas of possible contamination by the volcanic plume might create a further emergency and critical situations on top of an already existing severe humanitarian crisis. Rainwater is the principal drinking water supply in the Nyiragongo area, thus the geochemical monitoring of rainwater quality is of great importance to mitigate the hazard of natural contamination of this fundamental resource for the local communities.

J	Peralta, R; Timani, B; Das, R				Peralta, Richard; Timani, Bassel; Das, Rudolf			Optimizing Safe Yield Policy Implementation	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												The presented method enhances groundwater-mandated safe yield management. It is useful for settings that prevent sustained yield or integrated management. To protect hydraulically connected surface water rights, the Utah government's Cache Valley groundwater management plan proposes that total pumping increase not exceed 84,431 m(3)/day. To determine how best to spatially distribute additional allowable pumping, stakeholders quantified limits defining acceptable impacts on selected water resource indicators. A new simulation-optimization (S-O) algorithm used these limits while computing optimal spatially distributed perennial yield or safe yield groundwater pumping extraction strategies. The limits prevent unacceptable decreases in: head and net flow between aquifer and surface waters (rivers, surface/subsurface drains, springs, lakes). The optimization objective function maximizes weighted pumping to provide water for 18 growing municipalities. For 16 perennial yield scenarios, computed optimal pumping increases differ in protectiveness toward senior water rights, and range from 16% to 103% of the state plan-proposed increase. Implementing a protective strategy would achieve 90% of the storage changes needed to reach equilibrium within 23 years. Indicator potentiometric heads would reach equilibrium within 10-40 years. At equilibrium, an optimal Cache Valley perennial yield strategy acceptably minimizes net annual non-pumping discharges. By comparison, multi-period 20-year transient groundwater mining optimizations allow more pumping in early years. Pumping then must decline to satisfy seepage and head constraints through year 20. Adverse seepage impact would increase for years thereafter. For situations governed by safe or perennial yield policy, equilibrium-based (steady-state) optimization is very useful. It effectively develops optimal perennial yield strategies.																			0920-4741	1573-1650				JAN	2011	25	2					483	508		10.1007/s11269-010-9710-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-010-9710-0													WOS:000286324200005

Environmental archives (such as lake sediments) record fallouts deposited on lake and terrestrial surfaces during ancient mining and smelting activities. However, very few is known about the potential buffering effect of soils upon which metal falls out, prior to be released through runoff and or/erosion, hence leading to pervasive contamination fluxes long after the ceasing of metallurgical activities. Here we aim at assessing this long-term remobilisation in a mountainous catchment area. Lake sediments and soils were collected 7 km upward a 200-year-old historic mine. The Pb\\Ag mine of Peisey-Nancroix was operated between the 17th and the 19th centuries with a documented smelting period of 80 years. In lake sediments, the total Pb content varies from 29 mg.kg-1 prior smelting to 148 mg.kg-1 during ore smelting. Pb isotopes in lake sediments and soils provide evidence of anthropogenic Pb from the local ore (206Pb/207Pb = 1.173; 208Pb/206Pb = 2.094) during and after smelting, suggesting anthropogenic Pb remobilisation for 200 years. The accumulation rates of anthropogenic Pb calculated in lake sediments after the smelting period confirm such a remobilisation. Despite a decrease in this accumulation rate through time, soils still contain significant stocks of anthropogenic Pb (54-89 % of PbANTH). The distribution of present-day anthropogenic Pb in the catchment area depends mainly on topographic characteristics. Coupling lake sediments and soils investigations is thus necessary to constrain the long-term persistence and remobilisation of a diffuse contamination related to mining activities.

The reconstructed July air temperatures at Krakenes rise to 10.5 degrees C soon after deglaciation, are about 11.5 degrees C in the Allerod, decrease to 9.5-10 degrees C in the Younger Dryas, and rise rapidly within 15 yrs to 11.5 degrees C at the onset of the Holocene. There is a two-step rise to 13 degrees C or more in the early-Holocene. The likely over-estimation of Younger Dryas temperatures and under-estimation of early-Holocene temperatures probably result from the limited temperature range represented by the existing calibration set. The data set is currently being expanded to include lakes with warmer air temperatures (> 14 degrees C) and with colder air temperatures (< 8 degrees C).					Birks, John/C-3103-2008; Birks, H.

Within-lake habitat heterogeneity mediates community response to warming trends	ECOLOGY												Climate change is rapidly altering many aquatic systems, and life history traits and physiological diversity create differences in organism responses. In addition, habitat diversity may be expressed on small spatial scales, and it is therefore necessary to account for variation among both species and locations when evaluating climate impacts on biological communities. Here, we investigated the effects of temperature and spatial heterogeneity on long-term community composition in a large boreal lake. We used a five-decade time series of water temperature and relative abundance of fish species captured in the littoral zone throughout the summer at 10 discrete locations around the lake. We applied a spatial dynamic factor analysis (SDFA) model to this time series, which estimates the sensitivity of each species to changing water temperature while accounting for spatiotemporal variation. This analysis described the trend in community composition at each sampling location in the lake, given their different trends in temperature over time. The SDFA indicated different magnitude and direction of species responses to temperature; some species increased while others decreased in abundance. The model also identified five unique trends in species abundance across sites and time, indicating residual dynamics in abundance after accounting for temperature effects. Thus, different regions in the lake have experienced different trajectories in community change associated with different rates of temperature change. These results highlight the importance of considering habitat heterogeneity in explaining and predicting future species abundances, and our model provides a means of visualizing spatially-explicit temporal variation in species' dynamics.					; Thorson, James/O-7937-2014	Hovel, Rachel/0000-0002-3452-9485; 													0012-9658	1939-9170				SEP	2017	98	9					2333	2342		10.1002/ecy.1944	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.1944								28664599					WOS:000408836600012
J	MOLONGOSKI, JJ; KLUG, MJ				MOLONGOSKI, JJ; KLUG, MJ			ANAEROBIC METABOLISM OF PARTICULATE ORGANIC-MATTER IN THE SEDIMENTS OF A HYPEREUTROPHIC LAKE	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												The anaerobic decomposition of particulate organic matter (POM) was examined in the anoxic pelagic sediments of hypereutrophic Wintergreen Lake [Michigan, USA]. Degradation of sedimented POM occurred rapidly as shown by increased production and release of ammonia, H2S, volatile fatty acids and methane from the sediments 2-3 wk after large inputs of organic matter. Maximum concentrations of most metabolites were found at the sediment-water interface, indicating that the initial anaerobic degradation of freshly deposited POM occurred at this site. The absence of the inorganic electron acceptors, nitrate and sulfate, indicated that fermentation and methanogenesis were the major anaerobic processes involved in the dissimilation of organic matter in these sediments during stratified periods. The amount of C input converted to CH4 in the sediments was determined from May to early Nov. 1976 and 1977. C output as CH4 was measured by quantifying CH4 lost from the sediments by ebullition and by estimating soluble CH4 lost to the water column by diffusion. Total CH4 release during summer stratification accounted for 34% of the particulate organic C input to the sediments in 1976 and 44% in 1977. CH4 release was directly related to the rate of sedimentation of POM. CH4 production was temporarily inhibited following high rates of sedimentation in 1976, suggesting that the rate of organic loading may be an important factor controlling anaerobic decomposition in these sediments.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1980	10	6					507	518		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1980.tb01225.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1980.tb01225.x													WOS:A1980KT41800003
J	Smith, RJ				Smith, RJ			Status of the Lacs des Loups Marins Harbour Seal, Phoca vitulina mellonae, in Canada	CANADIAN FIELD-NATURALIST												The Lacs des Loups Marins Harbour Seal (Phoca vitulina mellonae) is a subspecies that occurs in the area of Lacs des Loups Marins (Lower Seal Lakes) (56 degrees N, 73-74 degrees W), 160 km east of Hudson Bay, on the Ungava peninsula of. northern Quebec. With the possible exception of Lake Iliamna, Alaska, it is the only known Harbour Seal population that is resident in freshwater Year-round. Written references to the unique appearance and behaviour of this seal dale back to 1818. The subspecies was described primarily on the basis of its unique morphology and presumed long-lime geographic isolation from neighbouring oceanic Harbour Seals. Estimates of the population's size are imprecise, and range from 100 to 600 animals. Little is known of the seals' habitat requirements other than that they seem to feed exclusively in freshwater, and are likely reliant on some specific environmental features such as under-ice air pockets to sustain them through the winter. Pupping seems to take place substantially earlier (mid-April to mid-May) than in other Harbour Seal populations at similar latitudes. The only known cause of human-induced mortality is occasional hunting by aboriginal peoples. Phoca vitulina mellonae is potentially vulnerable because of its small population size, restricted ranee, and susceptibility to disturbance.																			0008-3550					APR-JUN	1997	111	2					270	276																WOS:A1997XJ31500015
J	Hayward, RS; Arnold, E				Hayward, RS; Arnold, E			Temperature dependence of maximum daily consumption in white crappie: Implications for fisheries management	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Maximum daily consumption (C-max) by adult white crappies Pomoxis annularis (164-532 g live weight) provided ad libitum rations of prey fish was determined at 18, 21, 24 and 27 degrees C. Observed increases in C-max between 18 and 24 degrees C followed by a sharp (two-thirds) decline at 27 degrees C indicated that a low to negative physiological ''scope for growth'' exists for white crappies at 27 degrees C and above. Examination of temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO) profiles from numerous Missouri impoundments for May-August 1991 suggested that white crappies were forced to occupy water of 27-32 degrees C (warm water) in 40% of these impoundments by early June and 85% by early August. White crappies were forced into warm water in only a slightly lower percentage of the deep (>5 m) impoundments we examined than in shallow (less than or equal to 5 m) ones. Evaluation of year-to-year differences (1988-1991) in time periods when white crappies were forced to occupy warm water in Lake Pomme de Terre, Missouri, showed that range (15-64 d) and time of occurrence varied substantially. Our findings suggest that the warm and annually variable summer temperature and DO regimes of many U.S. impoundments may substantially underlie the slow growth rates and among-year variation in size structure and recruitment that are characteristic of crappie populations in these environments.																			0002-8487					JAN	1996	125	1					132	138		10.1577/1548-8659(1996)125<0132:TDOMDC>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1996)125<0132:TDOMDC>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1996TP35000014

The integration of sedimentary facies, elemental and isotopic geochemistry, and biological proxies (diatoms, chironomids and pollen), together with a robust chronological control, provided by AMS radiocarbon dating and Pb-210 and Cs-137 radiometric techniques, enabled precise reconstruction of the main phases of environmental change, associated with the Medieval Warm Period (MWP), the Little Ice Age (LIA) and the industrial era. Shallow lake levels and saline conditions with poor development of littoral environments prevailed during medieval times (1150-1300 AD). Generally higher water levels and more dilute waters occurred during the LIA (1300-1850 AD), although this period shows a complex internal paleohydrological structure and is contemporaneous with a gradual increase of farming activity. Maximum lake levels and flooding of the current littoral shelf occurred during the nineteenth century, coinciding with the maximum expansion of agriculture in the area and prior to the last cold phase of the LIA. Finally, declining lake levels during the twentieth century, coinciding with a decrease in human pressure, are associated with warmer climate conditions. A strong link with solar irradiance is suggested by the coherence between periods of more positive water balance and phases of reduced solar activity. Changes in winter precipitation and dominance of NAO negative phases would be responsible for wet LIA conditions in western Mediterranean regions. The main environmental stages recorded in Lake Estanya are consistent with Western Mediterranean continental records, and show similarities with both Central and NE Iberian reconstructions, reflecting a strong climatic control of the hydrological and anthropogenic changes during the last 800 years.

Gray wolf range in the western Great Lakes region under forecasted land use and climate change	ECOSPHERE												Land use and climate change alter species distributions worldwide, and detecting and understanding how species ranges shift can facilitate conservation planning and action. Following extirpation from most of the contiguous United States, gray wolves (Canis lupus) have partially recolonized former range in the western Great Lakes region, but it is unknown how land use and climate change may alter amounts of wolf habitat. Using wolf observation data collected during winters 2017-2020 in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan, we created ensemble models to predict how land use and climate change may affect the amount of wolf habitat within these states. A projection model for the western Great Lakes region suggested three of four scenarios of land use and climate change will lead to 9%-35% increases in wolf habitat, while a solely climate-based projection model supported our expectation that changes in climate, in isolation, will have limited effect on current wolf range. Our results support stable or increasing amounts of wolf habitat in the western Great Lakes region during the 21st century, suggesting limited or no adverse effects on the current distribution or further recolonization of wolves. Our findings can inform policy development regarding wolf conservation and identify areas where recolonization is plausible, thus where promoting human-wolf coexistence is most pertinent.

Fourteen elements were measured in 500 particles of each by SEM-EDX. The main components were clay, quartz, calcite, and sulfur. The mineral aerosol compositionally resembled loess. X-Y plots of SiO2 versus SO3 and Al2O3 revealed a central core of clay, with lines radiating outward toward quartz, calcite, salts, and alumina. The core represented externally mixed clay particles, and the lines represented internally mixed clays and other components. Externally mixed particles ( mostly clays) amounted to 65% of the total in DS, 60% in DL, and 50% in NDS. Saline minerals contributed considerable amounts of S, P, and Cl, especially in DS and DL, and could have come from dried salt lakes or saline soils in northern China and southern Mongolia. The strongest correlations of the 14 elements measured were within these salts, not within the aluminosilicate elements. Most Ca existed as calcite in DS and DL, but as CaSO4 in NDS. S was very abundant in many of the particles in NDS, while a few of these were unambiguously pollution S in DS. High CuO and Al2O3 were found in Duolun, probably from nearby pollution sources. Dust storm aerosol can interact with pollution gases and pollution aerosol during transport to Beijing, although such interactions appear to require longer transport times to observe. SEM photos showed that calcite could serve as a substrate for adsorbing SO2 or sulfuric acid and ammonium sulfate and allowing them to react and produce gypsum or mixed sulfates.

Middle Turonian dinosaur paleoenvironments in the Upper Cretaceous Kaskapau Formation, northeast British Columbia	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												The Kaskapau Formation is a mudstone-dominated wedge up to 950 m thick that spans late Cenomanian to middle Turonian time. The formation has a prominent wedge geometry and was deposited in the foredeep of the Western Canada Foreland Basin. In outcrop in northeast British Columbia, nearshore sandstones are locally well developed and include rare wedges of nonmarine strata. On Quality Creek, near Tumbler Ridge, 11 m of nonmarine strata contain abundant dinosaur tracks and the first in situ dinosaur bone reported from British Columbia. This site, at a paleolatitude of about 67 degrees N, preserves a rare glimpse of Turonian terrestrial environments during global eustatic highstand. Three main dinosaur habitats are recognized: strandplain and beach-ridge; freshwater lake; and brackish lagoon. Back-beach sandstone has a relief of about 2.5 m, interpreted as beach ridges; sandy coals containing abundant dinosaur tracks represent inter-ridge slough deposits. Overlying lake deposits comprising laminated muds with freshwater molluscs grade up into rooted muddy siltstone and locally, dinoturbated sandstone. Lake deposits are capped by lagoonal mudstone with abundant brackish-water molluscs, locally including a dinosaur-trampled oyster bioherm. The upper parts of sandy lagoonal deltas are pervasively dinoturbated. Sandstone filling a tidal channel contains logs, oyster shells, and bones of dinosaurs, turtles, and crocodiles, as well as fish scales. The lagoonal succession is erosively overlain by offshore sandy mudstones. Various lines of evidence suggest that the mean annual temperature at this sea-level location was about 14 degrees C, with a cold-month mean no less than 5.5 degrees C. The high-latitude location implies a significant period of winter darkness, and correspondingly diminished plant productivity.																			0008-4077	1480-3313				JUN	2006	43	6					631	652		10.1139/E06-014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/E06-014													WOS:000239654900001
J	Bjune, AE				Bjune, AE			Holocene vegetation history and tree-line changes on a north-south transect crossing major climate gradients in southern Norway - evidence from pollen and plant macrofossils in lake sediments	REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY												Long-term tree-line fluctuations have been studied using pollen and plant macrofossils preserved in take sediments from three sites on an oceanic to continental transect in southern Norway. After deglaciation the early Holocene vegetation developed from an open pioneer herb-dominated vegetation into dwarf-shrub heath with shrubs, which was soon colonised by Betula and later also by Pinus sylvestris at the two lower sites. Maximum tree-line altitudes occurred in the early-to mid-Holocene. P sylvestris reached 100-150 m higher than at present in continental areas, and 35-100 m higher on the west coast during the Holocene. Betula pubescens grew at altitudes that today reach 1300 m a.s.l. in Jotunheimen and 800 m a.s.l. in western Norway. The Pinus forest was at the two southwestern sites mixed with Betula and Alnus was closer to the sites between 8500 and 7500 cal years BP. A shift from mixed pine-birch woodland to birch woodland is seen from ca. 4300 cal years BP with the development of a sub-alpine birch belt followed by further recession of the birch forest. On the west coast, birch dominated only during the last 500-1000 years. Further decrease of woodland and opening of the landscape in the last 2000 years occurred due to climatic change and human impact such as sheep and cattle grazing. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

For the exploration of the specific characteristics of the benthic chlorophyll, photosynthesis examinations were made in the most characteristic and dominating benthic plant community of Lake Velence [Hungary] in the Vaucheria stand. Of the methods measuring photosynthesis, the dark and light bottle method was applied with O2 indication. Based on investigations in Lake Velence in the summer of 1973, the productivity parameters of the V. dichotoma mat are as follows: PO2 = 1.76 mg O2 Dm g-1 h-1; PC = 0.56 mg C Dm g-1 h-1; daily gross production value = 3.29 gC m-2 d-1. For the benthic assimilation number of chlorophyll (AN) the value 0.24 was obtained, while the activity factor appeared as 0.01. It is characteristic of the benthonic eutrophication that the sessile vegetation has a considerable quantity of biomass, a great quantity of chlorophyll, a low productivity, a small value of assimilation and a similarly small photosynthetic activity factor.																			0001-5350						1976	22	3-4					381	391																WOS:A1976EL66900008

However, they have never been found to dominate the phytoplankton in the northern part of the invaded area. The aim of our study was to expand the understanding of the invasion process in Nostocales, by answering the question which environmental conditions enabled the first ever noted bloom incident of C. raciborskii and S. aphanizomenoides in the northern part of their current occurrence ranges. We examined the population dynamics of the two invasive cyanobacteria and the abiotic conditions in which their blooms developed in a reservoir at 52 degrees N. We also examined the phytoplankton community diversity and composition before and during the invasive species blooms. As shown by redundancy analysis, the competitive advantage of S. aphanizomenoides depended strongly on high water temperature and high concentration of phosphates, and was positively related to other summer conditions (low water transparency, high ammonium nitrogen concentration). C. raciborskii biomass was not related to temperature and phosphates, but we argue that high water temperature in the first half of July enabled abundant akinete germination, and pulsed phosphorus availability synergized to bring about a later bloom. Both the invasive species co-occurred with the native cyanobacterium Aphanizomenon gracile, but C. raciborskii bloomed after the native species domination period. The results of the study corroborate the high competitiveness of S. aphanizomenoides in hot, nutrient-rich conditions, and the adaptation of the invaders to the environment in the invaded regions, inter alia by the overwintering mechanism of numerous akinete differentiation. Our results also contradict the assumption that the phytoplankton diversity index would decrease after colonization of freshwater bodies by invasive cyanoprokaryotes.					; Budzyńska, Agnieszka/AAC-6860-2020; Gołdyn, Ryszard/J-1093-2018	Goldyn, Ryszard/0000-0001-8325-5161; Budzynska, Agnieszka/0000-0003-4983-1940; 													1322-0829	1440-1835				OCT	2017	65	4					322	332		10.1111/pre.12188	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pre.12188													WOS:000412099200007

Aquatic microfossil and pollen assemblages from the 'Reinsdorf sequence', likely correlated to Marine Isotope Stage 9, document environmental changes from a thermal maximum to succeeding glacial conditions recorded in two sequences of excavation sites 12 II and 13 II. Multi-proxy analyses enable detailed reconstruction of lake-shore and landscape developments despite variable microfossil preservation in changing carbonate- and organic-rich deposits. Rich aquatic vegetation with abundant charophytes suggests repeated phases with water depths of 0.5-2 m at site 13 II, while even greater temporary depths are deduced for 12 II DB. Mesorheophilic and mesotitanophilic ostracod species indicate stream inflows with medium-low calcium contents of >18 mg Ca L-1 originating from nearby springs. Diatoms point to meso-eutrophic conditions and an alkaline pH of the lake water. Interglacial conditions with thermophile forests but no aquatic microfossils preserved, suggesting a dry or only temporarily flooded site, mark the beginning of the sequence. Continuous presence of aquatic organisms and overall dominance of small tychoplanktonic diatoms during a subsequent cool steppe phase provide evidence for increased water depths and unstable habitats characterized by erosion and probably prolonged periods of lake ice cover. During the succeeding boreal forest-steppe phase, surface runoff into the productive, shallow lake decreased due to a more extensive vegetation cover. Concurrently, intensified groundwater input in contact with the nearby salt wall caused elevated salinities. Following a lake level drop, stream inflows and lake levels increased again towards the end of the Reinsdorf sequence and promoted development of a diverse fauna and flora at the lake shore; thereby maintaining an attractive living and hunting environment for early humans during a phase of generally cooler temperatures and landscape instability at the transition into a glacial period.

J	Thorn, VC				Thorn, VC			Phytolith evidence for C4-dominated grassland since the early Holocene at long pocket, northeast Queensland, Australia	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Preliminary phytolith analysis of ephemeral lake fill sediment at Long Pocket, near Toomba, northeast Queensland, Australia, indicates that a C4-dominated grassland with a minor woody component has been present in the region since ca. 8000 cal yr B.P. Based on the modem distribution of C4 and C3 native grasses in Australia, this suggests that mean summer temperatures of at least 14 degreesC (ca. 10 degreesC cooler than present) were maintained since the early Holocene. This interpretation is comparable with previous studies, which together imply that the establishment of C4-dominated grasses in central and northeast Australia occurred between the last glacial maximum (most likely after ca. 16,000 C-14 yr B.P.) and ca. 7200 C-14 yr B.P. (ca. 8000 cal yr B.P.). Taxonomic composition of the grassland appears relatively consistent since the early Holocene at Long Pocket and includes phytoliths comparable with those from modem Arundinoideae, Panicoideae, and Chloridoideae. Rare non-grass phytoliths are also present. A gradual decrease in abundance of saddle phytolith forms (attributed to Chloridoideae grasses) from the base of the record at ca. 6500-7000 cal yr B.P. suggests decreasing aridity throughout the Holocene.

J	Jackson, TA; Nguyen, N; Li, WC				Jackson, Togwell A.; Nguyen, Nien; Li, Wan-Chi			Effects of Copper, Nickel, and Sulfate from the Smelters at Sudbury, Ontario (Canada) on Microbial Communities in Lakes	GEOMICROBIOLOGY JOURNAL												Analysis of water and sediments from deep and shallow environments in lakes located 6-154km east or southeast of the smelters at Sudbury, Ontario (Canada) revealed variable, interactive effects of copper, nickel, and sulfate from smelter fallout on lacustrine microfloras. Metal species in sediments were differentiated by sequential extractions, and the nature, abundances, and activities of microbial populations were represented by chlorophyll-a in water and by CO2 production, fatty acids, phospholipids, dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, and spectral properties of humic matter in sediments. Smelter fallout declined logarithmically with distance from the smelters, and its effects on microfloras depended on the type of microorganism or microbial process and on environmental factors and the abundances of metal species and detoxifying agents. Extractable copper and nickel had toxic effects, which were not attributable solely to the exchangeable fractions, but in certain cases nickel counteracted copper toxicity. Sedimentary sulfide as a whole or sulfide produced by bacterial sulfate reduction, or low oxidation-reduction potential regardless of sulfide concentration, ameliorated metal toxicity by making the metals less bioavailable; and toxicity showed a quantum jump when detoxifying agents fell below certain critical concentrations, implying the existence of threshold levels of bioavailable metals above which toxicity increased abruptly. In some cases metal toxicity was lowest in the lakes closest to the smelters (because sulfate concentrations were highest) as well as in the lakes furthest away, and was highest at intermediate distances. The results also suggest that nickel pollution led to ecological succession whereby nickel-tolerant microbial populations replaced nickel-sensitive ones.																			0149-0451	1521-0529					2017	34	5					400	420		10.1080/01490451.2016.1204375	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01490451.2016.1204375													WOS:000400019900002

Despite this, there are few opportunities for oncology providers to learn about complementary or alternative therapies, while at the same time there is a high demand for integrative oncology (IO) training. To address a gap in IO educational opportunities, and particularly for nonphysicians, we created the Integrative Oncology Scholars (IOS) Program. The program's goal is to train 100 IO leaders and facilitate partnerships between them and complementary practitioners. Design: Four iterations of a year-long National Cancer Institute-funded educational program that combines in-person team-based learning and eLearning to teach the evidence, application, and philosophy supporting IO. Settings: In-person sessions take place at the University of Michigan, and eLearning is implemented using a Canvas website (Instructure, Inc., Salt Lake City, UT). Subjects: Nurses, social workers, physician assistants, psychologists, physicians, pharmacists, and physical/occupational therapists with active oncology practices. Educational intervention: Four cohorts of 25 oncology providers per year will learn the evidence base for complementary and alternative approaches to a wide number of oncology topics, including symptom control, dietary supplements commonly used by cancer patients, diet, and the utility of specific integrative approaches for common oncology side-effects such as fatigue. Outcome measures: A mixed methods approach will be used to evaluate overall IOS Program progress and individual scholar's impact on IO research, education, and clinical endeavors. Results: The first cohort of 25 IOS has been recruited and their education will begin in Summer 2018. Scholars come from 13 states and represent 23 different healthcare systems. Conclusions: The IOS Program has the potential to increase the number of trained IO providers, educators, and researchers in the United States.

Downstream changes in bed-sediment and streamwater metal concentrations along a watercourse in a rehabilitated post-industrial landscape in south wales	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Over 250 years of metal smelting in Swansea (South Wales) left metal-rich slag across the Nant-y-Fendrod valley floor and aerial metal pollution over the wider landscape. Reclamation since 1965 included: (1) partial removal of spoil, flattening the rest and capping it with topsoil, (2) culverting watercourses and creation of two flood-relief lakes and (3) revegetation of the aerially polluted landscape. This paper assesses downstream changes along the Nant-y-Fendrod stream-lake system in metal levels of (a) fine bed-sediment and (b) streamwater and seepages. In the upper, 'aerial-pollution zone' total Zn, Cu, Pb and Cd in surface bed-sediment increase marginally within the first lake to 892, 207, 212 and 7.2 mg/kg, respectively. Farther downstream, Cu and Pb rise sharply, and Zn and Cd progressively, to 12,853, 595, 871 and 155 mg/kg, respectively, as the stream traverses the 'capped metal-rich waste zone.' Zn and Cd reach 22,671 and 229 mg/kg, respectively, in the second lake, before falling 35-56% below its outlet. Streamwater metal levels rise (but seepage metal concentrations remain stable) in most storm events, though patterns (including whether levels are reduced downstream of the lake) vary with antecedent conditions. Possible interactions between seepages, bed sediment and streamwater metal dynamics are explored.

J	Pentecost, A; Bayari, S; Yesertener, C				Pentecost, A; Bayari, S; Yesertener, C			Phototrophic microorganisms of the Pamukkale travertine, Turkey: Their distribution and influence on travertine deposition	GEOMICROBIOLOGY JOURNAL												The travertines at Pamukkale contain a diverse assemblage of phototrophs: 17 species of cyanobacteria, 16 diatoms, and 5 Chlorophyceae. Two communities were recognized on the active travertines: (I) surficial mats dominated by filamentous cyanobacteria, particularly Lyngbya (Phormidium) laminosum forming soft weakly mineralized layers to 10 mm thick, and (2) a predominantly endolithic assemblage, also dominated by cyanobacteria developing 2-5 mm below the travertine surface. The distribution of these communities is determined largely by water flow and the degreee of desiccation Two further communities are briefly described from nondepositing areas. Most of the active travertine consists of alternating layers of micrite and sparite 0.25-0.75 mm in thickness, which probably result from short-term fluctuations in water flow rather than diel events (photosynthesis, temperature). The presence of needle-fiber calcite in surface samples suggests that evaporation of water may play some part in travertine formation. The phototrophs appear to influence the travertine fabric only locally, where the surficial growths contain strings of calcite crystals adhering to the filaments, forming irregularly laminated layers. The hot-spring water is believed to be contaminated with sewage and agricultural effluent, but there was no evidence to suggest that this is currently affecting the travertine deposits. The water is supersaturated with respect to calcite when it contacts the travertine, and precipitation is primarily the result of carbon dioxide evasion. Water chemistry and discharge measurements indicate a total travertine deposition rate of 35 tonnes per day.

In La Grande 2 and Opinaca reservoirs and in the Boyd-Skami diversion, catch per unit of effort (CPUE) practically tripled during the first years after impoundment, to gradually decrease at levels slightly higher than those observed during pre-impoundment. In Caniapiscau reservoir, CPUE decreased during the first years following impoundment, but reached a maximum nine years later (1991). Year class strength suggests that reproductive success was maximal during the creation of La Grande 2 and Opinaca reservoirs, thus contributing to the subsequent increase in CPUE. Local changes in abiotic and biotic conditions at some of the sites sampled probably caused movements of fish, thus contributing to the observed increase in CPUE. Lake whitefish CPUE (La Grande 2 and Opinaca reservoirs) and year class strength (Opinaca only) correlated positively with zoo-plankton biomass; however, no correlation was found with winter water levels. Lake whitefish growth rates and condition increased after impoundment, to return to nearly initial values during later years; rates of change of these parameters varied in the three reservoirs.

J	WILSON, SE; WALKER, IR; MOTT, RJ; SMOL, JP				WILSON, SE; WALKER, IR; MOTT, RJ; SMOL, JP			CLIMATIC AND LIMNOLOGICAL CHANGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE YOUNGER DRYAS IN ATLANTIC CANADA	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												Pollen, diatom and chironomid fossils from the sediments of a core from Brier Island Bog Lake, Nova Scotia were studied in an attempt to relate changes in microfossil composition to a climatic cooling in Atlantic Canada correlative with the European Younger Dryas ca. 10 to 11 ka. Our paleolimnological data were then compared to similar types of data from Splan Pond, New Brunswick to determine if there were any significant differences between a coastal and a more inland site. Nonarboreal pollen was dominant throughout the Brier Island core and the interval 10.0-11.0 ka did not show the typical decline in Picea and increases in tundra-like vegetation characteristic of many sites in Atlantic Canada. However, the limnological indicators did undergo marked changes in taxon composition. The chironomid assemblage was initially dominated by shallow-water, warm-adapted chironomid taxa followed by abundant Sergentia (a cold stenotherm) during 10-11 ka. Sergentia disappeared in the ''post Younger Dryas'' interval and the warm-adapted genera resumed dominance. Chironomid-inferred paleotemperature reconstructions revealed that at both Brier Island Bog Lake and Splan Pond, summer surface-water temperatures dropped abruptly to between 13 and 17-degrees-C during the 10-11 ka interval, suggesting that a cooler climate was present in Atlantic Canada correlative with the European Younger Dryas. Diatom assemblage changes during the same period corroborate the occurrence of limnological fluctuations.					; Smol, John/A-8838-2015	Smol, John/0000-0002-2499-6696; 													0930-7575	1432-0894				MAR	1993	8	4					177	187		10.1007/BF00207964	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00207964													WOS:A1993KQ36200002

During the last decade, the lake's status has undergone a drastic shift from clear water dominated by submerged macrophytes to turbid water dominated by phytoplankton. The canonical correspondence analysis showed that four environmental variables explained the significant variation in the macroinvertebrate species composition: submerged plant biomass, bottom sediment organic matter content (OMC), distance from the mouth of the Takkobu River, and bottom-layer pH. Five species of Chironomidae [Chironomus sp. (except plumosus group), Psectrocladius sp., Corynoneura sp., Parachironomus sp. arcuatus group, and Zavreliella sp.] occurred in sites with relatively lower pH and a high submerged plant biomass, whereas three species of Tubificidae (Tubifex tubifex, Aulodrilus limnobius and Aulodrilus sp.) and two of Chironomidae (Nanocladius sp. and Monodiamesa sp.) occurred in sites with high pH and little vegetation. The three Tubificidae species also preferred organic-rich sediments. Irrespective of aquatic vegetation, Sphaerium sp. (Bivalvia) and Monodiamesa sp. (Chironomidae) occurred in low-OMC sites, whereas Tanypus sp. (Chironomidae) preferred high-OMC sites. The number of macroinvertebrate taxa showed the highest correlation with the number of submerged plants, suggesting that macroinvertebrate species richness was related mostly to submerged plant species diversity in this lake. The quantity and species richness of submerged plants and OMC are thus important determinants of the community structure of macroinvertebrates inhabiting sediments in Lake Takkobu.

J	Thomas, M; Richardson, C; Durbridge, R; Fitzpatrick, R; Seaman, R				Thomas, Mark; Richardson, Carole; Durbridge, Regina; Fitzpatrick, Rob; Seaman, Russell			Mobilising citizen scientists to monitor rapidly changing acid sulfate soils	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA												Drought culminating in 2009 in the Murray-Darling Basin put severe downstream pressure on Lakes Alexandrina and Albert ("Lower Lakes") in South Australia. Falling water levels caused sulfidic acid sulfate soils (ASS) to dry forming sulfuric ASS (pH<4) in lakebeds, along with environmental, economic and public health concerns. The pace of sulfuric ASS spread overwhelmed scientific efforts to develop robust hydrogeochemical models for the best management decisions. Meanwhile, community impatience grew because of fears for livelihoods, public health and loss of recreational amenity and exacerbated by apparent slow pace of government response caused by lagging scientific support. Responding to the looming problems, government, community and scientists joined in a citizen science project. The project comprised a programme of community ASS education, training and a field sampling programme conducted over four intervals (August 2009-June 2010). The project attracted 84 volunteers who sampled 51 survey areas covering the full range of ASS. The citizen scientists allowed a wider geographic and temporal sampling reach than was otherwise possible by scientists alone. The citizen scientists amplified the work of scientists by adding to the pool of data and freeing scientists to concentrate on non-routine ASS work. Perhaps of more enduring importance, the project showed how community, government and scientists can cooperate at times of environmental stress. The experience has grown government's capability to implement policy to grow community resilience during environmentally stressful episodes. Finally, the Lower Lakes community is now positioned for the next drought because community knowledge, leadership and networks are now in place.

J	Wazbinski, KE; Quinlan, R				Wazbinski, Kristin E.; Quinlan, Roberto			Midge (Chironomidae, Chaoboridae, Ceratopogonidae) assemblages and their relationship with biological and physicochemical variables in shallow, polymictic lakes	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												We explored the relationship of aquatic midge assemblages with physicochemical and biological environmental gradients to assess which variables may govern the distribution of midge larvae in 47 shallow, polymictic lakes across New Jersey and New York State (NJ/NY) in the United States of America. Subfossil taxa collected from surficial sediments (0-1cm sediment depth), comprising 50 taxa from 47 lakes, were analysed in conjunction with environmental variables using multivariate statistical techniques. Alkalinity, maximum depth, surface area, total phosphorus and pH were identified as significant and ecologically relevant variables that explained the most variation in the midge assemblage across NJ/NY. Lake trophic state was the main driver for midge distributions in NJ/NY lakes. Biological gradients, such as per cent macrophyte cover or algal productivity (as chlorophyll a concentration), did not explain a significant portion of the variation in midge community composition. The addition of chaoborid larvae to ordinations strengthened the relationship between midge community structure and bottom oxygen concentration in NJ/NY lakes. Our results confirm that complex species-environment relationships in shallow, polymictic lakes create challenges for assessing midge assemblages along a particular environmental gradient, independently of other environmental conditions. However, it may still be possible to develop palaeolimnological inference models using midge remains to assess general historical patterns of disturbance for NJ/NY and other polymictic lakes, provided it is understood that midge-based inferences integrate some covariation in changes along several environmental gradients.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				DEC	2013	58	12					2464	2480		10.1111/fwb.12223	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12223													WOS:000326021800003

We studied the spatial distribution of C. raciborskii in western Poland and the environmental variables related to its occurrence near the border of its current temperate geographical range. We also identified the typical phytoplankton assemblages in which C. raciborskii occurs. Forty-six lakes were sampled once during the summers of 2008 and 2009. C. raciborskii was present in 43% of the samples and its biomass accounted for 0.1-13.9% of the total phytoplankton biomass found in the lakes. A General Linear Model (GLM) analysis and t-tests showed that the lakes in which C. raciborskii occurred were significantly shallower, more turbid and more eutrophic than the lakes from which it was absent. Redundancy Analysis (RDA) and GLM analyses showed that C. raciborskii biomass correlated positively with total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and conductivity. It correlated negatively with temperature, ammonium (NH4+) and orthophosphate (PO43-). According to Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA), C. raciborskii often co-occurred with Aphanizomenon ovalisporum, which is rarely observed in the studied region (common in subtropical regions, like C. raciborskii), rather than with the more common A. aphanizomenoides or the native A. gracile. Moreover, Planktothrix agardhii, the most common species in the studied region, was weakly associated with C. raciborskii. Overall, C. raciborskii was frequently present in the temperate lakes of western Poland, but it was most abundant in eutrophic lakes with high conductivity and high concentrations of TN and TP but low concentrations of NH4+ and PO43-.					; Soininen, Janne/A-4205-2008	Soininen, Janne/0000-0002-8583-3137; 													0967-0262	1469-4433					2012	47	1					12	21		10.1080/09670262.2011.645216	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09670262.2011.645216													WOS:000301924700002

Understanding the swelling characteristics of a shield tunnel in expansive soil is important. However, most in-site experiences on the swelling characteristics of a tunnel are obtained from the NATM tunnels constructed in swelling rock using drill and blast method; most laboratory experiments or theoretical analyses on the swelling characteristics of a shield tunnel in expansive soil are under certain hypotheses which have not been verified in actual situation. To solve the problems, the Slender West Lake tunnel was selected as the background, laboratory and in-site experiments were performed to understand the swelling characteristics of a shield tunnel in expansive clay. Four experimental sections were constructed in the actual tunnel. The measuring gauges were pre-installed in the segments in factory and the segments were installed in-site to observe the actual earth pressure and temperature during construction. The influences of expansive soil to the distributions and variations of earth pressure, bending moment, and temperature were analyzed. The increasing earth pressure was divided into three stages. Large earth pressure was detected at the top, bottom, left, and right sides of the tunnel. The earth pressure at the left and right sides was larger than that at the top and bottom. Large negative bending moment was detected at the top and bottom of the tunnel, whereas large positive bending moment was detected at the left and right sides of the tunnel. The minimum bending moment appeared at 45A degrees oblique. The largest negative bending moment was larger than the largest positive bending moment. Based on the observations, a load mode of swelling pressure for a beam-spring model was suggested. It can be referred by the similar tunnels.

The model output is calibrated against available geodetic MB for Gangotri Glacier System and validated with satellite-derived snow line altitudes (SLAs) for Gangotri Glacier. Gangotri and Meru glaciers show mean mass wastage of -0.88 +/- 0.31 m w. e. a(-1) (meter water equivalent per year) and 0.17 +/- 0.29 m w. e. a(-1), respectively whereas the mass budgets of fragmented tributary Chaturangi and Raktavaran glaciers are positive with the mean values of 0.49 +/- 0.17 m w. e. a(-1), and 0.62 +/- 0.15 m w. e. a(-1), respectively over 1979-2020. Gangotri Glacier's tongue is covered by thick debris having several supra-glacial lakes and ice cliffs (considered as melting hotspots); therefore, despite the presence of thick debris, we assume the melting over this area as of a clean glacier. The whole Gangotri Glacier System shows a moderate wastage of 0.27 +/- 0.25 m w. e. a(-1). The positive MBs of the Raktavaran and Chaturangi glaciers are due to their high area-elevation distribution and heavily debris-covered tongues. The positive MBs on these fragmented tributary glaciers are due to non-climatic topographic reasons and should not be misunderstood as climate change deniers or compared with Karakoram Anomaly. Modelled MBs are most sensitive to the threshold temperature for melt. The altitudinal MB sensitivities to all model parameters become negligible above 6,200 m a.s.l.

Holocene evolution of diatom and silicoflagellate paleoceanography in Slocum Arm, a fjord in southeastern Alaska	MARINE MICROPALEONTOLOGY												Diatom and silicoflagellate assemblages in cores EW0408-47JC, -47TC, -46MC (57 degrees 34.5278' N, 136 degrees 3.7764' W, 114 m water depth) taken from the outer portion of Slocum Arm, a post-glacial fjord in southeastern Alaska, reveal the paleoclimatic and paleoceanographic evolution of the eastern margin of the Gulf of Alaska (GoA) during the past 10,000 years. Between similar to 10 and 6.8 cal ka, periods of low salinity and cool water conditions alternated with brief intervals marked by the increased influx of oceanic, more saline and likely warmer waters. Increased surface water stability characterized by a middle Holocene interval between similar to 6.8 and 3.2 cal ka is typified by increased abundances of northeastern Pacific Thalassiosira spp. that are indicative of spring coastal blooms and decreased abundances of warm and higher salinity oceanic diatoms. At similar to 3.2 cal ka, an abrupt increase in both the relative contribution of oceanic diatoms and silicoflagellates suggestive of cooler upwelling conditions occurred in the -47JC record. A stepwise increase in alkenone sea surface temperature in northern GoA core EW0408-85JC and increase in southern sourced precipitation in the carbonate 6180 record of Jellybean Lake (Yukon) present evidence that this similar to 3.2 cal ka event coincided with the onset of enhanced positive Pacific Decadal Oscillation like (PDO) conditions in the GoA. These positive PDO-like conditions persisted until similar to 1.0 cal ka and were followed by high amplitude fluctuations in the relative abundance of diatom and silicoflagellate assemblages.

J	KRIEGER, KA				KRIEGER, KA			BENTHIC MACROINVERTEBRATES AS INDICATORS OF ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION IN THE SOUTHERN NEARSHORE ZONE OF THE CENTRAL BASIN OF LAKE ERIE	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The benthic macroinvertebrates of the central basin of Lake Erie were sampled with a Ponar grab in the summers of 1978 and 1979 along a 155-km reach of the nearshore zone (.ltoreq. 12 km offshore) in Ohio, USA, at depths of less than 20 m. The major groups and their most abundant species were, in order of overall abundance, Oligochaeta (Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri, L. cervix-L. claparedeianus group, L. maumeensis), Sphaeriidae (Pisidium casertanum, P. henslowanum, Sphaerium corneum, Musculium transversum) and Chironomidae (Procladius sp., Chironomus spp.). The average abundance of oligochaetes in the harbors was 21,000 individuals m-2 in 1978 and 12,700 m-2 in 1979, compared with 1500 m-2 and 1200 m-2, respectively, in the areas outside of harbors. Comparison of the macrobenthic assemblages with those in other regions of the Great Lakes, using several numerical indices as well as indicator species distributions, indicated that the general area of the nearshore zone outside of harbors possesses a moderate degree of organic enrichment, with a gradient of decreasing pollution in an offshore direction. The harbors appeared to be severely degraded, as reflected by the high densities of oligochaetes and the almost complete absence of all but the most pollution-tolerant species. The documentation of species distributions will enable future assessments of changes in the nearshore benthic communities.

We show that the lake water isotopic composition predominantly reflects the isotopic composition of the precipitation. Superimposed on a general depletion trend of 3.5parts per thousand over the past 5000 years we found that the isotopic composition of precipitation became depleted ( > 1parts per thousand excursions) during four occasions centered at 4400, 3000, 2000, and after 1200 cal yr BP. Climate simultaneously sustained a positive glacier mass balance, that Caused the catchment glacier to advance. A persistent change in the atmospheric circulation pattern could potentially have caused the registered changes in delta(18)O(diatom) because different air masses hold characteristic delta(18)O signatures of their precipitation. The glacier mass balance primarily responds to the influence of summer temperature oil ablation. We suggest that the most likely cause For the recorded changes in both these proxies is a steadily increasing but fluctuating dominance of colder and delta(18)O depleted air masses from the north/northeast during the past 5000 years. The delta(18)O(diatom) depletion and glacier events all occur at times of relative ice-rafted-debris maxima in the North Atlantic, consistent with cold conditions and changes in surface wind directions. Our results confirm that changes towards a predominance of north/northeasterly winds occurred at these time intervals. (C)2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Diedrich, KE; Loso, MG				Diedrich, Katie E.; Loso, Michael Gregg			Transient impacts of Little Ice Age glacier expansion on sedimentation processes at glacier-dammed Iceberg Lake, southcentral Alaska	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Iceberg Lake, a glacier-dammed proglacial lake in southern Alaska, contains a 1,500+ year varve record complicated by a history of episodic lake-level changes associated with fluctuations in ice-dam thickness and position. To better understand the basinwide glaciolacustrine response to late Holocene climate variability, we collected five cores from two areas in the lake, including a previously unexamined deepwater area distal from inlet streams. Based on eight AMS C-14 dates, and correlations among our cores and previously documented outcrops, we describe similar to 1,000 years of stratigraphy from each area. Deposition at both areas was dominated by fine-grained varves, but cores from the distal area uniquely contain coarser deposits, including rhythmites and graded sand beds, that we attribute to deposition of a subaqueous outwash fan-delta between similar to 1250 and 1650 AD. We attribute this event to thickening of the impounding glacier and consequent incursion of the glacier margin, and an associated lateral moraine, into the lake. This result suggests an early onset of the Little Ice Age (LIA) glacial advance in this region. Changes in basinwide circulation and sedimentation associated with this event probably caused minor thickening of varves used previously to reconstruct summer temperatures, reducing sensitivity of that record to early LIA cooling. The basinwide impact of this event illustrates the potentially significant spatial and temporal variability of lacustrine sedimentary processes in dynamic glacial landscapes.

J	Gophen, M				Gophen, M			Lake kinneret (Israel) ecosystem: Long-term instability or resiliency?	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												The Kinneret ecosystem has undergone significant man-made modifications. These include, among others: construction of the south dam (1932); drying of Hula Lake and swamps (1950s); salty springs diversion (1964); lake water salinity decline from 395 (1961) to 210 ppm chlorid; deepening of the Jordan River near Bnot-Yaacov bridge (1971) with consequent high loads of suspended matter; National Water Carrier (NWC) operation (1964); sewage removal and fishpond restriction in the catchment; implementation of the Hula Project (1994-1998); introduction of native and exotic fishes; an amplitude of water level fluctuations of 4.8 m. Natural fluctuations occurred as well: heavy floods with high nutrient loads in 1968/69 and 1991/92 and droughts in 1973, 1989-1991 and 1998-1999; 4.6 m water level fluctuations; low temperatures (12.3 degrees C) and fish kill in 1971/72 and 1991/92; no mixing period in 1984; low (1975, 1996-1997) and high biomass of Peridinium (1994, 1998); N-2-fixing cyanobacterium bloom (1994, 1995); high stock of Lavnun (Acanthobrama) fishes (1990s); zooplankton biomass decline (1969-1993) and increase afterwards. Although man made changes and natural environmental changes were significant, the lake ecosystem did not deviate from the level of resilient fluctuations and the classification of long-term instability in Lake Kinneret is probably an overestimation. In this paper I use long-term (31 years) distribution data of plankton, nutrients, and water level in Lake Kinneret to distinguish between resiliency and instability.																			0049-6979	1573-2932				OCT	2000	123	1-4					323	335		10.1023/A:1005214128353	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1005214128353													WOS:000089881000027

Quantifying regional effects of best management practices on nutrient losses from agricultural lands	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) losses from agricultural areas have degraded the water quality of downstream rivers, lakes, and oceans. As a result, investment in the adoption of agricultural best management practices (BMPs) has grown, but assessments of their effectiveness at large spatial scales have lagged. This study applies regional Spatially Referenced Regression On Watershed-attributes (SPARROW) models developed for the Midwest, Northeast, and Southeast United States to quantify potential regional effects of BMPs on nutrient losses from agricultural lands. These models were used because they account for specific BMPs in the prediction of instream nutrient loads. The BMPs included in the models were cover crops, no-till, and conservation tillage. Sensitivity testing for the BMPs on agricultural nutrient loads was done using simulations that varied the intensity of BMPs specified in each region. When the BMP intensity was increased 50% relative to the 2012 intensity, the predicted agricultural load of total P decreased across all regions (4% to 14%). The predicted reduction in average P yields in the Midwest, Northeast, and Southeast was 706, 544, and 26 kg km(-2), respectively. Increasing BMPs by 50% decreased predicted agricultural total N loads by 3.5% in the Southeast but increased predicted N loads in the Midwest and Northeast by 4.7% and 1.8%, respectively. Model-predicted average N yields increased by 402 kg km(-2) and 302 kg km(-2) in the Midwest and Northeast, respectively, and decreased in the Southeast by 329 kg km(-2). In model simulations, cover crops were more effective at reducing N and P loads than the tillage BMPs despite lower intensity of implementation in 2012. However, at the regional scale of this investigation, implementation of BMPs result in only moderate predicted effects on agricultural nutrient loads.																			0022-4561	1941-3300				JAN-FEB	2022	77	1					15	29		10.2489/jswc.2022.00162	http://dx.doi.org/10.2489/jswc.2022.00162													WOS:000769396600004
J	An, CC; Fan, JR; Zhang, YF; Yan, D				An, Chunchun; Fan, Jianrong; Zhang, Yanfen; Yan, Dong			Characterizing the responses of vegetation to climate change in the Tibet Plateau using remote sensing data	JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING												It is of great significance to investigate the changes in vegetation and its response to climate change in Tibet due to the sensitivity and vulnerability of the area to climate change. The spatiotemporal pattern of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and its trends between 2001 and 2015 were depicted using NDVI from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS). The responses of vegetation to climatic variables were analyzed through linear regression and correlation analysis with tropical rainfall measuring mission precipitation data and MODIS land surface temperature (LST) data. The results showed that (1) the average annual NDVI gradually decreased from the southeast to the northwest in accordance with the variations in LST and precipitation, (2) the annual NDVI increased from 2001 to 2015 at a rate of 0.3 x 10(-3) per year. The LST exhibited an average annual increase of 0.05 degrees C while precipitation remained relatively stable, (3) the correlation between NDVI and precipitation was positive in the central region, whereas it became negative in the southeast and northeast. The correlation between NDVI and LST was opposite of that between NDVI and precipitation, and (4) the increases in NDVI in the tropical monsoon rain forest and rain forest, subalpine coniferous forest, and alpine meadow vegetation types in the southeast depended more on LST than precipitation. In contrast, the increases in NDVI responded strongly to precipitation in the alpine bush and meadow, alpine grassland, alpine desert, and alpine desert steppe vegetation types in the northwest.

J	Plaut, I; Afik, D				Plaut, I; Afik, D			Effect of salinity acclimation on routine activity rate in two closely related species of blennies from different habitats	ISRAEL JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												The freshwater blenny, Salaria fluviatilis, and the marine peacock blenny, S. pave, are closely related and can survive in both freshwater acid seawater. Salaria fluviatilis is widespread in rivers and lakes in the vicinity of the Mediterranean basin, including Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee), and S. pave is distributed in rocky parts of the Mediterranean coast. This study investigated the effect of salinity acclimation on routine activity level. Fish were acclimated for three months in 0%, 40%, and 100% seawater mixed with 100%. 60%. and 0% dechlorinated tap water (<2, 14.4, and 36 ppt sea salt, respectively). The fish were then placed in aquaria equipped with IR beam projectors and detectors set up to count their activity level in the different salinities under a photoperiod of 14:10 L:D. S. pave demonstrated a simple daily rhythm of activity, being active during the light phase, whereas S. fluviatilis was also active in the light phase. but demonstrated a bimodal activity pattern. In both species, activity decreased during the acclimation period. The bimodal daily activity pattern of S. fluviatilis might be a result of the daily wind regime on Lake Kinneret in summer (May-October). The activity reduction in lower or higher salinities (in relation to natural habitat) is suggested to be a tertiary stress response.																			0021-2210						2001	47	1					79	86																WOS:000168788300009

Robert			Genetic and morphological analyses indicate high population mixing in the endangered cichlid Alcolapia flock of East Africa	CONSERVATION GENETICS												Alcolapia is a minor genus of small-bodied, polymorphic cichlids inhabiting the lagoons and hot springs surrounding the soda lakes Natron (largely in Tanzania) and Magadi (Kenya). Three Alcolapia species are present at Natron (Alcolapia alcalicus, Alcolapia ndalalani and Alcolapia latilabris) and one at Magadi (Alcolapia grahami). All are IUCN Red Listed as either vulnerable or endangered. We performed analyses of morphometric and genetic structure on 13 populations of the Natron Alcolapia flock, and one A. grahami population of Lake Magadi as an out-group. Morphometric analyses revealed significant differentiation in the head and mouth shape of the species at Natron. From a genetic perspective, among 70 mtDNA control region sequences 17 haplotypes were found, showing in the minimum spanning network a star-like pattern around the widespread haplotype 2lat. At Natron, there was limited genetic differentiation between the different populations of A. alcalicus and A. latilabris, despite apparent ecological barriers of extreme alkalinity that suggested their populations were isolated. Instead, there appeared to be some population connectivity, with a rate of 0.5-2.3 migrants per generation suggesting that natural factors, such as intense rains or transmission by large piscivorous birds, facilitate population connectivity and maintain genetic similarity. The outputs of high population connectivity and one genetic unit at the basin level (despite morphological divergence) suggest that any human activities that disrupt the connectivity of the freshwater resources of the Natron catchment could further threaten the integrity and current status of these already threatened fish populations.

As the pH, conductivity, and alkalinity of water increase, greater concentrations of TFM are required to kill sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) larvae. Consequently, the concentration of TFM required for effective treatment varies among streams. Brown trout (Salmo trutta) and sea lamprey larvae were exposed to a series of TFM concentrations in a continuous-flow diluter for 12 h. Twenty five exposures were conducted at various water alkalinities and pHs that treatment personnel encounter during lampricide treatments. Survival/mortality data were analyzed for lampricide concentrations that produced 50 and 99.9% mortality (LC50 and LC99.9) for sea lamprey larvae and 25 and 50% mortality (LC25 and LC50) for brown trout. Linear regression analyses were performed for each set of tests for each selected alkalinity by comparing the 12-h post exposure LC99.9 sea lamprey data and LC25 brown trout data at each pH. Mortality data from on-site toxicity tests conducted by lampricide control personnel were compared to predicted values from the pH/alkalinity prediction model. Of the 31 tests examined, 27 resulted in the LC(100)s (lowest TFM concentration where 100% mortality of sea lamprey was observed after 12 h of exposure) falling within 0.2 mg/L of the predicted sea lamprey minimum lethal (LC99.9) range. The pH/alkalinity prediction model provides managers with an operational tool that reduces the amount of TFM required for effective treatment while minimizing the impact on non-target organisms.																			0380-1330						2003	29			1			510	520		10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70512-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70512-7													WOS:000221321300039
J	Hill, CL; Schild, R				Hill, Christopher L.; Schild, Romuald			Paleohydrology and paleoenvironments at Bir Sahara: Pleistocene lithostratigraphy and sedimentology in the southern Egyptian Sahara	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES												The Bir Sahara area contains a remarkable record of Middle and Late Pleistocene hydrologic and environmental conditions for Saharan North Africa, based on lithostratigraphic and sedimentologic evidence from basin-fill deposits. Some of the deposits contain Lower Paleolithic (Acheulean) or Middle Paleolithic artifacts that help to constrain their age, since Acheulian artifacts are assigned to the Middle Pleistocene, while Middle Paleolithic artifacts are limited to either the Middle or Late Pleistocene. Locality BS-14 is in the southern part of Bir Sahara, while localities E-88-15, E-88-2, BS-13, and BS-16 are situated in the south-central part of the defiational basin, closer to the present-day water-hole. Lowered groundwater conditions during arid intervals resulted in erosional topographic basins. These deflational basins were later filled with sediments associated with wetter hydrologic conditions. The oldest studied sedimentary sequence in the Bir Sahara depression (BS-14) contains in situ Acheulian artifacts. Acheulian handaxes are found in sands underlying carbonates that are interpreted as evidence of spring-fed pond and marsh environments during a Middle Pleistocene wet interval. At the E-88-15 locality, the stratigraphic sequence documents deposition in a possible perennial pond or small lake that varied in extent and depth and is associated with Middle Paleolithic artifacts. At E-88-12 and BS-13, lateral and vertical variations in the lithofacies of the basin-fill sediments provide additional records of changing hydrologic conditions during the Late Pleistocene. These hydrologic conditions appear to reflect variations in water table levels related to groundwater recharge and, at times, local rains. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Ji, LY; Gong, P; Geng, XR; Zhao, YC				Ji, Luyan; Gong, Peng; Geng, Xiurui; Zhao, Yongchao			Improving the Accuracy of the Water Surface Cover Type in the 30 m FROM-GLC Product	REMOTE SENSING												The finer resolution observation and monitoring of the global land cover (FROM-GLC) product makes it the first 30 m resolution global land cover product from which one can extract a global water mask. However, two major types of misclassification exist with this product due to spectral similarity and spectral mixing. Mountain and cloud shadows are often incorrectly classified as water since they both have very low reflectance, while more water pixels at the boundaries of water bodies tend to be misclassified as land. In this paper, we aim to improve the accuracy of the 30 m FROM-GLC water mask by addressing those two types of errors. For the first, we adopt an object-based method by computing the topographical feature, spectral feature, and geometrical relation with cloud for every water object in the FROM-GLC water mask, and set specific rules to determine whether a water object is misclassified. For the second, we perform a local spectral unmixing using a two-endmember linear mixing model for each pixel falling in the water-land boundary zone that is 8-neighborhood connected to water-land boundary pixels. Those pixels with big enough water fractions are determined as water. The procedure is automatic. Experimental results show that the total area of inland water has been decreased by 15.83% in the new global water mask compared with the FROM-GLC water mask. Specifically, more than 30% of the FROM-GLC water objects have been relabeled as shadows, and nearly 8% of land pixels in the water-land boundary zone have been relabeled as water, whereas, on the contrary, fewer than 2% of water pixels in the same zone have been relabeled as land. As a result, both the user's accuracy and Kappa coefficient of the new water mask (UA = 88.39%, Kappa = 0.87) have been substantially increased compared with those of the FROM-GLC product (UA = 81.97%, Kappa = 0.81).

Assessment of a diatom-based transfer function for the reconstruction of lake-level changes in Boqueirao Lake, Brazilian Nordeste	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Transfer functions have been developed to quantify the relations between organism assemblages and environmental variables and to apply these models to reconstruct past conditions. We present an assessment of a transfer function developed to reconstruct the depth of Boqueirao Lake in the Brazilian Northeast region. This region is affected by the Intertropical Convergence Zone and El Nino that create rainy and drought periods and that affect lake water level and can cause algal community compositional shifts. To reconstruct an algal depth profile of Boqueirao Lake, we used diatom calibration data-sets from 72 lake superficial sediment samples. After excluding rare species (<1%), we developed a transfer function model using sixty species, almost all exclusively benthic. Five environmental variables (silt, clay, pH, dissolved oxygen and depth) were also selected. Partial Canonical Correspondence Analysis indicated that silt and depth have the highest shared effect in terms of partially explained variance and lambda(1)/lambda(2). The reduced set of explanatory variables captured 14.3% of the total variance in diatom distributions. We assess six models to reconstruct past lake levels. No one model generated the best results in all aspects of transfer functions generated to map the water depth, but all reconstructions fall within the range of variation of the system. Although their results did not converge to a specific depth, they converged for depicting periods of lowered water levels or periods of floods. This convergence suggests that the diatom-based transfer function for the reconstruction of the paleodepth of Boqueirao Lake is reliable. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Caramanna, G; Ciotoli, G; Nisio, S				Caramanna, G.; Ciotoli, G.; Nisio, S.			A review of natural sinkhole phenomena in Italian plain areas	NATURAL HAZARDS					6th International Conference on Geomorphology	SEP 06-11, 2005	Zaragoza, SPAIN					Italian sinkholes, which are mainly related to karst phenomena (i.e., solution sinkholes, collapse sinkholes, etc.), are widespread along the Apennine ridge and in pedemontane areas where there are carbonatic bedrock outcrops. However, other collapses, which seem unrelated to karst dissolution, have been identified in plain areas with a thick sedimentary cover over buried bedrock. The main goal of this work is to study the geological, geomorphological, and structural setting of these areas to identify the possible mechanism of the generation and evolution of these collapses. About 750 cases were identified by research based on historical archives, specific geological literature, and information from local administrations. Geological, geomorphological, and hydro-geochemical surveys were conducted in 300 cases, supported by literature, borehole, and seismic data. A few examples were discarded because they could be ascribed to karst dissolution, volcanic origin (i.e., maar), or anthropogenic causes. Field studies regarding the other 450 cases are in progress. These cases occur along the Tyrrhenian margin (Latium, Abruzzo, Campania, Tuscany) in tectonic, coastal, and alluvial plains close to carbonate ridges. These plains are characterized by the presence of pressurized aquifers in the buried bedrock, overlaid by unconsolidated sediments (i.e., clay, sands, pyroclastic deposits, etc.). The majority of these collapses are aligned along regional master and seismogenetic faults. About 50% of the studied cases host small lakes or ponds, often characterized by highly mineralized springs enriched with CO2 and H2S. The Periadriatic margin does not seem to be affected by these phenomena, and only a few cases have been found in Sicily, Sardinia, and Liguria. The obtained scenarios suggests that this type of collapse could be related to upward erosion through vertical conduits (i.e., deep faults) caused by deep piping processes whose erosive strength is increased by the presence of acidic fluids.

J	Servant-Vildary, S; Servant, M; Jimenez, O				Servant-Vildary, S; Servant, M; Jimenez, O			Holocene hydrological and climatic changes in the southern Bolivian Altiplano according to diatom assemblages in paleowetlands	HYDROBIOLOGIA												This paper presents the first Holocene continuous record from the southern Bolivian Altiplano. In this area, the climate is now characterized by weak summer monsoon rains. The record is located north of Salar de Uyuni in a non-glacial valley (Rio Baja). Between similar to11 600 and similar to2210 cal year BP, the rivers accumulated fine deposits, while under the present climatic conditions, the fine particles are carried downstream by strong water floods. These deposits contain a rich diatom flora showing that the valley floor was occupied by paleowetlands. Water input needed to be more or less continuous to explain that the paleowetlands survived over a long period of time. We show that diatoms can be used to reconstruct the relative variations in the water level and the salinity throughout time, despite of the spatial complexity of this type of environment. During the Holocene, the water level was low except during some periods, dated similar to11 600-9800, similar to6330-5300, and similar to3110-2210 cal year BP. Saline and freshwater microhabitats were simultaneously present in the valley floor as indicated by a mixed diatom flora evidenced throughout the record. We propose a paleoclimatic scenario based on the assumption that the NE wet atmospheric flow of the monsoon was replaced by the westerlies of the southern hemisphere at the latitude of the study site.																			0018-8158					DEC	2001	466	1-3					267	277		10.1023/A:1014557417689	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1014557417689													WOS:000174354200024

Geochemical insight into differences in the physical structures and dynamics of two adjacent maar lakes at Mt. Vulture volcano (southern Italy)	GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS												Abstract We report on the first geochemical investigation of the Monticchio maar lakes (Mt. Vulture volcano, southern Italy) covering an annual cycle that aimed at understanding the characteristic features of the physical structures and dynamics of the two lakes. We provide the first detailed description of the lakes based on high-resolution conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) profiles, chemical and isotopic (H and O) compositions of the water, and the amounts of dissolved gases (e.g., He, Ar, CH4, and CO2). The combined data set reveals that the two lakes, which are separated by less than 200 m, exhibit different dynamics: one is a meromictic lake, where the waters are rich in biogenic and mantle-derived gases, while the other is a monomictic lake, which exhibits complete turnover of the water in winter and the release of dissolved gases. Our data strongly suggest that the differences in the dynamics of the two lakes are due to different density profiles affected by dissolved solutes, mainly Fe, which is strongly enriched in the deep water of the meromictic lake. A conceptual model of water balance was constructed based on the correlation between the chemical composition of the water and the hydrogen isotopic signature. Gas-rich groundwaters that feed both of the lakes and evaporation processes subsequently modify the water chemistry of the lakes. Our data highlight that no further potential hazardous accumulation of lethal gases is expected at the Monticchio lakes. Nevertheless, geochemical monitoring is needed to prevent the possibility of vigorous gas releases that have previously occurred in historical time.

There are presented, shortly, the results towards the possibility of flooding the terrain, the hydrogeological conditions, the pedological conditions and the most important issue the dates towards the pollution with heavy metals, organohalogen compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and polychlorinated biphenyls. In order to evaluate the pollution it were taking soil assays from three points of the location and they were chemical and physical analyzed. The carried out determinations showed that the Romanian limit values are not gone beyond the limit towards the pollution containing substances for the agriculture. On the other hand, it were made investigation towards the fertility level of the soil from the location. On these lines, it is also presented the reliability study made for the evaluation of the fertility and of the favorable conditions for using the surface of the lake as an agricultural terrain. The studies shows that there are some limitations towards using it as an agricultural terrain most of all towards pedological and fertility reasons. Having all these studies as a starting point in the paper it is presented the set of measures in order to use the terrain in agriculture. The proposed measures are enduring measures (it is estimated the period of rehabilitation 3 ... 4 years) which include: the degrease of the soil humidity throughout temporally works: leveling and modeling of the surface, making a ploughing for turning the soil, discing of the ploughed surface, the amelioration of the soil fertility and of the soil structure throughout the cultivation of fertility plants which are covered during the autumn by the ploughing.					; Paula, Cojocaru/GSE-0485-2022	COJOCARU, PAULA/0000-0001-9460-7492; 													1314-2704		978-619-7105-17-9				2014							229	236																WOS:000370816200032
J	Bratkovics, S; Sapozhnikova, Y				Bratkovics, Stephanie; Sapozhnikova, Yelena			Determination of seven commonly used organic UV filters in fresh and saline waters by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry	ANALYTICAL METHODS												An analytical method for the simultaneous determination of seven of the most widely used organic UV filter compounds in tap and saline waters was developed and validated. Target compounds included oxybenzone, dioxybenzone, sulisobenzone, avobenzone, octocrylene, octinoxate, and padimate-O. Water samples were adjusted to pH 2 prior to solid-phase extraction (SPE) using Oasis HLB 500 mg cartridges. The detection and quantification were performed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with positive electrospray ionization (ESI) using Multiple Reaction Monitoring mode (MRM). Calculated recoveries from fortified samples ranged from 74 to 109% with relative standard deviations of 6-25% for fortified tap water samples and from 71 to 111% with relative standard deviations 2-12% for fortified seawater samples, indicating acceptable method accuracy and precision (n = 5). Method reporting limits ranged from 0.5 to 25 ng L(-1) for the seven compounds. Oxybenzone, avobenzone, octocrylene, octinoxate, and padimate-O were detected in seawater samples collected from Folly Beach, South Carolina in the summer of 2010, at concentrations ranging from 10 to 2013 ng L(-1), demonstrating the ability of the developed method to measure target compounds in environmental samples. Oxybenzone and octocrylene were found in the highest concentrations, up to 2013 ng L(-1) and 1409 ng L(-1), respectively. Concentrations for avobenzone, octinoxate, and padimate-O ranged from 62-321 ng L(-1), 30-264 ng L(-1) and <1-111 ng L(-1), respectively, in surface seawater samples (n 4). Dioxybenzone and sulisobenzone were not detected in any samples from the four sites (method reporting limits 1 ng L(-1)).

J	Clarke, GKC; Leverington, DW; Teller, JT; Dyke, AS				Clarke, GKC; Leverington, DW; Teller, JT; Dyke, AS			Paleohydraulics of the last outburst flood from glacial Lake Agassiz and the 8200 BP cold event	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												During the last deglaciation of North America, huge proglacial lakes formed along the southern margin of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. The largest of these was glacial Lake Agassiz, which formed about 11.7 C-14 kyr and drained into Hudson Bay about 7.7 C-14 kyr (8.45 cal kyr). Overflow from these lakes was variably directed to the Mississippi, St. Lawrence and Mackenzie drainage systems and it is thought that switches in routing were accompanied by a response in ocean circulation that produced abrupt climate events. When the ice dam across Hudson Bay finally was breached, a massive flood drained Lake Agassiz, which was routed through Hudson Strait to the Labrador Sea. In terms of stored water volume the largest reservoir was associated with the Kinojevis level of Lake Agassiz. For this maximum filling, the impounded water volume available to produce floods is estimated as 40,000-151,000 km(3), depending on the location of the ice margin and route used. The timing of this rapid release of stored freshwater just precedes the early Holocene cooling event at 8.2 cal kyr BP. We use the Spring-Hutter theory to simulate flood hydrographs for floods that originate in subglacial drainage conduits and find that flood magnitude and duration are similar to5 Sv and similar to0.5 yr. Multiple fillings and floods are possible as are single floods having a complex multipulse structure. Modelling results suggest that the outburst flood from Lake Agassiz may have terminated before the lake surface elevation dropped to sea level and that the flood ended when a stable drainage channel was established, connecting Lake Agassiz to the Tyrrell Sea.

J	Håkanson, L; Boulion, VV				Håkanson, L; Boulion, VV			Regularities in primary production, Secchi depth and fish yield and a new system to define trophic and humic state indices for lake ecosystems	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY												General relationships between phytoplankton production, chlorophyll, total. dissolved and particulate phosphorus, Secchi depth, humic level, trophic level, fish production and latitude are described by regression equations using an extensive "Soviet" data base covering a wide domain of lake characteristics and a European data base. New systems for defining lake trophic and humic status are presented. The results may be used for more precise estimates of fundamental lake properties and for many practical issues of lake management, e.g.. predictions of fish catch. We have used strict chlorophyll-a concentrations for every trophic class and we have omitted Secchi depth from the trophic classes. sines Secchi depth and other variables strongly related to water clarity (like suspended particulate matter and particulate organic carbon) depend on autochthonous production, allochthonous influences and resuspension. We have used the Secchi depth as a simple operational measure of the effective depth of the photic zone. It has also been shown that among these lakes there exist a very strong relationship between primary production and latitude. In fact. 74% of the variability among the lakes in mean summer primary production can be statistically related to variations in latitude. These data also show a strong relationship between primary production and fish yield, which can be used to address many fundamental issues in lake management, like "normal and abnormal fish production".

We examined changes in the long-term distribution of fishes in relation to water quality and quantity in order to assess the condition and health of aquatic ecosystems in the basin. Sampling between 1985 and 1993 revealed that five (26%) of the 19 native fish species known from the basin had been extirpated. Two of these were endemics, Chirostoma charari and C. compressum, and they are presumed extinct. Twelve (63%) of the remaining species had declines in distribution. Sixteen (80%) of the 20 localities sampled had lost species. The greatest declines occurred in Lago de Cuitzeo proper and in the lower portion of the Rio Grande de Morelia watershed. Species losses from the lake were attributable to drying and hypreeutrophication of the lake because of substantial reductions in the amount and quality of tributary inputs, whereas losses from the Rio Grande de Morelia watershed were the result of pollution from agricultural, municipal, and industrial sources, especially in the region around the city of Morelia. Three localities in the upper por lion of the Rio Grande de Morelia watershed-Cointzio reservoir, La Mintzita spring, and insurgente Morelos stream-contained most of the remaining fish species diversity in the basin and deserve additional protection. Fish faunal changes indicated major declines in the health of aquatic ecosystems in the Morelia-Cuitzeo basin.					; López-López, Eugenia/AAI-2646-2019; Soto-Galera, Eduardo/AAU-7242-2020	Lopez-Lopez, Eugenia/0000-0003-2696-533X; 													0364-152X					JUL	1999	24	1					133	140																WOS:000080692300012

Patterns in Radon Activity in California Groundwater	ACS ES&T WATER												Naturally occurring radon-222 (Rn-222) is an effective marker of groundwater inflow to streams, lakes, and coastal environments. However, Rn-222 activity in groundwater is difficult to predict, and existing data are rarely interpreted in a hydrogeologic context. A total of 3582 dissolved Rn-222 samples in groundwater, 302 streamwater samples, and 10 samples from springs across California were used to understand the large-scale patterns of Rn-222 in the state's groundwater. In addition to Rn-222 activity, 54 additional analytes for the same samples together with surficial geology and well depth were used to assess controls on Rn-222 in groundwater. The results show that the lithology of the host formation is the most reliable predictor of Rn-222 activity in groundwater and that Rn-222 activity in groundwater is correlated most strongly with radiological (parent) constituents, further implicating the importance of the host lithology/mineralogy. We created a map of interpolated Rn-222 activity in groundwater across California, which should be a valuable reference for investigations of surface water-groundwater exchanges and potential health effects of Rn-222 in drinking water. The interpolated values from the map provide a rough approximation for experimental planning purposes and for assessing groundwater flux to surface water in areas where groundwater samples are inaccessible.

Minimum Flows and Levels Method of the St. Johns River Water Management District, Florida, USA	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The St. Johns River Water Management District (SJRWMD) has developed a minimum flows and levels (MFLs) method that has been applied to rivers, lakes, wetlands, and springs. The method is primarily focused on ecological protection to ensure systems meet or exceed minimum eco-hydrologic requirements. MFLs are not calculated from past hydrology. Information from elevation transects is typically used to determine MFLs. Multiple MFLs define a minimum hydrologic regime to ensure that high, intermediate, and low hydrologic conditions are protected. MFLs are often expressed as statistics of long-term hydrology incorporating magnitude (flow and/or level), duration (days), and return interval (years). Timing and rates of change, the two other critical hydrologic components, should be sufficiently natural. The method is an event-based, non-equilibrium approach. The method is used in a regulatory water management framework to ensure that surface and groundwater withdrawals do not cause significant harm to the water resources and ecology of the above referenced system types. MFLs are implemented with hydrologic water budget models that simulate long-term system hydrology. The method enables a priori hydrologic assessments that include the cumulative effects of water withdrawals. Additionally, the method can be used to evaluate management options for systems that may be over-allocated or for eco-hydrologic restoration projects. The method can be used outside of the SJRWMD. However, the goals, criteria, and indicators of protection used to establish MFLs are system-dependent. Development of regionally important criteria and indicators of protection may be required prior to use elsewhere.																			0364-152X	1432-1009				DEC	2008	42	6					1101	1114		10.1007/s00267-008-9199-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-008-9199-y								18802732					WOS:000260952100008
J	Reed, JM; Roberts, N; Leng, MJ				Reed, JM; Roberts, N; Leng, MJ			An evaluation of the diatom response to Late Quaternary environmental change in two lakes in the Konya Basin, Turkey, by comparison with stable isotope data	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS					International Symposium on the Late Quaternary in the Eastern Mediterranean Region	APR 01-04, 1997	MTA GEN DIRECTORATE, ANKARA, TURKEY		MTA GEN DIRECTORATE			In palaeolimnological studies of closed-basin lakes, diatoms provide an excellent source of palaeoclimate data owing to their sensitivity to salinity and lake-level change. One of the best ways of assessing the relationships between diatom species response, salinity and lake-level change is comparison with other proxy indicators, such as stable isotopes. The sensitivity of different lake systems to climate change (changes in the ratio of precipitation to evapotranspiration) depends to a large extent on the character of the basin hydrology. Here, we compare evidence for Late Quaternary palaeohydrological change in two lakes which have contrasting groundwater hydrology, located in close proximity to each other in the Konya Basin, southern central Turkey, and whose sediment core chronologies show considerable overlap. Suleymanhaci golu has alternated between being hydrologically closed and open during its history, and the diatom record shows clear evidence for changes in palaeoconductivity and lake level which correspond well to inferred changes in evaporative concentration during the Late Pleistocene and part of the Holocene. In contrast, the diatom record of the karstic spring-fed pool, Pinarbasi, indicates that it remained fresh throughout the Late Pleistocene; it is subject to major aquifer flow and behaves effectively as an open system. In this case the complacency of the diatom record is important in allowing inferences on temperature effects to be drawn from relatively subtle shifts in stable isotope values.

As a result, it represents an important site for assessing spatiotemporal patterns of past hydroclimatic variability. Combined sedimentologic and isotopic analyses are used to describe 1400 years of hydrologic variability within the lake and its drainage basin. Specifically, changes in sand content, percent total organic matter, and delta O-18((G. parvus)) values suggest changes in paleo-runoff, depositional environment, and relative delta O-18((lake water)) values, respectively. Nine AMS C-14 dates on discrete organic material provide age control with a basal age estimate of similar to 2400 cal years BP. However, we focus on the most recent 1400 years where the age model is most robust. The results indicate that coastal central California was relatively dry (less runoff) during the Medieval Climatic Anomaly (MCA) and variably wet (more runoff) during the Little Ice Age (LIA). These results are compared to Zaca Lake (Kirby et al. 2014) and Lake Elsinore (Kirby et al. 2010), both located south of Abbott Lake, and to flood event layers from Santa Barbara Basin (Hendy et al. 2013). All three sites, including SBB's flood event history, indicate a variably wet LIA and dry MCA; however, the absolute timing of wet and dry episodes is more congruent between Zaca and Elsinore than to Abbott Lake suggesting real spatiotemporal variability along the southern to central California coast. Finally, Abbott Lake is compared to Pacific Decadal Oscillation and Pacific sea surface temperature reconstructions. These comparisons suggest a Pacific-sourced control on late Holocene hydroclimates along coastal central California.

This reconstruction is based on analysis of pollen, chironomid, organic matter. oxygen-isotope, mineralogical, magnetic susceptibility and inferred lake-level data at a high temporal resolution. The chronology is derived using AMS radiocarbon dates, the position of the Laacher See Tephra (LST), and of correlation between the Lautrey and GRIP oxygen-isotope records. This data set reveals a detailed sequence of environmental changes in the Jura mountains from Greenland Stadial 2a to the early Holocene. Biotic and abiotic indicators allow the recognition of major abrupt changes associated with the GS-2a/GI-1e, GI-1a/GS-1 and GS-1/Preboreal transitions, and other minor fluctuations related to the cold events GI-1d, GI-1b and the Preboreal oscillation (PBO). They also suggest additional cooling spells at ca 14,550 and 14,350cal yr BP (Intra-Bolling Cold Periods), at ca 13,500 and ca 12,700cal yr BP just before the GS-1 onset, and at ca 11,350cal yr BP just before the PBO, as well as an intriguing brief warming episode within GS-1 at ca 12,080cal yr BP. Summer temperature increased by ca 5 degrees C at the start of GI-1e, and by 1.5-3 degrees C at the Holocene onset, while it decreased by ca 3-4 degrees C at the beginning of GS-1. Major changes in local hydrology and in seasonality appear to be also associated with the GS-2a/GI-1e, GI-1a/GS-1 and GS-1/Preboreal transitions. Pollen and abiotic indicators suggest a greater sensitivity of the vegetation cover to climatic oscillations during the first part of the Lateglacial Interstadial than during the second part (after ca 13,700 cal yr BP), when a closed forest had been restored in this area. By contrast, the restoration of forest cover took less than 300 yr after the end of GS-1. At the beginning of GI-1e and GS-1, no lag occurs (within the sampling resolution of 20-50yr) in the responses of aquatic (chironomids) and terrestrial (pollen) ecosystems, while, at the onset of the Holocene, the response of the vegetation appears slightly delayed in comparison with that of the chironomid community. Finally, the recognition of two successive tephra layers, which were deposited just before the LST at ca 12,950 cal yr BP and which originated from Le Puy de la Nugere (Massif Central, France), provides an additional tephrochronological tool for correlation between Lateglacial European sequences.

Detailed spatial and temporal sampling was conducted on one lake, Wallywash Great Pond. Chemical data, together with D/H, O-18/O-16, C-13/C-12 and Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios confirm that the karstic spring waters entering the lake evolve chemically through degassing, mixing with rainfall and runoff, biogenic decalcification (resulting mainly from bicarbonate assimilation by the high biomass of submerged macrophytes), and evaporation. Modern carbonate sedimentation in Wallywash Great Pond is largely of high-Mg calcite. This is consistent with Mg/Ca molar ratios >2 within much of the lake. However, aragonite forms on the adaxial leaf surfaces of Potamogeton spp. This may be explained either asa result of locally elevated Mg concentrations or a high degree of supersaturation favouring very rapid carbonate precipitation. Two small lakes to the north of Wallywash Great Pond show minor influence of the Na-Cl dominated coastal aquifer, suggesting that coastal lakes are sensitive to variations in the boundary between fresh and brackish groundwater caused by changes in climate or sea level. Their C-13/C-12 ratios are strongly influenced by biogenic CO2 derived from plant respiration or decay.

DESMID COMMUNITY COMPOSITION AND DISTRIBUTION IN RELATION TO LAKE TYPE AND WATER CHEMISTRY	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Quantitative data on the generic composition of the euplankton and aufwuchs desmid communities of 61 Wisconsin [USA] lakes are summarized. Information with respect to the role of the various genera [Arthrodesmus, Bambusina, Closterium, Cosmarium, Desmidium, Euastrum, Gonatozygon, Hyalotheca, Micrasterias, Netrium, Penium, Phymatodocis, Pleurotaenium, Sphaerozosma, Spondylosium, Staurastrum, Tetmemorus, Triploceras, Xanthidium] in terms of frequency, density, and relative importance; the suitability of various lake types for harboring desmid communities; and the relationships between chemical parameters and desmid distribution is analyzed. The genera Staurastrum, Cosmarium and Closterium are of wide occurrence, appear to play major roles in the communities of all lake types, and are the most tolerant of varying chemical conditions. Most euplankton genera are of importance only in acid bogs, but aufwuchs genera generally are more widely distributed. Both the euplankton and the aufwuchs communities appear to be composed of 1-4 desmid assemblages, each with a differing range of importance values. Based on biological criteria, acid bogs appear to be the most suitable lake type for harboring desmid communities and calcareous spring ponds the least suitable type. High generic diversity of desmids appears to be correlated with low conductivity, Ca and alkalinity levels, pH values of 5.1-7.0, and the presence of free CO2. The evidence attending various hypotheses concerning water chemistry and desmid distribution appears contradictory, and further studies are needed to help clarify the situation.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1976	51	1					3	31		10.1007/BF00007982	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00007982													WOS:A1976CN15200001

A heuristic simulation model of Lake Ontario circulation and mass balance transport	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												The redistribution of suspended organisms and materials by large-scale currents is part of natural ecological processes in large aquatic systems but can contribute to ecosystem disruption when exotic elements are introduced into the system. Toxic compounds and planktonic organisms spend various lengths of time in suspension before settling to the bottom or otherwise being removed. We constructed a simple physical simulation model, including the influence of major tributaries, to qualitatively examine circulation patterns in Lake Ontario. We used a simple mass balance approach to estimate the relative water input to and export from each of 10 depth regime-specific compartments (nearshore vs. offshore) comprising Lake Ontario. Despite its simplicity, our model produced circulation patterns similar to those reported by more complex studies in the literature. A three-gyre pattern, with the classic large counterclockwise central lake circulation, and a simpler two-gyre system were both observed. These qualitative simulations indicate little offshore transport along the south shore, except near the mouths of the Niagara River and Oswego River. Complex flow structure was evident, particularly near the Niagara River mouth and in offshore waters of the eastern basin. Average Lake Ontario residence time is 8 years, but the fastest model pathway indicated potential transport of plankton through the lake in as little as 60 days. This simulation illustrates potential invasion pathways and provides rough estimates of planktonic larval dispersal or chemical transport among nearshore and offshore areas of Lake Ontario.

Past freeze and thaw cycling in the margin of the El'gygytgyn crater deduced from a 141 m long permafrost record	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												The continuous sediment record from Lake El'gygytgyn in the northeastern Eurasian Arctic spans the last 3.6 Ma and for much of this time permafrost dynamics and lake level changes have likely played a crucial role for sediment delivery to the lake. Changes in the ground-ice hydrochemical composition (delta O-18, delta D, pH, electrical conductivity, Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+, K+, HCO3-, Cl-, SO4-) of a 141 m long permafrost record from the western crater plain are examined to reconstruct repeated periods of freeze and thaw at the lake edge. Stable water isotope and major ion records of ground ice in the permafrost reflect both a synsedimentary palaeo-precipitation signal preserved in the near-surface permafrost (0.0-9.1 m core depth) and a post-depositional record of thawing and refreezing in deeper layers of the core (9.1-141.0 m core depth). These lake marginal permafrost dynamics were controlled by lake level changes that episodically flooded the surfaces and induced thaw in the underlying frozen ground. During times of lake level fall these layers froze over again. At least three cycles of freeze and thaw are identified and the hydrochemical data point to a vertical and horizontal talik refreezing through time. Past permafrost thaw and freeze may have destabilised the basin slopes of Lake El'gygytgyn and this has probably promoted the release of mass movements from the lake edge to the deeper basin as known from frequently occurring turbidite layers in the lake sediment column.

Sulfur isotope studies to quantify sulfate components in water of flooded lignite open pits -: Lake Goitsche, Germany	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												A system of connected lignite mining pits (part of the former Goitsche mining complex, Germany) was flooded with river water between 1999 and 2002. A considerable accumulation of acid associated with oxidized sulfides in sediments was seen as a critical point for the development of the lake water. To characterize the components contributing to the supply of dissolved lake water SO4 hydro-chemical and isotope investigations with respect to groundwater, pore water in the sulfide bearing sediments, river water and lake water were performed. delta S-34 of pore water SO4 that was dominated by oxidized pyrites ranges around -25 parts per thousand. VCDT and differs strongly from river water SO4 with about +4.4 parts per thousand. Thus, interactions between lake water and sediments were particularly pronounced during the first phase of flooding. For this period, a more quantitative estimation of the SO4 components in the lake water was difficult because of the heterogeneous SO4 distributions between the different sub-basins of the lake and according to the flooding process itself. Later, a component separation was attempted following mixing of the whole lake, which first occurred in spring 2002. A very heterogeneous groundwater environment with respect to highly variable SO4 concentrations and delta S-34 values and changing interaction with the forming lakes proved to be one of the most important limitations in the calculations of the mixing.

J	Chucholl, C; Pfeiffer, M				Chucholl, Christoph; Pfeiffer, Michael			First evidence for an established Marmorkrebs (Decapoda, Astacida, Cambaridae) population in Southwestern Germany, in syntopic occurrence with Orconectes limosus (Rafinesque, 1817)	AQUATIC INVASIONS												Marmorkrebs are one of 12 currently known non-indigenous crayfish species (NICS) to be found in Central European waters. It is unique in the manner that there exist only females which reproduce parthenogenetically, i.e. eggs develop unfertilized and all offspring are genetically identical. Marmorkrebs have been first discovered in the German aquarium trade in the mid 1990s and became a very common pet species since then. Here, we present first evidence for a well established Marmorkrebs population in a small lake in the Upper Rhine catchment near Freiburg (Germany). The population occurs syntopically with Orconectes limosus, another NICS which invaded the Rhine system about 50 years ago. Morphometric and ovary weight measurements were taken from 12 Marmorkrebs specimens that were captured on July 3, 2010. The rostrum spination was pronounced and resembled the one found on a free-living individual captured in Saxony (Germany). Ovary development stages (Gonadosomatic Index) were heterogeneous and single berried females were found from early June to late July, which might indicate an asynchronous breeding habit. The relative abundance and distribution of both crayfish species were assessed by visual counts at nighttime at two occasions. Both species attained a comparable, moderate density throughout the lake margin. The Marmorkrebs was the prevalent species on shallow, swampy habitat patches, which are presumably similar to its natural prime habitats. The successful establishment of Marmorkrebs despite a pre-existing O. limosus population, stresses the competitive ability of Marmorkrebs. In addition to the recently suggested hypothesis that Marmorkrebs might be temperature limited in most parts of Europe, we feel that it is also necessary to consider its probable natural prime habitats and life cycle: Marmorkrebs are presumably able to colonize summer-warm, lentic habitats in most parts of Central Europe.

Rapid stable isotope turnover of larval fish in a Lake Superior coastal wetland: Implications for diet and life history studies	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Trophic linkages of larval fish in Lake Superior coastal habitats can be identified using naturally occurring differences in the stable isotope ratios of nitrogen ((15)N: (14)N, delta(15)N) and carbon ((13)C: (12)C, delta(13)C). We measured (13)C and (15)N values in common fish larvae weekly during spring run-off (late-April to mid-July) in the hydrologically complex drowned river mouth of the St. Louis River, the second largest tributary to Lake Superior. For all species, delta(13)C was increasingly negative with increasing weight as the fish developed from the yolk-sac stage, during which they possess a maternally-derived isotopic signature, to an exogenously feeding larvae. Trends in delta(15)N with increasing weight varied among species; an increase, decrease, and no change in delta(15)N were observed. A weight-based stable isotope turnover function modeled well the observed changes in delta(13)C and delta(15)N. In general, fish obtained a constant signature after a 10-fold gain in body mass, implying their tissue was at isotopic equilibrium with their diet. Difference between yolk-sac and larvae delta(13)C and delta(15)N revealed distinct patterns in larval origin and settlement. Based on the species analyzed, we identify two specific Lake Superior coastal wetland-dependent fish early life histories that incorporate habitat use, movement, and trophic dynamics. This study thus provides a methodological approach that can potentially help resolve interactions between watershed character, coastal productivity, and Lake Superior that are of significance to the lake's fisheries.																			1463-4988						2011	14	4					403	413		10.1080/14634988.2011.628212	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14634988.2011.628212													WOS:000298355900009

Evidence is twofold. First, relatively large amounts of the gammacerane skeleton are sequestered in S-rich macromolecular aggregates formed by natural sulphurisation of functionalised lipids. Selective cleavage of polysulphide linkages with MeLi/Mel led to formation of 3-methylthiogammacerane, indicating that the gammacerane skeleton is primarily bound via sulphur at position 3, consistent with the idea that tetrahymanol (or the corresponding ketone) is the precursor for gammacerane. Second, upon mild artificial maturation of two sediments using hydrous pyrolysis, gammacerane is released from S-rich macromolecular aggregates by cleavage of the relatively weak C-S bonds. The stable carbon isotopic compositions of gammacerane and lipids derived from primary producers and green sulphur bacteria in both the Miocene Gessoso-solfifera and Upper Jurassic Allgau Formations indicate that gammacerane is derived from bacterivorous ciliates which were partially feeding on green sulphur bacteria. This demonstrates that anaerobic ciliates living at or below the chemocline are important sources for gammacerane, consistent with the fact that ciliates only biosynthesize tetrahymanol if their diet is deprived of sterols. This leads to the conclusion that gammacerane is an indicator for water column stratification, which solves two current enigmas in gammacerane geochemistry. Firstly, it explains why gammacerane is often found in sediments deposited under hypersaline conditions but is not necessarily restricted to this type of deposits. Secondly, it explains why lacustrine deposits may contain abundant gammacerane since most lakes in the temperate climatic zones are stratified during summer.

Depending on the geographical location and the season, these lakes can strongly vary in temperature. To obtain a comprehensive understanding of the molecular and physiological adaptations to low temperature, we compared the responses of two Thioalkalivibrio strains to low (10 degrees C) and high (30 degrees C) temperatures. For this, the strains were grown under controlled conditions in chemostats and analyzed for their gene expression (RNA sequencing [RNA-Seq]), membrane lipid composition, and glycine betaine content. The strain Thioalkalivibrio versutus AL2(T) originated from a soda lake in southeast Siberia that is exposed to strong seasonal temperature differences, including freezing winters, whereas Thioalkalivibrio nitratis ALJ2 was isolated from an East African Rift Valley soda lake with a constant warm temperature the year round. The strain AL2(T) grew faster than ALJ2 at 10 degrees C, likely due to its 3-fold-higher concentration of the osmolyte glycine betaine. Moreover, significant changes in the membrane lipid composition were observed for both strains, leading to an increase in their unsaturated fatty acid content via the Fab pathway to avoid membrane stiffness. Genes for the transcriptional and translational machinery, as well as for counteracting cold-induced hampering of nucleotides and proteins, were upregulated. Oxidative stress was reduced by induction of vitamin B-12 biosynthesis genes, and growth at 10 degrees C provoked downregulation of genes involved in the second half of the sulfur oxidation pathway. Genes for intracellular signal transduction were differentially expressed, and interestingly, AL2(T) upregulated flagellin expression, whereas ALJ2 downregulated it. IMPORTANCE In addition to their haloalkaline conditions, soda lakes can also harbor a variety of other extreme parameters, to which their microbial communities need to adapt. However, for most of these supplementary stressors, it is not well known yet how haloalkaliphiles adapt and resist. Here, we studied the strategy for adaptation to low temperature in the haloalkaliphilic genus Thioalkalivibrio by using two strains isolated from soda lakes with different temperature regimes. Even though the strains showed a strong difference in growth rate at 10 degrees C, they exhibited similar molecular and physiological adaptation responses. We hypothesize that they take advantage of resistance mechanisms against other stressors commonly found in soda lakes, which are therefore maintained in the bacteria living in the absence of low-temperature pressure. A major difference, however, was detected for their glycine betaine content at 10 degrees C, highlighting the power of this osmolyte to also act as a key compound in cryoprotection.

Stratigraphic architecture of the Sonia Fluvial interval, India in its Precambrian context	PRECAMBRIAN RESEARCH												Stratigraphic architecture of the fluvial interval at the base of the Neoproterozoic Sonia Sandstone, Rajasthan, India has been evaluated in consideration of the vegetationless Precambrian depositional environment. For its critical appreciation, facies, architectural elements, bounding surfaces, deductive palaeohydraulics, palaeocurrents, distribution of soft sediment deformation structures, as well as sequence stratigraphic status of the interval have been taken into account. Confined between an unconformity at the base and an overlying transgressive lag, the interval is considered a lowstand product. Temporal shifts in base profile, nevertheless, affected the tripartite division of the LST, systems tract developed during relative sea level lowstand. Palaeocurrent diversions across division boundaries as well as preferred concentration of soft sediment deformation structures along the top of the middle division make the role of tectonics evident. Facies, architectural elements, palaeohydraulic derivations as well as the degree of palaeocurrent consistency depict significant differences in channel patterns between the divisions. The axiom regarding braided patterns, frequent avulsion, and the ephemeral nature and flashy behavior of Precambrian rivers find conformity only in Division II. The river systems in Divisions I and III had frequently become meandering, due to valley constriction in the former and bank stability in the latter. Division I accumulated through sediment aggradation within a constricted valley incised deeply into the bedrock during the preceding course of base profile fall. Channel amalgamation characterizes Division I and more profoundly, Division II. The sharp upward transition from Division II to III records rapid enhancement in the rate of rise of base profile due to basin subsidence leading to encroachment of the contemporary sea. Mud settling was encouraged because of ponding at the downstream end turning the river channels fixed. Eventually the depositional site was drowned under the sea. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This, despite the fact that much still remains to be learned about their design and effectiveness. Problems often associated with their selection and design are compounded by the stochastic nature of stormwater runoff and its variability with location and climate. Where one city may experience six months of gentle, long-duration rains, another will experience many convective and frontal rainstorms followed by severe winter snows, while still another will experience mostly few convective, storms. An evaluation of precipitation records reveal that the majority of storms at most location are relatively small and produce less precipitation and runoff than is often used in the design of traditional storm drainage networks. These are the storms that need to be targeted when attempting to mitigate the effects of urbanization on the receiving waters such as streams, rivers, lakes, estuaries, bays, reservoirs, etc. This paper discusses several structural BMPs as to their effectiveness in removing pollutants, mitigating flow rates and in addressing some of the stipulated effects of urban runoff on receiving water systems. Also, stormwater quality management hydrology is discussed and a procedure for the hydrologic sizing of BMPs is recommended. Finally, this paper offers a summarized engineering design guidance for some of the more commonly used BMPs.																					0-7844-0424-0				1999							242	262																WOS:000084505700018

HUMAN IMPACT ON MARINE WATER NUTRIENTS ENRICHMENT	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY												Main drivers implying impact on the Black Sea water quality (WQ) along the Bulgarian coast are industry, urbanisation, tourism, navigation and agriculture. The aim of this paper is identification and evaluation of land-based sources (LBS) contributing to the nutrient enrichment of Black Sea coastal areas. Polluted rivers and municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) discharges are accountable for excessive enrichment of sea waters with nitrogen, phosphorus and organic matter. The majority of municipal WWTPs, located along the Bulgarian coast, directly discharge into the sea and provide 68% of the total nitrogen load and 15% of the total phosphorus load. Additionally, wastewaters from 5 sewages flow into the sea without any treatment. A few WWTPs discharge into coastal lakes connected to the sea. Their impact on the Black Sea is indirect, yet significant due to the large pollutants load they bring to the environment. A number of new touristic facilities in Bulgarian resorts are not connected to the sewage system. Besides, some WWTPs have insufficient capacity to treat the increased amount of wastewaters delivered in summer, often they discharge insufficiently treated waters to the Black Sea which results in elevated nutrients level in coastal waters. The largest river along the Bulgarian coast is Kamchia, and it is also the most significant source of nutrients and pollutants for the Bulgarian Black Sea waters. Analysis of available data on nutrients load reveals three areas of maximum anthropogenic impact along the Bulgarian coast. These are the Varna and Burgas bays, and the Kamchia river mouth, which are exposed to direct or indirect influence of industrial and municipal discharges, port operations, tourism development and also inputs of nutrients from diffuse sources.

Although the reservoirs have substantial added value to residents, their use as water resource is jeopardized by eutrophication and a high occurrence of blooms of toxic cyanobacteria. So far, there is no systematic information available on the limnological and aquatic ecological characteristics of these dams. We carried out a standardized survey of 32 reservoirs and assessed a wide set of morphometric, abiotic and biotic variables. The sampling was performed during two seasons, September-October 2004 (end of the wet season/start of the dry season) and April-May 2005 (towards the end of the dry season). Using multivariate analysis, we revealed dominating patterns of variable associations and compared the variability in these patterns among seasons. According to standardized PCA and RDA analyses, the most important axis of variation was mainly represented by a gradient in nutrients and altitude that was also positively associated with phytoplankton biomass, suspended matter and oxygen concentration, and negatively with water transparency. For most variables, correlations between the wet and dry season were weak, which suggests that individual reservoirs behaved rather differently in their response to seasonal changes. Nevertheless, a Mantel correlation (r = 0.32; P = 0.035) showed a weak but significant overall concordance in the variable association patterns among seasons. A number of reservoirs became very shallow or fell dry in the dry season, a process that was associated with an increase in suspended matter and conductivity and a decrease in transparency. These reservoirs contained lower amounts of fish and tended to be less eutrophic than the deeper, permanent systems, as they had lower levels of phosphorus and chlorophyll-a. With multiple regression analysis, we constructed most parsimonious models in an attempt to explain the variation in key biotic variables: phytoplankton and cyanobacteria biomass, cladoceran biomass, fish biomass and the abundance of submerged vegetation. Phytoplankton and fish biomass tended to be positively related with the concentration of total phosphorus, whereas cladoceran biomass was not associated with nutrient concentrations. The positive association of fish and phytoplankton with nutrient concentrations suggests a bottom-up control, whereas the absence of an association between zooplankton and nutrient concentrations may be indicative for top-down control. The biomass of cyanobacteria was negatively related to the biomass of cladocerans (Daphnia), which likely reflects a top-down effect. Most reservoirs were turbid. The occurrence and abundance of macrophytes tended to be positively related to water transparency and was negatively associated to TP and the amount of livestock frequenting the reservoirs. However, macrophytes were not limited to clear-water reservoirs.					; Dejene, Tsehaye/KVB-8699-2024; De Meester, Luc/F-3832-2015; Nyssen, Jan/B-8280-2009; Gebremichael, Anwar/D-2388-2016; Declerck, Steven/E-4338-2010	Mulugeta, Afework/0000-0003-0707-4363; De Meester, Luc/0000-0001-5433-6843; Nyssen, Jan/0000-0002-2666-3860; Dejene, Tsehaye Asmelash/0000-0002-6182-6223; Asgedom, Abraha Gebrekidan/0000-0002-6996-7426; Declerck, Steven/0000-0001-6179-667X													0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP	2008	610						193	209		10.1007/s10750-008-9435-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-008-9435-8													WOS:000257392300017

Diets of Staging Phalaropes at Great Salt Lake, Utah	WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN												Great Salt Lake, Utah, USA, is a critical staging area for Wilson's (Phalaropus tricolor) and red-necked (Phalaropus lobatus) phalaropes. Both phalarope species depend upon abundant invertebrate prey in Great Salt Lake to fuel fall migrations, but the lake currently faces the threat of becoming increasingly saline due to water diversions and climate change. The lake changes may decrease the ability of Great Salt Lake to support the large populations of phalaropes that currently depend upon it. Assessing how a smaller and more saline Great Salt Lake will affect phalaropes is difficult without knowing what phalaropes are consuming during staging. We collected phalaropes from 4 different Great Salt Lake bays from 2012 through 2015 and identified prey items in their upper digestive tracts. We measured wet weights of different food items and examined total mass of food consumed by weighing gizzard contents. Phalarope diets differed across time and bays, and between phalarope species. Red-necked phalaropes primarily consumed corixids (Corixidae) and brine fly (Ephydra hians, Ephydra cinerea) larva, pupa, and adults, whereas Wilson's phalaropes consumed brine flies, chironomids (Chironomidae) and Daphnia (Daphnia magna). Despite the abundance of brine shrimp (Artemia franciscana) in Great Salt Lake, both phalarope species rarely consumed them. Our results documented that phalaropes of Great Salt Lake are dependent for food in the less-saline Farmington Bay and on brine flies produced in the hypersaline bays. Such information is critical for wildlife managers who are tasked with ensuring that Great Salt Lake will continue to support the large phalarope populations that depend on the lake's resources.

Variable littoral-pelagic coupling as a food-web response to seasonal changes in pelagic primary production	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Lakes are among the most seasonally forced ecosystems on Earth. Seasonal variation in temperature and light produce cyclic patterns in water column mixing, nutrient supply and phytoplankton biomass. Diet responses of consumers to these patterns have rarely been quantified. Moreover, pelagic-littoral coupling of dietary resources by mobile consumers is commonly considered to be static over annual cycles. 2. This study quantifies littoral-pelagic diet responses of multiple consumers to a strong shift in pelagic phytoplankton abundance over an annual cycle (September 2014 to August 2015) in a large (area 614 km(2)), oligotrophic, monomictic lake (Lake Taupo, New Zealand). Intra-annual patterns in pelagic phytoplankton (chlorophyll a) and zooplankton were determined over multiple years. Major resource and consumer delta C-13 and delta N-15 were then collected over an annual cycle. Temporal patterns in food-web structure were examined using convex hulls as a proxy of community trophic niche size. Diet was quantified using mixing models for zooplankton, meso-predatory zooplanktivorous common smelt (Retropinna retropinna) and benthivorous common bullies (Gobiomorphus cotidianus), as well as the top-predator rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Trophic structure patterns for smelt, bullies and trout were then independently examined using compound-specific amino acid delta N-15 analyses (CSIA-AA). 3. Lake Taupo demonstrated similar food-web patterns to other lakes globally. Phytoplankton and zooplankton demonstrated strong seasonal oscillations of abundance driven by both bottom-up (nutrient supply) and top-down (stable limit cycle) drivers. The food web demonstrated the typical nested structure. It responded to seasonally low and high pelagic resource availability periods by expansion and contraction, respectively, of trophic niche space. In response to lower pelagic phytoplankton abundance during summer stratification, and phytoplankton accumulation at a deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM), zooplankton abundance reduced and their diet became dominated by phytoplankton from below the thermocline (i.e. the hypolimnion and DCM). This change may have been prompted by the combined drivers of avoidance of predation and depauperate food supply in surface waters. 4. The diet of smelt and bullies switched from predominantly zooplankton to benthic macroinvertebrates, synchronous with the decline in pelagic zooplankton. Trout diet, inferred from comparison of isotopic signatures of tissues with different turnover rates, also increased littoral resource reliance over the stratified period. Smelt, bully and trout CSIA-AA data confirmed estimates of trophic position and indicated a greater degree of trophic complexity in the littoral than the pelagic food chain. 5. Food webs in large, deep lakes such as Taupo are expected to be primarily pelagic. This study demonstrates the need to re-examine this expectation due to seasonal variations in productivity. The relatively small littoral areas in large lakes, combined with meso-predators' highly seasonally variable littoral resource use, may drive strong seasonal top-down effects on littoral macroinvertebrate prey. Our study supports the notion that food-web interactions are highly dynamic and responsive to seasonal forcing. By linking food-web dynamics to dynamic environmental conditions, this study provides a framework for future studies research on understanding lake food-web responses to a range of annual/seasonal and global environmental change drivers.

Carbon isotope discrimination in plant leaves ( Delta(leaf)) is an established indicator of past hydroclimate because the fractionation of carbon isotopes during photosynthesis is strongly influenced by water stress. Leaves of the evergreen tree Melaleuca quinquenervia have been recovered from the sediments of some perched lakes on North Stradbroke and Fraser Islands, south-east Queensland, eastern Australia. Here, we examine the potential for using M. quinquenervia. Delta(leaf) as a tracer of past rainfall by analysing carbon isotope ratios ( delta C-13) of modern leaves. We firstly assess Delta(leaf) variation at the leaf and stand scale and find no systematic pattern within leaves or between leaves due to their position on the tree. We then examine the relationships between climate and Delta(leaf) for a 11-year time series of leaves collected in a litter tray. M. quinquenervia retains its leaves for 1-4 years; thus, cumulative average climate data are used. There is a significant relationship between annual mean. Delta(leaf) and mean annual rainfall of the hydrological year for 1-4 years ( i.e. 365-1460 days) prior to leaf fall ( r(2) = 0.64, P = 0.003, n = 11). This relationship is marginally improved by accounting for the effect of pCO(2) on discrimination ( r(2) = 0.67, P = 0.002, n = 11). The correlation between rainfall and Delta(leaf), and the natural distribution of Melaleuca quinquenervia around wetlands of eastern Australia, Papua New Guinea and New Caledonia offers significant potential to infer past rainfall on a wide range of spatial and temporal scales.					; Henderson, Andrew/A-1434-2009; McInerney, Francesca/ABE-3639-2020; Henderson, Andrew C.

J	PFENNIG, DW; LOEB, MLG; COLLINS, JP				PFENNIG, DW; LOEB, MLG; COLLINS, JP			PATHOGENS AS A FACTOR LIMITING THE SPREAD OF CANNIBALISM IN TIGER SALAMANDERS	OECOLOGIA												Intraspecific predation is taxonomically widespread, but few species routinely prey on conspecifics. This is surprising as conspecifics could be a valuable resource for animals limited by food. A potential cost of cannibalism that has been largely unexplored is that it may enhance the risk of acquiring debilitating pathogens or toxins from conspecifics. We examined how pathogens affect variation in the incidence of cannibalism in tiger salamander larvae (Ambystoma tigrinum nebulosum), which occurs as two environmentally-induced morphs, typicals and cannibals. Salamanders from one population were more likely than those in another to develop into cannibals, even when reared under identical conditions. Variation in the propensity to become a cannibal may be caused by variation in pathogen density. In the population with cannibals at low frequency, bacterial blooms in late summer correlated with massive die-offs of salamanders. The frequency of cannibals correlated significantly negatively with bacterial density in ten different natural lakes. In the laboratory, cannibals exposed to a diseased conspecific always preyed on the sick animal. As a result, cannibals were more likely to acquire and die from disease than were typicals that were similarly exposed, or cannibals that were exposed to healthy conspecifics. Since conspecifics often share lethal pathogens, enhanced risk of disease may explain why cannibalism is generally infrequent. Pathogens may constrain not only the tendency to be behaviorally cannibalistic, but also the propensity to develop specialized cannibal morphologies.																			0029-8549						1991	88	2					161	166		10.1007/BF00320806	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00320806								28312127					WOS:A1991GM33100003

Methods A mixed methods research study was initiated in the Lake Zone areas of Northwestern Tanzania in the summer of 2018. The goal was to identify the impact of education and training on sterile processing practices at ten hospitals. Quantitative data analyzed included hospital assessments of sterile processing practices prior to and 4 months after training, as well as participant test scores collected at the beginning of training, after 5 days of classes, and 4 months after mentorship was completed. Thematic analysis of interviews with participants 4 months post-training was completed to identify associated impact of training. Results Improvement in test scores were found to be directly related to sterile processing training. The greatest sterile processing practice changes identified through hospital assessments involved how instruments were cleaned, both at point of use and during the cleaning process, resulting in rusted and discoloured instruments appearing as new again. Themes identified in participant interviews included: changes in practice, challenges in implementing practice changes, resource constraints, personal and professional growth, and increased motivation, confidence and responsibility. Conclusions Providing education and follow up support for workers in sterile processing resulted in increased knowledge of best practices, application of knowledge in practice settings, and awareness of issues that need to be overcome to decrease risks for patients and health care workers alike. Further research is needed to identify the impact of mentorship on hospital sterile processing practices in order to provide clear direction for future spending on training courses.					; Nyanza, Elias/F-3009-2018	Cuncannon, Alexander/0000-0002-5946-1181; 													2047-2994					NOV 20	2019	8	1							183	10.1186/s13756-019-0633-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13756-019-0633-0								31832183					WOS:000498666500001

One of the most important impact is the increasing of extreme precipitation. Increases in heavy precipitation may not always lead to an increase in total precipitation, over a season or over the year. Heavy precipitations increasing has also been documented even when mean total precipitation decreases. This may occur when the probability of precipitation (the number of events) decreases, or if the shape of the precipitation distribution changes, but this latter situation is less. Some climate models forecast a decrease in moderate rainfall, and an increase in the length of dry periods, which offsets the increased precipitation falling during heavy events. Climate impacts are compounded by urban development, which removes the vegetation and soil that slow and filter water, coming from rainfall. Urban sprawl also increases impervious surfaces, which move water over the land and put them, directly, into receiving lakes, rivers and estuaries. To contrast these negative impacts, a solution may be to limit the use of non-permeable surfaces, like concrete, in the urban areas. In this regard, the authors, as researchers of "Sapienza University of Rome", are studying the possibility of using, in the parking areas of a central Italian city (Rieti), pavement with "green infrastructure", that can reduce runoff and flood risks during storms. The construction of the pavement with "green infrastructure", can first mitigate the effect of exceptional rains, secondly reduce the soil consumption. Permeable, or pervious, pavements reduce runoff by allowing rain and melting snow to infiltrate. A first study of the materials, that can be used as parking paving, has led to estimate a permeability coefficient of 2,70 .10(-5) m.s(-1). In the case study, object of this paper, the authors have first calculated the area, in square meters, of the municipal parking areas of Rieti city. Secondly, they have valuated the possibility of change the concrete pavement, today present in this areas, with a "green infrastructure" pavement, and they have estimated volumes of water that will be infiltrate, in case of extreme precipitations. This estimation was made through the real precipitations data of the last 7 years, measured by the National Hydrographic Service of Italy.					; De Filippi, Francesco Maria/JTS-9909-2023	De Filippi, Francesco Maria/0000-0002-7204-880X; 													1757-8981						2019	471								102052	10.1088/1757-899X/471/10/102052	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1757-899X/471/10/102052													WOS:000465811805067

Improving historical precipitation estimates over the Lake Superior basin	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Lake Superior, the northern-most of the Laurentian Great Lakes, is the largest (by surface area) freshwater lake on the planet. Due in part to its high water surface to land area ratio, over one-third of the Lake Superior basin water budget is derived from precipitation falling directly on the lake surface. For most of the Great Lakes (including Lake Superior), historical precipitation estimates extend back to the early 1880s, and are based primarily on land-based gauge measurements. While alternatives to gauge-based estimates have been explored, there is no clear history of applying regional climate models (RCMs) to improve historical over-lake precipitation estimates. To address this gap in regional research, and to advance the state-of-the-art in Great Lakes regional hydrological modeling, we compare 21 years of output (1980-2000) from an RCM to conventional gauge-based precipitation estimates for the same time period over the Lake Superior basin. We find that the RCM, unlike the gauge-based method, simulates realistic variations in over-lake atmospheric stability, which propagate into basin-wide precipitation estimates with a relatively low over-lake to over-land precipitation ratio in warm months (roughly 0.7 to 0.8 in June, July, and August) and a relatively high over-lake to over-land precipitation ratio in cold months (roughly 1.3 to 1.4 in December and January), compared to gauge-based estimates. Our findings underscore a need to potentially update historical gauge-based precipitation estimates for large lake systems, including Lake Superior, and that RCMs appear to provide a robust and defensible basis for making those updates.

J	Vijverberg, T; Winterwerp, JC; Aarninkhof, SGJ; Drost, H				Vijverberg, Thomas; Winterwerp, Johan Christian; Aarninkhof, Stefan Gert Jan; Drost, Hans			Fine sediment dynamics in a shallow lake and implication for design of hydraulic works	OCEAN DYNAMICS												Lake Markermeer is a large (680 km(2)), shallow body of water in the middle of the Netherlands, with a mean water depth of 3.6 m. One of the major problems in the lake is its decreasing ecological value which is, among other reasons, caused by a gradual increase of suspended sediment concentration and associated increase of light attenuation in the water column. A thorough understanding of fine sediment dynamics in the lake is a prerequisite for solving this problem. This paper addresses the 3D nature of near-bed sediment dynamics in Lake Markermeer, based on data sampled from a 1-month field experiment in autumn 2007. The campaign involved the collection of 71 bed samples across the lake. At each location, dual-frequency echo soundings were carried out to assess the thickness of the silt layer, and sediment concentration throughout the water column was measured with an Optical Backscatter Sensor (OBS). Moreover, 2-week time series of wave height, water level, current velocities, and near-bed sediment concentration were collected at a single location. The time series of sediment concentration were measured with a regular OBS and an Argus Surface Meter IV (ASM). During the measurement period, flow velocities ranged between 2 and 15 cm/s, wave heights up to 1.2 m were observed and turbidity levels varied between 40 mg/l to more than 300 mg/l. The ASM data generally showed uniform concentration profiles. However, profiles with steep concentration gradients near the bed were found for wave heights above 0.5 m. The field experiments further revealed pronounced 3D structures near the bed during discrete storms. The results are generalized for a wider range of conditions and across the full water depth through application of a 1DV point model, using a two-fraction representation of the grain size distribution. The fine and coarse fractions are found to resuspend rapidly for wind speeds above 5 m/s and 10-12 m/s, respectively, forming a uniform concentration profile if these wind conditions persists. High-concentration (similar to 1 g/l) layers near the bed, containing the coarse sediment fraction, only occur at the onset and towards the end of a storm, when wind speed changes rapidly. It is under these conditions that horizontal gradients in layer density or thickness can transport considerable fine sediment. This transport provides an additional mechanism for the infill of, for instance, silt traps and navigation channels.																			1616-7341	1616-7228				MAR	2011	61	2-3			SI		187	202		10.1007/s10236-010-0322-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10236-010-0322-2													WOS:000289528200004

Assessment of lake sensitivity to acidic deposition in national parks of the Rocky Mountains	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												The sensitivity of high-elevation lakes to acidic deposition was evaluated in five national parks of the Rocky Mountains based on statistical relations between lake acid-neutralizing capacity concentrations and basin characteristics. Acid-neutralizing capacity (ANC) of 151 lakes sampled during synoptic surveys and basin-characteristic information derived from geographic information system (GIS) data sets were used to calibrate the statistical models. The explanatory basin variables that were considered included topographic parameters, bedrock type, and vegetation type. A logistic regression model was developed, and modeling results were cross-validated through lake sampling during fall 2004 at 58 lakes. The model was applied to lake basins greater than 1 ha in area in Glacier National Park (n = 244 lakes), Grand Teton National Park (n = 106 lakes), Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve (n = 11 lakes), Rocky Mountain National Park (n = 114 lakes), and Yellowstone National Park (n = 294 lakes). Lakes that had a high probability of having an ANC concentration <100 mu eq/L, and therefore sensitive to acidic deposition, are located in basins with elevations >3000 m, with <30% of the catchment having northeast aspect and with >80% of the catchment bedrock having low buffering capacity. The modeling results indicate that the most sensitive lakes are located in Rocky Mountain National Park and Grand Teton National Park. This technique for evaluating the lake sensitivity to acidic deposition is useful for designing long-term monitoring plans and is potentially transferable to other remote mountain areas of the United States and the world.

J	Wirrmann, D; Bertaux, J; Kossoni, A				Wirrmann, D; Bertaux, J; Kossoni, A			Late Holocene paleoclimatic changes in Western Central Africa inferred from mineral abundance in dated sediments from Lake Ossa (southwest Cameroon)	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Minerals derived from catchment soils were determined using FTIR spectroscopy in the well-dated core OW4 from Lake Ossa, a lowland rainforest area in Cameroon. This quantification provides a hydrologic record indicating that the magnitude of runoff events, and by inference, rainfall pattern, has varied during the Late Holocene. The comparison between minerogenic inputs and vegetation changes improves the understanding of the inferred climate dynamics. Since at least 5400 cal yr B.P., the paleomonsoon rainfall intensity decreased, as shown by a general decrease in mineral fluxes. This observation is consistent with a gradual weakening of the boreal summer insolation in tropical latitudes. However, the major vegetational change lags behind the onset of the decrease in mineral fluxes. From 2800 to ca 1000 cal yr B.P., the forest receded: the amount of rainforest taxa decreased and is replaced by pioneer trees and Poaceae, when the mineral fluxes attained their lowest values. This episode of maximum dryness is attributed to an abrupt climatic event of global significance which is superimposed onto the paleomonsoon variability. It is related to a cold event, which in turn produced a change in the lower atmospheric circulation that was characterized by a strengthening of northern trade winds, probably correlated with sea-surface temperature variations in the eastern tropical Atlantic area.

On average 36% (range 20-60) of the particulate P and 57% (range 10-100) of the surplus P were bound by bacteria. The P:C ratio of phytoplankton and bacteria varied between 2.5 and 55 (median 5.1) and 34 and 360 (median 89) .mu.g P (mg C)-1, indicating that bacteria have a substantially higher P requirement than do phytoplankton. The inverse relation found between surplus: P:C and APA: C ratios during a Microcystis aeruginosa bloom and the positive relation between P:C ratio and growth rate of the cryptophyte-dominated community in summer indicate that the phytoplankton were P limited during most of the ice-free period. This is supported by the fact that the data from the cryptophyte-dominated community could be described by the Droop model for nutrient-limited growth. For the bacteria a positive relation was found between growth rate and cellular P (i.e. the P:C and the surplus P:C ratios), as predicted by the Droop model. Although the bacteria obviously were P subsaturated, it cannot be concluded that they were P limited since C may have been supplied at an even lower rats. Because of their high P requirements the bacteria acted as consumers of inorganic P and their net consumption of P was four times higher than that of the phytoplankton.

The animals were exposed to varying levels of UV-radiation in a sunshine-simulator and the UV doses for 10 and 50% mortality (LD10, LD50) were estimated using a dose-response model. To place these doses in context they were compared with modelled clear-sky surface UV irradiances in New Zealand. The cladocerans Daphnia carinata and Ceriodaphnia dubia were sensitive to levels of UVB irradiance of LD10 = 18-25 kJ m(-2) and LD50 = 35-37 kJ m(-2). These sensitivities are consistent with published values for other cladocera. In contrast a third cladoceran, Bosmina meridionalis, exhibited no higher mortality over the full range of the cumulative UVB-doses used (3-40 kJ m(-2)) than controls receiving no UV exposure. The copepod Boeckella delicata showed the highest UV-sensitivity of all organisms tested (LD10 = 7 kJ m(-2), LD50 = 33 kJ m(-2)) whereas for Boeckella triarticulata, which was more heavily pigmented than B. delicata, no UV-induced mortality was observed. Under natural conditions UV irradiances of up to 100 kJ m(-2) day(-1) can fall on the surface of New Zealand lakes. Although this is attenuated in natural waters, these data suggest that UVB irradiance may be a significant ecological variable to some zooplankton species.					; Bodeker, Greg/A-8870-2008	Bodeker, Gregory/0000-0003-1094-5852; Hawes, Ian/0000-0003-2471-6903													0028-8330	1175-8805				SEP	2001	35	3					635	645		10.1080/00288330.2001.9517029	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.2001.9517029													WOS:000172298700018

Reduced Insecticide Susceptibility in Aedes vexans (Diptera: Culicidae) Where Agricultural Pest Management Overlaps With Mosquito Abatement	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY												Mosquito abatement programs in Midwestern communities frequently exist within landscapes dominated by agriculture. Although separately managed, both agricultural pests and mosquitoes are targeted by similar classes of insecticides. As a result, there is the potential for unintended insecticide exposure to mosquito populations from agricultural pest management. To determine the impact that agricultural management practices have on mosquito insecticide susceptibility we compared the mortality of Aedes vexans (Meigen; Diptera: Culicidae) between populations sampled from locations with and without mosquito abatement in South Dakota, a region dominated by agricultural production. Collection locations were either within towns with mosquito abatement programs (n = 2; Brookings and Sioux Falls, SD) or located > 16 km from towns with mosquito abatement programs (n = 2; areas near Harrold and Willow Lake, SD). WHO bioassays were used to test susceptibly of adults to differing insecticide classes relative to their respective controls; 1) an organochlorine (dieldrin 4%), 2) an organophosphate (malathion 5%), and 3) a pyrethroid (lambda-cyhalothrin 0.05%). Corrected mortality did not significantly differ between locations with or without abatement; however, when locations were analized by proportion of developed land within the surrounding landscape pyrethroid mortality was significantly lower where crop production dominated the surrounding landscape and mosquito abatement was present. These data suggest that agricultural pest management may incidentally contribute to reduced mosquito susceptibility where overlap between agricultural pest management and mosquito abatement exists. Decoupling insecticide classes used by both agricultural and public health pest management programs may be necessary to ensure continued efficacy of pest management tools.																			0022-2585	1938-2928				MAY	2018	55	3					747	751		10.1093/jme/tjx245	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jme/tjx245								29365158					WOS:000438231600033

Lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), white sucker (Catostomus commersoni), fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), and slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus) were abundant at the onset of acidification. A decline in the abundance of fathead minnow began in 1979 (pH 5.64), and was followed first by a rapid increase in number of pearl dace (Semotilus margarita) in 1980 (pH 5.59) and then a rapid decrease in 1982 (pH 5.09). The abundance of slimy sculpin decreased rapidly in 1979. Abundances of lake trout and white sucker increased during the early years of acidification, but declined following consecutive recruitment failures starting in 1980 for trout and in 1981 for white suckers. By 1982 recruitment had ceased for all Lake 223 fishes. Survival of lake trout .gtoreq. age 1 decreased in 1982 and 1983, but no other changes in survival of fish .gtoreq. age 1 were detected for lake trout or white sucker. By spring 1983 many lake trout were emaciated due to losses of the lake trout food organims. No changes in growth of lake trout and white suckers occurred during the initial years of acidification, but growth of lake trout slowed in 1982 and growth of the white sucker increased in 1979.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1987	44			1			114	125																WOS:A1987L149200012

The security of this water environment has a strong influence on national economic development and public health. However, data on the pollution status and potential risks due to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in this area is insufficient. In this study, we selected a branch of the Grand Canal in Hangzhou as the study subject from which 16 surface water samples were collected in the summer of 2016. The concentrations of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) (including 4 hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) and 6 dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs)), 12 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and 35 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the water samples were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Non-carcinogenic risk, carcinogenic risk, and cytotoxicity experiments were conducted to evaluate the potential health risks due to these POPs. Additionally, the toxicological data for the Danio rerio aquatic organism from the US EPA were employed for comparison with the residue from POPs in this area. The results showed that the total concentrations of HCHs, DDTs, PCBs, and PAHs were 29.937, 60.2, 8.30, and 1670.2 ng/L, respectively. Some pollutants (including acenaphthene and acenaphthylene, hepta-PCBs and tetra-PCBs, octa-PCBs and hexa-PCBs, beta-HCH and alpha-HCH, and delta-HCH and gamma-HCH) showed a correlation, which indicated they might have a similar origin. There were no non-carcinogenic risks or ecological risks for adults, children, and aquatic organisms, but a relatively low carcinogenic risk for adults presented at certain sites. The data provided here will be helpful in fully understanding the pollution status of the surface water in this branch of the Grand Canal and the potential risks from this water.

The cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene was sequenced from 23 previously unstudied populations of Grossuana from Bulgaria and analysed together with published sequences from the other populations of Grossuana from the Balkans. In Bulgaria, six clades or putative clades (lacking statistical support) were identified. Within the clades the p-distances were in the range 0.2-0.9% and between the clades 1.6-3.4%. Among all 33 studied populations, 42 haplotypes were found (haplotype diversity = 0.955; nucleotide diversity pi = 0.059). All of the haplotypes from Bulgaria and Romania formed a clade that was distinct from all of the Serbian and Greek haplotypes. At the estimated divergence time of 3.60 +/- 0.58 ma a sea connection between the Pannonian Sea and Aegean Sea (at the site of the present Velika Morava Valley) formed a dispersal barrier for these freshwater snails. The nucleotide diversity within the Bulgarian/Romanian lineage was lower (pi = 0.019, 41 polymorphic sites) that within the Serbian/Greek group (pi = 0.049, 70 polymorphic sites), perhaps as a result of bottlenecks during the Pleistocene glaciations. Within the Bulgarian populations, all of the diversity originated in the Pleistocene, during the Calabrian (estimated time 1.26-1.42 ma). During the Pleistocene, the unstable system of rivers and lakes in southwestern Bulgaria, with glaciers in the Pirin and Rila Mountains, probably resulted in the extinction of Grossuana in SW Bulgaria. Subsequently, this territory was likely recolonized from eastern Bulgarian populations.					; Hofman, Sebastian/U-4620-2018; Georgiev, Dilian/AHE-5314-2022	Osikowski, Artur/0000-0001-6646-2687; Hofman, Sebastian/0000-0001-6044-3055; 													0260-1230	1464-3766				MAY	2016	82		2				305	313		10.1093/mollus/eyv062	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mollus/eyv062													WOS:000374963300008

Coupling between primary terrestrial succession and the trophic development of lakes at Glacier Bay, Alaska	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												The natural eutrophication of lakes is still an accepted concept in limnology, arising as it does from the earliest efforts to classify lakes and place them in an evolutionary sequence. Recent studies of newly formed lakes at Glacier Bay, Alaska, only partially support this idea, and suggest more variable trends in lake trophic development which are under local (catchment-level) control. Here we use sediment cores from several lakes in Glacier Bay National Park to examine the relationship between successional changes in catchment vegetation and trends in water-column nitrogen (a limiting nutrient) and lake primary production. Terrestrial succession at Glacier Bay follows several different pathways, with older sites in the lower bay being colonized directly by spruce (Picea) and by-passing a prolonged alder (Alnus) stage that characterizes younger upper-bay sites. Sediment cores from three sites spanning this successional gradient demonstrate that the variability in nitrogen trends among lakes is a consequence of the establishment and duration of N-fixing alder in the lake catchment. In the lower-bay lakes, diatom-inferred nitrogen concentrations rise and then fall in concert with the transient appearance of alder in the catchment, while in the upper bay, high nitrogen concentrations are sustained by the continuous dominance of alder. Diatom accumulation, a proxy for whole-lake biological productivity, increases steadily at all three sites during the first century following lake formation, but declines in more recent times at the lower-bay sites in apparent response to the disappearance of alder and decreasing lake-water nitrogen. These results demonstrate a tight biogeochemical coupling between terrestrial succession and lake trophic change during the early developmental history of Glacier Bay lakes.

Ver			Persistent depositional sequences and bioevents in the Eifelian (early Middle Devonian) of eastern Laurentia: North American evidence of the Kacak Events?	DEVONIAN EVENTS AND CORRELATIONS	Geological Society Special Publication											The late Eifelian-earliest Givetian interval (Middle Devonian) represents a time of significant faunal turnover in the eastern Laurentia and globally. A synthesis of biostratigraphic, K-bentonite and sequence stratigraphic data indicates that physical and biotic events in the Appalachian foreland basin sections in New York are coeval with the predominantly carbonate platform sections of southern Ontario and Ohio. The upper Eifelian (australis to ensensis conodont zones) Marcellus subgroup in New York comprises two large-scale (3rd-order) composite depositional sequences dominated by black shale, which are here assigned to the Union Springs and Oatka Creek Formations. The succession includes portions of three distinctive benthic faunas or ecological-evolutionary sub-units (EESUs): 'Onondaga', 'Stony Hollow' and 'Hamilton'. In the northern Appalachian Basin in New York, the boundaries of these bioevents show evidence of abrupt, widespread extinctions, immigration and ecological restructuring. In the Niagara Peninsula of Ontario and from central to northern Ohio, the same sequence stratigraphic pattern and bioevents are recognized in coeval, carbonate-dominated facies. The correlations underscore a relatively simple pattern of two major sequences and four subsequences that can be recognized throughout much of eastern Laurentia. Moreover, the biotic changes appear to be synchronous across the foreland basin and adjacent cratonic platform. However, the degree of change differs substantially, being less pronounced in carbonate-dominated mid-continent sections. Finally, we make the case that the two major faunal changes align with regional sequence stratigraphic patterns as well as with the global Kacak bioevents.																			0305-8719		978-1-86239-222-9				2007	278						83	104		10.1144/SP278.4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1144/SP278.4													WOS:000268145200004

This tectonic process led to the westward subduction of the early Miocene and post-collision rifting and uplifting of the arc and subduction along the North Sulawesi Trench during the Late Miocene to the Quaternary periods. The rifting process of the North Sulawesi arc resulted in the formation of the Gorontalo graben zone in the W-E direction. There are geothermal surface manifestations near Limboto Lake, such as hot spring complexes, with temperatures ranging from 74.8 degrees C to 78.5 degrees C. To understand the geological structure and prospective geothermal characteristics beneath the investigated area, we performed integrated magnetotelluric and gravity surveys. The preferred 3D resistivity model confirmed the presence of a fault system and a graben system that was filled with conductive bodies (similar to 1-15 omega m) corresponding to alluvium deposits. This result was in accordance with the 2D density model inferred from the gravity data, where a low-density value indicates the presence of a graben zone. The conceptual model of Limboto Lake-Pentadio was constructed using the information from the MT and gravity results, and from the geological study. The conceptual model illustrates the geothermal system in Limboto Lake-Pentadio, which is controlled by the fault system and the Gorontalo graben system.

In initial toxicity (2-d post-treatment), deltamethrin provided 97% flea control and in residual toxicity it resulted in 68% control of the rodent fleas at 15-d post-treatment. The flea fauna consisted of Oropsylla montana (89.9%) and Hoplopsylls anomalus (10.1%). All rodents captured in this study were California ground squirrels, Spermophilus beecheyi. In mark-release-recapture trials, using the microchip identification implant method at the treatment site, the recapture rate of rodents was 29% from 2- to 58-d post-treatment, declining to 21% after 98 d. In the tail-clip method at the treatment site, the recapture rate of 40% at 15-d post-treatment rose to 87% and 73% at 56- and 58-d post-treatment, respectively. At the control site, the recapture rate of 100% at 15-d post-post- treatment dropped to 20% after 98 d. In another trial at Camp Cedar Crest in the Running Springs area, deltamethrin applied to rodent burrows resulted in 70% control of fleas infesting S. beecheyi. Based on the two trials, deltamethrin showed a good initial control of rodent fleas in enzootic or epizootic plague control.																			1081-1710					DEC	2004	29	2					212	217											15707280					WOS:000226589200002

However, understanding how environmental factors influence mixoplankton success across freshwater ecosystems has been uncertain. The grand & eacute;cart hypothesis (GEH) posits that light and nutrient availability are key components of mixotrophs' niche, suggesting that ecosystem properties determine opposing gradients of light and nutrients, creating environmental filtering for mixotrophs. We hypothesized that ecosystem size, a property of lake ecosystems, mediates the prevalence of patterns and control mechanisms predicted by the GEH on mixoplankton relative biomass (MRB). Using data from 98 tropical lakes, we demonstrated that lake size mediates the inverse relationship between light and nutrient availability across ecosystems. Larger lakes have more light but low nutrients, while smaller lakes have more nutrients but greater shading. Light availability better explains MRB in small lakes, and nutrients better explain MRB in large lakes, with MRB values being higher in small lakes, with secondary influence from zooplankton herbivory. Our results validate the GEH as a significant framework for explaining patterns and control mechanisms of mixoplankton across tropical lakes. This study highlights the significance of lake size as an ecosystem property that generates opposing light and nutrient gradients, further emphasizing its importance for understanding mechanisms regulating freshwater phytoplankton community structure and functioning. Integrating lake size within the conceptual framework of the GEH could aid in explaining mixoplankton success over macroecological scales.

A detailed study of the Upper Pleistocene Testina travertine, constituting the poorly lithified top part of the Lapis Tiburtinus travertines, is presented. Fieldwork performed in an area of 10 km(2) and petrographic analysis allow the recognition of six geobodies with different geometries, degree of diagenetic alteration and architectural elements, composed of seven lithotypes. The Testina travertine appears in general as a poorly lithified travertine, even if it shows a high degree of cementation. It is mainly characterised by blocky, drusy or bladed microsparite and sparite calcite cements, related to thermal and meteoric phreatic to vadose water circulation, affecting in particular those travertine deposits located in the northern part of the study area. The Testina, neglected until now in the several studies performed in the Acque Albule Basin, shows a progradational trend from the north to the south and is characterised by environments, evidencing deposition on a gentle slope, in an alluvial plain and in a shallow lake, with gradual transitions between low-energy environments and high-energy environments. Furthermore, based on correlation between the different geobodies in the overall study area, the Testina travertine depositional system was influenced by tectonic activity in the northern part, by an increasing topographic gradient and water discharge flow in the central part and by flooding events related to the Aniene River in the southern part. This study aims to differentiate such influencing factors facilitating the analysis of other travertine depositional systems and also to aid in the interpretation of subsurface analogues, as in the case of South Atlantic Pre-Salt reservoirs.

Since estuarine turbidity maxima (ETM) are sites of accumulation and transformation of this phytoplankton-derived OM, a project was undertaken to further characterize the ETM protist assemblage by collecting and analyzing bottom and surface water samples throughout an ETM event in August 2007. Biogeochemical, microscopic and molecular (18S rRNA gene clone libraries) analyses were performed. The data confirmed that the majority of the particulate OM in ETMs is derived from chl a-poor particulate organic carbon tagged by DNA that is too damaged to be detected by molecular analysis. The phylogeny of the diatoms uncovered in our clone libraries demonstrated that the fresh, labile particulate OM fraction of the ETM has a marine origin. In addition, the detection of DNA from dead Myrionecta rubra cells from red tide bloom decay in the pre-ETM bottom waters suggests a transient autochthonous input into the OM pool of estuarine bottom waters. Furthermore, the discovery of Katablepharis sequences associated with the ETM event during a period when this flagellate is not abundant in the estuary water column indicates that ETMs enable the retention of this microeukaryote within the estuarine system. These findings challenge the traditional view of freshwater-derived detritus-based turbidity maxima, and imply multiple sources of OM to the Columbia River ETMs. These ETMs are thus sites of effective transformation of freshwater, marine and estuarine OM inputs, as well as refugia for ecologically relevant protists.

Two unicellular microalgae, Chlorella sp. NTU-H15 and Chlorella sp. NTU-H25, were isolated from hog wastewater. In the laboratory, they were able to grow up even in aeration containing CO2 UP to 40% and have growth rates of 0.21 to 0.22 g dry wt l(-1) d(-1) at 20% CO2. Both algae had the same growth rate in the range from 5 to 40% CO2 and had a similar light response between 190 and 589 mumol m(-2) s(-1). Chlorella sp. NTU-H15 had a higher growth rate than Chlorella sp. NTU-H25 at pH 4.0 and greater than or equal to35degreesC. Chlorella sp. NTU-H15 was able to tolerate high concentrations of CO2, high cell density, and a broad-range of temperature and pH. Each liter of Chlorella sp. NTU-H15 produced 1.8 g of dry cell. The maximum growth rate was 0.28 g dry wt l(-1)d(-1), and the specific growth rate was 0.27 d(-1) at 15% CO2. Each mg of chlorophyll produced 1.6 mM O-2 min(-1) at 700 mumol m(-2) s(-1) at 30degreesC and 10 mM NaHCO3. While each liter of Chlorella sp. NTU-H25 produced 1.7 g of dry cell, the maximum growth rate was 0.27 g dry wt l(-1) d(-1), and the specific growth rate was 0.27 d(-1). Both isolates are suitable for dense cultivation to fix CO2 directly and to produce cell biomass.																			0006-8063					JAN	2003	44	1					43	52																WOS:000181189500007

Concentrations of glucose (1350, 975, 600,300, 150, and 37.5 mu mol CL-1) and nitrate (150, 300, and 9000 mu mol N L-1) were used in a range of combinations giving 9 different treatments of glucose:nitrate. In the microcosm without the bacterial mixture, M. aeruginosa abundance gradually increased with days in all treatments. However, M. aeruginosa had much lower density in some treatments with the bacterial mixture. The difference in M. aeruginosa growth could be explained by competition with bacteria in the cultures in which these were added. The abundance of M. aeruginosa and bacteria when grown together was nearly equal and the number of the bacterial species was highest in the treatment with 300 mu mol C L-1 and 150 mu mol N L-1. Our results suggest that at this glucose:nitrate ratio M. aeruginosa and the bacterial mixture maintain a balance, and bacteria maintain diversity. In conclusion, we propose that dissolved organic carbon and nitrate availability fundamentally affects the structure as well as stoichiometry of pelagic associations. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

Planktothrbc rubescens is a planktonic cyanobacterium that frequently causes blooms in temperate (mostly mesotrophic) lakes in Europe and, unlike other cyanobacteria, it is usually associated with ecosystem reoligotrophication. The potential effects of P. rubescens on periphyton development have not been estimated in any recently published studies. The objective of the present paper was to assess how a Planktohrix rubescens bloom affects periphyton development in a temperate freshwater reservoir. A field study was performed in the Vrutci reservoir (western Serbia), where P. rubescens blooms have occurred since December of 2013. Periphyton was grown on glass slides that were incubated following lake stratification and sampled monthly from July to October of 2015. Dry mass, ash free dry mass and content of chlorophyll a, as well as composition of the community of developed periphyton, were estimated, together with P. rubescens biomass in the water column at the particular depths where substrates for periphyton were incubated. The metalimnetic bloom of P. rubescens induced calcite precipitation on the incubated substrates, which was reflected in obstructed colonization. The periphyton community composition was mainly determined by the depth gradient, which was potentially related to reduced light availability driven by shading effects caused by the P.rubescens bloom. Our results provide a significant update on periphyton ecology in relation to cyanobacterial blooms, elucidating complex interactions in the ecosystem. They also represent a stimulus for further studies on the capacity of P. rubescens for induction of calcium carbonate precipitation in lakes.

We apply regional calibration sets to quantitatively reconstruct mean July air temperature (using chironomids and diatoms) and lake-water pH (using diatoms). Both chironomids and diatoms infer highest temperatures (1.7-2.3degreesC above present-day estimates, including, a correction for glacio-isostatic land up-lift by 0.6degreesC) during the early Holocene (c. 9,500-8,500 cal. yrs BP). Diatoms suggest a decreasing lake-water pH trend (c. 0.6 pH units) since the early Holocene. Using detrended canonical correspondence analysis (DCCA), we compare the Holocene development of diatom communities in Lake Njulla with four other nearby lakes (Lake 850, Lake Tibetanus, Vuoskkujavri, Vuolep Njakajaure) located along an altitudinal gradient. All five lakes show similar initial DCCA scores after deglaciation, suggesting that similar environmental processes such as high erosion rates and low light availability associated with high summer temperature appear to have regulated the diatom community, favouring high abundances of Fragilaria species. Subsequently, the diatom assemblages develop in a directional manner, but timing and scale of development differ substantially between lakes. This is attributed primarily to differences in the local geology, which is controlling the lake-water pH. Imposed on the basic geological setting, site-specific processes such as vegetation development, climate, hydrological setting and in-lake processes appear to control lake development in northern Sweden.					; Hall, Roland/K-3165-2019; Bigler, Christian/C-4002-2008; Jeziorski, Adam/AAJ-6982-2020	Jeziorski, Adam/0000-0001-7701-7247; Hall, Roland/0000-0002-0314-6449; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				JAN	2003	29	1					13	29		10.1023/A:1022850925937	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1022850925937													WOS:000183141800002

The primary goals of the study were estimation of water-soluble contents of heavy metal, estimation of pollution indices, and source apportionment of water-soluble contents of heavy metals using UNMIX model from the road dust of Zhengzhou city. To accomplish this, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) was used to determine concentrations of eight heavy metals (Cr, Cu, Ni, Zn, Cd, As, Pb, and Hg), and it has been observed that Cu and Zn were the metals with the highest concentration, while Hg, Cd, and Pb were in the lowest concentration range of metals. Pollution indices, geo-accumulation index (I-geo), contamination factor (CF), and Nemerow synthetic pollution index (PIN) were calculated to assess the contamination level of water-soluble contents of these hazardous heavy metals. I-geo classified the contamination risk into a spectrum of categories ranging from unpolluted (Cr and Pb) to high polluted (Cu and Cd). For the CF results, the concentration of Cr and Pb was found to be low, similar to I-geo, while the concentrations of three heavy metals, Cu, Cd, and Hg, were found to be extremely high or excessive. The results of the PIN assessment indicated that there was an enormous risk of Hg contamination in the city and that Cu, Cd, and Zn were all within a few percent of the Hg pollution level and hence fell into the high pollution group. The UNMIX model was used for source apportionment of dissolved heavy metals and showed: Source 1 (natural sources, 10%), Source 2 (copper mine tailing contamination, 19%), and Source 3 (agricultural activities22%). Source 4 accounted for (air pollution, 15%) of the total and Source 5 accounted for (industrial activity, 34%). It is imperative that immediate and comprehensive pollution control and preventive measures be implemented in the city due to the presence of metal in the dust.					wang, huiliang/AAP-3859-2021; Faisal, Muhammad/IUP-1390-2023; Muzammil, Muhammad/AAY-9501-2020; Azam, Muhammad/ADY-9102-2022	Azam, Engr.

J	Izaguirre, I; Allende, L; Tell, G				Izaguirre, I; Allende, L; Tell, G			Algal communities of a geothermally heated lagoon on Deception Island (South Shetland Islands)	POLAR BIOLOGY												Kroner Lake, located at Deception Island (Maritime Antarctica), is a unique geothermally heated lagoon in Antarctica. It is declared as special site of scientific interest (SSSI) by Scientific Committee for Antarctic Research (SCAR) for its high biodiversity. A sharp environmental heterogeneity is registered in this lagoon, due to its connection to the sea in its southern margin, and to the input of warm freshwater in the northern one (because of hot springs). This study analyses the biodiversity and abundance of the algal communities (phytoplankton and benthic assemblages) and their relationship with environmental factors. In particular, strong spatial differences of both temperature and conductivity were recorded. The biological studies revealed that the phytoplankton (nanoplankton and microplankton) was dominated by marine diatom species, while the pico-sized fraction was composed by Cyanobacteria Synechococcus-like cells. The epipelon was mainly represented by chain and tubicolous diatoms, among which, Melosira nummuloides was one of the most abundant species. Filamentous Cyanobacteria were also frequently recorded in the algal mats. Kroner Lake is subject to a strong marine influence. Phytoplankton is absolutely dominated by marine diatoms. Spatial variations in temperature and conductivity recorded in the lagoon influence the distribution of the aquatic communities. The greater abundance of pico-sized cells coincided with the warmest site of the water body. Regarding the benthic community, the contribution of freshwater and brackish species is comparatively more important than for the phytoplankton, although the high contribution of marine-derived algae was also evident.																			0722-4060	1432-2056				APR	2006	29	5					364	371		10.1007/s00300-005-0065-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00300-005-0065-6													WOS:000236417000003

Our objectives were to determine the effects of sampling frequency on diet variance and on estimated prey consumption by the fish population. Sampling frequency ranged from 2 to 30 samples per 45-d sampling period in summer 1987. We determined the mean variance of an index of relative importance for each of six prey types as a function of sampling frequency. Estimates of mean rates of total population food consumption (based on percent wet weights of each prey type) were calculated with a generalized bioenergetics model. Feeding on each of three prey items (i.e., zooplankton, chironomids, and trichopterans) fluctuated irregularly over time, and intervals of 3-18 d between feeding bouts were determined from the data. Sampling frequency influenced the accuracy of consumption rate estimates. A minimum sampling frequency of three times per 45 d was necessary for accurate estimates of consumption rates for Chaoborus spp., for odonate naiads, and possibly for ephemeropterans. However, accurate estimates of consumption rates for zooplankton (Daphnia spp. and Holopedium gibberum), trichopterans, and chironomid pupae required more frequent sampling. Increased sampling did not decrease the intersample variance, but the error in estimates of consumption rates decreased with increased sampling frequency.

J	Bertram, GCL; Lack, D				Bertram, GCL; Lack, D			On the animal ecology of Bear Island	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												This Arctic island between Norway and Spitzbergen has a low summer temp.; the temp. of lakes and among plants is several degrees higher than that of the air. The humidity is high, probably accounting for the abundance of mosses and lichens, and of Collembola and Acarina. Flying insects are active only on the very few warm days. The Arthropods are classified into 4 habitat groups which do not correspond with the plant communities. The avifauna and part of the arthropod fauna are more southern in character than that of Spitzbergen although some more northern arthropod types are present. All of the fauna could have colonized post-glacially, aerially or on the ice, although a few Arthropods might represent a pre-glacial element. Colonization is still continuing. The number of spp. present is low, but their abundance is often great. Arctic foxes, together with extent of inaccessible nesting-sites, may limit the number of guillemots and eiders, but the severe and fluctuating climate, affecting both mortality and fecundity, may be responsible for the reduced predator-prey relationships. An appendix lists as occurring on the island the following numbers of spp.: mammals, 2; birds, possibly breeding, 26; fish, 1; Collembola, 14; Trichop-tera, 1; Lepidoptera, 1; Coleoptera, 5; Hymenoptera, 8; Diptera, 22; Branchiopoda, 7; Araneida, 1; Acarina, 32.

Nuri; Balta, Fikri			Locational classification of walnut (Juglans regia L.) genotypes collected from Lake Van basin by using mixture modeling	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH												In mixture modeling, it is assumed that the data set shows a heterogeneous structure. This heterogeneity is defined as unobservable heterogeneity. The data set's heterogeneity produces serious deviations in the parameter estimates and the standard deviations. Heterogeneity is overcome when the data set divides itself into homogeneous sub-populations. Thus, while homogeneity is attained for sub-populations, the heterogeneity between the sub-populations is tried to be put forward. Akaike's information criteria (AIC), Bayesian information criteria (BIC), and Entropy classification criteria are used to determine the number of sub-populations. After the number of sub-populations is determined, the model determines the probability that each observation will fall within a particular sub-population. In this study, the classification of districts based on fruit traits is achieved by applying mixture modeling to walnut fruits collected from eight districts. According to the AIC, BIC, and entropy criteria, a model with five sub-populations was chosen where the data set is the most distributed. Therefore, it was determined that each district does not form a different population according to the studied walnut fruit traits, but are distributed into five sub-populations. The fourth sub-population had the most desirable traits for walnut improvement, and the highest proportion of these traits came from the naturally grown populations of Adilcevaz and Ahlat districts.					; Kaki, Baris/K-7470-2012	ALMALI, Mehmet Nuri/0000-0003-2763-4452; 													1991-637X					JUN 18	2010	5	12					1509	1514																WOS:000280348600020
J	Earl, JE; Semlitsch, RD				Earl, Julia E.; Semlitsch, Raymond D.			Spatial Subsidies, Trophic State, and Community Structure: Examining the Effects of Leaf Litter Input on Ponds	ECOSYSTEMS												In aquatic systems, light and subsidy input often co-vary along a canopy cover gradient. This creates systems where subsidies are more prevalent in areas with low primary productivity and less prevalent in areas with high primary productivity. We expect ecosystem processes and community structure to respond to these changes in resources. We examined the effects of light and subsidy input (leaf litter) on ponds by placing pond mesocosms along a canopy gradient and manipulating litter input. We then sampled mesocosms for ecosystem and community parameters for 2 years during April (pre-leaf out), July (full canopy), and November (start of leaf fall). Neither canopy cover nor litter input tended to dominate effects overall, highlighting the importance of the light-subsidy gradient combination that is frequently encountered in temperate aquatic systems. Ponds shifted from an autotrophy/heterotrophy balance to net heterotrophy with increasing canopy cover in concordance with our predictions. Although litter input affected dissolved oxygen, we did not detect an effect of litter on trophic state, primary production, or community respiration. We additionally found effects of both canopy cover and litter input on community composition, but very differently than that found in streams. In general, the grazer and shredder macroinvertebrate functional feeding groups were rare in the pond mesocosms, and thus did not respond to treatments. The collector proportion of the community, mainly chironomids, increased with canopy cover and was higher in mesocosms with litter input than those without. Contrary to predictions, there were few differences between subsidy input type (leaves or grass) despite differences in litter quality. This study, along with many others, highlights the importance of canopy gradients in determining ecosystem function and community composition.

J	Jabbari, E; Fathi, M; Moradi, M				Jabbari, Ehsan; Fathi, Mahsa; Moradi, Mojtaba			Modeling groundwater quality and quantity to manage water resources in the Arak aquifer, Iran	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												Groundwater resources are increasingly exposed to significant overexploitation in many parts of the world, markedly in Iran, one of the most arid areas. The objective of the present study is to investigate the changes in groundwater levels and quality in the Arak aquifer. Groundwater fluctuation contour line maps provided in Geographic Information System (GIS) during 2006 to 2017 in this area indicate that excessive extraction of wells has led to major decline in water levels and a marked increase in concentration of total dissolved solids (TDS). The Groundwater Modeling System (GMS)-a three-dimensional MODFLOW model-paired with MT3D, was utilized to survey the aquifer characterization in the area. In the first step, the conceptual model was developed, and the calibration in both steady and transient states showed that the error between calculated and observed levels was in optimal level. Subsequently, two scenarios were considered to simulate quantity changes in the aquifer: simulation in drought and rainfall reduction and simulation with a 30% increase in well extraction. The results indicate that during both the drought period and increasing exploiting from the pumping wells, the level of water has fallen by more than 5 m. Finally, the calculated hydraulic heads and velocity of flow of ground water in the aquifer are retrieved in the mass transport modeling package MT3D to find the concentration of TDS in the groundwater. Simulation results indicate that concentration of TDS is with far more amount in the areas around the lake located in central parts due to evaporation of Meighan wetland and geological structure of the region. Scenarios considered for prediction by transport model indicate that concentration of TDS would increase if the current situation continues; however, this is mainly influenced by hydrology and geology of the area.																			1866-7511	1866-7538				JUL 15	2020	13	14							663	10.1007/s12517-020-05681-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12517-020-05681-4													WOS:000553125800002
J	Zhu, SF; Cui, H; Jia, Y; Zhu, XM; Tong, H; Ma, LC				Zhu, Shifa; Cui, Hang; Jia, Ye; Zhu, Xiaomin; Tong, Huan; Ma, Lichi			Occurrence, composition, and origin of analcime in sedimentary rocks of non-marine petroliferous basins in China	MARINE AND PETROLEUM GEOLOGY												Natural analcime, a highly brittle aluminosilicate mineral that dissolves easily during diagenesis, occurs in the sedimentary rocks of eight main non-marine petroliferous basins in China. This mineral has been well documented for the past 30 years and has proved to be significant for the formation of high-quality hydrocarbon reservoirs. The present study fully reviews analcime occurrences, chemical compositions, Si/Al ratios, origin and controlling factors, and influence on the hydrocarbon reservoir quality in Permian to Paleogene sedimentary rocks. Previous research has shown that analcime is commonly distributed within argillaceous laminae (1-type); occurs as intergranular cement (c-type), replacement (r-type), and crack filling (f-type) forms; or is closely intergrown with other authigenic/exhalative minerals (a-type). Analcime in lacustrine basins is slightly Al-rich and Na-poor, and its Si/Al ratios range from 1.95 to 2.80. The geochemical compositions of the analcime- and ankerite-bearing exhalites are characterised by enrichment in light rare earth elements and C-13 and depletion in heavy rare earth elements and O-18, with negative Eu and positive Ce anomalies. Diagenetic analcime forms by the alteration of volcanic glass, clays, or zeolite precursors in saline-alkaline lakes or during buried diagenetic stages in sedimentary rocks. In addition, it coexists with other authigenic zeolite, carbonate, and clay minerals as well as albite. Hydrothermal analcime presumably precipitates from hydrothermal fluids and is not dependent on a local precursor mineral or volcanic glass; this type is commonly related to exhalative mineralisation of hydrothermal springs. The formation of natural analcime is controlled by various factors such as the composition of the parent material, temperature prevalent during crystallisation, chemistry of the fluid phase, and thermodynamic characteristics of the geological environment. As zeolites are formed in alkaline fluid phases, they become unstable in acidic pore water. Secondary pores created by analcime mineral dissolution, and inter-crystalline micropores among analcime minerals, are highly significant in hydrocarbon reservoirs. Analcime-bearing mudstone, siltstone, dolostone, and exhalite are favourable lithofacies for unconventional hydrocarbon accumulation owing to its high brittleness and selective dissolution of analcime and other associated minerals.

Temporally constrained eolian sand signals and their relationship to climate, Oxbow Lake, Saugatuck, Michigan	COASTLINE AND DUNE EVOLUTION ALONG THE GREAT LAKES	Geological Society of America Special Papers											Interrelationships among late Holocene climate, the dynamics of coastal dunes and sedimentation in adjacent small lakes along coasts of the upper Great Lakes have been studied for over a decade. Nonetheless, many questions remain as to relationships between climate variability and dune activity. The study site is Oxbow Lake, near Saugatuck, Michigan, which formed as an artificial cutoff of the Kalamazoo River in 1906. Stratigraphic control of the infilled western end of the lake is from ground penetrating radar, and lake sediment from Livingstone and Glew cores with age control from Pb-210/Cs-137/Be-7 analysis. The climate data used included Lake Michigan water levels and temperature, precipitation, drought and evaporation data from a weather station 30 km to the south and wind data from buoys on Lake Michigan. Episodic peaks of eolian sand in the lake sediment are interpreted to be sourced from adjacent small parabolic dunes along the shoreline and from a foredune west of the lake. Linear regressions of the climate data and weight percent sand resulted in a variety of correlations, some conflicting, and with uncertain meanings. It was found through visual correlation that peaks in sand correspond with both peaks in water levels of Lake Michigan and the winter Palmer drought severity index. The implications of this research are that dune activity is linked to periods of wet conditions and storminess, contrary to typical eolian environments, but consistent with other studies in temperate coastal dunes along the Great Lakes. Results can be used as a modern analogue for coastal dune activity during times of high lake level.

Mean DNA-DNA relatedness values between strain ISL-24(T) and V. carmonensis DSM 14868(T) and V. necropolis DSM 14866(T) were 11 and 19%, respectively. Differential phenotypic properties of strain ISL-24(T), together with the phylogenetic and genetic distinctiveness, revealed that this strain is different from recognized Virgibacillus species. On the basis of phenotypic, phylogenetic and genetic data, strain ISL-24(T) represents a novel species of the genus Virgibacillus, for which the name Virgibacillus byunsanensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is ISL-24(T) (=KCTC 13259(T) =CCUG 56754(T)).

J	Toivonen, H; Huttunen, P				Toivonen, H; Huttunen, P			Aquatic macrophytes and ecological gradients in 57 small lakes in southern Finland	AQUATIC BOTANY												Records made in the late 1970s in 57 small (0.5-200 ha) lakes in southern Finland (about 61 degrees 30'N) were used to examine ecological gradients, species assemblages, and two a priori classifications of lakes. The a priori groupings were: (1) general limnological types (hypertrophic, eutrophic, clear-water meso-eutrophic, mesotrophic, clear-water oligotrophic and brown-water oligotrophic lakes); (2) the traditional Finnish botanical lake type classification. The material was classified with TWIN-SPAN and ordinated with detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). The species richness and the occurrence of various growth forms vary greatly, being highest in the clear-water meso-eutrophic and eutrophic lakes, and lowest in brown-water oligotrophic waters. For helophytes, however, species richness was highest in eutrophic and hypertrophic lakes. The trophic state (indicated by the specific conductivity and the summer water pH) determines the occurrence of many helophyte species; for hydrophytes the principal determinants are trophic state and water transparency. There was a relatively good correspondence between the results of multivariate analyses and a priori classifications of lakes, especially in most nutrient-poor and nutrient-rich, as well as in some clear-water lakes. The mesotrophic and eutrophic lake categories, do, however, overlap widely. The ordination diagrams indicate an ecological continuum, and only relative importance of lake classifications. Ninety-four macrophyte species separate into a few main groups along the oligotrophy-eutrophy gradient.																			0304-3770					AUG	1995	51	3-4					197	221		10.1016/0304-3770(95)00458-C	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(95)00458-C													WOS:A1995UD23100002

Simulation of the ice regime in a Norwegian regulated river	COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												River ice models are commonly used to study ice conditions in wide and low-gradient rivers in cold regions. However, examples of applications of these tools in shallow and fast-flowing rivers are rarely reported. In this study, the one-dimensional model MIME-Ice was applied to study the ice regime of the regulated river Orkla in Norway. The river Orkla is characterized as a steep and shallow river with sequences of pools and riffles throughout its length. The model was calibrated and validated for the winters, 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 respectively. The study shows that the model is applicable in a steep river with transects of both subcritical and supercritical flow conditions, which is a different environment than most previously reported applications of river ice models. The simulated hydrodynamics and water temperature show good agreement with observations. The model was further tested on its ability to simulate the presence/absence of frazil ice and the development of an ice cover at observation points in the river using continuous monitoring with cameras. The ability to correctly simulate the ice cover extent of the entire model domain was also tested based on a number of field campaigns. The ice simulation results correspond well with observations both spatially and temporally. Further, two discharge scenarios were simulated: a) No hydropower regulation, and b) reduced hydropower operation: to assess the impact of the regulation and to explore the sensitivity of the model. The simulation results demonstrate how hydropower regulation has altered the thermal and ice regimes. The study concludes that Mike-Ice is a useful tool for predicting the river regime in the river Orkla, where dynamic ice formation is a dominant process. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

J	Ngos, S; Giresse, P				Ngos, Simon, III; Giresse, Pierre			The Holocene sedimentary and pyroclastic accumulations of two crater lakes (Mbalang, Tizong) of the volcanic plateau of Adamawa (Cameroon): Palaeoenvironmental reconstruction	HOLOCENE												This paper presents the results from field observations, geochemical and mineralogical analyses, radiocarbon dating and magnetic susceptibility of the Holocene sediments of two crater lakes, Mbalang and Tizong, located within the woody savanna of the Adamawa Plateau (Cameroon). In the Mbalang core (M4) with an age of 7318 cal. BP at the base, the first 2000 years record indicates a relatively wet climate deduced from the recurrence of quartzrich sandy microbeds. The next millennia are marked by a monotonous sedimentation interpreted as a relatively dry phase. The accumulation rate falls from 1.00-1.40 to 0.70 mm/yr in the last 100 years. The base of the Tizong core (T2) is dated to 4105 cal. BP. The sedimentation is frequently interrupted by interstratifications of pyroclastic beds from c. 3263 to 1391 cal. BP, well evidenced by their high magnetic susceptibility values. The high accumulation rate (1.58 mm/yr) integrates both allochthonous volcanic ashes and autochthonous intense proliferation of Chlorophyceaea. The Ngaoundere region, in the southern forest region, reveals a humid phase between c. 7943 and 5603 cal. BP. The later long-lasting dry tendency makes it difficult to particularly distinguish the c. 3210-1945 cal. BP dry periods recorded in the forest region of Cameroon. Nevertheless, signs from Mbalang pollens and Tizong waters bear witness to an important drying tendency during this period. In Lake Chad, after the successive highest lake levels recorded between c. 8500 and 6300 cal. BP, the level of this lake was declining for the last three millennia.																			0959-6836	1477-0911				JAN	2012	22	1					31	42		10.1177/0959683611409779	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683611409779													WOS:000298353900004

Meteorological validation of chironomids as a paleotemperature proxy using varved lake sediments	HOLOCENE												In order to improve the reliability of climate models in their projections for the future, spatially and temporally detailed paleoclimate proxy data are needed. In this study, we examined annually laminated sediments from Lake Nurmijarvi (Finland) for their fossil Chironomidae assemblages over a time period with available meteorological observational data (since 1830s). In doing so, we correlated chironomid-based inferences of summer air temperatures against instrumentally measured values using two different reconstruction approaches, namely, calibration-in-space (CiS, multilake training set) and calibration-in-time (CiT, calibration of time series data against meteorological data). The results showed that the principal variability in fossil chironomid assemblages in the sediment core corresponded to the measured air temperatures. In addition, the temperatures reconstructed using CiS (R = 0.38, p = 0.014) and CiT (R = 0.51, p = 0.001) correlated significantly with the meteorological data; however, the CiS approach showed higher variability and larger differences against the instrumentally measured values. A significant lag of on average 4-8 years was also found in the chironomid response to observed temperature change that is, nevertheless, much shorter time span than with some other paleoclimate proxies. The results verify the usability and sensitivity of chironomids as a paleoclimate proxy in the Nurmijarvi varved sediment record with the potential value of an exceptionally well-resolved downcore record of the Holocene climate change in the future. The CiT approach can potentially provide accurate paleotemperature estimates at the late-Holocene scale, but the CiS approach may be more useful at longer timescales if the community compositions change significantly from those occurring during the calibration period of the CiT.

The primary objective was to investigate climatic variations and environmental changes before, during and after the Little Ice Age (LIA) in the central Andes, with particular emphasis on precipitation patterns and their relation to solar forcing. The extracted core provided a continuous sedimentary archive, offering insights into climate variability on subcentennial to inter-decadal timescales. The methodology included analysing the sediment cores using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) to measure the concentrations of allogenic elements such as titanium (Ti), silicon (Si), potassium (K), iron (Fe) and calcium (Ca). Ti/coh ratios served as proxy for effective rainfall and runoff from the local catchment. In addition, pollen and non-pollen palynomorphs (NPPs) were identified and quantified to reconstruct past vegetation and climatic conditions. The study revealed that lithogenic input to the LC increased significantly after 1150 cal yr AD, likely due to increased precipitation. In particular, periods of increased lithogenic input were identified during the LIA, corresponding to solar minima and pointing to solar forcing as a major driver of precipitation changes in the central Andes.					; Reindel, Markus/HGD-0736-2022	Reindel, Markus/0000-0003-1223-304X; 													1040-6182	1873-4553				FEB 1	2025	718								109647	10.1016/j.quaint.2024.109647	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2024.109647		JAN 2025											WOS:001413875100001

This meteorite exhibits substantial similarities to Tagish Lake, Wisconsin Range 91600, and Meteorite Hills 00432, which are generally considered to have originated from a D-type asteroid(s). We constrain the compositions and petrologies of the materials present in a potential sample of a D-type asteroid by reporting the petrography, bulk chemical compositions, bulk H, C, N, Cr, and Ti isotopic compositions, reflectance spectra, and in situ chemical compositions of metals, sulfides, carbonates, and FeO-poor and FeO-rich chondrule silicates of Tarda. We also present new data for Tagish Lake. We then compare Tarda with the other Tagish Lake-like meteorites. Tarda and Tagish Lake appear to be from the same parent body, as demonstrated by their similar petrologies (modal abundances, chondrule sizes), mineral compositions, bulk chemical and isotopic compositions, and reflectance spectra. While the two other Tagish Lake-like meteorites, Wisconsin Range 91600 and Meteorite Hills 00432, show some affinities to Tagish Lake and Tarda, they also share similar characteristics to the Mighei-like carbonaceous (CM) chondrites, warranting further study. Similarities in reflectance spectra suggest that P-type asteroids 65 Cybele and 76 Freia are potential parent bodies of Tarda and the Tagish Lake-like meteorites, or at least have similar surface materials. Since upcoming spacecraft missions will spectrally survey D-type, P-type, and C-type Trojan asteroids (NASA's Lucy) and spectrally study and return samples from Mars' moon Phobos (JAXA's Martian Moons eXploration mission), which is spectrally similar to D-type asteroids, these meteorites are of substantial scientific interest. Furthermore, since Tarda closely spectrally matches P-type asteroids (but compositionally matches the D-type asteroid like Tagish Lake meteorite), P-type and D-type asteroids may represent fragments of the same or similar parent bodies.

Ecotones between tropical forests and lakes compose an ecosystem interconnection with a high abundance of terrestrial invertebrates, which represent an outstanding resource for the aquatic fauna. However, there is still little quantitative information on tropical forest contribution in terms of invertebrate inputs into lacustrine systems and the factors controlling this flux. 2. To quantify the terrestrial invertebrate contribution into tropical lakes, we selected six lakes located in the Atlantic rainforest, south-eastern Brazil, and used pan traps placed in the lakeshore. We focused on total abundance, biomass, and richness of insect orders. To assess the influence of forest and lake morphometry on terrestrial invertebrate inputs into lakes, we measured the forest-lake distance and considered the morphometric characteristics of each lake. 3. Distance from forest negatively affected the invertebrate biomass reaching the lakes. The dissimilarity across different ecotones also increased with distance from the forest. Perimeter-to-area ratio negatively affected the invertebrate abundance, suggesting that more dendritic lakes receive more invertebrates from the forest. 4. We estimated that annually, on average 21 tons of terrestrial invertebrates fall into the studied lakes, representing a massive food resource for the aquatic ecosystem. Hence, if the distance from the forest increases due, for instance, to severe drought or deforestation, it will create an herbaceous environment unable to provide such a quantity of insects to the water ecosystems, compromising aquatic and terrestrial trophic webs dynamics.

Speciation in Cisco with Emphasis on Secondary Contacts, Plasticity, and Hybridization	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The CiscoCoregonus artediis a planktivorous fish that is widely distributed in lakes across glaciated areas of North America. With retreat of Laurentide ice, Cisco dispersed from refugia into a vast network of meltwater (proglacial) lakes that eventually receded, stranding populations in depressions-today's lakes. Refugial populations also colonized lakes that fell outside of the footprint of a proglacial lake. These two types of Cisco lakes, those inside the footprint of a proglacial lake and those outside the footprint, though uncounted, number in the high hundreds or more. All 53 lakes reported to contain sympatric forms of Cisco occur in previously inundated lakes; no sympatric forms occur in lakes that were not inundated. We reviewed Laurentide zoogeography to assess whether secondary contacts in the proglacial lakes were extensive enough to account for the distribution of sympatric lakes. We concluded that secondary contacts had been more extensive in the proglacial lakes than detected in genetic studies of Cisco. We inferred that secondary contacts in the proglacial lakes resulted in more plastic, diverse phenotypes than were found in lakes not inundated and that these phenotypes were more capable of divergence than were phenotypes inhabiting lakes not inundated. Secondary contacts in the proglacial lakes appear to have been limited to shallow-water forms of Cisco. Deepwater forms likely did not evolve until after the proglacial lakes receded, as meltwater appears to have been trophically unsuitable for pelagic fishes like Cisco. Cisco are assumed to have colonized meltwater lakes by "hopscotching" between inlets, thereby avoiding prolonged existence in meltwater. Sympatric populations of Cisco are rare in comparison with the number of allopatric populations, even in inundated lakes, indicating that divergence occurs under specialized conditions. Canalization appears to have diminished the evolvability of contemporary forms as compared to their ancestors. Hybridization within Cisco species pairs appears to be the norm and is aggravated by anthropogenically induced events.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				NOV	2020	149	6					721	740		10.1002/tafs.10267	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tafs.10267		OCT 2020											WOS:000579516400001
J	Quinn, JW				Quinn, Jeffrey W.			A Survey of Bowfishing Tournaments in Arkansas	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Bowfishing is an understudied method of fishing that appears to be legal throughout the United States. Therefore, species composition and harvest rates were determined at six bowfishing tournaments held in Arkansas at the lower White River, the Arkansas River at Lake Dardanelle, the Arkansas River at Piney Bay, Lake DeGray, Bull Shoals Lake, and Lake Ouachita between July 1999 and May 2000. A total of 3,280 fish were harvested at the six tournaments; of this total, 2,751 fish representing 19 species were identified. Total harvest per tournament ranged from 179 to 1,674 fish and from 6 to 12 species. Mean (+/-SD) harvest rate for tournament participants was 3.8 +/- 1.1 fish/h; among tournament winners, the harvest rate was 7.7 + 2.8 fish/h, which appears high compared with other sport fisheries (range = 0.28-2.59 fish/h). Five species accounted for 84% of fish harvested: spotted gar Lepisosteus oculatus, common carp Cyprinus carpio, shortnose gar L. platostomus, spotted sucker Minytrema melanops, and smallmouth buffalo Ictiobus bubalus. Rank number of each species harvested at the tournaments was correlated (P < 0.05) for only 4 of 15 pairwise comparisons, which suggests that harvest often varies by tournament. Tournaments held at the Arkansas and White rivers had correlated harvest, as did spring tournaments held at the Ouachita River drainage reservoirs (i.e., Lake DeGray and Lake Ouachita). Harvest of fish smaller than published size-at-maturity estimates was generally not problematic but appeared to be of greatest concern for smaller-bodied catostomid species. This study indicates that tournament bowfishers have higher harvest rates than traditional rod-and-reel anglers. Results of this survey should provide baseline information that may assist natural resource agencies with management of bowfishing.																			0275-5947					DEC	2010	30	6					1376	1384		10.1577/M10-008.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M10-008.1													WOS:000286421000003

Documentation of a Massive Fish Die Off on Grand Lake St. Marys, with Notes on Longterm Changes in Fish Assemblage and Watershed Habitat Over the Past Century	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												We assessed a large-scale fish die off event resultant of prolonged anoxic conditions on Grand Lake St. Marys in west central Ohio, U.S., during the summer of 2020, and used this as the basis for comparing long-term species diversity in the lake over the past century. Fish collections were made along a series of shoreline and open water transects, totaling approximately 1.5% of the entire 5220 ha lake area (majority of surveys were shoreline), wherein we identified a total of 12,351 fish comprised of 25 taxa. We used this die off event, combined with recent near shore seine survey data, as an opportunity to assess the modern assemblage structure and to serve as a reference point to prior collected data over the past century. Combining these recent data with historical records, we found that although 57 species have been recorded from the lake dating back to the mid-1800s, only 30 taxa are known to inhabit the lake today. Some of the lost taxa predictably include more intolerant species from the Darter (Percidae), Minnow (Cyprinidae), and Sucker (Catostomidae) families; however, there were also instances of increases in taxa resulting from both state stocking efforts (e.g. Flathead Catfish, Pylodictis olivaris) and natural distribution expansions (e.g. Freshwater Drum, Aplodinotus grunniens). Overall, we attribute the changes to the fish assemblage as negative, given no intolerant taxa currently inhabit the lake. We attribute these long-term changes to watershed wide destruction of natural forest, wetland, and prairie habitats that once typified the region.																			0003-0031	1938-4238				JAN	2022	187	1					104	112		10.1674/0003-0031187.1.104	http://dx.doi.org/10.1674/0003-0031187.1.104													WOS:000739647800011

This study proposed a novel kernel extreme learning machine model coupled with the K-means clustering and firefly algorithms (Kmeans-FFA-KELM) with 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 and 40 data subsets for estimating monthly mean daily ET0 in parallel computation in the Poyang Lake basin of South China with pooled temperature data from 26 weather stations. Two input combinations, i.e. (1) mean temperature (Tavg) and extraterrestrial radiation (Ra), (2) maximum and minimum temperatures (T-max and T-min) and Ra, were considered. Meteorological data during 1966-2000 were used to train the models, while those for the period 2001-2015 were used for model testing. The results showed that the prediction accuracy of selected machine learning models with Tmax, Tmin and Ra was improved by 7.0-15.5% in terms of RMSE compared to that with Tavg and Ra during testing. The FFA-KELM model slightly outperformed the adaptive network based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model, both of which were superior to the random forest (RF) and M5 prime model tree (M5P) models, followed by the Hargreaves and Thornthwaite models. The RMSE values of Kmeans-FFA-KELM models with more than 20 subsets were decreased by 0.7-3.5% compared with those of the FFA-KELM models. The Kmeans-FFA-KELM model with 25 subsets (FFA-KELM-25) outperformed the FFA-KELM model in summer and in the count of absolute errors greater than 0.9 mm d(-1). The computational time of Kmeans-FFAKELM models first decreased and then increased with the increase of the subset number. The parallel FFA-KELM25 model (0.5-0.7 s) significantly reduced the computational time, which was 10-13 times faster than the sequential Kmeans-FFA-KELM model (7.0-7.4 s), and 1185-1603 times faster than the FFA-KELM model (802.2-830.0 s). This study provides a new and fast modeling method for processing large datasets in agricultural and water resources studies on a regional scale.

J	McKenna, JE; Johnson, JH				McKenna, James E., Jr.; Johnson, James H.			Spatial and temporal variation in distribution of larval lake whitefish in eastern Lake Ontario: Signs of recovery?	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) is one of the native Lake Ontario fishes that declined severely over the past century. Recent evidence of larval lake whitefish production in a historic spawning area (Chaumont Bay) might signal a recovery of this species in New York waters. We surveyed coastal and open water areas to evaluate densities and estimate total abundance of larval lake whitefish in Chaumont Bay. Other historic spawning areas and embayments with appropriate spawning and nursery habitat were also surveyed, but only a few larvae were found outside of Chaumont Bay. Lake whitefish larvae were found in every embayment sampled within Chaumont Bay, with larval densities of nearly 600/1000 m(2) in some samples. Greatest abundances occurred in the northern sectors and near the mouth of the bay. open water densities were generally less than half that of nearshore sites. The total bay-wide estimate for 2005 was approximately 644,000 lake whitefish larvae, but dropped to 230,000-400,000 in 2006 and 2007, respectively. Mean larval growth rates (0.36 mm/day) did not differ by year, but were consistently higher in early May than in late April. Lake whitefish production in Chaumont Bay is encouraging for this species, but the cause and persistence of the decline after 2005 can be determined only by continued monitoring. Other possible bottlenecks of survival may exist at juvenile and adult stages and could significantly affect recruitment dynamics. This species is sensitive to normal climatic fluctuations and increased variability associated with global climatic change could make winter nursery conditions unfavorable for this species.

J	Jugnia, LB; Sime-Ngando, T; Gilbert, D				Jugnia, Louis-B.; Sime-Ngando, Telesphore; Gilbert, Daniel			Dynamics and estimates of growth and loss rates of bacterioplankton in a temperate freshwater system	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												The growth rate and losses of bacterioplankton in the epilimnion of an oligo-mesotrophic reservoir were simultaneously estimated using three different methods for each process. Bacterial production was determined by means of the tritiated thymidine incorporation method, the dialysis bag method and the dilution method, while bacterial mortality was assessed with the dilution method, the disappearance of thymidine-labeled natural cells and ingestion of fluorescent bacterial tracers by heterotrophic flagellates. The different methods used to estimate bacterial growth rates yielded similar results. On the other hand, the mortality rates obtained with the dilution method were significantly lower than those obtained with the use of thymidine-labeled natural cells. The bacterial ingestion rate by flagellates accounted on average for 39% of total bacterial mortality estimated by the dilution method, but this value fell to 5% when the total mortality was measured by the thymidine-labeling method. Bacterial abundance and production varied in opposite phase to flagellate abundance and the various bacterial mortality rates. All this points to the critical importance of methodological aspects in the elaboration of quantitative models of matter and energy flows over the time through microbial trophic networks in aquatic systems, and highlights the role of bacterioplankton as a source of carbon for higher trophic levels in the studied system.					; GILBERT, Daniel/A-4137-2009; Sime-Ngando, Télesphore/M-4134-2019	Sime-Ngando, Telesphore/0000-0002-7240-5803; GILBERT, Daniel/0000-0001-9956-345X; 													0168-6496	1574-6941				OCT	2006	58	1					23	32		10.1111/j.1574-6941.2006.00145.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6941.2006.00145.x								16958905					WOS:000240367500003

Hydrostratigraphic units of the watershed, the Old Ausable River Channel (OARC) watershed, consisted of a basal unit of grey clayey-silt till, overlain in succession by three layers of sediments - lacustrine sand, shoreface sediments of sand and gravel, and aeolian dune sand. The thickness of aquifer sediments ranged from 1 m to about 25 m. The total area of the watershed is only a few hundred hectares that contribute water to the OARC through baseflow. The dam has essentially separated the channel into two distinct ecological units (north and south). To its north Chara vulgaris was the dominant species because of very low turbidity and elevated calcium and magnesium carbonates and bicarbonates in channel water. Other major associates in the community were Myriophyllum verticillatum, Wolffia spp. and Lemna minor. To the south of the dam two other aquatic plant communities, M spicatum - Elodea canadensis and Vallisneria americana - Potamogeton pulcher, dominanted primarily because of higher turbidity and backflow of nutrient rich water from an adjoining river channel in the spring. The OARC is displaying many symptoms of eutrophication, and some of the plant species that indicate high nutrient content have already started to invade the northern parts of the channel.

J	Trebitz, AS; Brazner, JC; Tanner, DK; Meyer, R				Trebitz, Anett S.; Brazner, John C.; Tanner, Danny K.; Meyer, Roger			Interacting watershed size and landcover influences on habitat and biota of Lake Superior coastal wetlands	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Coastal wetlands are important contributors to large-lake productivity and biodiversity and mediators of lake - watershed interactions. This study explores whether the size of the watershed in which coastal wetlands are embedded (a measure of strength of connection to the terrestrial landscape) influences their background condition and response to anthropogenic landuse. Water quality, substrate, vegetation structure, and composition of zoobenthos, turtles, crayfish, and fish were characterized in 32 Lake Superior coastal wetlands in the summers of 2000-2001, and related to watershed size categories via ANOVA and to watershed development (percent agricultural and urban landuse) via linear regression. Lake Superior coastal wetlands had relatively low levels of watershed development - apparently not enough to significantly alter fish composition. However, watershed development was associated with significant changes in substrate, turbidity, plant structure, and zoobenthos, and in most cases these effects were stronger in wetlands having big rather than small watersheds. An alternate classification contrasting exposure to versus protection from river influences was not effective at resolving responses to watershed development. Watershed size had little effect on background conditions in minimally disturbed wetlands, although turtles were more abundant in large-watershed wetlands. The role of watershed size in mediating responses to landuse merits further study, but our findings suggest that receiving inflows from bigger watersheds affects coastal wetlands primarily by amplifying transmission of disturbance rather than via direct impacts of flow.																			1463-4988	1539-4077					2011	14	4					443	455		10.1080/14634988.2011.635901	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14634988.2011.635901													WOS:000298355900013

We review quantitative and semi-quantitative approaches for reconstructing climatic variables in the Austrian and Swiss sector of the Alpine region within this time interval. Available quantitative to semi-quantitative climate records in this region are mainly based on fossil assemblages of biota such as chironomids, cladocerans, co-leopterans, diatoms and pollen preserved in lake sediments and peat, the analysis of oxygen isotopes in speleothems and lake sediment records, the reconstruction of past variations in treeline altitude, the reconstruction of past equilibrium line altitude and extent of glaciers based on geomorphological evidence, and the interpretation of past soil formation processes, dust deposition and permafrost as apparent in loess-palaeosol sequences. Palaeoclimate reconstructions in the Alpine region are affected by dating uncertainties increasing with age, the fragmentary nature of most of the available records, which typically only incorporate a fraction of the time interval of interest, and the limited replication of records within and between regions. Furthermore, there have been few attempts to cross-validate different approaches across this time interval to confirm reconstructed patterns of climatic change by several independent lines of evidence. Based on our review we identify a number of developments that would provide major advances for palaeoclimate reconstruction for the period 60-8 ka in the Alps and their forelands. These include (1) the compilation of individual, fragmentary records to longer and continuous reconstructions, (2) replication of climate records and the development of regional reconstructions for different parts of the Alps, (3) the cross-validation of different proxy-types and approaches, and (4) the reconstruction of past variations in climate gradients across the Alps and their forelands. Furthermore, the development of downscaled climate model runs for the Alpine region 60-8 ka, and of forward modelling approaches for climate proxies would expand the opportunities for quantitative assessments of climatic conditions in Europe within this time-interval.

Var. formosana (Hayata) Rehder	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY												Chamaecyparis obtusa Sieb. and Zucc. var. formosana (Hayata) Rehder is the dominant species in the temperate forest of Yuanyang Lake Nature Reserve (YYL), Taiwan. Although downed logs of C. obstusa var. formosana occupy only a small percentage of the forest floor area in YYL, they are important regeneration substrates. Seedlings of this species often grow without competition on the new downed logs, and a few broadleaf trees grow with them. We hypothesized that the bark of the newly fallen logs possesses allelopathic potential that provides a habitat especially suitable for seedling establishment. Eight different seeds including those from Lactuca sativa L. (lettuce), Bidens pilosa (an invasive weed), and six species in YYL were planted on the bark of the downed logs in an incubator for germination tests. Two dominant species in the forest of YYL, C. obtusa var. formosana and Rhododendron formosanum, were able to grow normally, but the others, Pieris taiwanensis, Barthea formosana, Chamaecyparis formosensis, Miscanthus transmorrisonensis, lettuce, and B. pilosa were growth inhibited. A bioactivity-guided isolation was designed to isolate allelochemicals from the bark. Salicylic acid, one of the inhibiting substances, was isolated and identified by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS), proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR), and infrared (IR). Bioassay of salicylic acid confirmed a phytotoxic effect. The results suggest that the dominance of C. obtusa var. formosana seedlings on bark could be partly due to allelopathy.																			0098-0331	1573-1561				JUN	2007	33	6					1283	1296		10.1007/s10886-007-9278-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10886-007-9278-1								17476467					WOS:000247155800016
J	APPLETON, CC; BRUTON, MN				APPLETON, CC; BRUTON, MN			EPIDEMIOLOGY OF SCHISTOSOMIASIS IN THE VICINITY OF LAKE SIBAYA, WITH A NOTE ON OTHER AREAS OF TONGALAND (NATAL, SOUTH-AFRICA)	ANNALS OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND PARASITOLOGY												The epidemiology of human and bovine schistosomiasis in the Lake Sibaya area of Tongaland, South Africa, an undeveloped rural environment, is discussed. The mean prevalence of Schistosoma haematobium infection is 72%, but S. mansoni is absent; possible reasons for this are given and the different types of water habitat are shown to play different roles in transmission. Fear of crocodiles and hippopotami is important because villagers are compelled to use for domestic purposes, the smaller, shallower habitats, where Bulinus globosus occurs but not Biomphalaria pfeifferi, rather than the deeper, larger ones where both snails are found. This discontinuous distribution of B. pfeifferi in the deeper sites, due to the high temperatures in spring, is viewed in relation to local climatic conditions. A human population influx, such as would result from the economic development of Tongaland, would cause not only a decline in crocodile and hippopotamus populations, and thus encourage human contact with the deeper waterbodies, but would favor the introduction of S. mansoni into at least some of these habitats. A similar prevalence pattern of human schistosomiasis exists over the remainder of Tongaland and the lowlands of southern and central Mozambique. The mean prevalence of S. mattheei in Tongaland cattle is 42% and although data are not available a comparable percentage seems likely in Mozambique.																			0003-4983	1364-8594					1979	73	6					547	561		10.1080/00034983.1979.11687297	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00034983.1979.11687297								539856					WOS:A1979HY30500004
J	Kostic, S; Parker, G				Kostic, Svetlana; Parker, Gary			Conditions under which a supercritical turbidity current traverses an abrupt transition to vanishing bed slope without a hydraulic jump	JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS												Turbidity currents act to sculpt the submarine environment through sediment erosion and deposition. A sufficiently swift turbidity current on a steep slope can be expected to be supercritical in the sense of the bulk Richardson number; a sufficiently tranquil turbidity current on a mild slope can be expected to be subcritical. The transition from supercritical to subcritical flow is accomplished through an internal hydraulic jump. Consider a steady turbidity current flowing from a steep canyon onto a milder fan, and then exiting the fan down another steep canyon. The flow might be expected to undergo a hydraulic Jump to subcritical flow near the canyon-fan break, and then accelerate again to critical flow at the fan-canyon break downstream. The problem of locating the hydraulic jump is here termed the 'jump problem'. Experiments with fine-grained sediment have confirmed the expected behaviour outlined above. Similar experiments with coarse-grained sediment suggest that if the deposition rate is sufficiently high, this 'jump problem' may have no solution with the expected behaviour, and in particular no solution with a hydraulic jump. In such cases, the flow either transits the length of the low-slope fan as a supercritical flow and shoots off the fan-canyon break without responding to it, or dissipates as a supercritical flow before exiting the fan. The analysis presented below confirms the existence of a range associated with rapid sediment deposition where no solution to the 'jump problem' can be found. The criterion for this range is stated in terms of an order-one dimensionless parameter involving the fall velocity of the sediment. The criterion is tested and confirmed against the experiments mentioned above. A sample field application is presented.																			0022-1120	1469-7645				SEP 10	2007	586						119	145		10.1017/S0022112007006738	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022112007006738													WOS:000249409500006
J	Nehza, O; Woo, KS				Nehza, O.; Woo, K. S.			The effect of subaerial exposure on the morphology and microstructure of stromatolites in the Cretaceous Sinyangdong Formation, Gyeongsang Supergroup, Korea	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Stromatolite morphology is usually controlled by a number of biological and environmental factors. In the south-eastern part of the Korean Peninsula, three stromatolite units of the Cretaceous Sinyangdong Formation have been studied with regard to the effect of diagenesis on their morphology. Here, it is proposed that subaerial exposure and meteoric diagenesis are the most significant factors in shaping the stromatolites of the Cretaceous Sinyangdong Formation. Most previous palaeontological and sedimentological studies on stromatolites have concentrated on the environmental and biogenic controls on stromatolite morphology. These include extrinsic factors such as sedimentation rates or current velocities. The main controlling factor on the morphology of the stromatolites in the Sinyangdong Formation is apparently transient subaerial exposure and related meteoric diagenesis. Textural examination of stromatolite samples from three stratigraphic horizons shows a characteristic repetitive pattern of cycles with gradual transition from fibrous calcite to micrite layers, reflecting changes in the hydrological cycle of the lake in which the stromatolites grew. Stromatolite growth was terminated by corroded surfaces indicative of subaerial exposure related to a fall in lake level. The growth pattern of the stromatolites was mostly determined by the morphology of the corroded substrates during subaerial exposure. Furthermore, the internal stromatolite structure was strongly modified by the process of leaching. As a result, growth forms mostly changed from stratiform to columnar mesostructure. This study strongly implies that diagenesis could make a very significant influence on the morphogenesis of lacustrine stromatolites in the geological past.																			0037-0746	1365-3091				OCT	2006	53	5					1121	1133		10.1111/j.1365-3091.2006.00804.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3091.2006.00804.x													WOS:000240633400008

Lake water collected from the hypolimnion, with phosphate (PO4-P) concentrations of 0.25 to 0.49 mg/L, was passed through a pilot-scale (pore volume, similar to 0.87 m(3)) treatment system over two successive summers. In year 1, the hydraulic retention time (HRT) varied from 0.58 to 1.64 days and 96.1-98.1% PO4-P was removed. The HRT in year 2 was 0.31 to 0.48 days and PO4-P removal was 97.4-99.9%. Effluent pH was 11.37 +/- 0.17 and 11.96 +/- 0.17 in years 1 and 2, respectively, with the increase attributed to dissolution of CaO and Ca(OH)(2) from the BOFS. The effluent was neutralized by addition of CO2(g) before the water was discharged. Vanadium and aluminum were released from the BOFS, and were subsequently removed through addition of a filter containing 5 wt.% granular zero valent iron with a balance of silica sand and by neutralizing pH. Solid phase analyses conducted on the spent media, including FESEM-EDX, XPS, FTIR, and XANES spectroscopy, confirmed the presence of calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate minerals. Diminished hydraulic performance was observed in year 1, which was attributed to CaCO3 accumulation on the spent BOFS media. Restricting ingress of atmospheric CO2 into the system in year 2 minimized the extent of CaCO3 accumulation on the treatment media and led to improved hydraulic characteristics. Results show potential for long-term removal of phosphorus.																			1092-8758	1557-9018				NOV 1	2014	31	11					631	642		10.1089/ees.2014.0074	http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/ees.2014.0074													WOS:000343898200006

FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Wood is a key structural element in aquatic ecosystems. Wood provides habitat complexity, alters geomorphology, retains organic and inorganic material, promotes hyporheic flow, and acts as substrate for biofilms and invertebrates. Fire is an important disturbance promoting wood recruitment into inland waters, but most studies have focused on streams in western North America. Less is known about fire-derived wood dynamics on other continents or in lake environments. Here, we review fire effects on the recruitment, distribution, and function of in-stream wood, with emphasis on a series of studies from the Euro-Mediterranean. The amount of large wood in these streams was low and is expected to decline in the future because of wildfire. Wildfire engendered inputs of wood with low structural complexity, probably reducing habitat heterogeneity for aquatic organisms. Fire also provided wood with greater diameter than wood recruited by other means, but its longevity may be shorter because burned wood was more decayed and less anchored in the channel than unburned wood. Wood delivery processes are important because macroinvertebrate colonization differed between fire-derived wood that fell directly into the river and wood conditioned first on the forest floor. We present a case study describing wood dynamics in a lake after a wildfire in northern Minnesota, USA. In this study, wildfire created an area of lake shoreline with disproportionately more wood than areas unaffected by wildfire. In contrast to streams, burned wood was more complex than unburned wood in the lake system. One of the explanations may be greater scouring, abrasive action by stream flows, which breaks down burned wood faster than in lakes. Given the expected increase in the probability and severity of fire around the world, information in our review can be used to help manage riparian zones of streams and lakes.					; Warren, Dana/G-5600-2012; Vaz, Pedro/C-6718-2008; Rego, Francisco/H-9155-2013; Castro Rego, Francisco/H-9155-2013	Warren, Dana/0000-0001-5282-7972; Vaz, Pedro/0000-0002-2321-1287; Castro Rego, Francisco/0000-0003-0060-5192													2161-9549	2161-9565				DEC	2015	34	4					1468	1481		10.1086/684095	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/684095													WOS:000364815000022
J	DONALD, DB; SYRGIANNIS, J				DONALD, DB; SYRGIANNIS, J			OCCURRENCE OF PESTICIDES IN PRAIRIE LAKES IN SASKATCHEWAN IN RELATION TO DROUGHT AND SALINITY	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Prairie lakes are critical breeding, staging, and feeding habitat for a variety of shorebirds and waterfowl, and lower trophic levels in these habitats could be affected by agricultural pesticides. Following the severe drought of 1988 in Saskatchewan, concentration of 11 pesticides were determined in water, sediment, and zooplankton in 10 permanent and nine semipermanent lakes (those lakes that did not have standing water in 1988). The detection frequency for lindane, alpha-HCH, and 2,4-D in water was 57, 70, and 78%, respectively, with the maximum concentration 0.011, 0.004, and 0.43 mu g/L, respectively. Triallate was detected in 39% of sediment samples and 54% of zooplankton samples at a maximum concentration of 31 and 10.2 mu g/ kg, respectively. When the lakes were grouped by salinity, detection frequencies of these pesticides were significantly higher in brackish lakes, which tended to be semipermanent (N = 6, mean specific conductance 3100 mu S/cm) than in saline lakes, which tended to be permanent (N = 6, mean specific conductance 60 900 mu S/cm). Other pesticides were detected in <20% of samples (diclofop-methyl, atrazine, MPCA, dicamba, and bromoxynil) or not at all (trifuralin and picloram). With one exception, pesticide concentrations in these lakes were below those levels that might be deleterious to aquatic Life, suggesting that these pesticides have not affected the food of avifauna at these lakes.																			0047-2425					MAR-APR	1995	24	2					266	270		10.2134/jeq1995.00472425002400020008x	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq1995.00472425002400020008x													WOS:A1995QN67700007

Long-term stability of the genome structure of the cyanobacterium, Dolichospermum in a deep German lake	HARMFUL ALGAE												Dolichospermum is a cyanobacterial genus commonly associated with toxic blooms in lakes and brackish water bodies worldwide, and is a long-term resident of Lake Stechlin, northeastern Germany. In recent decades, shifts in the phosphorus loading and phytoplankton species composition have seen increased biomass of Dolichospermum during summer blooms from 1998, peaking around 2005, and declining after 2020. Cyanobacteria are known to rapidly adapt to new environments, facilitated by genome adaptation. To investigate the changes in genomic features that may have occurred in Lake Stechlin Dolichospermum during this time of increased phosphorus loading and higher biomass, whole genome sequence analysis was performed on samples of ten akinetes isolated from ten, 1 cm segments of a sediment core, representing a similar to 45-year period from 1970 to 2017. Comparison of these genomes with genomes of extant isolates revealed a clade of Dolichospermum that clustered with the ADA-6 genus complex, with remarkable genome stability, without gene gain or loss events in response to recent environmental changes. The genome characteristics indicate that this species is suited to a deepchlorophyll maximum, including additional light-harvesting and phosphorus scavenging genes. Population SNP analysis revealed two sub-populations that shifted in dominance as the lake transitioned between oligotrophic and eutrophic conditions. Overall, the results show little change within the population, despite diversity between extant populations from different geographic locations and the in-lake changes in phosphorus concentrations.

J	Bu, MS; Li, YP; Wei, J; Tang, CY				Bu, Minsheng; Li, Yiping; Wei, Jin; Tang, Chunyan			The Influence of Ship Waves on Sediment Resuspension in the Large Shallow Lake Taihu, China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH												Sediment resuspension induces endogenous nutrient release in shallow lakes, which has been demonstrated to be associated with eutrophication. In addition to natural wind-driven resuspension, navigable shallow lakes (such as Lake Taihu, China) also experience resuspension from human activities, such as ship waves. Both processes determine the intensity, frequency, and duration of sediment resuspension, and may consequently affect the pattern of cyanobacteria blooms in the lake. In this study, acoustic Doppler Velocimeter (ADV), Optical Backscatter Sensor (OBS), and temperature wave tide gauge (instrument model :RBR duo TD|wave) were placed in an observation platform in the lake to obtain high-frequency flow velocities, suspended sediment concentration (SSC), and wave parameters before, during, and after a cargo ship passed by. We found that the ship wave disturbance intensity is greatly influenced by the draft depth. The movement generated by ship disturbance is primarily horizontal rather than vertical. Compared with the wind-induced wave, the disturbance caused by the ship waves has a high intensity, short duration, and narrow range of influence. The maximum total shear stress under ship disturbance can reach 9 similar to 90 times the critical shear stress under a natural state. Therefore, the effect of ship waves on sediment resuspension near the channel of Lake Taihu is much greater than that of wind-induced waves. These findings represent an important step towards understanding the quantitative relationship between ship wave disturbance and sediment resuspension, and lay the foundation for future research in order to understand and control the eutrophication of shallow lakes.

Spawning areas, dispersion and microhabitats of fish larvae in the Anavilhanas Ecological Station, rio Negro, Amazonas State, Brazil	NEOTROPICAL ICHTHYOLOGY												The abundance and distribution of ichthyoplankton and their relationships to current velocity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH and electrical conductivity of the water in the Anavilhanas Ecological Station, Negro River, Amazonas State, Brazil, were analyzed. Preferred microhabitats for spawning, dispersion and nursery were also verified. Sampling was undertaken during the falling water period of 2001 and the rising water period of 2002, in a section of 100 km subdivided into 5 subsections, with a total of 20 stations (5 beaches, 5 ravines, 5 channels, and 5 lake channels) at night and during the day at the surface and at the bottom. 647 eggs and 4,187 larvae were captured, belonging to 10 families and four orders: Characiformes (6), Siluriformes (2), Perciformes (1), and Clupeiformes (1). Engraulidae (55.39%), Pimelodidae (30.45%), Auchenipteridae (5.23%) and Sciaenidae (5.13%) were the dominant families. The hierarchical statistical model (ANOVA) with three factors (microhabitat, depth and period) was applied to the environmental variables and the larval abundance, showing greater abundances of sciaenids in the ravines and lower abundances of engraulids in the channels. The highest captures were obtained at lower temperature values, at the bottom during the day and at the surface at night, suggesting an active larval behavior. The presence of the four larval development stages in all subsection for pimelodids and sciaenids, and in three subsections for engraulids, indicates that the Anavilhanas Ecological Station is an important spawning and nursery area for species of these groups in the Negro River. Larvae abundance of all characiform families was extremely low (from 0.1 to 1.17%), suggesting that they do not spawn in this system.

Marine protected areas in the northern part of the Bulgarian Black sea shelf	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY												The Bulgarian marine reserve was proposed to be 'mirror-like'to the Romanian protected area. The main anticipated zone should be situated from the Bulgarian-Romanian border (cape Siviburum, cape Kartalburum) to the southern part of the Durankulak lake. We suggest also establishment of two additional zones for marine reserve: first one is situated at the shallow waters in front of the Krapets village and Shabla. In those peculiar habitat was found mass occurrence of Turbot (Psetta maxima L., 1758) for spawning in spring (April-June). Moreover, this species suffered overexploitation of the stock during the long period, and recently the marine fishing legislation advice restrictions on the small size catches. In this point of view, determination of this protected area will contribute to the population conservation and will facilitate the implementation of legislation recommendations. The second additional proposed area is situated from Tiulenovo to Kamen briag, where previously (until 60's) were observed couples of the seal monk (Monachus monachus). This species was included in the Red Book of the Black sea endangered species in 70's. The seal monk belongs to the group of top-predators, which distinction together with reduction of the dolphins abundance was the main reason for the trophic cascades in 80's, with deleterious effects on the whole ecosystem. The establishment of the protected areas will couple together strong ecological effects (biodiversity conservation and restoration of the endangered species) and socioeconomic effects (restriction of the poaching and bottom trawling and drag-net fishing).

J	Kataoka, K				Kataoka, K			Distal fluvio-lacustrine volcaniclastic resedimentation in response to an explosive silicic eruption: The Pliocene Mushono tephra bed, central Japan	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												The Pliocene Mushono tephra bed, central Japan, is characterized by fluvio-lacustrine volcaniclastic resedimentation at distal locations from the volcanic source. Sedimentary responses to an explosive eruption are well recorded in the resedimented Mushono tephra bed. Immediately after the eruption, large volumes of primary volcaniclastic material were reworked from proximal areas and discharged into the distal basin. Overloading of fluvial systems by pyroclastic debris resulted in the development of low-sinuosity active fluvial channel systems that carried sediment-laden, hyperconcentrated flows. The fluvial system flowed into a lake more than 150 km from the inferred source location, resulting in delta formation and progradation. Primary pyroclastic fall deposits are only a few centimeters thick but are overlain by reworked volcaniclastic deposits more than 5 m thick, which show coarsening-upward successions representing fluvio-lacustrine deltaic progradation. The reworked succession consists of six sedimentary facies, which can be interpreted as prodelta, mouth bar, distributary-channel, hyperconcentrated-flow, interdistributary-lowland or floodplain, and slump deposits. Rounded, cobble-sized pumice clasts in prodelta and distributary-channel deposits and thick, reworked deposits imply that the majority of resedimented volcaniclastic material was derived from voluminous proximal ignimbrite, rather than thin, fine-grained distal fallout ash material. Vertical facies changes are concordant with a decrease in sediment yields with time. Lateral facies distributions correspond to episodic influxes of volcaniclastic sediments that controlled the morphology of discrete fluvio-lacustrine deltas. The distal sedimentary response to an explosive silicic eruption is thus clearly recorded in vertical and lateral facies distribution of reworked volcaniclastic sediments.

Lacustrine, fine-grained ( < 0.1 mm), volcaniclastic rocks from the Lower Cretaceous Bayindulan Sag in the Erlian Basin, China, contain diagenetic minerals produced from reactions between volcanic materials (volcaniclastics and ash fall) and diagenetic fluids derived from a saline alkaline lake. Mineral products include: high concentrations of diagenetic ankerite, dolomite, ferroan calcite, analcime with high ratio of Si to Al, Wyoming montmorillonite, illite-smectite mixed layer, and amorphous Si-rich material. These rocks can be divided into two types based on the occurrence and composition of authigenic carbonate minerals: non-carbonatized volcaniclastic rocks (Non-Carb-VR) and carbonatized volcaniclastic rocks (Carb-VR). Iron, magnesium, calcium, and sodium are probably derived from alteration of intermediate and calc-alkaline volcanic materials and from illitization of Wyoming montmorillonite. Petrographic textures indicate that ferroan calcite and non-ferroan dolomite predated ankerite (78-103 degrees C). Geochemistry analysis (TiO2 versus Al2O3, Zr/TiO2 versus Nb/Y, and Zr versus Nb) indicates that the precursor rocks were dacitic or rhyodacitic in composition. The compositions of heavy C (0.2 parts per thousand-8.4 parts per thousand, V-PDB) and light O ( -17.5 parts per thousand to - 7.0 parts per thousand, V-PDB) isotopes are probably influenced by methanogenic fermentation. The process of burial dolomitization can be divided into two stages: (1) mixed sedimentation and bacterial methanogenesis; and (2) alteration of volcanic materials and transformation of clay minerals. This study documents a new process for dolomite formation through the alteration of volcanic materials.

J	Mason, PRD; Kaspers, K; van Bergen, MJ				Mason, PRD; Kaspers, K; van Bergen, MJ			Determination of sulfur isotope ratios and concentrations in water samples using ICP-MS incorporating hexapole ion optics	JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL ATOMIC SPECTROMETRY												Sulfur isotope ratios are difficult to determine by quadrupole ICP-MS due to interfering O-2(+) and NO+ molecular ions of high signal intensity at isotopes S-32 and S-34. Rf-only hexapole devices have recently been introduced into ICP-MS instrumentation to facilitate ion transfer from interface to analyser. By introducing a mixture of 'reactive' gases into the hexapole, a series of ion-molecule reactions can be induced to reduce or remove interfering polyatomic species. The effects of various gas mixtures (He, H-2 and Xe) on the transfer of sulfur ions through the hexapole and the breakdown of interfering O-2(+) and NO+ molecular ions at m/z = 32 and m/z = 34 were investigated. A rapid charge transfer reaction between O-2(+) and Xe gives at least a factor of 10 improvement in the S+ /O-2(+) ratio. A further reduction in O-2(+) is achieved by the addition of H-2.delta(34)S variations were investigated in crater-lake waters and waters obtained from springs and rivers on the flanks of volcanoes in Java, Indonesia. Under optimum conditions (S = 10-50 mg l(-1)), the S-34/S-32 measurement precision for standards and samples was <0.3% RSD. Mass bias errors were corrected by using a concentration-matched in-house standard of average North Atlantic sea-water (delta(34)S = 20.5 parts per thousand). Results compare favorably against published data measured by standard gas source mass spectrometric techniques. The proposed technique is potentially useful as a survey tool due to the large delta(34)S variation (+/-20 parts per thousand) encountered in nature and the accuracy and reproducibility of the technique (+/-3-5 parts per thousand).

We found that external inputs in the early 2020s contained only 10% of phosphorus (P) compared to the mid-1980s, mainly due to effective purification of urban wastewater. Although in-lake P and chlorophyll concentrations decreased four-fivefold, summer Secchi depths are only 40-60 cm, but not because large sediment nutrient pools causes high internal loading and long-term delays upon load reductions. Rather, frequent sediment resuspension ensures intimate contact between nutrient pools in surface sediments and the water and close correspondence between P inputs and in-lake concentrations. Thus, costly attempts to remove surface sediments or add chemicals to bind P will not have long-term effects. Instead, predictions show that reducing the external P input twofold would increase Secchi depths to about 1 m and might bring waterplants back to Lake Arres & oslash;. For this to happen would require appreciable reduction in nutrient runoffs from the farmland by means of larger uncultivated lowland areas, wider buffer strips along the streams and reduced fertilizer application.

Twenty-Year Review of Outdoor Air Quality in Utah, USA	ATMOSPHERE												Air quality is a prevalent concern due to its imposing health risks. The state of Utah, USA, at times over the last 20 years has suffered from some of the worst air quality in the nation. The propensity for the state of Utah to experience elevated concentrations of particulate matter and ozone can in part be attributed to its unique geography that features dry, mountainous topography. Valleys in Utah create ideal environments for extended cold-pool events. In this review, we summarize the research executed in Utah over the past 20 years (2002-2022) by dividing the state into six regions: Utah Valley, Summit County, Southern Utah (regions south of Utah Valley), Cache Valley, Uinta Basin, and Salt Lake Valley. We review the published literature chronologically and provide a summary of each region identifying areas where additional research is warranted. We found that the research effort is weighted towards Uinta Basin and Salt Lake Valley, with the other regions in Utah only adding up to 20% of the research effort. We identified a need for more source apportionment studies, speciated volatile organic compound (VOC) studies, and ozone isopleths. Where ozone isopleths are not able to be created, measurement of glyoxal and formaldehyde concentrations could serve as surrogates for more expensive studies to inform ozone mitigation policies.					; Flowerday, Callum/GQP-2941-2022	Hansen, Jaron/0000-0003-2894-7987; Flowerday, Callum/0000-0003-4172-3910														2073-4433				OCT	2023	14	10							1496	10.3390/atmos14101496	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos14101496													WOS:001095715400001

Mapping key agricultural sources of dust emissions within the Lake Simcoe airshed	INLAND WATERS												A decline in water quality attributed to excessive inputs of phosphorus has been observed in Lake Simcoe over the past few decades. Various studies have estimated that 25-50% of the total phosphorus entering the lake is from atmospheric deposition. Bare soil exposure in the spring due to lack of vegetative cover, along with soil disturbance related to agricultural activities, results in higher susceptibility to wind erosion and dust emission. This study introduces the new concept of Dust Response Units (DRUs), which combine soil type and land use to determine the dust emission susceptibility based on the hourly variation of wind speed and monthly changes in soil cover due to crop growth. The Wind Erosion Prediction System (WEPS) was used to determine dust emission suppression factors for a combination of 11 different soils and 6 dominant agricultural land uses, totaling 66 different DRUs in the Lake Simcoe airshed. Employing a widely used dust emission model and applying these dust emission suppression factors resulted in the identification of high risk DRUs. Twelve of the potential 66 DRUs were determined to contribute 85% of the total crop dust emissions within the Lake Simcoe airshed, including sand, loam, sandy loam, and loamy sand soils combined with row crop, mixed, and hay and pasture land management operations. This study demonstrates a new method to map high priority areas for targeted implementation of dust control best management practices that could be useful in agricultural areas both within and beyond the Lake Simcoe airshed.

J	Xiong, WH; Peng, JA				Xiong, Wenhui; Peng, Jian			Laboratory-Scale Investigation of Ferrihydrite-Modified Diatomite as a Phosphorus Co-precipitant	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												The potential of ferrihydrite-modified diatomite as a phosphorus co-precipitant was investigated at a laboratory scale. Ferrihydrite-modified diatomite was demonstrated to effectively remove phosphorus from lake water as well as strongly bind phosphorus in sediment under anoxic conditions. Phosphorus removal from the lake water proceeded primarily through phosphorus adsorption onto ferrihydrite-modified diatomite and further phosphorus consumption by stimulated diatom growth. A total phosphorus removal efficiency of 85% was achieved when lake water was dosed with 250 mg/L ferrihydrite-modified diatomite; the residual total phosphorus concentration was 17.0 A mu g/L, which falls within the range for oligotrophic phosphorus levels. During a 30-day anoxic incubation period, total phosphorus concentrations in lake water treated with 400, 500, or 600 mg/L of ferrihydrite-modified diatomite slightly decreased and maximum total phosphorus concentrations remained below 15 A mu g/L. Addition of ferrihydrite-modified diatomite resulted in a marked increase in the iron-bound phosphorus fraction, a pronounced decrease in labile phosphorus and organic-bound phosphorus fractions, and stable aluminum-bound phosphorus, calcium-bound phosphorus, and residual phosphorus fractions in the anoxic sediments. Comparable iron-bound phosphorus concentration in the sediment treated by 400 mg/L of ferrihydrite-modified diatomite relative to that of the sediment treated by the combination of 400 mg/L of ferrihydrite-modified diatomite and alum solution at the concentration less than 532 mg/L indicated that ferrihydrite-modified diatomite exhibited a stable phosphorus-binding capacity when dosed at a similar amount. Ferrihydrite-modified diatomite had the potential to be used as an effective phosphorus co-precipitant.																			0049-6979	1573-2932				FEB	2011	215	1-4					645	654		10.1007/s11270-010-0506-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-010-0506-x													WOS:000286195800052

'Cabernet Franc' on its own roots had a lower cumulative yield and cluster number than on any other rootstock. Own rooted 'Riesling' also had low yields along with 'Riesling' on 101-14 Mgt., 1616E and 5BB. There was an interaction with yield and cluster number due to the much higher yields on 1616E and 5BB with 'Cabernet Franc' compared to 'Riesling'. 'Riesling' on 3309C, 5C, SO4 18-815C and 5BB had-three times the cumulative pruning weight than own rooted vines. 'Cabernet Franc' on SO4 had very low cumulative pruning weights. No interaction between rootstock ana cultivar occurred for cluster and fruit quality data. Own rooted vines had small clusters with smaller and fewer berries. Vines on SO4, 5C and 18-815C tended to produce large clusters with more berries. Soluble solids in berries from 101-14 were higher than from berries on 1616E and 5BB. Over five years, juice pH from fruit on 3309C, 5C and SO4 was higher than juice from 1616E. Root-stock had no effect on total acidity. 'Cabernet Franc' had higher pruning weights and yields than 'Riesling', but did not survive the low winter temperatures as well and had more crown gall.																			0091-3642					APR	1996	50	2					124	130																WOS:A1996UJ02100010

Shifts in dragonfly community structure across aquatic ecotones	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ODONATOLOGY												Dragonflies (Odonata: Anisoptera) are often used as indicators of habitat type and quality due to their varied use of aquatic and terrestrial habitats. Species differ in their preferences for lotic and lentic waters, but community changes across ecotones, or transitional zones between distinct habitats (e.g. lotic and lentic), are not well understood. We quantified dragonfly species richness, abundance, and composition along a gradient of habitat types, including streams, stream mouths (ecotones), and open waters (lakes and ponds). We tested if dragonfly assemblages in aquatic ecotones differ from adjacent stream and open water habitats, and how species respond to riparian forest cover across these habitat types. Adult dragonflies were sampled in all habitat types at four sites in southwest Ohio during the summer of 2016. Riparian canopy cover and relative densities of algal mats and emergent vegetation were recorded. We sampled 157 individuals of 12 dragonfly species and found significant differences in community composition between stream and ecotone habitats, both forming subsets of the open water community. Canopy cover explained 55% and 75% of abundance and species richness variance across habitat types, respectively, but these relationships were strongest at ecotones. Finally, the Odonata Index of Wetland Integrity (OIWI), which uses sensitivities of adult odonates to habitat disturbances to evaluate wetland conditions, showed that species composition at ecotones uniquely represents the ecological integrity of the entire wetland system. Thus, transition zones may provide an effective and more efficient alternative to rapidly assess wetland quality for conservation monitoring than sampling the entire wetland.

J	VINCENT, WF				VINCENT, WF			AUTECOLOGY OF AN ULTRA-PLANKTONIC SHADE ALGA IN LAKE TAHOE	JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												The ultraplanktonic green alga Monoraphidium contortum Korm. in Lake Tahoe (California-Nevada) demonstrated several ecological and physiological attributes of a genetically adapted shade species. M. contortum achieved maximum biomass during deep mixing in winter when light availability was at a minimum. During stratification it was found in maximum abundance in the deep euphotic region, 100-150 m. This species was also distributed through the deep aphotic zone where, despite prolonged darkness, it remained capable of immediate photosynthesis when re-exposed to light levels in the euphotic zone. The spirally twisted cells were grazed by 2 calanoid copepods in Lake Tahoe as readily as much larger-celled phytoplankton species of less complex morphology. Slow growth rates in combination with high susceptibility to copepod grazing may effectively exclude M. contortum from the upper 75 m, where it was rarely recorded. In culture it showed a marked incapacity to adjust to sun conditions but was well adapted to low light regimes. Under a wide range of irradiances, photochemical capacity, photosynthetic capacity and growth rates were low, but cellular pigment content remained high. The ratio of Pmax [maximum photosynthesis] to respiration was at the lower end of the range for shade plants. Genetically distinct sun and shade populations of phytoplankton may play a determining role in major shifts of community structure over depth and time in Lake Tahoe.					; Vincent, Warwick/AAH-6152-2019	Vincent, Warwick/0000-0001-9055-1938; 													0022-3646	1529-8817					1982	18	2					226	232																WOS:A1982PJ07400008

A perspective on needed research, modeling, and management approaches that can enhance Great Lakes fisheries management under changing ecosystem conditions	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The Great Lakes Fishery Commission sponsored a 2-day workshop that sought to enhance the ability of Great Lakes agencies to understand, predict, and ideally manage fisheries production in the face of changes in natural and anthropogenic forcings (e.g., climate, invasive species, and nutrients). The workshop brought together 18 marine and freshwater researchers with collective expertise in aquatic ecology, physical oceanography, limnology, climate modeling, and ecosystem modeling, and two individuals with fisheries management expertise. We report on the outcome of a writing exercise undertaken as part of this workshop that challenged each participant to identify three needs, which if addressed, could most improve the ability of Great Lakes agencies to manage their fisheries in the face of ecosystem change. Participant responses fell into two categories. The first identified gaps in ecological understanding, including how physical and biological processes can regulate early life growth and survival, how life-history strategies vary across species and within populations, and how anthropogenic stressors (e.g., nutrient runoff, climate change) can interact to influence fish populations. The second category pointed to the need for improved approaches to research (e.g., meta-analytic, comparative, spatial translation) and management (e.g., mechanistic management models, consideration of multi-stock management), and also identified the need for improved predictive models of the physical environment and associated ecosystem monitoring programs. While some progress has been made toward addressing these needs, we believe that a continued focus will be necessary to enable optimal fisheries management responses to forthcoming ecosystem change.

Evaluation of SAR altimetry over the antarctic ice sheet from CryoSat-2 acquisitions	ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH												Since the 1990s and the launch of ERS-1, Earth's polar regions have been near continuously monitored by satellite altimetry, improving substantially our knowledge of the ice sheet topography and its evolution. CryoSat-2 is the first satellite carrying on-board a new generation of radar altimeter able to operate in a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mode. In comparison with the Low Resolution Mode (LRM) used in conventional radar altimetry, SAR mode allows to reduce the along-track footprint from several kilometers to 300 m. In this paper we assess the SAR mode performance over the Antarctic ice sheet using sporadic CryoSat-2 acquisitions carried out in winter 2014 on dedicated zones (Lake Vostok and Adelie land). Level-1 data from two different algorithms are exploited: the CNES Cryosat-2 Processing Prototype (CPP) and the ESA Instrument Processing Facility (IPF). Firstly, results show that the estimated surface elevation from the SAR mode acquisitions over the flat surface of Lake Vostok is within the same order of magnitude as available DEMs. Mean bias is in the order of several centimeters, without any corrections accounting for the snowpack volume scattering. Secondly, the undertaken analyzes evidence that SAR altimetry has either no, or only small, sensitivity to the along-track slope-induced effect, while the across-track slope-induced effect is similar as LRM. Thirdly, SAR altimetry mode appears to be more performant than Pseudo-LRM over the steep slopes of the Antarctica margins. The precision of the estimated surface elevation is improved by 30%, and the processed waveforms are less noisy. Overall, this work demonstrates the improved measuring capability offered by SAR mode altimetry over the ice sheet surface compared to conventional altimetry. (C) 2018 COSPAR.

These areas include the area from Baton Rouge to the Gulf of Mexico, two parishes around Lake Charles in Louisiana, the Houston-Galveston-Beaumont-Port Arthur area, and Victoria County in Texas. In meeting this overall objective, several supporting objectives must be met, including (1) identification of representative ozone episodes; (2) development of appropriate emissions inventories for the episodes (including OCS and onshore emissions, and growth/control in calendar years of interest); (3) collection of appropriate meteorological and air quality data in the summer of 1993; (4) photochemical model application and data analyses to assess the effects of alternative OCS development in the Gulf Coast area on the onshore ozone nonattainment areas; (5) characterization of the uncertainty in the model estimations; and (6) evaluation of the needs for future research and/or data collection efforts to improve understanding of the OCS effects on ambient ozone on shore. This paper describes the Gulf of Mexico Air Quality Study (GMAQS) photochemical modeling and monitoring systems.																			0025-3324	1948-1209				FAL	1993	27	3					34	42																WOS:A1993MM99400004
J	Jackson, LJ				Jackson, LJ			A simulation model of PCB dynamics in the Lake Ontario pelagic food web	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Salmonid stocking and reduced phosphorous loading have led to major changes in the Lake Ontario ecosystem over the last 25 years and during the last 15-20 years PCB concentrations in age 4 + lake trout have dropped from ca. 9 to 3 mg kg(-1). Here, I present a simulation model that examines PCB dynamics by coupling a dynamic prey supply to a multi-species functional response model of predation. At 1994 target levels of stocking, the model predicts that chinook salmon will increase, but alewife, lake trout and steelhead will decrease in biomass over the next 10 years. PCB concentrations of the sport fish are predicted to be 1.28, 1.77 and 3.06 mg kg(-1) for steelhead, chinook salmon and lake trout, respectively. If alewife growth rates are not reduced farther, the model predicts that alewife could recover from a severe winter mortality. Decreases in the growth rates of sport fishes were accompanied by higher PCB concentrations and lake trout always had higher PCB concentrations for a given age class than chinook salmon and steelhead. Therefore if minimal sport fish PCB concentrations are a principal goal, managers should stock less lake trout, and stock more of the faster growing and less contaminated chinook salmon and steelhead.																			0304-3800					DEC 16	1996	93	1-3					43	56		10.1016/0304-3800(95)00210-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3800(95)00210-3													WOS:A1996VZ40400006

Comparisons among budgets reveal the magnitudes of "internal" sources and sinks that cannot be directly inferred from individual budgets. A water budget indicates that .apprx. 180 .times. 106 m3 of sublacustrine spring water plus ungauged surface flow enters the lake annually-about a fifth the total inflow and two-thirds as much water as is lost to evaporation. This total ungauged inflow delivers about 90,000 t of Cl yr-1, nine times the stream input. Ca input from total ungauged flow is about a third the stream input, and the net internal Ca sink in the system is sufficient to precipitate 60,000 t of CaCO3 yr-1. Stream delivery of P, mainly as particulate material, is largely sequestered in the sediments (.apprx. 100 t yr-1). At least 1,100 t yr-1 of N, primarily as NO3- delivered by streams, are apparently lost to denitrification, while only 200 t yr-1 are sedimented. Cycling of N and P within the lake dominates over throughput in controlling standing stocks. Vertical mixing within the lake may play a dominating role in this cycling. Cycling of P in the lake can be regarded as "closed"-a sediment-water column turnover of materials with only minor hydrographic loss from the system. By contrast, N cycling is "open," with an important net loss to the atmosphere.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	1989	34	7					1202	1213		10.4319/lo.1989.34.7.1202	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1989.34.7.1202													WOS:A1989CH69800005
J	Bohacs, K; Suter, J				Bohacs, K; Suter, J			Sequence stratigraphic distribution of coaly rocks: Fundamental controls and paralic examples	AAPG BULLETIN-AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF PETROLEUM GEOLOGISTS												Significant volumes of terrigenous organic matter can be preserved to form coals only when and where the overall increase in accommodation approximately equals the production rate of peat, Accommodation is a function of subsidence and base level, For mires, base level is very specifically the groundwater table, In paralic settings, the groundwater table is strongly controlled by sea level and the precipitation/evaporation ratio. Feat accumulates over a range of rates, but always with a definite maximum rate set by original organic productivity and space available below depositional base level (groundwater table). Below a threshold accommodation rate (nonzero), no continuous peats accumulate, due to falling or low groundwater table, sedimentary bypass, and extensive erosion by fluvial channels. This is typical of upper highstand, lowstand fan, and basal lowstand-wedge systems tracts. Higher accommodation rates provide relatively stable conditions with rising groundwater tables. Mires initiate and thrive, quickly filling local accommodation vertically and expanding laterally, favoring accumulation of laterally continuous coals in paralic zones within both middle lowstand and middle highstand systems tracts, If the accommodation increase balances or slightly exceeds organic productivity, mires accumulate peat vertically, yielding thicker, more isolated coals most likely during of late lowstand-early transgressive and late transgressive-early highstand periods, At very large accommodation increases, mires are stressed and eventually inundated by clastics or standing water (as in middle transgressive systems tracts), These relations should be valid for mires in all settings, including alluvial, lake plain, and paralic, The tie to sea level in paralic zones depends on local subsidence, sediment supply, and groundwater regimes, These concepts are also useful for investigating the distribution of seal and reservoir facies in nonmarine settings.																			0149-1423					OCT	1997	81	10					1612	1639																WOS:A1997YA59300002
J	Brugioni, L; Tognetti, M; Gozzi, C				Brugioni, Lucio; Tognetti, Maurizio; Gozzi, Cristina			An unhealthy holiday on Lake Bolsena	ITALIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINE												A 70-year old man (OL) was hospitalized due to fever (up to degrees 40 C) associated with malaise and abdominal pain. Tests showed hypereosinophilic syndrome, and increased liver and inflammation indexes. Abdominal echography showed a non homogeneous liver and the spleen was enlarged. Abdominal computed tomography showed multiple abscesses on the liver. The patient reported that he had recently gone on holiday to Lake Bolsena where he had eaten raw fish. A specialist in infectious diseases confirmed that in that area there is an infestation of Opisthorchisfelineus. Analysis of blood and stool samples confirmed the presence of this parasite. The patient was treated with praziquantel with resolution of fever and improvement in clinical tests and general condition. Opisthorchis felineus is a parasite that commonly infects dogs and cats. Infection is sometimes transmitted to man and is usually related to eating raw fish, The parasite enters the liver and its eggs are found in the patient's stool samples. Acute symptoms are: fever, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and malaise. Hypereosinophilic syndrome and increase in fiver index are typical. Chronic infection could result in cholangiocarcinoma. Presence of the parasite is confirmed through specific analysis of blood and stool. Therapy consists of praziquantel or, as second choice, abendazol. In the 20th century, there were 4 epidemics in Italy, on Lakes Trasimeno and Bolsena in Central Italy. The latest epidemic was reported in that area in summer 2012.																			1877-9344	1877-9352					2013	7	1					39	42		10.4081/itjm.2013.39	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/itjm.2013.39													WOS:000216954800006

The front is formed by inflowing saltier waters of the northern Baltic proper and outflowing fresher waters from the gulf, and its position and shape are largely controlled by wind conditions. In general, the waters of the northern Baltic proper are less stratified than the outflowing less-saline waters. At the time of the study, the two major water masses differed in terms of phytoplankton community structure, both at species level and at the level of functional groups. Wind-induced vertical mixing was instrumental in bringing nutrient pulses to the upper mixed layer in the less-stratified, high-saline water mass. Nutrient pulses were followed by enhancement of primary productivity and assimilation number (primary productivity/Chl a) in cyanobacterial (> 20 mu m) and flagellate (<20 mu m) size fractions. It is proposed that mesoscale blooms of A. flos-aquae benefit from the nutrient-pulsing events. Calm weather and solar heating, as reflected by rising temperatures in the upper mixed layer and overriding of water masses in the frontal region, resulted in substantial shallowing of the upper mixed layer, which initiated the bloom of N. spumigena.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	1996	41	1					98	112		10.4319/lo.1996.41.1.0098	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1996.41.1.0098													WOS:A1996UC90700010

The eastern margin of the Tibetan plateau (TP) has been an important passageway for south -north migration of agricultural groups since the late Neolithic. Prehistoric farmers began to occupy the northeastern Tibetan plateau (NETP) and the area of modern Yunnan Province (YNP), on the southeastern margin of the TP, from similar to 5200 BP and similar to 4600 BP, respectively. This occupation was potentially closely linked to climatic and environmental changes; however, the spatiotemporal pattern of moisture variations between these two regions, and its possible impact on human settlement and the migration of farming communities along the eastern margin of the TP during the late Neolithic and Bronze Age, are unclear. In the present study, well-dated sedimentary records with unambiguous indicators of humidity variations from the NETP and YNP were integrated, along with radiocarbon dates from human and animal bones and the remains of crop plants from archaeological sites in this region. The results indicate a long-term, out-of-phase relationship of moisture variations between the NETP and YNP during the middle to late Holocene. A mid-late Holocene increase in humidity on the NETP facilitated the development of agropastoral societies during the period of similar to 5200 -2200 BP. However, pronounced cooling from similar to 5000 BP forced the southward dispersal of millet farming groups along the eastern margin of the TP during the fifth millennium BP. Decreasing moisture in YNP promoted the expansion of an open landscape, which affected the development of agriculture during the period of similar to 4600 -2200 BP. Our results suggest that changes in moisture affected the development of prehistoric agriculture in the northeastern and southeastern marginal areas of the TP in different ways, implying that the development of prehistoric human society largely depended on the regional climatic conditions.					guo, shilong/GVS-7574-2022; MA, MINMIN/GYE-2888-2022; Wu, Duo/ACI-5090-2022														2096-9457	2667-3258				JAN	2025	5	1					241	248		10.1016/j.fmre.2023.02.014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fmre.2023.02.014		JAN 2025						40166109					WOS:001427004200001

Scott			A mesocosm investigation of the effects of quagga mussels (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) on Lake Michigan zooplankton assemblages	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Dreissenid mussels are known to disrupt the base of the food web by filter feeding on phytoplankton; however, they may also directly ingest zooplankton thereby complicating their effects on plankton communities. The objective of this study was to quantify the effects of quagga mussel feeding on the composition and size structure of Lake Michigan zooplankton assemblages. Two mesocosm (six 946 L tanks) experiments were conducted in summer 2013, using quagga mussels and zooplankton collected near Beaver Island, MI, to examine the response of zooplankton communities to the presence and absence of mussels (experiment 1) and varying mussel density (experiment 2). Mesocosms were sampled daily and zooplankton taxa were enumerated and sized using microscopy and FlowCAM (R) imaging. In experiment 1, the presence of quagga mussels had a rapid negative effect on veliger and copepod nauplii abundance, and a delayed negative effect on rotifer abundance. In experiment 2, mussel density had a negative effect on veliger, nauplii, and copepodite abundance within 24 h. Multivariate analyses revealed a change in zooplanlcton community composition with increasing mussel density. Ten zoo plankton taxa decreased in abundance and frequency as quagga mussel density increased: except for the rotifer Trichocerca sp., treatments with higher mussel densities (i.e., 1327,3585, and 5389 mussels/m(2)) had the greatest negative effect on small-bodied zooplankton (<= 128 mu m). This study confirms results from small-scale (<= 1 L) experiments and demonstrates that quagga mussels can alter zooplankton communities at mesoscales (similar to 1000 L), possibly through a combination of direct consumption and resource depletion.

PLOS ONE												Background: Over the last 30 years, the Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, has rapidly spread around the world. The European distribution comprises the Mediterranean basin with a first appearance in Switzerland in 2003. Early identification of the most suitable areas in Switzerland allowing progressive invasion by this species is considered crucial to suggest adequate surveillance and control plans. Methodology/Principal Findings: We identified the most suitable areas for invasion and establishment of Ae. albopictus in Switzerland. The potential distribution areas linked to the current climatic suitability were assessed using remotely sensed land surface temperature data recorded by the MODIS satellite sensors. Suitable areas for adult survival and overwintering of diapausing eggs were also identified for future climatic conditions, considering two different climate change scenarios (A1B, A2) for the periods 2020-2049 and 2045-2074. At present, the areas around Lake Geneva in western Switzerland provide suitable climatic conditions for Ae. albopictus. In northern Switzerland, parts of the Rhine valley, around Lake Constance, as well as the surroundings of Lake Neuchatel, appear to be suitable for the survival at least of adult Ae. albopictus. However, these areas are characterized by winters currently being too cold for survival and development of diapausing eggs. In southern Switzerland, Ae. albopictus is already well-established, especially in the Canton of Ticino. For the years 2020-2049, the predicted possible spread of the tiger mosquito does not differ significantly from its potential current distribution. However, important expansions are obtained if the period is extended to the years 2045-2074, when Ae. albopictus may invade large new areas. Conclusions/Significance: Several parts of Switzerland provide suitable climatic conditions for invasion and establishment of Ae. albopictus. The current distribution and rapid spread in other European countries suggest that the tiger mosquito will colonize new areas in Switzerland in the near future.					; Rizzoli, Annapaola/J-2439-2012; Neteler, Markus/C-6328-2008; Rocchini, Duccio/B-6742-2011	Tonolla, Mauro/0000-0002-8861-7763; Rizzoli, Annapaola/0000-0003-3997-6783; Flacio, Eleonora/0000-0001-8267-6503; Rocchini, Duccio/0000-0003-0087-0594; Neteler, Markus/0000-0003-1916-1966; Guidi, Valeria/0000-0001-5553-3136													1932-6203					DEC 13	2013	8	12							e82090	10.1371/journal.pone.0082090	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0082090								24349190					WOS:000328734200026
J	Sharma, BK				Sharma, B. K.			Zooplankton communities of Deepor Beel (a Ramsar site), Assam (N. E. India): ecology, richness, and abundance	TROPICAL ECOLOGY												Limnological studies undertaken at two sampling stations of Deepor Beel (91 degrees 35' - 91 degrees 43' E, 26 degrees 05' - 26 degrees 11' N) revealed the presence of 171 and 160 species of zooplankton at stations I and II, respectively. Species richness in different months ranged between 96 +/- 11 and 97 +/- 13 (mean +/- SD) and community similarities across months between 48.9 - 88.1 % and 53.1 - 89.7 % at stations I and II, respectively. Richness, which was mainly influenced by Rotifera (110 species) and Cladocera (45 species), showed significant variations between months but not between stations. Zooplankton (475 +/- 114, 459 +/- 128 n l(-1) at stations I and II, respectively) formed an important quantitative component of the net plankton. Rotifera and Cladocera dominated quantitatively, Copepoda and Rhizopoda formed sub-dominant groups, and Ostracoda and Conchostraca had very low densities. Zooplankton abundance varied significantly between both months and stations. At both stations, richness and abundance inversely correlated with water temperature and rainfall, and positively with specific conductivity and dissolved oxygen. While at station II both richness and abundance also positively correlated with transparency, alkalinity, and hardness, at station I, abundance positively correlated with free CO2. Finally, zooplankton richness and abundance oscillated with annual frequency but showed winter peaks, was not quantitatively dominated by any individual species, and was characterized by higher species diversity with equitable abundance of various species. In view of the paucity of works from the floodplain lakes of India, this study provides important information on zooplankton diversity and ecology of the sampled Ramsar site.																			0564-3295	2661-8982				SEP	2011	52	3					293	302																WOS:000293678100007

The general pattern of temperature changes inferred from chironomids during the Late Glacial [i.e. cold temperatures between ca. 16,500 and 14,800 cal BP, close to present-day temperature between 15,000 and 13,000 cal BP and colder temperatures during the Younger Dryas (YD)], and the major temperature changes of the Holocene (i.e. the Younger Dryas-Holocene transition and the Late Holocene cooling trend) at Egelsee, were mirrored in other European climate reconstructions using various proxies. However, the amplitude of temperature changes during the YD was smaller than reconstructed by other proxies at various sites, and the 8,200 years BP event was not apparent. These differences between records were probably due to the dominance of Corynocera ambigua, with percentages reaching 60% in parts of the Egelsee sequence. This taxon was not present in any of the 103 lakes used for the transfer function and its absence may have yielded less accurate inferences. Its presence in samples only associated with cold inferences at Egelsee suggests that this taxon is a cold indicator. However, it was also found in warm Danish lakes and the factors that determine the presence of C. ambigua remain unexplained. Most samples had a poor fit to temperature and instead, dissolved organic carbon seemed to be a factor influencing the chironomid assemblages during the Holocene. These results illustrate the need to better understand the ecology of chironomids and to disentangle the various factors that affect chironomid communities through time. Ultimately, such information will lead to more accurate temperature reconstructions.

Crust-mantle interactions during subduction of oceanic & continental crust	GEOLOGICAL FIELD TRIPS												This excursion is aimed at illustrating oceanic and continental tectonometamorphic sequences and their interactions with ultramafics during Alpine subduction at (U) HP conditions. The first day is dedicated to the visit of the tectonometamorphic sequences of the Monviso meta-ophiolitic massif. The Monviso Massif is one of the best preserved relics of oceanic crust in the western Alps that formed during opening of the Mesozoic western Alpine Tethys and that underwent HP metamorphism during Alpine subduction. This fieldtrip gives the almost unique chance to see and appreciate different portions of the ancient ocean floor along a mountain trail. Among the various lithologies, we will see serpentinite, Mg-Al and Fe-Ti metagabbro, eclogite, metabasite, metasediments and minor metaperidotite. The fieldtrip itinerary is located in a high mountain landscape in front of the pyramid of Monviso (3841 m), which is the symbol of the Cottian Alps. The excursion starts from the spring of the Po river at Pian del Re and reaches three spectacular mountain lakes (Lago Fiorenza, Lago Chiaretto and Lago Superiore), through a typical glacial landscape. The second day excursion proposes a "petrographic" itinerary in the core of the world-famous UHP Brossasco-Isasca Unit (Dora-Maira Massif), allowing to observe the most spectacular evidence of both its pre-Alpine and Alpine metamorphic evolution. We will visit the famous pyrope-bearing whiteschist outcrop of Case Ramello (south of Case Parigi) where coesite was first discovered in continental crust, a spectacular metagranite with UHP coronitic mineral assemblage and an exceptionally well preserved relict of pre-Alpine igneous intrusive contact (basement xenoliths within metagranitoids).					; Ferrando, Simona/AAG-6808-2020	Ferrando, Simona/0000-0002-8175-8096; 													2038-4947						2014	6	1					6	73																WOS:000421716100001

Radiophysical Monitoring of the Lake Baikal Ice Cover	GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES												Presented are the results of the winter 2014 radiophysical expedition, within the framework of which the Baikal ice cover was investigated by electromagnetic methods. The primary objectives the expedition were to detect irregularities in the ice cover, such as cracks and thawing steamed holes in the ice, and to determine the ice thickness and structure in the area of the thawing holes by the GPR sounding method. We used in the experiments the OKO-2 ground-penetrating radar (GPR) of the decimeter band and the nanosecond radar with the wavelength of 3 cm. The measurements were made carried out from the Khivus hovercraft and from the UAZ automobile. The ice thickness of Lake Baikal was determined by non-contact electromagnetic measurement methods. Radargrams of reflected signals from the ice cover are presented. Radar patterns of reflected signals from artificial irregularities of the ice cover were obtained by the short-pulse radar method. The concept of radiophysical monitoring is suggested, which provides a means of determining the ice cover parameters of a water body with high spatial resolution. We present an integral approach to investigating the conditions of the ice cover in order to integrate different physicochemical methods for diagnosing the objects studied. A further development of the concept of integrated ice cover research, and the creation of the monitoring network involves solving a number of scientific and engineering tasks that include developing physical models and information and measurement systems as well as the rationale for an integrated monitoring network.

Among various environmental mediums, groundwater holds significant importance as it serves as a crucial resource for potable water supply and agricultural practices. However, the persistent use of antibiotic-contaminated groundwater can lead to prolonged exposure to these agents in human and ecological systems, thereby engendering serious apprehensions, including the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains. Therefore, in this study, the concentration of antibiotics in groundwater within densely populated livestock farming areas was analyzed using UHPLC-q-orbitrap HRMS combined with online solid-phase extraction. The measured cumulative concentrations of antibiotics in the groundwater samples collected from the surveyed areas ranged from 15.8 ng L-1 to 1530.0 ng L-1. The residual antibiotics obtained from the surveyed region exhibited significant seasonal variation, with higher concentrations observed during summer. This seasonal pattern is attributed to the combined effects of agricultural activities and climatic factors. The concentrations of antibiotics in the investigated area demonstrated associations between the composition of livestock species and the density of livestock farming facilities. Specifically, veterinary-specific antibiotics (sulfaquinoxaline [SQX] and clopidol [CLO]), commonly employed in poultry farming, were found to be more prominent in the area with a high concentration of poultry farming facilities. In regions characterized by a dense poultry farm presence, the highest concentrations of SQX and CLO were founded at 135.7 ng L-1 and 178.6 ng L-1, respectively. In contrast, areas without any farms exhibited lower concentrations, measuring 39.9 ng L-1 for SQX and 10.1 ng L-1 for CLO. Similarly, antibiotics primarily used in swine farming showed a strong correlation with the presence of large-scale swine farming operations. In the case of sulfamethazine, which is commonly used in pig farming, concentrations exceeding 500 ng L-1 were observed in groundwater samples collected near large-scale swine farming facilities. These observations suggest that antibiotics are introduced into groundwater through the discharge of wastewater and excreta from livestock farming facilities. Consequently, this study establishes that regional variations in antibiotic concentrations within groundwater are influenced by factors such as local usage patterns, the scale and types of livestock farming, and the prevailing climatic conditions. In order to elucidate the precise associations between multiple sources of contamination, including livestock farming facilities, and to enhance our understanding of their spatial correlations, there appears to be a need for research focused on spatial correlation analysis.

Grosser Muggelsee, Germany, needs to be converted into a meso- to eutrophic level by means of restoration of the catchment area. Despite efforts in phosphorus (P) loading reduction in the inflow, this polymictic lake still demonstrates an year-to-year fluctuating and strong internal P loading with increasing porewater phosphate concentrations during summer due to formation of anoxic microlayers at the sediment surface. This P release is indirectly governed by external factors including the supply of dissolved oxygen and nitrate via inflow (high runoff), changes in land use (e.g., decreasing nitrogen fertilization) and climatic factors, and is facilitated by wind-induced rapid changes of stratification and mixing events. Important management implications are: first, declines in nitrate concentrations in the inflow may result in depletion of electron accepters with respect to phosphate desorption and increase the P release. Second, the P release will continue for a long period and thus delay the recovery of the lake. In dredging the uppermost 1 m sediment layer, the P content of the sediment would decrease from 3.5 to between 0.5 and 1.0 mg P g dry weight(-1) and result in reduced capability of internal P loading. Because of the high costs, a decision should be made about dredging or whether the limnological improvement of the lake can be achieved via dephosphorization between 11 and 16 years.																			0018-8158					JAN 17	1997	342						9	26		10.1023/A:1017079029053	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017079029053													WOS:A1997WZ13900003

Watershed-Induced Limnological and Microbial Status in Two Oligotrophic Andean Lakes Exposed to the Same Climatic Scenario	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Laguna Negra and Lo Encanado are two oligotrophic Andean lakes forming part of the system fed by meltwater from distinct glacial tongues of the Echaurren glacier in central Chile, which is in a recession period. The recent increase in temperature and decline in precipitation have led to an increase of glacial meltwater and sediments entering these lakes. Although the lacustrine systems are also hydrogeologically connected, the limnology of the lakes is strongly controlled by the surface processes related to the respective sub-watersheds and hydrology. Watershed characteristics (area and length, slope, lithology, resistance to erosion, among others) affect the chemical and physical characteristics of both lakes (e.g., nutrient concentration and turbidity). We studied physical and chemical variables and performed 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to determine the specific microbial signature of the lakes. The transparency, temperature, turbidity and concentrations of chlorophyll-a, dissolved organic matter, nutrients and the total number of cells, revealed the different status of both lakes at the time of sampling. The predominant bacterial groups in both lakes were Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Bacteroidetes. Interestingly, the contribution of phototrophs was significantly higher in LN compared to LE (13 and 4% respectively) and the major fraction corresponded to Anoxygenic Phototrophs (AP) represented by Chloroflexi, Alpha, and Betaproteobacteria. Multivariate analyses showed that the nutrient levels and the light availability of both lakes, which finally depend on the hydrological characteristics of the respective watersheds, explain the differential community composition/function. The abundance of a diverse photoheterotrophic bacterioplankton community suggests that the ability to utilize solar energy along with organic and inorganic substrates is a key function in these oligotrophic mountain lakes.					; Chong, Guillermo/MAH-3688-2025; Demergasso, Cecilia/A-7392-2013; Echeverria-Vega, Alex/B-5546-2009; Blanco, Yolanda/OIR-7874-2025; Paz, Mercedes/F-3517-2015; chong, guillermo/MAH-3688-2025; Echeverría, Alex/KHZ-2715-2024; Parro, Victor/K-3788-2014	Luque, Jose A./0009-0005-0116-5039; Demergasso, Cecilia/0000-0003-4563-3066; Echeverria-Vega, Alex/0000-0002-0110-1079; Moreno-Paz, Mercedes/0000-0003-1245-3253; Guajardo, Mariela/0000-0001-7865-9751; Parro, Victor/0000-0003-3738-0724; chong, guillermo/0000-0003-2979-8864; 														1664-302X				MAR 5	2018	9								357	10.3389/fmicb.2018.00357	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2018.00357								29556224					WOS:000426687600001

Synchronous with eruptive activity, oceanic plateau basalts in this region were intruded by tonalitic batholiths, which fed intermediate to felsic volcanic cones and associated mass-flow sediment aprons. A sedimentary succession capping the volcanic pile records stream-induced channel incision into upraised basalt and tonalite, feeding sediment to a delta complex. Base-level rise caused the incised channels to backfill, stromatolitic carbonates to develop in shallow-marine areas, and finally, deposition of iron formation to dominate. A Mesoarchean terrane was also examined in the Wallace Lake area of Manitoba. Here a kilometer-thick, transgressive succession records a transition from fluvial to delta-front to prodelta turbiditic environments, with eventual drowning and siliciclastic sediment starvation leading to dominance by carbonate and iron formation deposition. Sedimentary rocks that cap the oceanic Cretaceous to Holocene Kerguelen Plateau are a direct analogue for the depositional environments, sediment source rocks, and drowning events that define the stratigraphy of the Mesoarchean successions studied here. The Steep Rock-Lumby oceanic plateau formed and actively grew during an interval of 230 m.y. This sequence produces serious problems for Mesoarchean tectonic models in which increased heat dissipation produces fast spreading or numerous spreading ridges. A Mesoarchean, mantle plume-dominated heat dissipation process is in much better agreement with the data presented here.

Effects of shoreline permafrost thaw on nutrient dynamics and diatom ecology in a subarctic tundra pond	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												In permafrost landscapes, ponds and lakes are ubiquitous and important features that support long-term carbon storage and diverse diatom communities. With climate warming, thermokarst lake expansion may modify the ability of these aquatic systems to maintain these functions, as a consequence of changes to nutrient inputs and cycling. A recent (2006-2008) thermokarst shoreline expansion event adjacent to small Frisbee Pond, in the Hudson Bay Lowlands, Canada, presented an opportunity to evaluate the effects of thaw-driven disturbance on pond nutrient dynamics. A sediment core was collected in 2015 and analysed for diatom assemblage composition, total nutrient (carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus) accumulation rates, and stable isotopes of organic carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15). Results indicate that recent shoreline expansion in this subarctic peatland pond caused an increase in total diatom accumulation, although shifts in diatom community composition were initiated prior to the shoreline slump, particularly an increase in the relative abundance of Denticula kuetzingii. Nutrient accumulation rates in the sediment increased dramatically both prior to and following shoreline slumping, with isotope values indicating an increased supply of allochthonous carbon and atmospheric nitrogen. Investigations of hydroclimate conditions prior to the shoreline slump indicate warming of summer air temperatures and an increase in precipitation over the long-term mean, consistent with changing climate conditions that caused thermokarst disturbance in other permafrost environments. This study has important implications for understanding hydro-ecological responses of small surface water bodies to general climate forcing, in combination with rapid thermokarst shoreline expansion, under a changing climate.					; Hall, Roland/K-3165-2019; Macrae, Merrin/KPB-7902-2024; Volik, Olena/ABH-8956-2020	Morison, Matthew/0000-0002-5989-7559; Macrae, Merrin/0000-0003-3296-3103; Volik, Olena/0000-0003-4949-1974; Hall, Roland/0000-0002-0314-6449; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				AUG	2019	62	2					151	163		10.1007/s10933-019-00082-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-019-00082-4													WOS:000474473800003

Reconstruction of limnology and microbialite formation conditions from carbonate clumped isotope thermometry	GEOBIOLOGY												Quantitative tools for deciphering the environment of microbialite formation are relatively limited. For example, the oxygen isotope carbonate-water geothermometer requires assumptions about the isotopic composition of the water of formation. We explored the utility of using 'clumped' isotope thermometry as a tool to study the temperatures of microbialite formation. We studied microbialites recovered from water depths of 10-55 m in Pavilion Lake, and 10-25 m in Kelly Lake, spanning the thermocline in both lakes. We determined the temperature of carbonate growth and the O-18/O-16 ratio of the waters that microbialites grew in. Results were then compared to current limnological data from the lakes to reconstruct the history of microbialite formation. Modern microbialites collected at shallow depths (11.7 m) in both lakes yield clumped isotope-based temperatures of formation that are within error of summer water temperatures, suggesting that clumped isotope analyses may be used to reconstruct past climates and to probe the environments in which microbialites formed. The deepest microbialites (21.7-55 m) were recovered from below the present-day thermoclines in both lakes and yield radioisotope ages indicating they primarily formed earlier in the Holocene. During this time, pollen data and our reconstructed water O-18/O-16 ratios indicate a period of aridity, with lower lake levels. At present, there is a close association between both photosynthetic and heterotrophic communities, and carbonate precipitation/microbialite formation, with biosignatures of photosynthetic influences on carbonate detected in microbialites from the photic zone and above the thermocline (i.e., depths of generally <20 m). Given the deeper microbialites are receiving <1% of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), it is likely these microbialites primarily formed when lower lake levels resulted in microbialites being located higher in the photic zone, in warm surface waters.

The selected seismic events are part of a large data set of over 80,000 seismic events acquired with a dense seismic network deployed in order to study the yearly rapid drainage of Gornersee lake, a nearby ice-marginal lake. Using simple frequency and distance scaling and Green's functions for a homogeneous half-space, we calculated moment tensor solutions for icequakes with M-w - 1.5 using a full-waveform inversion method usually applied to moderate seismic events (M-w > 4) recorded at local to regional distances (approximate to 50-700 km). Inversions from typical shallow events are shown to represent tensile crack openings. This explains well the dominating Rayleigh waves and compressive first motions observed at all recording seismograms. As these characteristics can be observed in most icequake signals, we believe that the vast majority of icequakes recorded in the 2 yr is due to tensile faulting, most likely caused by surface crevasse openings. We also identified a shallow cluster with somewhat atypical waveforms in that they show less dominant Rayleigh waves and quadrantal radiation patterns of first motions. Their moment tensors are dominated by a large double-couple component, which is strong evidence for shear faulting. Although less than a dozen such icequakes have been identified, this is a substantial result as it shows that shear faulting in glacier ice is generally possible even in the absence of extreme flow changes such as during glacier surges. A third source of icequakes was located at 100 m depth. These sources can be represented by tensile crack openings. Because of the high-hydrostatic pressure within the ice at these depths, these events are most likely related to the presence of water lenses that reduce the effective stress to allow for tensile faulting.

Phylogeographic structure in an Australian freshwater shrimp largely pre-dates the geological origins of its landscape	HEREDITY												The phylogeographic structure of cryptic lineages within the freshwater shrimp Caridina indistincta Calman, 1926 (Decapoda: Atyidae) was investigated in an attempt to unravel any potential genetic influences of Quaternary sea-level oscillations. The study was based on mitochondrial DNA sequences from specimens from lakes and creeks in the sand dune areas of southeast Queensland, eastern Australia. Four divergent lineages were identified, two of which were from Moreton and North (N.) Stradbroke Islands. Lineage 'C1' has been found only on Moreton Island and the western part of N. Stradbroke Island, whereas 'C2' was found on the eastern side of N. Stradbroke Island and a few locations on the mainland. These diverged from each other during the Late Miocene/Pliocene and so are older than the current landscape in which they are found. Small-scale phylogeographic analysis of C1 identified four separate geographic areas, within the two islands, whose divergences date to the Pleistocene (similar to 100-300 thousand years ago ('kya')). The N. Stradbroke Island population of C2 also diverged from the mainland during the Pleistocene, as did a sympatric freshwater fish Rhadinocentrus ornatus Regan, 1914 (Melanotaeniidae). This implies that the ice- age sealevel changes may have structured these populations, although there is little observable influence of the last glacial maximum (similar to 18 kya). Most estimates for the age of the landscape (dunes, lakes) also fall within the Pleistocene and so the effect of sea- level change may be seen both in biology and geology.					hughes, jane/C-5321-2008; Page, Timothy/B-9000-2008	Page, Timothy/0000-0002-3521-3503													0018-067X					APR	2007	98	4					222	231		10.1038/sj.hdy.6800932	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.hdy.6800932								17213864					WOS:000245270900007

On the Colorado Plateau, this formation accumulated behind and downwind of a subduction-related volcanic arc along the western margin of North America. The ash in these distal fallout tuffs probably drifted eastward from coignimbrite ash clouds related to collapse calderas. Altered volcanic ash is particularly abundant in the Brushy Basin Member of the upper part of the Morrison Formation. In one 110-m-thick section in eastern Utah, 35 separate beds were deposited in a 2.2 m.y. period. Alteration occurred when glassy volcanic ash fell into fluvial and lacustrine environments, where it was diagenetically altered to various mineral assemblages but most commonly to smectitic clay. Periodically, ash fell into saline, alkaline lakes, and diagenetic alteration of the glassy ash produced a crudely zoned deposit on the Colorado Plateau. Altered volcanic ash beds in the outermost part of the lacustrine deposits are argillic (with smectitic clay), whereas zeolitic (clinoptilolite, analcime) and feldspathic (K-feldspar and albite) alteration dominates the interior zones. Feldspathic ash layers contain secondary silica, and consequently immobile element (e.g., Al, Ti, and high field strength elements) abundances were strongly diluted in these rocks. In contrast, the argillic ash beds experienced strong SiO 2 depletion, and, as a result, they are enriched in the relatively immobile elements. The compositions of the zeolitic ash beds are intermediate between these two extremes and experienced the least alteration. As a result of these changes, immobile element concentrations are less reliable than ratios for determining the original magmatic composition of the ash. Most of the altered ash (regardless of type) was also depleted in water-soluble elements like the alkalies, U, and V. The latter two elements were oxidized during diagenesis of the ash, became soluble, and were partially leached away by groundwater. Locally, U and V in groundwater were reduced upon contact with organic materials and formed important ore deposits. Several aspects of the mineralogy and geochemistry of the altered volcanic ash beds yield information about their original magmatic compositions. The volcanic ash beds typically have small phenoclasts of quartz, sanidine, plagioclase, biotite, zircon, apatite, and Fe-Ti oxides. Titanite is present in similar to 40% of the ash beds; pyroxene and amphibole were found in less than 5%. Phenocryst assemblages, mineral compositions, inferred high fO(2), rare earth element patterns, and immobile element ratios all suggest the parent magmas for the altered tuffs were subduction-related dacites and rhyolites. Small numbers of tuffs have Fe-rich biotite, amphibole, and/or clinopyroxene; both pyroxene and amphibole are alkali rich. These tuffs lack titanite, but some contain anorthoclase and F-rich apatite. Combined with enrichments in Nb and Y, these features show some tuffs had an A-type character and were related to some type of within-arc extension. Paleowind directions, and distribution, radiometric ages, and compositions of the volcanic ash beds and of plutons in the western United States suggest that the most likely eruption sites were in the subduction-related Jurassic magmatic arc, which extended across western Utah and central Nevada and southward into the Mojave of California and southern Arizona (present-day coordinates). Pb isotopic compositions show that at least some of the ash was erupted from magma systems (now exposed as plutons) in the Mojave Desert. We conclude that a brief ignimbrite flare-up from 157 to 150 Ma, but focused on the time period from 152 to 150 Ma, in this region may have been driven by slab steepening and conversion to a strike-slip boundary after a preceding phase of folding and thrusting. The presence of ash beds with A-type characteristics mixed with those that have more typical subduction signatures confirms that the Late Jurassic was geologically a transitional time in North America when subduction was changing to transtensional movement along the western plate boundary.					; Christiansen, Eric/A-8948-2009	Christiansen, Eric/0000-0002-1108-5260; 													0072-1077		978-0-8137-2513-0				2015	513						399	439		10.1130/2015.2513(11)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/2015.2513(11)	10.1130/SPE513												WOS:000540530400012

Modelling of Physical Processes and Assessment of Climate Change Impacts in Great Bear Lake	ATMOSPHERE-OCEAN												Polar lakes are highly sensitive to changes in the climate. As a contribution to the International Polar Year (IPY), the impact of climate warming on the thermal characteristics of Great Bear Lake is studied. During the summer of 2008, time series observations of meteorological, hydrological and physical limnological parameters in the lake were obtained to characterize the thermal regime. These observations and the forecasted forcing from a regional version of the Canadian operational Global Environmental Multiscale (GEM) model are used to simulate the ice-free hydrodynamics in Great Bear Lake using the high-resolution, three-dimensional hydrodynamic Princeton Ocean Model (POM). The model results of surface and sub-surface temperatures are first compared with satellite and in-lake measurements. The model simulates weak stratification and predicts mean cyclonic circulation reasonably well. The impact of climate warming caused by greenhouse gases is studied using Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM) scenarios for the base climate (1970-2000) and future warmer climate (2041-70). This scenario predicts an increase in surface temperature of over 2 degrees C in the northeast corner, whereas in the rest of the lake the increases vary from 0.5 degrees to 1 degrees C. The results show that brief thermal stratification is possible in the deeper waters. The increase in water temperature caused by climate warming in the lake appears largely because of the positive increase in net longwave radiation and sensible heat flux, which result from changes in the temperature gradient between the air and the lake and slightly reduced wind speeds in the climate warming projections.					黄, 安宁/K-7473-2019														0705-5900	1480-9214					2012	50	3			SI		317	333		10.1080/07055900.2012.668492	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07055900.2012.668492													WOS:000308988900006

A decline of the sucker population in the lake over the past few decades has been partly attributed to adverse water quality conditions, including elevated pH and ammonia concentrations that occur during summer cyanobacterial blooms. We quantitatively analyzed structural changes in gills of larval Lost River suckers after they were exposed to elevated pH and ammonia concentrations for 30 d. Exposure to pH as high as 10 caused no observed structural changes. However, lamellar thickness and O-2 diffusion distance increased significantly (P<0.05) at ammonia concentrations that did not significantly decrease survival, growth, whole-body ion concentrations, or swimming performance. Additionally, we qualitatively observed increases in the frequency of hyperplasic and hypertrophic mucous cells, tissue damage, epithelial lifting, and infiltration of white blood cells into paracellular lymphatic spaces at the highest sublethal ammonia concentration. These observed gill changes typically indicate compromised respiratory and ionoregulatory capacity, although such effects were not manifested in the assays we performed. Regardless, these structural gill changes appear to be a more sensitive indicator of exposure to elevated ammonia concentrations than are more traditional sublethal indices. Therefore, gill histopathology might be a relevant early-warning monitoring tool of the health of Lost River suckers in Upper Klamath Lake, and other species in similar eutrophic systems.

Biotransformation of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and bioformation of hydroxylated PCBs in fish	AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY												Hydroxylated PCBs (OH-PCBs) are a class of organic contaminants that have been found recently in the plasma of Great Lakes fish, the source of which is either bioformation from PCBs or accumulation from the environment. To address the potential for fish to biotransform PCBs and bioform OH-PCBs juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss; similar to 80 g) were exposed to dietary concentrations of an environmentally relevant mixture of PCBs. Eight OH-PCBs were found in the plasma of rainbow trout after 30 days of exposure to the PCBs, the relative pattern of which was similar to those observed in wild lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) from Lake Ontario. Hydroxylated-PCBs were not found (detection limit 0.02 pg/g) in the food or control (not PCB-exposed) fish. A curvilinear log t(1/2)-log K-ow relationship for recalcitrant PCBs was found, similar to previously reported relationships, although t(1/2) values were longer and shorter than studies using smaller fish or cooler temperatures, respectively. A number of PCB congeners fell below the log t(1/2)-log K-ow relationship providing the first estimates of non-chiral PCB biotransformation rates in fish. Enantioselective degradation of the chiral congeners PCBs 91 and 136, also indicated biotransformation. Biotransformation of PCBs was structure-dependent with greater biotransformation of PCBs with vicinal hydrogen atoms in the metalpara positions, suggesting CYP 2B-like biotransformation. Other chiral congeners with a metalpara substitution pattern showed no enantioselective degradation but were biotransformed based on the log t(1/2)-log K-ow relationship. The results of this study demonstrate that laboratory held rainbow trout can biotransform a number of PCB congeners and that bioformation is likely an important source of OH-PCBs in wild salmonids of the Great Lakes.

Six of these lakes were chosen to be as similar as possible in all respects except surface area (the Northwest Ontario Lake Size Series [NOLSS], which range from 88 to 35,000 ha). Spatial and temporal variability of pCO(2) within a single lake was no greater in the larger lakes than in the smaller lakes. Interannual variability was significant and synchronous, which indicates that weather patterns were important and affected the different lakes within the region in a similar manner. However, annual pCO(2) averages were not related to annual differences in planktonic photosynthetic activity, measured by (CO2)-C-14 fixation. In the six NOLSS lakes, there was not a significant relationship of average pCO(2) with lake size. For all 11 lakes, however, there was a significant negative correlation of pCO(2) with lake size, which was likely due to several characteristics of the very small and very large lakes that covaried with size. The larger lakes were deeper and had longer water residence times and lower DOC, which suggests lower CO2 production from allochthonous organic carbon inputs. Also, the ratio of epilimnetic sediment area/epilimnetic volume (A(e)V(e)) was smaller in the larger lakes, which likely resulted in lower rates of recycling of fixed carbon to CO2 during summer stratification.

Firstly, the availability of O2 or NO3- as electron acceptors determines the depth profiles of ciliates. Large quantities of ciliates and even maximum numbers were found at depths where no O2 could be detected. If NO3- also disappeared during the summer stagnation period, the biomass of protozoa was strongly reduced. NO2- peaks generally corresponded with ciliate peaks. An extension of Finlay''s findings (dissimilatory nitrate reductase within the inner mitochondrial membrane) to other ciliate groups is hypothesized. Secondly, the biomass development of hypolimnetic ciliates was strongly correlated with the bacterial biomass registered .apprx. 2 wk before (r2 = 0.891, n = 14). The biomass of bacteria, on the other hand, was dependent upon the sedimentation rate of organic C (r2 = 0.850, n = 15), if a time lag of .apprx. 2 wk was taken into account. Therefore a total time lag of .apprx. 4 wk was assumed to take place between sedimentation of organic substance and the corresponding increase in ciliate biomass (r2 = 0.853, n = 14). Bacteria were an important intermediate link in the food chain of the hypolimnion. They appear to represent the principal energy source for pelagic ciliates. Sedimentation of organic C, N and P is the driving force for the establishment of the hypolimnetic microbial community.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1985	121	2					111	120		10.1007/BF00008713	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008713													WOS:A1985ADD3300003

Patterns and processes of salt efflorescences in the McMurdo region, Antarctica	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Evaporite salts are abundant around the McMurdo region, Antarctica (similar to 78 degrees S) due to very low precipitation, low relative humidity, and limited overland flow. Hygroscopic salts in the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDVs) are preferentially formed in locations where liquid water is present in the austral summer, including along ephemeral streams, ice-covered lake boundaries, or shallow groundwater tracks. In this study, we collected salts from the Miers, Garwood, and Taylor Valleys on the Antarctic continent, as well as around McMurdo Station on Ross Island in close proximity to water sources with the goal of understanding salt geochemistry in relationship to the hydrology of the area. Halite is ubiquitous; sodium is the major cation (ranging from 70%-90% of cations by meq kg(-1) sediment) and chloride is the major anion (>50%) in nearly all samples. However, a wide variety of salt phases and morphologies are tentatively identified through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) work. We present new data that identifies trona (Na-3(CO3)(HCO3)center dot 2H(2)O), tentative gaylussite (Na2Ca(CO3)(2)center dot 5H(2)O), and tentative glauberite (Na2Ca(SO4)(2)) in the MDV, of which the later one has not been documented previously. Our work allows for the evaluation of processes that influence brine evolution on a local scale, consequently informing assumptions underlying large-scale processes (such as paleoclimate) in the MDV. Hydrological modeling conducted in FREZCHEM and PHREEQC suggests that a model based on aerosol deposition alone in low elevations on the valley floor inadequately characterizes salt distributions found on the surfaces of the soil because it does not account for other hydrologic inputs/outputs. Implications for the salt distributions include their use as tracers for paleolake levels, geochemical tracers of ephemeral water tracks or "wet patches" in the soil, indicators of chemical weathering products, and potential delineators of ecological communities.

In the past few years, MP pollution in freshwater systems, particularly rivers and subsequently in freshwater organisms, especially in fish, has caught the attention of researchers. Rivers provide livelihood to approximately 40 % of the global population through food and potable water. Hence, assessment of emerging contaminants like microplastics in rivers and the associated fauna is crucial. This study assessed microplastics (MPs) in fish, sediment and freshwater samples across the third largest riverine system of peninsular India, the Mahanadi River. The number concentrations of MPs measured in water, sediment and fish ranged from 337.5 +/- 54.4-1333.3 +/- 557.2 MPs/m(3), 14.7 +/- 3.7-69.3 +/- 10.1 MPs/kg. Dry weight and 0.4-3.2 MPs/Fish, respectively. Surprisingly, MPs were found in every second fish sample, with a higher MP number in the gut than in the gills. Black and blue coloured filaments with <0.5 mm size were the dominant MPs with polypropylene and polyethylene polymers in abundance. The Polymer Hazard Index (PHI) and the Potential Ecological Risk Index (PERI) studies revealed that the majority of the sampling sites fell in Risk category V (dangerous category). An irregular trend in the MP concentration was observed downstream of the river, though relatively elevated MP concentrations in water and fish samples were observed downstream of the river. t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE) unveiled distinct patterns in MP distribution with a higher similarity exhibited in the MPs found in fish gill and gut samples, unlike water and sediment, which shared certain characteristics. The findings in the current study contribute to filling the knowledge gap of MP assessment and accumulation in global freshwater systems and highlight the microplastic contamination and accumulation in fish with its potential implications on human health.					; Darbha, Gopala/F-8827-2011	Darbha, Gopala Krishna/0000-0003-2635-4037; Mandal, Abhishek/0000-0003-4565-246X; ARYA, LAVISH/0009-0000-4182-0206; TALIB, MOHMMED/0000-0002-0906-011X													0166-445X	1879-1514				JUL	2024	272								106944	10.1016/j.aquatox.2024.106944	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2024.106944		JUN 2024						38823071					WOS:001262203200001
J	Omar, S; Grealish, G; Roy, W				Omar, Samira; Grealish, Gerard; Roy, Waleed			Types and extent of soil contamination in Greater Al-Burqan oil field, Kuwait	KUWAIT JOURNAL OF SCIENCE & ENGINEERING												During the Iraqi aggression in 1990 and 1991, Kuwait's oil wells were damaged and set on. fire, resulting in oil contamination of the soil. Contamination of the environment occurred from oil spreading over the land surface and penetrating the soil to varying depths, aerial fall-out from oil spray and combustion products from oil fires, and the formation of oil lakes on the land surface. The aim of this survey was to determine the magnitude of damage in the Greater Al-Burqan oil field area (56,245 ha) for the purpose of providing information to aid subsequent land use planning and determination of remediation options. Objectives of the survey were to categorize the types of damage, map the extent of damage, and estimate the volume of contaminated soil. An approach based on soil survey concepts was adopted. The key variables measured were contamination depth, total petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations, oil contamination concentration using laser-induced fluorescence, soil colour, soil texture, soil consistance and site location. The reconnaissance field survey identified four observable types of oil contaminated soil layers (liquid oil, oily soil, tar mat and soot), plus a 'clean' soil type where no oil contamination was observed. The mean volume of contamination was estimated at about 24.4 million cubic meters. The bulk of the oil-contaminated soil occurs in the dry oil lake areas (70%) and the oil lake areas (24%), and oily soil is the dominant type of contaminated soil layer.					; Omar, Samira/KII-1287-2024	Omar Asem, Samira/0009-0009-5358-2909; 													1024-8684					DEC	2006	33	2					89	99																WOS:000243630600007

A time series of environmental tracer data from deep, meromictic Lake Lugano, Switzerland	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												An 11-yr (1990-2001) time series of tritium-helium-3 ((3)H-(3)He) apparent water ages as well as one sulfur hexafluoride (SF(6)) profile were used to study the development of the vertical mixing dynamics of the deep, meromictic northern basin of Lake Lugano. The density stratification of the water column was dominated by an increase in dissolved ions with depth, which remained approximately constant during the 1990s. The deep-water temperature increased steadily during this period, passing a threshold above which cooling of the surface water could force convection. However, increasingly mild winter temperatures prevented the occurrence of a turnover until 2005. The maximum apparent (3)H-(3)He water age increased from about 16 yr in 1990 to 23 yr in 2001. The maximum apparent SF(6) age in 2001 was 12.8 yr. The large difference between the apparent (3)H-(3)He and SF(6) ages is at least partly due to nonlinear effects of mixing, causing SF6 ages to underestimate the true mean deep-water residence time, whereas (3)H-(3)He ages overestimate it. The decreasing concentrations of (3)H and (3)He are more reliable indicators of the continuous deep-water exchange in the lake than are the apparent ages. Budget calculations using the tracer concentrations reveal an annual renewal of the deep water below 100 in in depth by about 8% and enable the calculation of long-term mean profiles of the effective vertical turbulent diffusivity K(z). No trend in the mixing intensity during the 1990s could be determined. The radiogenic He flux into the lake is comparable to estimates of the whole crustal degassing flux.

In this study, field measurements were conducted at Wuliangsuhai Lake, a typical lake in the semi-arid cold area of China, to investigate the diurnal variation of the ice surface albedo. Observations showed that the diurnal variations of the ice surface albedo exhibit bimodal characteristics with peaks occurring after sunrise and before sunset. The curve of ice surface albedo with time is affected by weather conditions. The first peak occurs later on cloudy days compared with sunny days, whereas the second peak appears earlier on cloudy days. Four probability density distribution functions-Laplace, Gauss, Gumbel, and Cauchy-were combined linearly to model the daily variation of the lake ice albedo on a sunny day. The simulations of diurnal variation in the albedo during the period from sunrise to sunset with a solar altitude angle higher than 5 degrees indicate that the Laplace combination is the optimal statistical model. The Laplace combination can not only describe the bimodal characteristic of the diurnal albedo cycle when the solar altitude angle is higher than 5 degrees, but also reflect the U-shaped distribution of the diurnal albedo as the solar altitude angle exceeds 15 degrees. The scale of the model is about half the length of the day, and the position of the two peaks is closely related to the moment of sunrise, which reflects the asymmetry of the two peaks of the ice surface albedo. This study provides a basis for the development of parameterization schemes of diurnal variation of lake ice albedo in semi-arid cold regions.

Infrared spectroscopy tracing of sediment sources in a small rural watershed (French Alps)	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The present article describes a first attempt to use infrared spectroscopy to trace the origin of suspended river sediments. Fifty samples of the main potential sediment sources within a small catchment area (990 ha) in the French Alps were collected and compared with samples of suspended sediment from the river, collected on various dates during 2006 and 2007 using sediment traps. Two major categories of sediment source were identified: topsoils and river channel sediments. For the qualitative part of the study, each of these two main categories was divided into two sub-categories, that is to say, cultivated and pastureland topsoils, and riverbed and riverbank sediments. Discriminant analysis on the source samples showed that Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy can be used to differentiate between the four potential source materials. To determine whether or not immersion in the river altered the infrared spectra of these source materials, we measured the infrared spectra of samples that had been immersed in the river, in litter bags, for periods of up to 24 days. Immersion did not cause any major changes in the infrared spectra. The contribution of each type of source material to the suspended sediment in the river was quantified using partial least squares (PLS) analyses of DRIFT spectra to compare actual river sediment samples with an experimental model. This model was produced from the DRIFT spectra of a range of calibration samples produced by mixing source material samples in different ratios. The predictions of the model were valid and fell within the confidence interval calculated for the calibration set. Comparisons between suspended sediment samples and the model indicate that the predominant source of the sediment is riverbank erosion, which, in this case, is probably due to trampling by cattle.

The setting of this system is rare within the TVZ as it is directly associated with an individual volcanic feature, that of the 1.8 ka Taupo eruption vent. Two distinct hydrothermal vent areas, named Te Hoata and Te Pupu, have been discovered during dives with the submersible Jago. Venting of gases was seen at both sites and hot water (up to 45degreesC) discharges at the Te Pupu site. Dilute water samples have concentrations of SO4, Cl, Na and SiO2 above ambient lake water values. Gas samples have compositions similar to other TVZ geothermal systems. Gas geothermometers indicate the existence of a high-temperature hydrothermal environment beneath the lake with reservoir temperatures in excess of 300degreesC. Chimney structures were found at the Te Pupu site. They are up to 30 cm tall and mineralized by an 'epithermal' suite of elements, including S, Hg, As, Sb and Tl. The walls of the chimneys are largely composed of diatoms and strands of silicified filamentous bacteria embedded in an amorphous silica groundmass. Bacterial mats are commonly associated with the gas vents and also occur at two hot springs. Close to the vents, commonly perched on top of dead chimneys and/or exposed outcrops, are dense assemblages of what are probably a new species of sponge of the genus Heterorotula. The sponges host a notably diversified, associated invertebrate fauna and represent a previously unseen biomass on the lake floor. The sponges appear to have bored into the mineralized chimneys.

Assessments of water clarity in lakes over large temporal and spatial scales, however, are rare, limiting our understanding of its variability and the driven forces. In this study, we developed and validated a robust Secchi disk depth (Z(SD)) algorithm for lakes across China based on two water color parameters, namely Forel-Ule Index (FUI) and hue angle alpha, retrieved from MODIS data. The MODIS Z(SD) model shows good results when compared with in-situ measurements from 17 lakes, with a 27.4% mean relative difference (MRD) in the validation dataset. Compared with other empirical Z(SD) models, our FUI and alpha-based model demonstrates improved performance and adaptability over a wide range of water clarity and trophic states. This algorithm was subsequently applied to MODIS measurements to provide a comprehensive assessment of water clarity in large lakes (N = 153) across China for the first time. The mean summer Z(SD) of the studied lakes between 2000 and 2017 demonstrated marked spatial and temporal variations. Spatially, the Z(SD) of large lakes presented a distinct spatial pattern of "high west and low east" over China. This spatial pattern was found to be associated with the significant differences in lake depth and altitude between west and east China while China's population, GDP, temperature, and precipitation distribution have also contributed to a certain extent. Temporally, the Z(SD) of most lakes increased during this period, with an overall mean rate of 3.3 cm/yr for all lakes. Here, 38.6% (N = 59) of the lakes experienced a significant increase in their Z(SD) value during the past 18 years while only 8.5% (N = 13) showed a significant decreasing trend. Significant increases in lake Z(SD) were observed in west China, which were found to correlate with the increase of air temperature and lake surface area. This is possibly a response of the lakes in west China to climate change. In the lake systems of east China, which are predominately used as a drinking water source, the increase in lake Z(SD) was found to be strongly correlated with changes in local GDP (gross domestic production), NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) and lake surface area, suggesting a combined effect of the implemented management practices and climatic variability. The results of this study provide important information for water quality conservation and management in China, and also highlight the value of satellite remote sensing in monitoring water quality over lakes at a large scale and long-term.					; Zhang, Bing/JOZ-7091-2023; Tyler, Andrew/F-2034-2010; Feng, Lian/JQI-0512-2023; Zhu, Liping/AAC-4284-2022; Wan, Wei/HMU-8460-2023	Zhang, Xianfeng/0000-0002-2475-4558; Spyrakos, Evangelos/0000-0001-7970-5211; li, jun sheng/0000-0002-8590-9736; Feng, Lian/0000-0002-4590-3022; Zhu, Liping/0000-0002-4234-8748													0034-4257	1879-0704				SEP 15	2020	247								111949	10.1016/j.rse.2020.111949	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2020.111949													WOS:000549189200047
J	de Lafontaine, Y; Gagnon, P; Côté, B				de Lafontaine, Yves; Gagnon, Pierre; Cote, Bernard			Abundance and individual size of American eel (Anguilla rostrata) in the St. Lawrence River over the past four decades	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Changes in abundance indicators and the mean size of American eel (Anguilla rostrata LeSueur) in the lower St. Lawrence River (SLR) over the past 40 years were assessed to determine the chronology of the species decline and the possible effect of hydroclimatic factors on that trend. Daily catches at commercial weirs and at an experimental fishery were used to model the long-term trend in silver eel availability. Eel landings started declining in the mid-1980s; whereas the modelled catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) index shows a monotonic declining trend since the late 1960s. Landings and CPUEs were not strongly correlated, and landings cannot be a valid proxy for silver eel abundance in the SLR. Variations in summer river discharge contributed to interannual fluctuations in CPUE by affecting eel availability to the fishing gears. No relationship was found between CPUE and the North Atlantic Oscillation index of climatic variability. Correlations between hydroclimatic variables lagged by 1-20 years and CPUE indices revealed no measurable effect of riverine hydroclimatic variability on eel recruitment. The average size of silver eels increased by 30% between 1997 and 2007, as a result of poor recruitment during the mid-1980s. Since the onset of the silver eel decline preceded the major decline in recruitment in the mid-1980s, we suggest that the decline in spawning stock size was not due to poor recruitment but rather to large-scale mortality factors associated with high exploitation in upstream Lake Ontario and to construction of hydropower dams in the late 1950s.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2010	647	1					185	198		10.1007/s10750-009-9850-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-009-9850-5													WOS:000277241700014
J	Traylor, JJ; Alisauskas, RT; Kehoe, FP				Traylor, JJ; Alisauskas, RT; Kehoe, FP			Nesting ecology of White-winged Scoters (Melanitta fusca deglandi) at Redberry Lake, Saskatchewan	AUK												Population surveys indicate a trend of declining abundance of scoters (Melanitta spp.) in North America. Little is known about changes in life-history traits that may be responsible for the recent population decline of White-winged Scoters (Melanitta fusca deglandi). Therefore, we studied nesting ecology of White-winged Scoters at Redberry Lake, Saskatchewan, during the summers of 2000-2001. We found 198 nests and examined nest-site selection by comparing habitat features of successful nests, depredated nests, and random sites. Discriminant function analysis differentiated habitat features-measured at hatch-of successful nests, deprecated nests, and random sites; lateral (r = 0.66) and overhead (r = 0.35) concealment were microhabitat variables most correlated with canonical discriminant functions. We also modeled daily survival rate of nests as a function of year, linear and quadratic trends with nest age, nest initiation date, and seven microhabitat variables. Nest survival from a time-constant model (i.e. Mayfield nest-success estimate) was 0.35 (95% CL: 0.27, 0.43). Estimates of nest success were lower than those measured at Redberry Lake in the 1970s and 1980s. Nest survival increased throughout the laying period and stabilized during incubation, and showed positive relationships with nest concealment and distance to water and a negative relationship with distance to edge. Considering those factors, a model-averaged estimate of nest survival was 0.24 (95% CL: 0.09, 0.42). We concluded that White-winged Scoters selected nesting habitat adaptively, because (1) successful sites were more concealed than depreciated sites; (2) nest sites (both successful and depredated) had higher concealment than random sites; and (3) nest sites were on islands, where success is greater than on the mainland.

The samples were taken in April, July and September. A total of 1349 specimens belonging to 52 species of water mites were collected. We decided to distingush Lebertia cf. gibbosa despite of its synonymization with L. ineaqualis, because we collected both species and found sound distinguishing features. The status of the species should be rechecked. The most abundant species was Hygrobates setosus (13.4%) followed by Sperchon papillosus (10.5%), S. clupeifer (9.8%), Torrenticola amplexa (8.5%), Hygrobates longipalpis and Limnesia maculata (each 7.0%), Hygrobates calliger (5.8%), Lebertia ineaqualis (5.2%) and Arrenurus albator (4%). The largest synecological group was rheophiles and rheobionts (71.1% specimens) followed by lake species (16.5%), small water bodies species (11.9%), species from astatic waters and crenophilous species (0.2% specimens). The most stagnophilous species were connected with marginal pools with and muddy bottom covered by plants and sections of river after lake or spring. More specimens (894) and species (31) were caught in the lotic zone of the river than in the lentic zone (455 specimens, 28 species). Rheophilous species were divided into two groups: one connected with lotic zones but with rather slow-flowing water and sandy bottom, and another one connected with fast-flowing water with gravel and stones on the bottom, partially covered by mosses.																				2251-8169				JAN 15	2022	11	1					35	49		10.22073/pja.v11i1.71351	http://dx.doi.org/10.22073/pja.v11i1.71351													WOS:000753611700004
J	Li, Y; Zhang, YX				Li, Yu; Zhang, Yuxin			Synergy of the westerly winds and monsoons in the lake evolution of global closed basins since the Last Glacial Maximum and implications for hydrological change in central Asia	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												The monsoon system and westerly circulation, to which climate change responds differently, are two important components of global atmospheric circulation interacting with each other in the middle to low latitudes. Relevant research on global millennial-scale climate change in monsoon and westerly regions is mostly devoted to multi-proxy analyses of lakes, stalagmites, ice cores, and marine and eolian sediments. Different responses from these proxies to long-term environmental change make understanding climate change patterns in monsoon and westerly regions difficult. Accordingly, we disaggregated global closed basins into areas governed by monsoon and westerly winds, unified paleoclimate indicators, and added lake models and paleoclimate simulations to emphatically track millennial-scale evolution characteristics and mechanisms of East Asian summer monsoon and westerly winds since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Our results reveal that millennial-scale water balance change exhibits an obvious boundary between global monsoon and westerly regions in closed basins, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere. The effective moisture in most closed basins of the midlatitude Northern Hemisphere mainly exhibits a decreasing trend since the LGM, while that of the low latitudes shows an increasing trend. In the monsoon-dominated closed basins of Asia, a humid climate prevails in the early to mid-Holocene, and a relatively dry climate appears in the LGM and late Holocene. In the westerly-wind-dominated closed basins of Asia, the climate is characterized by a humid LGM and mid-Holocene (MH) compared with the dry early and late Holocene, which is likely to be connected to precipitation brought by the westerly circulation. This study provides insight into the long-term evolution and synergy of westerly winds and monsoon systems as well as a basis for the projection of future hydrological balance.

Microfloc alum injection	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Moore, B.C., A.C. Richter and D. Christensen 2009. Newman Lake restoration: A case study. Part II. Microfloc alum injection. Lake Reserv. Manage. 25:351-363. Microfloc alum injection, in contrast to whole-lake alum treatments, is a relatively new technique for alum delivery that has been implemented in a relatively small number of lakes and reservoirs. Microfloc alum injection is primarily designed to precipitate phosphorus in the water column using low doses applied on a continuous or intermittent basis. The technique employs diffusers to create ultra-small aluminum hydroxide particles with lower settling velocities and longer residence times, compared to whole lake treatments, to strip dissolved phosphorus from the water column. Because relatively few microfloc systems have been deployed, a brief review of their characteristics and performance is provided. In Newman Lake, Washington, a microfloc alum injection system has been in use since spring 1997. We tested microfloc residence times using in situ enclosures; residence time was determined to be at least 10 days, supporting the underlying concept. In the lake itself, turnover events prior to alum injection consistently produced higher algae growth with accompanying lower Secchi transparency. Since alum injection, post-turnover Secchi depths have all improved. In 18 years with 32 monitored turnover events, this relatively robust dataset consistently indicates the short-term ability of microfloc to improve transparency through algae reduction. Volume-weighted total phosphorus concentrations also have generally declined following alum injection. Adverse biological impacts were not observed in either enclosures or the lake. In the enclosure studies, total zooplankton and cladoceran densities and biomass in treatments were not significantly different from controls. Further applications and study of this promising technology are warranted.

J	Laugaste, R; Reunanen, M				Laugaste, R; Reunanen, M			The composition and density of epiphyton on some macrophyte species in the partly meromictic Lake Verevi	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The epiphyton on 22 macrophyte species was studied in the hypertrophic stratified Lake Verevi mainly in the midsummer of 2000 and 2001. Some material from 1998 and 1999 was used as well. Chlorophyll a (Chl a) level was high: 330-360 mu g g dw(-1) on emergent plants, and an average of 117-200 mu g on floating-leaved plants and 820-920 mu g g dw(-1) on submerged plants. Biomass was 15-23, 5-10 and 35-53 mg g dw(-1) respectively. The richest in epiphyton were submerged plants with densely growing and fine branchlets such as Ranunculus, Ceratophyllum, Myriophyllum, Utricularia, Potainogeton pectinatus L. and P. friesii Rupr. The share of Chl a in biomass was higher in 2001 (2.3%) than in 2000 (1.7%), which can be associated with lower irradiance in summer 2001. Filiform chlorophytes were dominating on most plants; 60% of biomass on submerged, 69% on emergent and 80% on floating-leaved plants; in some cases, the share of filamentous species was 95%. Diatoms formed 29, 12 and 7%, cyanobacteria 8, 16 and 10% of the same ecotopes, respectively. As a rule, the epiphyton was quite sparse on large Potamogeton leaves. Cyanobacteria were more abundant on large Potamogeton and Nuphar leaves, Elodea, on stems of P. natans L., Nuphar and on some emergent plants with a smooth and soft stem surface, as Butomus and Typha. Diatoms played the most important role on some Potamogeton species and in single samples of Ceratophyllum and Ranuneulus. The morphology of plant species appears to be the main factor of epiphyton richness in L. Verevi.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP 15	2005	547						137	150		10.1007/s10750-005-4155-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-005-4155-9													WOS:000232760300013

Biological and ecological traits of so far poorly studied species are revealed.The results provide a basis for future investigations, and demonstrate the potential of Elmidae as water quality indicators in this region. This study presents the first comprehensive investigation of population aspects and ecological traits of water beetles in oligotrophic hydrosystems with tufa formation in southeastern Europe. Diverse lotic habitats (springs, rivers and tufa barriers) were investigated monthly for one year in Plitvice Lakes National Park in Croatia. Elmidae were the most diverse and abundant family, followed by Scirtidae and Hydraenidae. The ecological traits of water beetles were primarily defined by nutrients and water depth. Elmis bosnica Zaitzev, 1908, about which little has been published, was found to be bryophilous and to prefer low water temperatures. Biogeographical analysis revealed the dominance of typical southeastern and Mediterranean species. Species population dynamics could be attributed to differences in flow permanence, current velocity and canopy coverage. Both current velocity and water depth significantly influenced the occurrence of larval stages, while abundance of adults correlated with water depth. Our results highlight tufa barriers as preferred habitats for species of the genus Riolus and the family Scirtidae. The results of this study, many of which are the first to be reported for water beetles, provide a basis for further investigations of these animals and their ecology in oligotrophic hydrosystems with tufa. In particular, our study demonstrates the potential of Elmidae as water quality indicators, which should be considered in future conservation and protection management efforts.

Isoetes sabatina (Isoetaceae, Lycopodiopsida): Taxonomic distinctness and preliminary ecological insights	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												Isoetes sabatina is the rarest aquatic quillwort in Europe. Although recently found (2013) in Lake Bracciano (central Italy), the species is just one step away from extinction with an estimated population not exceeding 400 individuals and a spatial range of a few hundred square metres. Lake Bracciano is a deep, oligo-mesotrophic Mediterranean volcanic lake that has been subjected to human activities. From January to October 2017, the lake experienced a dramatic water level decrease (up to -1.50 m), which significantly affected the littoral zone and the habitat of I. sabatina. To improve the chances of survival of I. sabatina, the first eco-taxonomic investigation on this species was carried out to describe its genetic distinctness, physical and chemical requirements and companion species. The phylogenetic position of I. sabatina was investigated by applying standard DNA barcoding methods. Simultaneously, during summer 2019, the physical and chemical features of water and sediments of the I. sabatina population and five small Alpine lakes colonized by Isoetes echinospora - a supposed close relative - were characterized. These data were then compared with the available data on the trophic requirements of the target obligate aquatic Isoetes, together with Isoetes lacustris and Isoetes malinverniana. The present survey confirmed the taxonomic and ecological distinctness of I. sabatina - providing the first evidence of genetic differentiation from I. echinospora. Isoetes sabatina grows in waters with temperature, conductivity and total alkalinity up to 30 degrees C, 561 mu S cm(-1) and 3.45 meq L-1, respectively. The edaphic requirements of I. sabatina confirm its outstanding conservation value, and this study offers a basic understanding of how to prevent its extinction. Now, all possible actions must be taken immediately to save this species.

Spatial Scale and Field Management Affect Patterns of Phosphorus Loss in Cranberry Floodwaters	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Although cranberries (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.) are indigenous to the northeastern United States, phosphorus (P) fertilizer additions and periodic flooding make commercial cranberry a potential source of P to the region's lakes and streams. In this study, we report values of P export in cranberry floodwaters that range from < 0.8 to 4.7 kg P ha(-1), generally reflecting differences in the hydrological, edaphic, and management factors underlying soil P transfer to floodwater. The relatively high P loading rate (4.7 P kg P ha(-1)) was associated with harvest flooding of organic-rich soils. Periods of winter flooding and the discharge of harvest floodwater from mineral soils resulted in relatively low P loss (< 0.8 kg P ha(-1)). Increases in concentrations of total dissolved P (DP) and total particulate P (PP) in floodwater as stage decreased below the surface of the cranberry bed were consistent with the transport of dissolved P in soil porewater and mobilization of particulate P in ditches. Variations in floodwater DP, as well as conservative and reactive tracer concentrations, suggested that the processes by which soil P is released to porewater included desorption of near-surface soil P and anaerobic dissolution of iron-P compounds deeper in the soil profile. At the farm scale, concentrations of DP and PP steadily increased over time, presumably because drainage waters from beds farther upgradient had longer contact times with P-rich sources, such as soil porewater and ditch sediments. Overall, the study illustrates the role that scale-dependent processes impart on patterns of P loss in agricultural production systems.

In China, shale-gas geological resources are estimated as approximately 110 x 10(12) m(3), with recoverable gas reserves of ca. 20 x 10(12) m(3). Recoverable shale-oil reserves are estimated as ca. 5 x 10(9) t. A total 35 important organic-matter-rich shale units have been recognized from Mesoproterozoic to Cenozoic strata across the entire China. These shales are categorized according to their origin under marine, marine-nonmarine transitional and lacustrine conditions. Shales of marine origin, with ca. 9 x 10(12) m(3) recoverable resources, dominate China's potential in terms of total volume of organic-carbon. Currently, the most favorable marine shales for oil and gas exploration are found in the Sichuan Basin within the lower Cambrian Qiongzhusi Formation and in the Wufeng-Longmaxi formations of uppermost Ordovician through lower Silurian. A fortuitous combination of of sea-level variations, of paleo-productivity, of tectonic activity causing development and migration of partially closed deep basin depocenters, and of sediment accumulation rates controlled the extensive deposition and distribution of organic-matter-rich shales in these Wufeng and Longmaxi formations. Organic-matter-rich shales in marine-nonmarine transitional facies associated with coal measures occur in North China within the Carboniferous and Permian, and in South China within the Permian. These Carboniferous Permian organic-matter-rich shales are important source rocks for the gas fields in the Ordos and Sichuan Basins. Abundant organic-rich shales are also widely distributed within coal-bearing elastics and coal-measure shales of fluvial, lacustrine, and swamp facies in Upper Triassic to Middle Jurassic successions of many basins. Lacustrine organic-rich shales were deposited during the Permian through Neogene in various freshwater to saline lake settings. Lacustrine organic-matter-rich shales are the main oil source rocks in the Songliao, Bohai Bay, Ordos and Junggar basins. Lacustrine algae contributed to the rain of organic matter; and the preservation of organic matter and distribution of organic-rich shale was controlled by lake currents, water depth and oxygen-poor conditions, with enhanced preservation when buried by turbidity currents. Algal blooms were partly induced by trace nutrients from volcanic ash falls in all of these lacustrine basins. Seawater intrusion into the freshwater lake of the Songliao Basin promoted some episodes of black shales. Saline lacustrine basins, such as middle Permian Junggar Basin, contain organic-rich dolomite mudstone that mainly formed during hot climate conditions when the lakes had high salinity and stratified water columns that deprived the bottom waters of oxygen, thereby preserving massive amounts of organic matter. Laminated calcite-rich mudstone in the saline lacustrine settings formed in more brackish waters under stable warm conditions and weak biological activity. The modeling of the factors controlling the distribution of organic-matter-rich shales within China's basins is important for the exploration and development of unconventional oil and gas resources.

Growth Performance of the Freshwater Mussel, Unio terminalis delicates (Lea, 1863) (Mollusca: Bivalvia: Unionidae) in the Golbasi Lake, Turkey	PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												In this study, the effects of four different stocking densities (20, 40, 60, 80 individuals/m(2)) were investigated on growth performance of the Unio terminalis delicates in a natural lake (Lake Golbasi, Kinkhan, Hatay, Turkey). Growth in live weight, shell length, width and height were measured monthly for the four different stock groups during 6 months. The highest growth rate was obtained from 40 ind./m(2)group, while the best condition factor was acquired from the lowest density group (20 ind./m(2)). The specific growth rate for length and weight were highest in June and July in all groups. On the other hand, plankton biodiversity, chlorophyll a, Mg, NO2, NO3, amount of organic matters, NH3, PO4, Si, Ca and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were determined as biological and chemical characteristics. At the end of the study, the greatest live weight (5.06+/-0.34 g) was obtained from 40 ind./m(2), with 3.34+/-0.05 cm, 1.36+/-0.03 cm and 1.91+/-0.04 cm as length, width and height values, respectively. Therefore, it could be advised that juveniles should be stocked in early spring for U. terminalis delicates at a level of 40 ind./m(2). This results suggest that stocking density is the key factor in mussels culture and important for captive breeding in mussels production.

However, the long-term monitoring of thermokarst disturbances and their next development remains a challenge across the circumpolar permafrost regions. Here, we calculate six spectral indices from Landsat images to represent greenness, wetness, and brightness, quantifying the spatiotemporal characteristics of thermokarst landscape dynamics and further revealing their development with a warming climate. Additionally, DNMI, NDWI, and NDVI are selected to verify the occurrence and severity of retrogressive thaw slumps, thermokarst lake expansion, and drainage by the LandTrendr algorithm on the Google Earth Engine platform. Three major types of thermokarst events show a consistent disturbance year, correlating with the summer temperature increase point around 2000. Their correlation analysis also reveals that the subsequent landscape development of thermokarst disturbances is related to the warming context, showing vegetation greening and soil wetting trends. These findings highlight the dynamic characteristics of thermokarst disturbances from 1990 to 2023, providing a comprehensive understanding of thermokarst development under a changing climate.

J	Gao, Z; Hu, X; Li, XY; Li, ZC				Gao, Zhou; Hu, Xia; Li, Xiao-Yan; Li, Zong-Chao			Effects of freeze-thaw cycles on soil macropores and its implications on formation of hummocks in alpine meadows in the Qinghai Lake watershed, northeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau	JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS												Purpose The alpine regions are characterized by frequent freeze-thaw cycles, which influence the soil structure remarkably. However, the effects of freeze-thaw cycles on the soil macropore structure and its implications on the formation of hummocks are not well understood. This study aims to quantify the soil macropores of hummocks and the effects of freeze-thaw cycles on soil macropores to reveal its implications on the formation of hummocks in alpine meadows. Materials and methods A total of nine intact soil columns (0-50 cm deep) were excavated from the alpine meadows. Three replicates were collected from the hummocks and three were collected from the interhummocks, and they were scanned by X-ray computed tomography (CT). Another three replicates were excavated from the adjacent non-hummock alpine meadows, which were subjected to successive freeze-thaw cycles (0, 1, 3, and 6) and then scanned using X-ray CT. Results and discussion Soil macropore network of hummocks was more extensive and continuous than that of the interhummocks. The volumetric distribution of soil macropores in hummocks was multiple, while soil macropores of the interhummocks intensively fell in the volume range of 0-400 mm(3). The soil macroporosity, macropore number density, surface area density, length density, node density, branch density, and mean macropore size of the hummocks were several times higher than those of the interhummocks. These soil macropore parameters showed a decrease after the first and third freeze-thaw cycle and later increased through the next three cycles. Soil macropores with volume > 1000 mm(3)transformed into smaller ones (600-1000 mm(3)) during the freeze-thaw process. Conclusions The soil macropore patterns of hummocks and interhummocks differed distinctly. Soil macropores responded significantly to freeze-thaw cycles. The effects of freeze-thaw cycles on the macropore number and size were more significant than on the morphology in alpine meadows. Hummock formation is closely related to the soil macropores during the freeze-thaw cycles, and the soil moisture played a crucial role in the hummock formation process.					; hu, ongxia/GQP-8544-2022; Li, Xiaoyan/K-8544-2012	Li, XiaoYan/0000-0002-7454-7821; 													1439-0108	1614-7480				JAN	2021	21	1					245	256		10.1007/s11368-020-02765-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-020-02765-2		AUG 2020											WOS:000564215000001
J	Lienesch, PW; Gophen, M				Lienesch, PW; Gophen, M			Size-selective predation by inland silversides on an exotic cladoceran, Daphnia lumholtzi	SOUTHWESTERN NATURALIST												The helmet and large spines of zooplankton inhibit predation by small fishes. Daphnia lumholtzi, a long-spined, helmeted cladoceran, has recently invaded Lake Texoma (Oklahoma-Texas) and much of southeastern North America. To determine if inland silversides (Menidia beryllina) were size-selective predators oil D. lumholtzi, we conducted laboratory experiments using 3 size-classes of fish (22 to 35 mm, 46 to 60 mm, and 67 to 80 mm). Inland silversides were allowed to feed for 80 min on D. lumholtzi of various sizes. Prey selection differed among the 3 silverside size-classes. Small inland silversides ate more small D. lumholtzi (total length 0.99 to 1.75 mm) than did large and medium inland silversides. Large inland silversides ate more large (2.62 to 3.44 mm) and very large (3.5 to 5.25 mm) D. lumholtzi than did smaller inland silversides. To examine if these trends occur in nature, we compared the lengths of D. lumholtzi and native Daphnia species (D. parvula and D. galeata) eaten by large and small inland silversides collected from Lake Texoma. As in the laboratory experiment, small inland silversides ate smaller D. lumholtzi than did large inland silversides. Although small inland silversides ate smaller D. lumholtzi, D. lumholtzi might be an important food source for young-of-the-year inland silversides, because D. lumholtzi reaches peak abundances during summer when native daphnid densities are low in Lake Texoma.																			0038-4909	1943-6262				JUN	2005	50	2					158	165		10.1894/0038-4909(2005)050[0158:SPBISO]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1894/0038-4909(2005)050[0158:SPBISO]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000230150600003

We analyzed the elemental concentrations and zinc stable isotope ratios (delta Zn-66) in a sediment core from the Northern basin of the lake. The goals were 1) to reconstruct the historical trend of trace metals in the lake and 2) to understand whether the range of Zn concentrations was derived from natural or anthropogenic sources. The first increase in Cu and Zn concentrations from the late 1910s until approximately 1940 could be due to human-induced higher contributions from the surrounding mafic igneous rocks. A second increase in the Zn concentrations accompanied by a slight decrease in the delta Zn-66 values from the late 1950s coincided with the period of the industrialization and urbanization. The delta Zn-66 values fell in a binary mixing process between a lithogenic (similar to+0.28 parts per thousand) and an anthropogenic endmember (similar to+0.14 parts per thousand). Although industrial effluents were strictly regulated by law from the late 1960s, constant Zn concentrations throughout the 1980s indicated contributions from domestic wastewaters and diffusive sources such as runoff from paddy fields, roads, and industrial areas. Zinc, Ni, and Co were still enriched in recent surface sediment compared to the pre-industrial times. The metal fractions obtained by the BCR sequential extraction procedure showed that Pb was mainly hosted in the reducible fraction, and Cu and Zn were mainly hosted in the residual fraction. The increasing trace metal concentrations in the acid-labile and reducible fractions towards the surface indicate these fractions were the primary host for anthropogenic trace metals. We conclude it is unlikely that the natural condition of the lake sediment will be recovered owing to the continuing urbanization around Lake Biwa.					; Suzuki, Katsuhiko/B-1143-2018; Nitzsche, Kai/GPP-6241-2022; Ohkouchi, Naohiko/B-2071-2008; Ogawa, Nanako/AAJ-6456-2020; Ishikawa, Naoto/C-2986-2012	OGAWA, Nanako O/0000-0002-3823-6444; Suzuki, Katsuhiko/0000-0003-4266-5046; Nitzsche, Kai/0000-0003-4937-7039; Ishikawa, Naoto/0000-0002-8268-9512													0883-2927	1872-9134				NOV	2021	134								105107	10.1016/j.apgeochem.2021.105107	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2021.105107		OCT 2021											WOS:000708125000001
J	Leblanc, JP; Weller, JD; Chow-Fraser, P				Leblanc, John Paul; Weller, J. Daniel; Chow-Fraser, Patricia			Thirty-year update: Changes in biological characteristics of degraded muskellunge nursery habitat in southern Georgian Bay, Lake Huron, Canada	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Aquatic vegetation is a critical component of nursery habitat for young-of-the-year (YOY) muskellunge. The trophy status of the muskellunge fishery in southeastern Georgian Bay owes its reputation to the widespread distribution of aquatic vegetation in coastal marshes of this region. Unfortunately, wetland habitat has been in decline because of an unprecedented period of sustained low water levels since 1999. In this study, we strategically re-sampled 16 historic sites that supported YOY muskellunge in 1981. The sustained low water levels and increased shoreline modifications experienced by southeastern Georgian Bay may have contributed to the current disappearance of YOY muskellunge at those sites. These physical stressors appeared to have altered the habitat structure of the plant community and led to changes in fish communities, making them no longer suitable for YOY muskellunge. The precise mechanisms limiting survival to the YOY stage are unknown because spawning adults have been observed in the area in the spring of 2012 and 2013. These results corroborated previous sampling programs at the historic sites (2004-2005: n = 8 and 2007: n = 16) that employed other fishing gears and protocols as well as a supplemental YOY sampling in 2013 (n = 26 additional sites). If this muskellunge population is to remain self-sustaining, a complementary management strategy specifically developed for Georgian Bay is required. The strategy should identify and ultimately protect suitable muskellunge breeding habitat by accounting for the unique geomorphology, current physical stressors affecting Georgian Bay, and the biological links between suitable spawning and nursery habitats.

However, it is still unclear to what extent the distribution patterns of these microorganisms are affected by the freshwater sediment across a large geographical scale. This study was designed to gain insight into the heterogeneity distribution of AOA and AOB in freshwater sediments from the macrophyte or algae dominated regions. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) combined with the terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) were employed to characterize the abundance, diversity, and community structure of the AOA and AOB across eight freshwater lakes in sediments from Jiangsu of China. AOA and AOB were ubiquitous in all sediments, and archaeal amoA far outnumbered bacterial amoA in sediments with the lower concentration of organic matters. The abundance of AOA and AOB did not vary with the freshwater ecological type (macrophyte dominated region and algae dominated region). Based on the T-RFLP of an amoA gene, this research found that the concentration of organic matters in pore water rather than other factors affect the AOA community structure in sediments, while the AOB were not significantly different in the freshwater sediments. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all archaeal amoA sequences fell within either the Crenarchaeotal Group (CG) I.1b or the CGI.1a subgroup, and all AOB clustered with genus Nitrosomonas or Nitrosospira. The data obtained in this study elucidates the role of ammonia-oxidizing archaea and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria in the nitrogen cycle of freshwater ecosystems.

The mountainous region of Inner Asia comprises various steppe, meadow, and forest landscapes where zooarchaeological evidence suggests occupation by herding populations as early as 7,000 years Before Present (BP). Recent archaeobotanical findings indicate the introduction of cropping and the development of agropastoralism around 4,500 BP. Here, we review and synthesize palaeoenvironmental studies and data to examine anthropogenic impacts and modifications of these landscapes. From around 4,000 BP, we find significant changes in palynomorph, charcoal, sediment, and other proxy data, related to the introduction of agriculture to the region, with later intensifications in land use indicators at around 2,000 and 1,000 BP. We note that these impacts are not uniform or continuous through and across the records and may be evidence of shifting phases of occupation and landscape management. This temporal and spatial variability may also be a response to shifts in moisture availability due to long-term Holocene changes in the intensity of the summer monsoon and Westerly circulation systems. Changes in arboreal pollen indicate the development of intensified use of forest resources in the region, which we identify as a topic for future investigation. Based on these data, we stress the long-term human paleoecology in the study area and argue that traditional agropastoralist systems should be considered in future programs of landscape conservation in the region. This study also emphasizes the importance of future local scale multiproxy studies into past anthropogenic changes within the Inner Asian landscape.					spate, michael/HGC-2838-2022; Motuzaite Matuzeviciute, Giedre/AAK-2928-2021														2296-701X					JUL 18	2022	10								939374	10.3389/fevo.2022.939374	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2022.939374													WOS:000838200200001

Climatic variability during the last millennium in Western Iceland from lake sediment records	HOLOCENE												The aim of this research was to create a decadal-scale terrestrial quantitative palaeoclimate record for NW Iceland from lake sediments for the last millennium. Geochemical, stable isotope and chironomid reconstructions were obtained from a lake sequence constrained by tephra deposits on the Snaefellsnes peninsula, western Iceland. Obtaining a quantitative record proved problematic, but the qualitative chironomid record showed clear trends associated with past summer temperatures, and the sedimentological records provided evidence for past changes in precipitation, mediated through catchment soil in-wash. When the full range of chronological uncertainty is considered, four clear phases of climatic conditions were identified: (1) a relatively warm phase between AD 1020 and 1310; (2) a relatively stable period between AD 1310 and 1510, cooler than the preceding period but still notably warmer than the second half of the millennium; (3) a consistent reduction of temperatures between AD 1560 and 1810, with the coolest period between AD 1680 and 1810; and (4) AD 1840-2000 has temperatures mainly warmer than in the preceding two centuries, with a rising trend and increased variability from c. AD 1900 onwards. The reconstructions show clearly that the first half of the millennium experienced warmer climatic conditions than the second half, with a return to the warmer climate only occurring in the last c. 100 years. Much of the variability of the chironomid record can be linked to changes in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The reconstructions presented can track low-frequency and long-term trends effectively and consistently but high-resolution and calibrated quantitative records remain more of a challenge - not just in finding optimal sedimentary deposits but also in finding the most reliable proxy. It is this that presents the real challenge for Holocene climate reconstruction from this key area of the North Atlantic.

Evaluating diatom community composition in the absence of marked limnological gradients in the high Arctic: a surface sediment calibration set from Cornwallis Island (Nunavut, Canada)	POLAR BIOLOGY												Fossil diatom assemblages preserved within the sedimentary record in Arctic lakes provide the potential to reconstruct past changes in important limnological variables. During the summers of 1992 and 1993, we examined previously unstudied freshwater ecosystems on Cornwallis Island, Arctic Canada, with the specific objectives of (1) documenting the limnology and modern diatom assemblages from this region, and (2) determining which environmental variables most influence diatom species distributions. The Cornwallis Island study sites displayed the least amount of variance in measured water chemistry variables in comparison to nearly all of our labs' previous freshwater surveys in the Arctic. The small limnological gradients precluded the development of a statistically robust diatom inference model, but perhaps more importantly, allowed us to explore variations in diatom composition in the absence of marked variations in water chemistry. Diatom species turnover was minimal, with the most common diatom taxa being Achnanthidium minutissima, Nitzschia perminuta, N. frustulum, with lesser percent abundances of Chaemaepinnularia soehrensis, Navicula chiarae, Psammothidium marginulata, and A. kryophila. A small number of study sites differed from the majority with respect to water chemistry (e.g., coastal sites with high specific conductivities) and habitat availability (e.g., ephemeral ponds with extensive moss habitats), and these sites had markedly different diatom assemblages. These data reinforce previous observations that water chemistry and other climate-related factors are the primary environmental controls influencing diatom distributions at high latitudes.					; Smol, John/A-8838-2015	Smol, John/0000-0002-2499-6696; 													0722-4060	1432-2056				OCT	2007	30	11					1459	1473		10.1007/s00300-007-0307-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00300-007-0307-x													WOS:000249306800010

ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY					5th International Conference on Toxic Cyanoacteria	JUL 15-20, 2001	NOOSA, AUSTRALIA					Due to the increasing oligotrophy of Lake Ammersee, southern Germany, metalimnic Planktothrix have become one of the dominant planktonic species causing regular blooms. Whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) is the dominant local fish species with great importance for the fishing industry. Recently, whole age groups of this fish species have disappeared and since 1991, average body-weight has decreased. The causes for this remain unclear. Planktothrix species produce the cyclic peptide toxin desmethyl microcystin-RR, which inhibits glycogen metabolism and has detrimental effects on the development of aquatic organisms. During blooms, gut contents of whitefish displayed a blue discoloration, possibly representing phycobiliproteins typical for cyanobacteria. This study aimed to elucidate the impact of Planktothrix blooms on fish population dynamics. Planktothrix cell counts, performed by epifluorescence microscopy, showed blooms to contain up to 80,000 cells/ml. Microcystin levels of 1-5 mug/mg dry weight in Planktothrix extracts and 0.08 mug/l in water samples, were determined via HPLC and protein-phosphatase inhibition assay. Planktothrix filaments were detected in gut contents of whitefish. In addition, microcystins could be detected in gut contents via ELISA. Similarly, immunoprobing with microcystin-antibodies demonstrated microcystin-protein adducts in liver homogenates of whitefish caught during Planktothrix blooms. Furthermore, Planktothrix extracts proved cytotoxic to trout hepatocytes as determined by MTT reduction. Whitefish eggs and larvae, obtained during blooms in winter 1998 and 2000 in a Lake Ammersee hatchery, were studied for developmental progress. Malformations typical for cyanobacterial toxin exposure were observed. (C) 2001 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

As solid phase material, a new chelating resin, poly N-(4-bromophenyl)-2-methacrylamide-co-2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid-co-divinylbenzene was synthesized. Cr(III) was separated from Cr(VI) and preconcentrated by using a column containing chelating resin. Total chromium was determined after the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) by hydroxylamine hydrochloride as a reducing agent. Then Cr(VI) was calculated by substracting Cr(III) concentration from the total chromium concentration. The parameters such as the effect of H, eluent type, volume and concentration, (low rate of sample solution, sample volume and effect of interfering ions for the preconcentration of Cr(III) were investigated. The optimum pH was found to be 2. Eluent for quantitative elution was 10 ml. of 1 mol L(-1) HCI. The preconcentration factor of the method was 100. At the optimum conditions determined experimentally, the recovery for Cr(III) was found to be 95 +/- 3%. The limit of detection (3s/b) of the method was 1.58 mu g L(-1). In order to determine the adsorption behaviour of chelating resin, the adsorption isotherm of Cr(III) was studied. Adsorption capacity and binding equilibrium constant were calculated to be 21.8 mg g(-1) and 1.32 x 10(-2) L mg(-1), respectively. The method was validated by analysing certified reference material (TMDA-54.4 a trace element fortified calibration standard). The proposed method was applied to the determination and speciation of chromium in tap water, lake water, spring water and wastewater samples with satisfactory results. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Co-occurrence of in-stream nitrogen fixation and denitrification across a nitrogen gradient in a western US watershed	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												It is frequently assumed that nitrogen (N-2) fixation and denitrification do not co-occur in streams because each process should be favored under different concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), and therefore these processes are rarely quantified together. We asked if these processes could co-exist by conducting a spatial survey of N-2 fixation using acetylene reduction and denitrification using acetylene block [with and without amendments of carbon (C) as glucose and nitrogen (N) as nitrate]. Rates were measured on rocks and sediment in 8 southeastern Idaho streams encompassing a DIN gradient of 26-615 A mu g L-1. Sampling at each site was repeated in summer 2015 and 2016. We found that both denitrification and N-2 fixation occurred across the gradient of DIN concentrations, with N-2 fixation occurring primarily on rocks and denitrification occurring in sediment. N-2 fixation rates on rocks significantly decreased 100x across the DIN gradient in 1 year of the study, and amended (with N and C) denitrification rates increased 10x across the DIN gradient in both years. Multiple linear regression and partial least squares models with environmental characteristics measured at the scale of entire stream reaches showed that C and phosphorus were positive predictors of amended and unamended denitrification rates, but no significant model could explain N-2 fixation rates across all streams and years. This, coupled with the observation that detectable rates of N-2 fixation occurred primarily on rocks and denitrification occurred primarily on sediment, suggests that microhabitat scale factors may better predict the co-occurrence of these processes within stream reaches. Overlooking the potential co-occurrence of N-2 fixation and denitrification in stream ecosystems will impede understanding by oversimplifying the contribution of each process to the N cycle.

Maintaining native species and characteristic processes requires this successional diversity, but methods to achieve it are poorly explained in the literature. In the Inland Pacific US, large, old, early seral trees were a key historical feature of many young and old forest successional patches, especially where fires frequently occurred. Large, old trees are naturally fire-tolerant, but today are often threatened by dense understory cohorts that create fuel ladders that alter likely post-fire successional pathways. Reducing these understories can contribute to resistance by creating conditions where canopy trees will survive disturbances and climatic stressors; these survivors are important seed sources, soil protectors, and critical habitat elements. Historical timber harvesting has skewed tree size and age class distributions, created hard edges, and altered native patch sizes. Manipulating these altered forests to promote development of larger patches of older, larger, and more widely-spaced trees with diverse understories will increase landscape resistance to severe fires, and enhance wildlife habitat for underrepresented conditions. Closed-canopy, multi-layered patches that develop in hot, dry summer environments are vulnerable to droughts, and they increase landscape vulnerability to insect outbreaks and severe wildfires. These same patches provide habitat for species such as the northern spotted owl, which has benefited from increased habitat area. Regional and local planning will be critical for gauging risks, evaluating trade-offs, and restoring dynamics that can support these and other species. The goal will be to manage for heterogeneous landscapes that include variably-sized patches of (1) young, middle-aged, and old, closed canopy forests growing in upper montane, northerly aspect, and valley bottom settings, (2) a similar diversity of open-canopy, fire-tolerant patches growing on ridgetops, southerly aspects, and lower montane settings, and (3) significant montane chaparral and grassland areas. Tools to achieve this goal include managed wildfire, prescribed burning, and variable density thinning at small to large scales. Specifics on "how much and where?" will vary according to physiographic, topographic and historical templates, and regulatory requirements, and be determined by means of a socio-ecological process.

Ostracod-based reconstruction of Late Quaternary lake level changes within the Tangra Yumco lake system (southern Tibetan Plateau)	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												Tangra Yumco, a large saline lake located in the central-southern part of the Tibetan Plateau, lies in a hydrologically closed basin and is part of a cascade lake system including Tangqung Co, Tangra Yumco and Xuru Co. The extension and position of this lake system makes it valuable for reconstructing palaeoclimatic variations through the lake history and to compare both with the adjacent lake systems. We reconstructed Late Quaternary lake level changes based on data from two lacustrine sediment cores. A micropalaeontological analysis focusing on Ostracoda was carried out combined with dating (C-14, Pb-210, Cs-137), sedimentology and stable isotope data from bulk sediment. Ostracod analysis involves the quantitative documentation of associations. An ostracod-based transfer function for specific conductivity was applied to assess and refine lake level changes and to compare the results with other lake level reconstructions from the Tibetan Plateau for evaluating inter-regional climatic patterns. Seven ostracod species were detected, with Leucocytherella sinensis dominating the associations followed by Leucocythere? dorsotuberosa, Limnocythere inopinata and Tonnacypris gyirongensis. Fabaeformiscandona gyirongensis, Candona candida and Candona xizangensis were found in only a few samples and at low percentages. The synthesis of ostracod-based environmental reconstruction and chronology for samples from Tangra Yumco reveals the evolution of the lake system during the past 17ka. A low lake level around 17calkaBP is followed by a recovering until the reaching of a high stand around 8-9calkaBP. Subsequently, between 7.7 and 2.5calkaBP, it remained relatively stable with a subsequent short-living lowstand-highstand cycle at around 2ka. Thereafter, the ostracod-based conductivity transfer function shows an increase of conductivity corresponding to a lake level rising phase at around 0.4ka. The recorded changes are indicators of past climatic conditions and refine the palaeoclimatic models in this area.

Alkenone-based reconstructions reveal four-phase Holocene temperature evolution for High Arctic Svalbard	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Situated at the crossroads of major oceanic and atmospheric circulation patterns, the Arctic is a key component of Earth's climate system. Compounded by sea-ice feedbacks, even modest shifts in the region's heat budget drive large climate responses. This is highlighted by the observed amplified response of the Arctic to global warming. Assessing the imprint and signature of underlying forcing mechanisms require paleoclimate records, allowing us to expand our knowledge beyond the short instrumental period and contextualize ongoing warming. However, such datasets are scarce and sparse in the Arctic, limiting our ability to address these issues. Here, we present two quantitative Holocene-length paleo-temperature records from the High Arctic Svalbard archipelago, situated in the climatically sensitive Arctic North Atlantic. Temperature estimates are based on U-37(K) unsaturation ratios from sediment cores of two lakes. Our data reveal a dynamic Holocene temperature evolution, with reconstructed summer lake water temperatures spanning a range of similar to 6-8 degrees C, and characterized by four phases. The Early Holocene was marked by an early onset (similar to 10.5 ka cal. BP) of insolation-driven Hypsithermal conditions, likely compounded by strengthening oceanic heat transport. This warm interval was interrupted by cooling between similar to 10.5-8.3 ka cal. BP that we attribute to cooling effects from the melting Northern Hemisphere ice sheets. Temperatures declined throughout the Middle Holocene, following a gradual trend that was accentuated by two cooling steps between similar to 7.8-7 ka cal. BP and around similar to 4.4-4.3 ka cal. BP. These transitions coincide with a strengthening influence of Arctic water and sea-ice in the adjacent Fram Strait. During the Late Holocene (past 4 ka), temperature change decoupled from the still-declining insolation, and fluctuated around comparatively cold mean conditions. By showing that Holocene Svalbard temperatures were governed by an alternation of forcings, this study improves our understanding of Arctic climate dynamics. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Wang, GX; Tuo, WQ; Du, MY				Wang, GX; Tuo, WQ; Du, MY			Flux and composition of wind-eroded dust from different landscapes of an arid inland river basin in north-western China	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Using a simple aeolian dust sampler, dust plumes generated from five landscape types (dry lakebed, gobi, farmland, seriously degraded grassland and sandy desert lands) in the inland basin of the Heihe River of north-western China, were monitored, along with wind velocity and temperature, from 2 April to 30 May 2001. Dust fluxes, conditions under which they occurred and an elemental analysis (Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, Fe) of the aeolian dust were completed. While one might have expected the sandy desert land to contribute the greatest quantity of aeolian dust, it was the dried terminal lakebed and degraded grasslands, with April dust productions of 29.37 and 23.54 g d(-1), respectively, which outproduced other landscapes by 10-16-fold. The chemical composition of dust differed according to the location of sampling within the Heihe basin, with lower Si and Al, and higher Mg, Na, Cl and S contents occurring in the lower reaches due to presence of high-salt lake sediments. In the spring, under the prevailing conditions of low soil moisture contents, daily mean wind velocities over 4.0 m s(-1), maximum wind velocities over 12.0 m s(-1), and daily maximum air temperatures of over 15 degreesC, almost any landscape can produce aeolian dust. Indeed, this is when the majority of dust storms occur in the arid region. Protecting grasslands in the lower reaches of the Heihe River basin from degradation and rehabilitating the dried-up terminal lake would do much to reduce aeolian losses in the region.

Chironomid fauna of the lakes from the Pechora river basin (east of European part of Russian Arctic): Ecology and reconstruction of recent ecological changes in the region	CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY												We investigated chironomid fauna of surface sediments and a short sediment core (Bol'shoy Kharbey Lake) from Pechora river basin, Northern Russia. Twenty three investigated lakes have thermokarst, glacial or floodplain origin and are characterised by low mineralization, mostly hydrocarbon-calcium type of water and low concentration of nutrients. Most of the lakes have circumneutral pH around <= 7 and only two lakes are slightly more acidic with pH <= 6. Ninety six chironomid taxa were identified in the surface sediments. Distribution of chironomids in the studied region is driven by continentality, mean T-July and NEuroDe. Chironomid communities from the core of the B. Kharbei Lake demonstrate the highest similarity with the fauna of the deeper lakes of the glacial origin. The glacial lakes have the highest indices of continentality and the lowest winter temperatures within the investigated data set. The chironomid fauna of the glacial lakes is composed of the profundal, oligotrophic and cold-stenotherm taxa. The fauna of the floodplain and thermokarst lakes is more closely related to T-July and is composed of littoral and phytophilic taxa of meso-or eutrophic waters and moderate temperature conditions. The fauna of the acidic thermokarst lakes considerably differs from the other lakes. Chironomid communities here are represented by tolerant to acidification taxa, and by the typically littoral and shallow water acid-tolerant taxa that apparently also can tolerate acidification. Studied sediment record covers ca last 200 years. The reconstructed T-July during the entire period remain slightly below the modern temperatures. From 1970 reconstructed T-July shows steady increase to the modern level. The reconstructed water depths (WDs) of the lake are higher than today till 1980. The highest WDs are reconstructed for ca 1970. After that the WDs gradually decrease to the modern level. Changes of the WDs are most probably related to changes in the precipitation rate.

J	Rosenberg, SA; Walker, IR; Mathewes, RW; Hallett, DJ				Rosenberg, SA; Walker, IR; Mathewes, RW; Hallett, DJ			Midge-inferred Holocene climate history of two subalpine lakes in southern British Columbia, Canada	HOLOCENE												To investigate postglacial environmental changes in both the coastal and interior wet belts of British Columbia, fossil midges were analysed from two subalpine lakes, one adjacent to the lower Fraser canyon (Frozen Lake), and the other in Mount Revelstoke National Park (Eagle Lake). The midge stratigraphy for Frozen Lake revealed an abundance of rheophilous chironomid taxa and Simuliidae larvae, reflecting the presence of an inflowing stream. An abundance of Chaoborus mandibles and Microtendipes during the early Holocene (c. 10 100-7700 C-14 years BP, c. 11500-8500 cal. years BP) suggests warmer temperatures. A subsequent decline in the warm indicators and relative increases in cold stenotherms (Heterotrissocladius and Diamesa) indicate cooling until present day. This climate reconstruction is consistent with other quantitative and qualitative evidence for past climatic change in southern British Columbia. At Eagle Lake the warm indicators, Dicrot-endipes and Polypedilum, are seen in the early Holocene (c. 8500-6730 C-14 years BP, c. 9600-7600 cal. years BP), but are absent during the mid-Holocene when cooler temperatures probably prevailed. In the late Holocene (c. 3800 C-14 years BP to present, c. 4200 cal. years BP to present) there is a resurgence of warm indicators, which contrasts with the evidence of continued cooling typically seen in reconstructions of southern British Columbia summer temperatures. The Eagle Lake record therefore appears to be anomalous. Multiproxy and multisite investigations are needed to reconstruct Holocene climatic changes more reliably.					; Hallett, Douglas/G-4968-2011	MATHEWES, ROLF/0000-0001-7637-199X; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				MAR	2004	14	2					258	271		10.1191/0959683604hl703rp	http://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683604hl703rp													WOS:000221328100011

Results from three experiments, performed in Lake Erken in August 1992, July 1993, and July 1994, are presented. Inorganic nutrients were added to enclosures in order to increase concentrations of phosphate (1992: 15 mu g P/l, 1993 and 1994: 20 mu g P/l), and either ammonium or nitrate (1992: 150 mu g N/l, 1993 and 1994: 200 mu g N/l).. Phytoplankton composition, nitrate reductase activity, and phytoplankton ultrastructure were investigated. In the first experiment, the non-nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria only responded to the ammonium treatment. In the second and third experiments, significant increases in the non-nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria were detected in the ammonium bags, relative to both the nitrate and control bags. The underlying mechanism causing the indicated difference in competitive ability for inorganic nitrogen between prokaryotic and eukaryotic phytoplankton is still unknown. One possible explanation suggested by measurements in this study is that induction of nitrate reductase activity, due to the presence of nitrate, is less efficient in prokaryotic cells than in eukaryotes. The relevance of the inorganic nitrogen hypothesis is discussed in relation to a previously published model of phytoplankton succession in Lake Erken. To conclude, our findings imply that the theory regarding inorganic nitrogen is a missing link in the understanding of the competitive ability of cyanobacteria.																			0071-1128		3-510-47053-2				1998	51						29	40																WOS:000078414300003

Changes were made in handling of animal wastes and cropping practices to reduce runoff of sediment and nutrients. Modelling results predicted a reduction in phosphorus runoff of 30 percent. The water quality of White Clay Lake has worsened since the installation of NPS controls. The lake's phosphorus concentration has increased from a mean of 29 mug L-1 in the late 1970s to 44 mug L-1 in recent years. Water clarity has declined from 2.7 to 2.1 m and the mean summer chlorophyll levels have increased from 9 to 13 mug L-1 with peak values exceeding 40 mug L-1. Increased phosphorus loading is not the result of elevated precipitation but instead the failure of the control measures to sufficiently reduce P loading. Most of the effort was placed on structural changes while most of the P loading comes from cropland runoff. Further, soil phosphorus concentrations have increased because of artificial fertilizers and manure spreading. The White Clay Lake experience is discouraging since the majority of the polluters in this watershed utilized some NPS control practices, including 76 percent of the farms which installed waste management control facilities.																			0273-1223						1993	28	3-5					441	449		10.2166/wst.1993.0447	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.1993.0447													WOS:A1993MA14800051

Mapping cyanobacterial blooms in Lake Champlain's Missisquoi Bay using QuickBird and MERIS satellite data	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												C-phycocyanin (C-PC) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations for the eutrophic waters of Missisquoi Bay, Lake Champlain (VT-QC) were retrieved from Envisat's MERIS radiance data (300 m spatial resolution) and validated against coincident georeferenced transect observations. Pigment concentrations were also predicted from empirically calibrated QuickBird data (2.4 m spatial resolution) using selected band ratios and principal components analysis. The QuickBird NIR/Red band ratio accounted for approximately 80% of the variability in observed Chl-a concentration, allowing for detailed mapping of phytoplankton spatial distributions. C-PC concentrations, in contrast, were somewhat poorly modeled (R-2 = 0.68). Use of these data for monitoring purposes, however, is also limited by the need for coincident field observations. Chl-a concentrations were also accurately retrieved from the MERIS data (Mean Relative Error = -0.6%) despite high concentrations of suspended particles and dissolved organic matter in the bay waters. C-PC concentrations were underestimated on average by 2.1%, but by 10-20% at high C-PC concentrations (>= 80 mu g/L) and as the proportion of cyanobacteria in the phytoplankton community decreased. The relatively high overall accuracies observed, however, attest to the robustness of the MERIS semi-analytical retrieval algorithms used to quantify potentially toxic cyanobacteria cell densities without the need for coincident field data. Our analyses over a 17 day period captured the peak and collapse of a late summer cyanobacterial bloom, illustrating the value of remote sensing to provide synoptic and timely information on the abundance and distribution of cyanobacterial populations that, in turn, can facilitate public health risk assessment.

Detection Probabilities of Flathead Catfish in Small Kansas Impoundments	JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												A primary challenge of Flathead Catfish Pylodictis olivaris management is uncertainty associated with sampling strategies and resulting ambiguity in population-level information. Assessment of impoundment and environmental conditions that affect detection probability may aid in reducing sample variance and benefit inferences regarding changes to Flathead Catfish populations. We sampled eight small impoundments in Kansas (37-114 surface ha) using low-frequency electrofishing in summer, 2021. We revisited sites nine times over three months using an occupancy modeling framework to estimate the influence of impoundment and environmental conditions on detection probability of Flathead Catfish. We employed an information theoretic approach and ranked models built with impoundment as a random effect and three environmental variables predicted to influence detection of Flathead Catfish in small impoundments. Detection probability across all populations was 0.526 (SE 5 0.020) and was influenced by water temperature, mean depth of the impoundment, and proportion of impoundment sampled. Generally, detection probability increased with all measured variables. The inclusion of detection probability in assessments of Flathead Catfish in small impoundments can inform interpretation of catch-related metrics. Further, variable detection suggests collection of multiple samples during a defined sampling period might be more suitable for characterizing populations than a single sample.																			1944-687X					DEC	2024	15	2								10.3996/JFWM-23-057	http://dx.doi.org/10.3996/JFWM-23-057													WOS:001488839600017

Stressors in a bottle: A microcosm study on phytoplankton assemblage response to extreme precipitation events under climate warming	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												The climatic stressors that are affecting lake ecosystems, especially phytoplankton, are projected to become more intense with continued climate change (e.g., heatwaves, precipitation events). Concerns over the combined effects that multiple, coinciding stressors can have on phytoplankton necessitates investigating the impacts of different regional climate scenarios. A microcosm study was conducted to assess the responses of a phytoplankton assemblage containing a cyanobacterium (Anabaena flos-aquae), a green alga (Chlorella vulgaris) and a diatom (Synedra) to a northwestern European summer scenario. Eutrophic microcosms were exposed to a full-factorial design including a press temperature treatment scenario (ambient or warm) and a pulse precipitation treatment (no runoff simulation or runoff simulation). Warming scenarios had significant effects on the phytoplankton assemblage biomass, which supports our first hypothesis (H1: higher water temperatures under eutrophic conditions will support larger phytoplankton biomasses, especially cyanobacteria). By contrast, the extreme precipitation runoff event had minimal and short-lived effects on the microcosm assemblage. Overall, the interaction between the two climate stressors was antagonistic. In contrast with our second hypothesis (H2: nutrient additions from extreme precipitation runoff will promote more productivity in higher temperature microcosms), the precipitation runoff event was not amplified by temperature. Our results indicate that the combined effect of two climate stressors on a phytoplankton community are not necessarily synergistic or multiplicative. Our findings on antagonistic interactions between climatic stressors necessitate future studies assessing variations of intensity and duration of the climatic stressors.

In addition, Chilliwack seedlings responded specifically to biota present only in Chilliwack soil. To determine if rhizosphere bacteria were involved in these growth responses, bacteria were isolated from the rhizosphere of wild Douglas-fir seedlings collected from both locations, and putative growth promoting bacteria were selected in a screening experiment. Selected bacteria were then tested for seedling growth response specificity using a factorial design in which seed, soil, and bacteria from both locations were evaluated in all combinations. Inoculation of Douglas-fir seed with some of the selected bacterial isolates increased seedling biomass in pasteurized soil to a level similar to that of seedlings grown in unpasteurized soil, but there was no evidence that adaptive relationships involving bacteria, Douglas-fir, and the soil in which they naturally grew were important in effecting seedling growth promotion. However, Douglas-fir shoot biomass increased 39% and root biomass 68% after bacterial inoculation in some treatment combinations involving pasteurized soil.																			0008-4026					MAY	1992	70	5					1025	1031		10.1139/b92-127	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b92-127													WOS:A1992JG56400015
J	Zhang, SR; Wang, DD; Li, MY; Yan, FQ; Xu, QH				Zhang, Shengrui; Wang, Dandan; Li, Manyue; Yan, Fangqing; Xu, Qinghai			Significant weak monsoon events during the early to middle Holocene transition: Pollen evidence from an alpine lake in North China	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The response characteristics of East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) precipitation to abrupt climatic events during the early to middle Holocene transition may provide insights into the response of EASM precipitation to possible extreme climatic events under future global warming scenarios. We present a high-resolution (-10 yr) pollen record from a hydrologically closed alpine lake (Yazihai Lake) in North China spanning the interval of 9000-7500 cal yr BP. The results reveal two significant weak monsoon events during 8830-8730 cal yr BP and 8100-8000 cal yr BP. Based on a comparison with the GRIP delta O-18 ice core record from Greenland and the stalagmite delta O-18 record from Dongge Cave in South China, we suggest that the second weak monsoon event (8100-8000 cal yr BP) recorded at Yazihai Lake corresponds to the 8.2 ka event that originated in the North Atlantic region, it is spatially and temporally synchronous between the northern and the southern parts of the EASM region and is characterized by a significant decrease in EASM precipitation. For the first weak monsoon event (8830-8730 cal yr BP) recorded at Yazihai Lake, it was also captured by pollen, stalagmite delta O-18, and marine sedimentary records from middle to low latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, and its nature and amplitude resemble the 8.2 ka event. We infer that the possible cause of these two significant weak monsoon events was related to the southward shift of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) due to the collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), triggered by meltwater influx to the North Atlantic Ocean, and that the abrupt climate signals were transmitted via the monsoon circulation from low latitudes to middle-high latitudes in the EASM region.

J	Bergman, I; Lindstrom, ES; Sassenhagen, I				Bergman, Ingrid; Lindstrom, Eva S.; Sassenhagen, Ingrid			Ciliate Grazing on the Bloom-Forming Microalga Gonyostomum semen	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												The freshwater raphidophyte Gonyostomum semen forms extensive summer blooms in northern European humic lakes. The development of these blooms might be facilitated by a lack of natural top-down control, as few zooplankton species are able to prey on these large algal cells (up to 100 mu m) that expel trichocysts upon physical stress. In this study, we describe a small ciliate species (< 17 mu m) that preys on G. semen by damaging the cell membrane until cytoplasm and organelles spill out. Sequencing of clonal cultures of the ciliate tentatively identified it as the prostomatid species Urotricha pseudofurcata. Grazing experiments illustrated that feeding by U. cf. pseudofurcata can significantly reduce cell concentrations of the microalga. However, differences in cell size and growth rate between two investigated ciliate strains resulted in noticeably different grazing pressure. Environmental sequencing data from five different lakes supported potential interactions between the two species. Urotricha cf. pseudofurcata might, thus, play an important role in aquatic ecosystems that are regularly dominated by G. semen, reducing the abundance of this bloom-forming microalga and enabling transfer of organic carbon to higher trophic levels.					; Lindström, Eva/H-5930-2016	Lindstrom, Eva/0000-0001-8920-3071; Bergman, Ingrid/0000-0002-1227-9251; Sassenhagen, Ingrid/0000-0002-5969-2289													0095-3628	1432-184X				DEC	2024	87	1							33	10.1007/s00248-024-02344-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-024-02344-9								38236289					WOS:001145053200001
J	Kremer, B; Kazmierczak, J; Kempe, S				Kremer, Barbara; Kazmierczak, Jozef; Kempe, Stephan			Authigenic replacement of cyanobacterially precipitated calcium carbonate by aluminium-silicates in giant microbialites of Lake Van (Turkey)	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Studies of modern cyanobacterial mats and biofilms show that they can precipitate minerals as a consequence of metabolic and degradational activities paired with ambient hydrochemical conditions. This study looked at modern microbial mats forming giant, tower-like, groundwater-fed, calcareous microbialites in the world's largest, highly alkaline lake; Van Golu (Lake Van), East Turkey. Results show that microbial systems play a role not only in carbonate precipitation but also in the formation of siliceous mineral phases. Transmitted light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and spectral observations revealed that, within the extracellular polymeric substances excreted by the mats abundant minute aragonite grains precipitated first invivo. These minute grains were quickly succeeded and/or supplemented in the dead biomass of the cyanobacterial mat by authigenic Al-Mg-Fe siliceous phases. Silicon dioxide is available in large concentrations in the highly alkaline water of Lake Van. Divalent cations (Ca and Mg) are delivered to the microbialites mostly by groundwater springs. The precipitation of the fine-grained siliceous phases is probably mediated by bacteria degrading the cyanobacterial biomass and complexing the excessive cations with their extracellular polymeric envelopes. The bacteria serve as nucleation centres for the subsequent precipitation of siliceous mineral phases. Generally, the biphasic (calcareous and siliceous) mineralization - characterizing Lake Van microbialites - is controlled by their interior highly dynamic hydrogeochemical situation. There, the dramatically different alkaline lake water and the Ca-Mg-charged groundwater mix at various rates. The early diagenetic replacement of the invivo aragonite by authigenic siliceous phases significantly increases the fossilization potential of the mat-forming cyanobacteria. Lake Van and its giant microbialite tufa towers act as a model explaining the transformation of early diagenetic mineral phases observed in many modern and ancient carbonate marine deposits, particularly those influenced by diffusion of silica-enriched and metal-enriched pore waters from below the water-sediment interface.

J	White, JS; Null, SE; Tarboton, DG				White, James S.; Null, Sarah E.; Tarboton, David G.			How Do Changes to the Railroad Causeway in Utah's Great Salt Lake Affect Water and Salt Flow?	PLOS ONE												Managing terminal lake elevation and salinity are emerging problems worldwide. We contribute to terminal lake management research by quantitatively assessing water and salt flow for Utah's Great Salt Lake. In 1959, Union Pacific Railroad constructed a rock-filled causeway across the Great Salt Lake, separating the lake into a north and south arm. Flow between the two arms was limited to two 4.6 meter wide rectangular culverts installed during construction, an 88 meter opening (referred to locally as a breach) installed in 1984, and the semi porous material of the causeway. A salinity gradient developed between the two arms of the lake over time because the south arm receives approximately 95% of the incoming streamflow entering Great Salt Lake. The north arm is often at, or near, salinity saturation, averaging 317 g/L since 1966, while the south is considerably less saline, averaging 142 g/L since 1966. Ecological and industrial uses of the lake are dependent on long-term salinity remaining within physiological and economic thresholds, although optimal salinity varies for the ecosystem and between diverse stakeholders. In 2013, Union Pacific Railroad closed causeway culverts amid structural safety concerns and proposed to replace them with a bridge, offering four different bridge designs. As of summer 2015, no bridge design has been decided upon. We investigated the effect that each of the proposed bridge designs would have on north and south arm Great Salt Lake elevation and salinity by updating and applying US Geological Survey's Great Salt Lake Fortran Model. Overall, we found that salinity is sensitive to bridge size and depth, with larger designs increasing salinity in the south arm and decreasing salinity in the north arm. This research illustrates that flow modifications within terminal lakes cannot be separated from lake salinity, ecology, management, and economic uses.

However, detailed information about the role of Dolichospermum in shaping bloom dynamics and producing cyanotoxins is limited. In this study, a bloom event dominated by Dolichospermum spp. at Detroit Lake (Oregon, USA) was examined from 2019 to 2021. In 2019, early summer cyanobacterial community succession reached up to 8.7 % of total phytoplankton abundance. Dolichospermum was the major microcystin (MC)-producing genus, with peak MC levels of 7.34 mu g L-1. The presence of MCs was strongly correlated with the abundance of Dolichospermum (r = 0.84, p < 0.05) and MC synthetase gene, mcyE-Ana (r = 0.63, p < 0.05). Metabolic analyses further showed that the presence of nif/pst genes linked to nitrogen and phosphorus metabolism was dominated by Dolichospermum from the bloom onset until September. In addition, the abundance of Dolichospermum was significantly correlated with the abundance of nitrogen-fixing nif-Ana gene (r = 0.62, p < 0.05). As the lake experienced a longer N and P scarcity period (May to September), the N-2-fixing Dolichospermum was able to dominate over other non-fixing cyanobacteria present, including Microcystis and Planktothrix. Overall, our results facilitate a better understanding of the organism and will help working toward managing/predicting future blooms.					; Villegas, Eric/A-7373-2015	Clauson, Kale/0000-0002-0037-7495; Rosen, Barry/0000-0002-8016-3939													1568-9883	1878-1470				FEB	2025	142								102802	10.1016/j.hal.2025.102802	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2025.102802		JAN 2025						39947845					WOS:001409369400001

Nevertheless, fishy odor-producing algae and corresponding fishy odorants were not very clear, odor contribution of fishy odorant and odor-producing algae to overall odor profile were also not well understood. In this study, the fishy odorants, produced by four algae separated from Yanlong Lake, were identified simultaneously. Odor contribution of identified odorant, separated algae to overall fishy odor profile were both evaluated. The results indicated Yanlong Lake was mainly associated with fishy odor (flavor profile analysis (FPA) intensity: 6), eight, five, five and six fishy odorants were identified and determined in Cryptomonas ovate, Dinobryon sp., Synura uvella, Ochromonas sp., respectively, which were separated and cultured from water source. Totally sixteen odorants with concentration range of 90-880 ng/L, including hexanal, heptanal, 2,4-heptadienal, 1-octen-3-one, 1-octen-3-ol, octanal, 2-octenal, 2,4-octadienal, nonanal, 2-nonenal, 2,6-nonadienal, decanal, 2-decenal, 2,4decadienal, undecanal, 2-tetradecanone, were verified in separated algae and associated with fishy odor. Although more odorants' odor activity value (OAV) were lower than one, approximately 89%, 91%, 87%, 90% of fishy odor intensities could be explained by reconstituting identified odorants for Cryptomonas ovate, Dinobryon sp., Synura uvella, Ochromonas sp., respectively, suggesting synergistic effect could exist among identified odorants. By calculating and evaluating total odorant production, total odorant OAV and cell odorant yield of separated algae, odor contribution rank to overall fishy odor should be Cryptomonas ovate (28.19%), Dinobryon sp. (27.05%), Synura uvella (24.27%), Ochromonas sp. (20.49%).

J	Picozzi, M; Serlenga, V; Stabile, TA				Picozzi, Matteo; Serlenga, Vincenzo; Stabile, Tony Alfredo			Spatio-temporal evolution of ground motion intensity caused by reservoir-induced seismicity at the Pertusillo artificial lake (southern Italy)	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE												We investigate the spatiotemporal evolution of ground motion caused by reservoir-induced seismicity at the Pertusillo artificial lake in southern Italy. The area has a strong seismogenic potential, having been affected in the past by the 1857, Mw 7.0 Basilicata earthquake. We consider & SIM;1,000 microearthquakes that occurred from 2001 to 2018 and were recorded by a local network of nine seismic stations. The ground motion intensity associated with microseismicity allows us to identify two periods, each lasting approximately 2 years. They are characterized by a high rate of events but exhibit different source properties and spatial distributions. In the first period, the seismicity is spatially clustered close to the lake, on faults with different orientations and kinematics. In the second period, the seismicity is distributed along the Monti della Maddalena faults. Comparing the ground motion intensities of the two periods, we observe that events that occurred in the first period are associated with higher stress levels than others, in agreement with the b-values of the respective frequency-magnitude distributions. We compare the temporal evolution of the ground motion intensity with the rainfall and water levels measured at the artificial lake, as well as with the discharge of a & SIM;80 km distant spring, which is strictly controlled by climate trends. The results provide information about the regional processes acting on the southern Apennines. Our results show that the microseismicity is clearly associated with the Pertusillo artificial lake in the first period, whereas in the second period is a result of a combination of local effects due to water table oscillations of the lake itself, regional tectonics, and the poroelastic and elastic phenomena associated with carbonate rocks hosting aquifers.

Late glacial and Holocene environmental changes inferred from sediments in Lake Myklevatnet, Nordfjord, western Norway	VEGETATION HISTORY AND ARCHAEOBOTANY												Late Glacial and Holocene environmental changes were reconstructed using physical, chemical and biological proxies in Lake Myklevatnet, Allmenningen, (5A(0)13'17aEuro(3)E, 61A(0)55'13aEuro(3)N) located at the northern side of Nordfjorden at the coast of western Norway. Myklevatnet (123 m a.s.l.) lies above the Late Glacial marine limit and contains sediments back to approximately 14,300 years before a.d. 2000 (b2k). Because the lake is located similar to 48 km beyond the margin of the Younger Dryas (YD) fjord and valley glaciers further inland, and did not receive glacier meltwater from local glaciers during the YD, the lake record provides supplementary information to Lake KrAyenkenes that received glacial meltwater from a local YD glacier. Lake Myklevatnet has a small catchment and is sensitive to Late Glacial and Holocene climate and environmental changes in the coastal region of western Norway. The age-depth relationship was inferred from a radiocarbon- and tephra-based smoothing-spline model with correlated ages from oxygen isotope maxima and minima in the Late Glacial sequence of the NGRIP ice core (in years b2k) to refine the basal chronology in the Myklevatnet record. The results indicate a two-step YD warming, colder early YD temperatures than in the later part of the YD, and considerably more climate and environmental variability during the late Holocene in western Norway than recorded previously in the oxygen isotopes from Greenland ice cores. The Myklevatnet record is also compared with other Late Glacial and Holocene terrestrial and marine proxy reconstructions in the North Atlantic realm.

To investigate the evolution of the major histocompatibility complex (Mhc) genes in the period immediately following speciation, the class I genes from 20 of the 22 species were cloned and characterized by sequencing. The analysis revealed the existence of multiple loci (at least seven in some individuals) whose numbers vary among the different species and probably also among individuals of the same species. The variation does not seem to bear any relationship to the taxonomy of the genus. Genes at the different loci are distinguished by their intron sequences and by the presence of characteristic motifs in exons 2 and 3. The variation in copy number of loci may have been effected in part by unequal crossing over occurring between introns of misaligned closely related genes. The sequences of the genes fall into two groups, A and B, which represent ancient lineages. The groups define two families of loci, which diverged from each other an estimated 85 million years ago, before the separation of the Acanthopterygii from the Paracanthopterygii of the advanced bony fishes. Evolution of the genes within each family can be explained by the birth-and-death process driven by gene duplications and mutational differentiation.																			0093-7711					OCT	2001	53	8					695	708		10.1007/s00251-001-0378-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00251-001-0378-8								11797104					WOS:000172962300011

Influence of hook type and live bait on the hooking performance of inline spinners in the context of catch-and-release brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis fishing in lakes	FISHERIES RESEARCH												The objective of catch-and-release angling is for the fish to survive with minimal fitness consequences. However, fish survival can be compromised by a number of factors, especially anatomical hooking location. To evaluate whether hook type or bait influence hooking outcomes, we tested different combinations of hook (treble or single siwash hooks) and bait (hook tipped with worm or no worm) while angling for brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) with inline spinner-style fishing lures. The study was conducted at spring water temperatures (similar to 20 degrees C) in small lakes stocked with trout in southwestern Quebec, Canada. Incidences of hooking in the interior of the mouth (i.e. internal hooking) were uncommon (19%), did not differ significantly between hook types or bait treatments, and occurred independently of fish size. Reflex impairments after hook removal were not related to hook or bait treatment. Short-term mortality was quantified with 24 h holding in net pens and was determined to be infrequent for all treatment groups (treble/worm: 6%; treble/no worm: 5%; single/worm: 2%; single/no worm: 0%). Although no fish were hooked in the gills, esophagus, stomach, odds of mortality increased by 14.21 when fish were hooked internally, which is consistent with the position that hook placement is an important predictor of the fate of fish released by anglers. However, our finding that neither hook nor bait type significantly increased the odds of internal hooking, bleeding, reflex impairment, or mortality in this study suggests that restrictions imposed on the use of baited lures or certain hook types attached to lures when fishing may have little influence on short-term catch-and-release mortality of brook trout at these temperatures.

Shallow-water (< 2 m deep) wetlands in northern Alberta's western boreal forest tend to have either extremely high-chlorophyll, pea-green water or water that is low in chlorophyll and clear. The relative importance of top-down processes (e.g. zooplankton grazing) compared with bottom-up processes (e.g. nutrient limitation) for regulating the existence of these alternate states has yet to be explicitly investigated in these poorly studied waterbodies. 2. To assess the relationship between chemical and biological factors and the predominance of low-chlorophyll over high-chlorophyll states, a survey of 24 shallow-water wetlands in northern Alberta was conducted over the summers of 2001 and 2002. 3. In wetlands without fish, statistical analysis indicated that high- and low-chlorophyll sites could be differentiated with 82% accuracy based solely on whether submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) coverage was greater or less than 25%. Further, high-SAV lakes with zooplankton communities dominated by large cladocerans were clear 96% of the time. 4. In the few wetlands that supported stickleback populations, large cladocerans were absent. However, the development of zooplankton communities dominated by small cladocera (Bosmina) with calanoid copepods in fish-containing wetlands corresponded with a shift from high- to low-chlorophyll states. 5. Results suggest that in fishless wetlands high-SAV coverage and grazing by large, SAV-associated cladocerans promotes low-chlorophyll states. Results also suggest that suppression of macroinvertebrate predators by sticklebacks allowing Bosmina to flourish may also promote low-chlorophyll, clear-water conditions.

This zone records pervasive deformation (DSL1) at conditions of <^>-0.52 GPa and <^>-700 degrees C, and localized deformation (DSL2) at >0.5 GPa and 300-500 degrees C that preserve left lateral and right lateral senses of movement, respectively. Neocrystallized DSL1 titanite in a hornblende-bearing granodiorite yields an age of 1804 +/- 6 Ma, interpreted to be the timing of DSL1. The timing of DSL2 is loosely bracketed by 40Ar/39Ar hornblende (1814 +/- 3 Ma) and biotite (1743 +/- 1 Ma) cooling ages since the deformation temperature falls between the estimated closure temperature of these minerals. Similar rock types and metamorphic conditions on either side of the shear zone rule out the SLsz as a terrane boundary. Rather, strain localization may have been triggered by thermal softening related to the emplacement of a northeast-trending belt of high-temperature granites south of the shear zone between 1840 and 1820 Ma. Deformation and metamorphism at ca. 1.81 Ga south of Boothia Peninsula and in the central Rae (Committee Bay belt) have been attributed to the Superior Province colliding with the southeastern margin of the Rae craton, such that the SLsz may too have formed in response to far-field stresses derived from this collision. The absence of ca. 1.81 Ga tectonic fabrics north of the shear zone indicates that the SLsz marks the northwestern extent of mid-crustal, Trans-Hudson related tectonometamorphism.					; Larson, Kyle/AAG-9448-2020	DuFrane, Scott/0009-0005-6143-6187; Osinchuk, Alix/0000-0003-1390-9371; Drayson, Derek/0000-0001-5019-6206; Regis, Daniele/0000-0003-0347-4060													0008-4077	1480-3313				DEC	2022	59	12					1031	1052		10.1139/cjes-2022-0046	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjes-2022-0046		AUG 2022											WOS:000887085800001

Hydrochemical variables, sediment, and vegetation were analyzed. In total 156 different localities were investigated. Habitat diversity was based mainly upon the closely correlated hydrochemical variables of mineralization (hardness total and carbonate, conductivity, total value of dissolved substances), although bottom, vegetation characteristics and other factors (pH, dissolved oxygen, nutrients) were also significant. The ostracods found included 62 species in 27 genera comprising 8 cosmopolitan, 17 Holarctic, 13 Palearctic species; 21 of these species are known from central and southern Europe and adjacent areas, while 3 are characteristic for eastern Europe. The distribution of freshwater ostracod assemblages reflected the habitat and depended on water body type. Heterogeneous oxbows and temporary pools supported 37 species, while other types of pool maintained only 27-14 species. The population density of different species varied from 0.5 to more than 10 000 ind./m(2) Indices of local alpha diversity were significantly correlated with the number of species and temperature and were maximal in heterogeneous habitats. The variation of population density was not connected with habitat patterns but appeared to be regulated by the biotic interactions in the community. Habitat diversity, verified by the beta-diversity indices, enabled us to find localities with a similar heterogeneity level and species richness. Beta-diversity values were independent of species number as well as abundance but a significant positive correlation (p < 0.05) was found with temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen. This index probably reflected the general patterns of different localities.

It is important to note the monographs and articles of H. Badalian and B. Toumanian in this field. As the result of our work in this field, beginning of the Haykian calendar (BC 2341) and the concept of Protohaykian calendar were established. In the present work an attempt is made to determine the beginning of the oldest Armenian calendar the Protohaykian calendar. It is shown that Protohaykian calendar was originated when the heliacal rising of the star Spica (a Virgo) was observable from Armenia 8 days before summer solstice. Calculations made on this basis provide date of the beginning of this calendar as BC 9000 with an error not to exceed 80 years. This date is in correspondence with the date of observations of the Pleiades from Metsamor (about BC 9000), that was found a few years ago. Meanwhile, it also corresponds to the geological data, which prove, that the oldest lake (Araratian Sea) in the territory of modem Araratian valley was dried out at the same time. There is also good correlation with the time of cultivation of crops that was done in the territory of historical Armenia about 12000 years ago.																					978-1-58381-906-7				2017	511						296	302																WOS:000411770300051

Solute dispersion in the coastal boundary layer of southern Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												We evaluate a three-dimensional, nested-grid nearshore model of Lake Michigan for its ability to describe key aspects of hydrodynamics and solute transport using data from a field study conducted in summer 2008. Velocity comparisons with observations from five bottom-mounted ADCPs at different depths in the coastal boundary layer (CBL) show that the numerical model was able to simulate currents and flow reversals accurately within the inertial boundary layer, however model accuracy reduced close to the shoreline. Power spectra of observed and simulated velocity time series at different locations showed that the hydrodynamic model was able to describe the energy contained in the inertial scales, but over-predicted turbulent dissipation rates. As a result, model-predicted values of energy in the smaller, dissipation scales were lower compared to values calculated from observations in the CBL. Differences between energy contained in the observed and simulated velocity spectra increased as the shoreline is approached. Observations showed that vertical variations in the alongshore and cross-shore velocities were dominated by inertial waves. Inaccuracies in representing energy dissipation rates and processes not explicitly described in the hydrodynamic model (e.g., anisotropy, waves) could potentially contribute to errors in describing transport in the CBL. Measurements from a continuous dye release experiment from a riverine outfall were described using a nearshore model with a mean horizontal dispersion coefficient of 5.6 m(2)/s. Improved representations of physical processes (such as turbulence, internal waves and wave-current interactions) can be expected to provide better descriptions of solute transport in the CBL.

J	Hofle, C; Ping, CL				Hofle, C; Ping, CL			Properties and soil development of late-Pleistocene paleosols from Seward Peninsula, northwest Alaska	GEODERMA												Soils on Seward Peninsula, northwest Alaska, that were buried about 17,500 years ago and froze after burial present a unique opportunity to study soil development under the conditions of the last glacial maximum, Stratigraphic sections were excavated during the summers of 1993 and 1994. Study sites were located on steep banks of thaw lakes. We described soil morphology (including cryogenic features) and sampled for chemical and physical analyses. All paleosols are permafrost soils that developed in calcareous loess and have roots present throughout. Colors are predominantly grayish and either reflect original loess color or periodic saturation of the soils (possibly caused by the permafrost environment). Active layer thicknesses before burial ranged from 32 to 64 cm. Organic carbon contents average 3.0%, carbon/nitrogen ratios average 9, cation exchange capacities average 19.1 cmol/kg, and base saturations generally exceed 100%. There is no evidence of leaching in the profile. Soil formation occurred simultaneously to the deposition of the parent material loess, Morphological and chemical data suggest that soil development was weak and confined to organic matter accumulation, and hydrolysis of iron. All studied soils show similar morphological, chemical, and physical properties, which suggests a relatively uniform mode of soil formation in the study area. Soil-forming conditions on northern Seward Peninsula during the last glacial maximum were severe, and combined with fairly continuous loess deposition they resulted in weakly developed, nutrient-rich soils.																			0016-7061					JUN	1996	71	3-4					219	243		10.1016/0016-7061(96)00007-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7061(96)00007-9													WOS:A1996UX75000003

It has been found that the purple sulfur bacterium "Thiodictyon syntrophicum" strain Cad16(T), belonging to the Chromatiaceae, fixes around 26% of all bulk inorganic carbon in the chemocline, both during day and night. With this study, we elucidated for the first time the mode of carbon fixation of str. Cad16(T) under micro-oxic conditions with a combination of long-term monitoring of key physicochemical parameters with CTD,C-14-incorporation experiments and quantitative proteomics using in-situ dialysis bag incubations of str. Cad16(T) cultures. Regular vertical CTD profiling during the study period in summer 2017 revealed that the chemocline sank from 12 to 14 m which was accompanied by a bloom of cyanobacteria and the subsequent oxygenation of the deeper water column. Sampling was performed both day and night. CO2 assimilation rates were higher during the light period compared to those in the dark, both in the chemocline population and in the incubated cultures. The relative change in the proteome between day and night (663 quantified proteins) comprised only 1% of all proteins encoded in str. Cad16(T). Oxidative respiration pathways were upregulated at light, whereas stress-related mechanisms prevailed during the night. These results indicate that low light availability and the co-occurring oxygenation of the chemocline induced mixotrophic growth in str. Cad16(T). Our study thereby helps to further understand the consequences micro-oxic conditions for phototrophic sulfur oxidizing bacteria. The complete proteome data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange database with identifier PXD010641.

The long-term glacial-interglacial changes of sea ice coverage and its impacts on terrigenous transport and surface primary productivity in the Okhotsk Sea remain, however, not well constrained. Base on the paleomagnetic, rock magnetic, micropaleontological (diatom), and geochemical studies of the marine sediment core MD01-2414 (53 degrees 11.77 ' N, 149 degrees 34.80 ' E, water depth: 1,123 m) taken in the central Okhotsk Sea, we reconstruct the terrigenous sediment transport and paleoceanographic variations during the past 1550 thousand years (kyr). Seventeen geomagnetic excursions are identified from the paleomagnetic directional record. Close to the bottom of the core, an excursion was observed, which is proposed to be the Gilsa event similar to 1550 thousand years ago (ka). During glacial intervals, our records reveal a wide extension of sea ice coverage and low marine productivity. We observed ice-rafted debris from mountain icebergs composed of coarse and high magnetic terrigenous detritus which were derived from the Kamchatka Peninsula to the central Okhotsk basin. Still during glacial intervals, the initiation (i.e., at similar to 900 ka) of the Mid-Pleistocene Transition marks the changes to even lower marine productivity, suggesting that sea-ice coverage became larger during the last 900 ka. During interglacial intervals, the central Okhotsk Sea was either devoid of sea-ice or the ice was at best seasonal; resulting in high marine productivity. The weaker formation of Okhotsk Sea Intermediate Water, lower ventilation, and microbial degradation of organic matter depleted the oxygen concentration in the bottom water and created a reduced environment condition in the sea basin. The freshwater supplied by snow or glacier melting from Siberia and Kamchatka delivered fine grain sediments to the Okhotsk Sea. During the stronger interglacial intervals after the Mid-Brunhes Transition (i.e., Marine Isotope Stages 1, 5e, 9, and 11), strong freshwater discharges from Amur River drainage area are in association with intensified East Asian Summer Monsoon. This process may have enhanced the input of fine-grained terrigenous sediments to the central Okhotsk Sea.

Decline of springtime abundance of the pileworm Neanthes succinea in relation to hydrographic conditions at the Salton Sea, California	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												The Salton Sea is the largest lake in California, and its most abundant macroinvertebrate is the pileworm (Neanthes succinea: Polychaeta). This is a major dietary item for three of the four most abundant fish species in the lake, and for at least one waterbird, the eared grebe (Podiceps nigricollis). Pileworm abundance in April 2004 was monitored at depths of 2, 6 and 10 m on seven transects distributed around the perimeter of the lake. Temperature and oxygen showed marked stratification with depth. Densities were compared to those observed in April 1999. Abundances at 2 m stations were similar to those in 1999; however, densities were greatly reduced at 6 and 10 m stations compared to 1999. The development of hypoxic or anoxic bottom conditions apparently occurred earlier in the spring in 2004 than in 1999. This was the most likely cause for the low densities at 6 and 10 m. Worm densities were higher at sites with coarser sediments (sand and/or barnacle shell debris), and lowest at 2 m sites near or downstream of freshwater inflows and at 10 m where near anoxic conditions prevailed. In March 2005, a sampling of 74 stations at depths ranging from 1 m to 10 m all around the perimeter of the lake found only a single pileworm. It was evident that the lake had just turned over and that sulfide levels were very high and had probably killed off most pileworms and many other organisms as well.

The hydrodynamics in this cross section were analyzed quantitatively using a two-dimensional finite element code that solves the coupled variable-density ground-water flow and conductive-convective heat transfer equations, On the basis of numerical simulations, different mechanisms of basin-scale groundwater convection are suggested for the two sides of the rift that could influence the transport of heat: (1) forced convection (gravity-driven flow) of hot brines from deeper aquifers to the land surface at the western side; and (2) large scale free convection (buoyancy-driven flow) of deep ground water at the eastern side. The different heat fluxes within the rift valley are attributed to the different lithologies and to the locations of specific conduits through which the hot ground waters ascend from deeper horizons, These simulations also explain the different salinities of the hot springs on the two sides of the rift.																			0016-7606					SEP	1997	109	9					1167	1176		10.1130/0016-7606(1997)109<1167:TAAWFA>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/0016-7606(1997)109<1167:TAAWFA>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1997XX22300008

Evaluation of Stormwater Treatment Vault with Coanda-Effect Screen for Removal of Solids and Phosphorus in Urban Runoff	JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE WATER IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT												Catch basins commonly are used by cities as part of a stormwater management plan to remove sediment and associated contaminants from stormwater, keeping them in compliance with regulations. Recently, the city of Madison, Wisconsin modified traditional catch basins by incorporating a fine-mesh (1-mm) Coanda-effect screen into the design with the goal of increasing removal of sediment and organic matter from stormwater. The US Geological Survey (USGS), in cooperation with the City of Madison, installed a water-quality monitoring station at such a catch basin to quantify reductions in total suspended solids (TSS), volatile suspended solids (VSS), suspended sediment concentration (SSC), total phosphorus (TP), and dissolved phosphorus (DP) from urban stormwater before entering Lake Monona. A comparison of the cumulative load from 33 samples collected during the summers of 2016 and 2017 showed 23% and 45% reductions in TSS and SSC, respectively. A smaller reduction was observed for TP, 16%, whereas DP remained unchanged. Reported traditional catch basin sediment removal varies greatly, although typical removal rates are similar. Results from this study will help regulated municipalities determine whether the use of screened catch basins can help meet water-quality goals.

The most severe environmental problem facing the lake is the impact of water level regime fluctuation related to natural and human-caused factors. A core region under study is selected a territory of the Angarsky Sor - a shallow bay located in the Northeast of the lake. The research into a changing water content of the territory is based on imaginary provided by the Landsat-8 satellite. The study is focused on photographs taken in the high-water summer 2014 and in the law water level year 2015. The outcome of performed calculations is that an area of marshy and excessively wet regions has decreased more than 1.5 times, whereas there is a slight increase in the area of droughty waterless zones. Principal changes have been detected in the northern and north-eastern part of the Sor territory. Geoinformation technologies and remote sensing methods are considered to be efficient for the monitoring water level fluctuations, changes in the water surface area and vegetation mantle state of land ecosystems in the Sor region, what is essential for the preserving unique wetlands of the Angarsky Sor.

J	Liu, HW; Wu, KJ; Du, MX; Fu, N				Liu, Haiwen; Wu, Kaijun; Du, Mengxing; Fu, Ning			Probabilistic Evaluation of Tibetan Plateau Mesoscale Vortex on 18 July 2013	ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY												Tibetan Plateau (TP) mesoscale vortex (TPMV) was regarded as one of the most important rain bearing systems in China. Previous studies focused on the mechanisms of the TPMV in the viewpoint of deterministic forecast; however, few studies investigate the predictability of the TPMV using the Observing System Research and Predictability Experiment (THORPEX) Interactive Grand Global Ensemble (TIGGE) from the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECWMF). This paper investigates the location and the intensity of the larger-scale synoptic systems that influenced the development of the TPMV and its associated heavy rainfall by correlation and composite analysis. The case study on 18 July 2013 shows that stronger Balkhash Lake ridge, weaker Baikal Lake trough, and weaker western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) are favorable to formation of TPMV over the Sichuan basin (SCB); otherwise, weaker Balkhash Lake ridge, stronger Baikal Lake trough, and stronger WPSH result in formation of TPMV to west of the SCB slightly. After the initial time, forecast for next 48 h of the geopotential height over the SCB can be viewed as a precursor of the subsequent time-averaged 90-108 h forecast of TPMV. TPMV had critical contributions to the heavy rainfall over the SCB on 18 July 2013.

The Bee-Eater zone appears to be associated with a band of loess, defined by Scheidig on his 1934 map as second-order loess. Bee-eaters are known to favour loess for nesting tunnels and it appears that the 15 degrees N material is sufficiently loess-like. Obvious sources for particulate materials for the 15 degrees N band are the Fonta-Djalon highlands which supply sedimentary material to the River Niger; the Bodele Depression, the deepest part of Lake Megachad, source of dust for the World; the Ethiopian highlands at the eastern end of 15 degrees N which supply silt to the Nile system and particulates to the 15 degrees N region. In soil moisture terms the region is ustic, which is possibly a necessary condition for bee-eater nests. The clastic material requires an ustic environment. The River Niger can be seen as a loess river; in some senses a mirror-image of a major loess river like the Danube; but where a restricted range of particle inputs leads to a restricted range of loess deposit outputs. Nevertheless loess river considerations can be applied. The Niger delivers second-order loess and an important loessic admixture to the landscape. Enough loess for selective nesters like the Carmine Bee-Eaters to build their nest tunnels in it. It seems likely that climate change will cause a change in bee-eater distribution; it seems unlikely that they will abandon their nesting regions, the living and wintering zones may shift.

SAMPLING IN THE GREAT LAKES FOR PHARMACEUTICALS, PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS, AND ENDOCRINE-DISRUPTING SUBSTANCES USING THE PASSIVE POLAR ORGANIC CHEMICAL INTEGRATIVE SAMPLER	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												The passive polar organic chemical integrative sampler in the pharmaceutical configuration (i.e., pharmaceutical-POCIS) was calibrated for sampling at water temperatures of 5, 15 and 25 degrees C to determine the influence of temperature on chemical-specific sampling rates (R-S), thus providing more robust estimates of the time-weighted average concentrations of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and endocrine-disrupting substances (EDS) in surface water. The effect of water temperature and flow on the R-S of these analytes was evaluated in the laboratory with a static system. The loss of the test compounds from water by uptake into POCIS was linear over an 8-d period, and these experimental data yielded R-S values in the range of 0.07 to 2.46 L/d across the temperature range for the 30 compounds tested. Water temperature and flow influenced POCIS uptake rates, but these effects were relatively small, which is consistent with the theory for uptake into POCIS samplers. Therefore, under a narrow range of water temperatures and flows, it may not be necessary to adjust the R-S for POCIS. Except for acidic drugs and sulfonamide antibiotics, R-S values were positively correlated with octanol-water partition coefficients (log K-OW) of the test compounds. A linear relationship was also observed between R-S and chromatographic retention times on a C18 reversed-phase column. These observations may provide a rapid method for estimating the R-S of additional chemicals in the POCIS. The application of the R-S to POCIS deployed for one month in Lake Ontario, Canada, during the summers of 2006 and 2008 yielded estimates of PPCP and EDS concentrations that are consistent with conventional concentration measurements of these compounds in Lake Ontario surface water.

E., Jr.			Fish Kills in Florida's Canals, Creeks/Rivers, and Ponds/Lakes	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC PLANT MANAGEMENT												Reports from 637 fish kills that occurred between 1984 and 2002 in Florida canals (n = 264), creeks/rivers (n = 64) and ponds/lakes (n = 309) were examined to assist management agencies that need to understand and respond to fish kill events. Critical investigation of 407 fish kills showed that 75% were caused by probable natural processes, 13% were from unknown causes, and 12% were human-induced. Fish kills occurred in every month of the, year but were most. abundant in summer from June through September as was the abundance of rainfall and warmer water temperatures. Canals, creeks/rivers, and ponds/lakes showed strong significant correlations (p < 0.05) between average monthly rainfall and monthly frequency of fish kills with correlation coefficients of 0.86, 0.73, and 0.72, respectively. The Florida lakes that had fish kills, where water chemistry data were available (n = 25), tended to be alkaline with mean pH and alkalinities of 7.7 and 55 (mg/l as CaCO(3)), respectively. The fish kill lakes were also mostly productive with total phosphorus, total nitrogen, chlorophyll, and Secchi depth averaging 69 mu g/L, 1290 mu g/L, 36 mu g/L, and 1.2 m, respectively. These water chemistry averages were all significantly lower in nearby lakes that experience no fish kills, with the exception of Secchi depth. which was significantly higher (p : 0.05). We recommend that state agencies ill charge of fish populations use resources to systematically investigate all fish kills and maintain reports that call later be merged with ambient limnological data to better understand and potentially predict the occurrences of fish kills.

The superbasin is thought to have been initiated similar to 830 Ma, coevally with the breakup of Rodinia, by a mantle plume centred under the central Adelaide Geosyncline, South Australia. The superbasin is thought to deepen towards the south with the basal sediments mainly sourced from the Arunta Region in the north, and blanketing the crystalline Musgrave Block to the south. Our results suggest that deposition in the Amadeus Basin, the most studied of these intraplate basins that made up the superbasin, began similar to 1040 Ma ago (assembly of Rodinia; about 200 Ma earlier than previously suggested) in association with a mantle plume that formed the Warakurna large igneous province. Moreover, we argue for a two stage opening of the Amadeus Basin, one starting at similar to 1040 and the other at similar to 800 Ma, and a long stratigraphic break(s) within Supersequence 1. The basal units of Supersequence 1 in the southern Amadeus Basin yield detrital zircon U-Pb age populations consistent with derivation from the Musgrave Block, which must have been emergent at the time. Our data support the correlation between the basal Neoproterozoic units of the Amadeus Basin (Heavitree Quartzite and Bitter Springs Formation) and the Succession B in western North America, consistent with paleogeographical reconstructions placing Australia to the west of North America after the assembly of Rodinia and before its breakup. Furthermore, our study brings into question the existence of the Centralian Superbasin because Supersequence 1 sedimentary rocks do not belong to a single depositional system. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	Rodusky, AJ; Sharfstein, B; Jin, KR; East, TL				Rodusky, AJ; Sharfstein, B; Jin, KR; East, TL			Thermal stratification and the potential for enhanced phosphorus release from the sediments in Lake Okeechobee, USA	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												We inferred the potential importance of enhanced phosphorus (P) release from the sediments during periods of thermal stratification in Lake Okeechobee USA, a large, shallow, eutrophic lake. This was accomplished by determining the frequency and duration of thermal stratification, using monitoring data collected during 1997 and 1999, with multiparameter sondes, which were positioned at a weather platform in the center of the lake. We also monitored dissolved oxygen, pH, specific conductance, turbidity and redox potential, to assess if any relationships existed between these variables and thermal stratification. Thermal stratification was infrequent, documented for 42 and 74 total hours, and occurred for an extrapolated period of at least one hour on approximately 18 days or 5% of both years. Thermal stratification occurred almost exclusively during the summer (May - September), and was brief, typically lasting for one to six hours per event, although there was one event during 1999, where 49 continuous hours of thermal stratification were documented. Dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations and redox potential (ORP) measurements collected 0.5 m above the sediment surface suggested that the top of the sediment may not have ever become anoxic and was rarely reducing. Chemical characteristics during periods of thermal stratification, compared to those considered favorable for P release based on previous Lake Okeechobee sediment studies, indicate that thermal stratification is usually insufficiently long for chemical conditions (anoxic or low DO and ORP) to develop above the sediment surface that would enable enhanced P release from the sediments.					east, t/KVY-8260-2024														1040-2381					SEP	2005	21	3					330	337		10.1080/07438140509354438	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438140509354438													WOS:000232563600007

Location and Sampling of Aqueous and Hydrothermal Deposits in Martian Impact Craters	ASTROBIOLOGY												Do large craters on Mars represent sites that contain aqueous and hydrothermal deposits that provide clues to astrobiological processes? Are these materials available for sampling in large craters? Several lines of evidence strongly support the exploration of large impact craters to study deposits important for astrobiology. The great depth of impact craters, up to several kilometers relative to the surrounding terrain, can allow the breaching of local aquifers, providing a source of water for lakes and hydrothermal systems. Craters can also be filled with water from outflow channels and valley networks to form large lakes with accompanying sedimentation. Impact melt and uplifted basement heat sources in craters >50 km in diameter should be sufficient to drive substantial hydrothermal activity and keep crater lakes from freezing for thousands of years, even under cold climatic conditions. Fluid flow in hydrothermal systems is focused at the edges of large planar impact melt sheets, suggesting that the edge of the melt sheets will have experienced substantial hydrothermal alteration and mineral deposition. Hydrothermal deposits, fine-grained lacustrine sediments, and playa evaporite deposits may preserve evidence for biogeochemical processes that occurred in the aquifers and craters. Therefore, large craters may represent giant Petri dishes for culturing preexisting life on Mars and promoting biogeochemical processes. Landing sites must be identified in craters where access to the buried lacustrine sediments and impact melt deposits is provided by processes such as erosion from outflow channels, faulting, aeolian erosion, or excavation by later superimposed cratering events. Very recent gully formation and small impacts within craters may allow surface sampling of organic materials exposed only recently to the harsh oxidizing surface environment.

This network included 15 surface monitoring stations, eight balloon sounding stations (equipped with a mix of rawinsonde, tethersonde, and Airsonde sounding systems), three Doppler radar wind profilers, and four Doppler sodars. Measurements were made from 10 January through 31 March 1990. Data from this network were used to prepare objectively analyzed wind fields, trajectoiies, and streak lines to represent transport of emissions from the NGS, and to prepare isentropic analyses of the data. The results of these meteorological analyses were merged in the form of a computer animation that depicted the streak line analyses along with measurements of perfluorocarbon tracer, SO2, and sulfate aerosol concentrations, as well as visibility measurements collected by an extensive surface monitoring network. These analyses revealed that synoptic-scale circulations associated with the passage of low pressure systems followed by the formation of high pressure ridges accompanied the majority of cases when NGS emittants appeared to be transported to the Grand Canyon. The authors' results also revealed terrain influences on transport within the topography of the study area, especially mesoscale flows inside the Lake Powell basin and along the plain above the Marble Canyon.																			0894-8763					AUG	1999	38	8					1031	1048		10.1175/1520-0450(1999)038<1031:MPATTO>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0450(1999)038<1031:MPATTO>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000082406100002

Analyses of trace metals in water, sediment and fish (Salmo trutta, Oncorhynchus mykiss, Squalius cephalus) samples were conducted either by stripping voltammetry (Zn, Cd, Pb and Cu) or cold vapour atomic absorption spectrometry (Hg). The concentration of dissolved trace metals in water was very low revealing a pristine aquatic environment (averages were, in ng/L: 258 (Zn), 10.9 (Cd), 11.7 (Pb), 115 (Cu) and 1.22 (Hg)). Slightly enhanced concentrations of Cd (up to 50 ng/L) and Zn (up to 900 ng/L) were found in two main water springs and are considered as of natural origin. Observed downstream decrease in concentration of Cd, Zn and Cu in both water and sediments is a consequence of the self-purification process governed by the formation and settling of authigenic calcite. Anthropogenic pressure was spotted only in the Kozjak Lake: Hg concentrations in sediments were found to be up to four times higher than the baseline value, while at two locations, Pb concentrations exceeded even a probable effect concentration. The increase of Hg and Pb was not reflected on their levels in the fish tissues; however, significant correlations were found between Cd level in fish tissues (liver and muscle) and in the water/sediment compartments, while only partial correlations were estimated for Zn and Cu. A high discrepancy between values of potentially bioavailable metal fraction estimated by different modelling programs/models raised the question about the usefulness of these data as a parameter in understanding/relating the metal uptake and their levels in aquatic organism. The aquatic environment of the Plitvice Lakes National Park is characterized, in general, as a clean ecosystem.					; Omanovic, Dario/B-8463-2011; Cukrov, Neven/B-8427-2011	Vukosav, Petra/0000-0002-5946-055X; Omanovic, Dario/0000-0001-5961-0485; Cukrov, Neven/0000-0003-3920-6703; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				MAR	2014	21	5					3826	3839		10.1007/s11356-013-2377-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-013-2377-3								24288066					WOS:000331823000059

Subglacial controls on dynamic thinning at Trinity-Wykeham Glacier, Prince of Wales Ice Field, Canadian Arctic	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Mass loss from glaciers and ice caps represents the largest terrestrial component of current sea level rise. However, our understanding of how the processes governing mass loss will respond to climate warming remains incomplete. This study explores the relationship between surface elevation changes (dh/dt), glacier velocity changes (du/dt), and bedrock topography at the Trinity-Wykeham Glacier system (TWG), Canadian High Arctic, using a range of satellite and airborne datasets. We use measurements of dh/dt from ICESat (2003-2009) and CryoSat-2 (2010-2016) repeat observations to show that rates of surface lowering increased from 4 m yr(-1) to 6 m yr(-1) across the lowermost 10 km of the TWG. We show that surface flow rates at both Trinity Glacier and Wykeham Glacier doubled over 16 years, during which time the ice front retreated 4.45 km. The combination of thinning, acceleration and retreat of the TWG suggests that a dynamic thinning mechanism is responsible for the observed changes, and we suggest that both glaciers have transitioned from fully grounded to partially floating. Furthermore, by comparing the separate glacier troughs we suggest that the dynamic changes are modulated by both lateral friction from the valley sides and the complex geometry of the bed. Further, the presence of bedrock ridges induces crevassing on the surface and provides a direct link for surface meltwater to reach the bed. We observe supraglacial lakes that drain at the end of summer and are concurrent with a reduction in glacier velocity, suggesting hydrological connections between the surface and the bed significantly impact ice flow. The bedrock topography thus has a primary influence on the nature of the changes in ice dynamics observed over the last decade.

The relatively warm and humid climate of the Bolling-Allerod (15-12.9 cal kyr BP) is a generalization, but it seems to show some fluctuations. The time of the Younger Dryas (YD) interrupted the increasing trend of effective moisture in the study region, the climate was cold and relatively dry in the early YD period (12.9-12.0 cal kyr BP), whereas the desert vegetation community appeared around 11.8 cal kyr BP, almost the driest time since the 15 cal kyr BR A sharp increase in effective moisture marked the beginning of the Holocene in the Yili Valley. The early Holocene (10.6-7.6 cal kyr BP) was the wettest time with a developed temperate steppe. A dry climate with desert vegetation arose in the early mid-Holocene (7.6-6.5 cal kyr BP), spanning 1100 years. A second humid phase emerged between 6.5 and 5.2 cal kyr BP, whose vegetation community was represented by temperate steppe. Moisture was reduced again and the climate became drier between 5.2 and 3.3 cal kyr BP when vegetation was dominated by desert steppe in the Yili Valley. Regional comparisons indicate that the moisture changes in Yili Valley were mainly influenced by the North Atlantic Ocean SSTs through the westerlies. The mean position of the Siberian High Pressure cell probably made a great contribution to the drought between 7.6 and 6.5 cal kyr BP. The climate changes were generally consistent between the westerly-dominant central Asia and Asian monsoon regions since the last deglaciation, possibly forced by summer insolation conditions in the Northern Hemisphere.

The imagery collected by Landsat is used for a myriad of applications, from coral reef studies to land management. In order to take advantage of Landsat 7 data, the Enhanced Thematic Mapper+ (ETM+) instrument must be calibrated. This study focuses on the immediate postlaunch calibration verification of the Landsat 7 thermal band (Band 6), specifically so that it can be useful in water resource studies. Two year's worth of thermal calibration results using a combination of underflight data and ground truth show the ETM+ to be extremely stable, though the prelaunch calibration produces an offset of 0.261 W/m(2) sr mum. This paper focuses on the details of the calibration process, including problems faced with ground truth instrumentation. While the technical emphasis in this paper is the calibration of Landsat thermal data, it is presented in the context of the water resource studies for which calibrated thermal data are required. At certain times in the year, water quality in large lakes, particularly the spatial structure of water quality, is driven by temperature of lake waters. During the spring warming, a phenomena called the thermal bar drives the current and sedimentation of large water bodies. A long-term goal of this study is to use thermally driven hydrodynamic models of lake processes to better understand and monitor water quality in large lakes. This paper presents the hydrodynamic model and the relationship between temperature and water quality in the Great Lakes as one example of why high-resolution, well-calibrated data are critical to earth observing.

One approach going beyond classical methods is the unmixing of grain-size distributions. This paper presents a flexible end-member modelling algorithm that is based on eigenspace analysis and considers inherent uncertainties. It has been applied to the detrital grain-size components of lacustrine surface sediment samples of Lake Donggi Cona, Qinghai Province, China. It allows up to five grain-size end-members to be characterised and quantified in an optimal model. An end-member with a major mode in the clay domain accounts for 34% of variance within the grain-size data set. It may represent sedimentation of suspension load from linear and laminar runoff during heavy precipitation events in summer. Three end-members in the fine sand to medium silt domains make up 60% of lacustrine sedimentation. They may represent local to remote aeolian processes that peak in wintertime. A multimodal end-member explaining the remaining 6% of variance may represent further fluvial and littoral dynamics or random fluctuations and measurement errors. Several model runs of different scaling and numbers of end-members provided a suitable way to determine uncertainties inherent to the model. A comparison of 12 different model runs and their respective uncertainties yielded a distinct model of robust end-members. The clay and medium silt end-members are robust features of detrital sedimentation within Lake Donggi Cona. They alone explain 54.4% of total variance in the data. However. no spatial pattern or relation to water depth is found for any of the grain-size end-members. Thus, when past detrital sedimentation at Lake Donggi Cona is reconstructed, a special focus should be on the robust features attributed to aeolian and suspension-related sedimentation processes as well as on effective sediment mixing processes impeding a distinct correlation between grain size and spatial attributes. Further applications of the end-member modelling algorithm to other depositional environments are encouraged to demonstrate its universal applicability. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

J	Appleby, PG				Appleby, PG			Environmental change and atmospheric contamination on Svalbard: sediment chronology	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Sediment cores collected from eight lakes along the western coast of Svalbard as part of a project investigating atmospheric pollution and environmental change in Arctic regions were dated radiometrically using natural ((210) Pb) and artificial ((137) Cs and Am-241) fallout radionuclides. At four sites the sedimentation rates were relatively uniform, and in consequence the Pb-210 dates were relatively unambiguous. At the remaining sites there were irregularities in the Pb-210 activity versus depth profiles, indicating significant variations in the net sediment accumulation rate during the past 120 years. At these sites, there were significant differences between Pb-210 dates calculated using the two standard simple dating models, constant rate of supply (CRS) and constant initial concentration (CIC). In most cases, stratigraphic dates based on the Cs-137 and Am-241 records supported use of the CRS model, though at one site (Ossian Sarsfjellet) the CIC model appeared more appropriate. The irregularities in the Pb-210 records were mainly caused by episodes of accelerated sedimentation due, for example, to inwash or slump events, though at some sites there appears to have been a systematic increase in sediment accumulation rates in recent decades. Sediment accumulation rates were generally lower at the northern sites, and higher at the more southerly locations. Mean sediment accumulation rates varied by an order of magnitude, ranging from 0.002 to 0.050 g cm(-2) y(-1) (0.02-0.10 cm y(-1)). (210) Pb fluxes measured from the core inventories were mostly in the range 34-80 Bq m(-2) y(-1) typical of Arctic sites. Much higher values, recorded at two sites (Birgervatnet and Daltjorna), may be due to significant inputs from the catchments during spring thaw.

J	Negus, MT				Negus, Mary T.			Contribution of lake trout stocked as fry to an adult population in Lake Superior	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Like trout Salvelinus namaycush fry treated with heated water to create thermal marks in their otoliths were stocked at Sve's Reef in Minnesota waters of Lake Superior in 1994, 1995, and 1996. These fish began to reach maturity in 2000, and were vulnerable to annual assessment gill nets set at several locations along the Minnesota shoreline. Captured fish also included fin-clipped lake trout stocked as yearlings, and naturally reproduced (wild) lake trout. Otoliths from 3106 unclipped lake trout were aged and examined for thermal marks from 2000 to 2007, of which 1152 were from the target year classes (1994-1996). Thermal marks were found in otoliths from 64 fish, or 5.6% of those in the target year classes, demonstrating that stocked fry contributed to the adult lake trout population in Minnesota waters. Although numbers of recaptured fish were too low to demonstrate statistically significant differences, higher recapture rates of marked fish at Sve's Reef in fall and spawning assessments suggest that these fish may have imprinted at the stocking location and homed back to this area to spawn. Wild lake trout populations in Lake Superior may be approaching fully rehabilitated levels, but recovery in the lower Great Likes has progressed more slowly, and evidence of success with fry stocking could benefit those populations.

Bodamer			Evaluating factors driving population densities of mayfly nymphs in Western Lake Erie	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Mayfly (Hexagenia spp.) nymphs have been widely used as indicators of water and substrate quality in lakes. Thermal stratification and the subsequent formation of benthic hypoxia may result in nymph mortality. Our goal was to identify potential associations between recent increases in temperature and eutrophication, which exacerbate hypoxic events in lakes, and mayfly populations in Lake Erie. Nymphs were collected during April May 1999-2014. We used wind and temperature data to calculate four measures of thermal stratification, which drives hypoxic events, during summers of 1998-2013. Bottom trawl data collected during August 1998-2013 were used to estimate annual biomass of fishes known to be predators of mayfly nymphs. We used Akaike's Information Criterion to identify the best one- and two-predictor regression models of annual population densities (N/m(2)) of age-1 and age-2 nymphs, in which candidate predictors included the four measures of stratification, predator fish biomass, competition, and population densities of age-2 (for age-1) and age-1 (for age-2) nymphs from the previous year. Densities of both age classes of nymphs declined over the time series. Population densities of age-1 and age-2 nymphs from the previous year best predicted annual population densities of nymphs of both age classes. However, hypoxic conditions (indicated by stratification) and predation both had negative effects on annual population density of mayflies. Compared with predation, hypoxia had an inconsistent effect on annual nymph density. The increases in temperature and eutrophication in Lake Erie, which exacerbate hypoxic events, may have drastic effects on the mayfly populations.

Passive sampling to capture the spatial variability of coarse particles by composition in Cleveland, OH	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Passive samplers deployed at 25 sites for three, week-long intervals were used to characterize spatial variability in the mass and composition of coarse particulate matter (PM10-2.5) in Cleveland, OH in summer 2008. The size and composition of individual particles determined using computer-controlled scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (CCSEM-EDS) was then used to estimate PM10-2.5 concentrations (mu g m(-3)) and its components in 13 particle classes. The highest PM10-2.5 mean mass concentrations were observed at three central industrial sites (35 mu g m(-3), 43 mu g m(-3), and 48 mu g m(-3)) whereas substantially lower mean concentrations were observed to the west and east of this area at suburban background sites (13 mu g m(-3) and 15 mu g m(-3)). PM10-2.5 mass and components associated with steel and cement production (Fe-oxide and Ca-rich) exhibited substantial heterogeneity with elevated concentrations observed in the river valley, stretching from Lake Erie south through the central industrial area and in the case of Fe-oxide to a suburban valley site. Other components (e.g., Si/Al-rich typical of crustal material) were considerably less heterogeneous. This work shows that some species of coarse particles are considerably more spatially heterogeneous than others in an urban area with a strong industrial core. It also demonstrates that passive sampling coupled with analysis by CCSEM-EDS is a useful tool to assess the spatial variability of particulate pollutants by composition. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Yet it is potentially important in estimating gene flow between the now fragmented wildlife habitats and in predicting re-colonization following local extinction events. In this study, we examined the extent to which warthog populations from five localities in Uganda are genetically structured using both mitochondrial control region sequence and microsatellite allele length variation. Four of the localities (Queen Elizabeth, Murchison Falls, Lake Mburo and Kidepo Valley) are national parks with relatively good wildlife protection practices and the other (Luwero), not a protected area, is characterized by a great deal of hunting. In the total sample, significant genetic differentiation was observed at both the mtDNA locus (F-ST = 0.68; P < 0.001) and the microsatellite loci (F-ST = 0.14; P < 0.001). Despite the relatively short geographical distances between populations, significant genetic differentiation was observed in all pair-wise population comparisons at the two marker sets (mtDNA F-ST = 0.21-0.79, P < 0.001; microsatellite F-ST = 0.074-0.191, P < 0.001). Significant heterozygote deficiency was observed at most loci within protected areas while no significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg expectation was observed in the unprotected Luwero population. We explain these results in terms of: (i) a strong philopatry among warthogs, (ii) a Wahlund effect resulting from the sampling regime and (iii) break down of social structure in the disturbed Luwero population.

At all scales of sampling, the distribution was patchy. However, the variations between sampling units were smallest when considering thp smallest sampling grid (30 sampling units in a 0.5 ha area). Positive correlations between densities of most taxa were observed at this scale, indicating that a common set of factors could influence zooplankton patchiness. Physical factors, such as wind-induced currents, strongly influenced the lakewide distribution of zooplankton (43 sampling units in a 42 ha area). The horizontal pattern of each taxon appeared to be linked to its ability to form vertical aggregations. Moreover, offshore-nearshore differences in fecundity of several taxa suggest the action of biotic factors in the horizontal distribution of zooplankton. A higher predation risk in the littoral neighbourhood seems to be the more probable proximate - or ultimate - factor which could explain this pattern. In this small and shallow lake, most factors that can affect distribution of zooplankton are temporally variable and unpredictable. In the absence of automatic and efficient measuring techniques, the realisation of a small number of integrated samples at the level of the whole ecosystem could be a simple and suitable solution to obtain statistically reliable data on zooplankton demography.																			0018-8158					MAR 24	1995	300						205	217		10.1007/BF00024462	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00024462													WOS:A1995RB62500020

The potential for the discovery of hominin remains from this interval is limited by the availability of exposed Pliocene deposits and the ability to investigate them. As a result, most discoveries have been made in the Afar region of Ethiopia and in the Lake Turkana basin, thus unveiling only a portion of Pliocene hominins' probable geographical presence. In this study we provide a continental view of geographic areas potentially accessible to these hominins. To do so, we estimate the climatic envelope suitable for mid-to-late Pliocene hominin presence, using the earth system model IPSL-CM5A and the Maxent habitat suitability algorithm. Our analysis reveals high habitat suitability for these hominin species in semi-arid regions where annual thermal amplitude and mean annual precipitation are moderate, mostly corresponding to tropical xerophytic shrublands. Our habitat model estimates geographically continuous, suitable climatic conditions for hominins between central Sahel and northeastern Africa, but not between eastern and southern Africa. This discontinuity suggests that southern African and eastern African hominins were separated by an environmental barrier that could only be crossed during particularly favourable periods or by undertaking long-range dispersal over climatically hostile habitats. Under climate conditions of northern hemisphere summer at perihelion this climatic barrier is not present. In contrast, the Turkana basin, the Laetoli region, and a large part of southern Africa remain suitable for all precession angles, suggesting that these areas may have functioned as refugia. The constant presence of these stable areas combined with the periodic establishment of corridors for dispersion can potentially explain hominin diversity in eastern Africa.					; Barboni, Doris/A-6908-2010; Banks, William E./H-3494-2019; fluteau, frederic/A-7523-2011; Banks, William/H-3494-2019; Otero, Olga/T-5467-2018; Souron, Antoine/ACG-5680-2022; Sepulchre, Pierre/Q-2006-2017; Fluteau, Frederic/A-7523-2011	Chavasseau, Olivier/0000-0001-8638-4583; Vignoles, Anais/0000-0001-5027-2037; Barboni, Doris/0000-0001-7753-1254; GUY, Franck/0000-0001-7032-7963; Banks, William E./0000-0003-1835-6315; fluteau, frederic/0000-0002-9952-7325; Gibert Bret, Corentin/0000-0002-6141-3832; Otero, Olga/0000-0002-8129-2054; 													0921-8181	1872-6364				MAR	2022	210								103756	10.1016/j.gloplacha.2022.103756	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2022.103756		FEB 2022											WOS:000820173300003

Increased Benthic Algal Primary Production in Response to the Invasive Zebra Mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) in a Productive Ecosystem, Oneida Lake, New York	JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE PLANT BIOLOGY												Increased water clarity associated with zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) populations may favor benthic algal primary production in freshwater systems previously dominated by pelagic phytoplankton production. While zebra mussel-mediated water clarity effects on benthic primary production have been implicated in published reports, few production estimates are available. This study estimates benthic primary production in Oneida Lake, NY before and after zebra mussel invasion (1992), using measured photosynthetic parameters (P-max(B),alpha(B) and beta) from sampled benthic algal communities. In the summers of 2003 and 2004, primary production was measured as O-2 evolution from algal communities on hard (cobble) and soft (sediment) substrate from several depths. We also backcast estimates of benthic primary production from measurements of light penetration since 1975. Estimates of whole-lake epipelic and epilithic algal primary production showed a significant (4%) increase and exhibited significantly less interannual variability subsequent to the establishment of zebra mussels. We applied our model to two lakes of differing trophic status; the model significantly overestimated benthic primary production in a hypereutrophic lake, but there was no significant difference between the actual and predicted primary production values in the oligotrophic lake. The hypereutrophic lake had higher zebra mussel densities than Oneida (224 vs. 41 per sample respectively). Though total community respiration (measured in total darkness) was factored into our model predictions of production, our model may need modification when heterotrophic respiration is a large portion of total community metabolism.

J	Yaltirak, C; Alpar, B				Yaltirak, C; Alpar, B			Evolution of the middle strand of North Anatolian Fault and shallow seismic investigation of the southeastern Marmara Sea (Gemlik Bay)	MARINE GEOLOGY												The Gemlik Bay is developed as a pull-apart basin during the late Pliocene-early Pleistocene mainly controlled by west-trending dextral strike-slip faults along the middle strand of the North Anatolian Fault zone, with the NW-trending Thrace-Eskisehir Fault playing secondary role. The North Anatolian Fault reached the eastern Marmara Sea similar to 3.5 Ma ago, where its middle strand intersected the Thrace-Eskisehir Fault. GPS slip vectors measured on the Armutlu and Mudanya blocks show a displacement of 7-8 km during the last 3.5 Ma. The middle strand of the North Anatolian Fault zone has lower tectonic activity than the northern strand. Because uplift of the southeast Marmara Sea region has been continuous since the late Pliocene, the presence of fluviatile, lacustrine and deltaic environments in the Gemlik pull-apart basin over the same period supports a lower lever of tectonic activity. The transgressive Marmara Formation was deposited on top of these fluvio-lacustrine deposits following the Mediterranean inundation at similar to 600 ka via the Strait of Canakkale. The Gemlik basin was affected both by two major sea-level falls at 160-132 and 24-11 ka, and minor short-lived sea-level variations, as a result of becoming a lacustrine setting five times since similar to 600 ka. During these lowstands, stacked delta successions were deposited around the lake and on the transgressed shelves of the Marmara Sea. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The main cases of hybridization in the wild have been cited and analyzed. These wild hybrids are arranged in three categories: those that come from species transfert, those that occur after manmade changes in the environment and finally those that are truly natural. The majority of the natural hybridization cases reported belong in the first category. In Lake Naivasha in Kenya where Oreochromis spilurus nigra and O. leucostictus were introduced in the 1950's, in Lake Bunyoni in Uganda where O. niloticus was introduced in 1927 from Lake Edward and O. spilurus nigra in 1932 from Lake Naivasha; in Lake Itasy, in Madagascar, where O. macrochir was introduced in 1958 and O. niloticus in 1961; in Lake Ihema in Rwanda, where O. macrochir was introduced near the end of the 1960's, after the introduction of O. niloticus near the end of the 1940's; finally, in Lake Victoria where O. niloticus was introduced in the 1960's and where O. variabilis and O. esculentus have disappeared. Hybridization among Tilapia zillii and T. guineensis in Cote d'lvoire is an example of hybridization following manmade perturbations in the environment (damming). The last hybridization case presented occurs below the Koroboue Falls on the Comoe. River. It has happened between three species: T. zillii, T. guineensis and T. dageti: It is the only case of hybridization where the hand of man is not suspected of involvement.					; Agnèse, jean-François/J-8302-2016	Laurent, Pouyaud/0000-0003-4415-9198; 													0767-2896		2-7099-1390-9				1998							95	+																WOS:000074346400006

Habitats that are essential as fish spawning and nursery sites are critical, and must be identified for conservation purposes. Littoral zones within Patagonian lakes, especially shallow vegetated areas, represent important areas for the Creole perch, Percichthys trucha. Spawning behaviour has been little studied, so it is not known whether these movements are performed in groups. A particular area of a deep lake in northern Patagonia was studied to identify the environmental conditions under which spawning occurs, and to analyse spawning aggregation behaviour in relation to the lunar cycle. To identify spawning sites, spawning occurrence time, and the environmental parameters that determine it, fish capture data were analysed. Underwater cameras were also set up at three depth strata in the shallow zone to detect spawning aggregation behaviour. Aggregation was scored as the greatest number of individuals present in a single frame, and the number present per depth stratum. The relationship between the lunar cycle and Creole perch abundance by depth was then determined. This is the first visual record of a spawning bed and the spawning aggregation behaviour of Creole perch in Patagonian lakes. The abundance of mature Creole perch in the shallow strata during the austral spring suggests that vegetated areas constitute spawning sites. Spawning aggregation takes place at a shallow depth 2 days before the full moon. As the reproductive behaviours of Creole perch are important phenomena in the life history of the species, the results of this study have important implications for conservation and management.					; Sosnovsky, Alejandro/AAD-4982-2022; Zattara, Eduardo/A-3760-2012	Milano, Daniela/0000-0002-0542-5863; Fernandez, Maria Valeria/0000-0001-8075-1215; Sosnovsky, Alejandro/0000-0001-8615-389X													1052-7613	1099-0755				NOV	2021	31	11					3248	3260		10.1002/aqc.3705	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aqc.3705		SEP 2021											WOS:000693846500001

They occur dominantly in horizontal layers with aggradational and progradational stacking patterns. Their fabrics and morphologies are remarkably similar to the shrubs lithotypes reported in literature for the Pre-Salt reservoirs, offshore Brazil and Angola, with huge oil accumulations. Petrographic and micro-computer tomography analyses allowed the identification of six shrub morpho-types (i.e., narrow dendriform, wide dendriform, fili dendriform, arborescent, arbustiform and pustular). Dendriform shrubs are the most common lithotype in Tivoli area, and three different subtypes could be distinguished according to the arrangement of their branches. The shrubs consist largely of peloidal micritic, aggregates engulfed in spar calcite, ranging in average from 1 to 3 cm in height. The shrubs are interpreted to have developed in very shallow extensive waterlogged slightly inclined flat areas, changing laterally into a slope system with crusts as the main lithotype. Changes in the hydrodynamic conditions with episodes of stagnancy influenced the shrub morpho-types making them very variegated. Shrub morphologies likely reflect specific (micro-) environments that are controlled by water flow rates, evaporation and microbial activity. The latter processes influenced shrub fabric and morphology. Under high flow conditions, CO2 degassing is the main process leading to carbonate precipitation. Consequently, denser and tightly packed morphologies will precipitate, composing mainly the crust lithotype. In this scenario microbes are less dominant. Dendriform shrubs, with narrow, wide and fili morphologies are interpreted to occur in moderate to low energy water flows. Narrow dendriform shrubs reflect faster flowing conditions, with decreasing impact of flow on the morphological aspects from wide dendriform shrubs to fili dendriform shrubs. Slow to very slow flowing waters are more characteristic for the arborescent, arbustiform and pustular shrubs that possibly are highly influenced by evaporation. A decrease of water flow likely allows higher microbial activity, and consequently, shrub morphologies become more fragile and enriched in peloidal micritic aggregate fabrics. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Free, CM; Jensen, OP; Mendsaikhan, B				Free, Christopher M.; Jensen, Olaf P.; Mendsaikhan, Bud			A Mixed-Method Approach for Quantifying Illegal Fishing and Its Impact on an Endangered Fish Species	PLOS ONE												Illegal harvest is recognized as a widespread problem in natural resource management. The use of multiple methods for quantifying illegal harvest has been widely recommended yet infrequently applied. We used a mixed-method approach to evaluate the extent, character, and motivations of illegal gillnet fishing in Lake Hovsgol National Park, Mongolia and its impact on the lake's fish populations, especially that of the endangered endemic Hovsgol grayling (Thymallus nigrescens). Surveys for derelict fishing gear indicate that gillnet fishing is widespread and increasing and that fishers generally use 3-4 cm mesh gillnet. Interviews with resident herders and park rangers suggest that many residents fish for subsistence during the spring grayling spawning migration and that some residents fish commercially year-round. Interviewed herders and rangers generally agree that fish population sizes are decreasing but are divided on the causes and solutions. Biological monitoring indicates that the gillnet mesh sizes used by fishers efficiently target Hovsgol grayling. Of the five species sampled in the monitoring program, only burbot (Lota lota) showed a significant decrease in population abundance from 2009-2013. However, grayling, burbot, and roach (Rutilus rutilus) all showed significant declines in average body size, suggesting a negative fishing impact. Data-poor stock assessment methods suggest that the fishing effort equivalent to each resident family fishing 50-m of gillnet 11-15 nights per year would be sufficient to over-exploit the grayling population. Results from the derelict fishing gear survey and interviews suggest that this level of effort is not implausible.

However, studies about high resolution dynamics of dissolved CO2 in different types of lakes over daily or weekly time scales are still very scarce. We measured summertime vertical DO and CO2 profiles at sub-hourly intervals during one week in eight Estonian lakes representing different lake types according to European Water Framework Directive. The lakes showed considerable differences in thermal stratification and vertical distribution of dissolved oxygen and CO2 as well as different diurnal dynamics over the measurement period. We observed a continuous CO2 supersaturation in the upper mixed layer of the alkalitrophic (calcareous groundwaterfed) lake and the dark soft-water lake showing them as CO2 emitting "chimneys" although with different underlying mechanisms. In three lake types strong undersaturation with CO2 occurred in the surface layer characterising them as CO2 sinks for the measurement period while in another three types the surface layer CO2 was mostly in equilibrium with the atmosphere. Factor analysis showed that DO% in the surface layer and the strength of its relationship with CO2% were positively related to alkalinity and negatively to trophic state and DOC gradients, whereas deeper lakes were characterised by higher surface concentration but smaller spatial and temporal variability of CO2. Multiple regression analysis revealed lake area, maximum depth and the light attenuation coefficient as variables affecting the largest number of gas regime indicators. We conclude that the trophic status of lakes in combination with type specific features such as morphometry, alkalinity and colour (DOC) determines the distribution and dynamics of dissolved CO2 and DO, which therefore may indicate functional differences in carbon cycling among lakes.

Organic matter governs N and P balance in Danube Delta lakes	AQUATIC SCIENCES												The transformation of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and soluble reactive phosphorous (SRP), and the release of dissolved organic and particulate N and P, were analyzed in two lake complexes (Uzlina-Isac and Puiu-Rosu-Rosulet) of the Danube Delta wetland during flood conditions in May and at low water level in September 2006. The Uzlina-Isac complex was hydrologically tightly-connected with the Danube River and was flushed with river-borne nutrients and organic matter. These lakes acted as effective transformers for nutrients and produced large amounts of fresh biomass, that promoted the excretion of dissolved organic N and P during active growth. Biomass breakdown created particulate matter (< 0.45 mu m), which was widely liberated during low flow in the fall. The Puiu-Rosu-Rosulet complex was characterized by a more distant position to the Danube and proximity to the Black Sea, and received dominantly transformed organic compounds from the flow-through water and vast vegetation cover. Due to reduced nutrient input, the internal production of organic biomass also was reduced in these more remote lakes. Total N and P export from the lake nearest to the shelf was governed by dominantly dissolved organic and particulate compounds (mean 58 and 82%, respectively). Overall, this survey found that these highly productive wetlands efficiently transform nutrients into a large pool of dissolved organic and particulate N and P. Hence, wetland lakes may behave widely as net sources of organic N and P to downstream waters and coastal marine systems.

J	Ziegler, S; Benner, R				Ziegler, S; Benner, R			Effects of solar radiation on dissolved organic matter cycling in a subtropical seagrass meadow	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The influence of sunlight on bacterioplankton production was investigated over a 12-month period in Laguna Madre, a shallow, subtropical, seagrass-dominated lagoon in south Texas. Two types of experiments were conducted every 6 to 8 weeks from June 1996 through June 1997 to assess the effect of photochemical transformations of dissolved organic matter (DOM) on bacterial production and the net effect of sunlight exposure on bacterioplankton and phytoplankton production in surface waters. Photobleaching of DOM was observed; however, estimates of the photomineralization of DOM in May and July were very low and indicated that this process could represent at most 3% of water column respiration. Photochemical transformations of DOM did not have any significant effect on bacterioplankton activity. However, bacterial production measured during exposure of water samples to natural sunlight in the summer months, with and without ultraviolet light, was enhanced relative to dark controls. Phytoplankton release of bioavailable substrates appeared to be responsible for light-mediated increases in bacterioplankton production. Bacterio- and phytoplankton were not photoinhibited by exposure to ultraviolet radiation in surface waters. Overall, we observed no indication of photoinhibition of microbial processes in Laguna Madre, and photochemical transformations appeared to play a minor role in the cycling of DOM. The low photoreactivity of DOM in combination with its relatively high bioreactivity appeared responsible for the minor role of photochemical transformations in the cycling of DOM in Laguna Madre.

Watershed, lake, and food web factors influence diazotrophic cyanobacteria in mountain lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Cyanobacterial blooms can occur in freshwater ecosystems largely isolated from development and not experiencing extensive cultural eutrophication. For example, remote mountain lakes can experience intense blooms of diazotrophic (nitrogen-fixing) cyanobacteria caused by factors acting at different spatial and temporal scales. In this study, we examined how cross-scale interactions among watershed, lake, and food web characteristics influence diazotrophic cyanobacteria biovolume in mountain lakes. We quantified diazotrophic cyanobacteria biovolume, zooplankton abundance, and physico-chemical variables for 29 lakes in the Cascade Mountains of Oregon, USA, in summer 2019. Watershed characteristics were compiled from historical datasets available for the region. Diazotrophic cyanobacteria biovolume ranged across the lakes from 0 to 1,930,000 mu m3 mL-1; Dolichospermum was the most common genus. Random forest models showed that 11 watershed, lake, and food web characteristics explained 76% of the variance in diazotrophic cyanobacteria biovolume among the sampled lakes. Structural equation models suggested that the drainage ratio (i.e., the relative area of the lake to the watershed) was positively related to phosphorus concentrations and, in turn, to diazotroph biovolume. Among lakes, hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen was negatively correlated with diazotroph biovolume, possibly due to the release of nutrients, like phosphate and iron, bound to sediments. In addition, zooplankton grazers were negatively related to diazotrophic cyanobacteria biovolume, potentially reflecting the influence of stocked fish. Thus, lake management must account for bottom-up factors, such as nutrient loading, which is influenced by lake morphometry and watershed size, as well as top-down factors, such as fish stocking, to effectively mitigate diazotrophic cyanobacterial blooms.

Here, a 4-months survey was carried out during summertime to monitor planktonic microbial communities of nine lakes located around Paris (Ile-de-France, France) of comparable morphologies, yet distinct trophic statuses from mesotrophic to hypereutrophic. By thus minimizing the confounding factors, we investigated how trophic status could influence prokaryotic community structures (16S rRNA gene sequencing) and functions (shotgun metagenomics). These freshwater lakes harbored highly distinct and diverse prokaryotic communities, and their trophic status appears as the main driver explaining both differences in community structure and functional potential. Although their gene pool was quite stable and shared among lakes, taxonomical and functional changes were correlated. According to trophic status, differences in phosphorus metabolism-related genes were highlighted among the relevant functions involved in the biogeochemical cycles. Overall, hypereutrophic lakes microbiomes displayed the highest contrast and heterogeneity over time, suggesting a specific microbial regime shift compared to eutrophic and mesotrophic lakes.

In this 5E standards-based inquiry lesson, students actively engage with the natural phenomena of algal blooms through the introduction of the harmful algal bloom (HAB) that occurred in Lake Erie's western basin in the summer of 2011. Students make sense of relationships within aquatic ecosystems, using microcosms (miniature ecosystems) containing phytoplankton and zooplankton, and then communicate their findings through a scientific manuscript. This lesson engages students in the three-dimensional learning identified in the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) under the standard of HSLS2, Ecosystems: Interactions, Energy, and Dynamics. More specifically, students address the expectation of HS-LS2-6 when they make sense of how the complex interactions in ecosystems maintain relatively consistent numbers and types of organisms in stable conditions, while changing conditions may result in new ecosystems. This long-term scientific investigation also provides students with opportunities to make sense of aspects of the nature of science, while increasing their science content knowledge and understanding of the practices of science. Evaluation of student work occurs at all stages of the lesson.																			0002-7685	1938-4211				MAR	2023	85	3					147	158		10.1525/abt.2023.85.3.147	http://dx.doi.org/10.1525/abt.2023.85.3.147													WOS:000963121200005

Short-Term Variability of Nutrients and Fecal Indicator Bacteria within the Gold Coast Seaway, Southern Moreton Bay (Australia)	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Significant urban development surrounding the Gold Coast Broadwater and upper catchment has resulted in concerns about degrading water quality of the estuarine system. The Gold Coast Seaway plays an important role in the exchange of estuarine and oceanic waters influencing the intertidal waters of the region. Water quality within the Gold Coast Seaway and the immediately adjacent Broadwater was investigated three times at three sample depths at 13 sample locations. Conductivity, temperature, and depth casts, total (nitrogen and phosphorus) and dissolved inorganic (NOx and NH4+) nutrients, and fecal indicator bacteria were measured at hourly intervals to compare the water quality under different tidal conditions at each location. Hydrological data were also collected. From these measurements, the intratidal variability of the Seaway waters was determined. Observed current velocities ranged from 0.001 to 0.909 m s(-1) and 0.018 to 1.8 m s(-1) during neap and spring tide periods, respectively. Physical parameters and nutrient concentrations demonstrated typical cyclic variations, with the influence of tidal and diurnal cycles apparent. Near minimum and maximum concentrations were generally observed at high and low water, respectively, indicating the influence of oceanic water during flood tides and catchment waters during ebb tides. Significant correlations were observed between surface water salinity values and total nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations. Fecal coliforms and Enterococcus spp. concentrations were low (<60 colony-forming units per 100 mL(-1)), with no significant trends apparent between concentration and sample location, depth, or tidal phase.

With reference to the parameters population size, age structure, sex and health conditions, 2 lakes (0.6 and 3.2 ha) were found to have large and reproducing populations (6,747 and 21,938 individuals), while 1 lake (3.8 ha) had a very small population (55 individuals) with no sign of reproduction. Distribution of juveniles and adults within the lakes depended on habitat types and macrophyte species. The genetic structure of the crayfish stocks in Brandenburg was analysed and compared with that of reference stocks in Bavaria and Schleswig-Holstein using RAPD-PCR. Three random primers revealed a total of 51 bands. Each stock could be identified as a distinct population. Differences between the Brandenburg populations and the reference populations were higher than within the Brandenburg populations. From these results it can be assumed that the stocks in Brandenburg are autochthonous. This situation must be taken into account in conservation and restocking projects. The results suggest further studies and improvements in conservation strategies and in the culture and restocking of crayfish in Northeastern Germany.																					3-8289-3403-X				1998							387	395																WOS:000168192200032
J	Livingstone, DM				Livingstone, DM			Break-up dates of Alpine lakes as proxy data for local and regional mean surface air temperatures	CLIMATIC CHANGE												The calendar date of ice break-up on Lej da San Murezzan, a high-altitude (1768 m a.s.l.) lake in the Swiss Alps, has been recorded uninterruptedly since 1832. Based on this record and on shorter interrupted records from two neighbouring lakes, the potential use of the timing of spring break-up as a proxy for local and regional surface air temperatures in the European Alpine region is investigated. Lej da San Murezzan exhibits an overall trend to earlier thawing (7.6 days per century) comparable to that of lakes in other parts of the Northern Hemisphere. Part of this trend may be due to shifts in mean break-up date around 1857 and 1932. The timing of break-up on all three lakes is strongly related to local and regional surface air temperatures centred an the middle of April and integrated over 4-8 weeks. Three empirical methods of relating break-up date to local air temperature yielded essentially the same proportion of shared variance (about 64%). Comparisons of break-up dates with surface air temperature data from Switzerland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom suggest that the thawing of Alpine lakes is determined to a large extent by synoptic-scale meteorological processes. The timing of break-up on Lej da San Murezzan also tends to follow an index of global explosive volcanism with a time lag of about two years, volcanically quiescent periods being associated with early break-up, and volcanically active periods with late break-up. This suggests that modulation of incident radiation by stratospheric aerosols of volcanic origin may significantly affect the timing of break-up of high-altitude lakes.																			0165-0009	1573-1480				OCT	1997	37	2					407	439		10.1023/A:1005371925924	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1005371925924													WOS:A1997XZ62800007
J	Horn, H; Horn, W				Horn, Heidemarie; Horn, Wolfgang			Bottom-up or top-down - How is the autotrophic picoplankton mainly controlled? Results of long-term investigations from two drinking water reservoirs of different trophic state	LIMNOLOGICA												In two reservoirs of different trophic state, the abundance of autotrophic picoplankton was continuously assessed for 7 and 11 years, respectively. Simultaneously, other important environmental and biotic factors (nutrients, temperature, phyto- and zooplankton) were analysed. The mesotrophic Saidenbach Reservoir receives five- to sevenfold higher phosphorus imports, and exhibits twice higher phosphorus contents, and tenfold higher phytoplankton concentrations than the oligotrophic Neunzehnhain Reservoir. Despite these differences, the quantities and dynamics of autotrophic picoplankton (APP) showed remarkable similarities in both reservoirs. The APP consisted almost exclusively of Phycoerythrin-rich cyanobacteria. A notable growth of cyanobactcria never started before the onset of stratification and finished no later than the beginning of the autumnal turnover. Although the soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentrations in the epilimnion were always near the limit of detection, there was no evidence for growth restriction of APP by nutrients in either of the reservoirs. However, the data reveal a strong grazing impact of all potential grazers, especially of the daphnids. This zooplankton group always showed a strict behaviour opposite of the APP during its growth periods. The grazing influence of rotifers and protozoans is less pronounced but also obvious, notable by the frequently observed inverse relationships between their quantities and those of APP. It is assumed that during the stratification period in the summer the APP dynamics is mainly top-down controlled. (C) 2008 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Differences in habitat availability and lake water quality may also contribute to variation in juvenile river herring productivity between populations, yet these relationships have not been tested across a large geographic scope. In this study we investigated relationships between juvenile river herring densities and (1) spawning adult river herring densities, (2) lake habitat availability, and (3) lake water quality in 29 freshwater lakes in the northeastern USA. Purse seines were used at night to sample juvenile river herring monthly in June-August 2014 and 2015, with concurrent collection of lake-specific physical (e.g., lake surface area, mean depth, depth to thermocline), chemical (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus, dissolved organic carbon [DOC]), and biological (chlorophyll a, adult spawning density) data. Spawning adult density (number of adults per surface area of lake) explained 66.6% of the variation in juvenile densities using a generalized additive model. Juvenile densities increased with increasing adult density, peaking at roughly 1,000 adults/ha, and then declined at higher adult densities, suggesting a limit to carrying capacity in juvenile production. Linear mixed-effects models revealed that differences in water quality and habitat across lakes explained additional variation in juvenile densities. Specifically, DOC was negatively related to juvenile densities, suggesting that DOC limits the amount of suitable, well-oxygenated epilimnion habitat available to juvenile river herring in late summer. Our results can be used to help understand expected juvenile production based on adult density within a lake, to inform expectations about juvenile growth and survival, and to understand the mechanisms for how changes in habitat availability and water quality affect river herring populations.

Once they became protected in 1916, their numbers increased throughout eastern North America, reaching a maximum of 875,000 breeding pairs around 1990. Since then, an overall decline of 19% has been recorded in the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River while their numbers tripled in Atlantic Canada. The largest concentrations are still found on the Great Lakes with 38% and 42% of the birds breeding in Canada and the USA, respectively. The remaining individuals breed along the St. Lawrence River (15%), on Lake Champlain (2%), and in the Gulf of St. Lawrence including the Atlantic Provinces and Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon (3%). In 2009, a study was undertaken in the largest colony located on Ile Deslauriers near Montreal, Quebec, to determine the factors that regulate the number of breeding birds. This colony supported 52,000 pairs in 2000 and 44,000 in 2012. Ring-billed Gulls had a lower reproductive output in 2010-2012 compared to the late 1970s attributed to reduced chick survival. The number of gull-days at the nearest landfill declined from 906,000 in 1995 to 40,000 in 2012 following the implementation of a falconry deterrence program. Limited access to an abundant food supply located near the colony may have reduced chick survival. How this affects annual survival and population size remains to be determined. In the long term, policies that aim to reduce input of organic matter at landfills and discourage citizens from feeding gulls could further contribute to the decline of Ring-billed Gulls in eastern North America.					; Giroux, Jean-François/L-7945-2019	Patenaude-Monette, Martin/0000-0001-7272-2115; 													1524-4695	1938-5390				APR	2016	39				1		87	98		10.1675/063.039.sp101	http://dx.doi.org/10.1675/063.039.sp101													WOS:000379882900010
J	Cheng, CH; Nnadi, F				Cheng, Chi-Han; Nnadi, Fidelia			Water Budget on Various Land Use Areas Using NARR Reanalysis Data in Florida	ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY												1992 to 2002 data from North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) were used to investigate water budget on five land use areas: urban, forest, agriculture, lake, and wetland in the state of Florida, USA. The data were evaluated based on the anomalies of rainfall, evaporation, and soil moisture from the average condition. The anomalies were used to investigate the effect of extreme conditions on water budget parameters for various land uses in both northeast and south of Florida. The results showed that extreme events such as La Nina strongly affected the water budget on land-use areas in both regions as the negative monthly rainfall anomalies were observed during the 1999-2000 event, while EI Nino and thunderstorms in summer caused positive rainfall anomalies with more than 70% in all study areas. Higher rainfall led to higher soil moisture anomalies for the agriculture, forest, and wetland from 1992 to May 1998 in both study regions. However, soil moisture becomes primary source for evaporation in drier conditions, and differences in capacity of plants access water, often dictated by the rooting depth, can result in contrasting evaporative losses across vegetation types. Hence, the forest, which had the deeper roots, had lower soil moisture anomalies, but higher evaporation anomalies than agriculture area during the drought event.

It also presents the data of the comprehensive assessment of the quality of the surface water and bottom deposits of the water area and western shore of Baikal which was conducted in the summer of 2016-2017. The study of the hydrochemical composition of the Baikal water has been conducted in the course of the research as well as of the following Tazheran lakes: Tyzgyi-Nur, Kholbo-Nur, Shadar-Nur, Tsagan-Tyrym. It has been established that, based on the content of microcomponents, the still and weakly alkaline waters of Lake Baikal meet the standards of the maximum allowable concentrations (MAC) established for water bodies used for fishing and household purposes. The waters of the lakes refer to the hydrocarbonate type, calcium group. Based on their sum of ion, the lakes of Tyzgyi-Nur, Kholbo-Nur, Shadar-Nur and Tsagan-Tyrym refer to the brackish type, the waters of these lakes mostly have the hydrocarbonate and magnesium content with a predominance of sulfate ion. The levels of the content of heavy metals (V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu) in the water and bottom deposits have also been identified.

Salinity, a key parameter of watermass conditions in coastal areas, plays a crucial role in influencing nutrient availability, stratification, and the spatial-temporal distribution of redox conditions. Here, we focus on the cyclostratigraphic analysis of gamma-ray (GR) data obtained from Eocene strata in the Luo-69 drillcore from the Bohai Bay Basin (NE China). This analysis establishes a high-resolution astronomical time scale (ATS) for the lower third member of the Shahejie Formation (Es3l), spanning 39.04 Ma to 41.46 million years ago (Ma). Various proxies for watermass conditions, such as salinity, sedimentary structures, mineral content, total organic carbon (TOC), organic carbon isotopes and nitrogen isotopes (delta C-13(org) and delta N-15), exhibit a strong correlation with 405-kyr long orbital eccentricity climate forcing. Notably, spectral analysis of salinity data (represented by the Sr/Ba proxy) reveals a clear astronomical control, with 405-kyr eccentricity cycles that align closely with variations in the GR data. Peaks in paleosalinity, as indicated by Sr/Ba (as well as B/Ga and S/TOC), correspond with maxima in 405kyr long orbital eccentricity cycles in the GR data. As such, we infer that astronomical forcing regulated longterm changes in watermass conditions, likely through mediation of the East Asia monsoon system. Specifically, during eccentricity maxima, the basin would have experienced a warm and humid climate with pronounced seasonality and a robust summer monsoon. During such periods, increased continental runoff would lead to a rise in lake-levels, facilitating better connections with the ocean, and hence increased salinity. By contrast, during eccentricity minima, cooler and more arid conditions with weaker seasonality would result in lower lake levels which together with a global eustatic lowstand would result in as weakened connection with the open ocean restricting the ingress of seawater into the basin lowering salinity. Our dataset spans the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum (MECO, similar to 40.60-40.10 Ma), identified by elevated GR values and a conspicuous negative excursion in oxygen isotopes. This interval is characterized by a significant decline in salinity, likely attributed to enhanced freshwater runoff driven by an extremely warm and humid climate. The paleosalinity fluctuation recorded by the proxies B/Ga, Sr/Ba, and S/TOC in Bohai Bay Basin demonstrate the sensitivity of marginal-marine environment to subtle changes in climate driven by astronomical forcing. Our results provide new insights into how elemental salinity proxies can be utilized in paleoenvironmental reconstruction studies.

Links between introduced fish and zooplanktonic and zoobenthic food sources in the food webs of two reservoirs of a semi-arid zone in Algeria	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												Few studies have focused on the trophic functioning of the reservoirs in Algeria. The study of the gut contents of fish species, as well as the analysis of the stable isotopes of(13)C and(15)N in the environment, were carried out on samples collected during spring 2010 in two reservoirs: Ghrib and Harreza of the upper Cheliff plain (Algeria) within a semi-arid climate zone. In each of the reservoirs,C-13 and(15)N were measured in sediments, particulate organic matter (POM), macrophytes, zooplankton, zoobenthos and fish. The isotopic analysis shows that the carbon values that supply both reservoirs, Ghrib and Harreza, were -31.16 +/- 0.05 <C-13 < -18.01 +/- 0.21 parts per thousand and -30.82 +/- 0.07 <C-13 < -17.24 +/- 3.50 parts per thousand, respectively. The carnivorous fishSander lucioperca, andAbramis brama, an omnivorous fish, were allocated to the top of the food web in Ghrib and Harreza reservoirs, respectively. In the latter, a reservoir with low hydrodynamism and depth, the food web is simpler with a single fish species, which benefits from both benthic and pelagic sources. In Ghrib, a deeper dam with stronger hydrodynamics, only the riverine crabPotamon algerienseexploits the benthic sources, whereas fish mainly feed on zooplankton.					mortillaro, Jean-Michel/A-2496-2012; Meziane, Tarik/AAF-7906-2020; DJEZZAR, Miliani/ISB-9469-2023	Miliani, DJEZZAR/0000-0002-3149-3050; MEZIANE, Tarik/0000-0003-2142-6441; Mortillaro, Jean-Michel/0000-0003-1911-9338													1608-5914	1727-9364				JAN 2	2021	46	1					33	44		10.2989/16085914.2020.1787124	http://dx.doi.org/10.2989/16085914.2020.1787124		SEP 2020											WOS:000568906900001

This is due to the scarcity of relatively continuous sedimentary records with high-resolution chronological controls in this hyper-arid region. To address this gap, a new sedimentary record was drilled from Yitang Lake in the Dunhuang Basin of NW China, and used to reconstruct the long history of regional hydroclimatic changes since the Late Pleistocene. A comprehensive high-resolution geochronology of the upper part of the drilling core indicates a significant sedimentary hiatus between approximately 100 ka and 23 ka, likely due to the dry and harsh environmental conditions during the Last Glacial period (MIS 4 to MIS 2). Since then, the study area has experienced a relatively dry Late Glacial period (similar to 23-11 ka), gradually wetter early Holocene (similar to 11-8 ka), and moist mid-Holocene (similar to 8-5 ka), followed by a drying trend after approximately 5 ka. Hydrological variations in this area since the Late Quaternary were mainly controlled by changes in precipitation and glacier meltwater from the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. These alterations were ultimately regulated by shifts in atmospheric circulation patterns, as well as the dynamic interplay between the westerlies and the East Asian summer monsoon at both orbital and suborbital scales.

The emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis), a wood-boring beetle native to South-East Asia, was first reported in the Great Lakes region during summer 2002. The beetle poses an enormous threat to native ash (Fraxinus) species of North America, as untreated trees in infested areas of Ontario, Michigan and Ohio suffer high mortality. We demonstrate that the borer has spread in North America through a combination of diffusive range extension, associated with local flights, and by long-distance 'jump' dispersal associated with human movement of infested sapling or contaminated firewood. Probability of infestation was inversely related to distance from borer epicentres but positively related to the size of human population centres. At least 9 of 39 populations that were first reported in Michigan during 2004 cannot be accounted for by local diffusion, raising the possibility that other unidentified mechanisms may be contributing to the dispersal of the beetle. In the absence of quarantine, by 2005 all of Michigan's lower peninsula was contained within the boundaries of potential diffusive range expansion. Infested ash saplings also were introduced from Michigan to Maryland during 2003, and subsequently transplanted to five sites in Maryland and Virginia. Quarantine and eradication measures have had mixed results: in the south-central USA, the species appears on the brink of eradication, whereas its distribution has continued to spread during 2005 in the Great Lakes region despite extensive containment and quarantine measures. Quarantine success in the Great Lakes region is encumbered by multiple dispersal vectors, larger borer population sizes and by the more extensive geographical distribution that was achieved prior to implementation of control measures.					macisaac, hugh/AAE-3742-2020	Muirhead, Jim/0000-0002-0264-3662													1366-9516	1472-4642				JAN	2006	12	1					71	79		10.1111/j.1366-9516.2006.00218.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1366-9516.2006.00218.x													WOS:000234026600008
J	Giesbrecht, GG; Hayward, JS				Giesbrecht, GG; Hayward, JS			Problems and complications with cold-water rescue	WILDERNESS & ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE												A case description is presented of a 9-member rowing team whose scull swamped on a small lake in Victoria, Canada, because of a sudden winter storm, which immersed them in 4 degrees C water for 50 minutes until a small rescue boat found them in darkness. Another 13 minutes of cold exposure in 6.7 degrees C air occurred during boat transport to waiting ambulance paramedics. Two rowers died, one from severe hypothermia and the other from drowning as a consequence of cold incapacitation and hypothermia. The 2 coldest rowers, who were transported 8 kin to a major hospital, arrived with rectal temperatures of 23.4 degrees C and 25 degrees C; the first was asystolic and the second was unconscious and in sinus bradycardia. Analysis of all the circumstances of this incident provided an opportunity to observe a continuum of responses in a heterogeneous group of rowers at risk of severe hypothermia. Several practical lessons concerning cold-water survival, rescue, and treatment can be learned. The effects of low body mass were associated with greater cooling rate. Diminished neuromuscular performance in the periphery appeared to be independent of body mass. Rough handling during moving of patients with marked hypothermia introduces the risk of producing ventricular fibrillation or cardiac arrest. Unconscious, nonshivering hypothermia victims who are rescued and insulated from cold could have a further afterdrop of 3 degrees C to 4 degrees C. During transport to a hospital, the use of heating devices concentrating on core regions may increase the chance of successful treatment in the hospital. Cardiopulmonary bypass may be indicated for severely hypothermic patients in asystole.																			1080-6032					SPR	2006	17	1					26	30		10.1580/PR01-05.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1580/PR01-05.1								16538942					WOS:000236041900005

This short paper presents the results of a survey completed in the northern hemisphere summer of 2022 to determine the perceptions of beach users at Station Beach in Kincardine, Ontario, a popular tourist beach town on Lake Huron. Results suggest that beach safety knowledge and choice of location to occupy along the beach depend on experience with the beach, with frequent visitors tending to select quieter locations located further from a jetty that can result in a structural rip current. Infrequent visitors tended to be closer to the jetty and selected that location based on convenience (e.g., close to parking), suggesting the need for structural changes to guide behaviour towards safer areas of the beach. Results also highlight the challenges of developing an effective warning system to inform beach users of potentially dangerous surf and currents in the absence of an investment in lifeguards or a regional/provincial beach safety strategy.

J	Adhurya, S; Das, S; Ray, S				Adhurya, Sagar; Das, Suvendu; Ray, Santanu			Simulating the effects of aquatic avifauna on the Phosphorus dynamics of aquatic systems	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Many freshwater ecosystems throughout the world support a high number of waterbirds. Nutrient from droppings of these waterbirds may serve as an important source of nutrients to those systems. Previous works suggest that excess nutrients from waterbirds may lead to eutrophication. The excess nutrients also may induce nuisance growth of aquatic weeds in shallow lakes. However, the aquatic weeds serve as an important food for some avian species. The main objective of this work is to study how the waterbirds affect the dynamics of the aquatic ecosystem through a process-based modelling approach. To understand this, a lake with negligible anthropogenic nutrient influx and the high winter-avian congregation is taken as study site. A process-based dynamic ecological model with six state variables has been developed. Phosphorus (P) is taken as model currency since it is the limiting nutrient in most shallow and present in high concentration in the dropping of waterbirds. Before the model calibration, sensitivity analysis is performed with the data collected during the first year of study. Model is validated with the data collected during the second year of study. As per the model, P from the waterbird guano comprises 98.32% of P input to the lake. Parameters affecting the water-sediment exchange of P are most sensitive. P content in zooplankton is the most sensitive state variable. Nutrient budget analysis reveals that internal cycling of the nutrient is the main pathway to sustain productivity in the system. So far, no process-based modelling has been done on the impact of dropping of waterbird on nutrient dynamics of the aquatic system. This kind of model will be helpful to handle problems like eutrophication and macrophyte overgrowth due to eutrophication.					; Adhurya, Sagar/AAH-4406-2021	Das, Suvendu/0000-0002-0691-612X; Adhurya, Sagar/0000-0003-0824-4678													0304-3800	1872-7026				APR 1	2021	445								109495	10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2021.109495	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2021.109495		MAR 2021											WOS:000633031800003

Similar to other African lakes, the water level of Lake Kivu was lower during the dry period before 12,000 years BP. Maximum lake levels due to a more humid climate were recorded between 10,000 and 8,000 years BP. The Lake Kivu basin was probably closed between 8,000 and 6,800 years BP. The sediment record of Lake Kivu revealed dramatic changes around 5,000 years BP. The more recent past sedimentation ( 200 years) is investigated with a short core from the main basin. The sediment core revealed an abrupt change 50 years ago, when carbonates started to precipitate. Since the 1960s, the sedimentation fl uxes of nutrient and soil minerals have increased considerably, while diatom frustules have decreased. These modi fi cations are probably underlain by three non-mutually exclusive processes, namely: (1) the reduced top-down control over phytoplankton following the introduction of the non-native Tanganyika sardine, (2) bottom-up effects due to increased external nutrient inputs caused by the fast-growing population, and/ or (3) increased rainfall leading to higher discharge of the subaquatic springs and thus enhanced upwelling of nutrient-rich deep water. These alterations might have induced a higher productivity in the lake, leading to increased sedimentation and to the onset of carbonate precipitation.

It influences the vertical transport of chemicals and pollutants, due to the significant power generated, overcoming Archimedes forces. The mechanism of Vertical transport of dissolved chemicals through the density shift is connected with the stochastic formation of local turbulent structures - "turbulence flares", which arise because of shifts of current speed in internal waves and eddy-wave formation of the "billows" type. Analyses of data from the Black Sea and Lake Kinneret indicate the universal character for conditions of the dimensionless dependence of logRi = f(Z/Zm) and logRi = f(2logN/Nm), where Ri = the Richardson number, Z = depth, Zm = the depth of the Brunt-Vaisala frequency N(Z) maximum (Nm). A high positive correlation (R = 0.75) between logRi and 2 logN/Nm values allows the use of vertical density profile data (water temperature) for estimating the vertical fluxes of chemical elements and pollutants. The simplicity of measurement and availability of data on density structure of water basins provide means for effective monitoring of vertical transport of chemical elements and pollutants under various conditions.																			0273-1223						2000	42	1-2					341	346		10.2166/wst.2000.0336	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.2000.0336													WOS:000089465000055

Five locations for sediment traps were randomly selected every third day. The traps were moored at the five locations and moved to new locations after 3 days. At every location, a CTD depth profile was obtained and Water samples were collected for plankton, chlorophyll a and nutrient analysis. Meteorological and hydrographic data for the period were obtained from continuous monitoring. Three dinoflagellate species, which have not previously been recorded from the Kattegat or the Skagerrak (Scrippsiella crystallina, Scrippsiella lachrymosa and Scrippsiella trifida), were encountered during the analysis of cysts from. the sediment traps. The abundance of the different species in the motile form encountered in the water column and cyst form encountered in the sediment traps varied greatly. The discrepancy between the number and species encountered in traps and water samples is discussed. No density-dependent relationship between the abundance of planktonic gst-forming dinoflagellates and the number of cysts recovered could be observed. A multiple regression showed that the variation in cyst yield from the traps for the most abundant species was correlated with water sur a,face temperature, ambient light radiation and the depth of the halocline. The nutrient concentrations (NH4+, NO2-, NO3- and PO43-), which are known to play a crucial role in induction of sexuality and cyst formation. under laboratory conditions, correlated poorly with the number of dinoflagellate cysts encountered in the traps.					; Karlson, Bengt/HII-5550-2022	Karlson, Bengt/0000-0002-7524-3504; 													0142-7873					SEP	2001	23	9					923	938		10.1093/plankt/23.9.923	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/23.9.923													WOS:000171286800002

They have been investigated with regard to associated litho-facies and biota, microfabric and stable carbon and oxygen isotopes. The stromatolites of the "Middle Grey Series" are brecciated and reworked by a flooding event of a subsequent lake cycle. They comprise agglutinated stromatolites rich in fish scales as well as skeletal stromatolites composed of a rhythmically grown dendroid micropeloidal framework. The latter are characterized by a shift towards positive delta(13)C values relative to the associated lake carbonates. This points to an effective photosynthesis in biofilm calcification at low concentrations in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in a perennial fresh to brackish water lake. The stromatolites of the "Upper Red Series" occur on top of perennial lake cycles intercalated between playa lake deposits. The fine-grained stromatolites are poor in microfabric characteristics but show a significant covariation of delta(18)O and delta(13C). This points to evaporation/degassing acting as driving mechanism in biofilm calcification. The lack of biotic effects on carbon isotope fractionation may reflect high concentrations in dissolved inorganic carbon. Skeletal oncoids, which occur as allochthonous components within an intraformational lag deposit of the "Upper Red Series", are composed of cyanobacterial tubes and probably represent lowest saline lakes with only poor DIC buffering. Stable isotope signatures in conjunction with stromatolite microfabric analyses may be used as a proxy of DIC concentrations in ancient closed lakes.																			0172-9179					NOV	2005	51	1-4					419	441		10.1007/s10347-005-0063-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10347-005-0063-8													WOS:000235005200031

When exposed to UV-doses and spectral distribution (295-750 nm) closely resembling surface solar radiation during mid summer, Selenastrum showed major losses of cell fluorescence. In the absence of DOC, fluorescence was severely depressed, with successively decreasing effects with increased DOC. Surviving cells also required an extensive recovery period (10-12 d) for regrowth after exposure, while an almost immediate recovery was observed at concentrations above 1 mg DOC l(-1). For Daphnia, survival was reduced to less than 10% after 4 h exposure, and almost zero after 8 h exposure in the absence of humus DOC, while no effects were observed in treatments with 10 and 50 mg C l(-1). Selenastrum and Daphnia that were not directly irradiated, but exposed to UV-irradiated water with the same concentrations of DOC did not reveal negative effects. This indicates negligible indirect effects mediated by long-lived free radicals or other toxic compounds. Irradiation of Daphnia under increased oxygen concentration (200% saturation) did not indicate acute effects, suggesting that effects of ambient radicals and oxidants would be of minor importance relative to intracellular photoproducts.

J	Souch, C; Grimmond, CSB; Wolfe, CP				Souch, C; Grimmond, CSB; Wolfe, CP			Evapotranspiration rates from wetlands with different disturbance histories: Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore	WETLANDS												This study examines the effects of different disturbance histories, specifically patterns of ditching and drainage on wetland evapotranspiration rates for two sites within the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, Indiana, USA. The effect of drainage at the disturbed site is to lower the water table and to reduce the depth and duration of inundation. Evapotranspiration was measured as its energy equivalent, the latent heat flux, within the framework of the surface energy balance using the eddy correlation approach. Results show that when standing water is present at each site, there is very similar flux partitioning; the latent heat flux accounts for approximately 50% of the net radiation (approximately 3.5 mm d(-1)), storage heat Bur 30%, and sensible heat flux 20%. When the disturbed site has no standing water, evapotranspiration rates are maintained at, the same level (3.5-3.75 mm d(-1)), but the storage heat flux drops significantly, and the sensible heat flux is enhanced. Excellent results are obtained with the Penman Monteith evapotranspiration model using a very small surface resistance (5 s m(-1)) when there is no standing water. Although the absolute magnitudes of the results reported are directly relevant only to similar sites in the Midwest USA in summer, the processes and controls described are representative of wetlands located near large water bodies (like Lake Michigan) subjected to diurnal lake (sea) breezes, with vascular vegetation, and a water table at or very close to the surface.					; Grimmond, Sue/A-2179-2009	Grimmond, Sue/0000-0002-3166-9415; 													0277-5212	1943-6246				JUN	1998	18	2					216	229																WOS:000074269500005

On the glaciers of Bylot Island, Nunavut, Arctic Canada	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												The present extent of glacier ice on Bylot Island, Arctic Canada, is mapped using high-resolution Landsat 7 ETM+ satellite imagery. The island is 43% ice covered, with 4783 km(2) of ice. Most ice is centered on the northwest-southeast-tren ding Byam Martin Mountains, flowing outward as radial valley glaciers and piedmont lobes. The largest glacier is 49 km long and 6.5 kin wide. The majority of glaciers terminate on land, but many have margins ending in lakes and two calve into the sea. The late summer snowline, mapped from satellite imagery, is highest along the southern and central parts of the island at about 1050 in, with lower values along the east-northeastern margin of the ice down to about 700 in. These snowline-elevation differences suggest a predominant moisture source from the northeast. Several valley glaciers and piedmont lobes have deformed medial moraines and ice-surface foliation suggesting past surge activity. Ten glaciers are interpreted to be of possible surge-type. The modern extent of glaciers is compared with that of two earlier time intervals. First, we have mapped glacier margins in several areas of Bylot Island from aerial photographs acquired in 1958 and 1961. Secondly, former positions of ice fronts are mapped from moraine systems deposited during the Neoglacial maximum and identified on satellite data. Glaciers have retreated from 0.9 to 1.8 km since the Neoglacial maximum about 120 years ago, with most retreat occurring between 1958/1961 and 2001. Approximately 253 km(2) or 5% of the 1958/1961 ice-covered area has been lost. Overall, marked glacier retreat has occurred, although a few glaciers, possibly of surge-type, show small readvances. This retreat is consistent with observed climate warming in the Canadian Arctic, especially since the 1960s.					; Cawkwell, Fiona/N-2424-2019	Cawkwell, Fiona/0000-0002-7365-8909; Dowdeswell, Julian/0000-0003-1369-9482; 													1523-0430	1938-4246				AUG	2007	39	3					402	411		10.1657/1523-0430(05-123)[DOWDESWELL]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1657/1523-0430(05-123)[DOWDESWELL]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000249936100006
J	Bladin, C; McCrory, P; Pogorzelski, A				Bladin, C; McCrory, P; Pogorzelski, A			Snowboarding injuries - Current trends and future directions	SPORTS MEDICINE												Snowboarding has become one of the premier alpine sports. The past decade has seen the popularity of snowboarding increase dramatically and the recent Winter Olympic Games at Salt Lake City, USA, showcased the strong visual appeal of the sport and the youth-oriented lifestyle and culture that accompanies The injury profile of the sport has also undergone change along with technological advances in boot and binding systems and the changing demographics of the sports participants. Central to the development of injury-prevention strategies is knowledge of the profile of injuries that occur, Understanding those who ate at particular risk and, if possible, the biomechanical factors involved in each injury type. Snowboarding was initially considered a dangerous uncontrolled, alpine sport an opinion based on little or no scientific evidence. That evidence has rapidly grown over the past decade and we now know that snowboard injury rates are no different to those in skiing; however, the injury profile is different. The purpose of this review is to give some perspective to the current snowboard injury literature. It discusses not only the demographic profile of those injured and the type of injuries that occur, but also gives some insight into the progress that has occurred in determining the impact of specific prevention strategies, such as splints to prevent injuries to the wrist/forearm. The next decade will also see a greater understanding of the biomechanical forces involved in snowboard injuries, which may well impact on future technological advances. As the literature indicates, however, some things will not change, e.g. injuries are more likely to occur in beginners and lessons need to be reinforced as a fundamental aspect of any injury-prevention strategy.					bladin, chris/B-9136-2013; McCrory, Paul/Q-8688-2019														0112-1642	1179-2035					2004	34	2					133	138		10.2165/00007256-200434020-00006	http://dx.doi.org/10.2165/00007256-200434020-00006								14965191					WOS:000189272800006
J	Evans, M				Evans, M			Pollen evidence of late Holocene treeline fluctuation from the southern Coast Mountains, British Columbia	GEOGRAPHIE PHYSIQUE ET QUATERNAIRE												Palynological records of Holocene climate change in the southern Coast Mountains identify the Neoglacial period, subsequent to 6600 BP, as cooler and wetter than the preceding Hypsithermal. However, geomorphic evidence of alpine glacier advance suggests that there were three distinct cooler/wetter periods during the Neoglacial. By careful selection of a sensitive alpine site this study has enabled the recognition of two of these stages in a palynological record of Neoglacial climate. Pollen spectra, conifer needle macrofossils, organic matter content, and magnetic susceptibility were assessed for a continuous sequence of sediment from Blowdown Lake, which has a basal date older than 4000 BP. Comparison of the Picea/Pinus pollen ratios from the core with modern surface samples suggests that treeline was at least 100 m above its present elevation until 3400 BP, indicating that summer temperatures were at least 0.7 degrees C above the present. Treeline declined to near present levels by around 2400 BP. Two subsequent periods of lower treeline were identified which appear to correlate approximately with the Tiedemann and Late Neoglacial periods of glacier advance in southwestern British Columbia. Differences between Picea/Pinus and Abies/Pinus ratios from the core are consistent with the autecology of the species. This suggests that the sensitivity of the pollen ratio approach to reconstructing treeline is dependent on the ratios selected.

Impacts of aquatic thrusters on submerged aquatic plants in Kawartha Lakes, Ontario, Canada. Lake Reserv. Manage. XX-XX.Aquatic thrusters are an emerging tool for waterfront landowners to control at a small scale of aquatic plants, algae, and ice cover. Their potential effects to shallow lake aquatic ecosystems remain understudied. During the summer of 2021, 3 aquatic thrusters were installed on docks within the Kawartha Lakes, Ontario, Canada, in a before-after control-impact approach. The aquatic thrusters were operational for 40 d in July to August, 12 h each night, in the shallow nearshore areas, at a fixed horizontal position. Aquatic thrusters significantly reduced plant surface area by 64.9%, floating cover by 70.1%, and plant biomass by 52.0-94.6% in front of the aquatic thrusters, extending approximately 10 m2 into dense aquatic plant beds. Aquatic thrusters caused no significant changes to field water quality, which might have been a result of horizontal positioning of the aquatic thrusters that minimized turbulent water from impacting lake substrates. Further research is required given the potential for aquatic thrusters to affect the biological, physical, and chemical aspects of aquatic ecosystems.																			1040-2381	2151-5530				JAN 2	2025	41	1					34	40		10.1080/10402381.2024.2446911	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10402381.2024.2446911		JAN 2025											WOS:001395863500001
J	Qu, YM				Qu, Yumeng			Mobility and subsistence change as synchronous adaptation during Holocene climate amelioration: Integrated evidence from the early Holocene Xinglong occupation, southeastern Mongolian Plateau (China)	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												In the southeastern Mongolian Plateau, climate records show drastic changes during the early Holocene and ecological environment underwent extensive amelioration. Meanwhile, a marked decline in residential mobility and an increase in occupational intensity suggest that hunter-gatherers in this region underwent important shifts in their subsistence strategies. This paper examines climate variability and environmental changes during the early Holocene (8.7-7.1 cal ka BP) and their impact on subsistence strategies at the Xinglong site by integrating archaeological, paleoenvironmental, macrobotanical, and faunal assemblage data. These chronologies indicate synchronous changes in climate amelioration, reduced mobility, a notable rise in the consumption of large ungulates, and a modest increase in millet cultivation. These multiple lines of evidence indicate that the warmer and wetter climate facilitated widespread forest expansion, leading to the formation of biomass-rich ecotones in the southeastern Mongolian Plateau. The forest-steppe environment enhanced the distribution and abundance of ungulates and caused resource amelioration likely enabled hunter-gatherers to decrease their residential mobility and concentrate on a narrower foraging spectrum. Millet cultivation was developing and was likely the concomitant of more settled lifeways, but millet starch could have been exploited at a very low level and contributed only minimally to the local economy.

J	Darwish, MH; Galal, WF				Darwish, Mahmoud H.; Galal, Wael F.			Spatiotemporal effects of wastewater ponds from a geoenvironmental perspective in the Kharga region, Egypt	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT												One of the major geoenvironmental problems in the Kharga region arises from the haphazard exploitation of groundwater resources and sewage dumping, which have resulted in wastewater accumulation in the form of ponds. The impact of the spatial expansion of wastewater ponds in Kharga and the surrounding area has been so pervasive that ponds have become a source of environmental degradation. These ponds are distributed throughout the area, but the major lakes are located in the eastern and southeastern provinces. The water levels of these ponds are rising at a remarkable rate, especially in the winter, when there is no evaporation and rainfall can lead to overflows that flow towards cities, villages and farmlands. As a result of untreated sewage inflows, all the low surrounding spaces are at high risk of being influenced by these ponds. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the spatiotemporal threats posed by wastewater ponds and develop a conceptual model to estimate the geoenvironmental impacts on the surrounding areas. GIS and remote sensing were used to process all available geological, topographical, hydrogeological, hydrological, land use and environmental data. The pond expansion trend was estimated from Landsat time series from 1984 to 2018, and the results indicated that the wastewater bodies continuously increased and the land cover percentage decreased. The encroachment of wastewater ponds has resulted in extensive land cover disturbances in recent years, and land use change has affected nearly 2.5% of the region. The complexity of the problems associated with wastewater ponds in the Kharga district requires a comprehensive management plan that is effective in not only maintaining the stability of the ponds but also in improving the sociocultural and economic conditions around the ponds. Specifically, the wastewater drainage and accumulation system should be managed according to the surrounding functional context.

J	Rogora, M; Mosello, R; Arisci, S				Rogora, M; Mosello, R; Arisci, S			The effect of climate warming on the hydrochemistry of Alpine Lakes	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												The hydrochemistry of mountain lakes is highly conditioned by the chemical composition of atmospheric deposition and by climate characteristics. Consequently these ecosystems have proved to be sensitive to long-term changes in both factors. Climate warming seems to be particularly pronounced in the Alpine region. A reduction of snow cover in space and time, due to less precipitation and higher temperatures, means a greater exposure of rocks and soils in the watersheds, which enhances weathering processes. In this paper we aim to evaluate the possible effect of these processes on long-term changes in the chemistry of alpine lakes. Recent climate changes affecting the study area were investigated through a data series referring to temperature, precipitation, snow depth and duration at some stations in the Ossola Valley. Chemical data of 35 lakes located in the Ossola and Sesia Valleys (Central Alps) were used. Lakes were sampled both in the late summer of 2000 and 2001 in the framework of two European Projects and the results compared with previous data (1984-1987). Two lakes (Boden Superiore and Inferiore, 2343 and 2334 m a.s.l., respectively), located in the northern part of the study area, have been sampled more or less continuously since the late 70s, enabling us to evaluate the trends of the main chemical variables. For lakes lying in catchments with highly soluble rocks, a comparison between the two data sets shows an increase of solute contents in the last few years. This result could be attributed to increased weathering rates due to climate warming.

J	Bueche, T; Vetter, M				Bueche, Thomas; Vetter, Mark			Simulating water temperatures and stratification of a pre-alpine lake with a hydrodynamic model: calibration and sensitivity analysis of climatic input parameters	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												We report on the calibration of the one-dimensional hydrodynamic lake model Dynamic Reservoir Simulation Model to simulate the water temperature conditions of the pre-alpine Lake Ammersee (southeast Germany) that is a representative of deep and large lakes in this region. Special focus is given to the calibration in order to reproduce the correct thermal distribution and stratification including the time of onset and duration of summer stratification. To ensure the application of the model to investigate the impact of climate change on lakes, an analysis of the model sensitivity under stepwise modification of meteorological input parameters (air temperature, wind speed, precipitation, global radiation, cloud cover, vapour pressure and tributary water temperature) was conducted. The total mean error of the calibration results is -0.23 degrees C, the root mean square error amounts to 1.012 degrees C. All characteristics of the annual stratification cycle were reproduced accurately by the model. Additionally, the simulated deviations for all applied modifications of the input parameters for the sensitivity analysis can be differentiated in the high temporal resolution of monthly values for each specific depth. The smallest applied alteration to each modified input parameter caused a maximum deviation in the simulation results of at least 0.26 degrees C. The most sensitive reactions of the model can be observed through modifications of the input parameters air temperature and wind speed. Hence, the results show that further investigations at Lake Ammersee, such as coupling the hydrodynamic model with chemo-dynamic models to assess the impact of changing climate on biochemical conditions within lakes, can be carried out using Dynamic Reservoir Simulation Model.

Late Holocene coastal development along the southern shore of Lake Michigan determined by strategic dating of stabilized parabolic dunes and wetlands of the Tolleston Beach	COASTLINE AND DUNE EVOLUTION ALONG THE GREAT LAKES	Geological Society of America Special Papers											Well-developed simple, stabilized parabolic dunes that are oriented to the east and southeast form the inland portion of a dune complex that extends similar to 32 km east-west across the southern shoreline of Lake Michigan in northwest Indiana. To better understand shoreline evolution during the Nipissing and post-Nipissing phases of Lake Michigan, subsurface sedimentology and radiocarbon ages from interdunal wetlands are considered with optical ages from nearby dunes within the landward portion of this area known as the Tolleston Beach. In the east, the once expansive Great Marsh had developed during the lake-level fall from the Nipissing peak (similar to 4500 years ago). Units of eolian sand found within vibracores from the Great Marsh indicate that dunes formed and began migrating into the wetlands 4200-4400 years ago. In the west, newly formed dunes migrated along the shoreline while small interdunal wetlands formed shortly thereafter. Optical ages from two individual dunes indicate that this relict dune system stabilized by similar to 3500 years ago. Six samples collected from each of the two dunes yield optical ages that overlap at two standard errors. However, variations in individual ages detect episodic processes of sand movement that distinguish between the timing of landform migration and stabilization. Optical ages collected at the base of the slipface are interpreted as the age of landform stabilization. This study indicates that, with focused field-to-lab strategies, optical dating can provide a more robust chronology of shoreline development than previously considered; correlating eolian activity to wetland development and lake-level change in the Great Lakes.

Thermal selection and delayed migration by adult sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) following escape from simulated in-river fisheries capture	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Two hypotheses were tested concerning the consequences to adult sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) of escape from commonly used fishing gear (gillnet, seine net and tangle net). First, by experimentally exposing 214 fish to three commonly used fishing gear types (gillnets, tangle nets, or seine nets) and releasing to complete migration after PIT-tagging, we tested the hypothesis that migration success and behaviour are differentially impacted according to the type of fishing gear interaction and escape. Also, by fitting salmon with thermal loggers, we tested whether salmon behaviourally selected cooler lake water following an escape encounter. Migration success was unaffected after escape from the simulated gear types compared to control fish. Surviving sockeye salmon that had gillnet or seine net encounter, but not a tangle net encounter, on average took approximately 2 days longer to migrate to the spawning area (averaging 14.7 days and 14.9 days, respectively) compared to control fish (12.6 days). Furthermore, escaped fish migrated at cooler temperatures through a lake system (average of 14.0 degrees C) compared to control fish (15.3 degrees C), which would reduce their absolute cost of transport during this migration by reducing the standard metabolic rate by about 10%. Consequently, in addition to demonstrating that fish escapement from a fishing gear will alter their subsequent migration behaviour, we introduce the possibility that the associated increase in energy expenditure and migration delay can be partially compensated for by behavioural selection of cooler water, if it is available, to lower basic energy turnover in a fish that is entirely reliant on energy stores to fuel its spawning migration.

Revisiting Camu-camu (Myrciaria dubia): Twenty-seven Years of Fruit Collection and Flooding at an Oxbow Lake in Peruvian Amazonia	ECONOMIC BOTANY												Revisiting Camu-camu ( Myrciaria dubia ): Twenty-seven Years of Fruit Collection and Flooding at an Oxbow Lake in Peruvian Amazonia Camu-camu (Myrciaria dubia HBK McVaugh; Myrtaceae) is an important riparian species in the floodplain forests of Peruvian Amazonia, and its fruits have been harvested commercially for over 30 years. We examined the population impacts of intensive fruit collection on this species by remeasuring a 1,000 m(2) inventory transect that was established in 1984 in a dense stand of M. dubia along an oxbow lake. We found that regeneration rates had declined notably since the original survey, and that the number of M. dubia individuals had dropped from 693 to 161 genets. While this dramatic shift in population structure would appear to be caused by excessive fruit collection, the same decline in regeneration was noted for Eugenia inundata DC, an associated species of similar growth form and phenology that is not harvested. The life cycles of both species are closely tied to the rise and fall of the river. In addition to annual fruit collection, we suggest that the extreme hydrological events that have occurred in the Amazon Basin over the last few decades, as well as the successional development of the ox-box lake study site that has been slowly filling up with sediment, also play a role in the observed reduction in M. dubia numbers.

J	Lawson, NM; Mason, RP				Lawson, NM; Mason, RP			Concentration of mercury, methylmercury, cadmium, lead, arsenic,and selenium in the rain and stream water of two contrasting watersheds in Western Maryland	WATER RESEARCH												Weekly wet deposition and throughfall rain samples were collected in. the Blacklick Run (BLK) and Herrington Creek Tributary (HCRT), two streams in western Maryland (MD). Samples were analyzed for total mercury (Hg), methylmercury (MMHg), arsenic (As), selenium (Se), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb). Hg concentrations generally fell between 50 and 100pM. comparable to concentrations in wet deposition measured at other MID sites. While Hg concentrations decreased with rainfall amount, a similar washout trend was not seen for MMHg. Cd, Pb, As. and Se concentrations were comparable overall to those measured in the region. Concentrations of Hg, Cd, and Pb in throughfall were similar between sites and equivalent or higher than wet deposition concentrations. As and Se concentrations were similar in throughfall at the two sites, though throughfall at BLK seemed to be punctuated with slightly higher concentrations of these two metals. Concentrations of Hg, MMHg, Cd, Pb, As, Se, and SPM were measured in monthly stream collections and compared with concentrations found in other MD rivers. In addition to the monthly collections, four storm events were sampled. These measurements demonstrate the importance of storm events in trace metal transport. especially for Hg. Pb and MMHg. For these metals, a strong correlation between metal and suspended particulate concentration was evident. Retention efficiencies of the watersheds for the metals were calculated for each watershed. Of all the metals, Hg is the most and As is the least strongly retained in the watershed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The bonebed occurs on a single bedding plane within a thin sandstone layer. This unit is part of a nearshore facies of a calcium carbonate-rich lake in which the water was warm, shallow, and quiet at the site of the mortality layer. A representative area of this bonebed, approximately 450 square centimeters in size, provides the basis for this taphonomic and paleoecologic study. This area contains approximately 600 bones and at least 19 individuals are represented. Skeletons are nearly completely disarticulated but somewhat associated, bone modification features are absent, a slight preferred orientation of the linear bones is present, and many of the lighter, less dense skeletal elements are underrepresented. Scavengers probably contributed to disarticulation of the skeletons. Bone depletion occurred by a combination of the action of scavengers, weak currents, and the sloughing off of body parts as the carcasses floated. The assemblage was not subjected to extensive winnowing by currents. All of the specimens within this assemblage represent young adults. Because the frogs are all of the same ontogenetic age and the deposit shows no signs of time averaging, the assemblage is interpreted as the result of catastrophic death, possibly by disease, of one age class. Either a population of frogs inhabited the site where the mortality layer formed or the carcasses floated into it.

J	Giovannini, L; Zardi, D; De Franceschia, M; Chen, F				Giovannini, Lorenzo; Zardi, Dino; De Franceschia, Massimiliano; Chen, Fei			Numerical simulations of boundary- layer processes and urban- induced alterations in an Alpine valley	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												High-resolution simulations are performed with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, coupled with an advanced urban parameterization scheme, to evaluate the modifications induced by the urban area of Trento on boundary-layer processes in the Alpine Adige Valley in a typical summer sunny day. Specific gridded datasets of urban morphology parameters and anthropogenic heat releases were created to provide high-resolution input information for the urban scheme. Comparison of model results against measurements from surface weather stations shows that the model simulates reasonably well the development of valley winds, as well as the complex interaction occurring north of Trento between the up-valley wind of the Adige Valley and a lake breeze flowing from a tributary valley. The urban heat island of the city is also well captured by the model, with stronger intensities at night and lower values during daytime. Comparisons with an idealized simulation, where all the urban land use grid points are replaced by cropland, suggest that the city inhibits the development of the ground-based thermal inversion at night and also affects valley winds, modifying both the typical down-valley wind, and the interaction between the up-valley wind of the Adige Valley and the lake breeze. Further sensitivity tests are performed to evaluate the impacts of the gridded datasets of urban morphology and anthropogenic heat releases, and to assess what are the benefits of using the advanced urban scheme against a simple bulk parameterization. Results highlight that even the moderate anthropogenic heat releases present in Trento appreciably affect nocturnal temperatures in the city, while gridded information on urban parameters is not essential in the present case, because urban morphology does not display a high spatial variability. However, it is shown that the choice of the urban scheme may have significant impacts on both temperature and wind fields.					; Zardi, Dino/J-3237-2012; Giovannini, Lorenzo/A-5468-2015; Chen, Fei/JZC-6314-2024	de Franceschi, Massimiliano/0000-0002-3424-3292; Zardi, Dino/0000-0002-3573-3920; Giovannini, Lorenzo/0000-0003-1650-0344; Chen, Fei/0000-0003-2573-3828													0899-8418	1097-0088				MAR	2014	34	4					1111	1131		10.1002/joc.3750	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/joc.3750													WOS:000332833900013

Significant reductions in total and soluble reactive P concentrations occurred in the lake since that time. By 1976 the average (volume weighed over the entire lake) total and soluble reactive P concentrations declined from about 51 and 21 .mu.g l-1 to about 30 and 4.5 .mu.g l-1, respectively, corresponding to 40 and 80% reductions. During 1975 and 1976, chlorophyll a (averaged over the top 5 m) decreased to less than 50% of the pretreatment level during May-June, but during July-Aug. little change occurred. A P residence time model projected equilibrium total P concentrations of about 12 .mu.g l-1 within 1.5 yr. The fact that this level was not reached was attributed to a feedback of P from the sediments, primarily during summer. This phenomenon was incorporated into a modified total P mass balance model which projected the P pattern through 1976 quite accurately. The close fit of the modified mass balance model implied that the P supply from the sediments had not diminished since treatment began, and that further recovery of the lake will depend upon how long this feedback of P from the sediments continues.																			0043-1354	1879-2448					1979	13	12					1259	1272		10.1016/0043-1354(79)90170-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(79)90170-2													WOS:A1979HY52500017

Challenges to deep-water reproduction by lake trout: Pertinence to restoration in Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Restoration efforts for lake trout Salvelinus namaycush in Lake Michigan are increasingly being focused on re-establishment of the species in deep water. This focus is based in part on examination of historical records of indigenous lake trout, which suggest that oft hore reefs, especially deep reefs, sustained the greatest numbers of lake trout. This focus is also based on the increasing impact of non-indigenous species, such as alewife and round goby, on lake trout survival on shallow reefs. Development of a successful strategy,for re-establishing deep-water lake trout in Luke Michigan will require a better understanding of the challenges to a species that evolved in shallow water and whose nearest relatives are shallow-water fishes. The challenges include an annual temperature cycle with fall warming rather than cooling, which may impact reproductive timing and embryo incubation. Deep water presents challenges to fry in that there is no apparent physiological mechanism for producing swim bladder gas and initial filling of the swim bladder at the surface has little impact on buoyancy once a fry returns to depth and the swim bladder is compressed. First feeding is a challenge because there is no local primary production to support a rich prey supply and the phenology of zooplankton prey abundance differs from that in small lakes. We propose that plans for restoration of lake trout into deepwater habitats in Lake Michigan must proceed in concert with research leading to a better understanding of extant deepwater strains in Lake Superior.

Low-resolution Australasian palaeoclimate records of the last 2000 years	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												Non-annually resolved palaeoclimate records in the Australasian region were compiled to facilitate investigations of decadal to centennial climate variability over the past 2000 years. A total of 675 lake and wetland, geomorphic, marine, and speleothem records were identified. The majority of records are located near population centres in southeast Australia, in New Zealand, and across the maritime continent, and there are few records from the arid regions of central and western Australia. Each record was assessed against a set of a priori criteria based on temporal resolution, record length, dating methods, and confidence in the proxy-climate relationship over the Common Era. A subset of 22 records met the criteria and were endorsed for subsequent analyses. Chronological uncertainty was the primary reason why records did not meet the selection criteria. New chronologies based on Bayesian techniques were constructed for the high-quality subset to ensure a consistent approach to age modelling and quantification of age uncertainties. The primary reasons for differences between published and reconstructed age-depth models were the consideration of the non-singular distribution of ages in calibrated C-14 dates and the use of estimated autocorrelation between sampled depths as a constraint for changes in accumulation rate. Existing proxies and reconstruction techniques that successfully capture climate variability in the region show potential to address spatial gaps and expand the range of climate variables covering the last 2000 years in the Australasian region. Future palaeoclimate research and records in Australasia could be greatly improved through three main actions: (i) greater data availability through the public archiving of published records; (ii) thorough characterisation of proxy-climate relationships through site monitoring and climate sensitivity tests; and (iii) improvement of chronologies through core-top dating, inclusion of tephra layers where possible, and increased date density during the Common Era.					; Drysdale, Russell/AAH-9376-2019	Dixon, Bronwyn/0000-0002-6395-4966; GERGIS, JOELLE/0000-0002-4168-7924; Tyler, Jonathan/0000-0001-8046-0215; Drysdale, Russell/0000-0001-7867-031X; Goodwin, Ian/0000-0001-8682-6409													1814-9324	1814-9332				OCT 26	2017	13	10					1403	1433		10.5194/cp-13-1403-2017	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-13-1403-2017													WOS:000413733000002

To assess physiological and growth reactions of Douglas-fir provenances towards climate- and weather-related environmental conditions we took advantage of a provenance trial with three sites in south-western Germany located along an elevation gradient. We examined six different provenances of Douglas-fir from North America for oxygen (delta O-18) and carbon (delta C-13) stable isotope composition in tree rings as well as for radial increment for a 7 year period and long-term height growth. Our results show that different Douglas-fir provenances clearly vary in their drought sensitivity at the driest and warmest site in the valley as shown by the radial growth decline in the extreme dry and hot year 2003. The growth decline in the provenances Pamelia Creek, Cameron Lake, Duncan Paldi and Conrad Creek could be clearly attributed to a reduction in stomatal conductance as assessed by the relations between delta O-18 and delta C-13 in the tree rings. These responses were not related to the long-term average climate at the places of origin of the provenances and the provenances with the lowest long-term (height) growth potential were the ones least affected in radial increment by the extreme drought of 2003. When selecting suitable Douglas-fir provenances, which are adapted to the climatic conditions projected for the future we thus might need to take into account the trade-off between the adaptation to extreme drought periods and the long-term growth performance. Site-specific evaluations of the probability of extreme drought events are thus needed to select the appropriate provenances.

The risk of nitrogen leaching and groundwater pollution may be minimised by organic farming, which has expanded in Germany during recent years. The study was conducted on an organically. farmed rye field next to a lake in the state of Brandenburg between 2002 and 2004. In order to show how far organic farming may affect lake water quality, soil inorganic nitrogen (CaCl2 extraction) and denitrification (acetylene inhibition method) were studied along an aquatic terrestrial transition zone (A field site: 5 in above water level, B = field site: 1 in above water level, C riparian zone with macrophytes: 0.5 in above water level). Although the field did not receive any organic and mineral fertiliser there was a nitrogen leaching from the field to the groundwater caused by the weather. Nitrogen loss during the winter was 29 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) and 12 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) in 2002/03 and 2003/04, respectively. Deviation between the two years seemed to be caused by great differences in precipitation. No nitrogen loss was observed from a control site. High denitrification was measured at sites B and C indicating an efficient nitrogen removal capacity within the riparian buffer zone.

The effects of time and station were assessed to serve as the basis of further studies that would identify plant sources for consumers and describe the food web of this turbid lake. Samples of water and plankton were taken at four stations along an east to west thalweg; sediments were obtained at four additional stations in coves off the main lake channel. Isotope ratios were obtained for dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), particulate organic matter (POM), zooplankton, and sediments as well as content of C and N. Time effects were significant in June and July for delta C-13 (DIC), delta C-13 (POM), C:N (POM) and delta N-15 (ZOOPLANKTON), but not for sediments. Station effects were small except for lower %C and %N of sediments in two stations in the lake coves. We conclude that sampling in the summer at the downstream station would be sufficient for an isotope study of the lake. But, it will be necessary to separate algae from detritus and zooplankton, and separate zooplankton and algae taxa to obtain more precise information on plant source and food web transfers in this lake.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				SEP	2009	24	3					461	467		10.1080/02705060.2009.9664319	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2009.9664319													WOS:000269773700014
J	Storen, EN; Dahl, SO; Lie, O				Storen, Eivind Nagel; Dahl, Svein Olaf; Lie, Oyvind			Separation of late-Holocene episodic paraglacial events and glacier fluctuations in eastern Jotunheimen, central southern Norway	HOLOCENE												The lacustrine sediments of proglacial lake Russvatnet in eastern Jotunheimen, central southern Norway, comprise a combination of glacier-derived material from the glacier Blackwellbreen and several episodic paraglacial processes in the catchment. This study focuses on the characteristics of lake sediments, and the decomposition of a 4000-yr complex multiprocess record from Russvatnet, in order to separate late-Holocene river floods, mass movements and glacier fluctuations. Facies models based on grain-size distribution, minerogenic content and amount of terrestrial macrofossils are used to recognize discrete mass movement and river flood deposits. Twenty-two episodic events are identified during the late Holocene, classified as 11 mass movement events (debris flows, high density turbidity currents and low density turbidity currents) and 11 river flood events. Enhanced river flood and colluvial activity is inferred at 4000-3400, 2900-2500, 2000-1400 and 1000-500 cal. yr BP. Glaciolacustrine core segments were analysed based on magnetic susceptibility, bulk density and loss-on-ignition to reconstruct variations in late-Holocene glacier magnitude. At c. 2300 cal. yr BP a shift in sedimentation regime from a paraglacial to a glacially dominated regime is recorded, and a Neoglacial expansion period after 2300 cal. yr BP is suggested. A contrasting pattern of climate deterioration and rapid episodic events are recorded in lake Russvatnet. Large regional variations in the timing of episodic events emphasize the importance of local triggering factors compared with more large-scale effects of climate change.																			0959-6836	1477-0911				DEC	2008	18	8					1179	1191		10.1177/0959683608096593	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683608096593													WOS:000261243200003

Barry			Fish and land use influence Gammarus lacustris and Hyalella azteca (Amphipoda) densities in large wetlands across the upper Midwest	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Gammarus lacustris and Hyalella azteca (hereafter G. lacustris and H. azteca, respectively) are important components of secondary production in wetlands and shallow lakes of the upper Midwest, USA. Within the past 50 years, amphipod densities have decreased while occurrences of fish and intensity of agricultural land use have increased markedly across this landscape. We investigated influences of fish, sedimentation, and submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) on densities of G. lacustris and H. azteca in semipermanent and permanent wetlands and shallow lakes (n = 283) throughout seven eco-physiographic regions of Iowa, Minnesota, and North Dakota during 2004-2005. G. lacustris and H. azteca densities were positively correlated with densities of SAV (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). Both species were negatively correlated with densities of large fish (non-Cyprinidae; P = 0.01 and P = 0.013, respectively) and with high densities of fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas; P < 0.001 and P = 0.033, respectively). H. azteca densities also were negatively correlated with densities of small fish (e. g., other minnows [Cyprinidae] and sticklebacks [Gasterosteidae]; P = 0.048) and common carp (Cyprinus spp.; P = 0.022). G. lacustris densities were negatively correlated with high levels of suspended solids (an index for sedimentation; P < 0.001). H. azteca densities were positively correlated with the width of upland-vegetation buffers ( P = 0.004). Our results indicate that sedimentation and fish reduce amphipod densities and may contribute to the current low densities of amphipods in the upper Midwest. Thus, removing/excluding fish, and providing a thick buffer of upland vegetation around wetlands may help restore amphipod densities and wetland and water quality within this landscape.

Two images, with a spatial resolution of 5 m were acquired by the Multispectral Infrared and Visible Imaging Spectrometer (MIVIS) in the summers of 1997 and 2005. Image data were first geocoded and then corrected for both atmospheric and skylight reflection effects at the water surface using the 6S radiative transfer code. The two images were inverted using a bio-optical model, which was parameterised with the inherent optical properties of the lake. The inversion utilized the spectral range from 0.48-0.60 mu m because it simultaneously provided the lowest environmental noise and the best atmospheric correction performances for the two scenes and produced images of bottom depth and of two substrate classes: bare sand and submerged vegetation, representing a mixture of valuable freshwater species. The MIVIS-derived bottom depth ranges and patterns were comparable to a bathymetry chart with a deviation less than 5%. In 2005, the image was consistent with contemporaneous in-situ derived knowledge on macrophyte distribution. In 1997, the substrate image map was deemed reasonable with respect to the macrophyte distribution documented in 2000. The comparison of the substrate products for the two dates showed a marked decrease in macrophyte beds, with a concomitant increase in sandy substrates. In the 8-year interval the extent of submerged macrophyte decreased from 72% to 52%. We expect that this study will contribute to increased knowledge of macrophyte colonisation patterns of the Sirmione Peninsula, where, despite their ecological significance, changes have been poorly documented.					; Bresciani, Mariano/H-7501-2013; Candiani, Gabriele/F-1443-2010; bartoli, marco/E-5321-2017; Giardino, Claudia/O-9923-2015; Bartoli, Marco/E-5321-2017	Bresciani, Mariano/0000-0002-7185-8464; Candiani, Gabriele/0000-0001-5270-071X; bartoli, marco/0000-0002-5022-6206; Giardino, Claudia/0000-0002-3937-4988; 													1931-3195						2007	1								011509	10.1117/1.2834807	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/1.2834807													WOS:000260914300055

InSAR can indirectly reflect the degradation of permafrost by monitoring its deformation. This study selected three typical permafrost regions in North America: Alaskan North Slope, Northern Great Bear Lake, and Southern Angikuni Lake. These regions encompass a range of permafrost landscapes, from tundra to needleleaf forests and lichen-moss, and we used Sentinel-1 SAR data from 2018 to 2021 to determine their deformation. In the InSAR process, due to the prolonged snow cover in the circum-Arctic permafrost, we used only SAR data collected during the summer and applied a two-stage interferogram selection strategy to mitigate the resulting temporal decorrelation. The Alaskan North Slope showed pronounced subsidence along the coastal alluvial plains and uplift in areas with drained thermokarst lake basins. Northern Great Bear Lake, which was impacted by wildfires, exhibited accelerated subsidence rates, revealing the profound and lasting impact of wildfires on permafrost degradation. Southern Angikuni Lake's lichen and moss terrains displayed mild subsidence. Our InSAR results indicate that more than one-third of the permafrost in the North American study area is degrading and that permafrost in diverse landscapes has different deformation patterns. When monitoring the degradation of large-scale permafrost, it is crucial to consider the unique characteristics of each landscape.					; Tang, Yx/HMV-9782-2023; Wang, Chao/GSN-3524-2022; LI, Tianyang/JWA-4271-2024; guan, shaoyang/NVM-0392-2025	Wang, Chao/0000-0003-4887-923X; Li, Tianyang/0000-0002-0242-3870; guan, shaoyang/0009-0004-7567-7945; zhang, hong/0000-0002-0088-8148; 														2072-4292				AUG	2024	16	15							2809	10.3390/rs16152809	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs16152809													WOS:001287117300001

Keith, DA		Wetland Vegetation of Inland Australia	AUSTRALIAN VEGETATION, 3RD EDITION												Wetlands fed by rainwater, surface flows and groundwater occur throughout Australia, even in arid areas. This chapter focuses on temporary wetlands and permanently wet systems that are dominated by - non-woody macrophytes. We use nine case studies that span Australia to illustrate their biogeography, dynamics and key threats of Australian Wetlands. The type and distribution of wetland vegetation, from the annually flooded wetlands of northern Australia, to saline lakes of arid and semi-arid Australia, to groundwater- dependent systems of the southwest, to bogs and fens of the Alps and Tasmania, reflects hydrology, climate and geomorphology. Wetland plants have developed a range of adaptations and life histories to tolerate the dynamic water regimes characteristic of Australian wetlands, and can be grouped into seven categories that reflect these adaptations. Waterbirds and water can connect spatially isolated systems, and seedbanks that last for decades allow species to disperse through time. The water regime is a strong driver of species composition and abundance, thus hydrological modification through water extraction, flow regulation or reductions in rainfall is a significant threat to wetland flora, and arguably the principal threat for Australian wetland vegetation. The displacement of native macrophytes by exotic and terrestrial species is both a symptom and cause of ecological change, with exotic plants often being better adapted to modified flooding and fire regimes, livestock grazing and eutrophication than natives. Introduced livestock and feral fauna eat, trample and uproot native plants, and degrade their habitat. These types of threats are expected to intensify, increasing the challenge for wetland management and policy.

J	Stea, RR; Mott, RJ				Stea, RR; Mott, RJ			Younger Dryas glacial advance in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, Canada: analogue for ice inception?	BOREAS												In the summer of 1999, the Maritimes and Northeast Pipeline Company excavated a 3-m-deep trench across northern Nova Scotia exposing a continuous transect of surficial deposits along a 237-km corridor. A Lateglacial palaeosol with preserved A horizon (peat and wood) buried under 2-10 m of surface till consisted mainly of herbaceous plant material with few large wood fragments. Large pieces of wood from two sites yielded conventional radiocarbon ages of 10.9 C-14 kyr BP (GSC-6435) and 10.8 C-14 kyr BP (GSC-6419). Previous to these finds, only a few localities were known to reveal till overlying peat, so the extent of Younger Dryas (YD) glaciers could not be clearly established. Glacial flow lines indicated by fabric and fluting of the YD surface till sheet in northern Nova Scotia and ice-marginal deposits imply an ice cap centred over eastern P. E. I. and the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence. This glacier also dammed a series of glacial lakes against the highland-rimmed west coast of Cape Breton Island. Glaciers developed and advanced during the YD in the uplands and offshore shelf areas from small remnants of Late Wisconsinan ice. Renewed ice growth was enabled by increased precipitation and local cooling in the Gulf of St. Lawrence due to deflection of the jet stream and expanded sea-ice cover in the North Atlantic. The YD may provide an analogy to glacier development in Maritime Canada during the interglacial/glacial transition.																			0300-9483	1502-3885				AUG	2005	34	3					345	362		10.1080/03009480510012980	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03009480510012980													WOS:000230505400009

LocationTree line ecotone from north boreal forest to subarctic tundra in northeastern Finnish Lapland. TaxonCladocera (Crustacea: Branchiopoda). MethodsThirty-one small and shallow lakes were examined for summer epilimnetic communities (SEC) and surface sediment fossil integrative communities (FIC) of Cladocera for species distribution and their environmental correlations. A 700-year down-core sediment sequence from a tree line lake (Nammajavri) was analysed for FICs and cladoceran-inferred UV absorbance (ABS(UV), indicative of melanin pigmentation) for evidence of long-term community and photoprotective responses and compared with records of palaeotemperature, solar intensity, and composite sediment biogeochemistry by variance partitioning analysis. ResultsThe SECs were primarily correlated with specific UV absorbance (indicative of UV exposure) and total phosphorus and FICs by mean July air temperature and total nitrogen. The Nammajavri FICs showed subtle changes with a directional shift between the 19th and 21st centuries and were mostly explained by solar intensity. ABS(UV) exhibited increases during the 18th and 20th centuries, being related to variation in sediment biogeochemistry, which was indicative of changes in auto- versus allochthonous production. Main conclusionsThe ecotonal distribution of cladocerans is sensitive to temperature, nutrients, and allochthonous carbon, which is closely linked with UV exposure. The long-term community shifts and photoprotection have been governed by solar intensity and biogeochemical shifts through lake water optics, attributable to direct UV impact or climate-mediated intensification in photodegradation of allochthonous carbon. Estimations of the dual effects and mechanisms of increasing temperatures and UV on subarctic lakes and their biota remain challenging as their individual impacts on key species were partly contradictory.					; Rantala, Marttiina/GWV-8049-2022	Rantala, Marttiina/0000-0002-3231-5926; Nevalainen, Liisa/0000-0001-6837-8753; Luoto, Tomi/0000-0001-6925-3688													0305-0270	1365-2699				AUG	2018	45	8					1954	1965		10.1111/jbi.13371	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbi.13371													WOS:000440297300021

Nitrogen dynamics in Lake Okeechobee: forms, functions, and changes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Total nitrogen (TN) in Lake Okeechobee, a large, shallow, turbid lake in south Florida, has averaged between 90 and 150 mu M on an annual basis since 1983. No TN trends are evident, despite major storm events, droughts, and nutrient management changes in the watershed. To understand the relative stability of TN, this study evaluates nitrogen (N) dynamics at three temporal/spatial levels: (1) annual whole lake N budgets, (2) monthly in-lake water quality measurements in offshore and nearshore areas, and (3) isotope addition experiments lasting 3 days and using N-15-ammonium ((NH4)-N-15 (+)) and N-15-nitrate ((NO3)-N-15 (-)) at two offshore locations. Budgets indicate that the lake is a net sink for N. TN concentrations were less variable than net N loads, suggesting that in-lake processes moderate these net loads. Monthly NO3 (-) concentrations were higher in the offshore area and higher in winter for both offshore and nearshore areas. Negative relationships between the percentage of samples classified as algal blooms (defined as chlorophyll a > 40 mu g l(-1)) and inorganic N concentrations suggest N-limitation. Continuous-flow experiments over intact sediment cores measured net fluxes (mu mol N m(-2) h(-1)) between 0 and 25 released from sediments for NH4 (+), 0-60 removed by sediments for NO3 (-), and 63-68 transformed by denitrification. Uptake rates in the water column (mu mol N m(-2) h(-1)) determined by isotope dilution experiments and normalized for water depth were 1,090-1,970 for NH4 (+) and 59-119 for NO3 (-). These fluxes are similar to previously reported results. Our work suggests that external N inputs are balanced in Lake Okeechobee by denitrification.

The maximum temperature and pressure in the capsules reached 545 K and 12.5 GPa respectively. Using the LC-MS-MS analysis, the 21 synthesis products have been identified, including amines and polyamines, carboxamide, acetamide and urea derivatives, compounds containing aniline, pyrrolidine, pyrrole, imidazole, as well as alcohol groups. It was found that the Fischer-Tropsch-type syntheses with catalysis on the surface of the stainless steel of the conservation capsule associated with the adsorbed hydrogen cyanide reactions and transamidation processes play the main role in the shock syntheses. Formation reactions of all the above-mentioned compounds have been suggested. It was proposed that hydrogen cyanide, ammonia, isocyanic acid, aminonitrile, aminoacetonitrile, as well as adsorbed species H-(a), CH(a), CH2(a), CHOH(a), NH2(a) and H2CNH(a) are especially important for the formation of the products. A reduction reaction of adsorbed bicarbonate with hydrogen to formaldehyde has been first postulated. In the studied system also classical reactions take place - Wohler's synthesis of urea and Butlerov's synthesis of methenamine. It was suggest that material of meteorites may be an effective catalyst in the Fischer-Tropsch-type syntheses at falling of the iron-nickel meteorites in the water - formamide regions on the early Earth. It was concluded that life could have originated due to the impact of meteorites on alkaline water-formamide lakes located near volcanoes on the early Earth.

J	Binks, JA; Arnott, SE; Sprules, WG				Binks, JA; Arnott, SE; Sprules, WG			Local factors and colonist dispersal influence crustacean zooplankton recovery from cultural acidification	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												We investigated the roles of local environmental conditions and dispersal limitation in zooplankton recovery from acidification in Swan Lake, Ontario, a historically acidified, metal-contaminated lake. We hypothesized that local environmental conditions (pH and the presence of resident, acid-tolerant zooplankton) would limit the establishment of several zooplankton colonist species. We tested this in a factorial mesocosm experiment that ran for 32 days during the mid summer. Ambient pH (5.6) reduced the abundance of two acid-sensitive cladoceran taxa, Daphnia spp. and Ceriodaphnia lacustris compared to elevated pH (6.5) but increased the abundance of cyclopoid copepod juveniles. The reside-it community suppressed Skistodiaptomus oregonensis and Diacyclops bicuspidatus thomasi, and to a lesser extent Mesocyclops edax, but slightly enhanced Daphnia spp. We also hypothesized that conditions in the sediments of acidified Swan Lake would limit zooplankton recruitment from diapausing eggs. We tested this by reciprocally transferring sediments containing eggs between Swan Lake and a nearby recovered lake, and incubating them for 15 weeks in 20-L emergence traps.,Most zooplankton emerged from diapause in both lakes indicating that this mechanism contributes to the recolonization of acidified lakes once pH returns to normal. Some species, however, emerged in only one lake or the other, indicating that hatching cues such as light, temperature, oxygen, or appropriate pH may have been missing. Our experiments demonstrate that both local lake conditions and diapausing eggs can influence zooplankton recovery. Continued recovery may require additional management efforts to reduce and control regional acid emissions and active intervention in the form of food web manipulations.

In this study, a geochemical analysis of stable carbon and hydrogen isotopes and an interpretation of individual gas molecular composition were done in order to determine the origin and composition of the naturally occurring hydrocarbon gases in Tanganyika Basin. Nitrogen, a non-hydrocarbon gas is a major component (76.69%-78.31%) by volume percentage followed by methane (11.68%-12.94%) and other higher hydrocarbons (0.16%-1.63%). The isotopic composition of carbon delta C-13(1) and hydrogen delta DC1 ranges from - 65.32 parts per thousand to -65.81 parts per thousand and -272.5 parts per thousand to -275.9 parts per thousand respectively. The isotopic compositions of ethane (delta DC2 = - 36.7 parts per thousand to -35.2 parts per thousand) and propane (delta DC3 = -31.3 parts per thousand to - 27.5 parts per thousand) reflect the thermogenic origin of these higher hydrocarbons. According to molecular characterization of carbon and hydrogen isotope ratios and delta D-values, methane gas falls in the biogenic origin category and is formed by carbon dioxide reduction. The isotopic composition of CO2 varies between -8.6 parts per thousand and -3.4 parts per thousand. CO2 reduction is also regarded as a mechanism of biogenic methane formation based on carbon isotope fractionation factors (greater than 0.16).					; Bishanga, Januarius/HNS-0952-2023	MATATA BISHANGA, JANUARIUS/0000-0003-2734-2564; 													0011-3891					MAR 25	2021	120	6					1066	1073		10.18520/cs/v120/i6/1066-1073	http://dx.doi.org/10.18520/cs/v120/i6/1066-1073													WOS:000634462300032

Data from three different surveys were employed, i.e. topographical (dating back to 1977, before the onset of flooding) and bathymetrical (1986 and 2000) surveys. The drainage basin of this reservoir extends across three countries, Romania, Ukraine and Republic of Moldova, and whereas the mountain sector of the basin is mostly covered by forest, the lowland (the Moldavian Plateau) is used for agriculture, i.e., cereal crops. Thus, deforestation and inappropriate tillage techniques employed within this basin result in increased soil erosion. Most of the sediment load is carried during flood events, which have grown increasingly common, particularly in summer. The terraces formed along the downstream sector of the reservoir are not covered by alluvium, whereas the corresponding terraces from its upper sector have been covered by submerged glacises. Moreover, in the area of Ciugur river mouth we observed a submerged valley, as well as several submerged natural levees. The deepest area of the reservoir (29.2 m) is located adjacent to the dam and is thought to be the outcome of a circular current generated by the lake bottom morphology. The silting degree is rather high, ranging up to an index value of 7.3% over 33 years.

J	Solari, L; Parker, G				Solari, Luca; Parker, Gary			Morphodynamic modeling of the basal boundary of ice cover on brackish lakes	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												The analysis considers a cold-region brackish lake that develops an ice cover on its surface in winter. As the ice cover thickens due to freezing, black ice grows on the bottom side. The freezing process excludes the salt from the ice, resulting in an increase in dissolved salt concentration in the lake water just below the bottom of the ice. The density profile in this type of lake is then governed by two opposing factors: the water temperature distribution generally produces a stable stratification, whereas the excess salinity produced by exclusion tends to increase the density of the upper layers of the lake, resulting in an unstable contribution to stratification. Competition between these two factors can lead to unstable density gradients, so an initially motionless lake with a slowly thickening plane ice cover develops a convective flow field. This flow field can then feed back into the evolution of the morphology of the ice cover itself, resulting in a morphodynamic interaction between water and ice. This paper aims at investigating this morphodynamic instability. A mathematical model for the stability of a lake covered with an initially plane ice cover growing in time is proposed here. The results reveal threshold values of the main dimensionless parameters, expressed in the form of Rayleigh numbers, and in particular define a ratio between buoyancy effects and diffusivity that governs neutral stability conditions. When the system is unstable, i.e., for Rayleigh numbers above similar to 10(3) depending on the values of the input parameters, the analysis predicts the growth of convective flow circulation cells responsible for the morphodynamic evolution of the ice-water interface.

J	Huang, Y; Xiao, WH; Zhou, YY				Huang, Ya; Xiao, Weihua; Zhou, Yuyan			The Potential Impact of the Three Gorges Reservoir on Regional Extreme Precipitation-A Sensitivity Study	REMOTE SENSING												Understanding the potential impact of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) on regional extreme precipitation and its mechanisms is critical for the safe operation of the reservoir and the efficient management of regional water resources. This study uses the regional climate model RegCM4 to conduct a double-nested simulation experiment (50 km to 10 km) from 1989 to 2012, evaluated against the CN5.1 observation dataset. Sensitivity experiments with three different lake area ratios (0%, 20% and 100%) were performed using the sub-grid partitioning method in the Community Land Model Version 4.5 to analyze the spatiotemporal distribution, intensity, and frequency of precipitation under varying TGR water areas. The results show that with a 20% lake area ratio, precipitation slightly decreases, but the impact on extreme precipitation indices is not statistically significant. However, with a 100% lake area ratio, significant decreases in both total and extreme precipitation indices occur. The reduction is primarily driven by the formation of anomalous mountain-valley circulation between the TGR and surrounding mountains, which leads to atmospheric subsidence and reduced convective activity. These findings indicate that while the TGR has a negligible impact on extreme precipitation under its current configuration, the exaggerated sensitivity experiments reveal potential mechanisms and localized effects. This research enhances the understanding of the TGR's influence on regional extreme precipitation and provides valuable insights for water resource management and reservoir operation.

Energy Density and Dry Matter Content in Fish: New Observations and an Evaluation of Some Empirical Models	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Energy density (ED) is an indicator of fish nutritional status, physiological status, and fitness. Estimates of ED of predators and prey are also needed for bioenergetics modeling, but direct measurements of ED are difficult to obtain. Hence, investigators often borrow published values from the same species or related species. Alternatively, models have been developed that predict ED from dry matter content (DM). The scarcity of published ED values makes data borrowing and the generality of predictive modeling difficult to evaluate. We report new ED measurements derived from bomb calorimetry for six freshwater fish species (Arctic Char Salvelinus alpinus, Brown Trout Salmo trutta, kokanee Oncorhynchus nerka, Lake Trout Salvelinus namaycush, Rainbow Trout O. mykiss, and White Sucker Catostomus commersonii) and compared them to previously published data. We used our data to validate existing ED: DM models and to fit new ones. We also quantified bias that could result from borrowing inappropriate ED values for bioenergetics modeling. We collected a range of fish sizes from two reservoirs of differing productivity and measured whole-body ED (wet-mass basis) and DM. Our data substantially increase the range of ED data for Arctic Char, kokanee, and White Suckers. Two multispecies ED: DM models predicted the ED of our samples accurately (mean root mean square error [RMSE] < 500 J/g), even at the extremes for the range of prediction where data used for model development were limited. Taxon-specific models performed less well (mean RMSE = 775 J/g), and some appeared highly biased (RMSE 956-1,900 J/g). Bioenergetics model simulations showed that Lake Trout prey consumption could be overestimated by as much as 22% when using borrowed EDs for Lake Trout and their prey, but prey consumption estimates fell within +/- 2% of observed when ED was predicted from DM. When direct measures of ED are unattainable, measurement of DM and prediction of ED from one of the published multispecies models offer a practical and accurate method for bioenergetics modeling and other studies requiring information on fish energy content.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					2017	146	6					1262	1278		10.1080/00028487.2017.1360392	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2017.1360392													WOS:000417033600001

In stratified lakes with anoxic hypolimnetic waters, mineralisation proceeds by anaerobic respiration using terminal electron acceptors (TEAs) other than O-2. In past work, hypolimnetic oxygen consumption has been estimated from vertical concentration profiles of redox-active dissolved species in the water column and the underlying sediment. Electron transfer to and from particulate mineral and organic phases in the sediments was, however, not accounted for, mainly because of methodological constraints. In this work we use an electrochemical approach, mediated electrochemical analysis, to directly quantify changes in the redox states of particulate geochemical phases in a lake sediment. In mesocosm incubations, sediments were subjected to shifting oxygen availability similar to conditions during and after lake overturn events. The temporal redox dynamics of both dissolved and particulate phases in sediments were monitored at a high spatial resolution. We used a combination of experimental and modelling approaches to couple the observed changes in the redox state of dissolved and particulate species in the sediment to the oxygen turnover in the overlying water column. For the studied freshwater sediment, the amount of O-2 consumed during the re-oxidation of these phases in the top 21 mm of the sediment after switching from hypoxic to oxic conditions corresponded to similar to 50% of the total sediment oxygen consumption that was estimated from in-lake measurements after the onset of summer stratification. We found that solid phases in the sediments play a more profound role in electron accepting processes than previously considered. Based on these results, we propose that the herein presented analytical method offers the possibility to constrain parameters in theoretical models that simulate benthic redox dynamics including the electron transfer to and from geochemical phases in the sediments.					; Lau, Maximilian/MIN-4633-2025; Sander, Michael/J-7509-2012	Lau, Maximilian Peter/0000-0002-0675-663X; Sander, Michael/0000-0003-3383-2041													1448-2517	1449-8979					2016	13	5					826	837		10.1071/EN15217	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/EN15217													WOS:000384432600006

Water Quality Index (WQI) based on the World Health Organization's standards specified for drinking water and Water Quality Control Regulations in Turkey (WQCR), as well as certain multi-statistical methods, were used in analyzing the water quality. Material and methods Water samples were collected from 5 stations selected in the lake on monthly basis in 2019 and 30 water quality parameters were measured in total. Water Quality Index (WQI), Factor Analysis (FA), and Cluster Analysis (CA) were used in order to determine the differences between the spatial and temporal quality levels and to classify the investigated locations. Results and conclusions According to data observed, Boyali Dam Lake was found to have Class I and Class II water quality. In general, the WQI results obtained suggested that, although the water quality was found to significantly decrease in summer months, the reservoir was found to have an "A Grade - Excellent" water quality (< 50) in all the months and stations analyzed here. WQI values recorded in the dam lake ranged between 16.4 and 27.8 and the detected limnologic parameters did not exceed the standards specified for drinking water in any of the investigated months and stations (< 50 for WQI). As a result of FA, 3 factors explained 88.9% of total variances and as a result of CA, 2 statistical clusters were formed.

Factors driving bumble bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Bombus) and butterfly (Lepidoptera: Rhopalocera) use of sheared shrubland and young forest communities of the western Great Lakes	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												In the northern Great Lakes region, the creation and maintenance of early-successional woody communities as wildlife habitat have increasingly become a conservation priority. The extent to which insect pollinators use these systems remains largely anecdotal. In summer (June-August) of 2021, we surveyed 49 early-successional sites in the western Great Lakes region treated with either shrub-shearing or silviculture (young forest) for bumble bees, butterflies, and habitat components (i.e., structural vegetation and floral resources). Hierarchical distance models predicted pollinator densities ((gimel) over cap) to be, on average, (gimel) over cap = 84 bumble bees/ha and (gimel) over cap = 102 butterflies/ha. Although sheared shrubland and young forest communities supported comparable densities of bumble bees and butterflies, density was not equal across all sites. At the microhabitat scale, butterfly density and morphospecies richness were negatively associated with tall shrub cover and butterfly morphospecies richness (but not density) was driven by floral richness. Similarly, bumble bee density was positively associated with metrics of floral resources, underscoring the importance of blooming plants within these woody systems. Landscape covariates explained variation in butterfly density/richness but not bumble bee density. Ultimately, our results demonstrate that blooming plant abundance is an important driver of bumble bee and butterfly densities within these managed early-successional communities. Because early-successional woody communities are dynamic and their herbaceous openings are ephemeral, routine management would ensure that a variety of successional conditions exist on the landscape to meet the needs of bumble bees, butterflies, and potentially other insect pollinators.

Low radon-222 concentrations (below background levels) and enriched amounts of oxygen-18 and deuterium in ground water indicate mixing with surface water in parts of the basin. Comparison of surface water and regional ground water flow patterns indicate that boundaries for ground water basins typically do not coincide with surface water drainage subbasins. There are several areas in the basin where around water flow that originates outside of the Suwannee River basin crosses surface water basin boundaries during both low-flow and high-flow conditions. In a study area adjacent to the Suwannee River that consists predominantly of agricultural land use, 18 wells tapping the Upper Floridan aquifer and 7 springs were sampled three times during 1990 through 1994 for major dissolved inorganic constituents, trace elements, and nutrients. During a period of above normal rainfall that resulted in high river stage and high ground water levels in 1991, the combination of increased amounts of dissolved organic carbon and decreased levels of dissolved oxygen in ground water created conditions favorable for the natural reduction of nitrate by denitrification reactions in the aquifer. As a result, less nitrate was discharged by ground water to the Suwannee River.																			0043-1370					DEC	1997	33	6					1237	1254		10.1111/j.1752-1688.1997.tb03549.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.1997.tb03549.x													WOS:000071498000008
J	Schneider, RL; Negley, TL; Wafer, C				Schneider, RL; Negley, TL; Wafer, C			Factors influencing groundwater seepage in a large, mesotrophic lake in New York	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Groundwater seepage is gaining recognition as a critical feature of lake shoreline environments, yet our understanding of this process is complicated by the considerable spatial heterogeneity observed in flow rates within and among lakes. This research investigated spatial patterns in groundwater seepage around the shoreline of Oneida Lake, a 207 km(2) lake located in central New York, USA. Replicated, shielded seepage meters, with associated controls, were used to quantify rates and directions of groundwater flow along a 120 m stretch of shoreline throughout the summers of 1997-1999. These reference meters exhibited an average flow rate of 72 ml m(-2) h(-1) (n = 840; SE= 5) with individual flow rates as high as 1200 ml m(-2) h(-1). Additional meters, monitored in 1998, indicated that seepage patterns were highly synchronous but increased in magnitude of flow rate with increasing distances offshore up to 100 m from shore. In 1999, private landowners assisted in weekly monitoring of seepage meters at 28 additional sites distributed around the 88 km perimeter of Oneida Lake. The highest groundwater flow rates, averaging 100 ml m(-2) h(-1), consistendy occurred along the northern and eastern shorelines; lowest flow rates, including areas of groundwater recharge, occurred along the western and southwestern shorelines, proximal to the lake's outlet. Spatial patterns in groundwater flow were surprisingly unrelated to substrate texture despite wide variability observed around the lake edge, from silty-clays, to sands, gravels and boulders. Broad-scale factors of underlying bedrock geology and regional precipitation patterns appear to be driving the observed spatial patterns in Oneida Lake's groundwater contributions.

J	Young, MJ; Gawthorpe, RL; Sharp, IR				Young, MJ; Gawthorpe, RL; Sharp, IR			Sedimentology and sequence stratigraphy of a transfer zone coarse-grained delta, Miocene Suez Rift, Egypt	SEDIMENTOLOGY												This study focuses on Miocene sedimentation and stratigraphic evolution in a major transfer zone at the northern tip of the Thal Fault segment, Gulf of Suez. The succession generally shoals upwards from offshore mudstone containing pro-delta turbidites, into conglomeratic delta foresets and topsets, with sandstone-dominated shoreface facies coexisting laterally. Despite this upward shoaling, key stratal surfaces marking abrupt changes in relative sea-level allow the succession to be divided into four stratal units. The stacking pattern of the stratal units suggests an initial relative sea-level rise that generated a major marine flooding surface. A relative sea-level fall followed, resulting in widespread exposure and incision. During the ensuing relative sea-level rise a lowstand coarse-grained delta and coeval shoreface succession prograded several kilometres basinward. The stratigraphic development of the transfer zone delta is in marked contrast to that of aggradationally stacked deltas that occur near the centre of the Baba-Sidri fault segment, further south. At the transfer zone, low rates of subsidence and accommodation development coupled with a high sediment supply derived from a large fault tip drainage catchment have produced a strongly progradational delta subject to marked changes in relative sea-level. In the fault centre location, however, higher rates of accommodation development coupled with lower rates of sediment supply from footwall catchments have produced aggradationally stacked deltas. The results from this study have implications for sequence stratigraphic models and hydrocarbon exploration within extensional basins.

V.; Kuzmin, M., I			The First Reconstructions of Vegetation and Climate Changes in the Central Part of the Oka Plateau (East Sayan Mountains) in the Middle-Late Holocene	DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES												The Central part of the Oka Plateau lying in the East Sayan Mountains is still a poorly studied area of southern Siberia as regards its paleogeography. This gap can be partially replenished by the results of the present study. This study is focused on reconstruction of the central Oka Plateau environment in the Middle-Late Holocene. The pollen from bottom sediments of Sagan-Nur Lake provided a qualitative reconstruction of the vegetation in the catchment area of the lake as well as the quantitative reconstruction of dominant vegetation types obtained via the biomization method. The reconstruction suggests the dominance of the tundra vegetation consisting of dwarf birch, alder, and willow with patches of spruce and larch between about 8120 and 7000 cal. yr BP. The climate was sharp continental with high soil moisture resulting from summer permafrost thaw. The expansion of the forest biome began in the Central Oka Plateau at about 7000 cal. yr BP due to climate warming, hydrological network reconstruction resulting from complete thaw of regional glaciers and degradation of the permafrost rocks. Around 3200 cal. yr BP, the larch forests with the participation of Siberian pine started spreading across the Sagan-Nur Lake catchment area, thus suggesting colder conditions than before. The obtained reconstructions can help identifying the promising lakes and their catchment areas in the East Sayan Mountains for potential sustainable development through special projects (e.g., educational, tourist, environmentally protected).

Assessing spatial and temporal patterns of canopy decline across a diverse montane landscape in the Klamath Mountains, CA, USA using a 30-year Landsat time series	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												Context Tree mortality is of considerable concern, but the magnitude and extent of forest canopy decline are relatively unknown in landscapes with high levels of topographic complexity, spatial heterogeneity, and species diversity. We assessed 30 years of canopy decline, including a 5-year period characterized by extreme drought, in one of North America's most diverse landscapes in the Klamath Mountains of northern California, USA. Objectives (1) Characterize tree mortality by species, (2) Quantify temporal and spatial patterns of remotely-sensed canopy decline in relation to climate, (3) Compare canopy decline among vegetation types, topographic settings, and stand structural classes during drought. Methods We characterized tree mortality by species with field data and quantified the role of climate on canopy decline with a 30-year Landsat time series. We assessed and compared the role of topography and stand structure on canopy decline during drought. Results Most tree mortality and canopy decline occurred at higher elevations in Shasta red fir (Abies magnifica var. shastensis) and subalpine forests. Annual area of canopy decline was positively correlated with summer temperature and minimum vapor pressure deficit but not precipitation. The area of canopy decline was three times greater during the drought. The magnitude of decline was greatest at higher elevations, on more exposed, southwestern slopes, and in stands with old-growth structure. Stands in valleys and low slopes experienced relatively little decline. Conclusions Our study demonstrates the vulnerability of high elevation, old-growth forests to increasing temperature and suggests the potential for refugia from drought in diverse, heterogeneous landscapes.

J	Walsby, AE; Ng, G; Dunn, C; Davis, PA				Walsby, AE; Ng, G; Dunn, C; Davis, PA			Comparison of the depth where Planktothrix rubescens stratifies and the depth where the daily insolation supports its neutral buoyancy	NEW PHYTOLOGIST												Comparisons were made of the depths where the cyanobacterium Planktothrix rubescens stratified in lakes and the depths where the daily insolation supported neutral buoyancy of the organism. The percentage of filaments floating and sinking were measured in cultures grown under light : dark cycles at different irradiances. Q(n), the daily insolation for neutral buoyancy, was determined as that at which 50% of the filaments were floating, averaged over the 24-h period. For P. rubescens 9316 from Lake urich, Q(n) was 0.28 mol m(-2); during the summer period of stratification in Lake Zurich, the neutral buoyancy depth (z(n)) at which this insolation occurred varied between 5 and 14 m, depending on cloud cover and light attenuation. The weekly mean depth of the Planktothrix population maximum (z(p)) was usually within 1 m of the mean z(n). For P. rubescens 9972 from Blelham Tarn, Q(n) was 0.51 mol m(-2); during the stratified period in Blelham Tarn, z(n) varied between 2.3 and 6.2 m, also similar to z(p); the shallower stratification depth is explained by the steeper light attenuation. The depth at which Planktothrix stratifies in lakes is therefore explained by buoyancy regulation in relation to the irradiance. Metalimnetic stratification occurs only when z(n) exceeds the mixed depth, z(m); when z(m) > z(n), the organism becomes entrained in the surface mixed layer.																			0028-646X	1469-8137				APR	2004	162	1					133	145		10.1111/j.1469-8137.2004.01020.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2004.01020.x													WOS:000220175300013
J	Livingstone, DM				Livingstone, DM			Impact of secular climate change on the thermal structure of a large temperate central European lake	CLIMATIC CHANGE												Strong climate-related secular trends are apparent in a 52-yr long (1947-1998) uninterrupted series of monthly temperature profiles from Lake Zurich, a large, deep (136 m), temperate lake on the Swiss Plateau. Decadal mean water temperatures have undergone a secular increase at all depths, reflecting the high degree of regional warming that occurred in the European Alpine area during the 20th century. From the 1950s to the 1990s, high warming rates (similar to0.24 K per decade) in the uppermost 20 m of the take (i.e., the epi/metalimnion) combined with lower warming rates (similar to0.13 K per decade) below 20 m (i.e., in the hypolimnion), have resulted in a 20% increase in thermal stability and a consequent extension of 2-3 weeks in the stratification period. In common with many other parts of the world, 20th-century climate change on the Swiss Plateau has involved a steep secular increase in daily minimum (nighttime) air temperatures, but not in daily maximum (daytime) air temperatures. With respect to both secular change and decadal-scale variability, the temporal structure of the temperature of the surface mixed layer of Lake Zurich faithfully reflects that of the regional daily minimum air temperature, but not that of the daily maximum. The processes responsible for longer-term changes in the temperature structure of the lake therefore act during the night, presumably by suppressing nighttime convective cooling of the surface mixed layer. Application of a one-box heat exchange model suggests that the observed secular changes in thermal structure are due to shifts in the nighttime rate of emission of infrared radiation from the atmosphere and in the nighttime rates of latent and sensible heat exchange at the air-water interface. The increase in hypolimnetic temperatures is mainly a result of the increased prevalence of warm winters in Europe.																			0165-0009	1573-1480				MAR	2003	57	1-2					205	225		10.1023/A:1022119503144	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1022119503144													WOS:000181340200011
J	Robinson, CT; Jolidon, C; Lods-Crozet, B				Robinson, Christopher T.; Jolidon, Christa; Lods-Crozet, Brigitte			Long-term patterns of stream macroinvertebrates in an alpine cirque landscape	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Alpine landscapes are notable regarding their sensitivity to environmental change. Surface waters are especially sensitive as many are influenced by glacial meltwaters that are diminishing with the retreat of glaciers worldwide. The Macun Lakes region, Swiss National Park, is an alpine cirque landscape housing a number of lakes interconnected by streams. The area has been non-glaciated for decades, although rock glaciers are still present in the south basin. Surface waters, 10 stream sites in the present study, have been monitored in mid-summer since the year 2001 for physico-chemistry, periphyton and macroinvertebrates (including 74 species of chironomids). Water physico-chemistry revealed that the two main basins in the catchment differed, reflecting the inputs of rock glacier waters in the south basin. However, trends suggest that waters are becoming more similar as rock glacier inputs diminish over time along with a general decrease in nitrogen levels in all waters. Periphyton biomass showed some spatial differences among sites and a general decrease after 2010. Macroinvertebrate assemblages, including chironomids, clearly differed among basins and spatially along the stream network in each basin. Notably, no significant temporal trend was observed in the long-term data for macroinvertebrates, including chironomids, at the monitored sites. The results suggest that lotic macroinvertebrates may be buffered by the interconnectedness of streams and lakes in the landscape, which mitigates major response patterns of running waters to environmental change.																			1015-1621	1420-9055				OCT	2024	86	4							91	10.1007/s00027-024-01106-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-024-01106-6													WOS:001278969900001

Integrating scales and LTER methods to better understand the overall dynamics of a mountain protected space: the Ordesa and Monte Perdido National Park	ECOSISTEMAS												The Ordesa and Monte Perdido National Park and the Pyrenean Institute of Ecology (CSIC) recently joined the Spanish LTER network. As part of our strategy to understand recent changes in this protected area, we are carrying out a number of projects to evaluate changes at different spatio-temporal scales, using a variety of methods and approaches. We highlight here some of the most consolidated ones: long-term reconstructions from sedimentary lake records and cave speleothemes, the dynamics of one of the few active Iberian glaciers, the physico-chemical components of alpine streams, springs and lakes, the fingerprint of climatic change from ancient trees, changes in the composition and structure of biodiversity of alpine communities, natural and man-made grasslands at different altitudes, and the treeline, and population dynamics of endangered species or habitat indicators. The ecological monitoring shows that changes in both climate and land use, are having a strong influence in the physiognomy and structure of some of the most iconic and abundant habitats in the National Park. However, we found an important spatial variability in some processes, and also that others do not fit the established paradigms. The integration of partial results obtained from different methodologies and approaches diminishes the importance of each perception separately, helps to evaluate current changes in a long-term framework (geological scale), and will serve to validate the forecasts when modeling future environmental scenarios.

The varying impact of the summer monsoon across the Tibetan (Qinghai-Xizang) Plateau provides a strong gradient in precipitation, resulting in lakes of different salinity. Diatoms have been shown to indicate changes in salinity. Thus, transfer functions for diatoms and salinity or related environmental variables represent an excellent tool for paleoclimatic reconstructions in the Tibetan Plateau. Forty freshwater to hypersaline lakes (salinity: 0.1 to 91.7 g(-1)) were investigated in the eastern Tibetan Plateau. The relationship between 120 diatom taxa and conductivity, maximum water depth and major ions were analyzed using an indicator value approach, ordination and taxon response models. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that conductivity was the most important variable, accounting for 10.8% of the variance in the diatom assemblages. In addition water depth and weathering were influential. Weighted Averaging (WA) and Weighted Averaging Partial Least Square (WA-PLS) regression and calibration models were used to establish diatom-conductivity and water depth transfer functions. An optimal two-component WA-PLS model provided a high jack-knifed coefficient of prediction for conductivity (r(jack)(2) = 0.92), with a moderate root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEPjack = 0.22), a very low mean bias (0.0003), and a moderate maximum bias (0.26). AWA model with tolerance downweighting resulted in a slightly lower r(jack)(2) (0.89) for water depth, with RMSEPjack = 0.26, mean bias = -0.0103 and maximum bias = 0.26.																			0921-2728					JUL	2003	30	1					1	19		10.1023/A:1024703012475	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1024703012475													WOS:000184172900001

During the fall of 1992 fertilized eggs taken from a lacustrine population, Travaillant Lake, and an anadromous population, Arctic Red River, were reared tinder the same conditions in the laboratory. To measure the effects of sire and dam and to provide representative variability I created sixteen families by crossing 4 males and 4 females within each population. Hatch occurred in February 1993. 1 measured damp weight and fork length of each family for each population at 7 months from hatch, I I months, 14 months, 19 months, 23 months and 26 months of age. The experiment was terminated because density levels between the tanks became uneven so that growth effects could not be distinguished from tank density effects. The anadromous form exhibited significantly greater gain in weight and length than the lacustrine form. Significant effects from sire and dam were observed in some intervals. These results correspond to the field observation that the anadromous form had faster growth early in its life compared to the lacustrine; later growth was slower. These results Suggest that the difference in growth in the early life history have a genetic basis.																			0071-1128		3-510-47059-1				2002	57						497	506																WOS:000180355400042

Wolf in sheep's clothing: Effects of predation by small-bodied fish on survival and behaviour of salamander larvae	ECOSCIENCE												Fish can affect amphibian larvae directly through consumption or indirectly by eliciting antipredator behaviours that incur fitness costs. Because of predation, long-toed salamanders (Ambystoma macrodactylum) typically show an allotopic distribution with fish. Linnet Lake (Waterton Lakes National Park, Alberta, Canada) represents the unusual situation in which salamanders coexist with a small-bodied cyprinid, lake chub (Couesius plumbeus). However, the salamander population resident to Linnet Lake has declined in recent years. Our objective was to assess the role of lake chub in the decline of this salamander population by combining field observations and laboratory experiments. We used mark-recapture techniques to estimate the size of the 2 populations. We found little evidence of successful salamander reproduction, and the adult population had decreased by 60% in 14 y. In contrast, a large population of lake chub was present. Experiments showed that lake chub between 70 and 100 mm could consume salamander larvae < 40 mm in length. Larvae responded to the presence of lake chub by reducing activity and increasing refuge use, especially during the day. Our study is one of few to document the ability of a native small-bodied fish to consume amphibian larvae. The coexistence of fish and salamanders may result from a dynamic interplay between periodic extirpation of fish by winter hypoxia and of salamanders by predation, punctuated by episodes of re-colonization or strong recruitment.																			1195-6860						2011	18	1					70	78		10.2980/18-1-3395	http://dx.doi.org/10.2980/18-1-3395													WOS:000289116500009

The basal sediments, which are dominated by glacial and glaciofluvial clastic sediments, attest to a Late Pleistocene deglaciation of the lake basin. These sediments are overlain by 2.70 m of laminated algal and microbial mats and a few interspersed moss layers. Radiocarbon dating, conducted on bulk organic carbon of 12 samples throughout the organic sequence, provides a reliable chronology since the onset of biogenic accumulation at c. 12,400 cal. year BP. Successful diatom colonization, however, was probably hampered by extensive ice and snow cover on the lake and restricted input of nutrients until 10,200 cal. year BP. A subsequent increase of nutrient supply culminated between 8600 and 8200 cal. year BP and is related to warm summer temperatures and reduced albedo in the catchment. Warm conditions lasted until 6700 cal. year BP, supporting the establishment of a diatom community. Colder temperatures from 6700 cal. year BP culminated in several periods between 6200 and 3700 cal. year BP, when high amounts of sulphur and low abundances of diatoms were deposited due to a perennial ice and snow cover on the lake. During the late Holocene, relatively warm conditions between 3200 and 2300 cal. year BP and between 1500 to 1000 cal. year BP, respectively, indicated by high accumulation of organic matter and reducing bottom water conditions, were interrupted and followed by colder periods.					; Melles, Martin/J-4070-2012; Wagner, Bernd/J-4682-2012	Wagner, Bernd/0000-0002-1369-7893; Melles, Martin/0000-0003-0977-9463; Hultzsch, Nadja/0000-0001-5545-8412; Gore, Damian/0000-0002-0377-8518													0921-2728					NOV	2004	32	4					321	339		10.1007/s10933-004-0143-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-004-0143-8													WOS:000225904400002

In addition to pollution emission level and location, meteorological factors affect the distribution of extreme pollution, so analysing the weather fields under extreme pollution is of great significance to predict extreme pollution. In this study, based on PM2.5 and O-3 atmospheric composition monitoring data from China National Environmental Monitoring Center (CNEMC) Network and daily meteorological data from Version 2 of Climate Forecast System of National Centers for Environmental Protection (NCEP) Climate Forecast System, the distribution types of wintertime PM2.5 and summertime O-3 pollution in China from 2015 to 2019 were classified with Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) method, and the types of weather characteristics were analyzed, respectively. The results showed that the distribution of extreme pollution and the distribution of meteorological fields had a good correspondence. High PM2.5 was accompanied with high relative humidity (RH), higher temperature (T), low pressures (P) and low wind speeds (W). The two maximum centers of correlation coefficients between PM2.5 and the atmospheric circulation field were located on Siberia and the east of Japan. High O-3 was accompanied with dry environments and higher temperature. O-3 contaminated areas were accompanied with low pressures, while the correlation with wind speeds were not so significant. Ocean cyclones seriously affected O-3 pollution levels in the south and along the coast. The two maximum centers of correlation coefficients between O-3 mass concentration and 500 hPa geopotential height were located on the east of Lake Baikal and southern China. The relevant indexes established in the key areas had all passed the significance test and had an indicative significance for forecasting the pollution level. We believe that the apparent correlations between PM2.5(O-3) and RH, T, as well as W related to the external factors associated with the life cycle of midlatitude mesoscale weather system, rather than the underlying direct internal cause.

Invasiveness of an introduced species: the role of hybridization and ecological constraints	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Introduced species are confronted with new environments to which they need to adapt. However, the ecological success of an introduced species is generally difficult to predict, especially when hybridizations may be involved in the invasion success. In western Europe, the lake frog Pelophylax ridibundus appears to be particularly successful. A reason for this species' success might be the presence of the invader's genetic material prior to the introduction in the form of a hybrid between P. ridibundus and a second indigenous water frog species. These hybrids reproduce by hybridogenesis, only transmitting the ridibundus genome to gametes and backcrossing with the indigenous species (i.e. P. lessonae). This reproductive system allows the hybrid to be independent from P. ridibundus, and allows the ridibundus genome to be more widely spread than the species itself. Matings among hybrids produce newly formed P. ridibundus offspring (N), if the genomes are compatible. Therefore, we hypothesize that hybridogenesis increases the invasiveness of P. ridibundus (1) by enhancing propagule pressure through N individuals, and/or (2) by increasing adaptation of invaders to the native water frogs' habitat through hybrid-derived ridibundus genomes that are locally adapted. We find support for the first hypothesis because a notable fraction of N tadpoles is viable. However, in our semi-natural experiments they did not outperform ridibundus tadpoles in the native water frogs' habitat, nor did they differ physiologically. This does not support the second hypothesis and highlights ecological constraints on the invasion. However, we cannot rule out that these constraints may fall with ongoing selection, making a replacement of indigenous species highly probable in the future.

Assessment of Atmospheric Particles Flux Variation on the Different Underlying Surfaces (Grasslands and Forest) in the Lake Baikal Region	ATMOSPHERE												In this study, the new data of experimental studies of the atmospheric particulate matter (PM) on the south-eastern coast of Lake Baikal (station Boyarsky) were analyzed in summer 2021. High-altitude measuring sites were arranged in the forest massif (mast, 16 m) and above the meadow vegetation (mast, 30 m). By the Giardina M. model and based on the measurements data the calculations of the deposition flux density of aerosol particles on forest and meadow vegetation were made. Our preliminary results of prediction obtained by Giardina M. model good agrees with measured dry deposition velocities across particle sizes. In the forest, the mass concentration of aerosol particles differs slightly from the mass concentrations in the grasslands and is equal on average 7.9 x 10-3 mg m-3 for the size particles below 200 nm (PM0.2) and 6.7 x 10-4 mg m-3 for particles in the size range from 0.2 to 10 mu m (PM0.2-10). However, we found that mass flux density of aerosol particle is almost 4.8 times higher under forest canopy than in meadow vegetation. In addition, the leaf area index (LAI), which characterize the effective area of particle deposition, is also significantly higher in the tree canopy (5.6) compared to the grassland vegetation (2.4).

J	Cremona, F; Planas, D; Lucotte, M				Cremona, Fabien; Planas, Dolors; Lucotte, Marc			Influence of functional feeding groups and spatiotemporal variables on the δ15N signature of littoral macroinvertebrates	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The delta N-15 trophic enrichment in littoral food webs is not well known despite the importance of macroinvertebrates in lacustrine energy fluxes. We wanted to assess the influence of functional feeding group (grazer, collector, shredder, predator, predator-hematophagous, predator-sucker) and spatiotemporal variables (year, month, station of sampling) on littoral macroinvertebrate delta N-15 signatures. For 2 years, during the plant growth period phytophilous littoral macroinvertebrates were sampled in Lake St. Pierre, a large fluvial lake of the St. Lawrence River, Qu,bec, Canada. The delta N-15 analyses showed that station was the most important factor for explaining delta N-15 variation, followed by sampling month and functional feeding group. The organisms sampled in the stations of the south shore, which experienced greater macrophyte abundance, slower currents, and stronger NO3 depletion exhibited higher delta N-15 values than those sampled on the north shore. Grazer-to-predator delta N-15 enrichment valued 1.6aEuro degrees, which is inferior to the 3.4aEuro degrees generally admitted in food-web research. Shredders exhibited the lowest delta N-15 values and predators-hematophagous the highest. delta N-15 signature of invertebrates increased 3aEuro degrees through the summer between May and September. Only samples collected within a short period should be pooled to avoid an error value equivalent to one trophic level (1.6) enrichment. Furthermore, it is recommended not to pool macroinvertebrate samples collected at stations with differing watershed land uses.					; Cremona, Fabien/D-1385-2013	Planas, Dolors/0000-0003-0901-2887; Cremona, Fabien/0000-0002-0559-6259; Lucotte, Marc/0000-0002-6360-2979													0018-8158					JUN	2010	647	1					51	61		10.1007/s10750-009-9798-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-009-9798-5													WOS:000277241700005

JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Phytoplankton in shallow urban lakes are influenced by various environmental factors. However, the long-term coupling effects and impact pathways of these environmental variables on phytoplankton remain unclear. This is an emerging issue due to high urbanization and the resultant complex climate, lake hydrology and morphology, human interference, and water quality parameter changes. This study used Tangxun Lake, the largest urban lake in the Yangtze River Economic Belt, as an example to assess for the first time the individual contributions and coupled effects of four environmental variables and fourteen indicators on chlorophyll-a (Chla) concentrations under two scenarios from 2000 to 2019. Additionally, the influence pathways between the environmental variables and Chla concentration were quantified. The results indicated that the Chla concentration was most affected by lake hydrology and morphology, as were the total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and transparency. Especially after urbanization (2015-2019), the coupling effect of human interference, lake hydrology and morphology, and water quality parameters was strongest (18%). This is mainly due to fluctuations in the lake water level and an increase in the shape index of lake morphology, large amounts of nutrients were input, which reduced lake transparency and indirectly changed the Chla content. In addition, due to the rapid development of Wuhan city, the expansion of construction land has led to an increase in impervious surface area and a decrease in lake area. During periods of intense summer rainfall, a substantial amount of pollutants entered the lakes through surface runoff, resulting in decreased lake transparency, and elevated concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus, indirectly increasing the Chla content. This study provides a scientific basis for aquatic ecological assessment and pollution control in urban shallow lakes.					; Wang, Qianyang/JVO-7150-2024	Yao, Xiao Lei/0000-0001-8186-5097; Wang, Qianyang/0000-0001-6186-4695; 													0301-4797	1095-8630				FEB	2024	351								119966	10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.119966	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.119966		JAN 2024						38171129					WOS:001151867400001

No. 1802 tailentry was used as the engineering background, located in the Danan Lake No. 5 mine in Xinjiang, China. The weakly cemented sandstone compositions were analyzed by using X-ray diffraction instrument. And the microstructure was observed by using a scanning electron microscope. The uniaxial compression experiment was carried out to investigate the mechanical characteristics by using MTS mechanics experimental system, and the uniaxial compressive strength, Poisson's ratio, and elastic modulus were obtained. The relationships between the mechanical parameters that include the mineral composition, microstructural characteristics, uniaxial compressive strength (UCS), elastic modulus, cohesion, and friction angle of the weakly cemented sandstone and the water content were obtained. The attenuation of the anchorage force of the weakly cemented surrounding rock under different water-rich conditions was studied. The key reason of No. 1802 tailentry surrounding rock structure deterioration and roof fall was found. The model of a single anchor structure was established based on FLAC(3D) to study the mechanical response of a single anchor structure under different water contents and the distribution and evolution laws of bearing stress field, effective compressive stress, and anchor axial force. The influences of parameters such as water content, pretightening force, and anchor length on the preload diffusion effect of weakly cemented surrounding rock anchorage structures are obtained. The key to controlling the deterioration of the surrounding rock structure of the weakly cemented entry is to reduce the water content of the roof. The research results provide reference for the control of the entry surrounding rock under similar stratum conditions.

Lange-Bert. (equivalent to Achnanthes haynaldii Schaarschm.) is a widely reported species from temperate and cold zones of southern and northern hemispheres despite being originally described from a high altitude stratovolcano (Antisana, 4100 m a.s.1.) in Ecuador (tropical climatic zone). Although widely cited in the literature, studies concerning the original material were never carried out. The main objective of this paper is to clarify the identity of Planothidium haynaldii and two related species from North-western USA and Antarctic environments. Methods - The original type slide of Achnanthes haynaldii Schaarschm. was observed. Additionally, selected samples containing populations currently identified either as Planothidium haynaldii or Achnanthes lanceolata var. capitata O.Mull. collected in Oregon (USA) and James Ross Island (Antarctica) were observed. The samples were analyzed using light (LM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Key results - A new species, commonly improperly identified as Planothidium haynaldii, is described as Planothidium amphibium C.E.Wetzel, Ector & L.Pfister sp. nov. from aerial and aquatic habitats of Oregon (USA). This species is widely distributed in the northern hemisphere according to illustrated literature records. Achnanthes lanceolata var. capitata is erected to species level and transferred to the genus Planothidium. Planothidium capitatum (O.Mull.) Van de Vijver, Kopalova, C.E.Wetzel & Ector comb. & stat. nov. seems to be an important component of the communities in the Antarctic region where large populations were found on James Ross Island and Livingston Island living in the epilithon and epipelon of large lakes. Finally, Planothidium haynaldii seems to be rarer than initially expected and its occurrence is confirmed only in the Andes mountain range in South America (recent freshwater sample from Ecuador and as fossil in Chile).

Assessment of the factors that influence small mammal fauna distribution in Southern Iberia during the latest Messinian by mean of stable isotopes	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Tropical conditions during the late Miocene in southwestern Europe influenced the continental environments. Although there are previous qualitative environmental interpretations of these continental landscapes during the late Miocene, quantitative environmental and paleohydrological data are scarce. A very long sequence of small mammals allowed to date the different continental drainage stages of the Granada Basin from latest Tortonian to the Holocene and to reconstruct qualitatively its environmental evolution. The study of the isotopic record of these fossil small mammals and sediments in the stratigraphic sequence of a latest Messinian paleo-lake in the Granada Basin has provided quantitative environmental and paleohydrological data, in order to know if the fluctuations in the faunal distribution were mainly influenced by the paleogeographic configuration, such as changes in the landscape of the basin, or by the climatic conditions. Open habitats with C3 plants predominated. Estimated quantitative data suggest an oxygen isotopic composition of meteoric waters ranging from -4.9 to -3.9 parts per thousand, past temperatures from similar to 2.5 degrees C to 4.7 degrees C higher than the current ones, and summer relative paleohumidity from similar to 60% to similar to 70%. In this context, changes in the landscape, such as the reduction of the lacustrine system caused by tectonic activity, would affect taxa with high dependence on humid conditions.

J	DOYLE, RD; FISHER, TR				DOYLE, RD; FISHER, TR			NITROGEN-FIXATION BY PERIPHYTON AND PLANKTON ON THE AMAZON FLOODPLAIN AT LAKE CALADO	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Nitrogen fixation by periphyton and plankton was measured on the Amazon floodplain using the acetylene reduction method calibrated with N-15-N2. The average ratio (+/- SD) of moles C2H4 reduced per mole N2-N fixed was 3.4 +/- 0.7, similar to other studies. Periphyton and plankton had high rates of light-dependent nitrogen fixation, with dark nitrogen fixation averaging 26% of the average rates in the light. The average daily (24 h) rates for periphyton nitrogen fixation in 1989 and 1990 were 1.79 and 0.51 mmol N2-N.m-1.d-1 respectively, which are comparable to summer rates in many temperate cyanobacterial assemblages. Nitrogen fixation was depressed at NO3- Concentrations as low as 0.5 muM, and was below detection limits at concentrations of 4 muM, which occurred during periods of river flooding. Planktonic nitrogen fixation rates were high (0.5-0.8 mmol N2-N.m-2.d-1) during the high-water and drainage phases of the annual hydrograph when the floodplain waters were draining towards the river (low NO3-), but rates were undetectable (< 0.05 mmol N2-N.m-2.d-1) when there was river flooding (high NO3-). Nitrogen fixation by periphyton and plankton in 1989-1990 accounted for approximately 8% of previously reported total annual nitrogen inputs to the floodplain at Lake Calado.																			0168-2563						1994	26	1					41	66		10.1007/BF02180403	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02180403													WOS:A1994PF77200003
J	Li, ZQ; Jiang, ZG; Beauchamp, G				Li, Zhongqiu; Jiang, Zhigang; Beauchamp, Guy			Nonrandom mixing between groups of Przewalski's gazelle and Tibetan gazelle	JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY												Przewalski's gazelle (Procapra przewalskii) and the Tibetan gazelle (P. picticaudata) are endemic, closely related, and endangered ungulates of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The 2 species often occur in mixed-species groups in the upper Buha River of the Plateau. We studied the composition and size of their mixed-species groups over 2 years to determine whether such groups aggregate by chance and to determine a posteriori potential costs and benefits associated with the formation of mixed-species groups. Sex composition and size distribution were similar in single-species groups for both species. Given that population density also was similar for these species, we expected that mixed-species groups that formed by chance would consist of an equal mix of the 2 species. This was true in male and in mixed-sex groups; however, the proportion of female groups composed of Przewalski's gazelles was much larger than expected. In addition, mixed-species groups in winter never included males of both species. The results suggest that these 2 gazelle species do not associate randomly. Mixed-species groups were larger than single-species all-female, all-male, and mixed-sex groups, suggesting that individuals in larger groups may benefit from a reduction in predation risk. The occurrence of mixed-sex, mixed-species groups may increase the risk of crossbreeding and represent a cost to the formation of mixed-species groups in these two gazelle species.

Under global warming, persistent glacier mass depletion within the SETP poses a risk to water resource security and sustainability in adjacent nations and regions. This study deployed a high-precision ICESat-2 satellite altimetry technique to evaluate SETP glacier thickness changes from 2018 to 2022. Our results show that the average change rate in glacier thickness in the SETP is -0.91 +/- 0.18 m/yr, and the corresponding glacier mass change is -7.61 +/- 1.52 Gt/yr. In the SETP, the glacier mass loss obtained via ICESat-2 data is larger than the mass change in total land water storage observed by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment follow-on satellite (GRACE-FO), -5.13 +/- 2.55 Gt/yr, which underscores the changes occurring in other land water components, including snow (-0.44 +/- 0.09 Gt/yr), lakes (-0.06 +/- 0.02 Gt/yr), soil moisture (1.88 +/- 1.83 Gt/yr), and groundwater (1.45 +/- 0.70 Gt/yr), with a closure error of -0.35 Gt/yr. This demonstrates that this dramatic glacier mass loss is the main reason for the decrease in total land water storage in the SETP. Generally, there are decreasing trends in solid water storage (glacier and snow) against stable or increasing trends in liquid water storage (lakes, soil moisture, and groundwater) in the SETP. This persistent decrease in solid water is linked to the enhanced melting induced by rising temperatures. Given the decreasing trend in summer precipitation, the surge in liquid water in the SETP should be principally ascribed to the increased melting of solid water.					; Shi, Zhen/AAG-1205-2019	Jiao, Jiashuang/0000-0002-7915-0575; 														2072-4292				MAR	2024	16	6							1048	10.3390/rs16061048	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs16061048													WOS:001192984200001
J	Gallagher, CP; Dick, TA				Gallagher, Colin P.; Dick, Terry A.			Ecological characteristics of ninespine stickleback Pungitius pungitius from southern Baffin Island, Canada	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Stable delta C-13 and delta N-15 isotopes, diet and parasites demonstrated that the prey consumed by ninespine stickleback Pungitius pungitius in a small lake on Baffin Island changed during the summer and also revealed intraspecific variation in their ecological niche. In July, there were differences in the diets of male and female ninespine stickleback as indicated by the stable isotopes, differences corroborated by the data on diet composition and the parasite fauna. Differences suggested that the sexes occupied different habitats during spawning. During July, females utilise the shallower littoral areas consuming zooplankton and benthic organisms, while males occupy deeper areas of the littoral zone feeding mainly on pelagic zooplankton. Parasite data support these observations as males had higher infections of copepod- transmitted parasites than females. There appeared to be no segregation of resources between males and females in late August, although the diet of both male and female ninespine stickleback shifted towards more benthic organisms, compared with July. Differences in delta C-13 isotope, diet composition and infections of co-occurring parasites demonstrated that sympatric ninespine stickleback and Arctic char Salvelinus alpinus captured in the littoral zone occupied separate niches. Ninespine stickleback preyed mainly on zooplankton and chironomids, while Arctic char consumed a greater variety of prey items, including zooplankton and larger-sized prey such as insects and ninespine stickleback. The multifaceted approach improved our understanding of the trophic ecology of ninespine stickleback in southern Baffin Island and quantified resource use and dietary overlap with Arctic char.																			0906-6691	1600-0633				DEC	2011	20	4					646	655		10.1111/j.1600-0633.2011.00516.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0633.2011.00516.x													WOS:000296448500017
J	Partanen, S; Luoto, M				Partanen, Sari; Luoto, Miska			Environmental determinants of littoral paludification in boreal lakes	LIMNOLOGICA												Numerical studies of the relationships between littoral processes and environmental variables are important because they provide understanding of the impacts of natural and human factors on lake systems. In this study, littoral paludification, its occurrence, types and main environmental determinants were studied in boreal lakes with varying size (41-560 km(2)) and total phosphorus content (4.5-35.5 mu g L-1) in Finland. The relative importance of catchment characteristics, water quality and water level regulation on paludification was analysed at the lake level (n = 20), whereas the importance of site morphology, soil quality and aquatic vegetation was analysed at the site level (n = 289). This study utilised two novel statistical methods in numerical analyses: generalised linear mixed models and variation partitioning (W). Bottom ward overgrowth was the main paludification type in the studied lakes. At the lake level, the magnitude of spring flooding and the altitude of the lake had a negative response to paludification, whereas the existence of water level regulation, cover of clay soil and total phosphorus content correlated positively to paludification. At the site level, the paludification was negatively related to slope angle, and positively to the occurrence of clay soil, Glyceria maxima (reed sweet-grass) and the abundance of eutrophy indicator species. However, a considerable amount of variation in littoral paludification both at lake and site levels was accounted for by the joint effects of predictors and may thus be causally related to two or all three groups of predictors.

Due to specific environmental conditions these pools are unique in the Czech Republic. Extremely high values of salinity (up to 11%) along with a low concentration of dissolved phosphorus (0.01-0.1 mg.l(-1)) are typical of some of the water in this area. The pools were grouped into three categories based on their conductivity values and treated using cow dung, municipal wastewater treatment sludge and inorganic NPK (nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium) fertilizer at doses recommended for carp ponds. The application of fertilizer had a positive effect on the density and biomass of all the groups in the macrozoobenthos. The highest and the lowest increases in macrozoobenthos biomass were recorded after the application of NPK and cow dung, respectively. However, the application of fertilizer had no effect on the diversity of macrozoobenthos. Chironomus aprilinus, recorded in the Czech Republic for the first time, inhabited all pools with conductivity ranges of between 5,000-16,000 mu S.cm(-1). The density of C. aprilinus larvae increased with increasing salinity reaching a maximum of about 17,083 ind.m(-2) (biomass - 82 g.m(-2)).

The development of remote sensing technology provides a new technical scheme for rapid and efficient extraction of cultivated land information. This article takes Dianchi Lake Basin as the research object to study the characteristics of cultivated land changes in Dianchi Lake Basin in the past 20 years. In the past 20 years, the distribution of cultivated land in the dianchi lake basin gradually changed from species concentration to decentralization, and showed a trend of gradually moving away from dianchi lake. Through the analysis of the dynamic attitude of land use, it is found that the cultivated land area in the dianchi basin has significantly changed between the land use in the past 20 years. From the perspective of the change trend and state index of single land use in the dianchi lake basin, the bidirectional transition of all land use in the region is frequent and extremely unbalanced. The area converted from cultivated land to non-cultivated land is larger than the area converted from non-cultivated land to this type. It develops towards the direction of scale reduction and is in the state of "falling trend".					lina, shi/KHD-7663-2024														1755-1307						2021	658								012006	10.1088/1755-1315/658/1/012006	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/658/1/012006													WOS:000685506000006

Namik			Climate proxies for the last 17.3 ka from Lake Hazar (Eastern Anatolia), extracted by independent component analysis of μ-XRF data	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL					Workshop on Paleoclimatic and Paleoecological Studies in Turkey's Lakes (TURQLAKES)	JUN 21-23, 2016	Ardahan Univ, Ardahan, TURKEY	Turkish Acad Sci	Ardahan Univ			The elemental composition of lake sediment cores is often the result of several independent processes. In this study we attempt to extract statistically independent climate related signals from mu-XRF multi element data of a core drilled from Lake Hazar in Eastern Anatolia, using the independent component analysis (ICA) method. In addition, we analysed ostracod shells for oxygen and carbon isotopes. The ICA method has advantages over traditional dimension reduction methods, such as principal component analysis or factor analysis, because it is based on maximal statistical independence rather than uncorrelatedness, where independence is a stronger property. The Hz11-P03 core, which represents the last 17.3 ka, was recovered from Lake Hazar which, at times, formed the headwaters of the Tigris. Applying the ICA method, we selected two out of six independent components by measuring distance correlation similarity. We propose that one of the selected components can be read as a proxy for temperature and the other for precipitation in this region. Our results indicate that the region was relatively cold and wet during the late glacial, between 17.3 and 14.8 ka BP, and wet and warm during Bolling-Allerod. The lake level dropped below today's level during the Younger Dryas stadial (12.49 and 11.76 ka BP), forming a marked hiatus in the core's stratigraphic record. During the beginning of the Holocene, while precipitation values were high, the temperature gradually increased until 8 ka BP. Between 8 and 5 ka BP, the region was warm but extremely dry. After 5 ka BP, around 3.5 ka BP temperatures suddenly fell, and three abrupt dry phases are observed around 3.5 ka and 2.8 ka and 1.8 ka BP. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Divergent Positive Selection in Rhodopsin from Lake and Riverine Cichlid Fishes	MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Studies of cichlid evolution have highlighted the importance of visual pigment genes in the spectacular radiation of the African rift lake cichlids. Recent work, however, has also provided strong evidence for adaptive diversification of riverine cichlids in the Neotropics, which inhabit environments of markedly different spectral properties from the African rift lakes. These ecological and/or biogeographic differences may have imposed divergent selective pressures on the evolution of the cichlid visual system. To test these hypotheses, we investigated the molecular evolution of the dim-light visual pigment, rhodopsin. We sequenced rhodopsin from Neotropical and African riverine cichlids and combined these data with published sequences from African cichlids. We found significant evidence for positive selection using random sites codon models in all cichlid groups, with the highest levels in African lake cichlids. Tests using branch-site and clade models that partitioned the data along ecological (lake, river) and/or biogeographic (African, Neotropical) boundaries found significant evidence of divergent selective pressures among cichlid groups. However, statistical comparisons among these models suggest that ecological, rather than biogeographic, factors may be responsible for divergent selective pressures that have shaped the evolution of the visual system in cichlids. We found that branch-site models did not perform as well as clade models for our data set, in which there was evidence for positive selection in the background. One of our most intriguing results is that the amino acid sites found to be under positive selection in Neotropical and African lake cichlids were largely nonoverlapping, despite falling into the same three functional categories: spectral tuning, retinal uptake/release, and rhodopsin dimerization. Taken together, these results would imply divergent selection across cichlid clades, but targeting similar functions. This study highlights the importance of molecular investigations of ecologically important groups and the flexibility of clade models in explicitly testing ecological hypotheses.

J	RAWSON, DS				RAWSON, DS			THE NET PLANKTON OF GREAT SLAVE LAKE	JOURNAL OF THE FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD OF CANADA												The net plankton of Great Slave Lake was studied extensively in the years 1944 to 1947 and sampling continued at a central station through 1954. Some 490 samples were taken using large nets and traps with No. 20 silk. Taxonomic, gravimetric and numerical analyses were reported and comparisons made between the larger, open lake and the deep, cold, east arm. Among 160 species of algae, two diatoms, Melosira islandica and Asterionella formosa were dominant. Green and blue-green algae were scanty but Dinobryon was numerous, especially in the cold, east arm. Among 26 rotifers Keratella cochlearis and Kellicottia longispina were dominant and four other species common. Cladocera were scarce but the copepods made up about 85% of the plankton volume. Diaptomus spp., Cyclops spp., Limnocalanus macrurus, Epischura lacustris and Senecella calanoides were the main species. The average dry weight of the standing crop of net plankton in the open water was 21.8 kg/ha. The crop was heavier in years of warm water than in those of colder water. Occasional high turbidity was associated with decreased plankton. In Christie and McLeod Bays of the east arm, where the waters are deeper, colder and lower in mineral content, the average dry weight of plankton was 14.3 and 9.0 kg/ha. These amounts are typical of the plankton in large, very oligotrophic lakes. An early season maximum of diatoms and copepods was followed by a rapid decline in late July. The smaller, late-summer maximum included large numbers of rotifers. More than half of the plankton was in the upper 25 m with decreasing amounts down to 100 m. A thin plankton, mainly of copepods, extends down to 600 m. The dominant species of plankters in the open water of Great Slave Lake appear to be almost identical with those of Lake Winnipeg, Lake Nipigon and the Great Lakes. All have a diatom-copepod type of plankton with a constant group of rotifers and Dinobryon in moderate numbers. Green and blue-green algae are scanty except in the shallower and warmer lakes, Winnipeg and Erie.																									1956	13	1					53	127		10.1139/f56-006	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f56-006													WOS:A1956WX36400006

Viticulture in the Nagy Hill of Tokaj was founded more than eight centuries ago, however, due to economic crises and the phylloxera epidemic extension of the vineyards has fallen to less than one-half during 250 years; wetlands and grassland of the Taktakoz were changed by arable lands after river regulation and flood prevention performed in the second half of the 19th century; and traditional land use/land cover pattern of the East Borsod Coal Basin has been transformed by coal mining and industrialization from the end of the 19th century. On the basis of study on transformation of land use/land cover patterns, consequences concerning landscape planning of the studied areas can be drawn. (1) Vineyards of the Nagy Hill of Tokaj have represented a traditional land use category in the area for many centuries; therefore, re-plantation of the abandoned vineyards would be the reasonable purpose. (2) In the TaktakOz arable lands have become dominant land use elements. Although the recent land use pattern can be regarded as traditional, the ancient wetlands and grasslands could be, at least partly, restored by significant landscaping work. (3) In the East Borsod Coal Basin the extension of forest has spontaneously increased after the closure of coal mines, therefore, the pre-mining landscape pattern could be more-or-less restored without considerable landscape transforming action.					; Novák, Tibor József/A-2853-2016; Rozsa, Peter/O-8469-2019; Novak, Tibor Jozsef/A-2853-2016	Rozsa, Peter/0000-0002-6820-3563; Suto, Laszlo/0000-0002-5557-0188; Novak, Tibor Jozsef/0000-0002-5514-9035													1842-4090	1844-489X				JUL	2017	12	2					473	483																WOS:000402360400018
J	James, WF; Barko, JW; Eakin, HL; Helsel, DR				James, WF; Barko, JW; Eakin, HL; Helsel, DR			Distribution of sediment phosphorus pools and fluxes in relation to alum treatment	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												The distribution of sediment physical characteristics, sediment phosphorus (P) pools, and laboratory-based rates of P release from the sediments were used to identify regions and dosage for alum treatment in Wind Lake, Wisconsin. Using variations in sediment moisture content, we identified an erosional zone at depths < 1.4 m and an accumulation zone at depths > 2.6 m. Mean concentrations of porewater P, loosely-bound P, iron- and aluminum-bound P, and mean rates of P release from sediments under anoxic conditions were high in the accumulation zone compared to sediment P characteristics in the erosional zone, indicating focusing of readily mobilized sediment P pools from shallow regions and accumulation to deep regions. We determined that a future alum treatment for control of internal P loading would be most effective at depths > 2.6 in the accumulation zone. The mean rate of anoxic P release from sediments encountered in the accumulation zone (8.3 mg m(-2) d(-1)) was used in conjunction with a summer anoxic period of 122 d, and a treatment area of 1.6 km(2) to estimate an internal P load of 1,600 kg to be controlled. Our results suggest that an understanding of the distribution of sediment P pools and P fluxes in lakes provides a strategy for estimating alum dosage and application areas.																			1093-474X	1752-1688				JUN	2000	36	3					647	656		10.1111/j.1752-1688.2000.tb04294.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2000.tb04294.x													WOS:000087844600016

DISCUSSION OF ITS DISTRIBUTION AND CIRCULATION IN SOUTHERN PATAGONIA	MAGALLANIA												The Campo del Lago 4 site is located in the wintering grounds of the Bon Accord ranch on the Southern shore of Lake Argentino (upper basin of the Santa Cruz River). Based on a very high frequency of veined greenish-gray obsidian (OGVV) artifacts and tools made from this and other lithic raw materials also of very good and excellent quality for knapping, the particularities of this site are presented in the context of the South bank of Lake Argentino and the conditions for obtaining the OGVV are evaluated. Its circulation on a supraregional scale is discussed compared to two other obsidians, green and black, also present at the site but at a much lower frequency. The circulation of the OGVV shows a bimodal distribution curve whose extremes correspond to the Southern margin of Lake Argentino and the Pali-Aike volcanic field. In the first case, proximity to the source of origin would have resulted in direct, opportunistic and unusual access, while in Pali-Aike volcanic field, the supply would have been indirect and was obtained by circulation of flakes and/or nodules. Based on the regional artifactual representation, the source of the OGVV was either spatially constrained or, moreover, very focal. The OGVV was just another excellent quality rock in the panoply of those available for knapping; hunter-gatherer systems-both on a regional and supra-regional scale-did not ignore it when the circumstances arose, but they would not have required it too much.																			0718-2244						2023	51								9	10.22352/MAGALLANIA202351009	http://dx.doi.org/10.22352/MAGALLANIA202351009													WOS:001109676000006

Cyanobacterial blooms in a warming climate: paleolimnological assessments of three boreal shield lakes in central Ontario, Canada	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Paleolimnological techniques were used to assess long-term water quality changes in three cyanobacterial bloom-impacted lakes in Algoma, Ontario, Canada. Since the 2000s, frequent cyanobacterial blooms have been reported in these lakes despite stable nutrient levels, allowing investigation of recent climate warming as a possible environmental driver of the blooms. While diatom and chironomid community changes varied among the lakes, accelerated warming (<^>1990) led to near-synchronous shifts in paleolimnological indicators, including increased sedimentary chlorophyll a, planktonic diatoms (Discostella stelligera, elongate taxa), and chrysophyte scales. Diatom-inferred total phosphorus and chironomid-inferred hypolimnetic oxygen models indicate oligo-mesotrophic conditions prior to <^>1950, with slightly higher late-summer oxygen concentrations in Desbarats and Bright lakes. Our results suggest a shift towards enhanced thermal stability due to regional warming, supported by instrumental records documenting rising air temperature, reduced wind speed, and a longer ice-free period observed in the last half century. Our paleolimnological inferences indicate that climate-driven changes in fundamental lake physicochemical properties and internal nutrient loading may be contributing to, or even triggering, recent cyanobacterial blooms in these lakes.

U., Jr.			Carbon Dioxide in Taal Volcanic Lake: A Simple Gasometer for Volcano Monitoring	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												We report here an increase in the amount of carbon dioxide in Taal lake during the year preceding the January 2020 eruption. Starting in February 2019, the CO2 emissions from the lake increased from background value (700 t day(-1)) to a flux close to 2,400 t day(-1) at the time of the eruption. We show that the lake acts as a highly sensitive gasometer where CO2 (aq) reflects the balance between CO2 supplied to the lake (by hot springs) and CO2 lost by diffusion at air-water interface. The lake waters are extremely enriched in dissolved carbon dioxide with pCO(2) values as high as 0.35 atm (350,000 ppmV) equivalent to a CO2 (aq) of 9.32 mmol l(-1). The residence time of CO2 in the lake is around 1 week which allows for fast detection of change in magma degassing and makes carbon dioxide a very promising tool for volcano monitoring. Plain Language Summary Volcanic gas fuels volcanic eruptions. Among the dominant species, sulfur dioxide is easily monitored using remote sensing and ground-based instruments. Carbon dioxide remains however challenging to detect and quantify due to its high background in the atmosphere. We have developed a new methodology for monitoring CO2 by using a volcanic lake in an innovative way. It allows to quantify CO2 emissions by the lake, thereby providing critical insights into the change in degassing magma at depth. Using this new methodology, we were able to detect the earlier precursory signs of the January 2020 eruption of Taal volcano in the Philippines which affected over 380,000 people from local communities. The Taal volcanic lake is a unique location to study CO2 emission with spectacular degassing from more than 500 subaqueous vents that were active for many years. The lake waters are extremely enriched in carbon dioxide, to our knowledge, the highest value ever recorded in a lake. Our method also provides the longest time series to date of continuous CO2 emission from a volcano.					; Caudron, Corentin/V-8040-2017	Robic, Julien/0000-0003-3285-437X; Bernard, Alain/0000-0003-2651-7051; Caudron, Corentin/0000-0002-3748-0007													0094-8276	1944-8007				DEC 28	2020	47	24							e2020GL090884	10.1029/2020GL090884	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020GL090884													WOS:000603666000018

In particular, we assessed whether the exchange with the ocean affected the severity of photosynthetic inhibition. During events of marine intrusion, the UV attenuation coefficient (K-d) in the brackish zone decreased up to 70% of the values observed under the influence of the freshwater discharge. The highest inhibition of the PAR-saturated photosynthetic rates by UV radiation (up to 55%) was observed in summer at the brackish zone in association with marine intrusion events. In the freshwater zone, the highest inhibition was up to 3-fold lower than in the brackish area due to higher K-d values in the UV range. On average for the entire system, near-surface primary production was reduced by ca. 25%, and the contribution by UV-A and UV-B was close to 2:1. Our results provide a baseline for future comparisons at a latitude where predicted trends in reduction of stratospheric ozone are significant. However, hydrological changes affecting river discharge and communication frequency with the ocean appear to be more important for the UV underwater climate and primary production than the expected increase in incident UV-B fluxes.

Late quaternary environmental changes in Patagonia as inferred from lacustrine fossil and extant ostracods	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY												In the present study, we compare modern and Quaternary ostracods from two lacustrine basins: Laguna Cari-Laufquen (41 degrees S) and Lago Cardiel (49 degrees S) in Patagonia. Taxonomic and quantitative analyses along with isotopic and chemical studies of the extant ostracod fauna indicate that distinct ostracod associations can be identified as a function of conductivity. Three ostracod associations can be distinguished: (1) springs, ponds and small creeks, characterized by low conductivity (e. g. 1015 ms cm(-1)); (2) lakes and permanent ponds, characterized by medium conductivity (e. g. 1625 ms cm(-1)) and (3) ephemeral lacustrine environments, generally characterized by higher conductivity (e. g. 16 480 ms cm(-1)) These modern ostracod associations were also identified in older sequences from sediments outcropping in the Laguna Cari-Laufquen current shoreline, as well as in sediment cores from Lago Cardiel. The predominance of Limnocythere rionegroensis Cusminsky & Whatley in the Cari-Laufquen sections suggests the development of a saline and turbid lake during the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene, and thus higher precipitation at these latitudes. Changes in ostracod abundance and associations have been observed in Lago Cardiel during the last approximately 16 000 calibrated years BP. Conductivity is known to change as a function of the ratio of precipitation to evaporation and a decrease in conductivity from the Late Pleistocene to the Middle Holocene suggests substantial hydrological variations (i. e. increase of the precipitation/ evaporation ratio suggests minor conductivity). These two examples show that ostracods provide an excellent proxy for interpreting palaeoclimatic and palaeoenvironmental changes in Patagonia.

P.; Centeno, Elena; Lozano, Socorro			Geochemistry of late Quaternary tephra-sediment sequence from north-eastern Basin of Mexico (Mexico): implications to tephrochronology, chemical weathering and provenance	REVISTA MEXICANA DE CIENCIAS GEOLOGICAS												A ca.30 in thick tephra-sediment sequence from the north-eastern Basin of Mexico (Pachuca sub-basin, central Mexico) is investigated for stratigraphy and multi-element geochemistry to understand the tephrochronology, provenance and conditions of chemical weathering during Late Quaternary Chemical compositions of tephra layers are compared with products from surrounding volcanic structures (Apan-Tezontepece; Acoculco, Huichapan, Sierra de las Cruces and Tlaloc) in order to identify their sources. Basalt to basaltic-andesite tephra layers (Tr 1, Tr 6 and Tr 7) show similar composition with rocks from Apan-Tezontepec monogenetic volcanic field aged between 1.50 and 0.47 Ma. Felsic tephra layers have composition comparable to Acoculco volcanic sequence. The dacitic ash (Tr 2) and rhyolitic ash and pumice fall deposits (Tr 3, Tr 4, Tr 5 and Tr 8) might be representatives of different Plinian eruptive events at Acoculco caldera and possibly occurred during <1.50 Ma and >0.24 Ma. Ternary diagrams (A-CN-K, A-C-N and A-CNK-FM) and trace element concentrations suggest that some of the sediment layers are formed from the chemical weathering of the underlying tephra and the rest of the inter-bedded sediments are derived from the erosion of rocks exposed at the Pachuca volcanic range. Indices of chemical weathering such as CIA and PIA indicate varying degrees of chemical alteration for these sediments possibly related to fluctuating humidity and duration of exposure to different weathering agents during their transportation from the hinterland to the sub-basin.					; Jonathan, MP/AAA-4427-2020; P, Dr.Gopinathan/O-2348-2018; Macias, Jose/P-7679-2015; Muthuswamy Ponniah, Jonathan/I-5764-2018	Arce, Jose Luis/0000-0002-6879-6725; Lozano-Garcia, Socorro/0000-0002-3579-175X; Roy, Priyadarsi D./0000-0003-3284-8762; Muthuswamy Ponniah, Jonathan/0000-0001-9040-4911													1026-8774	2007-2902				APR	2012	29	1					24	38																WOS:000302822900002

However, the forcing mechanism of changes in the relative abundance of C3/C4 plants in terrestrial vegetation is unclear due to the lack of comprehensive data sets from the vast study area. Here, the organic carbon isotope (delta C-13(org)) data of mid-latitude modern plants (n = 2833) and topsoil (n = 2017) are compiled, and the linear relationship with the corresponding mean annual temperature (MAT) and precipitation (MAP) is established. Our results demonstrate a close relationship between MAT and the delta C-13(org) values of C3/C4 mixed plants in the soil, implying that temperature is the primary climatic factor determining the relative abundance of C3/C4 plants at mid-latitudes. The results of quantitative reconstruction of paleo-temperature in the Xiaolongwan Lake in Northeast Asia are consistent with the published reconstruction records based on pollen and phytolith, which confirms the reliability of our delta C-13(org)-MAT conversion function. Using the transformation function established in this study, we quantitatively reconstruct the paleo-temperature variation of the Harbin loess in Songnen Plain since the Holocene. The reconstructed MAT shows a continuous increase in the C4 plants abundance with increasing temperature since the mid-Holocene, which is consistent with changes in summer solar insolation at 65 degrees N, oxygen isotopes of cave stalagmite, and phytolith records in the Songnen Plain. Compilation of 715 absolute ages, delta C-13(org) data, regional and global climate records, and human activity intensity records from five dune fields at high risk of desertification from the edge of the East Asian monsoon shows the importance of climate and human activity to the expansion of C4 plants and solidification of dunes.

J	Horton, TW; Oze, C				Horton, Travis W.; Oze, Christopher			Are two elements better than one? Dual isotope-ratio detrending of evaporative effects on lake carbonate paleoelevation proxies	GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS												Stable isotope-based proxy methods enhance our ability to interpret geodynamical histories for tectonic provinces via paleoelevational reconstructions. These methods require that the unmodified isotopic composition of meteoric water is recorded by authigenic minerals, a critical assumption that has not been tested across wide-ranging environmental and topographical contexts. Here, we show that Quaternary lake carbonate delta O-18 values are not strongly, nor significantly, correlated with regional elevation due to the isotopic modification of in-flow waters following entry into the lake environment. These modifications are largely caused by surface water evaporation, and can result in >3 km errors in paleoelevation estimates if not accounted for. However, our analysis suggests that positive shifts in surface water delta O-18 are accompanied by similar magnitude shifts in delta C-13-DIC. This positive co-variation in delta O-18 and delta C-13 may be used to detrend lake carbonate compositions for the effects of surface water evaporation using a parameter we define here as the 'C-13-excess'. When Tibetan lakes are excluded from the data set, C-13-excess values are significantly correlated with mean up-slope hypsometric altitude with an error of +/- 500 m. Application of the C-13-excess approach to Cenozoic lake carbonate records from the western U. S. Cordillera both challenges and reinforces previous paleoelevational interpretations based on delta O-18 alone.

J	Wiley, J; Mercer, A				Wiley, Jake; Mercer, Andrew			Structure and Evolution of Non-Lake-Effect Snow Producing Alberta Clippers	ATMOSPHERE												Alberta Clippers (clippers) have long been associated with lake-effect snow (LES) events due to their frequent passage over the Great Lakes basin. However, not all clippers produce LES, and no research has inquired into which synoptic fields most influence LES formation. This study analyzes clippers during non-LES situations to further knowledge on which atmospheric variables most regulate LES development on the synoptic scale. As no such database currently exists, a clipper repository is developed using National Centers for Environmental Prediction Reanalysis data. The repository is then cross referenced with a previously developed LES repository to identify clippers responsible for LES. Composite synoptic-scale patterns were then constructed on the remaining non-LES clippers to identify synoptic conditions that ultimately inhibited LES formation. This analysis is supplemented by an assessment of lake surface conditions in each composite to evaluate how influential the lake characteristics were in the suppression of LES activity. In total, 51 non-LES clippers were identified, tracked, and separated into three composite map types that exhibited unique storm track and spatial characteristics. Permutation testing revealed that lake surface conditions were not significantly (p & LE; 0.05) different between LES and non-LES associated clippers implying the main LES inhibition factors were meteorological.</p>						Wiley, Jake/0000-0002-7279-7800; Mercer, Andrew/0000-0002-3523-1568														2073-4433				OCT	2021	12	10							1288	10.3390/atmos12101288	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos12101288													WOS:000712268700001

This study examined the influence of snowmelt and rainfall on soil erosion processes and siltation of small lakes in Miyagi Prefecture (150 km northwest of the power plant). Two sets of slopes and lakes, respectively in pasture and forest catchments, were examined. Snowpack thickness, soil infiltration, surface runoff volume, soil and sediment physicochemical properties, Cs concentration of precipitation, meltwater, and rainwater, and lake siltation rates were determined. The total radioactive Cs content in precipitation was 0.7-7.4 Bq.L-1 and was below the Japanese standard (10 Bq.L-1). Total radioactive Cs was at the allowable level in water flowing down the pasture catchment slope (0.1-9.2 Bq.L-1) during snowmelt and rainfall, as well as in pasture (0.9-8.8 Bq.L-1) and forest (0.7-5.2 Bq.L-1) catchment lake water. There was no soil erosion (surface runoff) in the forest catchment. Soil losses in the pasture catchment were 23 due to rainfall and 9 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) following spring snowmelt. After snowmelt, a 0.5 and 0.2 mm thick layer of silt was deposited in pasture and forest catchment lakes, respectively, and 1.4 and 0.6 mm were deposited during the rainfall period. Average siltation rates were 1.9 and 0.8 mm.yr(-1) for pasture and forest catchment lakes, respectively. The upper layer of lake bottom sediments is represented mainly by silt fractions (2-50 mu m), with high organic matter (4.0-5.7%) and radiocesium (1100-1600 kg ha(-1)) contents.

(Hydrocharitaceae) or Brazilian waterweed, is a secondary invader of eutrophic freshwater systems in South Africa, following the successful management of floating aquatic weeds. In 2018, the leaf and stem-mining fly, Hydrellia egeriae Rodrigues-Junior, Mathis & Hauser (Diptera: Ephydridae), was released against E. densa, the first agent released against a submerged aquatic weed in South Africa. During its life stages, the biological control agent is exposed to two environments, air and water. The thermal physiology of both life stages was investigated to optimize agent establishment through fine-tuned release strategies. The thermal physiological limits of H. egeriae encompassed its host plant's optimal temperature range of 10 to 35 degrees C, with lower and upper critical temperatures of 2.6 to 47.0 degrees C, lower and upper lethal temperatures of - 5.6 and 40.6 degrees C for adults, and - 6.3 to 41.3 degrees C for larvae. Results from development time experiments and degree-day accumulation showed that the agent is capable of establishing at all E. densa sites in South Africa, with between 6.9 and 8.3 generations per year. However, cold temperatures (14 degrees C) prolonged the agent's development time to three months, allowing it to only develop through one generation in winter. Predictions obtained from laboratory thermal physiology experiments corroborates field data, where the agent has established at all the sites it was released.

Thus, we evaluated the relationship of environmental factors with the composition and variation of functional groups based on morphology (MBFG) during the hydrological year in an Amazonian floodplain lake, with monthly sampling (2013 to 2014). We used analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Kruskal-Wallis to show differences in physicochemical variables between hydroperiods. We performed permutation analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) to assess the dissimilarity of morphofunctional groups between hydroperiods and also of environmental data between the months of the study and RDA redundancy analysis to assess the relationship between MBFGs and environmental data. It was registered 101 taxa distributed in eight taxonomic categories and was grouped into 5 MBFGs (III, IV, V, VI and VII), with Chlorophyceae (31 taxa) and Cyanobacteria (27 taxas) with the higher number of taxa. Furthermore, there was a dominance of Cyanobacteria in the total biovolume, which form blooms (MBFGs III and VII) during the periods of falling and low water in lake, influenced mainly by the reduction in the availability of light and an increase in temperature. In another scenario, the dominance of MBFGs V and VI occurred during periods of rising and high water with association with carbon compounds, rainfall, SRP and NO2. Thus, our results demonstrate that the availability of light, the concentration of nutrients and temperature were the most important variables for the morphofunctional structuring of phytoplankton in aquatic system.

The contents of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and OM in sediments were determined in four typical lakes in southeastern Hubei, China, in the spring of 2019, and their pollution status was evaluated by organic and comprehensive pollution indexes to identify pollution sources and provide specific directions for the pollution control in key areas of the lakes. We found the following: (1) Both nutrients and OM in Cihu Lake and Bao'an Lake were relatively high. Cihu Lake had the highest nutrient and OM in both surface and core sediments. TN, TP and OM in the surface sediments of Cihu Lake reached 700.9 mg/kg, 1668.8 mg/kg and 62.8 kg/g, respectively. The contents of nutrients and OM in Daye Lake and Liangzi Lake were relatively low. OM in these two lakes was significantly lower than that in the Cihu Lake (p < 0.05). (2) The organic pollution and comprehensive pollution revealed that the pollution level of Cihu Lake and Bao'an Lake was moderate to severe. The level of pollution in Daye Lake and Liangzi Lake was mainly mild and moderate. (3) TN pollution was the main factor affecting sediment pollution in the four lakes compared to TP. The risks associated with N pollution merit increased attention. (4) Correlation analysis showed that there was not always a significant correlation between nutrients and OM in surface sediments (p > 0.05). It indicated that the sources of nutrients and OM in sediments were not identical but were affected by many factors. However, the relationship between nutrients and OM was closer in core sediments. In the future, targeted measures should be taken to reduce sediment pollution based on specific pollution sources and pollution conditions in the four lakes, especially Cihu Lake.

By measuring water level variation, monitoring systems can detect dammed lake events when mudslides block rivers or boost water level. Therefore, an automatic monitoring alarm method based on a hybrid segmentation algorithm is proposed. The algorithm uses the k-means clustering algorithm to segment the picture scene in the RGB color space and the region growing algorithm on the image green channel to select the river target from the segmented scene. The pixel water level variation is used to trigger an alarm for the dammed lake event after the water level has been retrieved. In the Yarlung Tsangpo River basin of the Tibet Autonomous Region of China, the proposed automatic lake monitoring system was installed. We pick up data from April to November 2021, during which the river experienced low, high, and low water levels. Unlike conventional region growing algorithms, the algorithm does not rely on engineering knowledge to pick seed point parameters. Using our method, the accuracy rate is 89.29% and the miss rate is 11.76%, which is 29.12% higher and 17.65% lower than the traditional region growing algorithm, respectively. The monitoring results indicate that the proposed method is a highly adaptable and accurate unmanned dammed lake monitoring system.					; Zhang, Huiling/KHZ-3670-2024; Wang, Xinwei/ABE-2627-2020; wei, yang/A-3635-2010	An, Baosheng/0009-0003-5590-7347; 														1424-8220				MAY 12	2023	23	10							4714	10.3390/s23104714	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s23104714								37430627					WOS:000997577500001

This study examines the climatic drivers of radial growth in Larix sibirica Ledeb in the Kanas Lake region, northern Xinjiang, China, to explore how climate change may alter forest growth patterns. Using tree-ring chronologies, we examine the relationships between temperature, precipitation, and drought conditions, as well as the influence of large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns on growth. Results indicate that high summer temperatures negatively affect tree growth, while adequate precipitation plays a crucial role in mitigating water stress, especially during key growth periods. Positive correlations with the Palmer Drought Severity Index further underscore the importance of long-term moisture availability. Moreover, the study highlights the role of the El Ni & ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation in influencing moisture transport, with significant correlations between sea surface temperatures in the Ni & ntilde;o 4 region and tree-ring growth. Future growth simulations under two climate scenarios suggest that moderate warming (SSP 2-4.5) may enhance growth, while more extreme warming (SSP 5-8.5) introduces greater uncertainty and potential growth instability. These findings provide critical guidance for forest management strategies in the face of climate change.

J	Daly, SF; Barrette, PD				Daly, Steven F.; Barrette, Paul D.			Prevention of Water Intake Blockage by Ice during Supercooling Events	JOURNAL OF COLD REGIONS ENGINEERING												Blockage of water intakes by underwater ice formation during supercooling events is a widespread and common problem in northern regions during winter. In this context, underwater ice formation means deposition of frazil ice and growth of platelet ice. Blockage happens when underwater ice forms on the structural components of the intakes, particularly the intake trash racks, decreasing the area of the intake available for flow. This article evaluates potential solutions for preventing blockage. The solutions are collected into four broad categories: avoidance, prevention, mitigation, and remediation. Avoidance locates the intake so that it is never exposed to supercooled water. Avoidance is not possible in rivers and streams and requires depths in lakes and reservoirs that are not reachable for most intakes. Prevention stops supercooled water from entering the intake. The use of heat to warm the intake flow so that it is not supercooled is the most reliable way of preventing intake blockage by underwater ice. The formation of stable ice covers is a reliable means of preventing blockage events but cannot entirely eliminate them. Mitigation modifies the intake, or its operation, to prevent blockage. Ice adhesion to trash rack bars can be reliably prevented by maintaining the bar surface at a temperature greater than 0 degrees C. Other approaches to mitigation including reducing intake flow, modifying the trash rack design, using coatings or alternative materials, or insulating portions of trash rack bars are not reliable for preventing blockage. Remediation actively removes underwater ice from the intake components while the intake is in operation. Mechanical or manual raking of the intake trash racks to remove deposited frazil ice can be a reliable means of preventing blockage. In addition, a strategy, management, addresses intake operation when practical measures for blockage prevention are not available. Management accommodates periodic blockages into the operation of facilities through detection, damage prevention, and quick and efficient restarts.

Comparison of Multipiscivore Foraging Success on Native and Invasive Prey Fish under Variable Light Intensities	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Piscivorous fishes attack and consume a variety of prey; however, few studies have examined interactions of multiple predators with multiple prey species. The situational complexity of foraging at different times of day was explored by examining the interactions of paired native predators (Burbot Lota lota or Smallmouth Bass Micropterus dolomieu) with either native (Mottled Sculpin Cottus bairdii) or invasive (Round Goby Neogobius melanostomus) benthic prey. The study allowed the comparison of a pursuit predator (Smallmouth Bass) and an ambush predator (Burbot). Trials were performed under natural relevant lighting conditions with downwelling light intensity and emission spectrum matched to the irradiance at a 10-m depth in the St. Louis River estuary during the summer at night, civil twilight, sunrise, and midmorning. Smallmouth Bass were more active and initiated 1,510 reactions that resulted in the successful capture of 61 Round Goby and 103 Mottled Sculpin, whereas Burbot initiated 475 reactions resulting in 24 successful retentions, including 9 Round Goby and 15 Mottled Sculpin. The percentage of successful retentions was greater for Smallmouth Bass (10.9%) than for Burbot (5%). Reaction probabilities to each prey differed significantly, which resulted in a two-fold increase in attacks on Mottled Sculpin compared with Round Goby within the same time period. Reaction distances for both predators did not differ regarding prey species, but Smallmouth Bass reacted from farther away than did Burbot (maximum reaction distances of 159 and 98 cm, respectively). Greater success of native predators on native prey has likely caused higher mortality on native prey populations due to greater predator success, while capturing invasive prey decreases the net energy intake.

Petrophysical characterization of the lacustrine sediment succession drilled in Lake El'gygytgyn, Far East Russian Arctic	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												Seismic profiles of Far East Russian Lake El'gygytgyn, formed by a meteorite impact some 3.6 million years ago, show a stratified sediment succession that can be separated into subunits Ia and Ib at approximately 167 m below lake floor (=similar to 3.17 Ma). The upper (Ia) is well-stratified, while the lower is acoustically more massive and discontinuous. The sediments are intercalated with frequent mass movement deposits mainly in the proximal areas, while the distal region is almost free of such deposits at least in the upper part. In spring 2009, a long core drilled in the lake center within the framework of the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP) penetrated the entire lacustrine sediment succession down to similar to 320 m below lake floor and about 200 m farther into the meteorite-impact-related bedrock. Downhole logging data down to 390 m below lake floor show that the bedrock and the lacustrine part differ significantly in their petrophysical characteristics. The contact between the bedrock and the lacustrine sediments is not abrupt, but rather transitional with a variable mixture of impact-altered bedrock clasts in a lacustrine matrix. Physical and chemical proxies measured on the cores can be used to divide the lacustrine part into five different statistical clusters. These can be plotted in a redox-condition vs. input-type diagram, with total organic carbon content and magnetic susceptibility values indicating anoxic or oxic conditions and with the Si/Ti ratio representing more clastic or more biogenic input.

J	Helminen, H; Sarvala, J; Karjalainen, J				Helminen, H; Sarvala, J; Karjalainen, J			Patterns in vendace recruitment in Lake Pyhajarvi, south-west Finland	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY					Fisheries-Society-of-the-British-Isles Annual Symposium on Ichthyoplankton Ecology	JUL 08-11, 1997	GALWAY, IRELAND	Fisheries Soc Brit Isles				A vendace Coregonus albula population has long formed the basis of a flourishing fishery in Lake Pyhajarvi, south-west Finland. Between 1971 and 1990, it exhibited variations in year-class strength generally characterized by a 2-year cycle of alternating strong and weak year classes, which implied density-dependent regulation probably due to asymmetrical food competition between age groups. The abundance of piscivorous predators in the lake and the warming of water after the hatching of larvae in spring together determined the final year-class strength of vendace. Since 1990, year-class sizes have remained very low and the 2-year cycle has been disrupted. The continuously low levels of recruitment could not be explained by an increased larval mortality, although the decline started with 2 successive years with very high mortality of this life stage which reduced the whole spawning stock to a fraction of earlier levels, and consequently led to low larval numbers such that between 1988 and 1996 larval abundance was positively correlated with the spawning stock size. The importance of the spawning stock size to recruitment could also be seen in the whole 26-year time series as a significant correlation between year-class sizes with a 2-year lag. The observed recruitment patterns of the vendace stock in Lake Pyhajarvi thus show the importance of spawning stock size, intraspecific competition, predator effects and abiotic environmental variation.

The lake is the largest freshwater body in China and a significant congregation site for waterfowl; however, surrounding rice fields and poultry grazing have created an overlap with wild waterbirds, a situation conducive to avian influenza transmission. Reports of HPAI H5N1 in healthy wild ducks at Poyang Lake have raised concerns about the potential of resilient free-ranging birds to disseminate the virus. Yet the role wild ducks play in connecting regions of HPAI H5N1 outbreak in Asia is hindered by a lack of information about their migratory ecology. During 2007-08 we marked wild ducks at Poyang Lake with satellite transmitters to examine the location and timing of spring migration and identify any spatiotemporal relationship with HPAI H5N1 outbreaks. Species included the Eurasian wigeon (Anas penelope), northern pintail (Anas acuta), common teal (Anas crecca), falcated teal (Anas falcata), Baikal teal (Anas formosa), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), gargancy (Anas querquedula), and Chinese spotbill (Anas poecilohyncha). These wild ducks (excluding the resident mallard and Chinese spotbill ducks) followed the East Asian Flyway along the coast to breeding areas in northern China, eastern Mongolia, and eastern Russia. None migrated west toward Qinghai Lake (site of the largest wild bird epizootic), thus failing to demonstrate any migratory connection to the Central Asian Flyway. A newly developed Brownian bridge spatial analysis indicated that HPAI H5N1 outbreaks reported in the flyway were related to latitude and poultry density but not to the core migration corridor or to wetland habitats. Also, we found a temporal mismatch between riming of outbreaks and wild duck movements. These analyses depend on complete or representative reporting of outbreaks, but by documenting movements of wild waterfowl, we present ecological knowledge that better informs epidemiological investigations seeking to explain and predict the spread of avian influenza viruses.					; Muzaffar, Sabir/AAP-7176-2020; Douglas, David/AAU-1087-2021; Xiao, Xiangming/ABS-9360-2022	Xiao, Xiangming/0000-0003-0956-7428; Prosser, Diann/0000-0002-5251-1799; Douglas, David/0000-0003-0186-1104; Muzaffar, Sabir/0000-0001-9195-1677; 													0005-2086	1938-4351				MAR	2010	54	1		S			466	476		10.1637/8914-043009-Reg.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1637/8914-043009-Reg.1								20521681					WOS:000276455300055

This resulted in a notable increase and concentration of the geese population, while the Grus leucogeranus (Siberian Crane) population remained stable but shifted towards artificial habitats. The study examined the interaction between hydrology, mudflats, vegetation, investigating habitat evolution through field studies and model simulations, and improving the Theil index to evaluate the dynamics between overwintering geese populations and habitat changes, using Siberian Crane as a comparative species. The results indicate that: (1) Compared to pre-2003 conditions, the area of sparse grasslands and shallow water bodies in the Duchang Nature Reserve significantly increased before early November. By early November, sparse grasslands in the Duchang Nature Reserve had peaked, increasing by almost 70 km2 compared to the same period before 2003. (2) The Theil index effectively illustrates the supply-demand relationship between goose populations and habitat dynamics. Around 2003, the Theil index for the entire lake fluctuated between 0.05 and 0.25. However, in November before 2003, Duchang's index surged to 0.8 (indicating a low match), attributed to changes in elevation exposure time within the 9-10 m range. Despite shallow water being suitable habitat, plant degradation led to inadequate food, prompting Siberian Crane to forage in nearby artificial habitats. (3) The normalization of drought heightens the risk of habitat supply-demand imbalance in Poyang Lake. By 2035, the conversion of mudflats to sparse grasslands and sparse grasslands to dense grasslands will accelerate. In response to river-lake changes, the optimal subsidence time for the 12 m water level should shift to around October 20, and the 9 m water level should drop in early November. Ensuring food supply in artificial habitats around the lake will become crucial.

A systematic review of the trophic ecology of eight ecologically and culturally important fish species in the North American Arctic	POLAR BIOLOGY												Rapid climate change occurring in the Arctic may affect the diet of ecologically and culturally important northern fish species. Here, a systematic literature review was completed for eight fish species found across the North American Arctic, with a focus on Inuit Nunangat, to identify major prey items, summarize feeding strategies, and highlight data gaps. Arctic Char (Salvelinus alpinus), Dolly Varden Char (Salvelinus malma), Lake Trout (Salvelinus namaycush), Bull Trout (Salvelinus confluentus), Inconnu (Stenodus leucichthys), Lake Whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis), Broad Whitefish (Coregonus nasus), and Burbot (Lota lota), were selected as species of interest due to their ecological and cultural importance. The 74 studies reviewed indicate that these species are generalist feeders that demonstrate wide dietary niches, as well as the tendency to avoid agonistic interactions by partitioning resources when they co-occur with an overlapping species. Across coastal, lacustrine, and riverine systems, the most commonly consumed prey items are insects (Diptera spp.), as well as benthic forage fishes such as sculpins (Family: Cottidae). Insects are major prey items in riverine systems, where diets appear to be more generalized, compared to lakes. Anadromous species in coastal waters most commonly feed on various crustaceans and forage fishes. Benthic forage fishes, insects, zooplankton, and mollusks are widely consumed prey items in Arctic lakes. Burbot, Inconnu, and resident Dolly Varden had the most specialized feeding strategies, due in part to their habitat requirements and morphology, while Lake Trout and resident Arctic Char often form multiple ecotypes in lakes, some with different feeding behaviors. Knowledge gaps regarding northern fish trophic ecology are highlighted, and in particular include riverine systems and winter foraging behavior. This review is intended to inform predictions regarding the impacts of climate change on fish tropic ecology and to guide future research.																			0722-4060	1432-2056				MAY	2023	46	5					409	425		10.1007/s00300-023-03133-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00300-023-03133-9		APR 2023											WOS:000975982700001

We present here a systematic and taphonomic study of the molluscs found in the carbonate deposits in the Serra da Bodoquena and the limestones lenses of the Pantanal do Miranda, which provide information concerning the carbonate palaeoenvironments of these two distinct areas. Seven molluscan species were found: the gastropods Marisa sp., Pomacea canaliculata, an unidentified hydrobiid, Idiopyrgus sp., Biomphalaria sp. and Megalobulimus sp., and the bivalve Pisidium sp. The gastropods include species still living in the area today, which supports a Holocene age for the limestones, as indicated by published C-14 dates. Overall, the data obtained from the Serra da Bodoquena carbonates suggest a freshwater environment with minimal current-wave action, in an area probably fed by springs, close to a terrestrial environment, in view of the assemblage composed of Pomacea canaliculata, the unidentified hydrobiid, Idiopyrgus sp., Biomphalaria sp. and Megalobulimus sp. The lacustrine palaeoenvironment in the Pantanal do Miranda area was different, as indicated by the presence of Marisa sp. and absence of shallow-water species such as Biomphalaria sp. The gastropods from Serra da Bodoquena and Pantanal do Miranda are predominantly aquatic and amphibious; they are probably younger than the terrestrial gastropods reported from fine-grained limestones in the Corumba area.

This study analysed remote sensing data and long term climate variables to examine the hydrological response of lakes in Nam Co Basin. The area changes of lakes were extracted by Landsat TM/ETM+ and analysed by SRTM 3 DEM. And the ICESat elevation data between 2003 and 2009 were used to observe the lake level of the Nam Co Lake. The results show that the number of new formed glacier lakes increased by 36% and the area of glacier lakes increased by 36.7% (0.97 km(2)) from 1991 to 2011. At the same time, the surface area of the Nam Co Lake expanded by 3.71% (72.64 km(2)) of the original size in 1991, with a tendency value of 3.63 km(2) per year. The lake level of the Nam Co Lake shows an increase tendency of 0.24 m per year during 2003-2009. These variations appear to be related to an increase in mean annual temperature of 0.06 A(0)C per year, and an increase in annual precipitation of 2.1 mm per year in summer in the last two decades. The increased number of lakes and increased area of glacial lakes reached a peak at an altitude of 5 500-5 600 m a.s.l.. The number of new formed glacier lakes and the area of glacier lakes tend to higher altitudes. Climate change has an important impact on the variation of the glacier lakes and the Nam Co Lake.

J	Yihdego, Y; Paffard, A				Yihdego, Yohannes; Paffard, Andrew			Hydro-engineering solution for a sustainable groundwater management at a cross border region: case of Lake Nyasa/Malawi basin, Tanzania	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-ENGINEERING												A groundwater resources assessment has been carried out for the Lake Nyasa Basin east Africa, with reference to sub catchments further to the whole basin wise analysis, including quantification of potential yields from the aquifers. Numerical groundwater models, MODFLOW-SURFACT coupled with Visual MODFLOW, were used to assess sub-basin groundwater sustainability (Via "Zone Budget" software package). The model has been calibrated to observed hydraulic head and processed baseflow estimate. It is concluded that the aquifer system is sustained by episodic recharge and the long-term gaining storage which represents the maximum extractable volume. Future predictions of groundwater usage indicate that by 2035 the percentage of annual safe yield extracted will increase to between 11.3 and 103%. Model result suggests that there is a need to revise the current estimate of sustainable yield based on future climate change conditions and projected population growth, which would decrease spring flows substantially and decrease hydraulic head basin-wide. It also suggests that by 2035 some sub catchments will be nearly at or exceeding the annual safe yield leaving no room for socio-economic development, or the need to reduce existing socio-economic demands to meet domestic demands. Besides to improving the natural replenishment capacity through artificial recharge technique, the other option is to increase the percentage of total recharge allocated to the annual safe yield from 10% of the total annual recharge to 20% in these catchments. This provides a basis for management of individual groundwater scheme in sustaining livelihood activities or implications of policies and to develop a plan for potential groundwater extraction scenarios pertaining to water use and allocation.

Dissolved free amino acids and carbohydrates comprised the main fraction in the labile organic carbon pool. Dissolved free amino acids in marine waters varied between 3-1400 nM and those of freshwaters between 2.6-4124 nM. Dissolved free carbohydrates varied between 0.4-5000 nM in marine systems and between 14-1111 nM in freshwaters. The turnover times of both substrate pools varied in marine waters between 1.4 hours and 948 days and in freshwaters between 2 hours and 51 days. Measurements of stable C-12/13-ratio and C-14-isotope dating in ocean deep water samples revealed DOC turnover times between 2000-6000 years. Studies on carbon flows within the aquatic food webs revealed that about 50% of photosynthetically fixed carbon was channelled via DOC to the bacterioplankton. Excreted organic carbon varied between 1-70% of photosynthetically fixed carbon in marine waters and between 1-99% in freshwaters. The labile organic carbon pool represented only 10-30% of the DOC. The majority (70-90%) of the DOC was recalcitrant to microbial assimilation. Only 10-20% of the DOC could be easily chemically identified. Most of the large bulk material represented dissolved humic matter and neither the chemical structure nor the ecological function of the DOC is as yet clearly understood.																			0003-6072	1572-9699					1993	63	3-4					243	274		10.1007/BF00871222	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00871222								8279823					WOS:A1993ME38500005

The end Triassic mass extinction record of Williston Lake, British Columbia	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Triassic-Jurassic boundary sections on the shore of Lake Williston, British Columbia record a spectrum of depositional environments from the western Canadian continental margin. A primarily deep-water, anoxic record of deposition, indicated by V/V+Ni, V/Cr, Th/U indices and pyrite framboid and facies data, is seen throughout the Late Triassic-Early Jurassic (Norian-Hettangian) interval in a section at Black Bear Ridge. Abundant Monotis bivalve populations in Norian strata are interpreted to have lived on the seabed during transient oxygenation events that punctuated the background anoxic conditions. Monotis went extinct around the Norian/Rhaetian boundary and the deep-water assemblages are subsequently dominated by thin-shelled pectinids. An intra-Rhaetian sea-level fall generated a major hiatus in the proximal Black Bear Ridge section whilst distinctive lowstand strata were developed in the more distal and more complete Ne Parle Pas Point and Pardonet Creek sections. These consist of shallow-water, phosphatic ooid sand facies that contain diverse bivalves. The majority of the infaunal bivalves (but not the epifaunal ones) disappeared at the acme of the regression. This is the end-Triassic mass extinction event and it occurred shortly before a terminal Triassic flooding event. This transgressive event is associated with a rapid negative shift of delta C-13(org) values interpreted to be the Initial Isotope Excursion of Hesselbo et al. [Hesselbo, S.P., Robinson, S.A., Surlyk, F., Piasecki, S., 2002. Terrestrial and marine extinction at the Triassic-Jurassic boundary synchronized with major carbon-cycle perturbation: a link to initiation of massive volcanism? Geology 30, 251-254]. The Rhaetian record of Williston Lake thus records an extinction of shallow-water infaunal bivalves during a lowstand prior to the development of a transgressive record that is associated with a major, negative C isotope.

The three investigated reaches were (i) a channel over a barrier with low gradient; (ii) flow through a deep lake; and (iii) a channel with cascades and a steep gradient. The aim of the study was to establish the influence of physiographical and hydrological differences of these reaches on the quality and quantity of seston transport and food resources in the seston. To calculate the seston transport, we measured: total suspended matter (TSM), particulate inorganic matter (PIM), particulate organic matter (POM), chlorophyll-a (chl-a), heterotrophic bacteria and discharge. The PIM contribution from TSM ranged between 60 and 90%, while the percentage of POM in TSM was the highest in summer and ranged from 33 to 46%. POM and discharge were significantly negatively correlated (r = -0.43, P < 0.05). For the transport of TSM, PIM, POM and chlorophyll-a statistically significant differences between the three reaches were established. In a principal component analysis, 86% of the variance was explained by the first two factors. The first factor corresponded well with net transport of TSM, PIM, POM and chl-a and distinguished investigated reaches in two groups: the 1(st) group with increasing (reaches with low gradient and with high gradient), and the 2nd group with decreasing net seston transport (reach with flow through a deep lake). The second factor corresponded strongly with discharge and distinguished investigated reaches according to their temporal variability.					; Spoljar, Maria/AAZ-8174-2020	Spoljar, Maria/0000-0003-1006-8300; 													0018-8158					MAR	2007	579						199	209		10.1007/s10750-006-0409-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-006-0409-4													WOS:000244187200016

Movement Ecology of a Potamodromous Top Predator in a Large Lake: Synchrony and Coexistence of Distinct Migratory Patterns	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Migrations are a critical component of the life histories of many highly mobile animals. Potamodromous migrations that occur within large lakes are poorly understood for most species. This lack of understanding hampers restoration efforts and adaptive management because the movement of species and underlying patterns and mechanisms help scientists identify important habitats and quantify species' roles in the ecosystem. This study quantified the spatiotemporal movements and migratory patterns of Lake Trout Salvelinus namaycush, an iteroparous, potamodromous predator, in eastern Lake Ontario. The lake is highly managed and supports a diverse fish community of native and nonnative species. The movements of 41 Lake Trout were quantified over 2.4 years (December 2016 to April 2019) across a large array of 196 acoustic receivers in eastern Lake Ontario. An analysis of individual movements revealed a potential annual convergence occurring in the fall at a location other than the spawning grounds, followed by a synchronized migration to spawning areas. Consistent with divergent migrations, return migration was asynchronous among individuals but consistent in timing interannually, stretching over a longer period than did prespawning movements and across multiple routes. The data suggest the existence of three groups (i.e., contingents) of Lake Trout with distinct migratory behaviors. This study provides important information on the migratory patterns and routes and a potential staging area for a potamodromous top predator population in a large lake. This information can help managers understand the potential success and implications of employing different rehabilitation strategies, such as diversifying populations of Lake Trout through selective strain stocking in large deep lakes to aid reestablishment across habitats. In addition, our results have the potential to improve community dynamics modeling, understanding of nutrient cycling, and overall ecosystem function of large lakes.

Anthropogenic and climate controls on vegetation changes between 1500 BCE and 500 CE reconstructed from a high-resolution pollen record from varved sediments of Lake Mondsee, Austria	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												This study reports a precisely dated pollen record with a 20-year resolution from the varved sediments of Lake Mondsee in the north-eastern European Alps (47 degrees 49'N, 13 degrees 24'E, 481 m above sea level). The analysed part of core spans the interval between 1500 BCE and 500 CE and allows changes in vegetation composition in relation to climatic changes and human activities in the catchment to be inferred. Intervals of distinct but modest human impact are identified at ca. 1450-1220, 740-490 and 340-190 BCE and from 80 BCE to 180 CE. While the first two intervals are synchronous with prominent salt mining phases during the Bronze Age and Early Iron Age at the nearby UNESCO World Heritage Site of Hallstatt, the last two intervals fall within the Late Iron Age and Roman Imperial Era, respectively. Comparison with published records of extreme runoff events obtained from the same sediment core shows that human activities (including agriculture and logging) around Lake Mondsee were low during intervals of high flood frequency as indicated by a higher number of intercalated detrital event layers, but intensified during hydrologically stable intervals. Comparison of the pollen percentages of arboreal taxa with the stable oxygen isotope and potassium ion records of the NGRIP and GISP2 ice cores from Greenland reveals significant positive correlations for Fagus and negative correlations for Betula and Alnus. This underlines the sensitivity of vegetation around Lake Mondsee to temperature fluctuations in the North Atlantic as well as to moisture fluctuations controlled by changes in the intensity of the Siberian High and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) regime.					; Tarasov, Pavel/ABG-3993-2020	Brauer, Achim/0000-0002-6655-9451; Lauterbach, Stefan/0000-0003-4131-0366; 													0031-0182	1872-616X				DEC 1	2020	559								109976	10.1016/j.palaeo.2020.109976	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2020.109976													WOS:000591242700016

Spatiotemporal changes in sedimentary chironomid assemblages across a gradient of lake water pH and metal contamination from the Sudbury (Ontario, Canada) metal-smelting region	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Base metal smelting in Sudbury (Ontario, Canada) resulted in marked environmental degradation starting in the late nineteenth century. The environmental legacy of intensive industrial activity remains evident in the region despite remediation efforts and recovery. Even though chironomids (Diptera: Chironomidae) are important trophic intermediates, relatively little is known about their response to base metal smelting contaminants. We examined the spatial distribution of recently deposited (i.e., modern) chironomid assemblages in 64 lakes, which we found was most related to lake depth. Further, we compared pre-1880 assemblages to recent sedimentary assemblages with a 32-lake subset. The influence of past contamination was apparent from the replacement of acid- and metal-sensitive taxa with tolerant taxa and early colonizers. In clear lakes, littoral taxa experienced the most change. Chironomid diversity appears lower in recent sediments compared to pre-impact sediments, which is in part related to the persistence of tolerant communities and the lack of recovery of acid-/metal-sensitive taxa, but may also be related to changes in biotic stressors. Spatial trends in chironomid assemblages can inform modern studies of biodiversity recovery in metal smelting regions and strengthen future inferences of how smelting emissions have influenced fish communities and deep-water habitat in the context of multiple modern stressors.

Linking zebra mussel growth and survival with two cellular stress indicators during chronic temperature stress	INVERTEBRATE BIOLOGY												Sessile aquatic invertebrates are at great risk for temperature stress. Changes in ambient temperature affect metabolic demands, thus altering energy budgets, and often reducing performance or survival of these species. Zebra mussels are highly invasive, yet little is known about their physiology under biologically relevant conditions, especially with regard to cellular parameters. This study examined the effect of temperature on zebra mussel physiology and investigated whether the levels of two cellular markers, HSP70 and AMPK activity, could serve as indicators of chronic thermal stress. Mussels were collected from a site in central Illinois, slowly acclimated to either 10, 20, or 30 degrees C, and held at these temperatures for four weeks. Size, mortality, and the cellular markers were measured. Size and mortality data indicate heat stress at 30 degrees C. Elevation in HSP70 levels confirmed this temperature elicits a stress response. Elevation in AMPK activity was not detected at 30 degrees C, most likely indicating this temperature is beyond the scope for this marker, and therefore at or near the lethal limit. These data suggest this zebra mussel population experiences reduced performance and potential mortality in the field during summer months. Interestingly, cold acclimation resulted in a temporary elevation in AMPK activity, a result that has not been reported previously in ectotherms and is likely attributable to the metabolic demands of thermal acclimation.																			1077-8306	1744-7410				SEP	2015	134	3					189	202		10.1111/ivb.12089	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ivb.12089													WOS:000360581600002
J	Fait, P; Demierre, E; Ilg, C; Oertli, B				Fait, Pauline; Demierre, Eliane; Ilg, Christiane; Oertli, Beat			Small mountain reservoirs in the Alps: New habitats for alpine freshwater biodiversity?	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												Today, aquatic biodiversity suffers from many pressures linked to human activities, including climate change, which particularly affects alpine areas. Many alpine freshwater species have shifted their geographical distribution to colder areas, but a reduced availability of suitable habitats is also forecasted. New artificial water bodies could provide habitat enhancement opportunities, including small mountain reservoirs built to overcome a lack of snow during winter. To investigate the role of reservoirs as a habitat for freshwater invertebrates, a case study was conducted on eight reservoirs in the Swiss Alps. The study aimed to compare the water quality and freshwater biodiversity of the reservoirs with those of 39 natural and newly excavated ponds. Data were collected on physico-chemistry, freshwater habitat structure, and aquatic insects (dragonflies and aquatic beetles). The study showed that the mountain reservoirs investigated did not differ from natural ponds in terms of surface area, conductivity, and trophic level. Similarly to natural ponds, reservoirs showed signs of impairment owing to surface run-off carrying pollutants linked to ski tourism. They presented a low diversity of mesohabitats, and in particular lacked vegetation. Compared with natural ponds, the species richness in reservoirs was lower for dragonflies but not for beetles. At the regional scale, the community from the reservoirs was a subset of the natural ponds community, supporting 38% of the regional species richness for these two insect groups. The results suggest that mountain reservoirs are likely to be important for biodiversity in alpine areas, both as habitats and as stepping stones for species shifting their geographical range. These water bodies can be enhanced further by some nature-friendly measures to maximize benefits for biodiversity, including margin revegetation or the creation of adjacent ponds. Ecological engineering needs to be innovative and promote freshwater biodiversity in artificial reservoirs.

The island offers extensively managed woodlands, highly structured open landscapes and a broad reed belt around the shore. On average the flight activity of the 6 radio tracked females outside the roost lasted 229 min per night. The home range size varied between 6.8 and 62.7 ha (mean 25.2 ha). The size of the activity centres varied between 2.8 and 8.2 ha (mean 5.3) and all except one were located almost exclusively in woodland. Within woodlands the bats did not select for specific spatial structures (different age classes of the stands or canopy densities). Only two bats regularly foraged in additional habitats outside woodlands. One of these bats used orchards and tree rows; the other foraged over artificial ponds and gardens adjoining to its woodland foraging area. We never found the bats foraging over the lake or the reed belt. Longer linear landscape elements as tree lines were used during commuting flights but there was no indication of a continuous foraging activity along these elements. Two females left the island to forage on the mainland in August after the fledging of juveniles. To reach the mainland shore, the bats had to fly at least 1.2 km across the lake. Assuming that most foraging flights on the island occur in woodlands, a bat density in this habitat type of 0.7 bats/ ha can be calculated.

J	Gyori, E				Gyori, E			December 2002: 19-year old male with febrile illness after jet ski accident - Diagnosis - Primary amebic meningoencephalitis (Naegleria Fowleri).	BRAIN PATHOLOGY												The December 2002 COM. A 19-year-old healthy male fell into stagnant water of the intercostal waterway (salt water of South Florida), following a jet ski accident. He sustained minor superficial injuries but engulfed significant quantities of water and sediment. A few days later he developed bifrontal headaches, vomiting, a stiff neck and a temperature of 102degreesF. A CT scan on admission without contrast was negative. The CSF had markedly elevated white count but bacterial and fungal cultures were negative. He became progressively lethargic. On the fifth day he developed seizure activity. He expired the next day despite antibiotics. Gross examination of the brain at autopsy revealed edema, cerebellar tonsillar herniation and purulent meningitis. Microscopic examination revealed a massive leptomeningeal inflammatory infiltrate composed of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and numerous histiocyte-like cells. The inflammatory infiltrate extended into the cerebral parenchyma in numerous areas also involving the cerebellum, brainstem and ventricular system. Given the exposure to stagnant water (later confirmed to be a man-made fresh water lake), and the numerous histiocytic-like cells, suspicion for an amebic etiology of the disease process was raised and the CDC identified the ameba as Naegleria Fowleri. Infection by Naegleria Fowleri, a free-living ameba, occurs after exposure to polluted water in man-made fresh water lakes, ponds, swimming pools, particularly during the warm weather months when the thermophilic ameba grows well. The pathologic substrate of the infection is an acute hemorrhagic, necrotizing meningo-encephalitis mainly at the base of the brain, brainstem and cerebellum occurring in young, healthy individuals.																			1015-6305					APR	2003	13	2					237	+											12744479					WOS:000186613800015
J	Persoiu, A; Badaluta, CA; Lee, J				Persoiu, Aurel; Badaluta, Carmen-Andreea; Lee, Jeonghoon			Stable isotope hydrology of surface and ground waters in King George Island, Antarctica	ISOTOPES IN ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH STUDIES												The region around the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula is warming fast, a situation that will lead to widespread changes in local hydrological cycles. King George Island (KGI) hosts a complex network of lakes and rivers, fed by glaciers, snow and rain, and underlain by thick permafrost. We present here the first study of the stable isotope composition of the surface waters in the ice-free southern peninsulas of KGI. Permafrost samples had the highest delta 18O and delta 2H values (-6.7 and -50 parts per thousand, respectively), and river waters the lowest (-9.1 and -70 parts per thousand, respectively), with groundwater (-8.2 and -62.7 parts per thousand, respectively), lakes (-8.6 and -66.8 parts per thousand, respectively) and (summer) meltwater (-9 and -69.5 parts per thousand, respectively) having intermediary values. Our results suggest that a clear separation of the various water bodies (permafrost, snow, meltwater, lakes) based on the delta 18Owater and delta 2Hwater is possible. Further, water in lakes on a W-E transect (i.e. with increased distance from the Bellingshausen Sea) have a general tendency towards lower delta 18O (and delta 2H) values. The results allow for the establishment of a baseline against which ongoing and future changes of the hydrological cycle could be analysed, and past climate changes be reconstructed.

J	Bahr, HM				Bahr, Howard M.			Finding oneself among the saints: Thomas F. O'Dea, Mormon intellectuals, and the future of Mormon orthodoxy	JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION												Thomas F. O'Dea's classic The Mormons identified "Mormonism's encounter with modern secular thought" as perhaps the church's greatest problem. In line with secularization theory, O'Dea predicted an attenuation of traditional Mormonism, and an adaptation and gradual liberalization of Mormon theology as the literal interpretation of Mormon origins "dissolved" in the solvent of modernity. O'Dea's views on the crisis facing Mormonism were based, in part, on ethnographic field work in Salt Lake City in the summer of 1950, as interpreted by a modernist Catholic sociologist. A review of his field notes suggests that key informants who "hosted" much of O'Dea's research activity were liberal Mormon academics who defined the church's traditional theology as a problem. This viewpoint agreed with O'Dea's preconceptions about the "education and apostasy" dilemma. A comparison of O'Deas published "reading" of his field notes with the notes themselves suggests the plausibility of alternative readings. One such alternative is offered here, an interpretation of the interplay of education, Mormon theology, and Mormon intellectualism drawn from O'Dea's field notes, but with a different emphasis from that of his essay. Finally, reverting to a modernist perspective, I offer some hints from survey research suggesting that the predicted liberalization of Mormon theology has yet to occur.																			0021-8294	1468-5906				SEP	2008	47	3					463	484		10.1111/j.1468-5906.2008.00421.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-5906.2008.00421.x													WOS:000259192900009
J	Loope, WL; Fisher, TG; Jol, HM; Goble, RJ; Anderton, JB; Blewett, WL				Loope, WL; Fisher, TG; Jol, HM; Goble, RJ; Anderton, JB; Blewett, WL			A Holocene history of dune-mediated landscape change along the southeastern shore of Lake Superior	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Causal links that connect Holocene high stands of Lake Superior with dune building, stream damming and diversion and reservoir impoundment and infilling are inferred from a multidisciplinary investigation of a small watershed along the SE shore of Lake Superior. Radiocarbon ages of wood fragments from in-place stumps and soil O horizons, recovered from the bottom of 300-ha Grand Sable Lake, suggest that the near-shore inland lake was formed during multiple episodes of late Holocene dune damming of ancestral Sable Creek. Forest drownings at similar to3000, 1530, and 300 cal. years BP are highly correlated with local soil burial events that occurred during high stands of Lake Superior. During these and earlier events, Sable Creek was diverted onto eastward-graded late Pleistocene meltwater terraces. Ground penetrating radar (GPR) reveals the early Holocene valley of Sable Creek (now filled) and its constituent sedimentary structures. Near-planar paleosols, identified with GPR, suggest two repeating modes of landscape evolution mediated by levels of Lake Superior. High lake stands drove stream damming, reservoir impoundment, and eolian infilling of impoundments. Falling Lake Superior levels brought decreased sand supply to dune dams and lowered stream base level. These latter factors promoted stream piracy, breaching of dune dams, and aerial exposure and forestation of infilled lakebeds. The bathymetry of Grand Sable Lake suggests that its shoreline configuration and depth varied in response to events of dune damming and subsequent dam breaching. The interrelated late Holocene events apparent in this study area suggest that variations in lake level have imposed complex hydrologic and geomorphic signatures on upper Great Lakes coasts.

These studies were performed during summer 1990 (pre-treatment condition) and 1991 (post-treatment condition). The pH of the water coming from the hydraulic vents was on average 0.2-0.4 units lower than the pH of the lake water on the acid treated side of the lake. This difference was less on the control side. The DOC concentration was higher in the discharged water (12-31 mg/L) than in the lake water (5-10 mg/L), the vents on the acidified side having concentrations about two times the vents on the control side. Octanol soluble carbon increased on average from 46-104 mug/L in the vents on the acid treated side of the lake after the first year of acid treatment, and was significantly higher than in the lake itself. There was no significant difference in OSC between lake water, nonvents, and the vents on the control side of the lake, nor was there any significant difference between 90 and 91 at these locations. The OSC fraction of the total DOC pool was higher in the lake (0.58%) than in the vents (0.24%).																			0160-4120						1992	18	6					631	636		10.1016/0160-4120(92)90030-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0160-4120(92)90030-8													WOS:A1992KA01900011

According to the Bulgarian legislation, the ecological classification of lakes and reservoirs is based mainly on physical parameters and on two biological quality elements, and namely phytoplankton and macrophytes. The other three widely used biological quality elements, macrozoobenthos, fish and zooplankton communities, are not adopted yet. An integrated method designed for the ecological assessment of shallow lakes called ECOFRAME approach was tested. This system had been developed for the implementation of the Water Framework Directive and included the application of other biotic variables. Our investigation was conducted in the summer of 2012. Most of the samples were collected and processed as described in the ECOFRAME methodology, or by the state-of-the-art methods. According to the analysed biotic variables, only the Srebarna Lake was assessed as a lake with Moderate ecological quality, while the other three sites were assessed as with Poor ecological quality. The ecological assessment based on abiotc variables determined Poor ecological quality for all of the studied lakes and it was accepted as being the final assessment of the ecological status. The results obtained suggest that the ECOFRAME method for ecological assessment needs further verification for the specific conditions in the shallow oxbow lakes on the Lower Danube River floodplain.

J	Kraemer, TF				Kraemer, TF			Radium isotopes in Cayuga Lake, New York: Indicators of inflow and mixing processes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Naturally occurring radium isotopes ( Ra-223, Ra-224, (226) Ra, and Ra-228) were measured in lake and tributary water of Cayuga Lake, New York, during the course of a vernal inflow event in the spring of 2001. A large influx of groundwater, probably from a carbonate aquifer, entered the lake at its extreme southern end early in the vernal inflow event and spread northward, covering an extensive part of the southern end of the lake. The low Ra-228/Ra-226 activity ratio of this water mass, compared with bulk lake water, allowed its identification through time. Estimates of mixing with bulk lake water were calculated from changes in the Ra-226 content. Groundwater inflow to the lake around the delta of a major tributary was detected on the basis of Ra-223 and Ra-224 activity of lake and tributary water. Inflow of a water mass to the surface of the take was also detected using Ra-223 and Ra-224 activity. The integrity of this water mass was monitored using short-lived radium isotopes. Suspended sediment in the lake water is a source of the short-lived radium isotopes Ra-223 (similar to2 X 10(-4) dpm L-1) and Ra-224 (similar to3 X 10(-3) dpm L-1), but bottom sediments are a more significant source of Ra-228. Radium isotopes can be valuable new tools in limnological investigations, allowing detection and monitoring of events and processes such as water inflow and mixing, determining sources of inflowing water, and monitoring introduced water masses as they move within the lake.																			0024-3590					JAN	2005	50	1					158	168		10.4319/lo.2005.50.1.0158	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2005.50.1.0158													WOS:000226406800015
J	Meixner, T; Bales, RC; Williams, MW; Campbell, DH; Baron, JS				Meixner, T; Bales, RC; Williams, MW; Campbell, DH; Baron, JS			Stream chemistry modeling of two watersheds in the Front Range, Colorado	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												We investigated the hydrologic, geochemical, and biogeochemical controls on stream chemical composition on the Green Lakes Valley and Andrews Creek watersheds using the alpine hydrochemical model (AHM). Both sites had comparable data sets from 1994 and 1996, including high-resolution spatial data and high-frequency time series of hydrology, geochemistry, and meteorology. The model of each watershed consisted of three terrestrial subunits (soil, talus, and rock), with the routing between the subunits determined by spatial land cover data. Using 1994 data for model calibration and 1996 data for evaluation AHM captured the dominant processes and successfully simulated daily stream chemical composition on both watersheds. These results confirm our procedure of using spatial and site-specific field and laboratory data to generate an initial catchment model and then calibrating the model to calculate effective parameters for unmeasured processes. A net source of nitrogen was identified in the Andrews Creek watershed during the spring snowmelt period, whereas nitrogen was immobilized in the Green Lakes Valley. This difference was most likely due to the larger and more dominant area of talus in the Andrews Creek watershed. Our results also indicate that routing of snowmelt through either soil or talus material is sufficient for retention of H+ and release of base cations but that N retention is more important on areas mapped as soil. Owing to the larger ionic pulse and larger fraction of surface runoff the Green Lakes Valley was more sensitive to a doubling of wet deposition chemistry than the Andrews Creek watershed.

J	Lewis, J; Coats, R				Lewis, Jack; Coats, Robert			Trends in Raindrop Kinetic Energy with Modeled Climate Warming in the Lake Tahoe Basin	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Two means by which climate change may increase surface soil erosion in mountainous terrain are: (1) increasing the frequency of extreme rainfall events and (2) decreasing the duration of snow cover on bare soil. We used output from four general circulation models (GCMs) and two greenhouse gas trajectories to produce a suite of hydrologic variables at a daily time-step for historic and projected 21st Century conditions. We statistically disaggregated the daily rainfall to hourly, using hourly rainfall from a network of nine weather stations in the Tahoe Basin, and filtered out rain falling on a snowpack. We applied published equations to convert hourly intensity to raindrop kinetic energy (KE) for each day and grid cell in the Basin, averaged across grid cells, and created time series of total annual and maximum annual hourly kinetic energy (TKE and MKE) on snow-free ground. Using the Generalized Extreme Value distribution, we calculated the significance of long-term trends in KE on snow-free ground, and estimated energy levels for return periods of 2, 20, and 100 years. We then detrended the snowpack data and compared the resulting trends in KE with the trends resulting from changes in both rainfall energy and snowpack under two GCMs. Principal findings include (1) upward trends in MKE, (2) stronger upward trends in TKE; and (3) an effect of increasing rainfall intensities on KE in some cases, and a strong effect of reduced snowpack in all cases examined.																			1093-474X	1752-1688				JUN	2020	56	3					472	485		10.1111/1752-1688.12834	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1752-1688.12834													WOS:000539918600008

The Dahu and Daping Swamps are located in the eastern and western parts of the Nanling Mountains in South China, respectively. They are asynchronous variations of Hg deposition reflected by the two swamps since the last deglaciation. Based on the comprehensive comparative analysis of physical, chemical, and biological proxies, it is indicated that Hg deposition changes in the Dahu and Daping mainly record the changes in Hg content in the catchment input from organic matter. The differences in organic matter sources, core surrounding environment, Hg sources and atmospheric sedimentation contribution are reasons associated with the catchment environment for the observed differences in swamp Hg deposition and the response to climate. In cold/dry periods, Hg adsorption by terrestrial organic matter in Dahu Swamp were more significant, while in warm/humid periods, Hg adsorption by endogenous organic matter in Daping Swamp and wet deposition of nearby Hg sources, were the main climate-related processes for their asynchronous response. In addition, Dahu and Daping Swamps show similarities and differences in their Hg deposition variations. In both swamps, multi-millennial (similar to 1000-2200yr) and multi-centennial cycles (similar to 300-500yr) were observed and may be related to the harmonic period of the Earth's precession cycle and the solar activity cycle. This study helps to understand the differences in response between sedimentary Hg and climate, and to understand the regional and global proxies used to record climate and environmental changes.					; WANG, Xiao-Jun/L-7196-2018; Zhang, Chunxia/B-3713-2015	Wang, Xiaojun/0000-0002-4572-3742; quan, mingying/0000-0003-3972-0841; 													0277-3791	1873-457X				FEB 1	2024	325								108490	10.1016/j.quascirev.2023.108490	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2023.108490		DEC 2023											WOS:001151774600001

Cells of strain LBB1 were motile and spherical to rod-shaped, suggesting a relationship to Rhodobacter or Rhodovulum species, and the organism was capable of both phototrophic and chemotrophic growth on a wide variety of organic compounds. Phototrophically grown cultures were yellow to yellow-brown in color and grew optimally at pH 9 (pH range 7.5-10) and 1% NaCl (range 0-10%). In physiological studies of strain LBB1, neither photoautotrophy (H-2- Or sulfide-dependent) nor nitrogen fixation was observed. Absorption spectra revealed that all three strains contained bacteriochlorophyll a and carotenoids of the spheroidene pathway and synthesized only a light-harvesting (LH) I-type photosynthetic antenna complex. Electron microscopy of cells of strain LBB1 revealed a vesicular intracytoplasmic membrane system, although only a few vesicles were observed per cell. The G+C content of strain LBB1 DNA was 59 mol%. significantly lower than that of known Rhodobacter and Rhodovulum species, and its phylogeny as determined by ribosomal RNA gene sequencing placed it within the Rhodobacter/Rhodovulum clade yet distinct from all described species of either of these genera. The unique assemblage of properties observed in strain LBB1 warrants its inclusion in a new genus of purple nonsulfur bacteria and the name Rhodobaca bogoriensis is proposed herein, the genus name reflecting morphological characteristics and the species epithet referring to the habitat.

J	Jost-Stauffer, M				Jost-Stauffer, M			A Holocene fossil coleopteran (beetle) assemblage from the Central Swiss Alps: Climate and ecology	ECLOGAE GEOLOGICAE HELVETIAE												The beetle fauna of a fen peat melted out in pieces from below the retreating Unteraar Glacier was examined. The sediment (12 kg of peat) yielded more than 5000 insect fragments. Identification of the fossils provided a detailed picture about palaeoenvironment in the Gletschervorfeld 3600-3800 yr BP ago. Coleopterans living in marshy alpine areas near lakes and running water associated with reeds and moss dominate the assemblage. Species indicating persisting snow patches even during summer months are Helophorus glacialis and Nebria castanea. Many of the specimens reported live in flowering meadows and shrubs (often Rhododendron, Alnus, Salix). There are several species in the assemblage which are not known to live in the alpine zone (e.g. Stenus bifoveolatus, Gymnusa brevicollis). Those observations and the total absence of tree-dependent species suggest that the ancient Cyperaceae fen peal was growing in the subalpine dwarf-shrub, heath - above the forest limit but below the treeline. From the finding of wood fragments in the same deposits, the presence of isolated trees can bs inferred, probably on the slopes where the conditions were locally more favourable. Reconstructed July temperatures based on the beetle assemblage yielded a mean value similar to today's temperature measured 5.5 km east from the site at Grimsel Hospiz.																			0012-9402						2000	93	3					481	490																WOS:000166588500014

Effects of land use changes on climate in the Greater Horn of Africa	CLIMATE RESEARCH												The relationships between historical land use transformations and spatio-temporal patterns of precipitation and temperature over the Greater Horn of Africa (GHA) were examined based on Landsat satellite observations for the years 1986, 1995, and 2000 and regional climate model simulations in the period 1991-2000. The satellite-derived land use/cover classification shows increased conversion of large portions of forests over the GHA to agriculture, particularly in Kenya, with land (acreage) under crops increasing from 6.55% in 1986 to almost 18% by the year 2000. Sensitivity experiments performed with regional climate model, Version 4 (RegCM4), indicate that expanding agriculture into forested areas led to a modest reduction in monthly rainfall totals and also may be contributing to notable shifts in moisture convergence zones and centers of rainfall maxima. Student's t-test at a 0.1 significant level showed a decrease in precipitation and an increase in surface temperature around the lake region when surface vegetation cover is converted to agricultural land cover type. Conversely, under the assumption that large sections of croplands are converted to forest, the simulations resulted in a modest increase in precipitation and a reduction of surface temperature around the lake region, changes that are significant at the 0.1 confidence level. A substantial trade-off in the components of the surface energy balance between sensible heat flux (SHF) and latent heat flux (LHF) was observed for the different conversion types. Under the assumption of reforestation, both SHF and LHF increased. The increase in SHF was almost twice that of LHF. On the other hand, when land cover types were converted to agricultural types, SHF decreased, while LHF did not show any significant change.

J	Hammond, WC; Thatcher, W				Hammond, William C.; Thatcher, Wayne			Crustal deformation across the Sierra Nevada, northern Walker Lane, Basin and Range transition, western United States measured with GPS, 2000-2004	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH												Global Positioning System ( GPS) data collected in campaigns in 2000 and 2004 were processed and interpreted with other GPS data in the western Basin and Range province to provide new constraints on the rate, style, and pattern of deformation of the central and northern Walker Lane ( WL), which lies near the western boundary of the Basin and Range. Across the central WL, near 38 degrees N latitude, the velocities with respect to North America increase westward by similar to 10 mm/yr inducing dextral shear. Farther north between 40 degrees and 41 degrees N latitude, a western zone of similar to 7 mm/yr relative motion undergoes dextral shear, and an eastern zone of <= 3 mm/yr relative motion undergoes extension and shear. These data show that the northern WL is essentially a dextral shear zone experiencing minor net dilatation ( epsilon(Delta) = 2.6 +/- 0.8 nstrain/yr). Near most Holocene normal faults, dilatation inferred from the velocity field is not greater than the uncertainties. However, near the central Nevada seismic belt we detect significant dilatation expressed as extension in a direction approximately normal to the range fronts ( epsilon(Delta) = 23.0 +/- 3.9 nstrain/yr), some of which is attributable to transient postseismic deformation following large historic earthquakes. A block model constrained by velocities corrected for transient effects shows that the sum of dextral slip rates across the Honey Lake, Warm Springs, east Pyramid fault system, and Mohawk Valley faults is similar to 7 mm/yr. The WL is a zone whose width and dilatation rate increase northwestward, consistent with counterclockwise rotation of the Sierra Nevada microplate and transfer of deformation into the Pacific Northwest.																			2169-9313	2169-9356				MAY 12	2007	112	B5							B05411	10.1029/2006JB004625	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2006JB004625													WOS:000246498600004

A post-Calumet shoreline along southern Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY					47th Annual Meeting of the International-Association-for-Great-Lakes-Research	MAY 24-28, 2004	Univ Waterloo, Waterloo, CANADA	Int Assoc Great Lakes Res	Univ Waterloo			The southern shore of Lake Michigan is the type area for many of ancestral Lake Michigan's late Pleistocene lake phases, but coastal deposits and features of the Algonquin phase of northern Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, and Lake Superior are not recognized in the area. Isostatic rebound models suggest that Algonquin phase deposits should be 100 m or more below modern lake level. A relict shoreline, however, exists along the lakeward margin of the Calumet Beach that was erosional west of Deep River and depositional east of the river. For this post-Calumet shoreline, the elevation of basal foreshore deposits east of Deep River and the base of the scarp west of Deep River indicate a slightly westward dipping water plane that is centered at similar to 184 m above mean sea level. Basal foreshore elevations also indicate that lake level fell similar to 2 m during the development of the shoreline. The pooled mean of radiocarbon dates from the surface of the peat below post-Calumet shoreline foreshore deposits indicate that the lake transgressed over the peat at 10,560 +/- 70 years B.P. Pollen assemblages from the peat are consistent with this age. The elevation and age of the post-Calumet shoreline are similar to the Main Algonquin phase of Lake Huron. Recent isostatic rebound models do not adequately address a high-elevation Algonquin-age shoreline along the southern shore of Lake Michigan, but the Goldthwait (1908) hinge-line model does.					; Thompson, Todd/G-6579-2011; Booth, Robert/G-5563-2010	Booth, Robert/0000-0002-9264-4959; Thompson, Todd/0000-0001-6266-2630; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				APR	2007	37	3					395	409		10.1007/s10933-006-9046-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-006-9046-1													WOS:000244485300007

The authors point out to the diverse nature of the river network resulting from the natural topography of Poland and the fact that the contemporary river network uses valleys inherited from the past. Systems of two largest Polish allochthonous (transit) rivers, the Vistula and the Oder, are characterised. The rivers of Przymorze and the Niemen basin are discussed in less detail. The paper shows that the stability of discharge in Polish rivers, resulting from climate conditions (precipitation exceeding field evaporation over the entire water year), is determined by the underground contributor to the discharge, which is a result of underground water drainage by the river channels. The contribution of underground runoff to the total discharge of Polish rivers is generally stable over the year, and the percentage of surface runoff contributing to the total discharge depends on the morphogenetic zone (mountains, highlands, lowlands) where these rivers flow. Finally, the types of regimes characterising Polish rivers are presented and their spatial differentiation is discussed. Polish rivers are characterised by complex regimes. Most rivers are characterised by the moderately developed nival regime with the high water period in the spring. Some of the lowland rivers have well-developed nival regime, while some lakeland rivers are characterised by the poorly developed nival regime. The regimes of mountain rivers vary.

Environmental Factors Impacting the Development of Toxic Cyanobacterial Proliferations in a Central Texas Reservoir	TOXINS												Cyanobacterial harmful algal proliferations (cyanoHAPs) are increasingly associated with dog and livestock deaths when benthic mats break free of their substrate and float to the surface. Fatalities have been linked to neurotoxicosis from anatoxins, potent alkaloids produced by certain genera of filamentous cyanobacteria. After numerous reports of dog illnesses and deaths at a popular recreation site on Lady Bird Lake, Austin, Texas in late summer 2019, water and floating mat samples were collected from several sites along the reservoir. Water quality parameters were measured and mat samples were maintained for algal isolation and DNA identification. Samples were also analyzed for cyanobacterial toxins using LC-MS. Dihydroanatoxin-a was detected in mat materials from two of the four sites (0.6-133 ng/g wet weight) while water samples remained toxin-free over the course of the sampling period; no other cyanobacterial toxins were detected. DNA sequencing analysis of cyanobacterial isolates yielded a total of 11 genera, including Geitlerinema, Tyconema, Pseudanabaena, and Phormidium/Microcoleus, taxa known to produce anatoxins, including dihydroanatoxin, among other cyanotoxins. Analyses indicate that low daily upriver dam discharge, higher TP and NO3 concentrations, and day of the year were the main parameters associated with the presence of toxic floating cyanobacterial mats.

Conversion from forested to agricultural land began during the 1820s and was largely completed by 1890. Erosional P inputs to Lake Simcoe sediments increased from pre-agricultural loads of about 30-100 t . yr(-1) by the 1940s. Point-source loads of P first appeared about 1910, remained low at 2-3 t . yr(-1) until the 1960s, then increased to about 20 t . yr(-1) by 1990, as human population in the basin increased from about 50 000 to > 250 000 residents. Recruitment failure of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis), and lake herring (Coregonus artedii), occurred during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, respectively, as hypolimnetic water quality deteriorated. The volume-weighted, temperature-corrected hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen concentration from August 30 to September 19 declined from about 4.5 mg . L(-1) in 1975 to 2.0 mg . L(-1) by 1993. During late summer, 1975-1993, 60-98% of the 6-12 degrees C thermal habitat volume had < 7 mg . L(-1) dissolved oxygen, and 10-50% had < 3 mg . L(-1), the incipient lethal threshold for lake trout. Reduction of P loads to surface waters and restoration of cold-water fish habitat are now the explicit management goals of the Lake Simcoe Environmental Management Strategy.																			0706-652X						1996	53			1			194	218		10.1139/cjfas-53-S1-194	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-53-S1-194													WOS:A1996VK06200020

This location has been a primary reason for important geomorphic environmental changes at this area in Quaternary. This study consists a modelling of geomorphic environmental changes at Uluabat and Manyas Lakes and their close surroundings. In modelling, paleoclimatic, paleomorphologic, paleobotanic, paleopedologic, and archeologic data have been evaluated together. Also, especially, boring data of Quaternary stratigraphy have been used. Lithological data, earthquake records of historical and instrumental eras, and contemporary geomorphological analysis results have contributed a great deal to this study The study area was probably a lagoonary environment which was connected to Marmara Sea during upper Miocene. Tectonical movements which began at that time and continued up to now have caused horizontal and vertical displacements also affecting streams resulting in drainage deformations and base level changes, which conform with such an alteration. Accordingly, six basic stages can be diferentiated belonging to geomorphologic development of sutdy area. In the last section, compare between 1965 and 2001 geomorphological features of area. As the factors and processes are still current at Uluabat and Manyas Lakes, geomorphic environmental changes that took place in a time span of 35 years are an indicator for extinction of these lakes in near future.

'Tami G' grape tomato response to nitrogen rates	PROCEEDINGS OF THE IVTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MANAGING QUALITY IN CHAINS, VOLS 1 AND 2: THE INTEGRATED VIEW ON FRUITS AND VEGETABLES QUALITY	Acta Horticulturae				4th International Conference on Managing Quality in Chains	AUG 07-10, 2006	Bangkok, THAILAND					Grape tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) have recently gained in popularity among consumers because they can be eaten without being cut, they are deep red in color, and their flavor is intense and pleasant. Current N fertilization recommendations have been developed for determinate tomato varieties that have a 3-month long growing season, whereas that of the indeterminate grape cultivars may be up to six months. 'Tami G' grape tomatoes (previously identified as a suitable alternative to 'Santa') were grown on a Lakeland fine sand at the North Florida Research and Education Center-Suwannee Valley, near Live Oak, FL in the Spring of 2005 using standard plasticulture practices under 0%, 33%, 66%, 100%, 133%, and 166% of the current recommended rate for round tomato (224 kg/ha). Tomatoes were transplanted 24 Mar. and harvested, weighed and graded five times between 10 June and 15 July. Soluble solid concentrations (SSC) were also measured at each harvest. Season marketable (SMY, kg/ha) and total yield (TY, kg/ha) response to N rates were quadratic (SMY = -0.16 Nrate(2) + 140 Nrate + 11,821 R-2 = 0.56; CV = 32%; TY = -0.18 Nrate(2) + 153 Nrate + 13949; R-2 = 0.54, CV = 32%; both p < 0.01). Highest SMY and TY occurred between 314 and 392 kg/ha N rates. N rate effect on SMY and TY was significant only for harvest 4 and 5. SSC ranged from 6.25 to 7.5 degrees Brix for harvests I to 4 and was not significantly affected by N rate. On harvest 5, SSC tended to be greater with higher N rates. These preliminary results suggest that N fertilization for grape tomato could be done by incorporating 56 to 78 kg/ha of N in the bed, followed by daily rates ranging from 0.5 to 3.5 kg/ha/day. Because the length of the growing season for grape tomato may vary, emphasis should be placed on daily N rates and irrigation management, rather than on seasonal N rate.																			0567-7572	2406-6168	90-6605-539-1				2006		712					491	+		10.17660/ActaHortic.2006.712.59	http://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2006.712.59													WOS:000240595100059

Two removal mechanisms were characterized: (1) sorption to and subsequent transport with falling particles and (2) direct adsorption to surface sediments. Our approach was to measure independently the kinetics of radiotracer sorption, fluxes and concentrations for particles, particle settling velocities, and the "equivalent stagnant boundary film". Our radiotracer results enabled us to test the sensitivity of the tracer removal rates on these rate-determining processes using a numerical transport model. Acid titrations of whole ecosystems revealed that some trace metals (e.g Mn, Co, and Zn) can diffuse back to the water column as the pH is lowered from 6.5 to 4.8 after 18 d, while others remain tightly bound (e.g. Sn, Fe, Se, Cr, Ag, and Hg isotopes). Subsequent CaCO3 additions to bring back the pH to its original value restored the initial removal conditions for acid-sensitive radiotracers, indicating that the pH sensitivity is reversible. Transport parameters for particle-related pathways or diffusive pathways across the sediment-water interface obtained from our enclosure experiments were used to predict the removal rates of "particle-reactive" 60Co and the "diffusive" pathway tracer 134Cs observed in earlier experiments where radiotracers were added to whole lakes or to larger enclosures.					; Santschi, Peter/D-5712-2012	Santschi, Peter H./0000-0001-8188-7691; Anderson, Robert/0000-0002-8472-2494													0706-652X	1205-7533				JAN	1986	43	1					60	77		10.1139/f86-008	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f86-008													WOS:A1986AYV4700008

The local people have relied on karst lakes as the primary water source for various activities, such as bathing and cloth washing. Bembem Doline Pond is located in Giriasih Village, Purwosari District, Gunungkidul Regency and is part of the Panggang Subsystem. Aside from its intensive use, many factors are contributing to its water quality degradation, namely seasons, doline pond characteristics (e.g., water volume), landuse on the watershed, and the pattern of water use. This research intended to identify (1) the characteristics and (2) the water quality of Bembem Doline Pond in the early and mid-rainy season. For the water quality analysis, samples were collected from five points, which were selected by purposive sampling technique. This sampling took into account the location of the water inflow and part of the doline pond where human activities took place in November 2018 and January 2019. The test included three types of water parameters, namely physical (temperature, EC, and TDS), chemical (pH, nitrate, phosphate, detergent, and BOD), and biological (total coliform). The results showed that the water volume of Bembem Doline Pond in the mid of rainy season is 1,467.4 m(3). Landuse in the watershed are dominated by plantation (45%) and dry farmland (34%), and some were covered by water bodies (14%), roads (2%), buildings (4%), and settlements (1%). The water quality of the doline pond was found to depend on seasons and human activities on the doline pond considerably. The pollutant levels inclined to be higher in the early than the mid-rainy season. In the former, human activities mostly played a part as pollutant supplier, while in the latter, runoff water from agricultural fields in the watershed contributed the most. According to the Regulation of the Governor of the Special Region of Yogyakarta No. 20 of 2008, the majority of the test parameters exceeded the quality standards for Class II water.

In this study, ultra-trace element water geochemistry, with emphasis on the rare earth elements and yttrium (REY), was tested as a tool to fingerprint groundwater origin and pathways within a lowland karst aquifer network. The study area is well-defined from a hydrological perspective and provides an excellent natural system to investigate geochemical characteristics of allogenic and autogenic water mixing within a karst network. The new geochemical data have yielded refined insight into the temporal fluxes of water at different hydrological times of the year and, in particular, proved important for quantifying contributions of autogenic and allogenic runoff to the ephemeral karst lakes (known as turloughs) which emerge after surcharge of the karst conduit network following periods of high flows. Endmember definitions of the allogenic waters derived from rivers draining a catchment of predominantly Devonian Old Red sandstone vs. autogenic waters derived from limestone in contact within the karst network were established from REY pattern slope (Pr/Yb), Y/Ho ratio, and a number of other ratios generated from contrasting enrichments of high-solubility/low-particle reactivity elements that exhibited conservative or near-conservative behaviour (e.g,. Sr, Ba, Li, U, Mo). Under high-flow conditions, waters within the surcharged conduit network fall on mixing lines between the endmembers, and these relationships can be used to quantify the relative contribution of each water source in the conduit network. In contrast, under low-flow conditions the endmembers could still be defined but the geochemical mixing relationships in the aquifer network appear to have been complicated by enhanced particle reactivity in soil reservoirs prior to both autogenic and allogenic recharge. In addition, we show that seawater influx into the karst network influenced the mixed conduit geochemistry under lower flow conditions.

Tempo and Mode of Diversification of Lake Tanganyika Cichlid Fishes	PLOS ONE												Background: Understanding the causes of disparities in species diversity across taxonomic groups and regions is a fundamental aim in evolutionary biology. Addressing these questions is difficult because of the need for densely sampled phylogenies and suitable empirical systems. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we investigate the cichlid fish radiation of Lake Tanganyika and show that per lineage diversification rates have been more than six times slower than in the species flocks of Lakes Victoria and Malawi. The result holds even at peak periods of diversification in Lake Tanganyika, ruling out the age of the lake as an explanation for slow average rates, and is robust to uncertainties over the calibration of cichlid radiations in geological time. Moreover, Lake Tanganyika lineages, irrespective of different biological characteristics ( e. g. sexually dichromatic versus sexually monochromatic clades), have diversified at similar rates, falling within typical estimates across a range of plant and animal clades. For example, the mostly sexually dichromatic haplochromines, which have speciated explosively in Lakes Victoria and Malawi, have displayed modest rates in Lake Tanganyika ( where they are called Tropheini). Conclusion/Significance: Our results show that either the Lake Tanganyika environment is less conducive for cichlid speciation or the remarkable diversifying abilities of the haplochromines were inhibited by the prior occupancy of older radiations. Although the results indicate a dominant role for the environment in shaping cichlid diversification, differences in the timing of diversification among the Tanganyikan tribes indicate that biological differences were still important for the dynamics of species build-up in the lake. While we cannot resolve the timing of the radiation relative to the origin of the lake, because of the lack of robust geological date calibrations for cichlids, our results are consistent with a scenario that the different clades reflect independent adaptive radiations into different broad niches in the lake.

Frequent regime shifts in trophic states in shallow lakes on the Boreal Plain: Alternative "unstable" states?	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Shallow lakes are known to exhibit alternative states in their biotic structure. Lakes dominated by submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV) are "clear,'' while lakes dominated by algae (high concentrations of chlorophyll a [Chl a]) are "turbid.'' The roles of total phosphorus (TP) and SAV in defining these alternative states were examined for up to 6 yr in 24 naturally eutrophic shallow lakes (12.4-670.4 mu g TP L-1) with variable SAV cover (0-100%) on the western Boreal Plain in Alberta, Canada. Clear lakes had,18 mu g Chl a L-1. Sixty-seven percent of lakes were clear in any given year, but individual lakes did not remain clear over consecutive years. While 29% did not switch, 71% of lakes were unstable, with 57% switching states once and 14% switching more than once. To increase the temporal and spatial scale of analysis, we used Landsat Thematic Mapper satellite imagery (1984 2003) to classify clarity for up to 20 yr in 82 naturally eutrophic shallow lakes. Approximately 80% of lakes were unstable, with 7% switching once and more than 73% switching 2-9 times. Only 20% of lakes were stable and clear. Switches in lake clarity were related to TP but were also dependent on the abundance of SAV. For lakes with high SAV, the TP threshold for the transition from clear to turbid was 275 mu g TP L-1, while for lakes with low SAV, the TP threshold was 50 mu g TP L-1. Given the harsh winter conditions, including lakes with ice depths of up to 0.7 m and anoxia leading to winterkill of aquatic communities, these systems are strongly abiotically regulated and lack mechanisms that maintain a lake in a stable state.

Modeling specular reflections from hydrocarbon lakes on Titan	ICARUS												During the 58th close flyby of Titan (T58), the Cassini Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) observed a specular reflection of sunlight from Titan's Jingpo Lacus through the 5-mu m methane window (Stephan, K. et al. [2010]. Geophys. Res. Lett. 37, L07104). The maximum intensity of this reflection is controlled by three basic factors: (1) the shape of the reflecting surface (its overall geometry and roughness), (2) the reflectance of the surface, as controlled by the real refractive index of the material (and that of the atmosphere), and (3) attenuation due to absorption and scattering by atmospheric gases and aerosols along the pathlength. Herein we model the expected intensity of a specular reflection off of a convex mirror-like surface on Titan. We assume the specular reflection is from a body of liquid hydrocarbons on Titan's surface with optical properties consistent with CH4 and C2H6 with smaller amounts of nitrogen and heavier hydrocarbons (e.g., C3H8) admixed. We assume the 5-mu m opacity for the polar atmosphere is a factor of two higher than that of the tropical haze. For the geometry of the T58 observations, our model predicts a maximum I/F = 1-to-5; for a Lambertian surface at normal illumination I/F = 1. The maximum 5-mu m intensity observed during T58 was I/F similar to 2.6, from which we conclude that Jingpo Lacus is filled with a liquid that has a real index of refraction consistent with that of methane-ethane-nitrogen liquid and that the 5-mu m atmospheric opacity was tau = 0.5, consistent with the higher particle column expected in the winter polar atmosphere. Future VIMS observations will allow us to refine the refractive index of the liquid in the lakes and to place a quantitative constraint on the ratio of methane to ethane. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The phases of expansions and declines of Oaks with decline and increase of Pines and grasses probably occurred under increase (warm-moist) and decrease (cool-dry) of S.W. monsoon precipitation respectively. The increasing trend of S.W. monsoon and temperature is recorded during similar to 44,000 to 34,000 cal yr BP synchronizing with the peat development, and which peaked at around 35,000 cal yr BP. This may link to the interstadial phase during the last major glacial cycle in the Himalayan region. It is also reflected in the decline of delta C-13 value indicating dominance of C-3 type of vegetation. The increased values of chi F13%, and lower values chi LF magnetic susceptibility, recorded during the phase of the peat deposit, further advocate's higher monsoon intensity. Impact of expansion of glacier felt with peak (LGM) around 20,000 cal yr BP is perceived. Tree line had moved to lower altitudes due to increased aridity and low temperature. During this time existence of savannah type of vegetation is also evident by the increase of C4 taxa. Decreased FD% and increased chi LF susceptibility also indicate reduced S.W. monsoon intensity.

First, we offered C-14- labeled algal detritus to stage III, stage IV (two different physiological groups), and adult females of Acanthocyclops vernalis from temporary water-bodies of the Volga Delta. Second, we compared the functional responses of active and actively diapausing cyclopoids preying on copepod nauplii. Stage III, stage IV (various physiological groups), stage V, adult males and females of Acanthocyclops viridis, Cyclops kolensis, C. abyssorum sevani from the Volga Delta, Lake Sevan (Armenia), and Mozhaisk Reservoir (Moscow District) were tested. Finally, we examined the activity of digestive enzymes (proteases) of CIV of C. kolensis from Mozhaisk Reservoir at different temperatures and temperature acclimation regimes. All three approaches used have led to similar conclusions. Actively diapausing cyclopoids were capable of feeding on both plant and animal prey; however, their feeding rates and digestive enzyme activity were 2-8 times lower than those of active cyclopoids of similar size. At the initial stage of active diapause the feeding rates were comparable with those of active cyclopoids then declined to a low level during approximately two weeks. Transfer of cyclopoids undergoing winter diapause from ambient temperature (4 degrees C) to warmer water (20 degrees C) resulted in dramatic increase of proteases activity only if the acclimation period was relatively long (two weeks).					alekseev, victor/C-7086-2014	Alekseev, Victor/0000-0002-1968-2609													0018-8158					MAR 1	1996	320	1-3					71	79		10.1007/BF00016806	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00016806													WOS:A1996UE14900008

Cladoceran species richness declined significantly with increasing SAL, TP and TN, while no significant correlation was found to either PL-CPUE, macrophyte coverage or lake surface area. Bonferroni-adjusted forward selection within canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) showed that 22.1% of the variation in zooplankton data was explained by PL-CPUE, SAL and TP uniquely; each variable explaining an almost equally significant amount of variation in the zooplankton data. Predictive models to infer PL-CPUE, SAL and TP were developed using variance weighted-averaging (WA) procedures. Almost similar values of boot-strapped coefficient of determination (r(boot-strapped)(2) 0.22-038) were produced by the WA inference models of PL-CPUE, SAL and TP, while the inference models of TP produced the lowest boot-strapped root-mean-squared-error of prediction (RMSEPboot-strapped 0.29-0.36 log(TP + 1), mug l(-1)). Yet, zooplankton TP and SAL optima (WA) were strongly correlated (r(2) = 0.46), while PL-CPUE optima (WA) were independent of both TP and SAL optima, indicating that only the PL-CPUE inference models are suitable for making reconstructions.

It is the hotspot for paleoclimate research in East Asia. In this study, we reconstructed the environmental evolution of the Lake Qinghai since similar to 9 ka by using a high-resolution peat and fluvial-lacustrine record (Laoyinggou profile) obtained at the foot of Nanshan Mountain. Based on 8 AMS(14)C dates and lithology, loss on ignition (LOI), total organic matter (TOC), X-ray fluorescence (XRF) core-scanning measurements, ratio of total organic carbon to nitrogen (TOC/TN), and sediment particle sorting coefficients, we show that during the Middle Holocene (similar to 9-4.4 ka BP) this region was primarily dominated by the Asian summer monsoon, with a consistent, warm, and humid environment. By contrast, during the late Holocene (4.4 ka to present), the climatic context in this area fluctuated dramatically at the millennial scales. The low TOC content, lower TOC/TN ration and strong hydroclimatic indicate six rapid climate change events, which occurred at similar to 4.0 ka, similar to 3.6 ka, similar to 3.2 ka, similar to 2.8 ka, similar to 2.1 ka, and similar to 1.4 ka, all of which coincided to cold episodes in the North Atlantic Ocean.

The early evolutional phase of the Jehol Biota is best recorded in the Members 2 and 3 of the Dabeigou Formation (D-M2-3) in the Luanping Basin and their equivalent Huajiying Formation in the Senjitu-Sichakou Basin in northern Hebei Province. To date, however, no complete, high-resolution time scale has been established for these early Jehol Biota-bearing strata, hindering our understanding of the origin of the Jehol Biota. Here we carried out a cyclostratigraphic analysis using a high-resolution relative lake level variation record, called "depth ranks" (i.e., a series of numerically ranked sedimentary facies) in the-185-m-thick, continuously lacustrine D-M2-3 in the Yushuxia section, Luanping Basin. Our results suggest that the climate/lake level fluctuations in the Luanping Basin during the development of the early Jehol Biota were strongly paced by orbital cycles, including the 405 kyr and -100 kyr eccentricity and -34 kyr obliquity and -21 kyr precession. By anchoring the 405 kyr-tuned depth ranks to a relatively high-precise zircon U-Pb age of one tuff layer at the base of Member 3 (131.5 +/- 0.4 Ma), we built a high-resolution astronomical time scale, spanning from 132.4 to 130.7 Ma, for the D-M2-3, indicating a -1.7 Myr duration of the early Jehol Biota and an average sedimentation rate of-11 cm/kyr of the D-M2-3 in the Luanping Basin. In addition, we suggest that the periods characterized by warm summer, enhanced hydrological cycle and expanded lake at high obliquity and low precession at eccentricity maximum were most conducive for both development and preservation of the early Jehol Biota.					; Wang, He/JCO-3900-2023; Xu, Chunpeng/GZL-6879-2022; Zhang, Haichun/KIA-0228-2024; Li, Sha/IVV-6560-2023	XUE, Naihua/0000-0001-6443-1377; Zhang, Haichun/0000-0003-4553-8317; 													0031-0182	1872-616X				DEC 1	2022	607								111273	10.1016/j.palaeo.2022.111273	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2022.111273		OCT 2022											WOS:000917301400005
J	Laird, NF; Kristovich, DAR; Walsh, JE				Laird, NF; Kristovich, DAR; Walsh, JE			Idealized model simulations examining the mesoscale structure of winter lake-effect circulations	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												An array of 35 idealized mesoscale model simulations was used to examine environmental and surface forcing factors controlling the meso-b-scale circulation structure resulting from cold flow over an isolated axisymmetric body of water at the midlatitudes. Wind speed, lake-air temperature difference, ambient atmospheric stability, and fetch distance were varied across previously observed ranges. Simulated meso-b-scale lake-effect circulations occurred within three basic regimes (e. g., vortices, shoreline bands, widespread coverage), similar to observed morphological regimes. The current study found that the morphological regimes of lake-effect circulations can be predicted using the ratio of wind speed to maximum fetch distance (U/L). Lake-effect environmental conditions producing low values of U/L (i.e., approximately, 0.02 m s(-1) km(-1)) resulted in a mesoscale vortex circulation. Conditions leading to U/L values between about 0.02 and 0.09 m s(-1) km(-1) resulted in the development of a shoreline band, and U/L values greater than approximately 0.09 m s(-1) km(-1) produced a widespread coverage event. It was found that transitions from one morphological regime to another are continuous and within transitional zones the structure of a circulation may contain structural features characteristic of more than one regime. Results show that 1) the U/L criterion effectively classifies the morphology independently of the lake- air temperature difference for the parameter value combinations examined and 2) the Froude number, suggested as a potential lake- effect forecasting tool in previous studies, does not permit the unique classification of lake-effect morphology.

AHS from the Wakarusa River and Clinton Lake originated from riparian forest vegetation, reflected respective effects of soil organic matter and aquatic algal/bacterial sources, and bore evidence of biological degradation and photodegradation. AHS from the Wakarusa River showed the effect of terrestrial sources, whereas Clinton Lake humic acid also reflected aquatic algal/bacterial sources. Greater amounts of carbon attributable to tannin-derived chemical structures may correspond with higher HAAS and THM4 yields for Clinton Lake fulvic acid. Prior to appreciable leaf-fall from deciduous trees, the combined (humic and fulvic acid) THM4 formation potentials for the Wakarusa River approached the proposed EPA THM4 Stage I MCL of 80 mug/L, and the combined THM4 formation potential for Clinton Lake slightly exceeded the proposed THM4 Stage II MCL of 40 mug/L. Finally, AHS from Clinton Lake could account for most (>70%) of the THM4 concentrations in finished water from the Clinton Lake Water Treatment Plant based on September 23, 1996, THM4 results.

This microbial community had the capacity to rapidly oxidize CH4 at concentrations ranging from < 1 ppm (microliters per liter) (first-order rate constant [k]= -0.54 h-1) to > 104 ppm (k = -2.37 h-1). The physiological characteristics of a methanotroph isolated from the soil (characteristics determined in aqueous medium) and the natural population; however, were similar to those of other natural populations and cultures: the Q10 and optimum temperature were 1.9 and 31.degree. C, respectively, the apparent half-saturation constant was 2.5 to 9.3 .mu.M, and 19 to 69% of oxidized CH4 was assimilated into biomass. The CH4 oxidation rate of this soil under waterlogged (41% [wt/vol] H2O) conditions, 6.1 mg liter-1 day-1, was near rates reported for lake sediment and much lower than the rate of 116 mg liter-1 day-1 in the same soil under moist (11% H2O) conditions. Since there are no large physiological differences between this microbial community and other CH4 oxidizers, we attribute the high CH4 oxidation rate in moist soil to enhanced CH4 transport to the microorganisms; gas-phase molecular diffusion is 104-fold faster than aqueous diffusion. These high CH4 oxidation rates in moist soil have implications that are important in global climate change. Soil CH4 oxidation could become a negative feedback to atmospheric CH4 increases (and warming) in areas that are presently waterlogged but are projected to undergo a reduction in summer soil moisture.																			0099-2240	1098-5336				NOV	1990	56	11					3405	3411		10.1128/AEM.56.11.3405-3411.1990	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.56.11.3405-3411.1990								16348346					WOS:A1990EF66300027
J	ANDERSON, NJ; RIPPEY, B				ANDERSON, NJ; RIPPEY, B			DIAGENESIS OF MAGNETIC MINERALS IN THE RECENT SEDIMENTS OF A EUTROPHIC LAKE	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Magnetic mineral assemblages in lake sediments are usually interpreted as reflecting changing catchment erosion. Magnetic and chemical assemblages in a small eutrophic lake (Lough Augher, Northern Ireland [UK]) suggest diagenetic dissolution of fine-grained magnetic, however, probably as a result of changing redox conditions associated with eutrophication. Water-column results show internal cycling of Mn and Fe from the sediments into the anoxic hypolimnion. Calculations suggest that late-summer hypolimnetic Fe concentrations are controlled by formation of authigenic vivianite; sedimentary pore-water concentrations of total soluble Fe and P suggest a similar process in the sediments. The loss of Mn from the lake by diffusion from the sediment and washout at overturn is indicated by Mn budget calculations and by a marked decrease in its sedimentary concentration, reflecting onset of eutrophication as indicated by diatom biostratigraphy. The changes in the sediment Mn profiles are coincident with, and in some cases identical to, changes in several magnetic parameters. The changes in magnetic stratigraphy suggest a coarsening of the magnetic grain size and reduction in the total concentration; agreement with chemical profiles indicative of changing redox suggest that this coarsening results from dissolution of fine-grained magnetite. Catchment stability, together with other stratigraphic profiles of eutrophication and changing redox, supports the conclusion that the magnetic profiles are reflecting in situ diagenetic changes rather than altered catchment processes. With the data available it is not possible to identify the actual dissolution process involved or to determine whether it is chemically or bacterially controlled.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	1988	33	6	2				1476	1492		10.4319/lo.1988.33.6_part_2.1476	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1988.33.6_part_2.1476													WOS:A1988T062700005
J	STOBER, QJ; TYLER, RW				STOBER, QJ; TYLER, RW			RULE CURVES FOR IRRIGATION DRAWDOWN AND KOKANEE SALMON (ONCORHYNCHUS-NERKA) EGG TO FRY SURVIVAL	FISHERIES RESEARCH												The survival of kokanee salmon (O. nerka) eggs and pre-emergent fry in the shoreline spawning areas of Banks Lake, Washington, USA, is reduced by annual drawdown of the reservoir. Kokanee salmon spawn exclusively along steep talus shorelines during the months of Oct. and Nov. No suitable spawning streams enter the lake and nearly all water is pumped into this irrigation reservoir from Lake Roosevelt on the Columbia River. Preferred spawning depths range from 1.5-4.6 m, but when large populations were present spawning was observed to 13.7 m. Fry emergence was estimated at depth intervals from conical trap catches deployed in an array over a major spawning area in the reservoir. Emergence occurred from late March to early June, but the timing of maximum emergence shifted from April 28 to May 10 during 3 consecutive years due to changes in the thermal regimes during incubation. The relationships between the depth range of spawning area, timing of spawning, egg incubation and fry emergence, and the spring reservoir drawdown for 1977, 1978 and 1979 were analyzed graphically. Rule curves defining rate and magnitude of reservoir drawdown to achieve 75% fry emergence were developed. These rule curves can be used to determine a water management strategy for natural kokanee salmon production or to estimate the loss when exceeded.																			0165-7836	1872-6763					1982	1	3					195	218																WOS:A1982PP35900002

External phosphate load is large (about 250 t y(-1) of P are discharged to the lake) but internal flux also has to be taken into account. The potential of P release at the sediment-water interface was studied. Not all forms of phosphate are likely to be released, to know which part of the pool can be mobilized we used sequential extraction. In Bort-les-Orgues about 80% of P, mostly iron-bound, was mobile. The percentage of calcium-bound P did not exceed 20%. Phosphate and iron fluxes were measured in a laboratory experiment. As long as oxygen concentration remained above 0.5 mg l(-1), no release was observed. Phosphate and iron were released together when oxygen dropped to 0.5 mg l(-1) and redox potential reached - 350 mV at the sediment-water interface. Such conditions were common during summer, and the corresponding P flux was 18 mg m(-2) d(-1) PO4-P. This internal phosphate source should be taken into account in any project of lake restoration. Sequential extraction of phosphate and flux measurement are thus necessary tools for a better management of eutrophic water bodies.																			0018-8158						1998	374						349	359																WOS:000076609900028

This report describes cases of churrido equino and provides serologic, pathologic, and DNA-based evidence indicating that the disease is in fact equine monocytic ehrlichiosis (Potomac horse fever). Results of an epidemiological investigation conducted on an endemic farm are also presented. Clinical signs in 12 horses were fever, depression, diarrhea, dehydration, and sometimes colic and distal hind limb edema. Postmortem findings of 3 horses were of acute enterocolitis. Inclusion bodies containing ehrlichial organisms were found in the cytoplasm of macrophages of the large colon of 1 horse. Eleven of the 12 horses were serologically positive to Ehrlichia risticii (indirect fluorescent antibody assay) and, of 3 paired samples, 2 showed seroconversion. Ehrlichia risticii DNA was identified by a nested polymerase chain reaction in peripheral blood of an affected horse. A healthy horse inoculated with peripheral blood from an affected horse developed the disease and antibodies to E. risticii. The disease had a peak incidence in March (summer) and was statistically associated with a marshy ecosystem near the Merin lake, where large numbers of Pomacea spp. (Ampullariidae) snails were found. Incidence density was almost 8 times higher in normative horses than in native horses. It was concluded that the previous diarrheic disease of horses known in Uruguay and southern Brazil as churrido equino is equine monocytic ehrlichiosis.

Data for population estimates were collected concurrently by a high-frequency echosounder and a midwater trawl whose efficiency was inversely related to ambient light above 1.9 .times. 10-5 1X. Echogram counts supplemented by trawl catches yielded estimates with low variance, good resolution between age-groups, and indicated close correlation between numbers of spawners and resultant progeny within respective treatments. Survival to the fall for the treated 1969-72 brood yr averaged 11.65% (range 11.11-12.81%) of potential egg deposition compared to 3.5% for the pretreatment 1968 brood yr fish; 2.73 and 6.29% for the posttreatment 1974 and 1975 brood yr fish. A carry-over of fertilization effects on the immediate posttreatment 1973 brood yr may have induced a cyclic pattern on the survival of the 2 succeeding year-classes. The relatively consistent annual production of age 0+ sockeye may be due to the inherent stability of intake spawning and incubation coupled with the low predation rates. The conservative estimate of a 2.5 increase in survival relative to the natural level indicates a positive response to enhanced feeding conditions caused by the fertilization of this oligotrophic lake.																									1978	35	6					851	860		10.1139/f78-136	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f78-136													WOS:A1978EZ40800008

We present 31 Be-10 cosmic-ray exposure ages (CRE) of boulders collected from three mountain glacier moraines located in the Tasilap valley, in southeastern Greenland, and 10 Be-10 CRE ages from one mountain glacier in the Isortup valley, in southern Greenland. For the first time in these areas, mountain glacier fluctuations are documented from moraine CRE for the Late Holocene period. Several glacier advances during the Late Holocene are revealed with exposure ages ranging from 3.90 +/- 0.26 to 0.4 +/- 0.04 ka. Moraines of three of the four glaciers investigated, dated to 3.75 +/- 0.13 ka (n = 3), 3.3 +/- 0.19 ka (n = 2) and 2.87 +/- 0.13 ka (n = 3), show a common timing of the largest glacier expansion during the Late Holocene. Evidence of at least one individual moraine deposited at similar to 1.2 ka was found on all glaciers. Finally, the most recent period of glacial advance during the Late Holocene is documented by one glacier in each valley at similar to 0.66-0.70 ka. The maximum glacier extent at similar to 3 ka differs from the Late Holocene glacier maximum extent usually reported during the Little Ice Age in east Greenland based on moraine dating and lake sediments. We suggest that the combination of a stronger East Greenland Current and a weaker Irminger Current, potentially associated with increased sea-ice concentration, superimposed on the long-term decrease in summer insolation during the Late Holocene could be responsible for this large glacial advance at similar to 3 ka in southern and southeastern Greenland.

J	Ferreira, LV; Stohlgren, TJ				Ferreira, LV; Stohlgren, TJ			Effects of river level fluctuation on plant species richness, diversity, and distribution in a floodplain forest in Central Amazonia	OECOLOGIA												River levels in Central Amazonia fluctuate up to 14 m annually, with the flooding period ranging from 50 to 270 days between the rising and falling phases. Vast areas of forest along the rivers contain plant species that are well adapted to annual flooding. We studied the effect of flooding level on tree species richness, diversity, density, and composition in lake, river, and stream habitats in Ja ir National Park, Brazil. 3051 trees >10 cm diameter (at 1.3 m diameter at breast height, dbh) were measured and identified in 25 10 m x 40 m randomly selected plots in each habitat. Ordination methods and analysis of variance results sheared that forested areas near lakes had significantly lower species richness of trees than riverine and streamside habitats. Plot. species richness and diversity were strongly negatively correlated with, the water level and duration of flooding. The drier (stream) habitat had more total species (54 species of trees) and more unique species of trees (6 tree species) than the riverine (52 tree species; 3 unique species) and lake (33 tree species; 3 unique species) habitats. Species composition overlap among habitats was surprisingly high (42.6-60.6% overlap), almost one-third of the species were found in all three habitat types, and few species were unique to each habitat. We conclude that: (1) duration of flooding has a strong impact on species richness, diversity and plant distribution patterns; (2) most species are adapted to a wide range of habitats and flood durations; and (3) while flood duration may decrease local diversity, it also creates and maintains high landscape-scale diversity by increasing landscape heterogeneity.																			0029-8549	1432-1939				SEP	1999	120	4					582	587		10.1007/s004420050893	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s004420050893								28308309					WOS:000082858900014

Andrew			Modelling effects of nutrients and hypoxia on Lake Erie's central basin foodweb	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Hypoxia (dissolved oxygen < 2 mg l(-1)) has long been a prevalent feature of the central basin of Lake Erie. Studies of the sublethal impacts of hypoxia on fishes have focused on individual species feeding rates, behavior and spatial distributions over short time periods, but the long-term effects on the fish community and its foodweb are poorly known. Sublethal effects of hypoxia on fish include: interrupting their vertical migration, displacing them from bottom habitats either up into the water column or away from the hypoxic zones, altering predator-prey relationships by segregation or aggregation of predators and their prey, and increasing fishing mortality by concentrating fish at the edge of hypoxic zones. We used the Ecopath with Ecosim foodweb model to investigate the singular and combined effects of nutrient concentration and hypoxia on the foodweb structure in Lake Erie's central basin. Our model tracked predator-prey interactions and population biomass of 33 model groups. We balanced the model in Ecopath and calibrated it against biomass time series data from 1996 up to 2020. Model simulations were run with varied nutrients (from 20 to 220% of the previous nutrient loading target level) and hypoxia (none, average summer value from 1996 to 2017, historical high) as forcing variables on the foodweb. Model results suggested that nutrients had positive, non-linear effects on foodweb biomass, while hypoxia decreased biomass of benthos, benthivorous fishes, and some omnivores, but increased biomass of plankton and planktivorous fishes. Nutrient effects were greater than hypoxia effects on the foodweb. Results of the foodweb model analysis may inform water quality and fisheries management strategies for Lake Erie's central basin.

Fauna of Free-Living Nematodes (Nematoda) of Sandy Beaches of Lake Baikal Splash Zone in Intense and Moderate Anthropogenic Influence Areas	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												The qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the fauna of free-living nematodes in the splash zone of sandy beaches in two regions of southern Baikal (Listvenichny Bay, opposite Nerpinariy, and Bolshie Koty Bay in the Varnachka area) have been studied. The coastal zone and water area of Listvenichny Bay are under intense anthropogenic impact due to the continuous flow of tourists, as opposed to the beach of Bolshie Koty Bay, located 3 km north of the village and visited by fewer people. It is found that the species composition of nematodes of the first beach is poorer than that of the second one (18 and 29 species, respectively). The number of nematodes during the open-water period in the splash zone of the Varnachka gradually increases from June to October 2015 (11.7 times). During the same period, there is no regular growth in the population of the Nerpinariy station; moreover, in August there is a noticeable drop, with the initial (June) level recovered only by October. An analysis of abiotic factors has not revealed any significant reliable changes that explain such a sharp fall in the number of worms. At the same time, the largest anthropogenic load is in August due to the high and almost continuous flow of tourists in the village of Listvyanka.

The Qaidam Basin, located in the north-eastern part of the TP contains an exceptionally thick Meso-Cenozoic sedimentary succession; it is also the largest sedimentary basin in the TP. Here, new data on Pleistocene sediments on the TP are reported. Evidence from GDGTs, stable isotopes as well as major and trace elements of the Pleistocene Qigequan Formation was used to decipher depositional conditions within the water column and the origin of kerogen. This information was further applied to interpret factors controlling organic matter (OM) accumulation and climate conditions. In accordance with a previous study, the results show that two completely different organic facies are present, representing vastly different lake environments. OM of organic facies A samples is mainly derived from a mixture of C3 higher plants and phytoplankton, deposited in a shallow freshwater lake environment under dysoxic to anoxic bottom water conditions. In contrast, OM of organic facies B is mainly derived from a hypersaline and more distal lake environments mainly under oxic conditions. OM accumulation in both organic facies was primarily controlled by the paleo-redox conditions rather than paleo-productivity. By contrast, there is no significant difference between organic facies A and B samples with respect to the paleo-climate proxies. Generally, the sediments were deposited under arid/cold conditions with weak chemical weathering during the Pleistocene. The soils on the Tibetan Plateau tended to be alkaline at this time. Combined with the published data, the Pleistocene indices based on GDGT biomarkers indicate a rather continuous cooling and aridification process from Miocene to present. The Pleistocene Mean Annual Air Temperature based on bGDGTs (0.54-4.91 degrees C, 2.23 degrees C on average) was slightly higher than the present temperature, and the reconstructed lake surface temperature ranges from 5.7 to 19.6 degrees C (in winter 2.4-13.7 degrees C).					; 乔, 锦琪/AAX-3729-2021; Zieger, Laura/ABA-2412-2021; Grohmann, Sebastian/HZH-5063-2023; Littke, Ralf/A-6701-2016	qiao, jin qi/0000-0001-6240-6389; 													0166-5162	1872-7840				APR 1	2022	254								103958	10.1016/j.coal.2022.103958	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.coal.2022.103958		APR 2022											WOS:000805984500003

Environmental conditions in riverine reservoirs are affected by the changing climate, catchment-wide processes and manipulations with the water level, and water abstraction from the reservoir. Long-term trends of environmental conditions in reservoirs thus reflect a wider range of drivers in comparison to lakes, which makes the understanding of reservoir dynamics more challenging. We analysed a 32-year time series of 36 environmental variables characterising weather, land use in the catchment, reservoir hydrochemistry, hydrology and light availability in the small, canyon-shaped Rimov Reservoir in the Czech Republic to detect underlying trends, trend reversals and regime shifts. To do so, we fitted linear and piecewise linear regression and a regime shift model to the time series of mean annual values of each variable and to principal components produced by Principal Component Analysis. Models were weighted and ranked using Akaike information criterion and the model selection approach. Most environmental variables exhibited temporal changes that included time-varying trends and trend reversals. For instance, dissolved organic carbon showed a linear increasing trend while nitrate concentration or conductivity exemplified trend reversal. All trend reversals and cessations of temporal trends in reservoir hydrochemistry (except total phosphorus concentrations) occurred in the late 1980s and during 1990s as a consequence of dramatic socioeconomic changes. After a series of heavy rains in the late 1990s, an administrative decision to increase the flood-retention volume of the reservoir resulted in a significant regime shift in reservoir hydraulic conditions in 1999. Our analyses also highlight the utility of the model selection framework, based on relatively simple extensions of linear regression, to describe temporal trends in reservoir characteristics. This approach can provide a solid basis for a better understanding of processes in freshwater reservoirs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Kim, SK; Choi, JY				Kim, Seong-Ki; Choi, Jong-Yun			Differences in the Vertical Distribution of Two Cladoceran Species in the Nakdong River Estuary, South Korea	WATER												As cladocerans are a primary food source for fish, predator avoidance is important to sustain cladoceran populations. We hypothesized thatBosmina longirostrisandDaphniaobtusawould show different vertical distributions that depend on environmental variables and their life cycle phase. Quarterly monitoring was implemented in three water column layers (upper, middle, and bottom) in the Nakdong River Estuary. Cladocerans were mostly observed during summer;B. longirostrisandD.obtusawere most abundant and exhibited different vertical distributions. Large (>600 mu m)D.obtusaindividuals were mainly distributed in the bottom layer (9-11 m) during the daytime and in the upper layer (1-3 m) at night. Utilization of the bottom layer by largeD. obtusawas possibly a defense strategy to avoid fish predation. Although the bottom layer was not supported by lower water temperatures and dissolved oxygen than the upper or middle layers, as suggested in the previous study, we assumed that high turbidity replaced this role as a place shunned by fish (and thus a refuge forDaphnia obtusa). In contrast, smaller individuals remained in the upper layer at all times because of the low predation risk. The consumption ofB. longirostrisby fish was low, as the largestB. longirostris(411 mu m) was smaller than the small-sizedDaphnia. From this finding, we suggest that the vertical distribution of cladocerans likely depends on selectivity feeding based on fish size rather than the presence/absence of fish. We considered that these results are an important advance in understanding distribution patterns of cladocerans related to environmental features, as well as their key predators.

The Quinault Blowdown: A Microscale Wind Event Driven by a Mountain-Wave Rotor	BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												On 27 January 2018, a highly localized, strong wind event occurred along the north shore of Lake Quinault, Washington. The resulting loss of large old-growth trees in a roughly 0.5-km2 region led to blocked roads and power outages. Nearby surface stations did not record anomalous winds, and no tree damage was reported in the surrounding region. Based on public accounts and a nearby seismometer, it appears that the strong winds lasted less than 10 min. Surface and aerial damage surveys showed that the trees fell from a different direction (northerly) than the synoptic or mesoscale f low (southwesterly to southeasterly). Based on high-resolution Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model simulations, it appears that the damaging northerly winds were the result of a strong atmospheric rotor produced by a high-amplitude mountain wave. A simulation with 148-m grid spacing produced a rotor at the same time and location as the treefalls. Synoptic analysis and the high-resolution simulation showed that moderately strong southeasterly flow and a stable layer associated with the approaching occluded front interacted with a similar to 750-m-high upstream mountain ridge to produce the mountain wave and associated rotor circulation. The combination of an inversion and strong shear at and above the upstream ridge were outliers in a climatology of soundings from the nearby Quillayute rawinsonde site, suggesting that such intense mountain-wave rotors are unusual in this valley.

Transplanting aquatic macrophytes to restore the littoral community of a eutrophic lake after the removal of common carp	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Knopik J, Newman R. 2018. Transplanting aquatic macrophytes to restore the littoral community of a eutrophic lake after the removal of common carp. Lake Reserve Manage. 34:365-375.Six native submersed aquatic macrophyte taxa were transplanted to a eutrophic lake (Lake Susan, Minnesota) to promote the growth and expansion of native taxa after the removal of common carp (Cyprinus carpio). Muskgrass (Chara spp.), wild celery (Vallisneria americana), northern watermilfoil (Myriophyllum sibiricum), bushy pondweed (Najas flexilis), water stargrass (Heteranthera dubia), and flat-stem pondweed (Potamogeton zosteriformis) were transplanted in a series of shallow (0.5-1.0 m) and deep (1.0-1.5 m) experimental plots around the lake. Survival and expansion of plants were measured over 4yr and compared against environmental factors. Transplantation of whole plants in shallow water was generally successful, but plants in depths 1.4 m failed to persist. Light availability was the most important factor determining success. Water stargrass was the most successful, with high long-term survival and substantial expansion. Wild celery had high survival, but slow and limited expansion. Bushy pondweed had variable survival, but when it survived it generally expanded well. Muskgrass and northern watermilfoil had poor survival and expansion. Transplanting whole submersed aquatic macrophytes can help to restore the littoral community in degraded systems, but ecological stressors such as common carp should first be addressed. Poor mid-summer water clarity will limit the depth and distribution of successful transplants and taxa that survive. Taxa with large perennial structures such as water stargrass and wild celery are more likely to establish and persist, but the annual bushy pondweed was also able to grow and spread.

Physical modelling demonstrates that the efficiency of tsunami generation is influenced by the angle the mass enters the ocean. Efficiency decreases with increasing slope angle from 20 degrees to 60 degrees, before increasing to a maximum at 90 degrees, which corresponds to a mass falling directly into the ocean without interacting with the slope (impact tsunami). Further, in the case of surging pyroclastic flows or regressive failures, successive closely spaced events may generate larger tsunami waves than a single event of comparable volume. It is difficult to assess if physical model results are meaningful for real world tsunami events due to limited observational data. Two New Zealand palaeo-events - pyroclastic flows from Mt Tarawera and edifice failure at Whakaari (White Island) - can be linked to tsunami deposits, which constrains numerical simulations of the source mechanisms. The Mt Tarawera event involved multiple pyroclastic flows entering a lake during the AD 1314 +/- 12 Kaharoa Eruption. The interaction of multiple closely spaced pyroclastic flows is necessary to generate the 6-7 m maximum wave height inferred from near source tsunami deposits. Tsunami deposits in the Bay of Plenty, dated to 2962 +/- 52 BP, are consistent with edifice failure at Whakaari. In this case a single event with a volume of 0.23 km(3) is sufficient to account for the tsunami deposits. Hence, if the failure was regressive, the successive stages were sufficiently close together to be indistinguishable from a large single event.					de Lange, Willem/E-9509-2013	Moon, Vicki/0000-0001-7378-8490															978-3-319-20979-1				2016	41						559	567		10.1007/978-3-319-20979-1_56	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-20979-1_56													WOS:000381724100056

Biomarkers in bivalve mollusks and amphipods for assessment of effects linked to cyanobacteria and elodea: Mesocosm study	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												The effects of cyanobacteria (Aphanizomenon flos-aquae (90%), Microcystis aeruginosa) and dense Elodea canadensis beds on the health endpoints of the amphipod Gmelinoides fasciatus and bivalve mollusc Unio pictorum were examined in mesocosms with simulated summer conditions (July-August 2018) in the environment of the Rybinsk Reservoir (Volga River Basin, Russia). Four treatments were conducted, including one control and three treatments with influencing factors, cyanobacteria and dense elodea beds (separately and combined). After 20 days of exposure, we evaluated the frequency of malformed and dead embryos in amphipods, heart rate (HR) and its recovery (HRR) after stress tests in molluscs as well as heat tolerance (critical thermal maximum or CTMax) in both amphipods and molluscs. The significant effect, such as elevated number of malformed embryos, was recorded after exposure with cyanobacteria (separately and combined with elodea) and presence of microcystins (MC) in water (0.17 mu g/l, 40% of the most toxic MC-LR contribution). This study provided evidence that an elevated number (>5% of the total number per female) of malformed embryos in amphipods showed noticeable toxicity effects in the presence of cyanobacteria. The decreased oxygen under the influence of dense elodea beds led to a decrease in HR (and an increase in HRR) in molluscs. The notable effects on all studied biomarkers, embryo malformation frequency and heat tolerance in the amphipod G. fasciatus, as well as the heat tolerance and heart rate in the mollusc U. pictorum, were found when both factors (elodea and cyanobacteria) were combined. The applied endpoints could be further developed for environmental monitoring, but the obtained results support the importance of the combined use of several biomarkers and species, especially in the case of multi-factor environmental stress.					, Verbitskii/AAD-5232-2020; Sharov, Andrey/K-4222-2013; Chernova, Ekaterina/ABA-1598-2020; Berezina, Nadezhda/R-1968-2016; Meteleva, Nina/O-9724-2015	Chernova, Ekaterina/0000-0002-2135-4540; Berezina, Nadezhda/0000-0003-3057-5596; Sharov, Andrey/0000-0001-7581-2538; Meteleva, Nina/0000-0001-8926-3808													0147-6513	1090-2414				OCT 15	2020	203								110994	10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.110994	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.110994								32888603					WOS:000566679000005

During summer bloom seasons, Microcystis is prevalent in many inland waters across the globe. Monitoring concentrations with remote sensing techniques requires knowledge of the inherent optical properties (IOPs), especially the backscattering properties of Microcystis cells and colonies in natural settings. In situ measurements in waters dominated by Microcystis blooms have previously detected extremely high backscattering ratios, i.e., b(b)/b>0.043 at 443 nm [1], the highest to our knowledge in the natural environment. These highb(b)/bvalues could hold promise as a diagnostic tool in identifying and monitoring Microcystis using optical approaches. However, it has been unclear how this type of optically 'soft' organic particle can generate such highb(b)/bvalues. In this study, the Multiple Sphere T-matrix (MSTM) model is used to calculate the IOPs of model colonies, including b(b)/b. Colony sizes in the model ranged from several cells to several hundred and both colony packing density and cell gas vacuole content were varied. Results are compared with model results for equivalent-volume spheres (EVS) and direct in situ measurements. Colony formation was required in the modeling to reproduce the high b(b)/bconsistent with in situ measurements. The combination of moderate to very dense colony (packing density >30%) and high gas vacuole content in individual cells (volume percentage >20%) was the most favorable condition leading to rapid increases in bb/bwith increasing number of cells Ar c a of the colony. Significant linear correlations were observed betweenb(b)/b and N-cell(1/3) for these colonies, whereb(b)/b increased beyond 0.04 once cell number reached about 1000 cells in the case with the most densely packed cells and highest gas vacuole content. Within commonly observed colony sizes (N-cell <10(6)), colonies with high gas vacuole content exhibited bb/bvalues up to 0.055, consistent with direct measurements from Lake Erie. Polarized scattering was also of interest as a diagnostic tool, particularly with future Earth-orbiting polarimeters being deployed for the NASA Plankton, Aerosols, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) mission. The Degree of Linear Polarization (DoLP), expressed by the ratio of two Mueller matrix elements-P12/P11, decreased with increasing colony cell number for Microcystis. Another ratio of two Mueller matrix elementsP(22)/P-11, an index for nonsphericity, also decreased with increasing colony size. In addition to higher relative backscattering, greater colony packing density and larger gas vacuole sizes both led to lower DoLP peak magnitude and lowerP(22)/P-11. An optical opposition feature due to constructive phase interference that was observed previously for cosmic dusts is also present for these modeled colonies, manifested by a narrow intensity peak and negative polarization dip near exact backscattering direction, gradually forming as colony size increases.

Core samples from different locations in the lake were collected and analysed for Pb-210 and Cs-137. From the analysis it appears that the lake is not reducing: in depth at a rate reported by earlier investigations. Recent sedimentation rate, estimated by the Pb-210 dating technique, has been found to be fairly constant at one location (the mean dry mass sedimentation rate being 0.112 +/- 0.010 g cm(-2) a(-1)) but varying at other locations in the lake (the dry mass sedimentation rates ranging from 0.026 +/- 0.010 to 0.421 +/- 0.050 g cm(-2) a(-1)). At all locations the short-term rates (for the last three decades) derived from Cs-137, a fall-out nuclide, have been observed to be marginally higher compared to long-term (last 120-150 yr) rates deduced from Pb-210. The spatial and depthwise distribution of Cs-137 and Pb-210 and spatial variation of surface Pb-210/Cs-137 in the obtained sediment cores of the lake, along with their textural properties (like porosity and water content), provide preliminary information on the existence of different depositional zones throughout the lake and on the physico-chemical nature of the sedimentation process in the lake (i.e., bioturbation, slumping, sediment focusing, land erosion/land slide etc).

This study focuses on Danjiangkou Reservoir, a canyon lake in central China, that acts as the water source of the Mid-route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project.MethodsIn this study, high-throughput 18S rDNA gene sequencing was employed to investigate eukaryotic plankton community at four water depths (0.5 m, 5 m, 10 m, and 20 m). The environmental factors including pH, water temperature (WT), nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N), ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N), total nitrogen (TN), conductivity (Cond), and dissolved oxygen (DO) in reservoir areas were measured, and their correlations with abundance and diversity of eukaryotic plankton were analyzed.ResultsThe results showed the presence of 122 genera of eukaryotic plankton from 38 phyla. Eukaryotic plankton communities were mainly composed of Eurytemora, Thermocyclops, Sinocalanus, Mesocyclops, and Cryptomonas. In particular, significant differences in the diversity of eukaryotic plankton communities were found in vertical distribution. The diversity and abundance of eukaryotic plankton communities in 7 sampling sites decreased with the increase of depth from 0.5 to 10 m, while the diversity and abundance of plankton communities increased at 20 m. RDA analysis indicated that pH, depth, WT, NH4+-N, DO, Cond, and NO3--N could influence the vertical distribution of the eukaryotic plankton community in the Danjiangkou Reservoir. Among these eukaryotic plankton, Eurytemora, Thermocyclops, and Volvox were negatively correlated with pH and WT and positively correlated with depth.DiscussionThis study revealed a novel perspective on the distribution of the eukaryotic plankton community in Danjiangkou Reservoir, particularly in terms of vertical variation, which will be helpful to comprehensively understand ecological processes and to further ensure the water quality safety in this canyon-style reservoir.

J	Huntley, DH; Bobrowsky, PT; Clague, JJ				Huntley, DH; Bobrowsky, PT; Clague, JJ			Ocean Drilling Program Leg 169S: surficial geology, stratigraphy and geomorphology of the Saanich Inlet area, southeastern Vancouver Island, British Columbia	MARINE GEOLOGY												This paper provides: (i) a descriptive overview of the late Pleistocene and Holocene geology and geomorphology of the region surrounding Saanich Inlet; and (ii) the palaeogeographic setting for discussion of the oceanographic record at ODP leg 169S sites 1033 and 1034. The dominant deposits and landforms in the Saanich Inlet area are similar to those of late Pleistocene marine-influenced glacial environments and modem fjord inlets dominated by retreating tide-water glaciers. Patterns of ice retreat, meltwater drainage and sea-level change are reconstructed for the interval 4000-15 000 calendar years before present (yrBP). The flux of meltwater and sediment into Saanich Inlet was greatest between ca. 12 000 and 15 000 yrBP. At that time, sea level was up to 90 m higher relative to land than today. During deglaciation, tidewater glaciers occupying Chemainus, Cowichan and Koksilah valleys entered a marine embayment that formed in the vicinity of Cowichan Bay, Satellite Channel, Saanich Met and Saanich Peninsula. In the early Holocene, relative sea level fell to a low stand perhaps tens of metres below the present datum, and the surface area of Saanich Inlet and Satellite Channel was much reduced. By the middle Holocene, sea level had risen to near its present position, and modem drainage patterns and oceanographic conditions were established. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Weyl, OLF; Hecht, T				Weyl, OLF; Hecht, T			A successful population of largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides, in a subtropical lake in Mozambique	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Sectioned otoliths were used for age and growth determination of the alien Micropterus salmoides from Lake Chicamba, a hydroelectric dam in central Mozambique. Marginal zone analysis showed that annulus formation occurred during winter in August and September. The maximum estimated age was 5 years. Growth was described by the 3 parameter von Bertalanffy model as L-t = 465.51 (1-e(-1.175(t+0.009))) mm FL. Juvenile growth rate was 23.1 mm per month during their first 7 months of life. The age at 100% maturity was 0.9 years, and spawning occurred during August and September. The juvenile fish fed sequentially on the most abundant prey items. Spawning occured before any of the indigenous fish species and so, there is little inter-specific competition. Conspecific juveniles formed the most important constituent in the adult M. salmoides diet from October to December when alternative prey was limited. The total annual mortality rate (Z) for the species in Lake Chicamba was 1.27 yr(-1), the mean empirical estimate of natural mortality (M) was 0.73 yr(-1), and fishing mortality (F) was calculated at 0.54 yr(-1). The success of M. salmoides in Lake Chicamba was attributed to limited inter-specific and intra-specific competition for prey as a consequence of the timing of the spawning, cannibalism and high mortality rates.

J	Degans, H; De Meester, L				Degans, H; De Meester, L			Top-down control of natural phyto- and bacterioplankton prey communities by Daphnia magna and by the natural zooplankton community of the hypertrophic Lake Blankaart	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Biomanipulation, through the reduction of fish abundance resulting in an increase of large filter feeders and a stronger top-down control on algae, is commonly used as a lake restoration tool in eutrophic lakes. However, cyanobacteria, often found in eutrophic ponds, can influence the grazing capacity of filter feeding zooplankton. We performed grazing experiments in hypertrophic Lake Blankaart during two consecutive summers (1998, with and 1999, without cyanobacteria) to elucidate the influence of cyanobacteria on the grazing pressure of zooplankton communities. We compared the grazing pressure of the natural macrozooplankton community (mainly small to medium-sized cladocerans and copepods) with that of large Daphnia magna on the natural bacterioplankton and phytoplankton prey communities. Our results showed that in the absence of cyanobacteria, Daphnia magna grazing pressure on bacteria was higher compared to the grazing pressure of the natural zooplankton community. However, Daphnia grazing rates on phytoplankton were not significantly different compared to the grazing rates of the natural zooplankton community. When cyanobacteria were abundant, grazing pressure of Daphnia magna seemed to be inhibited, and the grazing pressure on bacteria and phytoplankton was similar to that of the natural macrozooplankton community. Our results suggest that biomanipulation may not always result in a more effective top-down control of the algal biomass.

The two sites fall in the semi-humid to semi-arid climate transition zone, Dali Nor area of the southeast Inner Mongolia Plateau, China. Complemented by data for loss-on-ignition (LOI), total organic carbon (TOC), carbon/nitrogen (C/N), grain-size, and pollen, these mineral-magnetic measurements provide additional insights into environmental changes occurring at this area over the last 13 500 years. Conditions were extremely dry and windy as shown by the low SIRM, ARM and HIRM and high S-ratios before 13 500 yr BP. The environment began to ameliorate gradually since then, and a further humidification occurred at similar to 10300 yr BP in Haoluku, the northern site, and at similar to 9400 yr sp in Liuzhouwan, the southern one, as implied by the increased but only moderately high SIRM, ARM and HIRM and decreased S-ratios. As indicated by the remarkably increased SIRM, ARM, HIRM and S-ratios, a deterioration commenced at similar to 5600 yr sp in Haoluku and at similar to 4700 yr BP in Liuzhouwan. In Haoluku, conditions have been generally dry and windy since similar to 5600 yr BP despite a minor amelioration at 4500-3000 yr BP. A short but marked amelioration occurred at 1200-700 yr up in Liuzhouwan. S-ratios seem to be a reliable indicator of environmental aridity for this area. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Cities often implement TDM programs by intervening with new development during the municipal permit review process. Seattle's Transportation Management Program (TMP) under a joint Director's Rule (DR) requires a commitment from developers to adopt select strategies from six TDM element categories: program management, physical improvements, bicycle/walking programs, employer-based incentives, transit and car/vanpooling, and parking management. TMP targets new developments and requires some TDM elements, recommends others, and leaves the rest to negotiation. The result is an individualized TMP agreement that is site-specific, reflecting both city policy and developer needs. This case study presents a qualitative analysis of the guiding eight DRs and 41 site-specific TMP agreements in Seattle's Downtown and South Lake Union (SLU) area since 1988. Overall, a content analysis of TMP documents reveals that the average number of elements adopted in an agreement falls short of requirements set by DRs (34%-61%). Major findings include developer preference toward non-traditional TDM measures such as physical improvement of frontage and urban design features, as well as parking management. High-occupancy vehicle (HOV) elements showed higher adoption rates (59%-63%) over biking/walking programs (< 1%). It is concluded that future TDM policies could benefit if future research includes examining the effectiveness of the range of management options stemming from the real estate trends toward green buildings, tenants' values in sustainability, and city policy to reduce automobile trips.

Total catch of fish per net (CPUE) in multi-mesh gillnets placed in the open water and the littoral zones was positively related with the nutrient level. Trout CPUE was negatively correlated with total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN). Zooplankton seemed largely influenced by fish, as high fish CPUE coincided with low zooplankton and Daphnia biomass, low average weight of cladocerans, low contribution of Daphnia to total cladoceran biomass, low ratio of calanoids to total copepod biomass and low ratio of zooplankton biomass to phytoplankton biomass. However, chlorophyll a was only slightly negatively related to Daphnia biomass and not to zooplankton biomass in a multiple regression that included TN and TP. Ciliate abundance was positively related to chlorophyll a and negatively to Daphnia biomass, but not to total zooplankton biomass, while no relationships were found between heterotrophic nanoflagellates and zooplankton. The relationships between fish abundance and nutrients and fish abundance and zooplankton:phytoplankton ratio and between chlorophyll a and TP largely followed the pattern obtained for 42 north temperate Danish lakes. We conclude that fish, including trout, have a major effect on the zooplankton community structure and biomass in the pelagial of the shallow oligotrophic to slightly eutrophic New Zealand lakes, but that the cascading effects on phytoplankton and protist are apparently modest.

J	Whall, JD; Lasenby, DC				Whall, John D.; Lasenby, David C.			Differences in the trophic role of Mysis diluviana in two intermontane lakes	AQUATIC BIOLOGY												The trophic role of the freshwater shrimp Mysis diluviana was compared between 2 neighbouring lakes in British Columbia to investigate its possible role in the collapse of the Okanagan Lake kokanee salmon Oncorhynchus nerka population. Stable isotopes of nitrogen (delta N-15) and carbon (delta C-13) were used to compare the trophic relationships of mysids within the pelagic food web and between lakes. Mid-summer delta N-15 signatures suggested that adult mysids in Okanagan Lake were acting more as primary consumers, and Kalamalka Lake mysids were acting as secondary consumers. M diluviana's predatory capacity was also assessed through in situ clearance rate feeding experiments and examination of gut contents. M diluviana < 1 yr old in Okanagan Lake were capable of clearing a greater volume of prey, but there was no difference between lakes for M diluviana > 1 yr old. Gut contents confirmed M diluviana in both lakes were consuming copepod and cladoceran prey. All 3 techniques demonstrated ontogenetic diet shifts, with larger mysids obtaining more energy from zooplankton prey. Although mysids in feeding experiments actively consumed the same zooplankton prey as kokanee, delta N-15 and delta C-13 ratios suggest that mysids in Okanagan Lake were not feeding at the same trophic level as kokanee, which indicates that there may have been less competition for food sources than previously thought. These differences in results suggest that predatory capacity, as indicated by in situ feeding experiments or gut content analysis, should not be used in isolation to establish trophic roles for omnivorous animals.																			1864-7790	1864-7782					2009	5	3					281	292		10.3354/ab00162	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ab00162													WOS:000267411800007

Integrated analyses of sedimentological, seismic geomorphological, palaeohydraulic, palynological and element-geochemical data reveal the influence of palaeoclimate on the morphology and depositional processes of distributary networks in shoal-water deltaic strata. Two contrasting palaeoclimatic stages were identified based on palynological and geochemical evidence, namely the earlier warm and humid climatic stage, and the later arid climatic stage. Compared with the earlier humid stage, the arid stage features much more abundant xerophytic species (Labiatae and Ephedra) as well as much higher Mg/Ca, Sr/Ba, and Th/U ratios and B content, indicating extensive evaporation. A third-order sequence stratigraphic unit was recognized, consisting of a transgressive systems tract with landward stepping parasequence sets, a poorly developed highstand systems tract, and a falling stage systems tract with basinward stepping parasequence sets, which were products of the humid and arid climatic stages, respectively. A series of distributary channel complexes exhibiting reticular patterns was identified in the strata corresponding to the humid climatic stage, with amalgamated, multi-storey distributary channel sandbodies showing a sinuosity range of 1.1 to 1.3. In contrast, the strata corresponding to the arid climatic stage are dominantly composed of distributary channel systems exhibiting dendritic forms, with prevalent single-storey channel fills and a low sinuosity range of 1.0 to 1.2. The dendritic system is more stable than the reticular counterpart due to the effects of frequent incision and limited vertical aggradation. Typical modern shoal-water deltas formed in different climatic conditions (i.e. Poyang Lake delta and Neales River delta) serve as analogues to the proposed conceptual depositional models of distributary networks related to palaeoclimate.

Therefore, 16 borehole cores were analysed with the following aims: (1) to define a chronological framework; (2) to obtain data on the palaeoenvironment; and (3) to establish the relationship with human activities, especially focused on the reconstruction of the Carthago Nova (also known as Qart Hadasht) conquest. A total of 147 samples were recovered for amino acid racemisation (AAR) dating; 32 for radiocarbon dating (C-14); and 159 for sedimentological, palaeontological, and biomarker determination. These approaches allowed us to elucidate the evolutionary phases of the palaeolandscape in Cartagena. The simultaneous use of AAR and C-14 dating allowed the discrimination of spurious ages and the establishment of a chronological scale. During the Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 7 and 5, the sea level (SL) in Cartagena Bay was almost the same as today. An alluvial plain developed in the northern area, and a delta was formed by an ephemeral river. In contrast, during MIS4, after a fall in SL, a wide sandy coastal plain emerged, leading to the accumulation of colluvial and aeolian deposits. The Holocene transgression was reflected in the hinterland in a late and temporarily floodable marsh fed by alluvial fans and creeks, producing a salinity gradient from freshwater to brackish and saline waters. Along the sea front, the marine influence was evident but not dominant, grading up and landwards to saline and freshwater marshes. Therefore, at the time of Scipio's conquest, the geography of Carthago Nova was quite different from that described by Polybius. The Roman's sudden attack seized Qart Hadasht from the south-west, avoiding the marshy area and not crossing a fast and deep ebb stream as it never existed on the Mediterranean Iberian coast.

J	Lin, LK; Lee, H; Slaymaker, C				Lin, LK; Lee, H; Slaymaker, C			Development of a portable expert system for rehabilitation inspection in Salt Lake City	CIVIL ENGINEERING SYSTEMS												In the spring of 1993, the Utah Special Improvement District project was initiated to improve sidewalks, curb and gutters, and driveway approaches (aprons) in Salt Lake City. One of the critical problems Faced during this project was how to recommend the most appropriate treatment decision at the roadway improvement job sites. Therefore, the research was conducted to demonstrate the use of an expert system on a portable computer at the construction job site. A prototype Portable Inspection Expert System (PIES) was developed based on the following factors: displacement, surface condition, water effect, tree root effect, and condition of adjacent sections. PIES can decide if replacement, jacking, or do nothing treatment of concrete sections is required. PIES program was developed by using ''KnowledgePro Windows'' expert system shell, and installed in ''Dauphin DTR-1'' pen-based portable computer. One of the major benefits of using an expert system on a portable computer is that it can combine the necessary information on the distress condition of the facilities and help the inspectors make appropriate decision at construction job sites. PIES had been rested with two engineers and a follow-up survey was conducted after the test. Feedback from the survey was analyzed to improve limitations. The current inspection process for the Utah Special Improvement District project was improved by using a consistent decision rule of PIES.

The atmospheric potential of biogenic volatile organic compounds from needles of white pine (Pinus strobus) in Northern Michigan	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												The key role that biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) play in atmospheric chemistry requires a detailed understanding of how BVOC concentrations will be affected by environmental change. Large-scale screening of BVOC emissions from whole forest ecosystems is difficult with enclosure methods. Leaf composition of BVOC, as a surrogate for direct emissions, can more easily reflect the distribution of BVOC compounds in a forest. In this study, BVOC composition in needles of 92 white pine trees (Pinus strobus), which are becoming a large part of Midwest forests, are tracked for three summers at the University of Michigan Biological Station (UMBS). alpha-Pinene, the dominant terpene in all samples, accounts for 30-50% of all terpenes on a mole basis. The most abundant sesquiterpenoid was a C15 alcohol identified as germacrene D-4-ol. The relationship between limonene and total other monoterpenes shows two distinct trends in the population of these forests. About 14% (n = 13) of the trees showed high levels of limonene (up to 36% of the total BVOC) in the same trees every year. Assuming that needle concentrations scale with emission rate, we estimate that hydroxyl radical reactivity due to reaction with monoterpenes from white pine increases approximately 6% at UMBS when these elevated concentrations are included. We suggest that chemotypic variation within forests has the potential to affect atmospheric chemistry and that large-scale screening of BVOC can be used to study the importance of BVOC variation.																			1680-7316	1680-7324					2012	12	4					2245	2252		10.5194/acp-12-2245-2012	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/acp-12-2245-2012													WOS:000300875900034
J	Riis, T; Christoffersen, KS; Baattrup-Pedersen, A				Riis, Tenna; Christoffersen, Kirsten S.; Baattrup-Pedersen, Annette			Effects of warming on annual production and nutrient-use efficiency of aquatic mosses in a high Arctic lake	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Primary production in Arctic and Antarctic lakes is typically dominated by benthic photosynthetic organisms. These include aquatic mosses that can be very abundant although they must be able to tolerate extreme seasonal climatic variation in irradiance and temperature. Climate change is expected to cause increased nutrient run-off and to prolong ice and snow cover on Arctic lakes. 2. Despite the substantial role that aquatic mosses play in Arctic and Antarctic lakes, our study is the first of its kind to study the in situ growth and nutrient-use efficiency of an Arctic aquatic moss, Drepanocladus trifarius, and how the net production of this species is coupled with a range of climatic factors undergoing change. Here, we verify the use of growth segments as a technique to record historic growth. We then used the method to reconstruct the growth of D. trifarius by comparing in situ measured growth with that determined from growth segments after one year's growth in a high Arctic lake. Finally, we determined nutrient-use efficiency, resorption efficiency and resorption proficiency by measuring the tissue nutrient content in different annual growth segments. 3. The observed annual mean production of D. trifarius was about 2-3 mg DW shoot(-1) year(-1) expressed as biomass increase and 10-30 mm shoot(-1) year(-1) expressed as length increase, while the age of most shoots was 7-10 years. About 90% of the variation in annual net production was explained by between-year variability in snow prolongation and net radiation in June. 4. The low tissue-N (1.05%DW) and tissue-P (0.081%DW) contents found in D. trifarius suggest that its growth in Lake Sommerfugleso is limited by the availability of N and P during summer when the availability of light is sufficient for extensive growth of this species. P resorption was 43% in D. trifarius, whereas no N resorption was recorded, and P proficiency ranged between 0.02 and 0.04% DW, which is comparable to the concentrations measured in other plant types under P limitation, suggesting that P resorption is an advantageous trait for the existence of moss in this oligotrophic environment. 5. Our results suggest that predicted prolongation of snow cover and consequent decrease in net radiation in lakes will decrease annual net primary production. Our results also suggest that species able to exploit elevated nutrient contents have an advantage in more nutrient-rich lakes in future and indicate that dominance patterns may change. We therefore foresee that climate change will have dramatic effects on the annual net production of mosses and thus whole lake primary production in Lake Sommerfugleso and similar lake types dominated by mosses in the high Arctic.					; Baattrup-Pedersen, Annette/J-3285-2013; Riis, Tenna/AAE-4115-2020; Christoffersen, Kirsten Seestern/K-8423-2014; Baattrup-Pedersen, Annette/AAZ-9968-2020	Riis, Tenna/0000-0003-2501-4444; Baattrup-Pedersen, Annette/0000-0002-3118-344X; Christoffersen, Kirsten Seestern/0000-0002-3324-1017; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				AUG	2014	59	8					1622	1632		10.1111/fwb.12368	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12368													WOS:000339385100005

Assessing Potential Stock Structure of Adult Coho Salmon in a Small Alaska Watershed: Quantifying Run Timing, Spawning Locations, and Holding Areas with Radiotelemetry	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Run timing and spatial locations of spawning habitats are often used to identify stocks for conservation planning or management of salmonid fishes. Although complex stock structure is most common within large watersheds with diverse habitats, even small drainages can produce multiple co-occurring spatially or temporally isolated populations or "stocks." This project sought to address the potential existence of stock structure of Coho Salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch in a small coastal watershed on Kodiak, Alaska that supports vital subsistence and recreational fisheries and is currently managed as a single stock. We radio-tagged a total of 348 adult Coho Salmon upon freshwater entry into the Buskin River across three spawning seasons (2015-2017) and tracked in-river movements to the final locations where mortality signals were recorded. We identified two primary spawning habitats within the system: main-stem and lake tributaries, with 54% (range of 47% to 61%) of tagged fish with determined fates tracked to main-stem river spawning areas and 46% (range 39% to 53%) presumably spawning in small tributaries of the 1-km(2) Buskin Lake at the headwater of the watershed. Despite distinct spatial differences in spawning locations, main-stem and tributary spawners did not differ in migration timing into freshwater (difference in run timing of main-stem versus tributary spawners = 1 d) nor body size (main-stem mean body length, mideye to tail fork = 625 mm, tributary mean = 613 mm). Unexpectedly, we determined nearly 70% of all Coho Salmon spent at least some time in Buskin Lake, including 54% of main-stem spawners, suggesting a potential role of Buskin Lake as an important staging habitat for premature migrating adult Coho Salmon who enter freshwater in advance of final maturation. We also identified areas consistently used for holding prior to spawning that could be used in spatial management planning and during times of necessary conservation to ensure integrity of the stock for the future.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				OCT	2021	41	5					1423	1435		10.1002/nafm.10658	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.10658		AUG 2021											WOS:000683019900001

R.; Saeedi, Mohsen; Amirnejad, Reza			Historical changes of heavy metals content and sequential extraction in a sediment core from the Gorgan Bay, Southeastern Caspian Sea	INDIAN JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCES												In the present investigation sedimentation rate, contents of heavy metals (Zn, Co and Ni), enrichment factors and speciation of Zn, Co and Ni of a sediment core from Gorgan Bay have been studied. Sedimentation rate in the study area has given an ample opportunity to track contents of Zn. Co and Ni with different sedimentary phases for the past 500 years (1500 to 2002). Sedimentation rate of 1.4 mm/yr was obtained based on (210)Pb activity study of sediment core. A very low content of A) and Fe in the core compared to those of the mean crust was observed. Heavy metal contents increase towards the top of the sediment core. Chemical partitioning studies revealed that percentiles and amounts of Zn, Ni and Co in non-lithogenous phases increase slightly towards the top of the core sediment sample. There seems to be a slight increasing trend ill pollution level of the sediments of the study area over the last 70 years. Further, despite many research reports, application of Enrichment Factors (EFs) for determination of origin of heavy metals in sediments and pollution detection may lead to incorrect results due to naturally lower concentration of Al than the mean crust and/or higher contents of heavy metals in sediments than those in the crust, as the EFs in the present investigation were high even in 17th century when there were no significant Sources of pollution. The results of Igeo values, oil the other hand, show that minor elements fall within non-polluted classification which can obviously show the error of the enrichment factor calculations with the use of Al as earth reference element.

Joint VSWIR-TIR retrievals of earth's surface and atmosphere	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Remote spectroscopy of terrestrial ecosystems generally falls into one of two categories: UV, Visible and Short Wave InfraRed (VSWIR) methods measuring reflected solar illumination, and Thermal InfraRed (TIR) methods measuring radiation emitted from the Earth's surface. Both interpret the measured radiance with inversion algorithms that estimate surface reflectance, emissivity, surface temperatures, and the atmospheric state. However, the two regimes have traditionally used independent inversion methods. Here we present the first simultaneous inversion of the upwelling radiance spectrum from the UV through the VSWIR and the Thermal Infrared. Maximum A Posteriori estimation determines the surface and atmosphere state that is most consistent with measured radiance across the entire range. We find that the complementary information in the two intervals improves estimates of atmospheric properties, surface emissivity, and surface temperature. Posterior uncertainty is 40% lower in surface temperature and 60% in air temperature. Spurious correlations between atmospheric and surface state are also reduced, with 90% lower correlated uncertainty between total column water vapor and both surface and air temperature. Temperature-emissivity separation also improves, with a 33% reduction in correlated posterior uncertainty between the parameters. We demonstrate the method on coincident data from the Classic Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-C) operating in the VSWIR range, and the Hyperspectral Thermal Emission Spectrometer (HyTES) in the TIR range, during flights on NASA's high-altitude ER-2 aircraft. Measurements spanning 0.4 to 12 microns can improve estimates of surface and atmospheric properties, significantly advancing studies in terrestrial ecosystems, geology, agriculture, and urban management.					; Brodrick, Philip/B-4496-2015; Cawse-Nicholson, Kerry/AAJ-1959-2020; Herman, Robert/AAK-1986-2020; Thompson, David/HJY-8387-2023; Miller, Charles/G-7854-2017; Hook, Simon/D-5920-2016	Herman, Robert/0000-0001-7063-6424; Brodrick, Philip/0000-0001-9497-7661; Green, Joseph/0009-0001-5204-9979; Thompson, David R./0000-0003-1100-7550; Fahlen, Jay/0000-0002-1660-8104; Hook, Simon/0000-0002-0953-6165													0034-4257	1879-0704				DEC 15	2021	267								112727	10.1016/j.rse.2021.112727	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2021.112727		OCT 2021											WOS:000714462800007

Environmental associations with gene transcription in Babine Lake rainbow trout: evidence for local adaptation	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												The molecular genetic mechanisms facilitating local adaptation in salmonids continue to be poorly characterized. Gene transcription is a highly regulated step in the expression of a phenotype and it has been shown to respond to selection and thus may be one mechanism that facilitates the development of local adaptation. Advances in molecular genetic tools and an increased understanding of the functional roles of specific genes allow us to test hypotheses concerning the role of variable environments in shaping transcription at known-function candidate loci. To address these hypotheses, wild rainbow trout were collected in their first summer and subjected to metabolic and immune challenges. We assayed gene transcription at candidate loci that play a role in the molecular genetic response to these stresses, and correlated transcription with temperature data from the streams and the abundance and diversity of bacteria as characterized by massively parallel pyrosequencing. Patterns of transcriptional regulation from resting to induced levels varied among populations for both treatments. Co-inertia analysis demonstrated significant associations between resting levels of metabolic gene transcription and thermal regime (R2=0.19, P=0.013) as well as in response to challenge (R2=0.39, P=0.001) and resting state and challenged levels of cytokine gene transcription with relative abundances of bacteria (resting: R2=0.25, P=0.009, challenged: R2=0.65, P=0.001). These results show that variable environments, even within a small geographic range (<250km), can drive divergent selection among populations for transcription of genes related to surviving stress.					; Wellband, Kyle/AAC-7354-2020	Wellband, Kyle/0000-0002-5183-4510; 													2045-7758					MAY	2013	3	5					1194	1208		10.1002/ece3.531	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.531								23762507					WOS:000318802500006

Hydrostatic rectal injury is a rare presentation of passengers thrown off a PWC. The perforation of the rectum is owing to the excessive hydrostatic force of water exerted through the anal canal. We present the first case of rectosigmoid perforation secondary to PWC hydrostatic injury in Canada. A 14-year-old female passenger presented to the pediatric trauma center with severe abdominal pain and blood per rectum following a fall off the back of a PWC at a local lake. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated a laceration in the anterolateral rectal wall at the rectosigmoid junction with associated free intra-peritoneal air and profuse free fluid. At exploratory laparotomy, a full thickness perforation was identified at the rectosigmoid junction. The rectum was oversewn as a Hartman pouch, and a proximal end colostomy was performed to divert the fecal stream. Management of traumatic pediatric rectal injuries involves detailed perineal examination with proctoscopy, and if warranted, exploratory laparotomy. Despite the rare occurrence of hydrostatic rectal perforations in Canada, it is a serious and potentially devastating injury. In the United States, the National Transportation Safety Board recommends wet suit bottoms for all pediatric PWC operators and passengers. In Canada, similar recommendations have not been made. The use of PWC in Canada is less common than in the US. However, it is steadily increasing, especially on local lakes. Education regarding potential injuries and prevention is recommended.

Monthly, from 1985 to 1990, research was performed on seven sampling sites, Simultaneously with the analysis of periphyton, the morphometric measurements of the crystalline calcite precipitation have been done. The connection between carbonate deposition and periphyton was tested by exposure experiments (microscope slides). Glass slides were submerged in stream water and exposed for 30, 60, and 90 days. Seven locations with different intensity of natural tufa travertine deposition were chosen along Plitvice Lakes. Simultaneously, water temperature, current velocity, the concentration of H+ ion, the degree of water saturation with CaCO3 and the concentration of dissolved organic matter were monitored. Growth of periphyton was analysed, and 191 species were determined with Bacillariophyceae (139) as a dominant group. The dominance of diatom species was observed in all locations (especially in winter) regardless of diversity of the physical and chemical properties of water and the intensity of CaCO3 precipitation.

J	SHERMAN, CK; MORTON, ML				SHERMAN, CK; MORTON, ML			POPULATION DECLINES OF YOSEMITE TOADS IN THE EASTERN SIERRA-NEVADA OF CALIFORNIA	JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY												This paper documents changes in the size of a breeding population of Yosemite toads, Bufo canorus, over 20 years at Tioga Pass, California. Surveys of & canorus numbers in breeding aggregations were made yearly from 1971 to 1982, and less systematic observations were made from 1983 to 1991. Six other populations in the eastern Sierra Nevada were surveyed occasionally from 1973 to 1990. The total number of marked males entering the largest breeding pools at Tioga Pass declined nine-fold from 1974 to 1982. The mean number of toads found in daily searches during breeding also dropped over the 20 year study. Similar declines occurred at smaller breeding sites throughout Tioga Pass Meadow and at the six other populations. In 1990 we found evidence for continued reproduction by B. canorus at all but one location (Sylvester Meadow), although reproduction was minimal at Tioga Pass. No single source of mortality was responsible for all the declines. We interpret the decline in our study populations as caused primarily by drought, disease, and predation. Spring snow depths in 1976,1977 and 1987-1991 were below the 62 year average, resulting in low tadpole survival. The death of adults from disease at Tioga Pass, and from predation at another site (Mildred Lake) also contributed to the declines. Although habitat destruction and localized human activities were not major factors, some natural variables responsible for the declines may have had anthropogenic components.																			0022-1511					JUN	1993	27	2					186	198		10.2307/1564935	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1564935													WOS:A1993MB99600010

Data from samples associated with a new cave survey and hydrologic studies indicate that past water tables within Wind Cave reached a maximum height of 45 m above modern levels but were mostly confined to 25 m or less. Uranium-series ages for basal layers deposited on weathered wall rock indicate subaerial conditions in this part of the cave persisted between 1000 and 300 ka. Ages and elevations of wall coatings and cave rafts establish a 300,000 yr paleohydrograph indicating that water-table highstands occurred during interglacial or interstadial-to-early glacial periods and lowstands occurred during full-glacial and stadial episodes. Isotopes of Sr, U, C, and O from dated calcite samples were obtained to evaluate potential shifts in paleo-groundwater composition. For comparison, Sr and U isotopic compositions were determined for modern groundwater from 18 sites previously classified into five hydrogeologic domains. Isotope data for different domains tend to cluster in separate fields, although several fields overlap. Compositions of Calcite Lake (informal name) water reflect modern recharge to shallow aquifers. In contrast, speleothem data indicate that paleo-groundwater highstands were not supported by increased infiltration associated with local recharge, or by upwelling from deeper Proterozoic sources. Instead, cave water was similar to deeper, warmer groundwater from the Madison Aquifer discharging at modern artesian springs flanking the southern Black Hills. Highstands were likely influenced by large-scale hydraulic processes associated with recharge to the Madison Aquifer under the Laurentide ice sheet on the northeast side of the Williston Basin, causing increased hydrostatic pressures in confined aquifers on the south side of the basin.

Diachronic studies on isotope records from single archaeological sites may help distinguish palaeoclimatic changes from human choices in agricultural practices, but they are actually missing. We have analysed C-13 isotope discrimination (Delta C-13) and N isotope composition (delta N-15) on barley, emmer and wheat C-14-AMS dated grains from the archaeological site of Arslantepe, Malatya (South-Eastern Turkey). Our intent is to focus on the exceptionally long-term development of agricultural practices at the site from 4300 to 2000 BC. Stable isotope values of cereals show temporal trends in water supplies and manure application. Irrigation was provided to barley crops from 4300 to 3100 BC during the rise of centralised political organisation at the site. Different locations of barley fields are suggested from 3100 to 2000 BC when domestic economies are attested. In addition, the marked increase of barley delta N-15 values from 3350 to 3000 BC reveals manuring and/or cultivation in pasturelands due to the deposition of animal urea and dung. Wheat could have been grown close to the site, where irrigation water from natural springs was available. Emmer and wheat seem to have been cultivated in the same areas or directly in the same fields. During 3000-2500 BC intercropping cultivation is inferred by low delta N-15 values. The evidence of mixture crops confirms the increase of pasturelands during herders' occupations and the concentration of crop fields possibly around the site. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Kutz. commonly occurs as single cells at early recruitment but forms large colonies in summer. Colony formation will induce many acclimative changes. In this study, we demonstrated the photochemical changes before and after colony formation. In the laboratory, light curves showed that colonies were more responsive to high light than single cells. The values of the maximal slope of electron transport rate (ETR)-light curve (alpha), relative maximal electron transport rate (rETR(max)), and onset of light saturation (I-k) of colonies were significantly higher than those of single cells (P < 0.05), indicating that colonies have higher photosynthetic capability than single cells, especially in high light, where values of rETR(max) and I-k of colonies were 2.32 and 2.41 times those of single cells. Moreover, the dark-lig ht experiments showed that colonial cells can more effectively resist darkness damage. In addition, pigments of colonial cells were higher than those of single cells (P < 0.05). The higher pigment contents probably contribute to higher photosynthetic capability. In the field, the inhibition rate of F-v/F-m in single cells increased significantly faster than that of colonies as light increased (P < 0.05), but nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) value of colonies was higher (32.4%) than that of single cells at noon, which indicated colonial cells can more effectively resist high-light inhibition than single cells (P < 0.05). Polysaccharides of colonies were significantly higher compared to those in unicellular cells (P < 0.05) based on their contents and ultrastructural characteristics. This finding implies that colonies could not effectively decrease photoinhibition by negative buoyancy regulation. In fact, NPQ may be an important mechanism for avoiding photodamage. All of these phenomena can help explain the ecological success of colonial M. aeruginosa in eutrophic water.					yu, yang/HIZ-9682-2022	, Min/0000-0002-8130-5214													0022-3646	1529-8817				JUN	2011	47	3					524	532		10.1111/j.1529-8817.2011.00987.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1529-8817.2011.00987.x								27021981					WOS:000292064000009

Multi-annual response of a Pampean shallow lake from central Argentina to regional and large-scale climate forcings	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												The Pampean Plains comprise a flat area of southeastern South America (SESA), encompassing the most populated and productive area of Argentina. Several floods and droughts have been reported in the region during the last 50years affecting lakeshore villages. In spite of the well-known importance of monitoring hydrological systems in flood-risk areas, long series of instrumental limnimetric data are sparse in the Pampean Plains. Lake Melincue (33 degrees 43S/61 degrees 28W), located in the center of this region, provides a valuable record of the annual lake-area oscillations from 1965 to 2015. In this study we analyze the lake area variability at different time-scales, from intra-annual to multi-annual, investigating the persistence and the frequencies of the series. Our results show that the lake area oscillates following a significant quasi-bidecadal periodicity. A secondary 13 years-frequency signal was detected since the 1970s, when a dramatic increase in Lake Melincue area occurred, associated with a shift to humid conditions in SESA. The analysis of meteorological series suggests that lake area variations are controlled by precipitation and evaporation with different time-lags. Further comparisons of the lake area fluctuations with climate indices from the Pacific and Atlantic oceans provide evidence of the link between the dynamic of lakes in the Pampean Plains and both large-scale climate circulation and low-frequency phenomena. These results confirm that a regular monitoring of these shallow lake systems and the analysis of high-resolution reliable data on inland water environments of the Pampean Plains is fundamental for anticipating their hydrological responses to forecasted climate changes.

Reconstruction of environmental and climate changes at Braamhoek wetland, eastern escarpment South Africa, during the last 16,000 years with emphasis on the Pleistocene-Holocene transition	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												A paleo-environmental record covering the last 16 ka (16,000 cal yrs BP) from the eastern areas of the summer rainfall region in South Africa is presented. This area is until now sparsely investigated due to the lack of well preserved natural archives. For this study, we used a peat section from a wetland situated close to the Drakensberg escarpment, where the high annual rainfall amounts supported a continuous peat accumulation since c. 16 ka. One peat core was analysed in terms of fossil pollen composition, carbon and nitrogen content, isotope composition (delta C-13, delta N-15) and microscopic charcoal concentration. The greatest degree of temporal resolution was achieved from the late Pleistocene and early Holocene section, where proxy-records indicate relatively dry conditions between ca. 16-13.7 ka, 12.8-10.5 ka, 9.5-8.2 ka, and wet conditions between c. 13.7-12.8 ka and 10.5-9.5 ka. A weak moisture signal is also evident at c. 8.2-7.5 ka. The late Pleistocene to early Holocene period was relatively cool, while conditions became generally warmer after 11-8 ka. The interpretation of the mid- and late-Holocene sequence is limited due to a slow accumulation and low sample resolution, but the available data suggest relatively dry conditions until c. 1.5 ka, followed by more humid conditions until c. 0.5 ka. We suggest that the millennial scale variability within the record can be attributed to shifts in the circulation systems dominating the region, i.e. the latitudinal movements of the inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ) and the dynamics of the mid-latitude low pressure belts.

Two years later, mussels achieved densities of 4000 adults m(-2), representing the first record of successful colonization by zebra mussels in the Iberian Peninsula. An August 2003 study investigated the environmental conditions that support the successful settlement of the zebra mussel populations during the stratification period. Flow patterns in the whole system and mussel populations near the dam were characterized. Chemical characteristics of water inputs, not the usual thermal stratification, determine the deep circulation of the Ebro River along the Riba-Roja reservoir, whereas water input from one tributary into Riba-Roja flows along the top of the water. Physico-chemical stratification of the water column seems to control the observed vertical distribution of zebra mussel biomass. Larger biomass and mean body size were found in the epilimnion, while meta- and hypolimnetic individuals were smaller in size and composed a lower biomass. Moreover, to know the influence of the water drawn off for electricity production in the settlement of mussel larvae, an artificial substratum (a rope) was placed in the influence area of the dam. Results indicate that flow conditions prevailing in the drawn-water layer may increase the attachment success of mussel larvae. Results show that during the stratification period the epilimnion of Riba-Roj a was functioning as a "biological reactor" where Dreissena populations thrived.

Using a Web-Based Diary Method to Estimate Risks and Benefits from Fish Consumption	RISK ANALYSIS												Accurate estimates of the amount and type of fish people eat are necessary to determine the health benefits and risks of consuming fish, and to assess compliance with fish consumption guidelines issued for fish affected by chemical contaminants. We developed a web-based and mobile-phone-enabled diary methodology to collect detailed fish consumption information for two 16-week periods in the summers of 2014 and 2015. We recruited study participants from two populations living in the Great Lakes regionwomen of childbearing age (WCBA) and urban residents who had purchased fishing licenses. In this article, we describe the methodology in detail and provide evidence related to participation rates, the representativeness of our sample over time, and both convergent validity and reliability of the data collection methods. Overall, 56% of WCBA and 50% of urban anglers provided complete data across both data collection periods. Among those who provided information at the beginning of Year 2, 97% of both audiences provided information throughout the entire 16-week period. Those who participated throughout the two-year period were slightly older on average (1.9-2.5 years) than other members of our original samples. We conclude that using diaries with web and smartphone technology, combined with incentives and persistent communication, has strong potential for assessing fish consumption in other areas of the country or for situations where the potential risks associated with fish consumption are substantial and the cost can be justified.																			0272-4332	1539-6924				JUN	2018	38	6					1116	1127		10.1111/risa.12925	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/risa.12925								29059714					WOS:000434645900003

Processes, facies and architecture of fluvial distributary system deposits	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY					Conference on Drylands - Linking Landscape Processes to SedimentaryEnvironments	FEB 02-04, 2005	Geol Soc, London, ENGLAND		Geol Soc			There is evidence from the stratigraphic m-cord of examples of fluvial deposits that were the products of deposition from river systems which had decreasing discharge down-flow and transitions from proximal, channelised to distal, unconfined flow. These deposits form fan-shaped bodies several tens of kilometres in radius, and their stratigraphic architecture is aggradational, with no evidence of deep incision driven by base-level fall. The fluvial systems that generated these deposits formed under conditions for which there is no complete analogue today: an endorheic basin with a relatively and climate adjacent to an uplifted area with higher precipitation. A conceptual model for fluvial systems of this type has therefore been built on the basis of outcrop examples and a consideration of the controls on sedimentation. Proximal areas are characterised by amalgamated coarse, pebbly and sandy channel deposits with little preservation of overbank facies. Channel dimensions are generally smaller in the medial areas, but sizes are variable: deposits are of braided, meandering and simple channels which show varying degrees of lateral migration, The channel-fills may be mud or sand, with overbank flow processes playing an important role in filling channels abandoned on the floodplain after avulsion. The proportion of overbank deposits increases distally with sheets of sand deposited as lateral and terminal splays by unconfined flow. Interconnection of sandstone bodies is poor in the distal areas because channel-fill bodies are sparse, small and are not deeply incised. The radial pattern of the sediment body fortus by the repeated avulsion of channels: active channels build up lobes on the alluvial plain and rivers switch position to follow courses on lower lying areas. The term 'fluvial distributary system' is here used to describe a river system which has a downstream decrease in discharge and has a distal zone which is characterised either by terminal splays on to a dry alluvial plain or a lake delta during periods of lake highstand.

J	Fisk, AT; Hobson, KA; Norstrom, RJ				Fisk, AT; Hobson, KA; Norstrom, RJ			Influence of chemical and biological factors on trophic transfer of persistent organic pollutants in the northwater polynya marine food web	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and stable isotopes of nitrogen (delta N-15) were measured in zooplankton (6 species), a benthic invertebrate (Anonyx nugax), Arctic cod (Boreogados saida), seabirds (6 species), and ringed seals (Phoca hispida) collected in 1998 in the Northwater Polynya to examine effects of biological and chemical factors on trophic transfer of POPs in an Arctic marine food web. Strong positive relationships were found between recalcitrant POP concentrations (lipid corrected) and trophic level based on stable isotopes of nitrogen, providing clear evidence of POP biomagnification in Arctic marine food webs. Food web magnification factors (FWMFs), derived from the slope of the POP-trophic level relationship, provided an overall magnification factor for the food web but over and underestimated biomagnification factors (BMFs) based on predator-prey concentrations in poikilotherms (fish) and homeotherms (seabirds and mammals), respectively. Greater biomagnification in homeotherms was attributed to their greater energy requirement and subsequent feeding rates. Within the homeotherms, seabirds had greater BMFs than ringed seals, consistent with greater energy demands in birds. Scavenging from marine mammal carcasses and accumulation in more contaminated winter habitats were considered important variables in seabird BMFs. Metabolic differences between species resulted in lower than expected BMFs, which would not be recognized in whole food web trophic level-POP relationships. The use of Sigma POP groups, such as Sigma PCB, is problematic because FWMFs and BMFs varied considerably between individual POPs. FWMFs of recalcitrant POPs had a strong positive relationship with log octanol-water partition coefficient (K-ow). Results of this study show the utility of using delta N-15 to characterize trophic level and trophic transfer of POPs but highlight the effects of species and chemical differences on trophic transfer of POPs that can be overlooked when a single magnification factor is applied to an entire food web.

Compound effects of water clarity, inflow, wind and climate warming on mountain lake thermal regimes	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Many studies have examined the effects of climate warming on lake stability, but few have addressed environmental changes concomitant with climate change, such as alterations in water clarity and lake inflow. Although air temperature rise is a predominant factor linked to lake thermal characteristics, climate-driven changes at watershed scales can substantially alter lake clarity and inflow, exacerbating the effects of future air warming on lake thermal conditions. Without accounting for potential changes in clarity and inflow, future thermal predictions could be inaccurate. We employed the General Lake Model to simulate future thermal conditions (relative thermal resistance to mixing; RTRM) of small (< 12 ha) mountain lakes of the western United States by calibrating the model to a set of lakes in the Southern Rocky Mountains, USA. We found that after air temperature, alterations in inflow had the largest effect on lake thermal conditions, changes in wind had the least effect, and larger lakes experienced more than double the increase in lake stability than smaller lakes. Generally, clear, high inflow lakes had the lowest stability now, and in the future, while the largest overall increase in thermal stability occurred in larger lakes with low inflows and high turbidity. Assuming air temperature rise alone, summer stability of mountain lakes of the western United States was predicted to increase by 15-23% at + 2 degrees C air temperatures, and by 39-62% at + 5 degrees C air temperatures. When accounting for associated changes in clarity and inflow, lake stability was predicted to increase by 208% with + 2 degrees C air warming and 318% with at 5 degrees C air warming. Thus, ignoring the multivariate effects of climate change can substantially underestimate changes to mountain lake thermal and stratification regimes. Dimictic lakes may become more strongly stratified and polymictic lakes will experience more prolonged stratification. While predicted changes to lake temperatures may not be harmful to trout species that currently inhabit mountain lakes, longer and more intense stratification could cause indirect effects, such as hypoxia, that could reduce growth and survival of these organisms.																			1015-1621	1420-9055				JAN	2020	82	1							6	10.1007/s00027-019-0676-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-019-0676-6													WOS:000497662600002

Continental-scale variation in chloride/bromide ratios of wet deposition	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Chlorine and bromine play crucial roles in atmospheric element cycles and are important environmental tracers in catchment investigations, so understanding their distribution at the Earth's near-surface is imperative for deciphering their behaviour. This study presents the first continental-scale analysis of Cl- and Br- concentrations of wet deposition, based on six and half years of weekly samples collected across North America. A recently developed imputation algorithm was applied to estimate the high proportion of censored Br- values, as well as the other eight analytes, based on the multivariate relationships of nine analytes. The results are consistent with previous studies that have found that the concentrations of these two ions in wet deposition, and the Cl-/Br- ratios of wet deposition decrease with distance inland. Close to the coast, Cl-/Br- ratios of wet deposition are similar to the ratio found in seawater (similar to 288 by mass), rapidly decrease to approximately a third of the seawater ratio at similar to 200 km inland, and then decrease at a much lesser rate to reach mass-ratios of 20 to 10 at similar to 1500 km inland, following a logarithmic regression. The Niagara Falls and the Great Salt Lake are identified as localised sources of atmospheric solutes based on elevated Cl-/Br- ratios of wet deposition at proximal sites. Our observations provide further confidence in the findings presented in previous studies that have shown that Cl-/Br- ratios systematically decrease with increasing distance from the coast, despite the potential confounding impact of other processes, such as weather patterns, chemical behaviour and anthropogenic activity. Our results provide improved estimates of Cl-/Br- ratios of wet deposition source water in the absence of site-specific data. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Costelloe, JF; Grayson, RB; McMahon, TA; Argent, RM				Costelloe, JF; Grayson, RB; McMahon, TA; Argent, RM			Spatial and temporal variability of water salinity in an ephemeral, arid-zone river, central Australia	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												This study describes the spatial and temporal variability of water salinity of the Neales-Peake, an ephemeral river system in the arid Lake Eyre basin of central Australia. Saline to hypersaline waterholes occur in the lower reaches of the Neales-Peake catchment and lie downstream of subcatchments containing artesian mound springs. Flood pulses are fresh in the upper reaches of the rivers (< 200 mg 1(-1)). In the salt-affected reaches, flood pulses become increasingly saline during their recession. It is hypothesized that leakage from the Great Artesian Basin deposits salt at the surface. This salt is then transported by infrequent runoff events into the main river system over long periods of time. The bank/floodplain store downstream of salt-affected catchments contains high salt concentrations, and this salt is mobilized during the flow recession when bank/floodplain storage discharges into the channel. The salinity of the recession increases as the percentage of flow derived from this storage increases. A simple conceptual model was developed for investigating the salt movement processes during flow events. The model structure for transport of water and salt in the Neales-Peake catchment generated similar spatial and temporal patterns of salt distribution in the floodplain/bank storage and water flow as observed during flow events in 2000-02. However, more field-data collection and modelling are required for improved calibration and description of salt transport and storage processes, particularly with regard to the number of stores required to represent the salt distribution in the upper zone of the soil profile.

Phosphorus loading from floodplain farms (132 x 10(6) g P/yr) has been the primary cause of eutrophication, Assuming elimination of farm P loading, the Vollenweider model predicts a decline in equilibrium P concentration from 0.270 to 0.024 g/m3, if the P sedimentation coefficient (sigma) remains constant. It is likely, however, that the value for sigma will fall with the elimination of farm loading due to unabated internal P loading from the sediments. Under a worst-case scenario (sigma = 0), the model predicts that exportation of P from the lake via wetland filtration will greatly accelerate the lake's recovery. Recirculation of lake water through a 21-km2, created wetland and elimination of farm P loading is projected to result in a negative P balance for the lake (-23 x 10(6) g P/yr) leading to depletion of P stores in the lake in about 60 yr. The estimated cost of the project, $20 million, is less than 3% of the estimated cost of dredging. A 3.65-km2 demonstration project is underway to test and refine the wetland filtration technique. We believe the technique could be cost-effective for other hypertrophic lakes.																			0364-152X					JAN-FEB	1992	16	1					67	74		10.1007/BF02393909	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02393909													WOS:A1992GY81800006

The lake consists of two separate water layers, which do not intermix. A lower water layer of the lake below some 3-m depth is stagnant and anaerobic, and radiocesium load of the sediments is mainly caused by nuclear weapons fallout. The radiocesium load of the sediments of the upper monomictic water layer is significantly larger due to additional contamination after the Chernobyl accident. Radiocesium activity concentrations in lake water increase with depth, and even in the surface layer, they are commonly the largest among the neighboring lakes with transparent water. It is shown that bottom areas of the monomictic part of the lake with the elevated radiocesium deepening into sediments are related to the favorite sites of the tench (Tinca tinca) winter torpor. Sediment bioturbation and redistribution due to tench activities distort naturally formed radiocesium vertical profiles and they cannot be used for estimations of sedimentation rates and sediment chronology. The studied lake can be useful as an analogous model in analyzing structural and radiological consequences of humic water Mows to closed lakes.

J	MITTELBACH, GG				MITTELBACH, GG			FORAGING EFFICIENCY AND BODY SIZE - A STUDY OF OPTIMAL DIET AND HABITAT USE BY BLUEGILLS	ECOLOGY												A foraging model was developed to predict the optimal diet breath and maximum energetic intake of a given-sized fish foraging in each of 3 aquatic habitats: open water, vegetation and bare sediments. Model parameters of prey encounter rates and prey handling times were quantified as functions of fish size, prey density and prey size through a series of laboratory feeding experiments using the bluegill sunfish (L. macrochirus). Both searching ability and prey handling efficiency increased with increasing fish size. Predictions of prey size selection and optimal habitat use based upon maximizing energetic gain were examined in a small Michigan (USA) Lake for 3 size classes of bluegills. Bluegills > 100 mm standard length were highly size selective in their feeding and their diets closely matched predictions of an optimal diet model. From 2 estimates of relative prey visibilities these fish selected larger prey items than would be predicted if prey were consumed as encountered. Habitat use of large bluegills maximized foraging return as fish switched from using vegetation-living prey to using open-water zooplankton as relative foraging profitabilities in the 2 habitats changed across the summer. Bluegills < 100 mm standard length were restricted in their habitat use, remaining in or near the vegetation despite demonstrated increases in foraging return available in the open-water habitat. Size-related predation risk apparently counts for differences in habitat use between bluegill size classes, and its consequences for intra- and interspecific competition between size classes are discussed.

A multi-proxy investigation of late-Holocene temperature change and climate-driven fluctuations in sediment sourcing: Simpson Lagoon, Alaska	HOLOCENE												The significant and ongoing environmental changes in Arctic regions demonstrate the need for quantitative, high-resolution records of pre-industrial climate change in this climatically sensitive region; such records are fundamental for understanding recent anthropogenic changes in the context of natural variability. Sediment contained within Arctic coastal environments proximal to large fluvial systems has the ability to record paleoclimate variability on subdecadal to decadal scale resolution, on par with many other terrestrial climate archives (i.e. lake sediments, ice cores). Here, we utilize one such sediment archive from Simpson Lagoon, Alaska, located adjacent to the Colville River Delta to reconstruct temperature variability and fluctuations in sediment sourcing over the past 1700 years. Quantitative reconstructions of summer air temperature are obtained using the branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether (brGDGT)-derived methylation index of branched tetraethers (MBT')/cyclization ratio of branched tetraether (CBT) paleothermometer and reveal temperature departures correlative with noted climate events (i.e. 'Little Ice Age', 'Medieval Climate Anomaly'). In addition, temporal variability in sediment sourcing to the lagoon, determined using a multi-proxy approach (i.e. granulometry, elemental analysis, clay mineralogy), broadly corresponds with temperature fluctuations, indicating relative increases in fluvial sediment discharge during colder intervals and decreased river discharge/increased coastal erosion during warmer periods. The Simpson Lagoon record presented in this study is the first temperature reconstruction, to our knowledge, developed from coastal marine sediments in the Alaskan Beaufort Sea.

Climate-induced Late-Holocene ecological changes in Pichavaram estuary, India	MARINE ECOLOGY-AN EVOLUTIONARY PERSPECTIVE												Variation in sedimentology as well as freshwater and marine palynomorphs has been studied in ecological perspective in two 2.5- and 5-m deep sediment cores deposited since 3440 and 3630cal BP, respectively in the central part of Pichavaram mangrove wetland, Cauvery River delta. The palynological and sedimentological results of the sediments reveal a monsoonal circulation and a climatic shift from warm and humid with strengthened monsoon (3630-3190cal BP) to dry and arid (similar to 2750-760cal BP). Since the last millennium (similar to 760cal BP), Pichavaram estuary has been influenced by a similar cyclicity but with a less wet and humid climate due to weakened monsoon conditions. These ecological changes in turn affect the relative sea level rise and fall which is reflected by the variability/extinction of freshwater and marine palynomorphs. The estuary remained an active water channel between similar to 3630 and 2750cal BP, responding to the strengthened monsoon, during which the freshwater algal remains with thecamoebians and marine dinoflagellate cysts and foraminiferal linings both dominated with a ratio of 1.5 for marine/freshwater forms. After this period, since similar to 2750cal BP there has been a dominance of marine forms with a ratio of 4.5 for marine/freshwater forms, indicating fluvio-marine sediment deposition and suggesting the recent landward intrusion of seawater during weakened monsoon conditions. Freshwater thecamoebians are vulnerable to the salinity >3 in the aqueous soil solution of estuarine sediment, and therefore serve as an excellent proxy for monitoring salinity gradient along with short-term high resolution palaeoecological fluctuations induced by climate and relative sea-level changes in an estuarine ecosystem.

High resolution pollen records are available for all seven RPAZs typical of this interglacial in Central Europe. These pollen records were used to estimate total annual precipitation and mean annual temperature, as well as the mean temperatures of the warmest and the coldest months based on the plant in-dicator method and the modern analogue technique. The reconstructions indicate that the combination of these two methods provides a much clearer insight into the climate changes of the Eemian optimum. The results confirmed no drastic drop in temperature in the Middle Eemian, with high total precipitation in the hazel phase, and that this was followed by a decrease in temperature in the Late Eemian (fir-spruce and pine phases). A drop in precipitation occurred during the youngest part of the Carpinus phase, while coincided with a marked lowering of the water level in lakes and their transformation into peatbogs. The last part of the Eemian is characterized by decreasing temperature, particularly during the coldest month, rising water levels due to a combination of lower evaporation and higher air humidity, and a transition to glacial conditions. Principal Component Analysis found all investigated sites to follow the same pattern of changes. Mean winter temperature, annual temperature and precipitation were found to have a strong positive correlation with the occurrence of thermophilus temperate broadleaved trees (hazel, linden, and ash) typical for the mid-Eemian optimum. These three factors also have a negative correlation with the presence of cold tolerant boreal trees (birch and pine) and open land taxa char-acteristic of the beginning and end of the interglacial. Mean July temperature was found to be positively correlated with the occurrence of temperate broadleaved trees (oak, ash and elm) typical for early stages of the Eemian and negatively with that of coniferous trees (fir and spruce) characteristic for later stages of the interglacial.					; Hrynowiecka, Anna/E-5661-2019; Poska, Anneli/O-7358-2015	Pidek, Irena/0000-0002-1979-4897; Hrynowiecka, Anna/0000-0002-6878-9007; Zarski, Marcin/0000-0002-0699-6561													1040-6182	1873-4553				SEP 20	2022	632						21	35		10.1016/j.quaint.2021.09.014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2021.09.014		AUG 2022											WOS:000878325600003

For the genetic analysis, 7 populations were sampled and 2 monophyletic groups were identified with a genetic difference of D-HKY = 3.4% (3-3.8%), one being the populations from the lower Lerma basin, Ameca and Chapala Lake, and the other populations from Zacapu and Cuitzeo Lakes. For the morphometric analysis, 4 populations were sampled and 2 morphotypes identified, I from La Luz Spring in the lower Lerma basin and the other from Zacapu and Cuitzeo Lakes drainages. Using these 2 sources of evidence, the population from La Luz is regarded as a new species Zoogoneticus purhepechus sp. nov. The new species differs from its sister species Zoogoneticus quitzeoensis in having a shorter preorbital distance (Prol/SL (x) over bar = 0.056, SD = 0.01), longer dorsal fin base length (DFL/SL (x) over bar = 0.18, SD = 0.03) and 13-14 rays in the dot-sat fin. The new species differs from both members of its sister taxon (Zoogoneticus tequila and Z. quitzeoensis) at 10 fixed nucleotide positions in the cytochrome b gene. We have determined that Zoogoneticus purhepechus is distributed in the lower Lerma, upper Ameca, Armeria and Santiago river basins, and Chapala Lake. This new species should be considered endangered of extinction according to the criteria of the MER (Aii,Bi,Ci,Di) and for the IUCN (A-l,b,c,c).

The maximum uptake rate of the applied organic compounds in Lake Grevelingen was generally < 10% of the C mineralization rate calculated from the O2 consumption experiments. Only for pyruvate and glycollate were higher values found of .apprx. 30-40%, with 1 exceptionally high value for pyruvate of 149%. These higher percentages were found in winter, when the activity of the heterotrophic microbial population was very low. In Etang Salses Leucate higher maximum uptake rates of the 14C-labeled compounds were found, relating this uptake to the O2 consumption rate. The maximum uptake rate is still always < 35% of the C mineralization calculated from the O2 uptake rate. Taking into account that maximum uptake rates were considered, apparently the uptake of 14C-labeled organic compounds represents a serious underestimation of the activity of the bacterial population in situ. The extent of the underestimation depends on the water type. The determination of the heterotrophic activity by measuring O2 consumption rates apparently offers a better insight into the C mineralization process in natural waters than the uptake experiments with 14C-labeled substrates.																			0025-3162	1432-1793					1982	66	3					237	242		10.1007/BF00397028	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00397028													WOS:A1982NF92200005

However, the accumulation dynamics of plutonium from atmospheric deposition to preservation in the sediment is still controversial. Three sediment cores collected from two maar lakes with high-quality chronology were analyzed for 239,240Pu. The first high-yield thermonuclear test (31st October 1952) and the highest global tests in 1961-1962 were identified, respectively, as the first rapidly increased 239,240Pu in 1953 and peaked in 1963. In anoxic Lake Sihailongwan (SHLW), scavenging Pu from the water to sediment was accelerated due to the major particulate associated forms of Pu(III) and Pu(IV) and rapidly elevated dust flux when ice-melting occurred in every spring. The desorption of Pu from beneath sediment to the lake water and resorption by sediment particles were stronger in shallow and oxic Lake Huguangyan. Therefore, the first rapid increase of 239,240Pu in 1953 and peak in 1963 accompanied by rapid scavenging and well preservation of plutonium provide a robust time marker for the "Great Acceleration", and this marker nearly permanently exists in such kind of lake sediment similar to Lake SHLW.

Mantle sources of the Cenozoic volcanic rocks of the Lake Kizi region in the eastern Sikhote Alin	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF PACIFIC GEOLOGY												The Middle Cenozoic lava sequence of the Lake Kizi region was studied. It characterizes the activity of sources in the Northern zone of the eastern Sikhote Alin: a Middle Eocene pulse of slab-related magmatism and prolonged injection of magmas from the sublithospheric convecting mantle in the Late Oligocene. Low contents of high field strength elements (Nb and Ta) with low Nb/Ta, Ce/Pb, and Nb/La and high K/Nb ratios and a low (Sr-87/Sr-86)(0) of 0.703399 were determined in a Middle Eocene dacite with an age of similar to 43.5 Ma. Three phases of Late Oligocene volcanic eruptions were distinguished: (1) basaltic andesites (29-27 Ma), (2) basaltic trachyandesites and trachyandesites (27-24 Ma), and (3) andesites (similar to 23 Ma). The lavas of the first and third phases showed low Ce/Pb, Nb/La, and Ba/La and high K/Nb ratios, which are also characteristic of supraslab processes. The lavas of the second phase are shifted with respect to these ratios toward ocean island basalt compositions. The entire Late Oligocene volcanic sequence falls within a narrow range of the initial strontium isotope ratios, (Sr-87/Sr-86)(0), from 0.703661 to 0.703853. Such ratios are characteristic of volcanic and subvolcanic rocks with ages of similar to 37, 31-23, and similar to 16 Ma over the whole region of the Tatar Strait coast.					; Prikhod'ko, Vladimir/K-1472-2018; Yasnygina, Tatyana/AAG-5547-2021; Войнова, Ирина/HIU-0957-2022; Rasskazov, Sergei/G-2977-2014	Yasnygina, Tatyana/0000-0003-1696-5539; Rasskazov, Sergei/0000-0001-9084-1652													1819-7140	1819-7159				OCT	2010	4	5					441	458		10.1134/S1819714010050076	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1819714010050076													WOS:000283251000008

Carbon and nitrogen recycling during cyanoHABs in dreissenid-invaded and non-invaded US midwestern lakes and reservoirs	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Lakes and reservoirs play key roles in global carbon cycling, especially as a carbon sink. Enrichment of nutrients in lakes and reservoirs (eutrophication) and rising global temperatures favors the proliferation of bloom-forming cyanobacteria. Harmful blooms of cyanobacteria (cyanoHABs) alter carbon and nutrient cycling in freshwater ecosystems. Some evidence suggests the introduction or establishment of invasive mussel species (i.e., Dreissena spp.) also favor cyanoHAB formation through selective filter feeding, a process through which they may also impact biogeochemical processes including carbon cycling and sequestration. However, few studies have considered the combined effects of invasive mussels and cyanoHABs on carbon and nitrogen cycling in freshwater ecosystems. Here, we examined microbial community composition and biogeochemical attributes (including carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes) in eutrophic lakes, reservoirs, and rivers in western Ohio, eastern Indiana, and northern Kentucky during the cyanobacterial bloom period of the summer of 2015. Our samples include both sites impacted by invasive mussels and those where invasive mussels have not yet been observed. Based on 16S and 18S rRNA gene sequence analysis, we found that cyanobacterial and algal communities varied across sites and were most closely related to habitat (sediment or water column sample) and site, regardless of the presence of invasive mussels or other environmental factors. However, we did find evidence that invasive mussels may influence both carbon and nitrogen cycling. While the results are based on a single time point sampling, they highlight the interactions of multiple environmental stressors in aquatic ecosystems and the critical need for more temporally intensive studies of carbon and nutrient cycling in bloom- and mussel-impacted waters.

J	Hansen, AG; Beauchamp, DA				Hansen, Adam G.; Beauchamp, David A.			Effects of prey abundance, distribution, visual contrast and morphology on selection by a pelagic piscivore	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Most predators eat only a subset of possible prey. However, studies evaluating diet selection rarely measure prey availability in a manner that accounts for temporal-spatial overlap with predators, the sensory mechanisms employed to detect prey, and constraints on prey capture. 2. We evaluated the diet selection of cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii) feeding on a diverse planktivore assemblage in Lake Washington to test the hypothesis that the diet selection of piscivores would reflect random (opportunistic) as opposed to non-random (targeted) feeding, after accounting for predator-prey overlap, visual detection and capture constraints. 3. Diets of cutthroat trout were sampled in autumn 2005, when the abundance of transparent, age-0 longfin smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys) was low, and 2006, when the abundance of smelt was nearly seven times higher. Diet selection was evaluated separately using depth-integrated and depth-specific (accounted for predator-prey overlap) prey abundance. The abundance of different prey was then adjusted for differences in detectability and vulnerability to predation to see whether these factors could explain diet selection. 4. In 2005, cutthroat trout fed non-randomly by selecting against the smaller, transparent age-0 longfin smelt, but for the larger age-1 longfin smelt. After adjusting prey abundance for visual detection and capture, cutthroat trout fed randomly. In 2006, depth-integrated and depth-specific abundance explained the diets of cutthroat trout well, indicating random feeding. Feeding became non-random after adjusting for visual detection and capture. Cutthroat trout selected strongly for age-0 longfin smelt, but against similar sized threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and larger age-1 longfin smelt in 2006. Overlap with juvenile sockeye salmon (O. nerka) was minimal in both years, and sockeye salmon were rare in the diets of cutthroat trout. 5. The direction of the shift between random and non-random selection depended on the presence of a weak versus a strong year class of age-0 longfin smelt. These fish were easy to catch, but hard to see. When their density was low, poor detection could explain their rarity in the diet. When their density was high, poor detection was compensated by higher encounter rates with cutthroat trout, sufficient to elicit a targeted feeding response. The nature of the feeding selectivity of a predator can be highly dependent on fluctuations in the abundance and suitability of key prey.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				NOV	2014	59	11					2328	2341		10.1111/fwb.12436	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12436													WOS:000343047000010

Global climate change issues have raised new concerns about nitrogen (N) management as it relates to crop production even though there may not be an immediate threat to water quality. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are frequently considered the primary cause of global climate change, but under anaerobic conditions, animals can contribute by expelling methane (CH4) as do soil microbes. In terms of the potential for global climate change, CH4 is similar to 25 times more harmful than CO2. This differential effect is minuscule compared to when nitrous oxide (N2O) is released into the atmosphere because it is similar to 300 times more harmful than CO2. N2O losses from soil have been positively correlated with residual N (nitrate, NO3) concentrations in soil. It stands to reason that phytoremediation via nitrate scavenger crops is one approach to help protect air quality, as well as soil and water quality. Winter wheat was inserted into a seed corn/soybean rotation to utilize soil nitrate and thereby reduce the potential for nitrate leaching and N2O emissions. The net effect of the 2001-2003 relay cropping sequence was to produce three crops in two years, scavenge 130 kg N/ha from the root zone, produce an extra 2 Mg residue/ha, and increase producer profitability by similar to$ 250/ha.

The program enrolled licensed anglers and Burmese refugees and immigrants, living near four designated Great Lakes Areas of Concern: Buffalo River, Niagara River, Eighteenmile Creek, and the Rochester Embayment. These target populations were sampled and enrolled independently into the program between February and October of 2013. A core set of contaminants were measured in blood and urine of 409 licensed anglers and 206 Burmese refugees and immigrants which included lead, cadmium, mercury, PCBs, PBDEs, organochlorine pesticides (hexachlorobenzene, mirex, DDT, DDE, and chlordane and its metabolites oxychlordane and trans-Nonachlor), and PFOS and PFOA. Biomonitoring results showed that both groups had higher geometric means for blood lead, total blood mercury, and serum PFOS compared to the 2013-2014 NHANES reference levels. The Burmese refugee group also showed higher geometric means for creatinine-adjusted urine mercury and lipid-adjusted serum DDE compared to national levels. Licensed angler participants reported eating a median of 16 locally caught fish meals in the past year. Burmese participants consumed local fish throughout the year, and most frequently in the summer (median 39 fish meals or 3 times a week). The study results provide valuable information on populations at high risk of exposure to contaminants in the Great Lakes Basin of western New York. The results provide the foundation for developing and implementing public health actions to reduce potential exposures to Great Lakes pollutants.					; Parsons, Patrick/I-2985-2015; Kannan, Kurunthachalam/ACA-0037-2022; Rej, Robert/KWU-1195-2024	Rej, Robert/0000-0001-9578-5856; Parsons, Patrick/0000-0001-9133-875X; Kannan, Kurunthachalam/0000-0002-1926-7456; 													0013-9351	1096-0953				DEC	2019	179								108690	10.1016/j.envres.2019.108690	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2019.108690								31491725					WOS:000497259100029

An evaluation of catchment-scale phosphorus mitigation using load apportionment modelling	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Functional relationships between phosphorus (P) discharge and concentration mechanisms were explored using a load apportionment model (LAM) developed for use in a freshwater catchment in Ireland with fourteen years of data (1995-2008). The aim of model conceptualisation was to infer changes in point and diffuse sources from catchment P loading during P mitigation, based upon a dataset comprising geospatial and water quality data from a 256 km(2) lake catchment in an intensively farmed drumlin region of the midlands of Ireland. The model was calibrated using river total P (TP), molybdate reactive P (MRP) and runoff data from seven subcatchments. Temporal and spatial heterogeneity of P sources existed within and between subcatchments: these were attributed to differences in agricultural intensity, soil type and anthropogenically-sourced effluent P loading. Catchment rivers were sensitive to flow regime, which can result in eutrophication of rivers during summer and lake enrichment from frequent flood events. For one sewage impacted river, the LAM estimated that point sourced P contributed up to of 90% of annual MRP load delivered during a hydrological year and in this river point P sources dominated flows up to 92% of days. In the other rivers, despite diffuse P forming a majority of the annual P exports, point sources of P dominated flows for up to 64% of a hydrological year. The calibrated model demonstrated that lower P export rates followed specific P mitigation measures. The LAM estimated up to 80% decreases in point MRP load after enhanced P removal at waste water treatments plants in urban subcatchments and the implementation of septic tank and agricultural bye-laws in rural subcatchments. The LAM approach provides a way to assess the long-term effectiveness of further measures to reduce P loadings in EU (International) River Basin Districts and subcatchments. (C) 2011 Elsevier BM.

The materials analyzed were four sediment cores obtained from three basins in Notoro Lagoon using pushing-piston corers. An artificial inlet was excavated at the lagoon in 1977. Immediately after excavation, CNS contents in the sediment began to decrease, and benthic foraminiferal assemblages shifted due to high-oxygen seawater inflow. There was a 7-year transition before the lagoon environment and ecosystem were stable. After inlet excavation, the bottom environment and benthic foraminiferal assemblage of Notoro Lagoon were strongly influenced by short-term climate oscillations such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and Arctic Oscillation. Frequent short-duration peaks of oxygen-proxy foraminiferal taxa and decreases in total organic carbon in sediment were confirmed between 1986 and 1998. This transition occurred because the spring air temperature and pressure over Notoro Lagoon were affected by the short-term climate oscillations, which have determined the timing of lake ice melt and the volume of oxygen-rich seawater inflow. As a result, bottom conditions and the benthic ecosystem of the Notoro Lagoon have shifted along with these regional climate changes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The platform has recently been exposed by a fall in lake level due to upstream dam construction and exhibits micro-landforms ranging from pits and grooves to upstanding crenulate ridges produced by differential chemical weathering under relatively constant conditions over the last ca. 10 000 years. The maximum surface lowering rate of the calcitic layers estimated from differential weathering is 35 mm ka(-1), which is about an order of magnitude greater than most previous estimates from alpine and polar periglacial environments. Average bedrock surface lowering across the whole platform reached a maximum of 15.5 +/- 2.2 mm ka(-1) in a vertical zone corresponding with the former lake level, declining to negligible values around 0.7 m below lake level. Differential weathering and bedrock surface lowering were also negligible immediately above lake level. Correspondence of maximum surface lowering rates with the former lake level and a shoreline notch at the back of a platform suggest that the effects of solutional weathering of the calcite have been enhanced by water movement generated by small lake-surface waves.

These identifications were based on morphological criteria and supported by mitochondrial DNA sequence data that also indicates little or no divergence of the newly reported populations, which is consistent with evolutionarily recent spread or separation. Spurwinkia salsa was most likely introduced to San Francisco Bay either in recent decades in bait worm packing or ships' ballast or in the 19th or early 20th century in solid ballast or with oyster imports. The discovery of T. porrecta in artificial lakes in the Phoenix area in 1984 and 2014 may be due to either recent arrival in the area or to dispersal into a newly available habitat from a population long present in the area. In either case, the occurrence of T. porrecta in the Phoenix area is likely due to transport on birds along an eastern branch of the Pacific Flyway. The discovery of T. porrecta in artificial lakes suggests that this species (which is typically distributed in thermal springs) is more broadly tolerant than previously thought. Additional spread of this unusual snail within the highly modified aquatic ecosystem of the Phoenix metropolitan area (which includes more than 900 artificial lakes) would appear likely.

Moreover, these metabolites have been thought to cause serious diseases including certain cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. On the other hand, Ulothrix is a genus of filamentous green algae, generally found in fresh water and marine and abundantly available in some lakes and rivers of Turkey. To our best knowledge, no study has been performed to assess the genotoxic and biochemical effects of U. tenuissima on cultured human blood cells. Therefore, in order to determine clastogenic or aneugenic effects of aqueous alga extracts the micronucleus assay was carried out. Nuclear division index (NDI) in peripheral lymphocytes was also analyzed for cytotoxicity evaluations. In addition, biochemical parameters (total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and total oxidative stress (TOS)) were examined to determine oxidative effects. For this aim, we obtained heparinized blood samples from three healthy persons. The alga samples were collected from Porsuk Pond in Hasankale (Erzurum, Turkey) in summer period of the year 2010. The aqueous extracts of this species were added to cultures at different concentrations (0 to 5000 ppm) for 72 h. Our results showed that this alga did not cause any statistically important changes in the rates of studied genotoxicity endpoint. But dose-dependent alterations were observed in TAC and TOS levels and NDI rates. In conclusion, U. tenuissima was found to be non-genotoxic but caused sterility at higher concentrations due to oxidative stress.					; Aydın Karataş, Elanur/AGD-2545-2022; aslan, ali/AAL-9580-2020; Türkez, Hasan/AAQ-4905-2020	aslan, ali/0000-0002-5122-6646; Dirican, Ebubekir/0000-0001-9260-5223; 													0748-2337	1477-0393				MAR	2012	28	2					147	151		10.1177/0748233711407957	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0748233711407957								21632573					WOS:000300222800007
J	Eimers, MC; Dillon, PJ; Watmough, SA				Eimers, MC; Dillon, PJ; Watmough, SA			Long-term (18-year) changes in sulphate concentrations in two Ontario headwater lakes and their inflows in response to decreasing deposition and climate variations	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES					Conference on Interrelationships between Atmospheric Deposition and Landscape Features of Forest Catchments in Regulating Surface Water Biogeochemistry	MAY 29-JUN 02, 2001	Boston, MA	Amer Geophys Union				Sulphate concentrations in two headwater lakes and their major inflows were evaluated over an 18 year period (1980-81 to 1997-98) during which time sulphate bulk deposition declined by approximately 40%. The two lake catchments represent either end of the spectrum of acid sensitivity in the Muskoka-Haliburton region of Ontario. Between 1980 and 1998, sulphate concentrations in Harp and Plastic Lakes decreased, but the decrease was much less than expected (28% and 21% respectively) given the magnitude of change in deposition. Sulphate export in streams draining into the lakes greatly exceeded sulphate input to catchments in most years, which quantitatively explains the response of lake-sulphate concentration. Furthermore, temporal patterns in mean annual sulphate concentrations in streams were similar, and appeared to be related to climate factors. Specifically, catchment export of sulphate was greater and stream-sulphate concentrations were higher in years that had warm, dry summers, i.e. when streamflow in many catchments ceased for up to several weeks. Increased sulphate export from catchments resulted in higher sulphate concentrations in lakes, but the response of lake sulphate was not as immediate or dramatic as the response of stream sulphate to changes in catchment dryness. Factors that affect sulphate retention or export in catchments exert a strong influence on sulphate concentrations in lakes and streams and need to be considered when evaluating the response of surface water chemistry to changes in sulphate deposition.

Our apparatus, a gas chromatograph coupled to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (GCIRMS), runs in a quasi-automated mode and is able to analyze about 50 water samples per day. The whole procedure (sample preparation, CO2(g)-CO2(aq) equilibration time and GCIRMS analysis) requires 2 days. It consists of injecting an aliquot of water into a H3PO4-loaded and He-flushed 12 mL glass tube. The H3PO4 reacts with the water and converts the DIC into aqueous and gaseous CO2. After a CO2(g)-CO2(aq) equilibration time of between 15 and 24 h, a portion of the headspace gas (mainly CO2+He) is introduced into the GCIRMS, to measure the carbon isotope ratio of the released CO2(g), from which the delta C-13(DIC) is determined via a calibration procedure. For standard solutions with DIC concentrations ranging from 1 to 25 mmol (.) L-1 and solution volume of 1 mL (high DIC concentration samples) or 5 mL (low DIC concentration samples), delta C-13(DIC) Values are determined with a precision (1 sigma) better than 0.1 parts per thousand. Compared with previously published headspace equilibration methods, the major improvement presented here is the development of a calibration procedure which takes the carbon isotope fractionation associated with the CO2(g)-CO2(aq) partition into account: the set of standard solutions and samples has to be prepared and analyzed with the same 'gas/liquid' and 'H3PO4/water' volume ratios. A set of natural water samples (lake, river and hydrothermal springs) was analyzed to demonstrate the utility of this new method. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

We investigated the relationship between canopy feedbacks and microsite heterogeneity as they affect conifer regeneration in two Minnesotan mixed species forests: Abies balsamea (L.) Miller-Populus tremuloides Michx and Thuja occidentalis L.-Betula papyrifera Marshall, Objectives were to examine (i) microtopographic differences resulting from canopy feedbacks and (ii) conifer regeneration at three stages (seed dispersal, germination and establishment). We quantified seed rain and surveyed microtopography and regeneration of T. occidentalis and A. balsamea. Microtopographic features included pits, mounds, stumps, logs, and level ground. Differences in microtopography beneath deciduous and conifer canopy types were generally minor. Conifer seeds fell in larger numbers under conifer canopy types than under adjacent hardwood canopy types in both forest types, but substantial seed rain occurred up to 20 m into hardwood canopy patches. In the Thuja-Betula stands, both germinants and seedlings of T. occidentalis occurred almost entirely under the Thuja canopy type, and there predominantly on decayed wood (rotting stumps and logs), which occupied only a small fraction of the forest floor. In the Abies-Populus stands, A. balsamea germinants and seedlings were relatively common beneath both canopy types and on all microtopographic features. The distribution of T. occidentalis was more restricted than that of A. balsamea, indicating that A. balsamea may be more of a generalist.

The study area falls between the lower Hunter river mouth to the south (Newcastle) and Cape Hawke Harbour in Wallis Lake to the north (Forster Tuncurry). Field campaigns preceded the remote sensing survey. The geological structure and the physiography of the area are controlled by folds which tend from due north to N40 degrees W; the resistance of the carboniferous and Permian strata to erosion determines the coastal landforms of quaternary age. Several eolian, erosive and cumulative coastal landforms can be recognized within the bedrock embayments, which are the product of fluvial, paludal, lacustrine, estuarine and marine processes. Quaternary climatic oscillations have largely determined the geomorphic progression of the area in two distinct and parallel beach ridge systems. Landsat imagery helped to identify the dimensions of the following features: (i) Hard rock headlands and volcanic outcrops that conform the turning point of embayments. (ii) Flood plain deposits, including forms such as levees, back-swamps and filled-in channels. (iii) Estuaries and deltas. (iv) Eustatic terraces, although these are found further inland from the actual coastline. (v) Coastal lagoons (locally called lakes) enclosed by barriers. Size and shape vary depending on bedrock depth and relationship to barrier system. Bathymetry, hydrology and salinity do not follow a uniform pattern throughout the lagoons. (vi) Bogs and swamps, evidencing the existence of past larger water bodies, now colonized by vegetation fringing the lagoons' inner bays or silting the low inner barrier corridors. (vii) A double barrier system of sand ridges; the inner barrier system is composed of highly podzolised Pleistocene sands while the outer barrier consists of Holocene sands. (viii) Sand spits, enclosing coastal lagoons or linking offshore rocky outcrops. Analysis methods included image geocorrection and mosaicing, atmospheric filtering, radiometric enhancement, visual interpretation, supervised classification and mapping.

Bloaters remained on or near bottom during the day. At night, bloaters were distributed throughout 30-65 m of water, depending on bottom depth, Shallowest depths of migration were not related to water temperature or incident light. Maximum distances of migration increased with increasing bottom depth. Nighttime midwater densities ranged from 0.00 to 6.61 fish/1.000 m(3) and decreased with increasing bottom depth. Comparisons of length distributions showed that migrating and nonmigrating bloaters did not differ in size. However, at most sites, daytime bottom catches collected a greater proportion of larger individuals compared with nighttime midwater or bottom catches. Mean target strengths by 5-m strata indicated that migrating bloaters did nor stratify by size in the water column at night. Overall, patterns in Frequency of empty stomachs and mean digestive state of prey indicated that a portion of the bloater population fed in the water column at night. Bloater diet composition indicated both midwater feeding and bottom feeding. In sum, although a portion of the bloater population fed in the water column at night, bloaters were not limited to feeding at this time. This research confirmed that bloaters are opportunistic feeders and did not fully support the previously proposed hypothesis that bloater vertical migration is driven by the vertically migrating macroinvertebrate the opossom shrimp Mysis relicta.																			0002-8487					MAY	1999	128	3					459	474		10.1577/1548-8659(1999)128<0459:VMANDO>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1999)128<0459:VMANDO>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000089183600006
J	Ma, ZH; Wang, YB; Zhang, ZY				Ma, Zhanghuai; Wang, Yibo; Zhang, Zhongyang			Climatic characteristics of precipitation change and its multiscale causes over Central Qinghai-Tibet Plateau	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												Regional climates have changed as a result of global warming, which has sped up cirrus circulation and altered the temporal and spatial distribution of precipitation. As climate change intensifies, the pattern of precipitation in the Hoh Xil (HX) region has changed. The dislocation of rain and heat in summer hinders ecological restoration and brings great ecological threat. And it is important to clarify the causes and scopes of the midsummer drought (MSD). In this study we highlight the causes of MSD in terms of water vapour transport, circulation structure and the related influencing factors. We found that (1) the HX region gradually entered a drying-warming process as MSD developed after 2005. (2) The change in the water vapour balance is the direct cause of MSD in the HX. (3) As a typical climate key zone, the HX is located in the transition region between the westerlies and the Indian monsoon. (4) Regional evaporation capacity is the main factor affecting the occurrence of MSD. The dominant factor shifted from being energy to water with the occurrence and enhancement of MSD. This study complements the scarce research on precipitation anomalies in the HX, provides support for clarifying the impact of climate change on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (TP) and contributes to understanding the trends and mechanisms of climate change over the TP under global warming.

Water Supply and Ancient Society in the Lake Balkhash Basin: Runoff Variability along the Historical Silk Road	SOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL DYNAMICS ALONG THE HISTORICAL SILK ROAD												Expansion of agricultural practices from the Fertile Crescent to China during the mid and late Holocene are believed to have shaped the early network of Silk Road routes and possibly regulated the dynamics of trade and exchange in the urban oases along the Silk Road throughout its existence. While the impacts of climate change on the Silk Road are more or less documented for the medieval period, they remain poorly understood for early history of the Silk Road, especially in Central Asia. We analyze hydroclimatic proxies derived from fluvial stratigraphy, geochronology, and tree-ring records that acted on various time scales in the Lake Balkhash Basin to learn how changes in water supply could have influenced the early farmers in the Semirechye region of southern Kazakhstan. Our approach aims to identify short-term and long-term variability of regional runoff and to compare the hydrological data with cultural dynamics coupled with the archaeological settlement pattern and agricultural production. The reconstructed runoff variability underscore the contribution of winter precipitation driven by the interaction between the Arctic oscillation and the Siberian High-Pressure System, to Central Asian river discharge. We show that Saka people of the Iron Age employed extensive ravine agriculture on the alluvial fans of the Tian Shan piedmont, where floodwater farming peaked between 400 BC and 200 BC. The early Silk Road farmers on the alluvial fans favored periods of reduced flood flows, river stability and glacier retreat in the Tian Shan Mountains. Moreover, they were able to apply simple flow control structures to lead water across the fan surface. It is very unlikely that changes in water supply ever significantly constricted agricultural expansion in this region.

Naveed; Beltrami, Hugo; Caya, Daniel			Projected changes to high temperature events for Canada based on a regional climate model ensemble	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												Extreme hot spells can have significant impacts on human society and ecosystems, and therefore it is important to assess how these extreme events will evolve in a changing climate. In this study, the impact of climate change on hot days, hot spells, and heat waves, over 10 climatic regions covering Canada, based on 11 regional climate model (RCM) simulations from the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program for the June to August summer period is presented. These simulations were produced with six RCMs driven by four Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCM), for the A2 emission scenario, for the current 1970-1999 and future 2040-2069 periods. Two types of hot days, namely HD-1 and HD-2, defined respectively as days with only daily maximum temperature (Tmax) and both Tmax and daily minimum temperature (Tmin) exceeding their respective thresholds (i.e., period-of-record 90th percentile of Tmax and Tmin values), are considered in the study. Analogous to these hot days, two types of hot spells, namely HS-1 and HS-2, are identified as spells of consecutive HD-1 and HD-2 type hot days. In the study, heat waves are defined as periods of three or more consecutive days, with Tmax above 32 A degrees C threshold. Results suggest future increases in the number of both types of hot days and hot spell events for the 10 climatic regions considered. However, the projected changes show high spatial variability and are highly dependent on the RCM and driving AOGCM combination. Extreme hot spell events such as HS-2 type hot spells of longer duration are expected to experience relatively larger increases compared to hot spells of moderate duration, implying considerable heat related environmental and health risks. Regionally, the Great Lakes, West Coast, Northern Plains, and Maritimes regions are found to be more affected due to increases in the frequency and severity of hot spells and/or heat wave characteristics, requiring more in depth studies for these regions to facilitate appropriate adaptation measures.

J	Natsagdorj, L; Jugder, D; Chung, YS				Natsagdorj, L; Jugder, D; Chung, YS			Analysis of dust storms observed in Mongolia during 1937-1999	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Climatology of dust storms in Mongolia is compiled based on observational data of 49 meteorological stations from 1960 to 1999 and compared them with data between 1937 and 1989. Three different maps of the distribution of dust storms, drifting dust and the number of dusty days are presented. The results of the analysis show that the number of days with dust storms is < 5 days over the Altai, the Khangai and the Khentei mountainous regions and more than 2037 days in the Gobi Desert and semi-desert area. The greatest occurrence of drifting dust arises around the Mongol Els area of west Mongolia. The number of dusty days, which is derived from the sum of the number of days with dust storms and drifting dust, is < 10 days in the mountainous area and 61-127 days in the Gobi Desert and the Great Lakes hollow of west Mongolia. It is found that 61% of dust storms occur in the spring in Mongolia and a dust storm lasts on average from 3.1 to 6.0h. About 65.5-91.0% of dust storms occur in daytime and 9.0-34.5% at night. Dust storms occur more frequently in the city region and are accompanied by surface wind speeds usually from 6 to 20 ms(-1). Dust storms usually occur when soil and air are dry, and 70% of dust storms occur in dry soil conditions. When dust storms occur, relative humidity averages 20-40% in Mongolia. An important outcome of this study is the trend of dusty days between 1960 and 1999. It shows that the number of dusty days has tripled from the 1960s to 1990s and has decreased since 1990.

J	Belzile, L; Guay, JC				Belzile, Louis; Guay, Jean-Christophe			Effectiveness of an ecological flow regime to assure successful recruitment of anadromous Coregoninae populations in the Rupert River (northern Quebec, Canada)	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												ObjectiveAs part of a large-scale hydroelectric project, the mean annual flow of the Rupert River (northern Quebec, Canada) was reduced by 52% at its mouth in 2009. To protect fish habitat, an ecological flow regime that was modulated according to the biological seasons was implemented downstream from the diversion point. An 8-year monitoring program, including 2 years before partial diversion, was carried out to verify the effectiveness of this mitigation measure on the total annual abundance of anadromous Coregoninae (Cisco Coregonus artedi and Lake Whitefish C. clupeaformis) larvae, which was used as biological indicator of recruitment success. The monitoring also aimed to determine the effects of flow modification on the timing of the larval drift and the spatial distribution of larvae in a river cross section.MethodsEach year, sampling consisted of installing drift nets during the entire downstream larval migration in a river cross section of the lower Rupert River. Drift nets were systematically placed to ensure representative sampling of the river section.ResultPrior to flow reduction, the estimated total number of larvae varied between 1.8 and 8.6 million. Over the following 6 years, the estimated larval population has remained steady at 3-4 million. Otherwise, larval drift characteristics have not changed since the flow reduction, as (1) the duration of the larval drift is the same as before, about 1 month in May and early June, with a peak period of about 8 days; (2) rise in water temperature in spring is a determining factor in the timing of larval drift; and (3) the larvae drift mainly near the surface of the water.ConclusionThe monitoring results indicate that the ecological flow regime implemented in the Rupert River was adequate to maintain anadromous coregonine populations. The establishment of a ecological flow regime has ensured the successful recruitment of anadromous Cisco and Lake Whitefish populations in the Rupert River (northern Quebec, Canada), the flow of which has been partially diverted for hydroelectric purposes.Impact statement																			0002-8487	1548-8659				JUL	2024	153	4					422	437		10.1002/tafs.10463	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tafs.10463		MAR 2024											WOS:001176165600001
J	O'Brien, KR; Ivey, GN; Hamilton, DP; Waite, AM; Visser, PM				O'Brien, KR; Ivey, GN; Hamilton, DP; Waite, AM; Visser, PM			Simple mixing criteria for the growth of negatively buoyant phytoplankton	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Phytoplankton population dynamics are controlled by the relative rather than absolute timescales of mixing, growth, and loss processes such as sedimentation, grazing, and so on. Here, the vertical distribution and biomass of phytoplankton populations are quantified by two timescale ratios: the Peclet number Pe the ratio of mixing and sedimentation timescales-and the growth number G the ratio of sedimentation and net growth timescales. Three mixing regimes are defined for phytoplankton and other particles. For Pe greater than or equal to 100, the population is translated linearly down the water column over time and will leave the surface mixing layer completely after sedimentation time 7, For 0.1<Pe<100, the population distribution depends on the relative magnitude of Pe and G. Finally, for Pe less than or equal to 0.1. the population will be vertically uniform, and biomass changes exponentially over time with characteristic timescale tau(g)=tau/(G-1). This analysis is valid for negatively buoyant phytoplankton, except when mixing time is much longer than growth time and Pe less than or equal to 0.1, which can occur for very slow sinking species. These regimes can be used for assessing the effect of changes in the mixing, growth, or sedimentation conditions on population dynamics. Published data from a lake and diurnally stratified river weir pool are used here to verify a minimum thermocline depth hypothesis proposed by others. Mixing and growth regimes are used to calculate minimum mixing depth h(nun) and to determine phytoplankton sinking rates from published sediment trap data.

Adult perch stock size failed to increase because of accelerated mortality after the first fall of life. Increases in mortality coincided with a number of ecosystem changes including increased abundance of double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus). Otoliths obtained from cormorant pellets collected on Little Galloo Island were used to examine the size and age of perch consumed by cormorants during 1993 to 1994 and 1996 to 1999. Size and age specific diet composition, combined with existing estimates of yellow perch consumed annually by cormorants were compared to perch population projections to evaluate the potential for this new form of predation to induce observed population trends. Perch stock abundance was projected using a range of standing stock estimates front the literature partitioned with age composition data front the eastern basin population. The total length of perch consumed by cormorants ranged from 59 to 236 mm, the majority of which were age-1 (48%), age-2 (20%), and age-3 (20%). Comparisons of age structured predation by cormorants and perch population projections indicated that cormorant predation reduced age-3 perch abundance most. At a high estimate of 65 kg/ha, cormorants it,ere capable of consuming 29% of the age-3 perch stock. This analysis indicated that cormorant predation had the potential to play an important role in regulating perch population levels in the eastern basin during the 1990s.																			0380-1330						2002	28	2					202	211		10.1016/S0380-1330(02)70577-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(02)70577-7													WOS:000176424300009
J	Kaas, H; Henriksen, P				Kaas, H; Henriksen, P			Saxitoxins (PSP toxins) in Danish lakes	WATER RESEARCH												occurrence of neurotoxic cyanobacteria and saxitoxins in Danish lakes was investigated from 104 phytoplankton samples representing 96 localities. Mouse bioassays demonstrated neurotoxicity in 11 localities (13 samples) of which eight (10 samples) contained saxitoxins and the remaining three anatoxin-a(s). The common cyanobacterial neurotoxin anatoxin-a was not detected. The toxin profiles of the samples containing saxitoxins were characterised using standards of saxitoxin (STX), decarbamoyl STX (dcSTX): neoSTX and gonyautoxins 1-5 (GTX1-5). Presence of C-toxins was not investigated. The lakes fell into two groups, in seven lakes STX was the dominant toxin and in four lakes GTX4 was dominant. In the first group, STX comprised 46-100% of the total toxin content; in the latter, GTX4 made up 40-75%. The total toxin content varied between 5.9 and 224.1 mu g STX equivalents g DW-1 with median at 34.1 mu g STX equivalents g DW-1. Two lakes contained more than 100 mu g STX equivalents g DW-1 (182.5 and 224.1 mu g, respectively) with STX constituting more than 95% of the total toxin content. Nine of the neurotoxic samples also contained microcystins. Most of the samples were totally dominated by cyanobacteria but unambiguous identification of toxin-producing species was not possible. Anabaena lemmermannii P. Richter was very common in the neurotoxic lakes, and it was distinctly dominant in the two lakes with the highest total contents of saxitoxins. The high frequency of neurotoxic lakes with saxitoxins suggests that these toxins are more common in fresh waters than previously assumed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Spatial distribution of introduced brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis (Salmonidae) within alpine lakes: evidences from a fish eradication campaign	EUROPEAN ZOOLOGICAL JOURNAL												Brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis have been used worldwide to stock fishless alpine lakes, negatively affecting native biota. Understanding its spatial ecology in invaded ecosystems can provide information to interpret and contrast its ecological impact. We opportunistically used capture points of brook trout gillnetted during an eradication campaign to assess the distribution patterns of four unexploited populations inhabiting high-altitude lakes. The main eradication method implies the use of many gillnets with several mesh sizes, which are selective for different fish sizes. For each lake we drew six capture maps associated with as many different mesh sizes, and we tested whether the distance from the coastline (which in alpine lakes is a reliable proxy of the most important spatial gradients, e.g. depth, temperature, prey availability, lighting conditions) influences the proportion of captured fish belonging to different size classes and the number of fish captured by the nets with different mesh sizes. To interpret the results, we also provide a cartographic description of the lakes' bathymetry and littoral microhabitats. We found (1) a negative relationship between brook trout distribution and the distance from the coastline in all of the size classes, lakes and mesh sizes; (2) that large brook trout can thrive in the lakes' center, while small ones are limited to the littoral areas; and (3) that the distance from the coastline alone cannot explain all the differences in the catch densities in different parts of the lakes. As in their native range, introduced brook trout populations also have littoral habits. Microhabitats, prey availability and distance from the spawning ground are other likely factors determining the distribution patterns of brook trout populations introduced in alpine lakes. The obtained results also provide useful information on how to plan new eradication campaigns.					; Tiberti, Rocco/AAM-7103-2021	Tiberti, Rocco/0000-0003-1617-8826; Rolla, Matteo/0000-0003-4045-8289; Nelli, Luca/0000-0001-6091-4072; 													2475-0263						2017	84	1					73	88		10.1080/11250003.2016.1274436	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11250003.2016.1274436													WOS:000407954100008
J	Uri, ND; Lewis, JA				Uri, ND; Lewis, JA			Agriculture and the dynamics of soil erosion in the United States	JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE												Soil erosion has both on-farm and off-farm impacts. Reduction of soil depth can impair the land's productivity, and the transport of sediments can degrade streams, lakes, and estuaries. To address this problem, soil conservation policies have existed in the United States for over 60 years. Initially, these policies focused on the on-farm benefits of keeping soil on the land and increasing net farm income. Beginning in the 1980s, however, policy goals increasingly included reductions in off-site impacts of erosion. The Food Security Act of 1985 was the first major legislation explicitly to tie eligibility to receive agricultural program payments to conservation performance. The Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act (FAIR) of 1996 modifies the conservation compliance provisions by providing farmers with greater flexibility in developing and implementing conservation plans. As a consequence of conservation efforts, total soil erosion between 1982 and 1997 was reduced by 42 percent and the erosion rate fell from 8.0 tons per acre per year in 1982 to 5.2 tons per acre per year in 1997. Still, soil erosion is imposing substantial social costs. In 1997 these costs are estimated to have been about $29,700,000,000. To further reduce soil erosion and thereby mitigate its social costs, there are a number of policy options available to induce farmers to adopt conservation practices including education and technical assistance, financial assistance, research and development, land retirement, and regulation and taxes.																			1044-0046						1999	14	2-3					63	82		10.1300/J064v14n02_07	http://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J064v14n02_07													WOS:000082053600006
J	STAHL, JB				STAHL, JB			BLACK WATER AND 2 PECULIAR TYPES OF STRATIFICATION IN AN ORGANICALLY LOADED STRIP-MINE LAKE	WATER RESEARCH												During summer stratification a strip-mine lake in which fish were cultured in floating cages developed black water in its anoxic zone. The blackness was evidently produced by ferrous sulfide. Two types of black water stratification were observed. In one the blackness occurred throughout the anoxic zone but was more intense in the upper part; Fe and alkalinity were high throughout this zone. In the 2nd the black water was confined to a meter-thick stratum within the anoxic zone; Fe and alkalinity were remarkably low except in 2 strata: the one with black water and the one at the top of the anoxic zone. Both types of stratification may be caused by a high rate of sulfide production in the metalimnion. The relatively high temperature there (as compared to the hypolimnion) and the presumably higher concentrations of organic matter and ammonia, resulting from fish food and fish wastes, would account for this high rate of sulfide production. Because of sharp O2 stratification 2 carbonate-forming processes, photosynthesis and sulfate reduction, occurred in close proximity to each other. In especially calm weather vertical density currents could be initiated by the calcium carbonate crystals and produce the 2nd type of stratification. If the 2nd type of stratification could be produced at will it might be used to improve the quality of strip-mine lake water.																			0043-1354	1879-2448					1979	13	5					467	471		10.1016/0043-1354(79)90040-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(79)90040-X													WOS:A1979GU68400008

Assessment of radionuclide dispersion and radiation dose for a hypothetical VVER-1200 accident in Zimbabwe	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY												The potential introduction of a VVER-1200 nuclear reactor in Zimbabwe to meet the growing energy demands requires a thorough understanding of its radiological safety and environmental impacts. To address this concern, a detailed simulation and analysis was conducted for a hypothetical VVER-1200 nuclear reactor at Lake Kariba, focusing on a design basis loss of coolant accident (LOCA). The study utilized site-specific meteorological data for both the wet and dry seasons to model the dispersion of radioactive materials using the RASCAL 4.3.4 code. The health effects of the radiological accident were quantified using dosimetric quantities, specifically the Total Effective Dose Equivalent (TEDE) and Child Thyroid Committed Effective Dose (CTCED), which are crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of emergency mitigation actions such as evacuation, sheltering-in-place, and the administration of prophylactic potassium iodide (KI) as a thyroid blocking agent. The results revealed that the doses during the wet season were approximately three times higher than those in the dry season, with the maximum TEDE reaching 153 mSv at 0.16 km from the release point during the wet season, compared to 45.5 mSv during the dry season under the containment leakage release pathway. The study also showed that both TEDE and CTCED were significantly higher near the release point and decreased as the distance downwind increased. Beyond a radius of 16.09 km (10 miles) from the release point, doses fell below 1 mSv, making this region safe for the public except under the worst-case scenario during the wet season, where doses as high as 50.2 mSv were observed at the 16.09 km distance. These findings underline the need for robust emergency preparedness and response plans, tailored to the specific climatic conditions of the region. The study provides critical baseline data that can assist decision-makers and regulators in developing regulations and guidelines to ensure adequate protection of the public and the environment in the event of a radiological accident.																			0306-4549	1873-2100				DEC 15	2025	224								111733	10.1016/j.anucene.2025.111733	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anucene.2025.111733													WOS:001548107800001

Characterizations of the modified CS have been investigated by means of FESEM images, FT-IR spectra and surface charge analysis. A new functional group, i.e., nitric ether (-O-NO2) is introduced onto the HNO3-modified CS, which is favorable for the adsorption of Cu2+. The abundant negative charges on the surface of the modified CS also provide great potential for the retention of Cu2+ on its surface. The maximum retention of Cu2+ ions is obtained under the pH range of 4.0-7.0, corresponding to a theoretical maximum adsorption capacity of 95.7 mg g(-1). The adsorbed Cu2+ is then quantitatively eluted using a 1.5 mol L-1 nitric acid solution with detection by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). With a sample volume of 30 mL, an enrichment factor of 39 and a precision of 1.6% RSD (40 mu g L-1, n = 11) are achieved. The concentration of Cu2+ could be accurately quantified within a linear range of 1-120 mu g L-1 and with a detection limit (3 sigma) of 0.35 mu g L-1. The present procedure is validated by analyzing a certified reference material of Trace Elements in Water (GBW(E) 080039). It is further applied to determine copper by spiking recovery tests in tap water, spring water, snow meltwater, lake water, river water and an electroplating water sample, giving rise to spiking recoveries in the range of 96.8-103.0%.

The survey was designed to quantify the number of lakes with surface area greater than 4 ha that are acidic or that have low acid neutralizing capacity (ANC). The largest estimated number (102) and percentage (9.8%) of acidic lakes (ANC .ltoreq. 0) in the upper Midwest were found in the upper peninsula of Michigan. There were an estimated 45 acidic lakes in northcentral Wisconsin, representing 3% of the target lakes, and the highest percentage (41.4%) of low ANC (.ltoreq. 50 .mu.equiv/L) lakes was also observed in this area. No acidic lakes were sampled in the remaining portions of Minnesota, Wisconsin, or Michigan. Sulfate concentrations, relatively low compared to those in portions of the Northeast, were greatest in the upper peninsula of Michigan and were intermediate in northeastern Minnesota. Acidic lakes had low concentrations of major base cations and high sulfate concentrations and were most common in areas receiving greatest acidic deposition. The strong relationship of lake chemistry to the depositional gradient of hydrogen ions and the relatively modest concentrations of DOC in acidic lakes, coupled with the predominance of sulfate in these lakes, provide support for the hypothesis that some lakes in the upper Midwest have been acidified by acidic deposition.																			0013-936X	1520-5851				FEB	1988	22	2					164	172		10.1021/es00167a005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es00167a005								19995016					WOS:A1988L911800011

A mid- to late-Holocene record of vegetation decline and erosion triggered by monsoon weakening and human adaptations in the south-east Indian Peninsula	HOLOCENE												The mid- to late-Holocene monsoon decline led to aridification of the Indian Peninsula impacting the early agricultural practices in the region. Our analysis of organic carbon, mineral magnetic properties and AMS C-14 dating of a 54.2-m-long sediment core (CY) from the Godavari Delta, India, showed changes in the organic carbon source and sediment provenance, which are linked to the changes in vegetation and soil/rock erosion caused by widespread aridification and associated human adaptation in central India. Our results show a decline in the concentration of ferrimagnetic minerals, indicating reduced input from the basalts of the Deccan Plateau after similar to 6.0 cal. ka BP in response to the weaker Indian monsoon. C-13 values show a distinct increase from similar to 4.9 cal. ka BP, indicating an increase in C4 plant sources under the continued weak monsoon phase, whereas a higher ferrimagnetic mineral concentration in the sediment suggested an increased Deccan basalt source. Abrupt increase in C-13 values and decrease in TOC content accompanied with a significant increase in ferrimagnetic mineral concentration from similar to 3.2 to 3.1 cal. ka BP reflected a shift of organic carbon and sediment source and a severe decline in vegetation coverage. Such phenomena indicate intensified deforestation and soil/rock erosion in the Deccan Plateau producing higher ferrimagnetic mineral inputs, which is in agreement with significant expansion of agricultural activities in the Deccan Chalcolithic cultural period. In addition, C3 plants recovered and magnetic concentration declined during the wet events (4.6 and 4.0 cal. ka BP) of Neolithic time, while both C3 plants and magnetic parameters increased during the wet events (3.1-2.8 and 2.1 cal. ka BP) of the Chalcolithic cultural period. This implies increased agricultural activity and the onset of human modification of the ecosystem.

J	Parry, WT; Forster, CB; Solomon, DK; James, LP				Parry, WT; Forster, CB; Solomon, DK; James, LP			Ownership of mine-tunnel discharge	GROUND WATER												Water discharging from numerous tunnels constructed during mining in the Wasatch Mountains near Salt Lake City, Utah, flows into nearby creeks, Disputes over ownership of water feeding the creeks have resulted in extensive litigation. In the course of a legal dispute over ownership of outflow from the Kentucky-Utah (K-U) Tunnel we evaluated the patterns and rates of ground water flow using an integrated study of the geology, chemistry, isotopes, and chlorofluorohydrocarbon (CFC) composition of the water. A sequence of sedimentary rocks with a range of hydraulic conductivity values has been folded, faulted, intruded by igneous rocks, and then eroded to create the rough topography of the Wasatch Mountains. The similarity of composition among tunnel discharge, springs, and base flow in the creek indicates that the creek is fed by ground water circulating in local, shallow flow systems. Results of numerical simulations of ground water flow indicate that the K-U Tunnel likely intercepts ground water that, in the absence of the tunnel, would ultimately flow in the subsurface to Big Cottonwood Creek. CFC and tritium contents of the water indicate flow weighted average ground water travel times range from four to 23 years and support our conclusion that water discharging from the tunnel is moving within a shallow ground water flow system. Despite sparse data, the scientific understanding was deemed sufficient for the judge to rule that owners of the surface water also own the tunnel discharge because, in the absence of the tunnel, this water would supply the stream.

The study sites are in an area with low human impact and range from boreal forest to alpine tundra. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) constrained to mean July air temperature and pH clearly showed that diatom community composition was different between lakes situated in conifer-, mountain birch- and alpine-vegetation zones. As a consequence, diatoms and multivariate ordination methods can be used to infer past changes in treeline position and dominant forest type. Quantitative inference models were developed to estimate mean July air temperature, pH and TOC from sedimentary diatom assemblages using weighted averaging (WA) and weighted averaging partial least squares (WA-PLS) regression. Relationships between diatoms and mean July air temperature were independent of lake-water pH, TOC, alkalinity and maximum depth. The results demonstrated that diatoms in lake sediments can provide useful and independent quantitative information for estimating past changes in mean July air temperature (R-jack(2) = 0.62, RMSEP = 0.86 degrees C; R-2 and root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) based on jack-knifing), pH (R(j)(2)ack = 0.61, RMSEP = 0.30) and TOC (R-jack(2) = 0.49, RMSEP = 1.33 mg l(-1)). The paper focuses mainly on the relationship between diatom community composition and mean July air temperature, but the relationships to pH and TOC are also discussed.					; Hall, Roland/K-3165-2019	Hall, Roland/0000-0002-0314-6449; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				AUG	2000	24	2					109	123		10.1023/A:1008128014721	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1008128014721													WOS:000088036400001
J	Li, QY; McGowran, B				Li, QY; McGowran, B			Miocene climatic oscillation recorded in the Lakes Entrance oil shaft, southern Australia: Benthic foraminiferal response on a mid-latitude margin	MICROPALEONTOLOGY												The Lakes Entrance oil shaft section in east Gippsland, southeastern Australia, spans most of the second-order rise and fall in sea level and climate known as the Miocene oscillation. For this section, we have established time series of taxic changes and relative abundances of benthic foraminifera. Metrics reflecting the Miocene oscillation are changes in the profiles of inner, middle and outer neritic species, infauna and epifauna, and first and last appearances of species, as well as the numerous intervening comings and goings. A paleodepth curve is derived from shifts in the dominance of ecological groups. The inferred pattern of transgression/regression shows good agreement with third-order sequences. The pattern of first and last appearances shows three levels of particular interest. Two major changes are close by correlation to second-order sequence boundaries, early in the early Miocene and at the middle/late Miocene boundary respectively. Whereas the planktonic succession peaks in all measures at the Miocene optimum, the equivalent but muted benthic peaking leads it by some 2 m.y., peaking at the beginning of the Monterey carbon excursion. Thus the neritic record is more in tune with the deep-ocean record than with the plankton, and we suggest that fluctuations in nutrient supply had their major impact on the rising side (early Miocene) of the Miocene oscillation.																			0026-2803					SUM	1997	43	2					149	164		10.2307/1485779	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1485779													WOS:A1997XJ72100003
J	Laurenz, L; Lüdecke, HJ; Lüning, S				Laurenz, Ludger; Luedecke, Horst-Joachim; Luning, Sebastian			Influence of solar activity changes on European rainfall	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS												European hydroclimate shows a high degree of variability on every time scale. The variability is controlled by natural processes such as Atlantic ocean cycles, changes in solar activity, volcanic eruptions and anthropogenic factors. This contribution concentrates on the solar influence on European precipitation, a relationship which has been documented by a large body of published case studies. Here we are concentrating on the period 1901-2015 for which we compare sunspot data with monthly precipitation series of 39 European countries by calculating Pearson correlation coefficients for a multi-year cross-correlation window. The coefficients have been mapped out across Europe with the aim to identify areas in which solar activity may have influenced precipitation. Results show that February precipitation in Central and Western Europe yields the strongest solar response with coefficients reaching up to + 0.61. Rainfall in June July is equally co-driven by solar activity changes, whereby the solar-influenced zone of rainfall shifts from the British Isles towards Eastern Europe during the course of summer. Other months with noteworthy solar responses are April, May and December. On a decadal scale, the correlation between precipitation and solar activity in central Europe appears to be mostly positive, both statistically and by visual curve comparison. Yet, best positive correlations coefficients of February, June, July and December are typically reached when the solar signal lags rainfall by 1.5-2 years. Taking into account cause and effect, it is suspected that increases in Central European rainfall are actually triggered by the solar minimum some 3-4 years before the rainfall month, rather than the lagging solar maximum. Similar lags of a few years occur between solar activity and the solar-synchronized North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) due to memory effects in the Atlantic. The literature review demonstrates that most multi-decadal studies from Central Europe encountered a negative correlation between solar activity and rainfall, probably because short time lags of a few years are negligible on timescales beyond the 11 year solar Schwabe cycle. Flood frequency typically increases during times of low solar activity associated with NAO- conditions and more frequent blocking.

J	Chlachula, J				Chlachula, J			Late Pleistocene environments and Palaeo-American occupation of southwestern Alberta, Canada	ANTHROPOLOGIE												Geological and archaeological investigations carried out between 1990-1994 at two Palaeo-American sites in the Bow River valley, southwestern Alberta, have provided evidence that prehistoric people occupied the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains prior to the last glaciation. The cultural material consists of two series of formally identical stone tool assemblages recorded from stratigraphically superimposed and deeply buried Late Pleistocene geological contexts. At Site 1 (Varsity Estates), lithic artifacts have been found redeposited in a Cordilleran (the Bow Valley) till, and in situ excavated on the gravelly till surface at the base of thick glaciolacustrine sediments. At Site 2 (Silver Springs), an earlier lithic assemblage has been recorded from the basal part of the same till and in underlying fluvial gravels. The cultural status of both lithic collections is clearly manifested by patterned artifact-diagnostic flaking attributes, which radically differ from randomly modified clasts from local glacial and fluvial settings. Identical edge-retouch is encountered in the Old World Palaeolithic, as well as in local postglacial core and flake industries produced on similar lithic raw materials (mainly quartzite). Simple, direct-percussion was the dominant flaking technique in both collections. A few pieces exhibit a rudimentary prepared-core technology; soft-hammer percussion flaking was applied on some cores with one flaking platform. The typology is dominated by a variety of crudely modified core and flake tools, including unifacial and bifacial choppers, simple bifaces, and large unifacially retouched side scrapers produced on cobbles by anvil-percussion technique. Flake tools occur mostly in the form of transverse and lateral side scrapers; carinate endscrapers, denticulates, notches, simple dihedral and other burins, utilized flakes and unmodified debitage represent the remainder of the flake component. Both lithic assemblages manifest general similarities with Late Pleistocene Palaeolithic industries from northeastern Eurasia. Temporal placement of the artifact assemblages is based on the chronostratigraphy of the industry-bearing deposits in the context of the regional glacial history. Two periods of Palaeolithic occupation are assumed. The earlier settlement is documented by the lower series lithic industry from Site 2 (Silver Springs), where artifacts were distributed on top of fluvial gravels later partly distorted by the Bow Valley glacier, advancing from the Rocky Mountains, and subsequently buried by 5-10 m of glacial diamicton (till) deposits. The later settlement relates to the upper series lithic industry assemblage excavated on the Bow Valley till surface beneath ca. 24 m of Glacial Lake Calgary sediments that accumulated when the river was dammed by the continental (Laurentides) ice-sheet during its maximum advance into the Calgary area. A final Mid- and early Late Wisconsinan (Wurmian/Weichselian) age, respectively, is assumed for both artifact assemblages (ca. 25 000-21 000 BP) probably separated by a relatively short time period from each other. Palynological and contextual data suggest a moderately cold climate during both occupations within a parkland/steppe tundra. The gee-archaeological evidence indicates persisting ice-free conditions in the southwestern Alberta Foothills after onset of the last glacial period, and adaptation of local Palaeo-American groups to periglacial environments, who likely also occupied caves in the nearby unglaciated Rocky Mountains. The cultural record from these western Canada sites support the concept of an earlier (''pre-Palaeoindian'') settlement of North America.																			0003-5521						1996	100	1					88	131																WOS:A1996UR53700006
J	SOSTER, FM; MCCALL, PL				SOSTER, FM; MCCALL, PL			PREDATION BY COELOTANYPUS (DIPTERA, CHIRONOMIDAE) ON LABORATORY POPULATIONS OF TUBIFICID OLIGOCHAETES	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Laboratory experiments were conducted with sediments and organisms collected from Lake Erie''s western basin to examine the effect of Coelotanypus (Chironomidae: Diptera) predation on tubificid oligochaetes. Populations of predator and prey organisms were kept together in replicate laboratory microcosms at densities ranging from 2,500-12,500 predators/m2 and 12,500-62,500 prey/m2 for 15- to 30-day periods. Control populations of predators and prey were maintained separately for comparative purposes. A separate selection experiment showed that larvae preferred sediments containing tubificids or previously settled larvae over sediments that contained neither. Mortality in worm populations kept with predatory Coelotanypus larvae averaged 56.9% (S.D. = 3.9%) and was significantly higher (p < 0.001, t-test) than the 9.7% (S.D = 3.1%) average mortality in control populations. Simulated effects of chironomid burrowing and burrow irrigation did not cause increased worm mortality. An average predation rate of 0.11 (S.D. = 0.04) prey.cntdot.predator1.day-1 was calcuated from the data. Based on average Coelotanypus and tubificid densities in western Lake Erie and assuming that natural feeding rates are comparable to those in the laboratory, Coelotanypus may be capable of reducing tubificid populations by about 20% over a 2-month period during the late summer. Natural abundance data indicate that tubificid population declines are associated with periods of peak Coelotanypus density.																			0380-1330						1989	15	3					408	417		10.1016/S0380-1330(89)71496-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(89)71496-9													WOS:A1989AR71000004

We refer to the first method as Landsat, which uses Landsat images and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) responses from images acquired in multiple years to determine areal cover of Phragmites and other dominant vegetation classes. The second method, which we will call PALSAR (Phase array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar) uses radar to aid detection of water level and biomass of Phragmites and other wetland classes. We refer to the third method as SWOOP (Southwestern Ontario Orthophotography Project), which uses spring-time orthophotos and object-based image classification to map Phragmites and other features in a defined region of interest. Our last method is called UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) which involves manually delineating Phragmites in image data acquired by a UAV. The UAV method was most accurate at identifying Phragmites but could only be used to map a small area. The PALSAR approach provided a more accurate view of invasive Phragmites than did Landsat, and exceeded the SWOOP in terms of accuracy but not in terms of spatial resolution. The best choice of method to use will depend on the scope of the mapping project and available funding. Landsat and PALSAR may be most appropriate for mapping Phragmites at the regional scale, while SWOOP and AUV may be most appropriate for finer-scale updates. To fully interpret the invasion pattern of Phragmites at the scale of the Great Lakes basin, a combination of these methods may be required.

J	ABRAHAMSON, WG				ABRAHAMSON, WG			POST-FIRE RECOVERY OF FLORIDA LAKE WALES RIDGE VEGETATION	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Community responses to fire of 5 major vegetation associations of the Lake Wales Ridge were investigated during a 5-yr post-fire period. Vegetation of southern ridge sandhills, sand pine scrub, scrubby flatwoods, flatwoods and swales was sampled using permanent line transects and quadrats in both burned and unburned (control) areas. Fire passed through the mosaic of vegetation leaving a pattern of unburned and lightly to severely burned areas. There was little change in soil chemistry (pH, K, P, Mg) with the exception of a short-lived increase in Ca. Vegetation recovery rates, measured by percentage cover and Horn''s Index, were rapid. Typically, less than 2 yr was needed for recovery of poorly drained flatwoods and swale associations and 1-4 yr for better drained scrubby flatwoods and southern ridge sandhills. Species diversity (H'') increased significantly following fire at poorly drained sites due to increased evenness, but was largely unchanged at better sites. There was virtually no change in vascular plant species composition for the sprouting associations. Fire is not a succession-intiating disturbance in the Clementsian sense. The species present prior to burning either resprout soon after fire or resist fire, thus rapidly restoring the preburn conditions. Limited data suggest fire in the associations dominated by seeding species likewise does not initiate a relay type succession. The ridge vegetation exhibits marked resiliency to fire as a result of an evolutionary history of a stressful environment including winter droughts, acidic, nutrient-poor sand substrates, and frequent lightning-caused low intensity burns.																			0002-9122	1537-2197					1984	71	1					9	21		10.2307/2443618	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2443618													WOS:A1984SD99100002

A second aim of the investigation was intercalibration of sampling and phytoplankton counting techniques between the Russian and Finnish laboratories. Phytoplankton samples were collected from 27 sampling stations in the lake and from the rivers Volkhov and Neva in 9-13 August 1993. In surface water samples the phytoplankton fresh weight biomass varied in the range 218-3575 mg m(-3). Highest biomass values were encountered in Sortavala Bay, and lowest ones in the western central part of the lake. Phytoplankton species composition varied considerably in the lake; blue-green and green algae predominated near-shore areas and Cryptophyceae in the offshore stations. Canonical correspondance analysis revealed close grouping of eutrophy indicating communities, dominated mainly by greens and blue-greens, in the most nutrient-rich parts of Lake Ladoga, the Volkhov and Svir Bays. Samples from the vicinity of the inflows of Vuoksi and Burnaya Rivers and off Pitkaranta formed a separate group, dominated by diatoms, most of which were typical to mesotrophic or eutrophic lakes, As judged by phytoplankton biomass values and chlorophyll a concentrations, Lake Ladoga may generally be classified as mesotrophic. Eutrophicated areas are found in the northern archipelago of the lake and in the areas influenced by large rivers.																			0018-8158					APR 12	1996	322	1-3					9	16		10.1007/BF00031799	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00031799													WOS:A1996UT84700003
J	Anderson, RM; Hobbs, BF; Koonce, JF				Anderson, Richard M.; Hobbs, Benjamin F.; Koonce, Joseph F.			Modeling effects of forest cover reduction on larval walleye survival in Lake Erie tributary spawning basins	ECOSYSTEMS												An integrated modeling approach is used to link land use to river discharge, and then to survival of larval walleye that hatch in northern Ohio streams draining into Lake Erie (USA). First, to link land use and river discharge, the parameters of a simple hydrologic model are statistically related to watershed landscape attributes, including forest cover. One such relationship allows estimation of the change in daily river discharge that could result from a reduction in basin-scale forest cover. Second, to represent the river discharge-larval survival link, we reexamine a dataset from Mion and others to propose a relationship between daily flow velocity, water temperature, and walleye larval survival. Together, these linked models provide estimates of the reduction in larval survival due to reduction in forest cover, along with the uncertainty of those estimates. For the Grand River watershed, decreasing forest cover from 45.2 to 30% is projected to reduce average larval survival by about 45%. In the adjacent Chagrin River, dropping cover from 62.5 to 30% reduces survival by almost 60%. The greater rate of reduction of survival in the Chagrin River as forest levels fall is explained by a relatively greater increase in storm flows for the Chagrin, due to more frequently saturated soils. Therefore, forest preservation in the Chagrin River watershed is projected to be more effective in preserving walleye larval tributary habitat.

Rapid changes in the level of Kluane Lake in Yukon Territory over the last millennium	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												The level of Kluane Lake, the largest lake in Yukon Territory, was lower than at present during most of the Holocene. The lake rose rapidly in the late seventeenth century to a level 12 m above present, drowning forest and stranding driftwood on a conspicuous high-stand beach, remnants of which are preserved at the south end of the lake. Kluane Lake fell back to near its present level by the end of the eighteenth century and has fluctuated within a range of about 3 m over the last 50 yr. The primary control on historic fluctuations in take level is the discharge of Slims River, the largest source of water to the lake. We use tree ring and radiocarbon ages, stratigraphy and sub-bottom acoustic data to evaluate two explanations for the dramatic changes in the level of Kluane Lake. Our data support the hypothesis of Hugh Bostock, who suggested in 1969 that the maximum Little Ice Age advance of Kaskawulsh Glacier deposited large amounts of sediment in the Slims River valley and established the present course of Slims River into Kluane Lake. Bostock argued that these events caused the lake to rise and eventually overflow to the north. The overflowing waters incised the Duke River fan at the north end of Kluane Lake and lowered the lake to its present level. This study highlights the potentially dramatic impacts of climate change on regional hydrology during the Little Ice Age in glacierised mountains. (c) 2006 University of Washington.

J	Schwab, DJ; Eadie, BJ; Assel, RA; Roebber, PJ				Schwab, DJ; Eadie, BJ; Assel, RA; Roebber, PJ			Climatology of large sediment resuspension events in southern Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Lake Michigan, particularly the southern basin, is subject to recurrent episodes of massive sediment resuspension by storm-induced waves and currents. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the climatology of these events for Lake Michigan, including an analysis of associated meteorological conditions. This paper begins by examining turbidity records from two water treatment plants (Chicago, IL and St. Joseph, MI) for which long-term records are available. The turbidity records from the two plants show significant differences indicating that turbidity measurements from a single location would probably not be representative of a basin-wide climatology. A one-dimensional sediment resuspension and deposition model for fine-grained sediments is then developed and calibrated with data from the water treatment plants. The one-dimensional model is applied at 15 points around the southern basin for a 45-year period for which Lake Michigan wave climatology is available and the results are averaged to obtain a basin-wide turbidity index (Southern Lake Michigan Turbidity Index, SLMTI). A frequency distribution of the turbidity index is presented and meteorological conditions associated with the largest events are examined. Our analysis indicates that significant resuspension events in southern Lake Michigan are usually caused by a strong cyclone passing to the east of the lake. The most likely time of the year for this to occur is October to April. There is an average of 1 event per year with SLMTI above 25 mg/L and each event typically lasts about 3 days. Our analysis indicates that events have occurred more frequently since the late 1980s as the number of winter storms has increased and ice cover has decreased.

Oxygen-18 and deuterium analyses of water samples are provided from late summer surveys of 50 lakes with varying land cover and permafrost conditions. Six sub-groups of lakes are represented, including Stony Mountains, West Fort McMurray, Northeast Fort McMurray, Birch Mountains, Caribou Mountains and Shield. This dataset includes 1582 isotopic analyses made on 791 water samples and 3164 isotope mass balance model outputs, as well as 800 lake/watershed parameters, 5600 climate parameters, and 800 modelled values for isotopic composition of precipitation used in the computations. Model data are provided to facilitate evaluation of transferability of the model for other applications, and to permit more sophisticated spatial analysis and intercomparison with geochemical and biological datasets. Details and further discussion on the isotope mass balance approach are provided in "Regional trends in water balance and runoff to fifty boreal lakes: a 16-year isotope mass balance assessment including evaluation of hydrologic drivers" [1]. Overall, the data are expected to be useful, in comparison with local and regional datasets, for water resource management and planning, including design of monitoring networks and environmental impact assessments for oil sands projects.

Climate change and ecosystem response in the northern Columbia River basin - A paleoenvironmental perspective	ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS												A comprehensive review of Holocene paleoenvironmental data has been prepared, providing the basis for evaluating natural variability in climate and ecosystem dynamics in the northern Columbia River basin. The paleoenvironmental record reveals four major climatic shifts and a number of less well-defined climatic changes throughout the Holocene. The major climate changes are (1) a cool or cold, late-glacial climate at the end of the last glaciation (>11500 cal. year BP), (2) an interval of drought and maximum summer warmth during the early Holocene (ca. 10500 to 8000 cal. year BP), (3) a mid-Holocene trend towards a cooler, more moist climate (ca. 8000 to ca. 4000 cal. year BP), and (4) a relatively stable climate persisting from ca. 4000 cal. year BP until the arrival of European settlers. Air temperatures have warmed by about 1 degrees C over the past century. Minor climate events that are emerging as global in nature include Little Ice Age (1200-150 BP) conditions, and a late Holocene cool wet period (3500-2500 BP). These are observed in some study sites examined in this paper and may be related to large-scale cycles of 2800-2000 and 1500 years. A discussion of changing atmospheric circulation patterns, and the causes of long-term climatic change are included, together with a discussion of the implications of the paleoenvironmental record for understanding future climate, and the likely response of communities and ecosystems.

Evaluation of the operational atmospheric model used in emergency response system at Kalpakkam on the east coast of India	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												The performance of a triple-nested mesoscale atmospheric model (MM5) implemented in the Online Nuclear Emergency Response System (ONERS) at Kalpakkam on southeast coast of India is evaluated. Real-time atmospheric model predictions are used to compute radiological plume dispersion in the mesoscale ranges using Lagrangian particle models. About 280 days falling in dry and wet weather and distributed in 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 years are considered. About 25 upper air, 100 surface station data including radiosonde, GPS sonde, micrometeorological tower and automated weather stations are used for model evaluation. Results indicate that model could reproduce the synoptic pressure, geopotential heights, winds and precipitation patterns in the coarse domain as well as the fine scale features of the atmospheric circulation in the inner fine domain. Model diagnosis with observations shows correlation (r), mean absolute error (MAE) and bias as (0.685, 1.87 C. 1.28 C) for temperature, (0.93, 1.55 hPa, 0.113 hpa) for pressure, (0.56,15 m, 0.53 m) for geopotential, (0.55, 12%, -10.5%) for humidity and (0.45, 2.3 m s(-1), 1.70 m s(-1)) for wind speed indicating appreciable performance in the lower atmosphere for both dry and wet weather events. Model error in wind speed/direction reduced with height and slightly increased for temperature and humidity. Model performance is relatively better for dry weather cases than for the rainfall events. Also simulations from high resolution domain-3 are found to be better with relatively lower error metrics than those over coarse domains 1 and 2. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Jensen, FP; Falk, K; Petersen, BS				Pagh Jensen, Flemming; Falk, Knud; Svenning Petersen, Bo			Migration routes and staging areas of Abdim's Storks Ciconia abdimii identified by satellite telemetry	OSTRICH												This paper presents the results of a satellite tracking study of seven adult Abdim's Storks Ciconia abdimii that were followed from the nesting areas in southern Niger across the equator to the non-breeding range and back. Post-breeding migration started between early November and early December when all birds migrated directly to an area south of Lake Victoria in Tanzania, where they arrived between late November and early January. One bird moved to Zimbabwe for 2.5 months before returning to Tanzania; this bird returned to the same place in Zimbabwe the following year. The other tagged storks remained in northern Tanzania, suggesting that this region (at least in 2003-2004) is more important as a wintering area for the species than previously thought. While in Tanzania and Zimbabwe, most storks were almost completely stationary. Prenuptial migration started during mid-February, when one stork moved to the Central African Republic (CAR). The other storks moved to northern Uganda in mid-March and four continued into southern Sudan in mid-April, following the progression of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Final migration towards Niger started between early April and early May, when the storks returned to the nests of the previous year in mid-May, almost simultaneously with the first major rainfall. Storks from the same village differed widely in migration strategy. Post-breeding maximum migration speed was between 216km/day and 307km/day, while migration was generally faster on the last leg of the return trip to the nest, with a maximum of 456km/day.

J	Jones, RL; Keen, DH; Robinson, JE				Jones, RL; Keen, DH; Robinson, JE			Devensian Lateglacial and early Holocene floral and faunal records from NE Northumberland	PROCEEDINGS OF THE YORKSHIRE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY												Radiocarbon-dated Late Devensian and early Holocene pollen, molluscan and ostracod assemblages, from the sediments of an infilled kettle-hole lake near Wooler in north-eastern Northumberland, are described and discussed in both a local and a wider context. During the Lateglacial interstadial, open birch woodland developed for a short time after herbaceous vegetation had first dominated the surrounding landscape. Scrub was present for the remainder of the interstadial. Mollusca and Ostracoda immigrated into the lake during the pre-woodland phase of the interstadial, then disappeared, perhaps due to a climatic deterioration. A depauperate fauna returned in the latter part of the interstadial, when a less hostile aquatic environment may have existed. In the succeeding Loch Lomond Stadial, a periglacial climate led to tundra-like vegetation and to the extirpation once again of the lacustrine fauna. In the early Holocene, Betula- then Corylus-dominated woodland was preceded by scrub and heath. Mollusca and Ostracoda recolonized the water body at the start of the Holocene, with the former quickly developing a diverse fauna. Two episodes of increased lake level with an intervening fall are suggested by the faunal assemblages. The second rise in water level was accompanied by vegetation changes in its environs, which may have been linked to a wetter and cooler climate than that which preceded it, and which occurred between 8000 and 7000 BP.																			0044-0604	2041-4811				NOV	2000	53		2				97	110		10.1144/pygs.53.2.97	http://dx.doi.org/10.1144/pygs.53.2.97													WOS:000165681800002

FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												Seagrasses are the only submerged marine higher plants, which can colonize the sea through sexual (via seeds) reproduction. The transition between seed dormancy and germination is an important ecological trait and a key stage in the life cycle of higher plants. According to our observations, the seeds of Zostera marina L. (eelgrass) in Swan Lake (SL) and Qingdao Bay (QB) in northern China have the same maturation time (summer) but different germination time. To investigate this phenomenon, we further carried out reciprocal transplantation experiment and transcriptome analysis. Results revealed that differences in the seed germination time between the two sites do exist and are determined by internal molecular mechanisms as opposed to environmental factors. Furthermore, we conducted comparative transcriptome analysis of seeds at the mature and early germination stages in both locations. The results that the number of genes related to energy, hormone and cell changes was higher in SL than in QB, could account for that the dormancy depth of seeds in SL was deeper than that in QB; consequently, the seeds in SL needed to mobilize more related genes to break dormancy and start germination. The results could have important practical implications for seagrass meadow restoration via seeds and provide in-depth and comprehensive data for understanding the molecular mechanisms related to seagrass seed germination.

Spectrophotometric determination of tellurium(IV) in environmental and telluride film samples	JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												Three simple, rapid, and sensitive spectrophotometric methods for the determination of traces and ultratraces of tellurium(IV) were studied. These methods were based on either the oxidation of 4-bromophenylhydrazine (4-BPH) by tellurium in a basic medium and coupling with N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine dihydrochloride (NEDA) to give a purple-colored product, the oxidation of 3-methyl-2-benzothazoline hydrazone hydrochloride (MBTH) by tellurium in a basic medium and coupling with chromotropic acid (CA) to yield a red-colored species, or the oxidation of 2,3-dimethoxystrychnidin-10-one (2,3-DMSO) by tellurium in an acidic medium to yield an orange-colored derivative. Beer's law was obeyed in the range 1.0-25 mu g/mL (purple-colored product), 0.7-20 mu g/mL (red-colored species), and 0.3-15 mu g/mL (orange-colored derivative). The reaction conditions and other analytical parameters were investigated to enhance the sensitivity of the proposed methods. The tolerance limit of various ions has been studied. The methods were applied to the analysis of tellurium in water samples (waste, river, lake, and spring), plant materials, soil samples, and telluride thin films. The results obtained were superior to those obtained using the reported method. The performances of the proposed methods were evaluated in terms of 't'-test and variance ratio 'f'-test, which indicate the advances of the proposed methods over reported methods.

J	Warnock, N; Bishop, MA				Warnock, N; Bishop, MA			Spring stopover ecology of migrant Western Sandpipers	CONDOR												We describe stopover ecology for 132 migrant radiomarked Western Sandpipers (Calidris mauri) relocated repeatedly along the Pacific Flyway of North America. Eighty-eight percent of radiomarked birds were detected at 1-5 sites north of their banding sites, at distances ranging from 240-4,000 km away. We compare length of stay and physical indices of Western Sandpipers banded at coastal sites (San Francisco Bay, California and Grays Harbor, Washington), and an interior, western Great Basin site (Honey Lake, California). Western Sandpipers radiomarked at the interior site had significantly shorter length of stays than birds radiomarked at coastal sites, and they had significantly lower fat scores. The ephemeral nature of Great Basin stopover sites and an increased risk of predation may explain some of this variation. Fat and body condition indexes explained little of the observed variation in length of stay of Western Sandpipers at banding and other stopover sites. Length of stay of birds radiomarked at Grays Harbor were significantly longer compared to birds radiomarked to the south that also stopped at Grays Harbor, suggesting a potential capture effect on length of stay of birds at banding sites. Mean length of stays at seven sites other than banding sites ranged from 1.1-3.3 days and were not significantly affected by sex of bird, year of study, or banding location. Length of stay of male Western Sandpipers at the Copper River Delta, Alaska became significantly shorter later in the migration period, but not for females. Coastal sites along the Pacific Flyway from San Francisco to the breeding grounds generally function as stopovers for Western Sandpipers instead of staging areas.

Lake Powell, the last major impoundment built on the river, filled in 1981. Since then, flood flows in the main channel of the river have occurred in El Nino cycles, and have returned native trees and other vegetation to the riparian corridor. This vegetation provides a migration route for endangered southwestern willow flycatchers (Empidonax traillii) and other migratory birds moving from Mexico to the United States for summer nesting. Agricultural drain water from the Wellton-Mohawk Irrigation District conveyed to the delta since 1977 has created Cienega de Santa Clara, a 4200-ha Typha domengensis marsh containing the largest remaining population of the endangered Yuma clapper rail (Rallus longirostris yumanensis), plus numerous species of migratory and resident waterfowl. Populations in the marine part of the delta have been severely affected by the lack of river flow, but some species have responded positively to renewed flows. Currently, there are 170,000 ha of natural areas in the lower delta in Mexico, containing riparian, wetland and intertidal habitats. Much of this land as well as the adjacent marine zone is protected in the Biosphere Reserve of the Upper Gulf of California and Colorado River Delta. Natural resource managers, scientists and non-governmental environmental groups in Mexico and the United States are exploring conservation measures that can provide water and protection for these areas for the future.

Along the Lake on Foot: The Evacuation of the Population from Leningrad in late November and early December, 1941	NOVEISHAYA ISTORIYA ROSSII-MODERN HISTORY OF RUSSIA												This article examines the little-studied issue from the history of the civilian evacuation from Leningrad in the years of the Blockade. Drawing on diaries, memoirs, and unpublished documents, the authors analyze the emergence and realization of large groups of people traversing Lake Ladoga by foot, from the besieged city to the rest of the USSR, in late November and early December, 1941. This attempt was considered an essential characteristic of the organization of Ladoga communication at the beginning of the winter of 1941. These sources suggest the hypothesis of the existence of administrative documents from military and civil bodies that developed the idea of travel across the lake on foot. A marching order across Ladoga's ice for various groups of military personnel was employed, and the idea of mass evacuations of civilians on foot was not officially realized at this time. The authors conclude that the emergence of this idea of sending civilians who were physically and morally unprepared reveals the authorities' feverish search for ways to evacuate Leningrad's inhabitants in the face of the worsening situation with food and living conditions. Good intentions could lead to tragedy, and the general unpreparedness for mass evacuation stood in the way of this adventurous, if dangerous, project. Judging by diaries and other documents, Leningraders had one of two attitudes to this plan. Some were ready to take this risk that to flee hunger and cold, in hopes of finding rescue beyond the city, while others tried to consider forces and conditions of this journey, understanding the real danger for this form of evacuation.																			2219-9659	2309-7973					2019	9	1					56	69		10.21638/11701/spbu24.2019.103	http://dx.doi.org/10.21638/11701/spbu24.2019.103													WOS:000512909000003
J	GJESSING, ET				GJESSING, ET			THE HUMEX PROJECT - EXPERIMENTAL ACIDIFICATION OF A CATCHMENT AND ITS HUMIC LAKE	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL												Acid rain research during the late 1970s and the early 1980s concluded that acid precipitation seriously affected the environment. It was, however, realised that humic substances (HS) in the water have an effect on the response of acid rain, and that HS acts as a modifier on both the chemical composition and on the biological activity. The HUMEX Project is studying the impact of HS on the acidification and the effect acidification has on the biological properties of HS. This is done by artificial acidification of a whole catchment. In the fall of 1988 a dystrophic lake was divided in two halves by a plastic curtain from the middle of the natural outlet to the opposite side. During the following two years, through September 1990, the water chemistry of the two lake halves was monitored. A number of scientists from Europe and North America have been studying the organic matter and the biota in the water and in the catchment area prior to the artificial acidification, which started in October 1990. The results, after 18 months of treatment, with a combination of sulphuric acid and ammonium nitrate, show a change in the water chemistry. In the experimental lake, there is a small increase in the concentration of S and organic N and a small decrease in color and pH. A reduction of the anion deficit in the treated basin is suggested to be due to a protonisation of the HS. There are also significant biological changes in the treated lake half.																			0160-4120						1992	18	6					535	543		10.1016/0160-4120(92)90021-U	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0160-4120(92)90021-U													WOS:A1992KA01900002

A single object made of meteoritic iron has been identified, an arrowhead with a mass of 2.9 g found in the 19th Century in the late Bronze Age (900-800 BCE) lake dwelling of Mo & BULL;rigen, Switzerland. The meteoritic origin is definitely proven by combining methods extended and newly applied to an archaeological artefact. Elemental composition (7.10-8.28 wt% Ni, 0.58-0.86 wt% Co,-300 ppm Ge), primary mineralogy consisting of the associated Ni-poor and Ni-rich iron phases kamacite (6.7 wt% Ni) and taenite (33.3 wt% Ni), and the presence of cosmogenic 26Al (1.7+0.5  0.4 dpm/kg). The Ni-rich composition below the oxidized crust and the marked difference to meteorites from the nearby (4-8 km) Twannberg iron meteorite strewn field is confirmed by muon induced X-ray emission spectrometry (8.28 wt% Ni). The Ni-Ge-concentrations are consistent with IAB iron meteorites, but not with the Twannberg meteorite (4.5 wt% Ni, 49 ppm Ge). The measured activity of 26Al indicates derivation from an iron meteorite with a large (2 t minimum) pre-atmospheric mass. The flat arrowhead shows a laminated texture most likely representing a deformed Widmansta & BULL;tten pattern, grinding marks on the surface and remnants of wood-tar. Among just three large European IAB iron meteorites with fitting chemical composition, the Kaalijarv meteorite (Estonia) is the most likely source because this large crater forming fall event happened at-1500 years BC during the Bronze Age and produced many small fragments. The discovery and subsequent transport/trade of such small iron fragments appears much more likely than in case of buried large meteorite masses. Additional artefacts of the same origin may be present in archaeological collections.					; Amato, Alex/H-7674-2013; Niikura, Megumi/H-5263-2018; Garcia, Diego/Q-1359-2019; Das, Debarchan/AAI-5256-2021; Lanari, Pierre/G-8183-2011	Ritjoho, Narongrit/0000-0002-3865-3600; Amato, Alex/0000-0001-9963-7498; Vigo, Carlos/0000-0002-6389-609X; Niikura, Megumi/0000-0002-5940-2667; Das, Debarchan/0000-0001-5453-0195; Biswas, Sayani/0009-0004-4886-7532; Wiebe, Daniel/0009-0003-0981-9231; von Schoeler, Katharina/0009-0005-2671-5869; Hotz, Fabian/0000-0002-6874-0203; 													0305-4403	1095-9238				SEP	2023	157								105827	10.1016/j.jas.2023.105827	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2023.105827		JUL 2023											WOS:001050090300001

In Ohio, angler reports have been integral for monitoring long-term trends in Muskellunge Esox masquinongy fisheries. The integration of angler catch data into mark recapture methods has been increasingly advocated as a means of improving estimates of fish population metrics. A mark recapture study was conducted to evaluate population demographics of Muskellunge during 1981-2006 at Clear Fork Reservoir, Ohio. Each spring, adult Muskellunge (N = 4,134; >= 609 mm) were collected and marked using trap nets. Anglers reported catches of marked Muskellunge (i.e., resightings) between marking events. A total of 4,134 Muskellunge were marked (609-1,245 mm), 1,227 (29.7%) were recaptured in trap nets, and anglers reported catching an additional 884 marked fish (21.4%). Recaptures and angler catch reports were analyzed using a joint mark recapture, tag-resighting, and tag-recovery model (Barker model) within program MARK to estimate the probability of survival, angler catch, and emigration from the reservoir. Mean estimates of Muskellunge annual survival were 0.62 (SD = 0.22) for males and 0.71 (SD = 0.23) for females. The probability of Muskellunge being caught by anglers varied across years, and factors influencing angling vulnerability were unclear. The model tended to underestimate catch-and-release rates based on estimates derived from all angler catch reports, yet the trends toward greater release rates were generally consistent with expectations. The model suggested that emigration from the reservoir was constant over time, with any given Muskellunge having a 0.13 probability of emigrating annually. Angler catch reports provided the data necessary to make valuable inferences about the fishery that would not otherwise be available from survey netting only.					; Page, Kevin/LRB-7978-2024	Page, Kevin/0000-0001-5456-298X; 													0892-2284		978-1-934874-46-2				2017	85						75	94																WOS:000422891800006
J	Barluenga, M; Sanetra, M; Meyer, A				Barluenga, Marta; Sanetra, Matthias; Meyer, Axel			Genetic admixture of burbot (Teleostei: Lota lota) in Lake Constance from two European glacial refugia	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												The burbot, Lota lota, is the only freshwater species of the codfish family and has a Holarctic distribution. Pleistocene glaciations caused significant geographical differentiation in the past, but its life history characterized by winter spawning migrations over large distances is likely to homogenize populations by contemporary gene flow. We investigated the population genetic structure of 541 burbots from Lake Constance and adjacent Rhine and Danube tributaries in Europe using the entire mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region and 11 microsatellites. Microsatellites revealed considerable population divergence (F-ST = 0.26) and evidenced recent bottlenecks in two Central European rivers. In accordance to previous evidence two main phylogeographic lineages (Atlantic and Danubian) were found co-occurring at similar frequencies in Lake Constance, where they currently undergo random mating as indicated by microsatellites. The Danubian lineage contributed only a small proportion to the lake's mtDNA diversity, and probably expanded within the lake shortly after its formation similar to 10 000-15 000 BP. The larger Atlantic haplotype diversity suggested a population expansion older than the lake itself. Levels of admixture at microsatellite loci were less obvious due to their high variability, and coalescence methods were used to estimate past admixture proportions. Our results reinforce a model of a two-step colonization of Europe by burbot from an ancestral Danubian refuge, and confirm the persistence of a secondary Atlantic refuge, as proposed to exist for other freshwater fish. We conclude that the present-day burbot population in Lake Constance bears the genetic signature of both contemporary gene flow and historical separation events.

These blooms can sometimes be limited by iron. Due to extensive foresting around the Baltic Sea, iron is entering the Baltic Sea partly bound to dissolved organic material (DOM) via rivers. An experiment was performed in 300 1 laboratory mesocosms to test the hypothesis that riverine high-molecular weight dissolved organic matter (HMWDOM), extracted by tangential flow filtration > 1000 Da, stimulates the biomass of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, by increasing the availability of iron. The addition of iron/EDTA and of DOM resulted in 5 to 10 times higher biomass of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria. Accordingly, higher primary production and particulate nitrogen concentration at the end of the experiment were observed in those treatments compared to the control. The removal of mesozooplankton grazers did not have a significant effect on the microphytoplankton biomass and species composition. Nodularia spumigena biomass was highest in the treatments receiving DOM, but addition of iron alone had no significant effect on this. N. spumigena was less positively affected by iron addition than Anabaena cf. inaequalis, suggesting that N, spumigena is a better competitor for iron. Separate microcosms comparing additions of iron, manganese and cobalt showed that iron was limiting for cyanobacterial biomass development. The results strongly suggest that iron bound to DOM can contribute to the iron demands of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria in the Baltic Sea.

Low pH values and relatively high concentrations of heavy metals and other trace elements are often detected in the acidic rivers. In this study, water quality parameters including pH and concentrations of major cations and anions, heavy metals, and other trace elements were investigated in nine acidic river basins located in volcanic areas of Eastern Japan. The study included both untreated river basins and basins where neutralization treatment is carried out. Variations of water quality along two acidic river basins and the mechanisms controlling the variations in water quality were also discussed. Generally, the pH values ranged from 1.31 to 5.45 in the nine river basins. Positive effects from neutralization treatment were observed along the Agatsuma river basin where pH values markedly increased and the concentrations of As, Pb, F, Fe, and Al dramatically decreased. In comparison, along the untreated Nagase river basin, the pH values gradually increased and the concentrations of As, Pb, F, Fe, and Al steadily decreased, mainly due to the dilution effect caused by mixing with other rivers. In these two river basins, harmful elements such as As, Pb, and F were probably coprecipitated with Fe and Al hydroxides. The sediments deposited in the Nagase river bed and Lake Inawashiro may therefore contain much higher concentrations of harmful elements including As, Pb, and F as were previously reported on the Shinaki Dam of the Agatsuma river basin.					; Saito, Takeshi/GPW-6435-2022	Saito, Takeshi/0009-0005-8123-0637; 													2186-2982	2186-2990				JUL	2020	19	71					36	41		10.21660/2020.71.5782	http://dx.doi.org/10.21660/2020.71.5782													WOS:000521935900006
J	ALBERS, PH; CAMARDESE, MB				ALBERS, PH; CAMARDESE, MB			EFFECTS OF ACIDIFICATION ON METAL ACCUMULATION BY AQUATIC PLANTS AND INVERTEBRATES .1. CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Compared were concentrations of Al, Cd, Ca, Cu, Fe, Hg, Pb, Mg, Mn, Ni, P, and Zn in water, plants, and aquatic insects of three acidified (pH approximately 5.0) and three nonacidified (pH approximately 6.5) constructed wetlands. Concentrations of Zn in water and bur-reed (Sparganium americanum) were higher in acidified wetlands than in nonacidified wetlands. Floating nonrooted plants contained mean concentrations of Fe, Mg, and Mn that were higher than recommended maximum levels for poultry feed. The mean concentrations of all metals in insects were below recommended maximum levels for poultry feed and below levels that cause toxic effects in wild birds. Smaller than expected increases of metal concentrations in the water of acidified wetlands were probably due to limited mobilization of metals from the sediments and insignificant changes in sedimentation of aqueous metals. Calcium was lower in acidified than in nonacidified wetland water, but the Ca content of insects and bur-reed was not lower. Low concentrations of Ca in aquatic insects from both groups of wetlands indicate that calcium-rich crustaceans and mollusks are probably important to female water-fowl and their young during the spring, when invertebrates make up the majority of the diet. Although toxic effects from metal ingestion seem to be unlikely consequences of wetland acidification, the adverse effect of low pH on the occurrence of crustaceans and mollusks could threaten egg production and development of young.																			0730-7268	1552-8618				JUN	1993	12	6					959	967		10.1002/etc.5620120602	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/etc.5620120602													WOS:A1993LD03400002

Assessing climate change impacts on Pacific salmon and trout using bioenergetics and spatiotemporal explicit river temperature predictions under varying riparian conditions	PLOS ONE												Pacific salmon and trout populations are affected by timber harvest, the removal and alteration of riparian vegetation, and the resulting physical changes to water quality, temperature, and associated delivery of high-quality terrestrial prey. Juvenile salmon and trout growth, a key predictor of survival, is poorly understood in the context of current and future (climate-change mediated) conditions, with resource managers needing information on how land use will impact future river conditions for these commercially and culturally important species. We used the Heat Source water temperature modeling framework to develop a spatiotemporal model to assess how riparian canopy and vegetation preservation and addition could influence river temperatures under future climate predictions in a coastal river fed by a moraine-dammed lake: the Quinault River in Washington State. The model predicted higher water temperatures under future carbon emission projections, representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5, with varying magnitude based on different riparian vegetation scenarios. We used the daily average temperature output from these scenarios to predict potential juvenile fish growth using the Wisconsin bioenergetics model. A combination of riparian vegetation removal and continued high carbon emissions resulted in a predicted seven-day average daily maximum temperature (7DADM) increase of 1.7 degrees C in the lower river by 2080; increases in riparian shading mitigate this 7DADM increase to only 0.9 degrees C. Under the current thermal regime, bioenergetics modeling predicts juvenile fish lose weight in the lower river; this loss of potential growth worsens by an average of 20-83% in the lower river by 2080, increasing with the loss of riparian shading. This study assess the impact of riparian vegetation management on future thermal habitat for Pacific salmon and trout under warming climates and provide a useful spatially explicit modeling framework that managers can use to make decisions regarding riparian vegetation management and its mechanistic impact to water temperature and rearing juvenile fish.					; Jaeger, Kristin/AAY-3377-2020	Spanjer, Andrew/0000-0002-7288-2722; 													1932-6203					MAY 20	2022	17	5							e0266871	10.1371/journal.pone.0266871	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0266871								35594277					WOS:000944341900004

One strategy to minimize this limitation is to select a study site in an area that is marginal for agricultural activity. Here, we present a new sediment record from Lake Svityaz in northwestern Ukraine. We have reconstructed regional and local vegetation and fire dynamics since the Late Glacial using pollen, spores, macrofossils and charcoal. Boreal forest composed of Pinus sylvestris and Betula with continental Larix decidua and Pinus cembra established in the region around 13,450 cal bp, replacing an open, steppic landscape. The first temperate tree to expand was Ulmus at 11,800 cal bp, followed by Quercus, Fraxinus excelsior, Tilia and Corylus ca. 1,000 years later. Fire activity was highest during the Early Holocene, when summer solar insolation reached its maximum. Carpinus betulus and Fagus sylvatica established at ca. 6,000 cal bp, coinciding with the first indicators of agricultural activity in the region and a transient climatic shift to cooler and moister conditions. Human impact on the vegetation remained initially very low, only increasing during the Bronze Age, at ca. 3,400 cal bp. Large-scale forest openings and the establishment of the present-day cultural landscape occurred only during the past 500 years. The persistence of highly diverse mixed forest under absent or low anthropogenic disturbance until the Early Middle Ages corroborates the role of human impact in the impoverishment of temperate forests elsewhere in Central Europe. The preservation or reestablishment of such diverse forests may mitigate future climate change impacts, specifically by lowering fire risk under warmer and drier conditions.

The salinity shifts are interplays of millennial-scale sea level change, centennial-scale tectonic activity from the West Marikina Valley Fault (WMVF) and decadal-scale climatic changes. Currently only 1 m above mean sea level, the lake is connected to Manila Bay through the Pasig-Napindan River, which meanders across a densely populated "Paranaque Strip" partly occupied by metropolitan Manila. The controversial WMVF borders the lake on its western shore. Our 10.5 m sediment core from the western lobe reveal that the deposits are from a marine environment deposited 6600 cal BP to 4700 cal BP during a sea level still stand above present mean sea level (apmsl) in Southeast Asia and the Philippines. Episodic decreases in salinity with 260 y cycles were traced to the activity of the WMVF that would have accounted for at least 6 m of uplift of the Paranaque Strip. The vertical component of movement raised a sill and emergent landmass that started to isolate the Paleo-Laguna de Bay from Manila Bay. Subsequent episodic uplifts and sea level fall decreased depths to intertidal levels by 4700 cal BP, salinity to brackish but highly-influenced by marine waters by 4100 cal BP and to freshwater by 3100 cal BP. The latest salinity increase since mid-1960 is attributed to renewed saltwater incursion due to abnormally dry years, low lake levels, and Pasig River delta plain subsidence.

The construction of the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway (TTW) in the 1970s and 1980s directly linked 2 evolutionarily distinct aquatic communities, and faunal exchange across the TTW has been documented in both fishes and freshwater mussels. However, to date there have been no recognized exchanges of the turtle fauna between the Tennessee and Tombigbee river systems. Herein we document the exchange of Ouachita map turtles (Graptemys ouachitensis), a native of the Tennessee River system, and Alabama map turtles (Graptemys pulchra), a native of the Tombigbee River system, each occurring outside its native ranges in the opposite river system likely via dispersal in the TTW. For G. ouachitensis, we observed a range displacement of similar to 55 river kilometers (rkm) south from the nearest specimen records in the Tennessee River system into upper Bay Springs Lake of the Tombigbee River drainage. Graptemys pulchra had a range displacement northward of similar to 137 rkm from the nearest specimen record in the Tombigbee River system to Pickwick Lake of the Tennessee River drainage. For the latter, it seems most parsimonious that G. pulchra historically occurred farther north than the specimen record suggests. Otherwise, individuals would have had to execute movements through and/or around 4 locks and dams, which seems less probable. We recommend that additional monitoring of nonnative turtles should be conducted to document existing range and potential range expansions (inclusive of Graptemys nigrinoda, black-knobbed sawback) while studies to assess genetic introgression among these closely related species are warranted.

Warmer and drier climates that make Lake Huron into a terminal lake	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT					8th Conference on the State of Lake Huron: Ecosystem Change, Habitat and Management	2007	Honey Harbour, CANADA	Aquat Ecosyst Hlth & Management Soc, Lake Huron Binatl Partnership				Paleo-hydrologists have adjusted for glacial isostatic uplift and compared the original elevations of paleo-water level indicators and basin outlets for Lake Huron, revealing that Huron lake levels fell tens of meters below its lowest possible outlet (becoming a terminal lake) about 7,900 C-14 years BP. This corresponds to when the upper Great Lakes stopped receiving glacial melt inflow and became dependent for water supply on precipitation alone, as at present. Since these researchers accounted for differential isostatic effects, they surmised that the upper Great Lakes were impacted by severe dry climate. To understand possible climate changes that led to the closure, the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory applied their Advanced Hydrologic Prediction System to explore deviations from present climates that could force the upper Great Lakes to become terminal. GLERL modeled the steady-state water balance of the present upper Great Lakes with pre-development natural water flow conditions by employing lake outflow-depth rating curves (using estimated sill elevations) reasonable for a natural system and by using dynamic lake areas controlled by observed hypsometric relations for each lake. By using systematic shifts in precipitation and temperature relative to the present base climate, GLERL showed the temperature rises and precipitation drops required for a terminal lake; they may be less extreme if additional effects of past differences in wind speed and insolation are also considered.																			1463-4988	1539-4077					2008	11	2					153	160		10.1080/14634980802089415	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14634980802089415													WOS:000257032200005
J	Marshall, W; Laybourn-Parry, J				Marshall, W; Laybourn-Parry, J			The balance between photosynthesis and grazing in Antarctic mixotrophic cryptophytes during summer	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Grazing and photosynthetic contributions to the carbon balance of planktonic, mixotrophic cryptophytes in Lakes Fryxell and Hoare in the Taylor Valley, Antarctica were measured during November and December 2000. 2. The cryptophytes never became entirely photosynthetic, although carbon derived from grazing decreased in December. Individual grazing rates ranged between 5.28 and 10.08 bacteria cell(-1) day(-1) in Lake Fryxell and 0.36-11.76 bacteria cell(-1) day(-1) in Lake Hoare. Grazing rates varied temporally and with depth in the water column. In Lake Fryxell, which is a meromictic lake, highest grazing occurred just above the chemocline. Individual photosynthetic rates ranged from 0.23 to 1.35 pg C cell(-1) h(-1) in Lake Fryxell and 0.074 to 1.08 pg C cell(-1) h(-1) in Lake Hoare. 3. Carbon acquisition by the cryptophyte community gained through grazing ranged between 8 and 31 during November in Lake Fryxell, dropping to between 2 and 24 in December. In Lake Hoare grazing contributed 12-21% of the community carbon budget in November and 1-28% in December. Around 4 of the carbon acquired from grazing and photosynthesis was remineralised through respiration. 4. Mixotrophy is probably a major survival strategy for cryptophytes in the extreme lakes of the Dry Valleys, because perennial ice-cover severely limits light penetration to the water column, whereas these phytoflagellates are not normally mixotrophic in lower latitude lakes. The evidence suggests that mixotrophy may be a mechanism for supplementing the carbon budget, as well as a means of acquiring nutrients for growth.																			0046-5070					NOV	2002	47	11					2060	2070		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2002.00950.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2002.00950.x													WOS:000178848300003
J	Fölster, J				Fölster, J			The near-stream zone is a source of nitrogen in a Swedish forested catchment	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Most Swedish forests efficiently retain N from deposition and run-off N can be expected to originate from the near-stream zone. Nitrogen leaching from this region is low, but still may be of ecological relevance (e.g., in oligotrophic lakes). In the present study the function of the near-stream zone with respect to N chemistry in stream water of a small pristine catchment in central-south Sweden was investigated. The study included ground water, soil water, and stream water sampling. The aim was to explain the variation in N species in stream water with hydrological flow paths and the spatial and temporal variation in N in ground water and soil water. Nitrate and ammonium concentrations were negligible in ground water and soil water at most locations. When nitrate occurred, it was usually at concentrations below 100 mu g N L-1 and related to higher pH and aerobic conditions. Ammonium was detected in anaerobic locations at stable concentrations up to 200 mu g N L-1. The near-stream zone was the main source of organic N entering the stream where the median concentration was 240 mu g L-1. Nitrate occurred only occasionally in stream water at concentrations around 100 pg N L-1 and then probably originated from near-stream pre-event water. The only significant ammonium concentrations were detected during a spring flow episode and there were indications of flushing of organic matter of microbial origin. The importance of within-catchment variation for understanding leaching processes in forested catchments is discussed.

J	ROGERS, GM				ROGERS, GM			NORTH-ISLAND SERAL TUSSOCK GRASSLANDS .1. ORIGINS AND LAND-USE HISTORY	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF BOTANY												A review of the history of seral tussock grasslands in the North Island reveals no evidence for their presence below treeline in pre-human times. Tussock grasses were confined to natural non-forest sites, which, below treeline, were dominated not by tussocks, but by low trees, shrubs, and, on oligotrophic bogs, by Empodisma minus and Gleichenia dicarpa. Non-forest sites below treeline result from cold-air inversion, high water tables, and frequent geomorphic disturbance. Forest clearance by early Maori fires and subsequent recurrent burning of secondary vegetation induced 660 000 ha of seral tussock grassland in three areas of the central North Island: short tussock (Pea cita and Festuca novae-zelandiae) grasslands on the Volcanic Plateau surrounding Lake Taupo; tall tussock (Chionochloa rubra) grasslands on northern and eastern flanks of the Tongariro volcanoes; and tall tussock (Chionochloa rubra) on the moawhango plateaus. The pattern of deforestation and spread of tussock grasses in a region of law economic value to Maori is cor related with extensive undulating topography at montane-subalpine altitudes, summer-dry climates in rain-shadow areas, and free-draining volcanic ash soils. Of the 660 000 ha in grassland in c. 1840, almost half (310 000 ha) had disappeared by c. 1940, and only 10% (64 000 ha) remains today, mostly in Moawhango Ecological District. Conservation status, reserve design, and the renewable resource value of the grasslands are discussed.																			0028-825X						1994	32	3					271	286																WOS:A1994PN14000002

After a decade of pollution control efforts, it is imperative to perceive the water quality conditions and identify potential pollution factors for further maintenance. Combining the water quality identification index (WQII) and multivariate statistical techniques (MSTs), this study conducted an exploratory analysis in SNWDP-ER, based on the monitoring data in 2020-2021. The monitoring and WQII results show that the overall water quality in SNWDP-ER is satisfactory and meets the Class III requirements in China Environmental Quality Standard for Surface Water, except for total nitrogen (TN) which falls into Class V or even worse. The periodic alternations of flow direction between diversion and non-diversion periods tend to deteriorate water quality, particularly in the initial stage of alternations. Water quality appears more stable during the diversion period, and impounding lakes along the project are crucial to water environment restoration in this period. Due to the positive influence brought by the self-purification and environmental carrying in the Luoma Lake, Nansi Lake, and Dongping Lake, water quality exhibits an enhancing trend from upstream to downstream in the Lianghu and Jiaodong reaches. Besides, the monitoring stations in Shandong reach exhibit significant divisional heterogeneity under hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) with the Nansi Lake and Dongping Lake as the demarcation points, and the results of factor analysis/principal component analysis (FA/PCA) further identified the contributions of mining, shipping, and land use to each section. Based on the findings, the study recommends implementing wastewater discharge control, abandoned mines remediation, and continued water quality monitoring for further maintenance and improvement in SNWDP-ER.

J	Titolo, A				Titolo, Andrea			Use of Time-Series NDWI to Monitor Emerging Archaeological Sites: Case Studies from Iraqi Artificial Reservoirs	REMOTE SENSING												Over the last 50 years, countries across North Africa and the Middle East have seen a significant increase in dam construction which, notwithstanding their benefits, have endangered archaeological heritage. Archaeological surveys and salvage excavations have been carried out in threatened areas in the past, but the formation of reservoirs often resulted in the permanent loss of archaeological data. However, in 2018, a sharp fall in the water level of the Mosul Dam reservoir led to the emersion of the archaeological site of Kemune and allowed for its brief and targeted investigation. Reservoir water level change is not unique to the Mosul Dam, but it is a phenomenon affecting most of the artificial lakes of present-day Iraq. However, to know in advance which sites will be exposed due to a decrease in water level can be a challenging task, especially without any previous knowledge, field investigation, or high-resolution satellite image. Nonetheless, by using time-series medium-resolution satellite images, combined to obtain spectral indexes for different years, it is possible to monitor "patterns" of emerging archaeological sites from three major Iraqi reservoirs: Mosul, Haditha and Hamrin lake. The Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI), generated from annual composites of Landsat and Sentinel-2 images, allow us to distinguish between water bodies and other land surfaces. When coupled with a pixel analysis of each image, the index can provide a mean for highlighting whether an archaeological site is submerged or not. Moreover, using a zonal histogram algorithm in QGIS over polygon shapefiles that represent a site surface, it is possible to assess the area of a site that has been exposed over time. The same analyses were carried out on monthly composites for the year 2018, to assess the impact of monthly variation of the water level on the archaeological sites. The results from both analyses have been visually evaluated using medium-resolution true colour images for specific years and locations and with 3 m resolution Planetscope images for 2018. Understanding emersion "patterns" of known archaeological sites provides a useful tool for targeted rescue excavation, while also expanding the knowledge of the post-flooding impact on cultural heritage in the regions under study.

Geostatistical exploration of spatial variation of summertime temperatures in the Detroit metropolitan region	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Background: Because of the warming climate urban temperature patterns have been receiving increased attention. Temperature within urban areas can vary depending on land cover, meteorological and other factors. High resolution satellite data can be used to understand this intra-urban variability, although they have been primarily studied to characterize urban heat islands at a larger spatial scale. Objective: This study examined whether satellite-derived impervious surface and meteorological conditions from multiple sites can improve characterization of spatial variability of temperature within an urban area. Methods: Temperature was measured at 17 outdoor sites throughout the Detroit metropolitan area during the summer of 2008. Kriging and linear regression were applied to daily temperatures and secondary information, including impervious surface and distance-to-water. Performance of models in predicting measured temperatures was evaluated by cross-validation. Variograms derived from several scenarios were compared to determine whether high-resolution impervious surface information could capture fine-scale spatial structure of temperature in the study area. Results: Temperatures measured at the sites were significantly different from each other, and all kriging techniques generally performed better than the two linear regression models. Impervious surface values and distance-to-water generally improved predictions slightly. Restricting models to days with lake breezes and with less cloud cover also somewhat improved the predictions. In addition, incorporating high-resolution impervious surface information into cokriging or universal kriging enhanced the ability to characterize fine-scale spatial structure of temperature. Conclusions: Meteorological and satellite-derived data can better characterize spatial variability in temperature across a metropolitan region. The data sources and methods we used can be applied in epidemiological studies and public health interventions to protect vulnerable populations from extreme heat events. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

J	Gasparon, M; Matschullat, J				Gasparon, M; Matschullat, J			Geogenic sources and sinks of trace metals in the Larsemann Hills, East Antarctica: Natural processes and human impact	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												To evaluate the extent of human impact on a pristine Antarctic environment, natural baseline levels of trace metals have been established in the basement rocks of the Larsemann Hills, East Antarctica. From a mineralogical and geochemical point of view the Larsemann Hills basement is relatively homogeneous, and contains high levels of Pb, Th and U. These may become soluble during the relatively mild Antarctic summer and be transported to lake waters by surface and subsurface melt water. Melt waters may also be locally enriched in V, Cr, Co, Ni, Zn and Sri derived from weathering of metabasite pods. With a few notable exceptions, the trace metal concentrations measured in the Larsemann Hills lake waters can be entirely accounted for by natural processes such as sea spray and surface melt water input. Thus, the amount of trace metals released by weathering of basement lithologies and dispersed into the Larsemann Hills environment, and presumably in similar Antarctic environments, is, in general, not negligible, and may locally be substantial. The Larsemann Hills sediments are coarse-grained and contain minute amounts of clay-size particles, although human activities have contributed to the generation of fine-grained material at the most impacted sites. Irrespective of their origin, these small amounts of fine-grained clastic sediments have a relatively small surface area and charge, and are not as effective metal sinks as the abundant, thick cyanobacterial algal mats that cover the lake floors. Thus, the concentration of trace metals in the Larsemann Hills lake waters is regulated by biological activity and thawing-freezing cycles, rather than by the type and amount of clastic sediment supply.

On the basis of the retention curves of the two lakes that formed in the northwestern and southwestern sectors, we calculated the total infiltration capacity of the polje to have a maximum value of 3 - 3.5 m(3)/s and so we infer that when the flow of the Arroyo de la Madre exceeds this figure, there will be a risk of flooding in the polje. We also propose a model for the 1996 flood that can be extended to other similar occurrences in this and other poljes where we can establish the role played by groundwater and surface water during this flood. In response to the heavy precipitation, the flow of the Arroyo de la Madre rose abruptly, exceeding the infiltration capacity of the main swallow holes on the polje, causing first the northern lake and then the southern lake to form with only surface water supply. The water table of the karst aquifer rose sharply, reaching a situation of equilibrium between the level in the lakes and the water table in this sector of the karst aquifer that prevented infiltration through the swallow holes. In the case of the southern lake, there were even cases of swallow holes that began to operate as estavelles. During this phase of maximum flooding, one single lake was present, which was divided into two once more when the water table of the karst aquifer in the polje sector began to fall and surface supply also began to decrease.

(1999) to derive quantitative chironomid-temperature transfer functions. We use new data for water temperatures based on two-hourly recordings from thermistors installed in 32 lakes and air-temperature data from an automatic weather station at one lake to refute Seppalas accusations that our field data are unsatisfactory. We also respond to Seppala's suggestions about factors influencing chironomid distribution and abundance and suggest that there is a serious confusion of temporal and spatial scales between Seppala's ideas and the Olander et al. study. We attempt to explain the underlying logic behind empirical transfer functions that form a major part of Holocene quantitative environmental reconstructions and the major assumptions behind such transfer functions as Seppala appears not to understand the basis or the assumptions of such widely used numerical models in palaeolimnology. We respond to Seppala's comments that lakewater pH and distance beyond tree-line have been inadequately measured and answer his erroneous understanding that a helicopter was used to facilitate lake sampling. We briefly consider Seppala's suggestion that a helicopter can totally mix the surface water of a lake for many hours.					Birks, H. John B./C-3103-2008; Birks, John/C-3103-2008	Birks, H.

Despite evidence confirming active refreezing processes above the equilibrium line, their impact on runoff and proglacial discharge has yet to be assessed. Here, we compare meteorological, melt, firn stratigraphy and discharge data from the extreme 2010 and 2012 summers to determine the relationship between atmospheric forcing and melt runoff at the land-terminating Kangerlussuaq sector of the Greenland ice sheet, which drains into the Watson River. The 6.8aEuro-km(3) bulk discharge in 2012 exceeded that in 2010 by 28aEuro-%, despite only a 3aEuro-% difference in net incoming melt energy between the two years. This large disparity can be explained by a 10aEuro-% contribution of runoff originating from above the long-term equilibrium line in 2012 caused by diminished firn retention. The amplified 2012 response was compounded by catchment hypsometry; the disproportionate increase in area contributing to runoff as the melt-level rose high into the accumulation area. Satellite imagery and aerial photographs reveal an extensive supraglacial network extending 140aEuro-km from the ice margin that confirms active meltwater runoff originating well above the equilibrium line. This runoff culminated in three days with record discharge of 3100aEuro-m(3)aEuro-s(-1) (0.27aEuro-GtaEuro-d(-1)) that peaked on 11 July and washed out the Watson River Bridge. Our findings corroborate melt infiltration processes in the percolation zone, though the resulting patterns of refreezing are complex and can lead to spatially extensive, perched superimposed ice layers within the firn. In 2012, such layers extended to an elevation of at least 1840aEuro-m and provided a semi-impermeable barrier to further meltwater storage, thereby promoting widespread runoff from the accumulation area of the Greenland ice sheet that contributed directly to proglacial discharge and global sea-level rise.					; Hubbard, Alun/R-5085-2017; Bailey, Hannah/AAN-9643-2021; MacFerrin, Michael/A-5794-2018; Box, Jason/AAE-1654-2019	Pettersson, Rickard/0000-0002-6961-0128; Bailey, Hannah/0000-0002-8913-8473; Bailey, Hannah/0000-0003-4085-3721; Doyle, Samuel/0000-0002-0853-431X; Hubbard, Alun/0000-0002-0503-3915; Lindback, Katrin/0000-0002-5941-6743; Box, Jason/0000-0003-0052-8705; MacFerrin, Michael/0000-0001-8157-7159; 													1994-0416	1994-0424					2016	10	3					1147	1159		10.5194/tc-10-1147-2016	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/tc-10-1147-2016													WOS:000379415500013
J	Reddy, YR				Reddy, Yenumula Ranga			NEODIAPTOMUS PRATEEK N. SP., A NEW FRESHWATER COPEPOD FROM ASSAM, INDIA, WITH CRITICAL REVIEW OF GENERIC ASSIGNMENT OF NEODIAPTOMUS SPP. AND A NOTE ON DIAPTOMID SPECIES RICHNESS (CALANOIDA: DIAPTOMIDAE)	JOURNAL OF CRUSTACEAN BIOLOGY												Neodiaptomus prateek n. sp. is described based on a plankton sample collected from Deepor Beel, a floodplain lake in the north-eastern, Indian state of Assam, which falls within the key biodiversity area of the Indo-Burma Hotspot. The new species fulfils all the principal criteria of the genus Neodiaptomus Kiefer, 1932, as revised by Kiefer (1939). It has, however, a spectacular autapomorphic feature, which is perhaps unparalleled in Diaptomidae as - a whole a massive coxal plate ending in a thumb-like spinulose structure on the caudal surface of the male left P5. The new taxon also has two homoplastic characters that are hitherto unknown within the genus: the female fourth pediger has a prominent mid-dorsal process, and the third endopodal segment of P2-P4 has six instead of seven setae, the proximal outer seta being absent. The affinities of the new species with its congeners are discussed. Furthermore, the generic assignment of all the 13 species of Neodiaptomus listed in the latest World Copepoda database (Walter, 2012) is critically reviewed. Of these, five species are recognised as valid, six are relegated to species inquirendae, and one each is a nomen dubium and a synonym. Two lineage groups are recognised within the genus, one belonging to Southeast Asia and the other mostly confined to India. Surprisingly, the new species was accompanied by a record number of seven other diaptomid species in the same sample; the probable biogeographic and ecological implications of this high species richness are briefly discussed.																			0278-0372	1937-240X				NOV	2013	33	6					849	865		10.1163/1937240X-00002195	http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1937240X-00002195													WOS:000327166600010

Generalist fish species are recognised as important couplers of benthic and pelagic food-web compartments in lakes. However, interspecific niche segregation and individual specialisation may limit the potential for generalistic feeding behaviour. 2. We studied summer habitat use, stomach contents and stable isotopic compositions of the generalist feeder Arctic charr coexisting with its common resource competitor brown trout in five subarctic lakes in northern Norway to reveal population-level and individual-level niche plasticity. 3. Charr and trout showed partial niche segregation in all five lakes. Charr used all habitat types and a wide variety of invertebrate prey including zooplankton, whereas trout fed mainly on insects in the littoral zone. Hence, charr showed a higher potential to promote habitat and food-web coupling compared to littoral-dwelling trout. 4. The level of niche segregation between charr and trout and between pelagic-caught and littoral-caught charr depended on the prevailing patterns of interspecific and intraspecific resource competition. The two fish species had partially overlapping trophic niches in one lake where charr numerically dominated the fish community, whereas the most segregated niches occurred in lakes where trout were more abundant. 5. In general, pelagic-caught charr had substantially narrower dietary and isotopic niches and relied less on littoral carbon sources compared to littoral-caught conspecifics that included generalist as well as specialised benthivorous and planktivorous individuals. Despite the partially specialised planktivorous niche and thus reduced potential of pelagic-dwelling charr to promote benthicpelagic coupling, the isotopic compositions of both charr subpopulations suggested a significant reliance on both littoral and pelagic carbon sources in all five study lakes. 6. Our study demonstrates that both interspecific niche segregation between and individual trophic specialisation within generalist fish species can constrain food-web coupling and alter energy mobilisation to top consumers in subarctic lakes. Nevertheless, pelagic and littoral habitats and food-web compartments may still be highly integrated due to the potentially plastic foraging behaviour of top consumers.					; Eloranta, Antti/IUM-9302-2023	Eloranta, Antti/0000-0002-8893-0135; Amundsen, Per-Arne/0000-0002-2203-8216; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				JAN	2013	58	1					207	221		10.1111/fwb.12052	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12052													WOS:000312538400016

A comparison of survival and behavior of lake whitefish following transmitter implantation using electro- or chemical immobilization	ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY												BackgroundThe number of telemetry studies focused on lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) in the Laurentian Great Lakes has steadily increased over the last decade, but field tests of immobilization methods used for tag implantation, which have the potential to affect survival and behavior of fish after release, are lacking. We compared post-tagging survival and behavior of lake whitefish that were immobilized for tag implantation using electroimmobilization via a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) unit or by chemical immobilization via exposure to 10% eugenol.ResultsAcoustic tags were implanted into 126 adult lake whitefish (N = 126; N = 67 TENS treatment group, N = 59 eugenol treatment group) collected from the Fox River, Wisconsin, during the spawning period in November 2021. We found no significant differences between treatments in the number of days that lake whitefish spent in the Fox River following tagging (TENS mean = 13.4 days, eugenol mean = 14.7), and also found that the proportions of fish within each treatment group that returned to the Fox River during fall 2022 (51% from TENS treatment group, 49% from eugenol treatment group) did not differ from the proportions for all fish that were confirmed to be alive at that time. The best Cormack-Jolly-Seber model indicated no differences in survival between the two treatment groups (monthly survival = 0.980, 95% CI 0.970-0.987). Fish immobilized using TENS underwent almost immediate induction and recovery from surgeries, while fish immobilized using eugenol had induction times that ranged 167-487 s (mean = 347 s) and recovery times that ranged 51-2358 s (mean = 1242 s).ConclusionsShort- and long-term behavior (time to exit of Fox River, return to Fox River in the next spawning season) and monthly survival estimates of lake whitefish did not differ between the immobilization treatments. Either method may be suitable for immobilization during tag implantation, but the additional time needed for induction and recovery of fish when using eugenol may be a limiting factor in some field-based tagging situations.

Here, we built a database using archives of temperature, water chemistry and zooplankton data from 60 Scandinavian lakes that represent broad spatial and temporal gradients in key parameters: temperature, calcium (Ca), total phosphorus (TP), total organic carbon (TOC), and pH. Using machine learning techniques, we found that Ca was the most important determinant of the relative abundance of all zooplankton groups studied, while pH was second, and TOC third in importance. Further, we found that Ca is declining in almost all lakes, and we detected a critical Ca threshold in lake water of 1.3 mg L-1, below which the relative abundance of zooplankton shifts toward dominance of Holopedium gibberum and small cladocerans at the expense of Daphnia and copepods. Our findings suggest that low Ca concentrations may shape zooplankton communities, and that current trajectories of Ca decline could promote widespread changes in pelagic food webs as zooplankton are important trophic links from phytoplankton to fish and different zooplankton species play different roles in this context. Among five environmental variables tested, we found that low lake calcium (Ca) concentrations shape most zooplankton communities in northern lakes. When lake water Ca falls below a threshold of 1.3 mg L-1, the relative abundance of zooplankton shifts toward dominance of Holopedium and small cladocerans at the expense of Daphnia and cyclopoid and calanoid copepods. The current trajectory of Ca declines found in northern lakes implies community shifts toward dominance of smaller and less nutritious zooplankton. Ca declines potentially have strong repercussions for lake food webs and productivity as zooplankton are important trophic links from phytoplankton to fish.image					Hessen, Dag/AFI-5448-2022; Paltsev, Aleksey/MEO-7358-2025; Drakare, Stina/D-4532-2016; de Wit, Heleen/ABO-9056-2022; Vrede, Tobias/C-1956-2015; Lau, Danny Chun Pong/D-4457-2013; Kortelainen, Pirkko/AAN-7045-2020; Creed, Irena/L-8810-2013; Drakare, Stina/ABF-1259-2020; Lau, Danny/D-4457-2013	Drakare, Stina/0000-0002-7389-2105; Bergstrom, Ann-Kristin/0000-0001-5102-4289; Vrede, Tobias/0000-0001-8235-9890; Lau, Danny Chun Pong/0000-0002-3246-7508; Kahilainen, Kimmo/0000-0002-1539-014X; Creed, Irena/0000-0001-8199-1472; 													1354-1013	1365-2486				MAR	2024	30	3							e17220	10.1111/gcb.17220	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.17220								38433333					WOS:001177052900001

Tyler			First appearance of Grevy's zebra (Equus grevyi), from the Middle Pleistocene Kapthurin Formation, Kenya, sheds light on the evolution and paleoecology of large zebras	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Grevy's zebra (Equus grevyi) has been reported from fossil sites spanning the past 2.3 Myr and covering a wide geographic range. However, no currently published reports dating to >200 ka can be confidently attributed to E. grevyi, with most specimens better allocated to another taxon or lacking diagnostic characteristics aligning them with E. grevyi to the exclusion of other large Equus species such as E. oldowayensis. This leaves the origin of Grevy's zebra unresolved. Here, we describe a largely complete cranium of a large mare from the Kapthurin Formation in Kenya's Baringo Basin that represents the first definitive appearance of E. grevyi at 547.0-392.6 ka. This cranium falls within the range of variation for recent E. grevyi and is morphologically distinct from all other fossil and extant zebras. The new Kapthurin specimen has implications for the complex evolutionary history of large zebras. Furthermore, it provides insights into the mechanisms underpinning the expanded range of Grevy's zebra during the Pleistocene. Based on species distribution modeling and a multivariate analysis of its climate niche, we argue that the wide fossil distribution of E. grevyi may have had little to do with Pleistocene aridity as previously argued. Instead, the range contraction of Grevy's zebra may have been driven by competition with plains zebra (E. quagga) after the northward expansion of the latter species. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Atmospheric input of POPs into Lake Maggiore (Northern Italy):: PBDE concentrations and profile in air, precipitation, settling material and sediments	CHEMOSPHERE												Large lakes are sinks for many chemical pollutants but the role of the atmosphere in delivering PBDEs (polybrominated diphenyl ethers) is not well known. In this study we estimated inputs of PBDEs from the atmosphere to Lake Maggiore and the delivery via settling material to accumulated bottom sediments. Sampling consisted of one simultaneous week of air and bulk deposition during Spring 2005, an integrated 4-month period of collected settling material (via sediment trap), and superficial bottom sediments near the sediment trap deployment and tributary mouths of the lake. Concentration of total PBDEs (Sigma 8) in the sediments ranged between 0.06 and 27 ng g(-1), and two different patterns were observed. One pattern was dominated by BDE-47 and BDE-99 and a second by BDE-209. The latter pattern suggested input from local source(s). Total PBDEs in air were 107 pg m(-3) with a pattern dominated by BDE-47. The bulk deposition rate of total PBDEs for precipitation was measurated to be 17.6 ng m(-2) day(-1) where BDE-209 exhibited the highest concentration. For aquatic settling material the flux was 3.57 ng m(-2) day(-1) and was dominated by congeners BDE-47 and BDE-99. The bulk deposition and settling material fluxes were in the same range for the less brominated congeners, while for the hepta- and deca-brominated PBDEs the fluxes in the settling material were one order of magnitude lower. This suggests different sedimentation processes among congeners and/or the presence of local sources that influence the relative distribution in water column. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Detour Lake Mine is an underground narrow vein gold mine operating at 3750 tons per day. The ore body extends from surface down to the 745 metre level striking east-west and dipping about 70 degrees to 80 degrees to the north. The SLR stope block extends from 560 to 660 m level and varies in width from 5 to 10 m and is approximately 300 m along strike. The hangingwall movements were measured using extensometers at various sections. Numerical modelling studies were carried out to back analyze two opened areas and to predict the stability of an area to be mined. A Block-Spring Model (BSM) was used in this study to simulate the jointed rocks. The back analyses of two mined sections agreed well with the monitoring data that allowed the prediction of the new stope to be made with confidence. The measurements of the hangingwall displacements at the analyzed cross-sections are presented. A comparison indicated that the displacements of the hangingwall reached the magnitude predicted when the stope was mined. This study indicated that the back analysis of an open mine stope and numerical model calibration can be very useful for prediction of stope behaviour.																					90-5410-906-8				1997							1571	1575																WOS:000073164600138

Phototrophic community included prokaryotic cells, such as oxy-photobacteria (cyanobacteria), anoxyphotobacteria, eukaryotic cells representing cryptophytes, dinophytes, diatoms, chrysophytes, xanthophytes, haptophytes, and green algae. 112 taxa of the phototrophs were recorded. Most of them were eukaryotic cells (83 species), including chlorophytes (48) and diatoms (15). The range of the photortophs biomass was between 0.1 and about 3 mg l(-1), and its maximum was at 8 m depth, mostly due to eukaryotic cells. In the shallower waters layers the contributions of the cyanobacteria and the eukaryotes to the total biomass were very similar. Starting from 10 m anoxyphotobacteria increased in importance and near the bottom their contribution to phototrophic biomass exceed 50%. The smallest phototrophs were dominated by the picocyanobacteria. The joint contribution of pico- and nanoplankton in the water column ranged significantly. In the epilimnion it was about 30%, in the upper part of metalimnion it reached 50%, and in the lower part of hypolimnion they accounted for 70% of total phototrophic biomass. In the microplankton, the highest biomass was produced by the filamentous cyanobacteria and phytoflagellates. These examinations are pointing out to the need for a holistic approach to the photosynthetic organisms and show that at increasing depths different groups of phototrophs play the role as major producers.

For this purpose, an X-ray powder diffraction scanner (MA-XRPD) capable of visualising crystalline compounds in a highly specific manner was recently developed. Many inorganic pigments present in paintings fall into this category of materials. In this study, the 17th century oil painting Girl with a Pearl Earring (c. 1665) by Johannes Vermeer was analysed with a combination of transmission and reflection mode MA-XRPD. By employing this scanner in reflection mode, the relative sensitivity for compounds that are present at the paint surface could be increased, establishing it as a highly relevant technique for investigating the degradation processes that are ongoing at paint surfaces. Many of the original pigments employed by Vermeer could be identified, along with four secondary alteration products: gypsum (CaSO4 center dot 2H(2)O), anglesite (PbSO4), palmierite (K2Pb(SO4)(2)) and weddellite (CaC2O4 center dot 2H(2)O). The formation of gypsum was linked to the presence of chalk in the upper glaze layer while the formation of palmierite and weddellite is driven by the presence of lake pigments (and their substrates). In this manner, MA-XRPD can also be used to pinpoint locations relevant for sampling and synchrotron mu-XRPD analysis, which provides information on the microscopic make-up of the paint. A paint cross-section taken from an area rich in palmierite was analysed with synchrotron mu-XRPD, which confirmed the presence of this secondary compound at the interface of the upper paint layer with the ground layer as well as the presence of anglesite in the ground layer. The capacity of MA-XRPD to identify and chart secondary alteration products in a non-invasive manner has only very recently been demonstrated and makes it a highly relevant technique for the assessment of the chemical condition of works of art.

We analyzed the annual rings of trees with two main purposes: (1) to track changes in the magnitude of magmatic CO2 emission over time. and (2) to determine the onset of magmatic CO2 emission at numerous sites on Mammoth Mountain. The onset of CO2 emission at different areas of tree kill was determined to be in 1990, closely following the seismic events of 1989. At Horseshoe Lake (HSL), CO2 emission was found to have peaked in 1991 and to have subsequently declined by a factor of two through 1998. The tree-ring data also show that emissions of magmatic carbon from cold springs below the tree-kill areas occurred well before 1989. Trees located on the margins of the kill areas or otherwise away from zones of maximum gas discharge were found to be better integrators of magmatic CO2 emission than those located in the center of tree kills. Although quantitative extrapolations from our data to a flux history will require that a relationship be: established between C-14 depletion in tree rings and average annual magmatic CO2 flux, the pattern of C-14 depletion in tree rings is likely to be the most reliable indicator of the long-term changes in the magnitude of CO2 release from Mammoth Mountain.

This hypothesis had been corroborated by the post-Hypsithermal retreat of the marine range of C, gunteri from the Maritimes of Atlantic Canada to the south of Cape God, MA, Although recent colonization of the lake cannot be precluded, marine source populations of C, gunteri are now quite distant, making the only viable colonization mode, avian transport, very difficult, The adaptation of the mid-Holocene populations of this species to the progressively colder post Hypsithermal climate and often to extremely low salinity values in Lake Winnipegosis is remarkable. The great abundance of C, gunteri in sediments of Lake Winnipegosis, in some areas making up most of the sediment, also raises potential concerns about the interpretation of supposed marine sections based exclusively on the presence of foraminifera.																			0096-1191					APR	2001	31	2					108	119		10.2113/0310108	http://dx.doi.org/10.2113/0310108													WOS:000168841000004

Short-Term Dynamics of Bdellovibrio and Like Organisms in Lake Geneva in Response to a Simulated Climatic Extreme Event	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												The short time-scale dynamics of three families of Bdellovibrio and like organisms (i.e. Bdellovibrionaceae, Peredibacteraceae, and Bacteriovoracaceae) were studied on the surface waters of Lake Geneva in summer. Using mesocosms deployed nearshore in July 2019, we simulated an extreme climatic event (an input of carbon from the watershed in response to runoff from the catchment, light reduction, and mixing in response to stormy conditions) and aimed to study the impact of both abiotic and biotic factors on their dynamics. The three families of Bdellovibrio and like organisms (BALOs) showed different dynamics during the experiment. Peredibacteraceae was the most abundant group, whereas Bacteriovoracaceae was the least abundant. Compared with the other two families, the abundance of Bdellovibrionaceae did not fluctuate, remaining relatively stable over time. Environmental variables only partially explained the dynamics of these families; in particular, temperature, pH, and chloride concentrations were positively correlated with Bacteriovoracaceae, Bdellovibrionaceae, and Peredibacteraceae abundance, respectively. Prokaryote-like particles (PLPs), such as those with high DNA content (HDNA), were strongly and positively correlated with Peredibacteraceae and Bacteriovoracaceae. In contrast, no relationships were found between Bdellovibrionaceae and PLP abundance, nor between the virus-like particles (VLPs) and the different BALOs. Overall, the experiment revealed that predation was stable in the face of the simulated climatic events. In addition, we observed that Peredibacteraceae and Bacteriovoracaceae share common traits, while Bdellovibrionaceae seems to constitute a distinct category.

J	Russell, IA				Russell, Ian A.			Waterbird community changes in the Wilderness Lakes, South Africa (Part 3 of 3): Diving piscivores and scavengers	KOEDOE												Estuarine waterbodies typically support diverse and abundant waterbird communities. However, global environmental degradation as a result of anthropogenic activities is leading to species level changes in biodiversity, with top predators such as piscivorous waterbirds being particularly vulnerable to ecosystem changes. The study aimed to document long-term spatial and temporal patterns of abundance of piscivorous and scavenging waterbirds in the Wilderness Lakes Complex (WLC) in the Garden Route National Park, South Africa, and where possible identify potential causes for observed trends. The abundance of waterbirds on these wetlands was determined biannually from 1992 to 2019, with counts conducted from a boat following a standardised route. Historical waterbird abundance data from the 1980s were also used to describe long-term abundance changes. Eight of the species exhibited seasonal variability in abundance with most, excluding Common Tern Sterna hirundo, being more abundant in winter. Substantial changes occurred in the abundance of several species over the four-decade study period, notably increases in Cape Cormorant Phalacrocorax capensis and Great Crested Grebe Podiceps cristatus, and decreases in Common Tern and Black-necked Grebe Podiceps nigricollis. Long-term abundance trends indicate a combination of declining, increasing, and stable populations. Although some species have undergone contrasting abundance changes on different waterbodies in the WLC the dominant pattern was a similar direction of change on most or all waterbodies and in different seasons. Local reasons for changes probably include loss of sandbanks, changing prey availability, and the absence of recreational disturbance on some waterbodies.Conservation implications: Drivers of changes in the abundances of piscivores are likely to be multifaceted, functioning on multiple spatial and temporal scales, and affecting different species in different ways. Recommended local corrective actions include managing emergent macrophyte encroachment on sandbanks, reducing recreational disturbance, managing processes affecting indigenous fish stocks, and protecting nesting sites.																			0075-6458	2071-0771				DEC 6	2023	65	1							a1772	10.4102/koedoe.v65i1.1772	http://dx.doi.org/10.4102/koedoe.v65i1.1772													WOS:001129806000001

Every restoration measure, however, is itself a disturbance to the ecosystem. Methods Here, we examine an ecosystem shift in a coastal fen at the southern Baltic Sea which was rewetted by flooding. The analyses are based on one year of bi-weekly closed chamber measurements of methane fluxes gathered at spots located in different vegetation stands. During measurement campaigns, we recorded data on water levels, peat temperatures, and chemical properties of peat water. In addition we analyzed the first 20 cm of peat before and after flooding for dry bulk density (DBD), content of organic matter and total amounts of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), and other nutrients. Results Rewetting turned the site from a summer dry fen into a shallow lake with water levels up to 0.60 m. We observed a substantial die-back of vegetation, especially in stands of sedges (Carex acutiformis Ehrh). Concentrations of total organic carbon and nitrogen in the peat water, as well as dry bulk density and concentrations of C, N and S in the peat increased. In the first year after rewetting, the average annual exchange of methane amounted to 0.26 +/- 0.06 kg m(-2). This is equivalent to a 190-times increase in methane compared to pre-flooding conditions. Highest methane fluxes occurred in sedge stands which suffered from the heaviest die-back. None of the recorded environmental variables showed consistent relationships with the amounts of methane exchanged. Conclusions Our results suggest that rewetting projects should be monitored not only with regard to vegetation development but also with respect to biogeochemical conditions. Further, high methane emissions that likely occur directly after rewetting by flooding should be considered when forecasting the overall effect of rewetting on GHG exchange.					; Glatzel, Stephan/AAE-8189-2019; Hahn, Juliane/LLM-9787-2024; Jurasinski, Gerald/AAH-6376-2021	Jurasinski, Gerald/0000-0002-6248-9388; Glatzel, Stephan/0000-0002-2572-5484													1932-6203					OCT 13	2015	10	10							e0140657	10.1371/journal.pone.0140657	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0140657								26461916					WOS:000362962300112

The date on which adults first entered the inlet each spring corresponded to the first rise of daily maximum stream temperature above 10[degree]C. Days on which increased numbers of shiners ascended the inlet were positively associated with days of rising daily maximum water temperature, and were not associated with water levels. Egg deposition occurred both in daylight and darkness. Downstream movement of shiner fry was greatest during periods of turbidity, and occurred largely during darkness. Shiners first spawned at age III or older; some lived to age V or VL Number of adult shiners over 79 mm fork length was estimated by Petersen marking experiments to be about 13,000 in the 42-acre lake. A large interchange of adults took place in some years between the lake and parts of the watershed upstream; a small interchange occurred downstream. Many shiners entered a stream more than once each year. Many survived to spawn in two or more successive years. Movement into the streams varied markedly in different years and was small compared with the number of adults in the lake. Homing is suggested as a mechanism which determines the proportion of inlet-, outlet-, and lake-spawning in this species.																									1963	20	4					1001	1030		10.1139/f63-069	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f63-069													WOS:A1963WV54400009

Aerobic release and biodegradation of dissolved organic matter from frozen peat: Effects of temperature and heterotrophic bacteria	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Understanding the conditions of dissolved organic matter (DOM) release from thawing peat in the Arctic regions and identifying the pathways of processing DOM by soil and aquatic heterotrophic bacteria are critical in the context of rapid climate change. Until now, experimental approaches did not allow quantitative predictions of temperature and biota effects on carbon release from peat in permafrost-affected aquatic environments. In this study, we incubated frozen peat and its aqueous leachate at various temperatures (4, 25 or 45 degrees C), with and without culturable heterotrophic bacteria Iodobacter sp., extracted from thermokarst lakes, to quantify the release and the removal rate of organic carbon (OC) with time. The metabolic diversity of the native microbial community associated with the substrates involved in OC processing was also characterized. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that, after degradation, the associated bacteria are mostly located in the inner parts of plant cells, and that the degradation of organic matter around bacteria is more pronounced at 4 and 25 degrees C compared to 45 degrees C. The metabolic diversity of heterotrophic bacteria was equally high at 4 and 25 degrees C, but lower at 45 degrees C. Regardless of the microbial consortium (native community alone or with added culturable heterotrophs), both the OC release from peat and the OC removal from peat leachate by bacteria were similar at 4 and 25 degrees C. Very low apparent activation energies of DOM biodegradation between 4 and 25 degrees C (- 4.23 +/- 12.3 kJ mol(-1)) suggest that the short-period of surface water warming in summer would have an insignificant effect on DOM microbial processing. Such duration (1-3 weeks) is comparable with the water residence time in peat depressions and permafrost subsidences, where peat degradation and DOM microbial processing occur. This questions the current paradigm of a drastic effect of temperature rise on organic carbon release from frozen peatlands, and should be considered for modelling short-term climate impacts in these regions.

Modeling probability of waterfowl encounters from satellite imagery of habitat in the central Canadian arctic	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												We used aerial survey and corresponding digital land cover data to develop species-habitat models to describe breeding-ground distributions and landscape-level habitat associations of greater white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons), Canada (Branta canadensis) and cackling geese (B. hutchinsii), tundra swans (Cygnus columbianus), king eiders (Somateria spectabilis), and long-tailed ducks (Clangula hyemalis). We then used habitat associations in the Queen Maud Gulf Migratory Bird Sanctuary and the Rasmussen Lowlands, Nunavut, Canada, in models to predict distributions of focal species in each study area. We used the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) method and the area-under-the-curve (AUC) metric to evaluate predictive accuracy (hereafter, quality) of models. In the Queen Maud Gulf, AUC values suggested reasonable model discrimination for white-fronted geese, Canada geese, and tundra swans (i.e., AUC>0.7). Quality of species-habitat models for king eiders and long-tailed ducks was less than other species considered, but these models still predicted encounters and non-encounters significantly better than the null model. For all species, quality of species-habitat models was lesser for the Rasmussen Lowlands than for the Queen Maud Gulf, although discrimination ability for Rasmussen Lowland distributions remained significantly better than corresponding null models for geese and swans, but not for seaducks. Our research suggested that species' distributions modeled with landscape-level habitat data is a tractable method to 1) identify habitat associations, 2) determine key habitats and regions, and 3) predict probable summer distributions of some waterfowl species over relatively large areas of the arctic from satellite imagery.

Tropical soil profiles reveal the fate of plant wax biomarkers during soil storage	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												The waxy coating that protects the leaves and other soft tissues of plants includes n-alkane and n-alkanoic acid compounds that are commonly used as biomarkers to reconstruct past environment. Plant waxes have geological relevance given their persistence in soils and paleosols, as well as in lake and marine sediments, yet diagenesis may alter their molecular and isotopic signatures from synthesis to deposition. This study seeks to understand the fate of plant wax biomarkers in soils after leaf-fall as characterized by a series of tropical soil profiles. We investigate the changes in abundance, molecular distributions, and hydrogen (delta D) and carbon isotopic compositions (delta C-13) of plant waxes (n-alkanes and n-alkanoic acids) in six litter-to-soil profiles along a 2740 m elevation transect from the eastern flank of the Andes mountains down to the lowland Amazon floodplain in Peru. From litter to soil, we find acid/alkane ratios increase while absolute abundances decrease. In contrast, within each soil, acid/alkane ratios are roughly constant, and we find an equivalent exponential decline in concentration in both compound classes with depth, with molecular distributions indicating some new production. We observe a 4-6 parts per thousand C-13-enrichment from litter to deeper soils for both C-29 n-alkanes and C-30 n-alkanoic acids, of which the Suess effect accounts for <= 2 parts per thousand. We infer that microbial degradation and production (or 'turnover') processes influence the (delta C-13 of plant waxes that survive in soils; in contrast, no systematic change in delta D values is observed. The plant wax signal in soils includes averaging of inputs and diagenetic effects, so this signature is particularly relevant for the interpretation of plant wax archives in paleosols and the plant waxes eroded from soils and exported to downstream sedimentary archives. We show that soils represent the major stock of plant wax under living ecosystems, suggesting that soils may be a quantitatively-important source of plant waxes available for fluvial erosion, with implications for studies of carbon cycling and paleoenvironmental reconstructions from downstream geological archives.

The Linas de Broto depositional system consisted of a proglacial lake fed primarily by meltwater streams emanating from the small Sorrosal glacier and dammed by a lateral moraine of the Ara trunk glacier. The resulting glacio-fiuviolacustrine sequence, around 55 m thick, is divided into five lithological units consisting of braided fluvial (gravel deposits), lake margin (gravel and sand deltaic deposits) and distal lake (silt and clay laminites) facies associations. Evolution of the depositional environment reflects three phases of progradation of a high-energy braided fluvial system separated by two phases of rapid expansion of the lake. Fluvial progradation occurred during short periods of ice melting. Lake expansion concurred with ice-dam growth of the trunk glacier. The first lake expansion occurred over a time range between 55 +/- 9 ka and 49 +/- 11 ka, and is consistent with the age of the Viu lateral moraine (49 +/- 8 ka), which marks the maximum areal extent of the Ara glacier during the Last Glacial Cycle. These dates confirm that the maximum areal extent of the glacier occurred during Marine Isotope Stages 4 and 3 in the south-central Pyrenees, thus before the Last Glacial Maximum. The evolution of the Linas de Broto depositional system during this maximum glacier extent was modulated by climate oscillations in the northern Iberian Peninsula, probably related to latitudinal shifts of the atmospheric circulation in the southern North Atlantic Ocean, and variations in summer insolation intensity.

J	Sun, QG; Collinson, ME; Li, CS; Wang, YF; Beerling, DJ				Sun, QG; Collinson, ME; Li, CS; Wang, YF; Beerling, DJ			Quantitative reconstruction of palaeoclimate from the Middle Miocene Shanwang flora, eastern China	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The fossil leaf flora from the Shanwang Formation, Linqu County, Shandong Province, eastern China, is diverse, abundant, well preserved and discretely spaced, all of which make it suitable for the recognition and application of leaf physiognomic characters. This article is the First study of Chinese Tertiary floras using the CLAMP (Climate Leaf Analysis Multivariate Program) approach. Numerous bedding planes yield leaf assemblages through over 20 m thickness of diatomaceous shales within the Middle Miocene Shanwang Formation. The diatomaceous shales, containing abundant fossils, have been divided into 19 units. A working platform (3 x 3 m) in the Diatomite Quarry of Shanwang was studied for about 3 months in 1998 and as many fossils as possible were recorded layer by layer. This collecting method, used for the first time in the history of Shanwang research, enabled us to record the presence or absence of megafossils in distinct units so that we could investigate leaf physiognomic characteristics and palaeoclimate for each time interval. Leaf fossils from six units (5, 6, 7, 13, 15 and 16) have been used to estimate palaeoclimate parameters of the Shanwang area using the CLAMP 3B dataset. The predicted climate is that of a lakeside setting, at over 1000 m above sea level and within the 17-15-Ma time interval. Meteorological factors have been estimated using the CLAMP approach, including mean annual temperature (MAT 9.5-11.2degreesC), warmest month mean temperature (20.2-22.5degreesC), growing season length (5.9-6.8 months), mean growing season precipitation (83-165 cm) and relative humidity (73-79%). MAT estimates from leaf margin analysis (LMA) range from 12.5 to 15.2degreesC, which are a maximum of 4degrees higher than those from our CLAMP analyses and from previous results of LMA studies of the Shanwang flora (10-13degreesC). Nearest living relatives (NLR) of other biota (pollen, fish, insects, diatoms, microthyriaceous fungi, etc.) indicate warm and moist temperate to subtropical conditions in the Shanwang area during the Miocene. CLAMP predictions are similar to the climate predicted from NLRs although the MAT prediction is a few degrees cooler. The fact that the Shanwang leaf flora is from a lacustrine sequence may have biased the CLAMP analysis towards cooler (and possibly wetter) climates. The modern Yangtze River valley is a reasonable environmental analogue for the Shanwang Middle Miocene, though Shanwang may have had cooler summers, cooler MAT and less seasonality in rainfall. The climate was essentially constant during deposition of the sequence studied, with possible minor variations in precipitation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Application of machine learning (ML) techniques offers promising cost-effective new approaches utilizing archived remote sensing data for analyzing complex environmental data and predicting water quality parameters accurately and efficiently. The aim of this research was to leverage Landsat satellite imagery and ocean optics data from Aqua MODIS in conjunction with ML techniques to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of chlorophyll-a (Chla) estimation in the Mississippi Sound with a focus on variability driven by seasonal patterns, riverine inputs, and ocean biogeochemical parameters. Using a robust ML model based on an ensemble model, Extra Trees (ET), we estimated Chla concentrations across twelve months and evaluated the model's performance against other ML regression-based models. The ET model consistently provided accurate and reliable predictions, achieving an R-2 of 0.999 and a root mean square error of 0.187 mg/m(3). By capturing complex interactions influencing Chla variability, the ET model demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional empirical and regression-based methods. Model outputs showing lower Chla concentrations observed during winter months align with established seasonal trends in temperate coastal ecosystems. Conversely, the higher Chla concentrations observed along the coast are attributed to increased nutrient inputs from rivers such as the Pearl, Pascagoula, and Mobile Rivers, as well as coastal runoff and freshwater diversions from the Mississippi River. The influx of freshwater increased levels of nutrients, total suspended solids, phytoplankton, and total organic carbon, which resulted in higher light extinction and diminished light penetration to the seabed. This research improves our comprehension of Chla fluctuations in the Mississippi Sound and showcases the promise of cutting-edge machine learning methods for monitoring and forecasting coastal ecosystems.					; ahmad, hafez/B-5642-2019; Jose, Felix/A-1770-2015	ahmad, hafez/0000-0001-9490-9335; Jose, Felix/0000-0002-9892-0950													1866-6280	1866-6299				APR	2025	84	7							172	10.1007/s12665-025-12191-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-025-12191-7													WOS:001447421100005

The Erta Ale is offset by about 20 and 40 km from the two en echelon ridges to the south. The offset area is highly seismic and marked by a depression filled by lake Afrera, a saline body of water fed by hydrothermal springs. Acoustic bathymetric profiles show approximate to 80 m deep canyons parallel to the NNW shore of the lake, part of a system of extensional normal faults striking parallel to the Red Sea. This system is intersected by oblique structures, some with strike-slip earthquakes, in what might evolve into a transform boundary. Given that the lake's surface lies today about 112 m below sea level, the depressed (minus, approximate to 190 m below sea level) lake's bottom area may be considered the equivalent of the "nodal deep" in slow-slip oceanic transforms. The chemistry of the lake is compatible with the water having originated from hydrothermal liquids that had reacted with evaporites and basalts, rather than residual from evaporation of sea water. Bottom sediments include calcitic grains, halite and gypsum, as well as ostracod and diatom tests. The lake's level appears to have dropped by over 10 m during the last approximate to 50 years, continuing a drying up trend of the last few thousand years, after a "wet" stage 9,800 and 7,800 years before present when according to (1973) Lake Afrera covered an area several times larger than at present. This "wet" stage corresponds to an early Holocene warm-humid climate that prevailed in Saharan and Sub Saharan Africa. Lake Abhe, located roughly 250 km south of Afrera, shows similar climate-driven oscillations of its level.					; Vigliotti, Luigi/AAX-2638-2020; Gasperini, Luca/B-8796-2017; Polonia, Alina/F-4801-2018; Vaselli, Orlando/A-4268-2016	Vigliotti, Luigi/0000-0002-4160-8958; Gasperini, Luca/0000-0002-0276-0607; Bonatti, Enrico/0000-0001-6162-9572; Polonia, Alina/0000-0002-1700-453X; Vaselli, Orlando/0000-0001-8121-4438; 													2405-8440					MAY	2017	3	5							e00301	10.1016/j.heliyon.2017.e00301	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2017.e00301								28560355					WOS:000432022000007

However, these barriers may impact stream fish communities through restriction of fish movement and habitat alteration. During the summer of 1996, the fish community and habitat conditions in twenty-four stream pairs were sampled across the Great Lakes basin. Seven of these stream pairs were re-sampled in 1997. Each pair consisted of a barrier stream with a low-head barrier and a reference stream without a low-head barrier. On average, barrier streams were significantly deeper (df = 179, P = 0.0018) and wider (df = 179, P = 0.0236) than reference streams, but temperature and substrate were similar (df = 183, P = 0.9027; df = 179, P = 0.999). Barrier streams contained approximately four more fish species on average than reference streams. However, streams with low-head barriers showed a greater upstream decline in species richness compared to reference streams with a net loss of 2.4 species. Barrier streams also showed a peak in richness directly downstream of the barriers, indicating that these barriers block fish movement upstream. Using Sorenson's similarity index (based on presence/absence), a comparison of fish community assemblages above and below low-head barriers was not significantly different than upstream and downstream sites on reference streams (n = 96, P > 0.05), implying they have relatively little effect on overall fish assemblage composition. Differences in the frequency of occurrence and abundance between barrier and reference streams was apparent for some species, suggesting their sensitivity to barriers.																			0380-1330						2003	29			1			386	402		10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70502-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70502-4													WOS:000221321300029

Based on clinical signs and laboratory diagnostic findings, DCC mortality from NDV occurred in 59 of the 63 nesting colonies and two of three non-colony sites investigated. An estimate of in excess of 20,000 DCC died, with mortality rates ranging from <1 to 37% in Great Lakes colonies to 20 to 92% in Minnesota (USA) and North and South Dakota (USA) colonies. Sick juvenile white pelicans (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos) exhibiting signs similar to sick cormorants, and dead pelicans were observed in Minnesota and North Dakota. Mortality rates in pelican colonies were as high as in the adjacent cormorant colonies, but no cause for the mortality of an estimated 5,000 pelicans was determined. No evidence of NDV was found in other species nesting in proximity to affected cormorants. Although the source of the NDV infection is unknown in cormorants, the simultaneous onset of the epizootics in juvenile birds over a wide geographic area implies that the virus was acquired by adults prior to migration and was carried back to nest sites, exposing susceptible nestlings. The possible transmission of this virus from free-ranging wild birds to domestic poultry is a concern. Based on repeated epizootics in cormorants since 1990, NDV seems to be established in DCC.																			0090-3558	1943-3700				APR	1999	35	2					319	330		10.7589/0090-3558-35.2.319	http://dx.doi.org/10.7589/0090-3558-35.2.319								10231759					WOS:000080009000018

Over all watersheds, samples collected during 1976 and the spring of 1977 had median concentrations .+-. analytical SE of elements in dissolved form of 2.0 .+-. 1.8 (range 0.5-18.5), 3.1 .+-. 2.7 (0.1-11.4), 0.07 .+-. 0.06 (0-0.57) and 0.1 .+-. 0.2 (0-13.1) .mu.g/l for Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb, respectively. Respective median total concentrations were 3.9 .+-. 2.6 (range 2.4-445), 17.2 .+-. 4.9 (4.3-2500), 0.08 .+-. 0.02 (0.03-13.4) and 3.7 .+-. 1.0 (0.9-433) .mu.g/l for Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb. Concentrations of elements in dissolved form were invariable with, whereas total concentrations were proportional to, suspended sediment levels whose range was 10-19,000 mg/l with a median of 20 mg/l. Mode of transport depended on suspended sediment level. In waters with low suspended sediment levels, .apprx. 20 mg/l, the majority of Cu and Zn was transported in dissolved form; the suspended sediment accounted for most of the transport of these trace elements at higher particulate loads. Agricultural activities did not grossly contribute trace metals to the waters of these drainage systems.																			0306-7319	1029-0397					1982	11	3-4					189	210		10.1080/03067318208078311	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03067318208078311													WOS:A1982NW83100003

In order to ascertain the natural dynamics of several elements, namely Al, As, Ca, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, P, Pb, Ti and Zn, as well as the perturbations by human activities and/or global contamination, soils and sediments from four catchments (Tarn Flat, Edmonson Point, Inexpressible Island and Northern Foothills) were studied. To accomplish the above mentioned objectives, the particle-size distribution and mineralogical composition, as well as the total C, H and N contents and the total concentrations of the investigated elements were determined. Finally in order to assess metal mobility, the modified BCR three-step sequential extraction procedure was applied to the samples and the partitioning of five metals, namely Cr, Fe, Mn, Pb and Zn, into different fractions was determined. Lithology and topography are the main factors that differentiate the physicochemical characteristics of the soils and sediments investigated. The lacustrine sediments and the soils sampled around the lakes showed a similar mineralogical and chemical composition, as evidence that rock- and soil-weathering processes occur primarily during the warm summer periods, when the lakes are partially ice-free. Nevertheless the presence of chlorite in these systems indicated that chemical weathering has taken place even in these extreme conditions. In general, the geochemical composition of soils and sediments in this Antarctic area seems to be influenced mainly by the nature of the bedrock and by the input of sea-spray, and, to a lesser degree, by mechanical and chemical weathering as well as by biological processes: no evidence of a local or global anthropogenic contamination was found.

J	Lavallée, BF; Pick, FR				Lavallée, BF; Pick, FR			Picocyanobacteria abundance in relation to growth and loss rates in oligotrophic to mesotrophic lakes	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												The relative importance of growth versus loss rates of picocyanobacteria (PC) and the influence of physical and chemical variables on their in situ abundance were examined during summer 2000 in 48 lakes in Quebec, Ontario and New York State, The lakes were selected based on their trophic state. For the resulting range in total phosphorus (TP) (1 to 42 mug l(-1)), PC abundance varied from <10(2) ml(-1) in a eutrophic lake dominated by a cyanobacterial bloom to over 10(5) ml(-1) in oligotrophic and more mesotrophic lakes. Growth rates on average exceeded loss rates in the lakes with maximum rates of 1.93 and 1.25 d(-1), respectively, as estimated using a selective metabolic inhibitor method. On average the doubling time of PC was about 1.7 d, Growth rates were positively correlated with loss rates in the lakes. The multiple regression model that explained the most variation in PC abundance included SRP, loss rates, conductivity and the ratio of total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) to TP. The results suggest that biotic control of the abundance of PC may be as important as abiotic control. However, the model could only explain 44% of the variation in PC abundance among the lakes. This could be in part the result of considering PC as one ecological group when in fact considerable diversity is likely present among freshwater PC.

The aim of our research was to assess the factors that influences children's cooperation in real situations. Methods: Our target group consisted of 80 children (<16 years) who required first aid at Lake Balaton during the summer vacation in 2016. The effect of music, child-friendly equipment and rewards on compliance were observed in contrast to ordinary care. For data collection observation, documentation, Wong-Baker and PSS (Pain Severity Score) scales were used. For statistical analysis descriptive statistics,.2-test and Cramer coefficient were applied. Results: The research justified that music did not result in any positive changes in behaviour and did not decrease fear or pain, and that the documentation became more difficult. However, colourful tools and rewards led to significant improvements in the children's mood (p < 0.001), pain (p = 0.001), and behaviour (p = 0.07). Conclusions: In first aid and professional medical training more emphasis should be placed on childcare specialities, highlighting differences in applied equipment and communication. Child-friendly equipment should be widely available, such as colourful tools and simple gifts, and during treatment greater attention should be paid to creating compliance. Adequate communication could help reduce the amount of analgesic given in children's emergency care.

Dynamic monitoring of the surface water on the Tibetan Plateau is an important part of the research on the functions of the "third pole" of the earth and the Asian water tower. With the support of the Google Earth Engine cloud platform, this study used a spectral index-based fast extraction method to obtain surface water data from multi-temporal Landsat (Landsat 4, 5, and 8) satellite remote sensing images. Based on the extracted surface water data, we analyzed the spatiotemporal variations in the surface water of the Tibetan Plateau from 1980s to 2019. In this study, surface water area refers to the maximum coverage area of the surface water extracted from remote sensing images for one year, hereafter referred to as the surface water area. The results show that since 1980s, the overall surface water area of the Tibetan Plateau has increased, but not in a linear fashion. After a slight decrease from 1980s to 1995, the surface water area of the Tibetan Plateau increased steadily, except for a slight decrease in 2015, which may have been caused by the El Nino phenomenon. In terms of spatiotemporal distribution, different patterns exist in the various ecological regions of the Tibetan Plateau. The Inner ecological region had the greatest changes of surface water area among the ten ecological regions, accounting for 71.0% of the total surface water area increase from 1980s to 2019. The surface water bodies in the cold desert and the dry-winter subtropical climatic regions underwent the most changes, with their coefficients of variation being more than 20%. This study can provide data support for dynamic monitoring of surface water in the Tibetan Plateau.					; yin, ranyu/L-8247-2019	yin, ranyu/0000-0001-5594-0815; 													1672-6316	1993-0321				NOV	2021	18	11					2833	2841		10.1007/s11629-020-6482-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-020-6482-8		SEP 2021											WOS:000696453400001

These two fish species were collected in the summer 2013 in the St. Lawrence River upstream and downstream from a major WWTP, as well as in background sites (semi-remote lakes). Most of the delta N-15 variations for Sauger and Walleye are attributable to 1) delta N-15 values of the primary producers and sewage-derived particulate organic matter (SDPOM) at the base of the trophic food chain, 2) agricultural activities combined with biogeochemical processes, and 3) food web length. delta N-15 was significantly lower in fish collected in the effluent-mixed water masses than other sites of the St. Lawrence River, attributed to the SDPOM of the WWTP effluent. Relative to the background sites, certain PFAS were present at much higher levels in the St. Lawrence River, with profiles dominated by perfluoroalkyl sulfonates (PFSA). However, PFSA profiles generally remained consistent along the St. Lawrence River. PFOS levels in fish from the St. Lawrence exceeded the current Federal Environmental Quality Guidelines for protecting piscivorous mammals or birds. However, the human chronic daily intake of PFOS remained below current thresholds suggested by national agencies.

J	Loskutova, OA				Loskutova, Olga A.			Benthic invertebrate communities of lakes in the Polar Ural Mountains (Russia)	POLAR BIOLOGY												As in many Arctic regions, the fauna and biodiversity of Polar Ural lakes are not widely known. However, the fauna of these northern, relatively pristine lakes has recently become threatened due to industrial development in the Arctic. In this study, the zoobenthos of 13 relatively large lakes and 9 small ponds was studied during the summer (July and August) from 2003 to 2013. The aim was to conduct a taxonomic inventory of benthic communities in the Polar Ural lakes by combining available literature data with new information about the species composition of the zoobenthos. The lowest diversity and abundance values were found in cold deep lakes with large boulders and little algal growth, whilst the highest values were found in lakes with well-developed aquatic and riparian vegetation. In the littoral zone, Crustacea (Harpacticoida, Cyclopoida, and Cladocera) were the most abundant group, followed by Chironomidae, Nematoda, and Oligochaeta. Insects such as Plecoptera, Trichoptera, and Coleoptera accounted for only 4% of the total abundance. In the profundal zone, Chironomidae larvae and Crustacea were numerically dominant, and the share of Ostracoda was much higher than that in the littoral zone. Overall, a total of 208 invertebrate taxa (including 160 species) were recorded. The most diverse groups were Oligochaeta (43 taxa), Crustacea (36), Trichoptera (25), Mollusca (28), and Chironomidae (22). In the future, the faunas of these Arctic lakes can be used as indicators of regional and global climatic changes and in investigations of the adaptation of aquatic invertebrates to extreme environments.

J	Brander, L; Appelquist, K; Cornell, D; Andersson, UB				Brander, Linus; Appelquist, Karin; Cornell, David; Andersson, Ulf Bertil			Igneous and metamorphic geochronologic evolution of granitoids in the central Eastern Segment, southern Sweden	INTERNATIONAL GEOLOGY REVIEW												The Eastern Segment abutting the Transscandinavian Igneous Belt (TIB) mostly consists of rocks with overlapping igneous ages. In the Eastern Segment west of Lake Vattern, granitoids of clear TIB affinity exhibit strong deformational fabrics. This article presents U-Pb zircon ages from 21 samples spanning the border zone between these deformed TIB rocks in the east, and more thoroughly reworked rocks in the west. Magmatic ages fall in the range 1710-1660 million years, irrespective of the degree of deformation, confirming the overlapping crystallization ages between deformed TIB rocks and orthogneisses of the Eastern Segment. A common history is further supported by leucocratic rocks of similar ages. Prolonged orogenic (magmatic) activity is suggested by continued growth of zircon at 1.66-1.60 Ga. Six of the weakly gneissic rocks show zircons with cathodoluminescence-dark patches and embayments, possibly partly replacing metamict parts of older magmatic crystals, with Pb-207/Pb-206 ages dominantly between 1460 and 1400 million years, whereas three of the gneisses have zircon rims with calculated ages of 1440-1430 million years. Leucosome formation took place at 1443 +/- 9 and 1437 +/- 6 Ma. The minimum age of SE-NW folds was determined by an undeformed 1383 +/- 4 million years crosscutting aplitic dike. Sveconorwegian zircon growth was not found in any of the samples from the studied area. To our knowledge, 1.46-1.40 Ga metamorphism affecting the U-Pb zircon system has not previously been reported this far northeast in the Eastern Segment. We suggest that the E-W-to SE-NW-trending deformation fabrics in our field area were produced during the Hallandian-Danopolonian orogeny and escaped later, penetrative Sveconorwegian reworking.					; Andersson, Ulf B./AAK-1784-2021; Brander, Linus/AAJ-5348-2020	Cornell, David/0000-0003-3402-7765; 													0020-6814	1938-2839					2012	54	5					509	546		10.1080/00206814.2010.543785	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00206814.2010.543785													WOS:000301950400002
J	George, DG				George, DG			Remote sensing evidence for the episodic transport of phosphorus from the littoral zone of a thermally stratified lake	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Esthwaite Water in Cumbria is a small, thermally stratified lake fringed with beds of reed in the shallow littoral. In this study, we used a combination of in situ measurements and airborne remote sensing to investigate some of the physical processes influencing the transport of water and nutrients from the littoral zone. 2. The analysis of water samples collected from the reed beds, the littoral zone and the open water showed that significantly higher concentrations of dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) were frequently recorded in the reed beds in early summer. 3. Experiments with surface and near-surface free-running drogues demonstrated that the movement of water from the littoral zone was strongly influenced by the development of a secondary thermocline. When there was no secondary stratification, the surface currents generated by light winds seldom exceeded 2 cm s(-1.) When a secondary thermocline was present, surface current speeds of 5-10 cm s(-1) were recorded even when the wind speed was less than 200 cm s(-1.) 4. A series of thermal surveys using a Daedalus Airborne Thematic Mapper (ATM) demonstrated that plumes of warm water frequently developed in the littoral zone when the weather was calm. Some of these plumes covered several hundred square metres and persisted for several hours. Others were only a few metres in width and acted as episodic 'pumps' that appeared and dispersed in less than an hour.																			0046-5070					APR	2000	43	4					571	578		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2000.00540.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2000.00540.x													WOS:000086330700004

Age model for a continuous, ca 250-ka Quaternary lacustrine record from Bear Lake, Utah-Idaho	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The Quaternary sediments sampled by continuous 120-m-long drill cores from Bear Lake (Utah-Idaho) comprise one of the longest lacustrine sequences recovered from an extant lake. The cores serve as a good case study for the construction of an age model for sequences that extend beyond the range of radiocarbon dating. From a variety of potential age indicators, we selected a combination of radiocarbon ages, one magnetic excursion (correlated to a standard sequence), and a single Uranium-series age to develop an initial data set. The reliability of the excursion and U-series data require consideration of their position with respect to sediments of inferred interglacial character, but not direct correlation with other paleoclimate records. Data omitted from the age model include amino acid age estimates, which have a large amount of scatter, and tephrochronology correlations, which have relatively large uncertainties. Because the initial data set was restricted to the upper half of the BL00-1 core, we inferred additional ages by direct correlation to the independently dated paleoclimate record from Devils Hole. We developed an age model for the entire core using statistical methods that consider both the uncertainties of the original data and that of the curve-fitting process, with a combination of our initial data set and the climate correlations as control points. This age model represents our best estimate of the chronology of deposition in Bear Lake. Because the age model contains assumptions about the correlation of Bear Lake to other climate records, the model cannot be used to address some paleoclimate questions, such as phase relationships with other areas.

Atmospheric Hg deposition (precipitation + modeled vapor phase downward flux) was 425 mg ha(-1) during the one-year period March 1994 through February 1995 and 463 mg ha(-1) from March 1995 through February 1996. In the same periods, stream export of total Hg was 32 mg ha(-1) and 22 mg ha(-1), respectively. Thus, there was a net retention of Hg by the catchment of 92 % the first year and 95 % the second year. In the first year, 16.9 mg ha(-1) or about half of the annual stream export, occurred on the single day of peak spring snowmelt in April. In contrast, the maximum daily export in the second year, when peak stream flow was somewhat lower, was 3.5 mg ha(-1) during a January thaw. The fate of the Kg retained by this forested catchment is not known. Dissolved (< 0.22 mu m) Hg concentrations in stream water ranged from 0.5-2.6 ng L(-1), even when total (unfiltered) concentrations were greater than 10 ng L(-1) during high flow events. Total Hg concentrations in stream water were correlated with the total organic fraction of suspended sediment, suggesting the importance of organic material in Hg transport within the catchment. High flow events and transport with organic material may be especially important mechanisms for the movement of Hg through forested ecosystems.																			0049-6979					JUL	1998	105	1-2					427	438		10.1023/A:1005053509133	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1005053509133													WOS:000075277100040

Enhanced mercury deposition by Amazonian orographic precipitation: Evidence from high-elevation Holocene records of the Lake Titicaca region (Bolivia)	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Very few studies have focused on historical mercury (Hg) deposition in the Southern Hemisphere, especially for the pre-mining period. Therefore, the respective contributions of Hg emissions from anthropogenic and natural sources are not fully constrained and the long-term influence of climate variability is still in debate. In this study, we reconstructed Hg depositions over the last 13,500 years based on two sedimentary records located at the fringe between Amazonia and the Altiplano. Multiproxy analyses carried on the same sedimentary archives (i.e. Hg accumulation rates (AR), major elements, total organic carbon, delta C-13 and pollen analyses) show evidence that Hg deposition has risen according to Amazonian orographic moisture and precipitation during the Holocene, except for the last 200 years, for which modem industry and goldmining overwhelmed the natural signal. Comparisons with existing Hg records indicated that metallurgy and volcanic emissions were not perceptible due to the eastern down-wind position of the sites. Altogether, it argues that the historical variability of Hg deposition in the central eastern Andes has been primarily driven by changes in Amazonian moisture. At least six main phases of higher Hg AR (2.6 +/- 1.4 mu m(-2) y(-1)) compared to baseline values (0.9 +/- 0.3 mu g m(-2) y(-1)) were identified over the Holocene. During the early and late Holocene, phases of higher Hg AR coincided with wet episodes recorded in Lake Titicaca and Sajama records. During the Middle Holocene arid phase, reconstructed wetter episodes by Hg together with vegetation dynamics were attributed to the set-up of moisture niches in the eastern flanks of the Andes. Comparisons to other paleoclimatic records supports the role of North Atlantic sea-surface temperature in forcing precipitation during the late Holocene period while other mechanisms allowing moisture niches by orography are discussed for the Mid-Holocene dry phase in the eastern Andes region.					; Guédron, Stéphane/K-7692-2018; Develle, Anne-Lise/K-1352-2014; BRISSET, Elodie/M-9867-2013; Guedron, Stephane/K-7692-2018	Ledru, Marie-Pierre/0000-0002-8079-9320; BRISSET, Elodie/0000-0001-8706-0505; Guedron, Stephane/0000-0003-4229-1566													0031-0182	1872-616X				DEC 15	2018	511						577	587		10.1016/j.palaeo.2018.09.023	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2018.09.023													WOS:000452583600038

In this study, it was confirmed that DTPA is persistent toward biodegradation. The biodegradability of DTPA was investigated in the absence and in the presence of Fe(Ill) by using CO2 evolution test and Manometric respirometry test. The CO2 evolution and oxygen uptake of iron-free (DTPA was added as free acid) and Fe(III)DTPA were less than in inoculum blank. Possible inhibitor effect was analysed by testing biodegradation of sodium benzoate with and without iron-free or Fe(III)DTPA in the Manometric respirometry test. Only slight inhibition was observed when DTPA was added as free acid. Photodegradation of iron-free DTPA and Fe(III)-DTPA complex was studied by using sunlight and UV radiation at the range 315-400 nm emitted by black light lamps. The results indicate that DTPA added as free acid degrades photochemically in humic lake water. Fe(III)DTPA was shown to be very photolabile in humic lake water in the summer; the photochemical half-life was below one hour. Photodegradation products were identified by the mass spectrometric technique (GC-MS). It was shown that photodegradation of Fe(III)DTPA does not result in total mineralization of the compound. Diethylenetriaminetetraacetic acid, diethylenetriaminetriacetic acid, ethylenediaminetriacetic acid, N,N'- and/or N,N-ethylenediaminediacetic acid, iminodiacetate, ethylenediaminemonoacetic acid and glycine were identified as photodegradation products of Fe(III)DTPA. Based on these observations, we propose a photodegradation pathway for Fe(III)DTPA. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Adhikari, S; Tsai, VC				Adhikari, S.; Tsai, V. C.			A model for subglacial flooding through a preexisting hydrological network during the rapid drainage of supraglacial lakes	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												Increasingly large numbers of supraglacial lakes form and drain every summer on the Greenland Ice Sheet. Some of these lakes drain rapidly within the timescale of a few hours, and the vertical discharge of water during these events may find a preexisting film of water potentially within a distributed drainage system of linked cavities. Here we present a model for subglacial flooding applied specifically to such circumstances. One of many interesting results we find is that water flows in from the far field prior to the arrival of flooding. We systematically evaluate the effect of initial ice/bed opening on the degree of perturbation to the subglacial system. Of particular importance, we find that floods propagate much faster and vertical displacements are much greater for larger openings. For 10 and 1cm of initial opening, for example, floods travel about 68% and 50% farther than in the fully coupled ice/bed scenario after 2h of drainage, respectively. For the same choices of initial opening, the elastostatic displacement at the injection point is about 1.39 and 1.26 times that of the fully coupled scenario. Using the framework with a preexisting water film results in avoiding the pressure singularity that is inherent to classical hydrofracture models, thus opening an avenue for integrating the likes of our model within continuum subglacial hydrological models. Furthermore, we foresee that the theory presented can be used to potentially infer subglacial hydrological conditions from surface observables.					; Tsai, Victor/J-8405-2012	Adhikari, Surendra/0000-0003-1021-6860; Tsai, Victor/0000-0003-1809-6672													2169-9003	2169-9011				MAR	2015	120	3					580	603		10.1002/2014JF003339	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2014JF003339													WOS:000353694200011
J	Cvetkovic, M; Kostuk, K; Chow-Fraser, P				Cvetkovic, Maja; Kostuk, Kristina; Chow-Fraser, Patricia			Gear-Type Influences on Fish Catch and a Wetland Fish Index in Georgian Bay Wetlands	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												The Laurentian Great Lakes are managed by many jurisdictions that use a variety of survey methods and gear types to monitor fish assemblages in coastal marshes. Lack of standardization in these methods makes it difficult for organizations to compare data because of inherent biases in gear types. Of equal concern is the uncertainty of the effect of gear bias on fish-related index scores for ecosystem health. Our first objective was to investigate whether there were differences in catch data between two commonly used sampling gears: fyke nets (FN) and boat electrofishing (EF). Secondly, we investigated whether catch differences in data associated with gear biases can lead to significant differences when these data are used to generate scores for biotic indices such as the published Wetland Fish Index (WFI). We sampled 26 coastal wetlands in Georgian Bay (Lake Huron) in the summers of 2004 and 2005. A majority (73%) of the more than 10,000 fish were caught by FN; this gear also captured a greater number of species and functional taxa and selected for larger piscivores. By comparison, EF captured larger invertivores. Fyke nets were more selective for individuals from the Centrarchidae, Cyprinidae, and Ictaluridae families, while EF was more effective for darters (e.g., the Iowa darter Etheostoma exile and johnny darter E. nigrum) and white suckers Catostomus commersonii. Despite these biases in catch data, we obtained statistically similar WFI scores with both gear types. Therefore, although the fish abundance and species composition information collected from FN and EF are not directly comparable, when necessary they can be used interchangeably to generate a fish-based index of ecosystem health.																			0275-5947	1548-8675					2012	32	2					313	324		10.1080/02755947.2012.678560	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02755947.2012.678560													WOS:000303601100012

Holocene interdependences of changes in sea surface temperature, productivity, and fluvial inputs in the Iberian continental shelf (Tagus mud patch)	GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS												Sea surface temperature (SST), marine productivity, and fluvial input have been reconstructed for the last 11.5 calendar (cal) ka B. P. using a high-resolution study of C-37 alkenones, coccolithophores, iron content, and higher plant n-alkanes and n-alkan-1-ols in sedimentary sequences from the inner shelf off the Tagus River Estuary in the Portuguese Margin. The SST record is marked by a continuous decrease from 19 degrees C, at 10.5 and 7 ka, to 15 degrees C at present. This trend is interrupted by a fall from 18 degrees C during the Roman and Medieval Warm Periods to 16 degrees C in the Little Ice Age. River input was very low in the early Holocene but increased in the last 3 cal ka B. P. in association with an intensification of agriculture and deforestation and possibly the onset of the North Atlantic Oscillation/Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation modes of variability. River influence must have reinforced the marine cooling trend relative to the lower amplitude in similar latitude sites of the eastern Atlantic. The total concentration of alkenones reflects river-induced productivity, being low in the early Holocene but increasing as river input became more important. Rapid cooling, of 1-2 degrees C occurring in 250 years, is observed at 11.1, 10.6, 8.2, 6.9, and 5.4 cal ka B. P. The estimated age of these events matches the ages of equivalent episodes common in the NE Atlantic-Mediterranean region. This synchronicity reveals a common widespread climate feature, which considering the twentieth century analog between colder SSTs and negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), is likely to reflect periods of strong negative NAO.

J	Pazos, PJ				Pazos, PJ			The late carboniferous glacial to postglacial transition: Facies and sequence stratigraphy, western Paganzo Basin, Argentina	GONDWANA RESEARCH												Namurian-early Westphalian glacial-postglacial deposits have beers documented in the Paganzo Basin, Argentina, but integrated sequence stratigraphic and sedimentological analyses of the glacial-postglacial transition are rare. In the Cuesta de Huaco section the glacial-postglacial transition encompasses the lower sequence of the existing schemes. Glacioeustatic changes in sea-level controlled the architecture and vertical arrangement of facies. The basal sequence boundary is coeval with the onset of glaciation when sea level fell, contemporaneous with glacial erosion and bypass of sediment. The upper sequence boundary is a high-frequency sequence boundary. The basal deposits are interpreted as an early transgressive systems tract (ETST) initiated during glacial retreat. The interval fines upward, contains current reworked diamictites, conglomerates and sandstones deposited in a subglacial to proglacial environment (Facies I-II) and ice-rafted glaciomarine rhythmites (Facies III). Postglacial brackish-marine black shales (Facies IV) represent the late transgressive systems tract (LTST). Micritic-limestone beds were deposited during a period of sediment starvation coeval with the maximum marine inundation in the basin (MFZ). It marks a turnaround in the stacking pattern that became coarsening and thickening upward during the overlying highstand systems tract (HST). It consists of fine-grained turbidites (Facies V) and classical turbidites with wave reworked beds at the top (Facies VI) deposited in a shallow deltaic systems. Intervening postglacial brackish deposits contain an ichnofauna dominated by trackways of arthropods and minor grazing traces, preserved in bedding planes, that resemble nonmarine ichnocoenoses and differ from the archetypal brackish ichnofaunas, even when palynological data support the saline-depleted environment.

J	Ayris, PM; Delmelle, P				Ayris, Paul Martin; Delmelle, Pierre			The immediate environmental effects of tephra emission	BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY												The Earth's history is punctuated by large explosive eruptions that eject large quantities of magma and silicate rock fragments into the atmosphere. These tephra particles can sometimes be dispersed across millions of square kilometres or even entire continents. The interaction of tephra with or in receiving environments may induce an array of physical, chemical and biological effects. The consequences for affected systems and any dependent communities may be chronic and localised in the event of frequent, small eruptions, while larger and rarer events may have acute, regional-scale impacts. It is, therefore, necessary to document the range of possible impacts that tephra may induce in receiving environments and any resulting effects in interconnected systems. We collate results from many studies to offer a detailed multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary review of the immediate post-eruptive effects of tephra emission into the atmosphere, onto vegetation, soil or ice/snow surfaces and in aquatic systems. We further consider the repercussions that may be induced in the weeks to years afterwards. In the atmosphere, tephra can influence cloud properties and air chemistry by acting as ice nuclei (IN) or by offering sites for heterogeneous reactions, respectively. Tephra on vegetation causes physical damage, and sustained coverage may elicit longer-term physiological responses. Tephra deposits on soils may alter their capacity to exchange gas, water and heat with the atmosphere or may have a specific chemical effect, such as nutrient input or acidification, on sensitive soils. Tephra deposition onto snow or ice may affect ablation rates. Rivers and lakes may experience turbidity increases and changes in their morphology as a result of fallout and prolonged (months or years) erosion from the tephra-covered catchment. In the first weeks after deposition, tephra leaching may affect river chemistry. The abundance and speciation of phytoplankton populations in lakes may be altered by tephra-induced changes in water chemistry or sediment-water nutrient cycling. In the oceans, tephra deposition may fertilise Fe-limited waters, with potential impacts on the global carbon cycle. Embracing the full complexity of environmental effects caused by tephra fall demands a renewed investigative effort drawing on interdisciplinary field and laboratory studies, combined with consideration of the interconnectivity of induced impacts within and between different receiving environments.

There are two main purposes on this paper: interpreting the current performance of the piezometric level of the wetland from different environmental variables and predicting climate change in the small-lake by the end of the 21st century. Thus, an explanatory and a predictive model were developed. Although the methodological approach for both types of models is similar, based on multivariate linear regression analysis, the models developed for each of the purposes were different, due to the greater availability of data for environmental variables in the recent past than for making predictions based on climate change scenarios. The results from the explanatory model of the current performance of the small-lake indicate that the piezometric level depends on the accumulated precipitation over long periods of time (from 6 to 10 months), as well as the potential evapotranspiration recorded in the previous 10 months. The models developed for predicting the future intra-annual performance, based on different scenarios and climatic models, suggest that the piezometric level of the lagoon will fall drastically 1-1.5 meters regardless the model of climate change or the emssions scenario.					espejo, jose/ABH-3203-2020; Barrera, César/AAA-2215-2022; Fraile Jurado, Pablo/K-2140-2014; Barrera, César/K-8561-2014; Jurado, Pablo/AAO-5072-2021	Fraile Jurado, Pablo/0000-0002-0382-0931; 													0014-1496	1988-8546				JAN-JUN	2019	80	286							e008	10.3989/estgeogr.201928.008	http://dx.doi.org/10.3989/estgeogr.201928.008													WOS:000498398600008

Sedimentological analysis is supported by tephrostratigraphy to confirm the continuous, annual nature of the laminae, and a master varve chronology places proxies from multiple lake cores in a secure geochronology. Varve thickness is controlled by the rate of glacial erosion and efficiency of subglacial discharge from the adjacent Langjokull ice cap. The continuous presence of glacially derived clastic varves in the sediment fill confirms that the ice cap has occupied the lake catchment for the duration of the record. Varve thickness, varve thickness variance, ice-rafted debris, total organic carbon (mass flux and bulk concentration), and C:N of sedimentary organic matter, reveal a dynamic late Holocene climate with abrupt and large-scale changes in ice-cap size and landscape stability. A first-order trend toward cooler summers and ice-cap expansion is punctuated by notable periods of rapid ice cap growth and/or landscape instability at ca 1000 BC, 600 BC, 550 AD and 1250 AD. The largest perturbation began ca 1250 AD, signaling the onset of the Little Ice Age and the termination of three centuries of relative warmth during Medieval times. Consistent deposition of ice-rafted debris in Hvitarvatn is restricted to the last 250 years, demonstrating that Langjokull only advanced into Hvitkvatn during the coldest centuries of the Little Ice Age, beginning in the mid eighteenth century. This advance represents the glacial maximum for at least the last 3 ka, and likely since regional deglaciation 10 ka. The multi-centennial response of biological proxies to the Hekla 3 tephra deposition illustrates the significant impact of large explosive eruptions on local environments, and catchment sensitivity to perturbations.

In addition, genetic analysis of the phycocyanin operon of Planktothrix sp, FP1 revealed a novel primary structure, previously undescribed within the cyanobacteria, which was used as a genetic marker for rapid detection and identification of this toxic strain. The occurrence of saxitoxin (STX), a principal toxin in paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), was confirmed in the natural bloom sample by both pre-column and post-column derivatization high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses, and eventually by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). The toxicity of this field sample was also revealed by electrophysiological assays in which the extract inhibited 90% of the voltage-dependent Na+ current in human neuroblastoma cells at the STX concentration of 80 nM, The cultured strain showed a lower physiologic activity than the bloom sample (67% blockage of Na+ current at a toxin concentration of 200 nM), and STX was detected only by pre-column HPLC, indicating the presence of a compound structurally close to STX. Chemical and molecular genetic analyses performed here add Planktothrix sp, FP1 to the growing list of diverse cyanobacterial species capable of synthesizing STX and its related compounds.

J	Subin, ZM; Riley, WJ; Mironov, D				Subin, Zachary M.; Riley, William J.; Mironov, Dmitrii			An improved lake model for climate simulations: Model structure, evaluation, and sensitivity analyses in CESM1	JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS												Lakes can influence regional climate, yet most general circulation models have, at best, simple and largely untested representations of lakes. We developed the Lake, Ice, Snow, and Sediment Simulator (LISSS) for inclusion in the land-surface component (CLM4) of an earth system model (CESM1). The existing CLM4 lake model performed poorly at all sites tested; for temperate lakes, summer surface water temperature predictions were 10-25 degrees C lower than observations. CLM4-LISSS modifies the existing model by including (1) a treatment of snow; (2) freezing, melting, and ice physics; (3) a sediment thermal submodel; (4) spatially variable prescribed lake depth; (5) improved parameterizations of lake surface properties; (6) increased mixing under ice and in deep lakes; and (7) correction of previous errors. We evaluated the lake model predictions of water temperature and surface fluxes at three small temperate and boreal lakes where extensive observational data was available. We also evaluated the predicted water temperature and/or ice and snow thicknesses for ten other lakes where less comprehensive forcing observations were available. CLM4-ISSS performed very well compared to observations for shallow to medium-depth small lakes. For large, deep lakes, the under-prediction of mixing was improved by increasing the lake eddy diffusivity by a factor of 10, consistent with previous published analyses. Surface temperature and surface flux predictions were improved when the aerodynamic roughness lengths were calculated as a function of friction velocity, rather than using a constant value of 1 mm or greater. We evaluated the sensitivity of surface energy fluxes to modeled lake processes and parameters. Large changes in monthly-averaged surface fluxes (up to 30 W m(-2)) were found when excluding snow insulation or phase change physics and when varying the opacity, depth, albedo of melting lake ice, and mixing strength across ranges commonly found in real lakes. Typical variation among model parameterization choices can therefore cause persistent local surface flux changes much larger than expected changes in greenhouse forcing. We conclude that CLM4-LISSS adequately simulates lake water temperature and surface energy fluxes, with errors comparable in magnitude to those resulting from uncertainty in global lake properties, and is suitable for inclusion in global and regional climate studies.					; Riley, William/D-3345-2015; Mironov, Denis/AAM-4014-2021; Subin, Zachary/K-5168-2012	Subin, Zachary M/0009-0004-2244-6545; Mironov, Dmitrii/0000-0002-3228-5851; 													1942-2466					FEB 29	2012	4								M02001	10.1029/2011MS000072	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2011MS000072													WOS:000303198800001

Boron circulation and recharge pattern in Zabuye drainage basin, Tibetan plateau	4TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WATER RESOURCE AND ENVIRONMENT (WRE 2018)	IOP Conference Series-Earth and Environmental Science				4th International Conference on Water Resource and Environment (WRE)	JUL 17-21, 2018	I Shou Univ, Kaohsiung, TAIWAN		I Shou Univ			Zabuye salt lake is famous for abundance of B and Li resource, especially for natural product of lithium carbonate mineral. Based on systematic measurement of chemical compositions and boron isotope, the fractionation mechanisms of boron were discussed to constrain possible boron cycle among different reservoirs. The excellent consistency of borax isotopic composition on the basis of fractionation between hydroboracite and borax and basicboron structure indicates that boron isotopic fractionation occurred during lake water evolution, such as crystallization, adsorption, and alteration processes. The increase of delta B-11 values in brine with corresponding pH varying from 9.86 to 9.01 suggests that pH has predominent control over the separation because B-11 will preferentially concentrated in trigonal (B(OH)(3)) species. Very low delta B-11 values of brine in Zabuye salt lake imply a negative origin as almost all natural geochemical processes will result in positive values without any other extra boron input. Similar fractionation factor between carbonate-rich clay and brine to that between sediment and brine in other salt lakes in Tibetan Plateau also strongly support the accumulation of boron from the input of carbonate-rich clay. Unlike the consecutive evaporation in Bange salt lake with relatively positive delta B-11 values, Zabuye salt lake has experienced crystallization from initial brine and subsequent redissolution of carbonate-rich clay processes and the extracted boron is carried into the lake by river water and rising springs.																			1755-1307						2018	191								012129	10.1088/1755-1315/191/1/012129	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/191/1/012129													WOS:000467867600129

The analyses of pollen, organic matters, TOC, and Rb/Sr indicate a high degree of peat humification and thus strong decomposition of organic matter when climate was dry. Conversely, when climate was humid, the degree of humification is low because peat was preserved in a waterlogged condition. Peat humification from Dajiuhu occurred not only during the Younger Dryas (about 11.4-12.6 cal ka BP), the Bolling-Allerod Warm Period (12.6-15.2 cal ka BP), and the Oldest Dryas (about 15.2-16.0 cal ka BP), but also during the early Holocene (about 11.4-9.4 cal ka BP), the 8.2 cal ka BP cold event, and the Holocene Optimum (about 7.0-4.2 cal ka BP). Both peat humification records since nearly 5 ka BP are consistent, showing that mountain peatland has synchronous responses to the East Asia monsoon-induced precipitation. The LOI data confirm the above observation. The monsoon precipitation since nearly 5 ka BP recorded in these two peat profiles can be divided into three phases. During 4.9-3.5 ka BP, precipitation amount was high but fluctuated greatly. During 3.5-0.9 ka BP, precipitation amount was low. During 0.9-0 ka BP, degree of humification reduced gradually, indicating the increase of monsoon precipitation. Contrast to other high-resolution records from East China monsoon region shows that the monsoon precipitation records of the two peat profiles since nearly 16 ka BP are controlled by a common forcing mechanism of summer solar radicalization in the Northern Hemisphere.

Aims To compare the breeding ecology of two Japanese populations, and with breeding data from Polish sites. Methods We studied two sites in 1996. The Seimei site comprises a natural reed-bed (Phragmites australis) (2.0 ha) c. 2 km from residential areas. The Sakura site occurs as smaller reed-bed (0.8 ha) close to residential areas. Field study comprised mainly nest searching and nest monitoring. Results Breeding density, nest height, number of stems supporting nest, clutch size and brood size were not significantly different between sites. The proportion of nests built on reed stems standing in the water (60%) was significantly higher at the Seimei site (P < 0.001), and the warblers in this habitat experienced significantly higher nesting failure (P < 0.05). Predation was a principal cause of failure at both sites. Significantly more nests suffered from predation at Seimei (53%) than at Sakura (16%). Breeding density was higher at both sites compared with European populations but it fell within ranges of other Japanese populations. Mean first-egg date of first brood does not differ between our sites and Polish ones. Conclusion The differences between the two Japanese populations and between Japanese and Polish populations were relatively small and were seen mainly in nest losses, breeding density and proportion of nests built over water.																			0006-3657					JUL	2002	49		2				166	171		10.1080/00063650209461261	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00063650209461261													WOS:000176685100010

Understanding long-term ecosystem reorganizations in response to past environmental changes is crucial to draw conclusions about the impact of future climate change. So far, it has been difficult to address the post-deglaciation timing and ecosystem dynamics due to a lack of well-dated and continuous sediment sequences covering the entire period after the LGM. Here, we present a new paleoecological study with exceptional chronological time control using pollen, spores and microscopic charcoal from Moossee (Swiss Plateau, 521 m a.s.l.) to reconstruct the vegetation and fire history over the last ca. 19 000 years. After lake formation in response to deglaciation, five major pollen-inferred ecosystem rearrangements occurred at ca. 18 800 cal BP (establishment of steppe tundra), 16 000 cal BP (spread of shrub tundra), 14 600 cal BP (expansion of boreal forests), 11 600 cal BP (establishment of the first temperate deciduous tree stands composed of, e.g., Quercus, Ulmus, Alnus) and 8200 cal BP (first occurrence of mesophilous Fagus sylvatica trees). These vegetation shifts were caused by climate changes at ca. 19 000, 16 000, 14 700, 11 700 and 8200 cal BP. Vegetation responses occurred with no apparent time lag to climate change when the mutual chronological uncertainties are considered. This finding is in agreement with further evidence from southern and central Europe and might be explained by the proximity to the refugia of boreal and temperate trees (< 400 km) and rapid species spreads. Our palynological record sets the beginning of millennial-scale land use with periodically increased fire and agricultural activities of the Neolithic period at ca. 7000 cal BP. Subsequently, humans rather than climate triggered changes in vegetation composition and structure. We conclude that Fagus sylvatica forests were resilient to long-term anthropogenic and climatic impacts of the Mid and the Late Holocene. However, future climate warming and in particular declining moisture availability may cause unprecedented reorganizations of central European beech-dominated forest ecosystems.

J	Prasuhn, V; Sieber, U				Prasuhn, V; Sieber, U			Changes in diffuse phosphorus and nitrogen inputs into surface waters in the Rhine watershed in Switzerland	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Using the regional scale, nutrient-flow simulation model MODIFFUS, an estimate of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) inputs from diffuse sources into surface waters over the Swiss part of the Rhine watershed downstream of large lakes was performed for the years 1985, 1996 and 2001. The data are required for purposes of national monitoring and for reporting to international panels such as the International Commission for the Protection of the Rhine (ICPR) and the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR). Total diffuse P and N losses, including natural background losses, decreased from 547 tons (t) P and 19 219 t N in 1985, to 423 t P and 17 902 t N in 1996, and 393 t P and 16 610 t N in 2001. Total reductions between 1985 and 2001 of 154 t P and 2 609 t N corresponded to 28% and 14% of the total diffuse, and 38% and 18% of the anthropogenic diffuse losses, respectively. These reductions are mainly attributable due to a decrease in agricultural land and partly to measures in agricultural practice. However, discharges from point sources (wastewater treatment plants and stormwater overflows) also have fallen substantially over the period. Over the Swiss part of the Rhine watershed, the international target of 50% reduction in the total inputs into surface waters of P and N was achieved for P (reduction of 51%), but not for N (reduction of 23%). Comparison of the calculated losses of P and N from all sources with the loads measured in the Rhine near Basel shows the calculations to be realistic.

Exteriors of more than 2000 trees 1.0-15.0 in. (2.5-38 cm) dbh [diameter breast height] were examined for 35 defects of 6 types. Interiors of more than 400 dissected stems were also examined. Growing stock quality of trees .gtoreq. 4.0 in. (10.2 cm) dbh was rated according to a 4-class system based mainly on number of major visible defects. In all species the majority of trees fell in class 4, very poor quality. Impact of different defects on quality was examined by comparing observed tree classes with those that would have existed if each defect type were absent. Quality grain in sugar maple, yellow birch and red maple was greatest when branchiness-forkedness-holes were omitted. Branchiness was the most prevalent defect; in sugar maple percentage of trees affected increased with dbh up to the 10 in. (25.4-cm) dbh class. Harvest and vertebrate scars, disease and direct insect damage had negligible impacts. Evidence was found in sugar maple stem interiors that branchiness and forkedness usually developed where terminals were destroyed. Preserved signs of the bud miners Proteoteras moffatiana and Obrussa ochrefasciella pointed to terminal-feeding insects as a major indirect cause of branchiness-forkedness-holes. Some locally destructive agents proved unimportant on a regional scale.																			0015-749X	1938-3738					1978	24	2					247	259																WOS:A1978FK21700012

Detection and quantification of Microcystis spp. and microcystin-LR in Western Lake Erie during the summer of 2007	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Microcystis spp. blooms have occurred annually in western Lake Erie since about 1995. Microcystis produce a group of toxins known as microcystins which can be harmful to livestock and to humans. In this study, surface water samples were collected from six sites during six sampling events from July to October in 2007. In situ environmental data (e.g. pH, temperature) and laboratory analyses (e.g. nutrients) were carried out to characterize the six sites. The Microcystis spp. density ranged from 10(2) to 10(7) cells/ml. Microcystin-LR concentration of 20 of all 36 samples were below the detection limit (0.15-5 ppb), while the microcystin-LR concentration in the 16 remaining samples ranged from 0.5 to 3 x 10(3) mu g per gram dry weight. The aim of this research was to investigate the relationships between sampling location, environmental parameters, Microcystis spp. concentration, and microcystin-LR concentration. The results suggest that temperature, nutrient concentration, turbidity, and wind speed and direction (P < 0.05) are factors which affected Microcystis spp. density. Sampling site 8M, located 13 m from the Maumee River, provided an advantage for Microcystis spp. growth, presumably due to intermediate water depth (5.5 m) combined with impact from the river. No relationship was found between Microcystis spp. density and microcystin-LR concentration. Temperature, nutrient concentration and DO (P < 0.05) were associated with the production of microcystin-LR.

J	WORONA, MA; WHITLOCK, C				WORONA, MA; WHITLOCK, C			LATE QUATERNARY VEGETATION AND CLIMATE HISTORY NEAR LITTLE LAKE, CENTRAL COAST RANGE, OREGON	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												Pollen and plant macrofossils recovered from Little Lake, Oregon, pro;ide the first record of late Quaternary climate and vegetation changes in Oregon's central Coast Range. The pollen data suggest that the period from ca. 42 000 to 24 770 yr B.P. featured an open forest of western white pine, western hemlock, and fir. The inferred climate was cooler and wetter than today. The full-glacial period was characterized by a parkland of spruce, lodgepole pine, and mountain hemlock, which suggests that the climate was colder and possibly drier than today. The Oregon Coast Range was not a glacial refugium for temperate conifers as has been proposed. By 16 000 yr B.P. the pollen and plant macrofossil data suggest the development of a montane forest composed of pine, fir, western hemlock, and mountain hemlock. Temperate taxa were present in the vegetation at 13 500 yr B.P. during a period of climatic amelioration. A reversal in this warming trend may have occurred between 11 000 and 10 500 yr B.P., when pine, western and mountain hemlock, and spruce were slightly more abundant. Early Holocene forests featured Douglas fir, red alder, and bracken fern, implying more severe summer drought and more frequent fires. After 5600 yr B.P., Douglas fir, western hemlock, and western red cedar dominated the record, marking the introduction of the present-day cool, moist climate; however, during the past 2800 yr, increased Douglas fir and decreased cedar suggest the possibility of reduced effective moisture at Little Lake.																			0016-7606					JUL	1995	107	7					867	876		10.1130/0016-7606(1995)107<0867:LQVACH>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/0016-7606(1995)107<0867:LQVACH>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1995RG18100008

Refuge managers are concerned about local water-quality effects and the amount of birdborne nutrient load that might cause eutrophication in roosting ponds and(or) be exported to downstream systems. We initiated this research effort to test the hypothesis that daily feeding migrations by geese represented a significant source of nutrients to wetland systems at the Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge in the middle Rio Grande River valley of New Mexico. We documented the role of geese in translocating nutrients through a combination of time budget and mass balance models for birds, bioassays of phytoplankton growth, and stable isotope methods that trace the source of nitrogen to food webs. Geese increased the nutrient loading rates in some wetland ponds by up to 40% for total nitrogen and 75% for total phosphorus. Bioassays revealed that nitrogen was consistently limiting to primary production by algae in the ponds. Chlorophyll levels increased in proportion to bird densities. Fish and crayfish from the ponds intensively used by birds had very low stable nitrogen signatures relative to those from the Rio Grande River. This result derived from the low N-15 in alfalfa and corn, which were the primary forage for birds, and accumulated through food webs in proportion to bird use of individual ponds as roosting areas. In general, the wetland ponds functioned efficiently in retaining the birdborne, allochthonous nutrient load and only modest amounts of the total nitrogen or phosphorus were exported downstream.

In all of the cases Studied, the rectangular tank of liquid has a width-to-depth ratio of 2. The first set of results are based on an inviscid, fully nonlinear finite difference free-surface model. The model equations are mapped from the physical domain onto a rectangular domain. Case studies at and off resonance are presented illustrating when linear theory is inadequate. The next set of results are concerned with analyzing internal waves induced by sloshing a density-stratified liquid. Nonlinear viscous flow equations are solved. Two types of breaking are discussed. One is associated with a shear instability which causes overturning on the lee side of a wave that moves towards the center of the container; this wave is generated as the dominant sloshing mode recedes from the sidewall towards the end of the first sloshing cycle. The other is associated with the growth of a convective instability that initiates the formation of a lip of heavier fluid above lighter fluid behind the crest of the primary wave as it moves up the sidewall. The lip grows into a bore-like structure as it plunges downward. It falls downward behind the primary wave as the primary wave moves up the sidewall and ahead of the primary wave as this wave recedes from the sidewall. This breaking event occurs near the end of the first cycle of sloshing, which is initiated from a state of rest by sinusoidal forcing.					; Frandsen, Jannette/HTP-5424-2023	Frandsen, Jannette/0000-0003-3348-0859; 													0892-7219	1528-896X				MAY	2005	127	2					141	149		10.1115/1.1894415	http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/1.1894415													WOS:000230026000009

Although metagenomics has expanded our understanding of their diversity and ecological roles played in marine environments, little is known about GVs of freshwater ecosystems. Most previous studies have employed short-read sequencing and therefore resulted in fragmented genomes, hampering accurate assessment of genetic diversity. We sought to bridge this knowledge gap and overcome previous technical limitations. We subjected spatiotemporal (2 depths x 12 months) samples from Lake Biwa to metagenome-assembled genome reconstruction enhanced by long-read metagenomics. This yielded 293 GV metagenome-assembled genomes. Of these, 285 included previously unknown species in five orders of nucleocytoviruses and the first representatives of freshwater mirusviruses, which exhibited marked divergence from marine-derived lineages. The good performance of our long-read metagenomic assembly was demonstrated by the detection of 42 (14.3%) genomes composed of single contigs with completeness values >90%. GVs were partitioned across water depths, with most species specific to either the sunlit epilimnion or the dark hypolimnion. Epilimnion-specific members tended to be transient and exhibit short and intense abundance peaks, in line with the fact that they regulate the surface algal blooms. During the spring bloom, mirusviruses and members of three nucleocytovirus families were among the most abundant viruses. In contrast, hypolimnion-specific ones, including a mirusvirus genome, were typically more persistent in the hypolimnion throughout the water-stratified period, suggesting that they infect hosts specific to the hypolimnion and play previously unexplored ecological roles in dark water microbial ecosystems.					; meng, lingjie/KRQ-3485-2024	Ogata, Hiroyuki/0000-0001-6594-377X; Okazaki, Yusuke/0000-0001-8770-2774; Meng, Lingjie/0000-0001-9937-8860													1751-7362	1751-7370				OCT 7	2024	18	1							wrae182	10.1093/ismejo/wrae182	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ismejo/wrae182								39312489					WOS:001330776900001

Spawning salmon increase brook trout movements in a Lake Michigan tributary	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Salmon and trout have been introduced to many ecosystems worldwide, yet the ecological impacts of salmonid introductions remain poorly understood. We investigated the effects of introduced Pacific salmon on stream-resident fish in the Great Lakes basin by monitoring the movements of passive integrative transponder (PIT)-tagged brook trout in a Lake Michigan tributary receiving a salmon spawning run and in a nearby stream not receiving salmon. Coincident with the September arrival of salmon, an estimated 52% of resident brook trout moved > 200 m, while no such movements were detected in the nonsalmon stream. After 3-4 days, however, brook trout movement patterns became similar in the two streams, suggesting that salmon effects on brook trout movements were short-lived. Movements in the salmon stream were predominantly upstream in direction, with 50% of the tagged brook trout travelling from below to above the stationary PIT tag readers during the study. Declining water temperatures with the onset of fall coincided with low levels of brook trout movement at both sites, likely due to relocation for spawning. Increased brook trout movements coincident with the arrival of salmon spawners could be driven by a combination of interference competition and egg consumption. Using a bioenergetics model, we estimated that the energy lost to movement was likely compensated by the energy obtained from consuming salmon eggs. We conclude that salmon spawners can substantially increase brook trout movement, but in our study, these effects were short-lived and likely negligible from a bioenergetics perspective.

Eggs and milt were stripped from spawning lake trout collected in the fall of 1980 from southeastern Lake Michigan, northwestern Lake Huron, south central Lake Superior, and from hatchery brood stock. Eggs from all sources were incubated, and the newly hatched fry were reared for 139 days in lake water from each of the three upper Great Lakes and in well water. Survival of eggs to hatching at all sites was lowest for those from Lake Michigan (70% of fertilized eggs) and highest for eggs from Lake Superior (96%). Comparisons of incubation water from the different lakes indicated that hatching success of eggs from all sources was highest in Lake Huron water, and lowest in Lake Michigan water. The most notable finding was the nearly total mortality of fry from eggs of southeastern Lake Michigan lake trout. At all sites, the mean survival of Lake Michigan fry through 139 days after hatching was only 4% compared to near 50% for fry from the other three sources. In a comparison of the rearing sites, little influence of water quality on fry survival was found. Thus, the poor survival was associated with the source of eggs and sperm, not the water in which the fry were reared.																			0380-1330						1985	11	4					520	529		10.1016/S0380-1330(85)71796-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(85)71796-0													WOS:A1985AXC3300011

A new instream flow assessment method based on fuzzy habitat suitability and large scale river modelling	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE												This paper proposes an integrated tool for the assessment of fish habitat suitability based on synthetic hydraulic and water quality parameters. There are three innovative features in this study: (a) The proposed approach seeks to improve the capabilities of IFIM (Instream Flow Incremental Methodology) by extending the assessment to a larger spatial scale, which can be helpful for river managers in decision making. (b) The method is based on the suitability response of target species to hydraulic and water quality parameters through a fuzzy model, which is a novel application of a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy logic. (c) The introduction of simulated river conditions enables the generation of a wide range of scenarios and the detection of potentially critical situations. After introducing the main algorithm, a sensitivity analysis is provided for the assessment of critical river segments and for ranking the influence of each parameter on the habitat. Then, a second algorithm is developed to produce an instream flow assessment method by determining the range of admissible flows that preserve the habitat suitability to a prescribed degree. The combined method is demonstrated with the application to two Italian rivers in the Tuscany region. In the case of the Arno River, the method highlights the habitat diversity for the two target species along its course, and the critical conditions that may develop during the summer low flow. In the case of the Serchio River, the analysis helps to assess habitat alterations likely to be caused by a planned diversion to feed a nearby lake. In both instances, with a minimum requirement of field data, this method shows its flexibility and seems better able to detect critical situations than the conventional IFIM approach.

J	Vincent, D; Luczak, C; Sautour, B				Vincent, D; Luczak, C; Sautour, B			Effects of a brief climatic event on zooplankton community structure and distribution in Arcachon Bay (France)	JOURNAL OF THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM												Short-term changes in zooplankton community structure and distribution in relation to changes in hydrological features were studied during summer in two distinct areas of Arcachon Bay (France) from July to September 1986. One sampling site was chosen in the northern part of the bay, influenced by oceanic inputs, and the other one in the south-eastern part of the bay, close to an estuarine zone, influenced by the River Leyre's inputs. Three different zooplankton assemblages were identified according to a temperature-salinity gradient: (i) an estuarine assemblage dominated by Acartia bifilosa and Acartia tonsa; (ii) an autochthonous assemblage composed of Acartia discaudata; and (iii) a coastal neritic one composed of Paracalanus parvus, Oncaea venusta and Penilia avirostris. All these latter assemblages remained stable during most part of the study period. However, a brief climatic event (storm event) occurred in mid-August and gave rise to a sharp decrease in temperatures along with significant changes in zooplankton structure and distributions in the bay. The estuarine community vanished and was replaced by the autochthonous community. In the northern part of the bay, the coastal neritic community succeeded the previously observed autochthonous community. The effect of this brief climatic event was durable since recovery time lasted two weeks with regard to hydrological features and zooplankton communities. In addition, the climatic event also had ecological consequences since it permitted spreading of planktonic organisms from small-localized areas throughout the bay.					; Vincent, Dorothee/I-8109-2013	VINCENT, Dorothee/0000-0003-0931-3014; 													0025-3154					FEB	2002	82	1					21	30		10.1017/S0025315402005143	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0025315402005143													WOS:000174475600003
J	Isler, H; Hasenfratz, H; ONeill, T				Isler, H; Hasenfratz, H; ONeill, T			A sixth-century Irish headache cure and its use in a South German monastery	CEPHALALGIA												Medieval headache treatment is largely unknown. Medieval incantations against headache enumerate bodily organs to be protected. One 8th-century Latin hymn from Lake Constance using this device is addressed to Sr. Aid ''mechprech'', who has been identified as Aed Mac Bricc, Bishop of Killare, 6th century. This Irish Saint inspired unusual legends by some rather unorthodox activities: He abducted a young girl as hostage while his inheritance was withheld, but at the same time was seen surrounded by angels. He prayed for a nun who was pregnant and made the pregnancy vanish by a miracle, and he replaced the severed heads of maids, men and horses, creating a new spring as a by-product of this operation. Already at his birth his head had hit a stone, leaving a hole in the stone which collected rainwater that cured all ailments. In our own time, such ''bullaun stones'' are still believed to cure headache in ireland, According to the legends collected by Plummer and Colgan, St. Aed Mac Bricc was well known for his power to cure headaches. He relieved St. Brigid's headache when she was suffering many miles away, but his most impressive cure was in convincing a headache sufferer that the patient's headache could actually be transferred to his own head. The headache hymn or incantation is intended to repeat Aed's unique miracle.																			0333-1024					DEC	1996	16	8					536	540		10.1046/j.1468-2982.1996.1608536.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1468-2982.1996.1608536.x								8980854					WOS:A1996VZ93400004

The sedimentary processes responsible for formation of beach ridges on the north shore of Huangqihai Lake were investigated by using ground penetrating radar (GPR). A 400 MHz GPR antenna was used to achieve a high vertical resolution of 0.04-0.08 m. The radar stratigraphy was then determined using principles of seismic stratigraphy. The radar facies (RF) were determined by analyzing internal configuration and continuity of reflections, as well as reflection termination patterns. The identified RF fall into three groups (inclined, horizontal and irregular). The inclined group consists of RF that display inclined reflections. The horizontal group consists of RF that exhibit predominantly horizontal reflections. In the irregular group, the reflections are typically weak. RF with reflections with gently landward dips in the shore-normal profile are interpreted as washover sheet deposits. RF with steeply landward-dipping and imbricated reflections are interpreted as washover lobes. Washover sheets develop when overwash fails to enter a significant body of water and sedimentation takes place entirely on the relatively flattened topography. Washover lobe development occurs when overwash enters a region in which topography dips steeply landward, and sedimentation takes place on the surface of washover sheets or previous washover lobes. The beach-ridge deposits are interpreted as being formed entirely from vertically and laterally stacked washover sheets and washover lobes. They were formed by wave-dominated processes and secondary overwash processes supplemented by longshore currents.

J	Roubeix, V; Chalié, F; Gasse, F				Roubeix, Vincent; Chalie, Francoise; Gasse, Francoise			The diatom Thalassiosira faurii (Gasse) Hasle in the Ziway-Shala lakes (Ethiopia) and implications for paleoclimatic reconstructions: Case study of the Glacial-Holocene transition in East Africa	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The species Thalassiosira faurii (Gasse) Hasle was found dominating the planktonic diatom community during summer 2012 in Lake Langano which is part of the Ziway-Shala alkaline lake system in Ethiopia. In a previous study, the species had been recorded in high abundance in 13.5-12 cal ka old sediments from the neighbor Lake Abiyata. Using a transfer function for conductivity, peaks in abundance had been interpreted as dry spells at the Pleistocene-Holocene transition since the species was considered strictly halophilous. In this study, a strain of Thalassiosira faurii was isolated from Lake Langano and grown in the laboratory. The observation of its morphology and reproduction, and comparison between modem and fossil populations helped to improve the taxonomic definition of the species. The autecology of the species was also investigated through a salinity tolerance test. The results revealed that the species was much more sensitive to salinity than previously believed. Anew conductivity optimum was derived from the experiment and incorporated into the transfer function. The reassessment of lake conductivity variations along the core of Lake Abiyata showed that the intensity of the dry periods preceding the onset of the Holocene had been probably over-estimated. The reconsideration of the species relationship to conductivity may have important consequences for paleoclimatic reconstructions in tropical Africa where Thalassiosira faurii has been reported in abundance. The use of experimentation on local diatom strains allows paleoecologists to solve the problems of low representation of some species in modem dataset and of regional autecological variability within morphotypes.

J	Zhang, GQ; Xie, HJ; Duan, SQ; Tian, MZ; Yi, DH				Zhang, Guoqing; Xie, Hongjie; Duan, Shuiqiang; Tian, Mingzhong; Yi, Donghui			Water level variation of Lake Qinghai from satellite and in situ measurements under climate change	JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING												Lake level elevation and variation are important indicators of regional and global climate and environmental change. Lake Qinghai, the largest saline lake in China, located in the joint area of the East Asian monsoon, Indian summer monsoon, and Westerly jet stream, is particularly sensitive to climate change. This study examines the lake's water level and temporal change using the ice, cloud, and land elevation satellite (ICESat) altimetry data and gauge measurements. Results show that the mean water level from ICESat rose 0.67 m from 2003 to 2009 with an increase rate of 0.11 m/yr and that the ICESat data correlates well (r(2) = 0.90, root mean square difference 0.08 m) with gauge measurements. Envisat altimetry data show a similar change rate of 0.10 m/yr, but with similar to 0.52 m higher, primarily due to different referencing systems. Detailed examination of three sets of crossover ICESat tracks reveals that the lake level increase from 2004 to 2006 was 3 times that from 2006 to 2008, with the largest water level increase of 0.58 m from Feb. 2005 to Feb. 2006. Combined analyses with in situ precipitation, evaporation, and runoff measurements from 1956 to 2009 show that an overall decreasing trend of lake level (-0.07 m/yr) correlated with an overall increasing trend (+ 0.03 degrees C/yr) of temperature, with three major interannual peaks of lake level increases. The longest period of lake level increase from 2004 to 2009 could partly be due to accelerated glacier/perennial snow cover melt in the region during recent decades. Future missions of ICESat type, with possible increased repeatability, would be an invaluable asset for continuously monitoring lake level and change worldwide, besides its primary applications to polar regions.

J	Kelly, S; de Eyto, E; Dillane, M; Poole, R; White, M				Kelly, Sean; de Eyto, Elvira; Dillane, Mary; Poole, Russell; White, Martin			Characterizing ventilation events in an anoxic coastal basin: Observed dynamics and the role of climatic drivers	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Restricted horizontal exchange and vertical stratification restrict ventilation of bottom waters in many coastal systems, leading to stagnant basin water conditions. Dense inflows from oceanic sources can lead to dramatic changes in basin-scale properties over very short timescales. Here, we used a semi-enclosed coastal basin with deep-anoxia (Lough Furnace) as a test bed, in order to discern estuary-ocean exchange dynamics that lead to irregular and ephemeral deep-water ventilations. Measured densities and current profiler-based estimates of volume fluxes were used to compute typical renewal times of individual water masses in the stratified inner basin. Renewal timescales were primarily determined by freshwater flux and the spring-neap tidal cycle. The deployment period culminated with observations of a ventilation of the basin water which had been stagnant for over 2.5 yr. Entrainment of ambient resident water doubled the volume of the dense plume and diluted its oxygen content. Following ventilation, the volumetric extent of anoxia expanded by 20% within several months, owing to uplifting of old basin water and oxygen consumption in the new basin water. Founded on these observations, a predictive model was constructed relying only on freshwater, atmospheric pressure, and wind data and successfully recreated ventilation events over the past decade. Hindcasting the model back multiple decades implied contrasting periods of higher and lower frequency variability in ventilation occurrence. This model offers a diagnostic tool for assessing how climatic change may influence the oxygen climate in systems that experience contrasting regimes of suboxia and ventilation.

J	DAVIDOFF, EB				DAVIDOFF, EB			POPULATION-DYNAMICS OF THE CYPRINID MIROGREX-TERRAESANCTAE-TERRAESANCTAE (STEINITZ, 1952) IN LAKE KINNERET, ISRAEL	BAMIDGEH												The maximum catch of lavnum, M. t. terraesanctae (Steinitz, 1952), was 1313 tons, when good year-classes were present. Catches cannot be increased beyond this on a maximum sustained yield basis under present fishing regulations. The survival rate in the fishery last winter was too low, 8-21%. Only 2 main year-classes in the catch are indicated. Too many fish 100-135 mm are caught before they have the chance to spawn at least once. To enable larger numbers of fish to spawn, and to increase the average size of fish in the catch and increase survival rate, the Department of Fisheries is considering increasing the minimum legal length of lavnun from 120-130 mm. This measure should increase the stock by protecting 1-yr-old lavnun and allow them to spawn at least once before capture. This measure should aid in increasing the number of year-classes present in the catch and help stabilize the catch. When this measure goes into effect, the total catch will drop by .apprx. 46% for 1-2 yr while fish grow to the new legal size. Quotas will have to be set. A decision must be made as to how many fishermen will share the quota. Fishing intensity cannot be increased, therefore no new fishing licenses should be issued. Increasing the minimum size of lavnun in the catch is a worthwhile management measure.																			0005-4577						1982	34	4					130	139																WOS:A1982PX42400002

Four species, Chloromyxum dubium Auerbach, 1908, C. esocinum Dogiel, 1934, Sphaerospora cristata Shulman, 1962 (all Protozoa), and Crepidostomum metoecus Braun, 1900 (Digenea) are reported for the 1st time from North America. Aspects of the systematics and distribution of several species are discussed and the following new synonymies recognized: Tetraonchus rauschi Mizelle and Webb, 1953 with T. borealis (Olsson, 1893) (Monogenea); Cystidicola stigmatura (Leidy, 1886) with C. farionis Fischer, 1798; and Raphidascaris canadensis Smedley, 1933 with R. acus (Bloch, 1779) (both Nematoda). Substantial differences in the parasite fauna of Aishihik and Stevens lakes are noted; the possible consequences of the introduction of species of potential economic and pathogenic importance, e.g., Henneguya zschokkei (Gurley, 1893), Hexamita salmonis (Moore, 1923) (both Protozoa), Discocotyle sagittata (Leuckart, 1842) (Monogenea), Neoechinorhynchus rutili (O.

The ages of the ruptures are constrained by 111 radiocarbon dates, 97 of which fall in stratigraphic order. The average recurrence interval for all ruptures for this period is about 185 +/- A 105 years, although some ruptures, such as occurred in the April 1918 earthquake, caused only minor displacement. We rate the expression of each interpreted event in each of the twelve developed field exposures presented in this work by assigning numeric values for the presence of different criteria that indicate rupture to a paleo-ground surface. Weakly expressed ruptures, for example the deformation we interpret to be the result of the historical 1918 earthquake, received low scores and are interpreted as smaller earthquakes. From this analysis, we infer that at least fifteen of the identified ruptures are indicative of large earthquakes similar to the penultimate earthquake, inferred to be the M (w) 7.3 22 November 1800 earthquake. The adjusted recurrence interval for large earthquakes lengthens to approximately 254 years. Comparison with the rupture history at the Mystic Lake paleoseismic site on the Claremont strand indicates that it is plausible that several of the large ruptures identified at Hog Lake could have jumped the Hemet step-over at Mystic Lake and continued on the Claremont strand (or vice versa), but most of the event ages do not match between the two sites, indicating that most ruptures do not jump the step. Finally, comparison with San Andreas Fault ruptures both to the north and south of its juncture with the SJF suggest that some northern SJF ruptures identified at Mystic Lake may correlate with events identified at Wrightwood, but that these northern ruptures have no match at Hog Lake and can not indicate rupture of the entire SJF onto the SAF.					; Rockwell, Thomas/NEU-5799-2025	Rockwell, Thomas/0000-0001-5319-6447; 													0033-4553	1420-9136				MAY	2015	172	5			SI		1143	1165		10.1007/s00024-014-0955-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00024-014-0955-z													WOS:000352214000007

Ponds are recognized as important ecosystems supporting large numbers of species and several rare and threatened aquatic plants, macroinvertebrates and amphibians. Notwithstanding ponds, particularly temporary ones, are still neglected in Italy. There are some gaps in our understanding of the macrophyte ecology and the conservation value of Mediterranean small still waters. Therefore, this study investigated the macrophyte communities and physico-chemical characteristics of 8 permanent and 13 temporary ponds along the Tyrrhenian coast near Rome, with the aim to relate the distribution of aquatic plants to environmental variables, and to define the botanical conservation value of ponds. Throughout the study period (Spring 2002), Principal Component Analysis performed on abiotic variables clearly discriminated temporary ponds, smaller and more eutrophic, from permanent ponds, larger and with higher pH and oxygen concentration. A total of 73 macrophyte taxa were collected in the study ponds. Temporary waters hosted a smaller number of plant species than permanent ones. Besides hydroperiod length, the environmental factors related to plant richness were maximum depth, surface area, dissolved oxygen and nitrogen concentration in the water. Moreover, the Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling showed a high dissimilarity in the taxonomic composition of aquatic plants between temporary and permanent ponds. The former contained more annual fast-growing species (Callitriche sp. pl. and Ranunculus sp. pl.), while in the latter species with long life-cycles (i.e. Potamogeton sp. pl.) were more abundant. Our results highlighted that temporary and permanent ponds in central Italy have different macrophyte assemblages, with aquatic species (including some of conservation interest at regional scale) exclusively found in each pond type. This suggested that both type of ponds could give an irreplaceable contribution to the conservation of aquatic plant diversity of these freshwater ecosystems.

J	Persson, A; Svensson, JM				Persson, Anders; Svensson, Jonas M.			Effects of benthivorous fish on biogeochemical processes in lake sediments	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Studies of aquatic environments have shown that community organisation may strongly affect ecosystem functioning. One common phenomenon is a change in nutrient level following a shift in the fish community composition. Although several hypotheses have been suggested, there is no consensus on which mechanisms are involved. Our study evaluated indirect effects of benthivorous fish on the biogeochemical processes at the sediment-water interface separately from direct effects caused by nutrient excretion or sediment resuspension. 2. We assigned field enclosures to three treatments representing typical pond communities; without fish, addition of approximately 10 small tench or addition of one large bream. After one summer, we monitored the water chemistry, benthic invertebrates and periphyton in the enclosures and sampled sediment cores for laboratory analysis of biochemical process rates (oxygen, phosphorus and nitrogen exchange between sediment and water, and denitrification rate). 3. Fish had strong negative effects on benthic invertebrates, but weaker effects on periphyton, organic content and porosity of the sediment. Moreover, there were significant positive fish effects on both phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations in the water. However, there were no general treatment effects on sediment processes that could explain the treatment effects on water chemistry in the enclosures. 4. Hence, overall treatment effects attenuated along the chain of interactions. We conclude that the observed effect of benthic fish on water chemistry was probably because of direct effects on nutrient excretion or resuspension of sediment. The similarity between bream and tench treatments suggests large niche complementarity despite their different habitat preferences.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				JUL	2006	51	7					1298	1309		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2006.01569.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2006.01569.x													WOS:000238185600009

The environmental and evolutionary history of Lake Ohrid (FYROM/Albania): interim results from the SCOPSCO deep drilling project	BIOGEOSCIENCES												This study reviews and synthesises existing information generated within the SCOPSCO (Scientific Collaboration on Past Speciation Conditions in Lake Ohrid) deep drilling project. The four main aims of the project are to infer (i) the age and origin of Lake Ohrid (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia/Republic of Albania), (ii) its regional seismotectonic history, (iii) volcanic activity and climate change in the central northern Mediterranean region, and (iv) the influence of major geological events on the evolution of its endemic species. The Ohrid basin formed by transtension during the Miocene, opened during the Pliocene and Pleistocene, and the lake established de novo in the still relatively narrow valley between 1.9 and 1.3 Ma. The lake history is recorded in a 584m long sediment sequence, which was recovered within the framework of the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP) from the central part (DEEP site) of the lake in spring 2013. To date, 54 tephra and cryptotephra horizons have been found in the upper 460m of this sequence. Tephrochronology and tuning biogeochemical proxy data to orbital parameters revealed that the upper 247.8m represent the last 637 kyr. The multi- proxy data set covering these 637 kyr indicates long-term variability. Some proxies show a change from generally cooler and wetter to drier and warmer glacial and interglacial periods around 300 ka. Short-term environmental change caused, for example, by tephra deposition or the climatic impact of millennial-scale Dansgaard-Oeschger and Heinrich events are superimposed on the long-term trends. Evolutionary studies on the extant fauna indicate that Lake Ohrid was not a refugial area for regional freshwater animals. This differs from the surrounding catchment, where the mountainous setting with relatively high water availability provided a refuge for temperate and montane trees during the relatively cold and dry glacial periods. Although Lake Ohrid experienced significant environmental change over the last 637 kyr, preliminary molecular data from extant microgastropod species do not indicate significant changes in diversification rate during this period. The reasons for this constant rate remain largely unknown, but a possible lack of environmentally induced extinction events in Lake Ohrid and/or the high resilience of the ecosystems may have played a role.

J	Hoyer, MV; Frazer, TK; Notestein, SK; Canfield, DE				Hoyer, MV; Frazer, TK; Notestein, SK; Canfield, DE			Vegetative characteristics of three low-lying Florida coastal rivers in relation to flow, light, salinity and nutrients	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The Chassahowitzka, Homosassa and Crystal rivers along the central Gulf coast of Florida were studied from 1998 to 2000 to identify factors controlling the abundance and distribution of submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV). Each of these three low-lying coastal rivers are spring-fed and exhibit low to moderate absolute flow rates (flows in either direction because of tidal influences, 0.06-0.46 m s(-1)) with only 14% of the stations sampled for SAV having flow rates in excess of 0.25 m s(-1). At those stations where flow rates exceeded 0.25 m s(-1), the substrate was generally comprised of exposed limestone outcroppings and did not provide a favorable habitat for either submersed macrophytes or macroalgae. The remaining sampling stations, where flow rates were less than 0.25 m s(-1), had suitable substrates (e.g. mud, mud/sand, and sand) for the colonization and subsequent growth of SAV. Light availability and salinity were determined to be major factors affecting the distribution and abundance of SAV. Sampling stations, where the percent of incident light at the surface reaching the substrate was less than 10%, had little or no SAV biomass. Low SAV biomass was also linked to sites where annual average salinities exceeded 3.5parts per thousand. Nutrient loads and nutrient concentrations accounted for little variance in SAV biomass after accounting for flow and related substrate type, light and salinity. These latter factors control the distribution and abundance of SAV in these three Florida coastal rivers.																			0018-8158					OCT	2004	528	1-3					31	43		10.1007/s10750-004-1658-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-004-1658-8													WOS:000224723600003

Widespread long-term declines of littoral areas in protected and unprotected Czech fishponds	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Fishponds play a key role in current pondscapes in many developed countries. They provide multiple ecosystem services affected by trade-offs mediated by different types of fishpond management. Many fishponds were impacted by the shift towards more intensive aquaculture and widespread eutrophication in the 20th century. These changes can undermine various ecosystem functions including the maintenance of aquatic and riparian biodiversity in the littoral areas, but their extent is not well documented. Here we use aerial photographs to investigate the changes of littoral areas of 46 protected and 20 unprotected fishponds in the Czech Republic between the years 1950 and 2019. Protected fishponds had initially larger littoral areas than the unprotected ones, and the difference persisted over time. However, littoral areas decreased markedly in 38 protected (mean area decrease by 22.5%) and all unprotected (mean area decrease by 16%) fishpond categories, especially during the second half of the 20th century. Within protected fishponds, the trend was unaffected by the reserve establishment year, fishpond area and conservation target. Our results suggests that legal protection did not prevent the initial catastrophic loss of littoral areas and facilitated at most minor recovery in the last two de-cades, with negative implications for long-term maintenance of aquatic diversity. We attribute the losses of fishpond littoral areas to high fish stocks and eutrophication resulting from additional feeding, pond manuring, and ongoing nutrient inputs from the pond catchments. We conclude that littoral areas of fishponds urgently need effective protection. This would require a paradigm shift towards less intensive fish stock management, more frequent summer drainage, and effective reduction of all nutrient inputs to increase the water quality. Such measures could help recover the littoral areas and the associated biota.

Evaluating different additive levels of yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, on the growth and production performances of a hybrid of two populations of Egyptian African catfish, Clarias gariepinus	AQUACULTURE												A breeding and feeding experiment was undertaken to study the performances of the hybrid of two Egyptian populations of African catfish Clarias gariepinus, El-Manzalah catfish (MCF) characterized by the tolerance against poor water quality and the ease to be farmed in captivity and El-Qanater catfish (QCF) characterized by rapid growth and high quality flesh. Crosses of these two populations (MCF female x QCF male) were carried out in El-Gamalia hatchery, El-Manzalah, Egypt, during spring. When the mean body weight of African catfish hybrid fingerlings has reached 24.34 +/- 1.38 g (mean +/- SD) they were transferred to cages (112 m(3)) with a stocking density of 50 fish/m(3) suspended in lake El-Manzalah. Fish were fed a formulated diet containing approximately 31% (analyzed value) crude protein and cultured for 214 days. Four levels of dried brewer's yeast. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, (DY) were used as feed additives at levels of 0.0, 1.0,1.5 and 2.0% in diets. Results showed that, adding high level of DY, 2%, recorded highest final body weight (913.26 g), growth rate (4.72 g/fish/day), total production (47.5 kg/m(3)) and profit per cage (5221%) after 186 days. The study demonstrates that DY inclusion in the feeds of hybrid cat fish was significant However, finding the optimal inclusion level of DY still needs more investigation of higher DY levels than 2%. The overall data of the present study has confirmed that catfish hybrid showed better parameters than the parents in respect of growth rate, survival percentage and feed efficiency. Moreover, hybrid catfish had a significantly highest production, 47.5 kg/m(3). (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

J	Scheid, D; Stubner, S				Scheid, D; Stubner, S			Structure and diversity of Gram-negative sulfate-reducing bacteria on rice roots	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												Specific PCR assays were used to amplify the 16S rRNA genes of the Desulfobacteriaceae and the Desulfovibrionaceae from extracted environmental DNA from rice roots. 16S rDNA-based community patterns of the Desulfobacteriaceae were generated via terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis from rice roots and compared with bulk soil. The molecular fingerprints showed no significant difference between rice roots and bulk soil. but changes during the vegetation period. 16S rDNA clone libraries and sequencing showed that the predominant terminal restriction fragments represented distinct phylogenetic groups. The 16S rDNA clone sequences of the Desulfobacteriaceae fell in the phylogenetic radiation of Desulfonema and Desulfosarcina or grouped within the Desulfohabdus-Syntrophobacter assemblage. Three of the latter sequences were closely affiliated with the MPN isolate EZ-2C2 from rice roots. All Desulfovibrionaceae 16S rDNA clone sequences, with one exception. were affiliated with the MPN isolate FI-7b from rice roots. The clustering of the clone sequences and the close phylogenetic affiliation with isolates from MPN enrichments from the same habitat in two cases indicated that these sequence clusters may represent predominant Gram-negative sulfate reducers on rice roots. Quantification of the bacterial abundances was accomplished by rRNA dot blot hybridization. In total the Gram-negative sulfate reducers accounted for approximately 2-3% of the total rRNA content. The relative rRNA abundance of the Desulfobacteriaceae was, at 1.4%, higher than that of the Desulfovibrionaceae crf (0.5%). (C) 2001 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

Gary			Effects of temperature and food availability on liver fatty acid composition and plasma cortisol concentration in age-0 lake sturgeon: Support for homeoviscous adaptation	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY A-MOLECULAR & INTEGRATIVE PHYSIOLOGY												Overwintering survival in north temperate fishes involves a series of adaptive responses to multiple environmental stressors. Homeoviscous adaptation includes changes in membrane lipid composition in response to reduced environmental temperature, which may be driven by changes in hormones involved in the endocrine stress response. We examined how reduced temperature and food availability may act in concert to influence hepatic fatty acid composition of phospholipids and triglycerides, in addition to plasma concentration of cortisol in age-0 lake sturgeon (A. fulvescens). At 153 days post hatch (dph), temperature was decreased from 16 degrees C to 1 degrees C at a rate of 0.5 degrees C per day, and at 200 dph, fish were either fed every other day or deprived of food for 45 days to simulate an overwintering event. Liver fatty acid composition of phospholipids and triglycerides were assessed before temperature manipulation (16 degrees C; 153 dph), when fish had been at 1 degrees C for 16 days (199 dph), 25 days of overwintering (225 dph) and 45 days of overwintering (245 dph). Plasma cortisol concentration was assessed at 153, 225 and 245 dph. When temperature was decreased, both mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids significantly increased in phospholipids and triglycerides. Total omega-6 fatty acids significantly increased in phospholipids while total omega-3 fatty acids did not. During the simulated overwintering, there was no obvious difference in fatty acids of phospholipids and triglycerides between diet treatments and no difference in circulating cortisol concentration between baseline and post-stressed fish in the fasted group. Our results provide support for homeoviscous adaptation to cold temperatures in lake sturgeon.					; Yoon, Gwangseok/AAH-4714-2021	Yoon, Gwangseok/0000-0001-5557-8692; 													1095-6433	1531-4332				NOV	2021	261								111056	10.1016/j.cbpa.2021.111056	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpa.2021.111056		AUG 2021						34418543					WOS:000692941800010
J	Dekker, W				Dekker, W			What caused the decline of the Lake IJsselmeer eel stock after 1960?	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												The European eel (Anguilla anguilla L.) is in severe decline: landings from and recruitment to the stock have fallen off since the mid-1960s and the early 1980s, respectively. Several hypotheses on the causes of the decline in recruitment have been advanced, some predicting an earlier decline of the adult stock. In order to narrow the range of potential hypotheses, this paper contrasts current ones with trends in abundance and length distribution of the local stock in Lake IJsselmeer (the Netherlands) over the period of the decline. The data set consists of research surveys, market sampling, gear development experiments, etc., since 1904, and is uninterrupted since 1950. A statistical analysis is designed in which sampling characteristics (length selectivity of gears and of mesh sizes, and sample selection procedures) are separated out of trends in the local stock over the years (abundance, length composition). The decline of the Lake IJsselmeer stock started in 1960, affected exploited and undersized eels, and was steeper for larger eels. The abundance of the smallest size class in the lake matches the independently recorded recruitment strength, which did not decline before 1980. Excessive exploitation, habitat loss, barriers to migration, introduced parasites, and changes in ocean climate cannot explain the observed trends when taken individually. Therefore, the cause of the decline of the local stock in Lake IJsselmeer is still a mystery and, because the historical information is limited and cannot be added to, is likely to remain so.

J	Reynolds, JA; Hand, SC				Reynolds, JA; Hand, SC			Differences in isolated mitochondria are insufficient to account for respiratory depression during diapause in Artemia franciscana embryos	PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL ZOOLOGY												In response to cues signifying the approach of winter, adult Artemia franciscana produce encysted embryos that enter diapause. We show that respiration rates of diapause embryos collected from the field ( Great Salt Lake, Utah) are reduced up to 92% compared with postdiapause embryos when measured under conditions of normoxia and full hydration. However, mitochondria isolated from diapause embryos exhibit rates of state 3 and state 4 respiration on pyruvate that are equivalent to those from postdiapause embryos with active metabolism; a reduction in these rates (15% - 27%) is measured with succinate for two of three collection years. Respiratory control ratios for diapause mitochondria are comparable to or higher than those from postdiapause embryos. The P : O flux ratios are statistically identical. Our calculations suggest that respiration of intact, postdiapause embryos is operating close to the state 3 oxygen fluxes measured for isolated mitochondria. Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity is 53% lower in diapause mitochondria during one collection year; the minimal impact of this COX reduction on mitochondrial respiration appears to be due to the 31% excess COX capacity in A. franciscana mitochondria. Transmission electron micrographs of embryos reveal mitochondria that are well differentiated and structurally similar in both states. As inferred from the similar amounts of mitochondrial protein extractable, tissue contents of mitochondria in diapause and postdiapause embryos are equivalent. Thus, metabolic depression during diapause cannot be fully explained by altered properties of isolated mitochondria. Rather, mechanisms for active inhibition or substrate limitation of mitochondrial metabolism in vivo may be operative.

J	Koski-Vähälä, J; Hartikainen, H				Koski-Vähälä, J; Hartikainen, H			Assessment of the risk of phosphorus loading due to resuspended sediment	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Resuspension is a multiphase phenomenon where suspended solids encounter water layers differing in physico-chemical properties that affect the reactions of phosphorus (P). The role of resuspended sediment as a sink or source of dissolved P was determined in a laboratory study of P desorption-sorption equilibria. Gradual mixing was simulated using decreasing solid concentrations and varying environmental conditions (pH, redox, ionic strength). To describe the P exchange when the particles encounter dissimilar water layers, the extent of P sorption to or desorption from solids was expressed as a function of P concentration in the bath solutions. The equilibrium phosphorus concentration (EPC), at which there is no net P release from or retention to the particles, proved to be a suitable parameter for assessment of P load risk. Under oxic conditions at pH 7, commonly prevailing in lakes, the EPC values ranged from 11 to 27 mug P L-1. The larger the water volume the suspended material was mixed with, the higher the P concentration, allowing desorption to occur. As for chemical factors affecting P mobilization, EPC followed the order: pH 7 < pH 7 anoxic < pH 9. A separate extraction experiment revealed that elevated pH enhanced P mobilization more as the concentration of solids decresed. The results demonstrate that high pH (a common characteristic in eutrophic lakes during summer), when linked with intensive resuspension, may markedly increase the internal P loading risk. As for the risk assessment, the quantification of the internal P loading would be improved by isotherm studies combined with field observations.																			0047-2425					MAY-JUN	2001	30	3					960	966		10.2134/jeq2001.303960x	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2001.303960x								11401287					WOS:000169455600030

Discussion and conclusions	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												A 12.4 m core taken in Lake Bangong provides a continuous Holocene climatic record. We summarize information on changes in stable isotope and radiocarbon balances in the lake, hydrobiology and vegetal cover in the catchment, deduced from detailed analytical results given in the three preceding papers. The Bangong record is then compared with the environmental history of the neighbouring Lake Sumxi also constructed from multidisciplinary analyses. The two records show a major environmental change at approximate to 10-9.5 ka B.P., attributed to a rapid strengthening of the summer monsoonal circulation which led to wet-warm conditions. This event was followed by a long-term trend toward aridity which culminated around 4-3 ka B.P.. In Western Tibet, maximum monsoon rainfall seems to have occurred from approximate to 9.5 to 8.7 ka B.P, and from approximate to 7.2 to 6.3 ka B.P., as two wet pulses separated by a reversal event centered on 8.0-7.7 ka B.P. Our results broadly agree with the records from Lake Seling in Central Tibet, and Lake Qinghai at the plateau's northeastern margin, and with palaeoclimatic studies in western China which document conditions wetter and warmer than those of today during the early-middle Holocene. The environmental fluctuations recorded in western Tibet appear in phase with climatic changes recognized in tropical North Africa, suggesting that the 8.0-7.7 ka B.P. and the 4.0-3.0 ka B.P. dry events were caused by abrupt disequilibrium in the climatic system.																			0031-0182					FEB	1996	120	1-2					79	92		10.1016/0031-0182(95)00035-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0031-0182(95)00035-6													WOS:A1996UA85400006

Near-infrared spectra of liquid/solid acetylene under Titan relevant conditions and implications for Cassini/VIMS detections	ICARUS												Acetylene is thought to be abundant on Titan according to most photochemical models. While detected in the atmosphere, its likely presence at the surface still lacks physical evidence. It is thought that solid acetylene could be a major component of Titan's lakes shorelines and dry lakebed, detected as the 5 mu m-bright deposits with the Cassini/VIMS instrument. Acetylene could also be present under its liquid form as dissolved solids in Titan's methane-ethane lakes, as emphasized by thermodynamics studies. This paper is devoted to the near-infrared spectroscopy study of acetylene under solid and liquid phases between 1 and 2.2 mu m, synthesized in a Titan simulation chamber that is able to reproduce extreme temperature conditions. From experiments, we observed a similar to 10% albedo increase between liquid acetylene at 193-188 K and solid acetylene at 93 K. Using the NIR spectroscopy technique we successfully calculated the reflectivity ratio of solid/liquid acetylene as 1.13. The second difference we observed between liquid and solid acetylene is a shift in the major absorption band detected at 1.54 mu m, the shift of similar to 0.01 mu m occurring toward higher wavelength. In order to assess the detectability of acetylene on Titan using the Cassini/VIMS instrument, we adapted our spectra to the VIMS spectral resolution. The spectral band at 1.55 mu m and a negative slope at 2.0 mu m falls in the Cassini/VIMS atmospheric windows over several VIMS infrared spectels, thus Cassini/VIMS should be able to detect acetylene.

J	GARRETT, RG; BANVILLE, RMP; ADCOCK, SW				GARRETT, RG; BANVILLE, RMP; ADCOCK, SW			REGIONAL GEOCHEMICAL DATA COMPILATION AND MAP PREPARATION, LABRADOR, CANADA	JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION												Procedures used to compile geochemical data for some 20,000 lake sediment and stream sediment samples from 292,000 km2 in Labrador, Canada, are described. A methodology for integrating the lake and stream sediment data is developed which compensates for the varying organic component in the matrix of the two sample media. It is shown that this procedure is effective in reducing the variability of the Zn and Ni data due to the organic matrix effect and for normalizing the data for regional-scale comparisons. No compensation was required for U data. In order to generate geochemical maps of the broad-scale patterns in the data, reflecting such features as structural provinces, litho-tectonic packages and metallogenic provinces, the use of medians for the data falling within square cells with a side varying from 10 to 50 km was investigated. An Analysis of Variance procedure is described which was used to select an optimal cell size. For the Labrador data 25 x 25 km cells were selected, resulting in a 97% reduction in the volume of data to be managed. The reduced data contained approximately 35%, 70% and 55% of the information for Zn, Ni and U, respectively. The final maps appear to reflect major features of the regional geochemistry related to the geological history of Labrador. It is proposed that the procedures developed should be further evaluated to determine their suitability in fulfilling the objectives of IGCP Project 259 on International Geochemical Mapping.																			0375-6742					DEC	1990	39	1-2					91	116		10.1016/0375-6742(90)90070-Q	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0375-6742(90)90070-Q													WOS:A1990EX37600006
J	Ji, ZG; Jin, KR				Ji, Zhen-Gang; Jin, Kang-Ren			Gyres and seiches in a large and shallow lake	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Gyres and seiches are two prominent features of lakes. Gyres largely transport sediments, nutrients, and algae in the horizontal direction. Seiches, on the other hand, can contribute to the vertical mixing in lakes. Theoretical analysis, statistical methods, and numerical models are used to investigate gyres and seiches in Lake Okeechobee, the largest subtropical/tropical lake in North America. The lake has a 1,730-km(2) surface water area, a typical length of more than 50 kin, and a mean depth of 3.2 in. Both the Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) method and the numerical model results indicated that lake circulation is typically dominated by a two-gyre pattern, especially in the winter. The northwest wind or southeast wind leads to a cyclone (a counterclockwise rotation gyre) in the southwest and an anticyclone (a clockwise rotation gyre) in the northeast. Because the mean velocity field in the lake is very weak, the first two EOF modes play an important role in lake transport. The mechanism of gyre formation in the lake is clearly explained in a theoretical analysis. Power spectra analysis on measured and modeled water elevations at four stations revealed that Lake Okeechobee has a seiche signal of 5 hours or so. The seiche range is typically around 10 cm. Results from the theoretical analysis, power spectral analysis, and numerical modeling all agree with each other very well. The findings in this study should be useful to understand the lake processes, to guide field data collection programs, and to assist decision making on lake management.																			0380-1330						2006	32	4					764	775		10.3394/0380-1330(2006)32[764:GASIAL]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3394/0380-1330(2006)32[764:GASIAL]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000243172100009

Its biodiversity is still not fully known and some taxa are particularly challenging to identify. DNA barcoding became a common method for the identification of such taxa and has become a crucial tool in biomonitoring and biodiversity studies. Accurate species identification through barcoding relies on curated reference libraries. Water mites are a species-rich group of ecologically important and widely distributed aquatic invertebrates for which little DNA barcoding data is available. Our study aims to develop the first reference library of COI barcodes for water mites from the ancient Lake Ohrid and surrounding springs, followed by analysis of their molecular diversity. Such libraries are well-developed for many waterbodies in Europe (e.g. Alpine Lakes), but are heavily underrepresented for the Mediterranean Region and completely absent for Lake Ohrid. We provide 327 COI barcodes clustered into 34 BINs (molecular equivalents of species) of which 6 are endemic. We identified 33 species, of which 20 are new for the Ohrid basin. We also identified several cases of intraspecific diversity suggesting morphologically cryptic species or previous misidentifications, suggesting that DNA barcoding is invaluable in the taxonomic identification of water mites. We discovered a relatively low turnover of species with neighbouring Lake Skadar, which may be a result of differences in their physical and geographical characteristics. Our study represents a major advance for the future taxonomic, phylogeographic studies and biomonitoring using water mites as model taxon.

This movement is largely vertical and can be detected using differential synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry, There are three main components to this motion: (1) movement of surface scatterers, resulting in radar phase decorrelation, (2) measurable subsidence of the flow surface due to thermal contraction and clast repacking, and (3) time-dependent depression of the flow substrate. These effects act in proportion to the thickness of the lava flow and decay with time, although there is a time lag before the third component becomes significant. We explore these effects using SAR data from the ERS satellites over the Etna volcano, Sicily. Phase decorrelation on young, thick a'a lava flows persists for a few years and probably results from surface block rotations during flow contraction. Maximum measured subsidence rates of the 1991-1993 lava flow over a period of 70 days are about 0.7 mm day(-1), but are potentially greater in areas of data decorrelation. These rates fall to <2.7 x 10(-2) mm day(-1) after about 20 years in flows about 50 m thick, sooner for thinner flows. Comparison with measured subsidence rates on Kilauean lava lakes suggests that thermal contraction only accounts for about one third of the observed subsidence. The remaining motion is thought to come from surface clast repacking during cooling and from creep mechanisms in the flow substrate. Measurements of postemplacement surface movement provide new constraints on the thermomechanical properties of lava flows and have cautionary implications for the interpretation of interferometric SAR data of volcanoes.					; Williams, Charles/D-9377-2011; Muller, Jan-Peter/Q-8886-2019	Morley, Jeremy/0000-0002-3658-8796; Muller, Jan-Peter/0000-0002-5077-3736; Williams, Charles/0000-0001-7435-9196; 													2169-9313	2169-9356				JUN 10	2001	106	B6					11293	11313		10.1029/2000JB900425	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2000JB900425													WOS:000169160200023

Increases in bloom frequency or intensity and their earlier onset in spring were shown to be linked to multiple anthropogenic disturbances, including climate change. The aim of the present study was to describe the phenology of phytoplankton blooms and its potential link with morphological, physiographic, anthropogenic, and climatic characteristics of the lakes and their watershed. The spatiotemporal dynamics of near-surface blooms were studied on 580 lakes in southern Quebec (Eastern Canada) over a 17-year period by analyzing chlorophyll-a concentrations gathered from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite images. Results show a significant increase by 23% in bloom frequency across all studied lakes between 2000 and 2016. The first blooms of the year appeared increasingly early over this period but only by 3 days (median date changing from 6 June to 3 June). Results also indicate that high biomass values are often reached, but the problem is seldom extended to the entire lake surface. The canonical correlation analysis between phenological variables and environmental variables shows that higher frequency and intensity of phytoplankton blooms and earlier onset date occurred for smaller watersheds and higher degree-days, lake surface area, and proportion of urban zones. This study provides a regional picture of lake trophic state over a wide variety of lacustrine environments in Quebec, a detailed phenology allowing to go beyond local biomass assessments, and the first steps on the development of an approach exploiting regional trends for local pattern assessments.

J	Smith, JP				Smith, JP			Foraging flights and habitat use of nesting wading birds (Ciconiiformes) at Lake Okeechobee, Florida	COLONIAL WATERBIRDS												I monitored the foraging flights of four species of nesting adult wading birds at Lake Okeechobee, Florida, from 1989-1992 during chick-rearing periods. Median flight distances were: Great Egret (Casmerodius albus, N = 356) 3.7 km, range 0.1-33.3; Snowy Egret (Egretta thula, N = 236) 2.8 km, range 0.1-29.8; Tricolored Heron (E. tricolor, N = 82) 2.4 km, 0.1-22.3; and White Ibis (Eudocimus albus, N = 286) 2.7 km, range 0.1-33.3. Flights at the lake averaged moderate to short in comparison to those monitored in other areas of the southeastern United States. I found little evidence that increasing foraging flight distances influenced levels of nesting success and nestling production. Tricolored Herons were the possible exception; linear regressions of annual median flight distances versus colony-specific estimates of nest success and productivity revealed significant negative relationships. The association arose primarily because flights during two seasons averaged longer and success lower at one colony. Instead of foraging nearby in agricultural field ditches along with Snowy Egrets and Great Egrets, Tricolored Herons at this colony frequently traveled relatively long distances to forage in natural habitats within the diked boundaries of the lake. The dike that surrounds the lake produces an abrupt transition between natural habitats on the lake and diverse natural and artificial habitats off the lake. Tricolored Herons that nested on the lake generally foraged within the diked boundaries of the lake, but the dike's presence may help ensure that the other species nesting on the lake have access to diverse foraging opportunities under a wide range of hydrologic conditions. For all species, patterns of habitat use shifted significantly in response to fluctuations of the lake stage. There was evidence that high lake stages and rising water increased the flight distances of Snowy Egrets and perhaps Great Egrets, and that interruptions in otherwise steady surface-water trends (rising or falling levels) increased the flight distances of White Ibises. However, the variety of accessible habitats was such that nesting birds usually could adjust their patterns of habitat use in response to changing hydrologic conditions without having to extend their foraging distances to a degree sufficient to reduce levels of nesting success and productivity. Instead, variation in the quality of habitats accessible under different hydrologic conditions probably did contribute to observed variation in nest productivity.																			0738-6028						1995	18	2					139	158		10.2307/1521475	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1521475													WOS:A1995TN58800002

It is of great significance to study the land use change and its driving forces for the protection of rare waterfowl and the restoration of ecological environment. The study of land use changes and driving forces in Shengjin Lake wetland can provide reference for land use pattern optimization, the protection of rare waterfowl, and the restoration of ecological environment of Shengjin Lake wetland. Taking Shengjin Lake wetland as an example, based on nine remote sensing images of Shengjin Lake wetland from 1986 to 2019, the land use change process of Shengjin Lake wetland was analyzed by using geographic information technology. Meanwhile, driving factors of land use change were analyzed using mathematical statistics method. The following results were obtained: The areas of grassland, paddy fields, tidal land, and other land types increased from 1986 to 2019, whereas areas of woodland, dry land, water, and reed beach dropped. Land use composite index fluctuated slightly but was at a moderate level overall, indicating land use was in the period of development. The main driving forces of land use change in the study area included terrain topography, climate, population change, social-economic development, and policy factors. Each land use type had its own dominant driving factor. And changes of any type of land use were attributed to multiple driving factors instead of a single one. To summarize, the natural factor provides the intrinsic motivation for land use change, but population is the fundamental factor.

J	Sasaki, N; Sugai, T				Sasaki, Natsuki; Sugai, Toshihiko			Holocene development of mountain wetlands within and outside of landslide in the Hachimantai volcanic group, northeastern Japan	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												In warm and humid, tectonically active regions like Japan, landslides are an important influence on the development of mountain wetlands, but data bearing upon the relationship of Quaternary landslides to wetland development are scarce. We used lithological analysis, 14C dating, tephra age data, and carbon contents of wetland cores to compare the evolution of four wetlands, one (the Oyachi wetland) within a landslide area transformed by mass movement and three (the Appi Highland wetlands) outside of a landslide area, in the heavy snowfall region of the Hachimantai Mountains of northeastern Japan. Evidence from the Oyachi wetland shows that its transition from peatland to forest was interrupted at about 5500 cal BP by slope movement leading to the development of a lake that was drained by streams at about 3300 cal BP, after which a peatland environment has persisted until the present. We suggest that the evolution of this type of wetland is primarily influenced by landslide movements and stream dissection rather than climate change. In the Appi Highland wetlands, peatlands appeared much later, around the time of the To-a tephra fall in 915 AD, during the Medieval Warm Period, and have persisted with little change until the present. We suggest that the development of mountain wetlands outside of landslide areas is primarily related to climate changes rather than topographic changes. Sediment analyses of mountain wetlands within landslide areas may be useful for tracing the development of Quaternary landslides and subsequent topographic changes that may have implications for biodiversity in mountainous regions.

This contribution reviews how catalyst may influence reactions and several examples, mostly taken from the geochemical literature, are presented to illustrate the most important concepts. Two key characteristics that define a catalyst are activity and selectivity. Activity is the extent to which the catalyst can facilitate the rate of conversion of reactant to product. The selectivity of the catalyst refers to the ability of a catalyst to facilitate a specific reaction pathway where a reaction may proceed via multiple pathways. Photocatalysis is presented as a separate class of catalysis because reactions are only catalyzed when the system is illuminated with light of suitable wavelength. Three mechanisms of photocatalysis (photolysis, photoelectrochemical reaction, and charge injection) are discussed. Geocatalysis is particularly important for reactions with high activation energies, such as isotopic exchange reactions involving SO4-H2S, H2O-SO4, H2O-PO4, CO2-CH4 and transformations of humic acids and kerogen. While photocatalysis is limited to surficial aquatic environments, it may be of great importance in regulating the concentrations of redox-sensitive elements in the photic zones of lakes, streams, hot spring, and oceans. Photoelectrochemical reactions, such as the reduction of dinitrogen and carbon dioxide are thought to have been important in the origin of life on Earth. Geocatalysis may also prove to be useful in designing new environmental remediation technologies. For example, it is shown that sphalerite and ilmenite are capable of degrading chlorinated carbon compounds via a photocatalytic mechanism. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The cadmium content fell into the range from 0.00-5.50 mu g.dm(-3), on the average 0.83 mu g.dm(-3), and the lead content ranged from 0.00-18.10 mu g.dm(-3), on average 3.16 mu g.dm(-3). The chromium content ranged from 0.00-21.00 mu g.dm(-3), on average 4.26 mu g.dm(-3) and, finally, the content of nickel ranged from 0.00-39.80 mu g.dm(-3), on average 6.70 mu g.dm(-3). The values of the analysed heavy metals were similar to the concentrations noted in natural lakes and artificial water reservoirs. As far as the heavy metal content is concerned, the water from the selected Strzelin Quarry Lakes met the requirements that allow using it for the purposes of agricultural irrigation.					; Jawecki, Bartosz/S-8937-2016	Jawecki, Bartosz/0000-0002-4277-0412; 													2299-8993					MAR	2021	22	3					1	10		10.12911/22998993/132604	http://dx.doi.org/10.12911/22998993/132604													WOS:000637770900001
J	Masse-Dufresne, J; Barbecot, F; Baudron, P; Gibson, J				Masse-Dufresne, Janie; Barbecot, Florent; Baudron, Paul; Gibson, John			Quantifying floodwater impacts on a lake water budget via volume-dependent transient stable isotope mass balance	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Isotope mass balance models have undergone significant developments in the last decade, demonstrating their utility for assessing the spatial and temporal variability in hydrological processes and revealing significant value for baseline assessment in remote and/or flood-affected settings where direct measurement of surface water fluxes to lakes (i.e. stream gauging) are difficult to perform. In this study, we demonstrate that isotopic mass balance modelling can be used to provide evidence of the relative importance of direct floodwater inputs and temporary subsurface storage of floodwater at ungauged lake systems. A volume-dependent transient isotopic mass balance model was developed for an artificial lake (named lake A) in southern Quebec (Canada). This lake typically receives substantial floodwater inputs during the spring freshet period as an ephemeral hydraulic connection with a 150 000 km(2) large watershed is established. First-order water flux estimates to lake A allow for impacts of floodwater inputs to be highlighted within the annual water budget. The isotopic mass balance model has revealed that groundwater and surface water inputs account for 60 %-71% and 39 %-28% of the total annual water inputs to lake A, respectively, which demonstrates an inherent dependence of the lake on groundwater. However, when considering the potential temporary subsurface storage of floodwater, the partitioning between groundwater and surface water inputs tends to equalize, and the lake A water budget is found to be more resilient to groundwater quantity and quality changes. Our findings suggest not only that floodwater fluxes to lake A have an impact on its dynamics during springtime but also significantly influence its long-term water balance and help to inform, understand, and predict future water quality variations.

J	ANDERSON, JR; MORISON, AK; RAY, DJ				ANDERSON, JR; MORISON, AK; RAY, DJ			AGE AND GROWTH OF MURRAY COD, MACCULLOCHELLA-PEELII (PERCIFORMES, PERCICHTHYIDAE), IN THE LOWER MURRAY-DARLING BASIN, AUSTRALIA, FROM THIN-SECTIONED OTOLITHS	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Transverse thin sections (0.5 mm thick) of sagittal otoliths from 290 Murray cod up to 1400 mm in total length and 47.3 kg in weight were used to establish the age and growth of cod in the lower Murray-Darling Basin, including comparisons of recent (1986-91) and past (1949-51) growth rates and growth in different waters. The maximum estimated age was 48 years. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of the seasonal changes in otolith marginal increments showed that annuli in fish of all ages were laid down each spring, and 1 October was assigned as the birthday. The thin-sectioning method was validated by comparing age estimates for 55 Murray cod from Lake Charlegrark (age 0-21 years), which had been validated by using burnt and polished half-otoliths. The new method had an accuracy of 96-4% and it offers major advantages in ease of preparation, reading, and batch-handling of large numbers of otoliths. The precision of the method, estimated as an average error for four readers, was 5.4% (3.0% after ignoring discrepancies in relation to annuli on otolith edges). There was a linear relationship between otolith weight and fish age and an exponential relationship between otolith weight and fish length. Both otolith length and otolith width reached an asymptote at about 15 years, when fish length also approached its maximum. However, otolith thickness continued to increase throughout the life of the fish and, after about 15 years, contributed most to the increase in otolith weight. This confirmed that otoliths continued to grow in thickness and that annuli were laid down throughout life, and that cod could be aged reliably to the maximum age. The annulus pattern is very clear and distinct, and the reading techniques are fully described, including recognition of 'larval' and 'false' rings. Various differences were found in the growth rates, and the length-weight relationships for males and females, for cod caught in 1986-91 and those caught in 1949-51, and various subpopulations are discussed. The von Bertalanffy growth parameters (all individuals combined) were estimated at L(infinity) = 1202 mm, k = 0.108 and t0 = -0-832. The availability of a reliable ageing method provides the first opportunity to determine year of birth and thus to examine the age structure of populations and to effectively manage cod populations that have declined in abundance.																			0067-1940						1992	43	5					983	1013		10.1071/MF9920983	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF9920983													WOS:A1992KU72900007

Analysis of a fragmentary diatom record from Lake Van (Turkey) reveals substantial lake-level variability during previous interglacials MIS7 and MIS5e	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY					6th International Limnogeology Congress (ILIC) of the International-Association-of-Limnogeology (IAL)	JUN 15-19, 2015	Reno, NV					Ancient lake sediments provide opportunities to reconstruct aquatic ecosystems during previous interglacials. In the summer of 2010, the ICDP project PALEOVAN drilled a complete succession of the lacustrine sedimentary sequence deposited during the last similar to 600,000 years in Lake Van, eastern Anatolia (Turkey). Previous palaeolimnological analysis of the Lake Van sediment record has shown diatoms to be absent over most of the sequence apart from a short interval during the Holocene. Here, we demonstrate the preservation of additional fragmentary diatom records during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 7 (243,000-191,000 years ago; Lisiecki and Raymo in Paleoceanography 20:PA1003, 2005; Jouzel et al. in Science 317:793-796, 2007) and MIS5e (130,000-116,000 years ago; Lisiecki and Raymo 2005; Jouzel et al. 2007), each spanning no more than a few thousand years. Although brief, the presence of contrasting diatom assemblages between these two interglacials provide a snapshot of varying water depth and, by inference, climate. Analysis of MIS7e samples suggests that lake water levels were low after a period when the lake was open (i.e., high lake levels with the presence of an outflow present), resulting in higher salinities and possibly less stable bottom waters, which switched between anoxic and oxic states more frequently. By contrast, the diatom assemblages during MIS5e are characteristic of fresh, relatively nutrient rich waters. This suggests that lake levels were high, that the lake was hydrologically open with an outlet, and that the bottom waters were anoxic for long periods of time. Furthermore, our palaeoconductivity estimates and modelling of the past lake volumes with respect to its salt content support the presence of an outflow.

The present-day climate of Cordillera Oriental, in arid northwestern Argentina, is influenced by shifts in subtropical climate systems, including the South American Summer Monsoon. To understand better past glacier-subtropical climates during the global Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 26.5-19 ka) and other time periods, we combined geomorphic features with forty-two precise Be-10 ages on moraine boulders and reconstructed paleo-equilibrium line altitudes (ELA) at Nevado de Chani(24 degrees S) in the arid subtropical Andes. We found a major glacial expansion at similar to 23 +/- 1.6 ka, that is, during the global LGM. Additional glacial expansions are observed before the global LGM (at similar to 52-39 ka), and after, at 15 +/- 0.5 and 12 +/- 0.6 ka. The similar to 15 ka glacial event was found on both sides of Chani and the similar to 12 ka event is only recorded on the east side. Reconstructed ELAs of the former glaciers exhibit a rise from east to west that resembles the present subtropical climate trajectory from the Atlantic side of the continent; hence, we infer that this climate pattern must have been present in the past. Based on comparison with other low-latitude paleoclimate records, such as those from lakes and caves, we infer that both temperature and precipitation influenced past glacial occurrence in this sector of the arid Andes. Our findings also imply that abrupt deglacial climate events associated with the North Atlantic, specifically curtailed meridional overturning circulation and regional cooling, may have had attendant impacts on low subtropical Southern Hemisphere latitudes, including the climate systems that affect glacial activity around Nevado de Chani.

A three-dimensional model of water circulation and temperature structure in the Caspian Sea	ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS IN COASTAL REGIONS VI: INCLUDING OIL SPILL STUDIES	WIT Transactions on Ecology and the Environment				6th International Conference on Environmental Problems in Coastal Regions	JUN 05-07, 2006	Rhodes, GREECE	Wesse Inst Technol, WIT Transact Ecol & Environm				This research is based on a numerical model for forecasting the threedimensional behaviour of (sea) water motion due to the effect of the variable wind velocity. The results obtained are then analyzed and compared with observations. This model is based on the equations that overcome the current and distribution of temperature by applying the method of finite difference by assuming Delta x, Delta y as constant and Delta z as variable. The model has been evaluated according to the reports and observations. Through studying the position of the current in different layers, the velocity in the cross section in the northern, southern and the middle layers will be discussed. The results reveal the presence of the circulation cells in the three above-mentioned areas. The circulation is reduced with increase in depth. The current velocity throughout the whole fields is different. The first layer current velocity is calculated to be between 1.6 cm/s and 15 cm/s. It seems that the maximum velocity in the middle is considered by the maximum wind velocity 7m/s and wind stress (tau(x), = tau(y) = 0.07N/m(2)). The results obtained through the numerical solution of the temperature equation have been compared with the observations. The temperature change in different layers in the cross section illustrates the relative harmony of the model mentioned.

J	KRIEGER, KA				KRIEGER, KA			SNAIL DISTRIBUTIONS IN LAKE ERIE - THE INFLUENCE OF ANOXIA IN THE SOUTHERN CENTRAL BASIN NEARSHORE ZONE	OHIO JOURNAL OF SCIENCE												The distribution and abundances or gastropods collected in sediment grab samples in 1978 and 1979 in the southern nearshore zone of the central basin of Lake Erie were compared with earlier gastropod records from throughout the lake. Since the 1920s, 34 species in eight families have been reported for the lake proper. Sixteen species have been reported only once, 13 of them in three reports prior to 1950. All but three of the species collected by two or more authors prior to the mid-1950s have also been collected in the past decade. The most frequently reported species are Valvata tricarinata, Bithynia tentaculata, Elimia (= Goniobasis) livescens, Physella "sp.", Amnicola limosa, Pleurocera acuta and V. sincera. Only six of 19 studies reported species densities, and most did not record sample locations, depths or substrates. Thus, only a limited comparison of the gastropod fauna between studies was possible, with the exception of several well documented studies in the western basin up to the early 1960s. Of four introduced species in Lake Erie, only two were found in the present study, and these appear to have no influence on the present distributions of the native species. The absence of snails in the southwestern part of the study area and at the mouths of the Cuyahoga and Black rivers appears to be the result of prolonged anoxia during one or more summers preceding the study.																			0030-0950					DEC	1985	85	5					230	243																WOS:A1985AXB1700002
J	Hopley, CA; Jones, BG				Hopley, Carl A.; Jones, Brian G.			Holocene evolution and depositional model of a bayhead delta, Lake Illawarra, Australia	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Extensive research into the evolution of wave-dominated estuaries has been documented since the 1960s. However, there has only been limited research on the prograding bay-head deltas that are the primary drivers for the rate and stage of estuary evolution. This paper presents the findings of a high-resolution spatial study into the evolution of the Macquarie Rivulet bayhead delta in the Lake Illawarra barrier estuary. The delta's evolution has been established based on sedimentological analysis of 74 cores, two C-14 ages and 45 amino acid racemization ages. This study intersected two Pleistocene and 10 Holocene sedimentary facies associations representing both the retrogradational and progradational phases of delta development. The distribution of bayhead delta facies associations in shallow barrier estuaries is initially controlled by the antecedent morphology, but, in contrast to deeper estuaries, this influence decreases as sedimentation proceeds. Changing relative sea level also has a major control on facies distribution with transgressive facies deposited as relative sea-level rises being replaced by prograding deltaic facies during the highstand and subsequent minor relative sea-level fall. Fluvial sediment supply and river flood events affect the rate of delta progradation, and produce low and high flow sediment deposits within the overall deltaic sequence. The low tidal flux in barrier estuaries, the muddy cohesive nature of the sediments and the prevalence of bioturbation means that primary sedimentary structures are rarely preserved in these bayhead delta facies. The depositional model of bayhead delta evolution shown by the Macquarie Rivulet delta would be widely applicable to other similar barrier estuary settings.

J	Costa, K; Russell, J; Konecky, B; Lamb, H				Costa, Kassandra; Russell, James; Konecky, Bronwen; Lamb, Henry			Isotopic reconstruction of the African Humid Period and Congo Air Boundary migration at Lake Tana, Ethiopia	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The African Humid Period of the early to mid-Holocene (12,000-5000 years ago) had dramatic ecological and societal consequences, including the expansion of vegetation and civilization into the "green Sahara." While the humid period itself is well documented throughout northern and equatorial Africa, mechanisms behind observed regional variability in the timing and magnitude of the humid period remain disputed. This paper presents a new hydrogen isotope record from leaf waxes (delta D-wax) in a 15,000-year sediment core from Lake Tana, Ethiopia (12 degrees N, 37 degrees E) to provide insight into the timing, duration, and intensity of the African Humid Period over northeastern Africa. delta D-wax at Lake Tana ranges between -80 parts per thousand. and -170 parts per thousand, with an abrupt transition from D-enriched to D-depleted waxes between 13,000 -11,500 years before present (13-11.5 ka). A similarly abrupt transition from D-depleted to D-enriched waxes occurs ca 8.5-8 ka and is followed by generally D-enriched waxes throughout the late Holocene. Trends in delta D-wax covary with changes in Northern Hemisphere summer insolation and reflect increased precipitation at Lake Tana during the AHP; however, the transition from D-depleted to D-enriched waxes occurs earlier at Lake Tana (ca 8 ka, vs 5 ka) than in many other regional records, and the amplitude of D-depletion during the AHP is larger at Lake Tana as well. We attribute this early enrichment to a reduction of moisture derived from westerly sources (the Congo Basin and Atlantic Ocean) which we suggest are D-depleted relative to moisture sourced from the east (Indian Ocean) and the north (Red Sea and Mediterranean Sea). Our new record highlights the importance of both the northward migration of the tropical rain belt as well as east-west migration of the Congo Air Boundary to precipitation source and amount during the African Humid Period.

Strong gene flow and lack of stable population structure in the face of rapid adaptation to local temperature in a spring-spawning salmonid, the European grayling (Thymallus thymallus)	HEREDITY												Gene flow has the potential to both constrain and facilitate adaptation to local environmental conditions. The early stages of population divergence can be unstable because of fluctuating levels of gene flow. Investigating temporal variation in gene flow during the initial stages of population divergence can therefore provide insights to the role of gene flow in adaptive evolution. Since the recent colonization of Lake Lesjaskogsvatnet in Norway by European grayling (Thymallus thymallus), local populations have been established in over 20 tributaries. Multiple founder events appear to have resulted in reduced neutral variation. Nevertheless, there is evidence for local adaptation in early life-history traits to different temperature regimes. In this study, microsatellite data from almost a decade of sampling were assessed to infer population structuring and its temporal stability. Several alternative analyses indicated that spatial variation explained 2-3 times more of the divergence in the system than temporal variation. Over all samples and years, there was a significant correlation between genetic and geographic distance. However, decomposed pairwise regression analysis revealed differing patterns of genetic structure among local populations and indicated that migration outweighs genetic drift in the majority of populations. In addition, isolation by distance was observable in only three of the six years, and signals of population bottlenecks were observed in the majority of samples. Combined, the results suggest that habitat-specific adaptation in this system has preceded the development of consistent population substructuring in the face of high levels of gene flow from divergent environments.

J	Sikka, D; Nehru, CE				Sikka, D; Nehru, CE			Review of Precambrian porphyry Cu+/-Mo+/-Au deposits with special reference to Malanjkhand porphyry copper deposit, Madhya Pradesh, India	JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA												Precambrian porphyry type Cu+/-Mo+/-Au deposits are present in many parts of the world including Australia, Brazil, Canada China, Finland, India, Namibia, Russia, Sweden, and Zambia. Mast of them are associated with calc-alkaline or alkaline subduction lone volcanics or granitoids of the I-type. Precambrian deposits range in age from 3314+/-6 Ma to 561+/-9 Ma. The majority of the deposits fall into four age groupings with peaks around 3300+/-100Ma, 1900+/-100Ma, 1900+100 Ma, and 1100 +/- 100 Ma which are indicative of major tectonic and magmatic episodes in different parts of the world. Precambrian deposits have many similarities with the younger porphyry copper deposits in the Phanerozoic. Same outstanding examples include Malanjkhand deposit (789 Mt x 0.83% Cu; 0.004% Mo; 0.2 gm/T Au; 6 gm/T Ag) and Tongkuangyu, China (380 Mt x 0.67% Cu) are in production. The Troilus Lake deposit, Quebec, Canada (42.9 Mtx 0.12% Cu; 1.4 gm/t Au; 1.4 gm/ t Ag) and Haib River, Namibia (600 Mt x 0.3% Cu) are being considered for exploitation. After a review of the salient features of porphyry Cu+/-Mo+/-Au deposits in general and those of the Precambrian porphyry Cu+/-Mo+/-Au age in particular, it is suggested that Precambrian terrains should be good targets for exploration.																			0016-7622					MAR	1997	49	3					239	288																WOS:A1997WL77800002

A segmentation algorithm was used to classify lakes and drained thaw lake basins (DTLBs) exceeding I ha in size. A total of 13,214 lakes and 6539 DTLBs were identified. Several indices were obtained from the image processing software and used for a comparative analysis of lakes and basins including object size, goodness of elliptic fit, shape complexity, shape asymmetry, and orientation of the major axis. Nonparametric statistical analyses indicate that lakes and basins share similar orientation only. Three subregions of the western Arctic Coastal Plain were identified based on landscape age, as demarcated by ancient shorelines. The surfaces become progressively older inland and include the Younger Outer Coastal Plain, the Outer Coastal Plain, and the oldest Inner Coastal Plain. Lakes and basins in all subregions have statistically similar orientation, indicating that summer wind direction has not changed appreciably over the past several thousand years. Basin orientation is less clustered than lake orientation. Lakes are highly elliptical, while basins have more complex shapes. Lake coverage (%) is fairly constant across the three subregions, while DTLB coverage decreases on older surfaces. Lake and basin size decreases on progressively older surfaces, but the number of features per unit area increases. It is uncertain if surface age is responsible for differences in regional metrics as an analysis of the Inner Coastal Plain demonstrates significant internal variation. Distance from the coast, ground ice content, surficial sediments. and local relief may also influence lake morphometry. Copyright (C) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Potential impacts of climate and environmental change on the stored water of Lake Victoria Basin and economic implications	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												The changing climatic patterns and increasing human population within the Lake Victoria Basin (LVB), together with overexploitation of water for economic activities call for assessment of water management for the entire basin. This study focused on the analysis of a combination of available in situ climate data, Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE), Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) observations, and high resolution Regional Climate simulations during recent decade(s) to assess the water storage changes within LVB that may be linked to recent climatic variability/changes and anomalies. We employed trend analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), and temporal/spatial correlations to explore the associations and covariability among LVB stored water, rainfall variability, and large-scale forcings associated with El-Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). Potential economic impacts of human and climate-induced changes in LVB stored water are also explored. Overall, observed in situ rainfall from lake-shore stations showed a modest increasing trend during the recent decades. The dominant patterns of rainfall data from the TRMM satellite estimates suggest that the spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation have not changed much during the period of 1998-2012 over the basin consistent with in situ observations. However, GRACE-derived water storage changes over LVB indicate an average decline of 38.2 mm/yr for 2003-2006, likely due to the extension of the Owen Fall/Nalubale dam, and an increase of 4.5 mm/yr over 2007-2013, likely due to two massive rainfalls in 2006-2007 and 2010-2011. The temporal correlations between rainfall and ENSO/IOD indices during the study period, based on TRMM and model simulations, suggest significant influence of large-scale forcing on LVB rainfall, and thus stored water. The contributions of ENSO and IOD on the amplitude of TRMM-rainfall and GRACE-derived water storage changes, for the period of 2003-2013, are estimated to be approximate to 2.5 cm and approximate to 1.5 cm, respectively.

J	Riley, JW; Marsden, JE				Riley, Jacob W.; Marsden, J. Ellen			Predation on emergent lake trout fry in Lake Champlain	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The rehabilitation of extirpated lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) in the Great Lakes and Lake Champlain has been hindered by various biological and physiological impediments. Efforts to restore a lake trout fishery to Lake Champlain include hatchery stocking and sea lamprey control. Despite these management actions, there is little evidence of recruitment of naturally-produced fish in annual fall assessments. Spawning occurs at Multiple sites lake-wide in Lake Champlain, with extremely high egg and fry densities, yet sampling for juvenile lake trout has only yielded fin-clipped fish. To investigate this recruitment bottleneck, we assessed predation pressure by epi-benthic fish on emergent fry on two spawning reefs and the subsequent survival and dispersal of fry in potential nursery areas. Epi-benthic predators were sampled with 2-h gillnet sets at two small, shallow sites in Lake Champlain throughout the 24-h cycle, with an emphasis on dusk and dawn hours. In total, we documented seven different species that had consumed fry, with consumption rates from I to 17 fry per stomach, Rock bass and yellow perch dominated the near-shore fish community and were the most common fry predators. Predator presence and consumption of fry was highest between 19:00 and 07:00. Predators only consumed fry when fry relative abundance was above a threshold of 1 fry trap(-1) day(-1). We used an otter trawl to sample for post-emergent fry adjacent to the reef, but did not capture any age-0 lake trout. Due to the observed predation pressure by multiple littoral, species on shallow spawning reefs, lake trout restoration may be more successful at deep, offshore sites. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The Late Weichselian Gotiglacial varved clays of the Swedish Time Scale could potentially be used for this purpose. The reliability of the Swedish Time Scale is discussed as well as different ways of using the Swedish varved clays for calibrating the C-14 chronology. The strategy and initial results from an ongoing calibration project are presented. They show clearly that, if the right strategy is adopted, varved clay may be dated by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) C-14 measurement of terrestrial macrofossils. A Late Weichselian 'event stratigraphy', including the Vedde Ash fall-out, is established for south Scandinavia using three dating categories: clay varve measurements, terrestrial macrofossil measurement, and lake sediment (including aquatic mosses) measurements. It suggests that a C-14 chronology based on terrestrial organic remains is not consistent with the traditional Late Weichselian chronostratigraphy based on lake-sediment samples, and that 'clay varve years' exceed 'terrestrial C-14 years' by c. 900 years at the end of, and by 1100-1200 years at the beginning of the Younger Dryas Chronozone. Further back in time, the time-scales appear to converge. These results are compared with other recently published calibration studies.

A sequence stratigraphic model for the Upper Miocene-Pliocene basin fill of the Pannonian Basin, eastern Hungary	MARINE AND PETROLEUM GEOLOGY												Interpretations of subsurface data and computer simulations of basin-fill history in the late Neogene Pannonian Basin of eastern Hungary established a regional stratigraphic model presented in this paper. Three fluvial systems overfilled the basin: a large system from the NE, another from the NW and a third smaller system transported sediments from the territory of Romania, from the SE. Large part of the basin had been filled by Messinian time (late Miocene); the remaining lake was located in southeastern Hungary and neighboring countries. In the Tortonian stage, the three fluvial systems advanced concomitantly (with small-scale, high-frequency cycles), toward the basin center. A significant relative lake-level drop occurred in the Messinian, which induced large-scale erosion and fluvial incision and generated an unconformity surface that provides a major division in the Pannonian strata; it appears as a significant stratigraphic divide that separates two different stages in the history of the Pannonian Basin. In the upper Messinian-Pliocene stage, the basin underwent a tectonic inversion; the shallow lake was filled up rapidly by lowstand turbidites and prograding delta-slope sediments. The inversion continues up to the present day. Turbidites and lowstand prograding wedges associated with the Messinian event may be targets for hydrocarbon exploration. Four main stages can be identified in the Upper Miocene-Pliocene basin fill history: (1) Tortonian highstand regression with several low-rank relative lake-level cycles; (2) Messinian lake-level drop, accompanied by the formation of the "Messinian unconformity" and the deposition of a falling-stage systems tract (FST). The "Messinian unconformity" is a composite surface, represented by a subaerial unconformity at the margins, and a basal surface of forced regression in the depocenters; (3) relative rise of lake level, when the FST turned to a lowstand systems tract (LST); (4) tectonic inversion (basinward tilt and marginal uplift) during or at the beginning of the LST.

The limnological context from which the iron-rich fraction was isolated was characterized using a combination of in situ probes and analytical chemistry. An iron-rich coloidal particulate was identified; three morphotypes occurred, two of which could be described as globular and one of which as near-globular in shape. The size range determined by TEM was 0.05-0.21 .mu.m, with three quarters falling in the narrow range of 0.05-0.13 .mu.m. The latter range was found to be more representative of the true particle size distribution than a distribution found by filtration alone, which suggested an average paticle size greater than 0.45 .mu.m. Among the entire population of these colloids, ca. 70% contained iron whereas most of the remaining 30% were rich in either Si or Ca. Amongst the iron-rich globules, 86.5% were also rich in phosphorus and calcium. Some evidence was found to suggest that Fe/P/Ca-rich particles were occasionally associated with eithe rSi or Si/Al; however, the major fraction of these particles was found to contain exclusively Fe, P and Ca. These new findings are presented in the context of the limnological phenomena documented at the site.																			0003-9136					SEP	1988	113	3					405	424																WOS:A1988Q334800006

Phytoplankton nutrient limitation in a polymictic eutrophic lake: community versus species-specific responses	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												Phytoplankton nutrient limitation was examined in polymictic, eutrophic Lake Rotorua, New Zealand using three in situ incubation experiments of 4 to 6 days' duration in summer 2004. Two of the incubations were conducted during stratification, and one immediately after breakdown of stratification. Samples were enriched with ammonium (1 mg NH4-N L-1), phosphate (0.1 mg PO4-P L-1) or with both nutrients. A control containing no added nutrients was used for comparison. Phytoplankton responses to nutrient additions were determined at a species level from cell counts and at a community level from changes in chlorophyll-a concentration. Phytopiankton biomass generally responded to N plus P additions to a greater extent than with single nutrient additions, though results were often not statistically significant. Increase in community biomass was greater for P than N, and nutrient demand decreased after breakdown of stratification. Individual species responded differently to N and P additions, suggesting co-limitation within the phytoplankton species assemblage. A simple, dynamic phytoplankton growth limitation model, with time-varying responses to hourly inputs of temperature, nutrients and light, was applied to consider the interacting effects of phosphorus (P), nitrogen (N) and light. Model results indicate that light plays a major role in regulating phytoplankton biomass, although there were periods of P limitation. For the management of water quality in Lake Rotorua it is suggested that simultaneous reductions in external inputs of both N and P is mostly likely to reduce phytoplankton biomass, including cyanobacterial populations.

Thus, we conducted a multi-year study on the ecology of both organisms in brackish environments of the Sada River, a drainage canal flowing slowly into the Japan Sea from Lake Shinji in Shimane Prefecture, Japan. Water samples were collected twice a month at five sites from August 2000 to May 2002. Both organisms were enumerated in 101 water, 100 g sediment and 10 g shellfish by the most probable number (MPN) procedure. Isolates were confirmed as V. vulnificus using hemolysin gene PCR. During the last 7 months (including winter) of the study, water and sediment samples were also analyzed for the presence of both organisms. V. parahaemolyticus was isolated from river mouths and coastal environments of average salinity greater than or equal to4.4 +/- 2.0 ppt throughout the year at cell concentrations of 10(-3) to 10(1) MPN ml(-1). Similar concentrations of V. vulnificus were isolated from coastal environments of average salinity 24.0 +/- 5.4 ppt, except for two times when water moved to the upper reaches due to high tide and V. vulnificus was rifted to the upper reaches. These findings suggest that both organisms are continuously distributed in the Sada estuary throughout the year regardless of water temperature.

Variation in the diversity of bacterial communities and potential sources of fecal contamination of beaches in the Huron to Erie corridor	WATER RESEARCH												Understanding the diversity of bacteria and E.coli levels at beaches is important for managing health risks. This study compared temporal changes of the bacterial communities of Belle Isle Beach (Detroit, MI) and Sand Point Beach (Windsor, ONT), both located near the Lake St. Clair origin of the Detroit River. Water samples collected 4 days/week for 12 weeks in summer, were subjected to 16S rRNA analysis of amplicon sequencing and E. coli enumeration. Bacterial communities changed over time, as determined by cluster dendmgram analysis, exhibiting different communities in July and August than in June and different communities at the two beaches. After June, alpha diversity decreased and relative abundance of Enterobacter (Gammaproteobacteria) increased at Sand Point; whereas, Belle Isle maintained its alpha diversity and dominance by Betaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria. Contamination at both beaches is dominated by birds (23% to 50% of samples), while only similar to 10% had evidence of human-associated bacteria. High E. coli at both beaches was often associated with precipitation. Nearshore sampling counts were higher than waist-deep sampling counts. Despite the dynamic changes in bacterial communities between the two beaches, this analysis based on 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing is able to provide information about bacterial types associated with high E. coli levels and to use bacterial sequences to more precisely determine sources and health relevance of contaminants.					; Hashemi Shahraki, Abdolrazagh/AAG-2663-2021; Chaganti, Subba/AAO-8118-2020	Ram, Jeffrey/0000-0002-1063-546X; Seth, Rajesh/0000-0003-4903-8467; Chaganti, Subba Rao/0000-0001-9796-3986; Hashemi Shahraki, Abdolrazagh/0000-0003-1852-194X; 													0043-1354	1879-2448				AUG 15	2022	222								118913	10.1016/j.watres.2022.118913	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2022.118913		AUG 2022						35940154					WOS:000843014900002

Modeling Habitat Potential for Canada Lynx in Michigan	WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN												In the ruling to list Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) as a federally threatened species, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) identified the Great Lakes region as an area that historically contained lynx and, hence, could potentially contribute to population recovery. More recent critical habitat designations by the USFWS only recognize Minnesota, USA as important to recovery in the Great Lakes. Although there is no current evidence of a resident lynx population in the Upper Peninsula (UP) of Michigan, USA, trapping and track records over the past century suggest the region was periodically invaded after lynx population irruptions in Canada. In support of state and federal agency efforts in Michigan to provide and conserve lynx habitat, we quantified habitat potential using a spatially explicit, landscape-level model based on relationships among lynx, their primary prey, snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus), and vegetation attributes. Outputs from the model indicated that habitat in the UP supports low hare densities (<0.07-0.75 hares/ha). Corresponding potential lynx densities ranged from 0/100 km(2) in the southern and northeast UP to 5/100 km 2 in the central-eastern UP. Model estimates of potential hare density were correlated with winter track-surveys (R-2 = 0.4, P < 0.001). Current absence of a resident lynx population in Michigan is likely attributed to confounding factors (e.g., habitat, competition, status of source population) but our results indicate that current habitat quality, quantity, and spatial configuration are exerting large-scale negative influences. These results are generally consistent with the USFWS determination that Michigan's UP most likely functions as dispersal habitat.

To ensure that this discharge does not adversely affect water quality in the receiving environment, local regulations specify maximum levels in the discharge for a number of parameters, including enterococci. Between 2001 and 2006, regulations required fewer than 300 enterococci per 100 ml in summer. During this period, the discharge intermittently exceeded this limit, with unexplained levels of enterococci of up to 180,000/100 ml. Characterization of these enterococci by antibiotic resistance analysis showed that enterococci sampled over 4 months had almost identical resistance profiles. In contrast, enterococci from raw sewage and wildfowl from around the oxidation ponds had a diverse range of antibiotic resistance profiles that could be distinguished from each other and also from those of enterococci from the discharge. The hypothesis of a clonal nature of the enterococci in the discharge was supported by molecular genotype analysis, suggesting that these bacteria may have replicated in the pond environment rather than being reflective of breakthrough in the sewage treatment process or the result of recent wildfowl inputs to the ponds. This study highlights the usefulness of antibiotic resistance analysis in identifying this phenomenon and is the first report of apparent replication of a specific type of enterococci in an oxidation pond environment.

J	Horvatincic, N; Calic, R; Geyh, MA				Horvatincic, N; Calic, R; Geyh, MA			Interglacial growth of tufa in Croatia	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Tufa samples from the Krka River area in Croatia were dated by C-14 and Th-230/U-234 methods. The study area is situated in the karst region of the southern Dinarides. C-14 ages of 40 tufa samples collected at the waterfalls coincide with the early, Holocene interglaciation, up to 6000 C-14 yr B.P. Comparison of conventional C-14 dates of Holocene tufa and those of speleothems in the Dinaric Karst shows that speleothem formation started several thousand years earlier than tufa growth. Samples of old tufa deposits from the Krka River (17) and Plitvice Lakes (12) area and speleothem samples from caves in Dinaric Karst (5) yield 34 230Th/234U dates, most of which cluster around interglacial marine delta(18)O stage 5 (21). Eight of 13 older dates belong to interglacial stages 7 and 9; only 5 dates fall within stage 6 and 8 glaciations. Th-230/U-234 dates of speleothems and tufa samples from central Europe have indicated that these were formed preferentially during warm and humid interglacial and interstadial periods, and it appears that this is true of southern Croatia as well. Stable isotope (delta(13)C, delta(18)O) analyses of 40 tufa samples from the Krka River area were compared with stable isotope analyses of tufa from the Plitvice Lakes area. The delta(13)C values for both locations are similar and range from -10 to -6 parts per thousand, indicating similar conditions of tufa formation. A systematic difference between the delta(18)O values of tufa in these two areas reflects the regional distribution of the oxygen composition of precipitation, (C) 2000 University of Washington.																			0033-5894					MAR	2000	53	2					185	195		10.1006/qres.1999.2094	http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/qres.1999.2094													WOS:000085958200006

Based on functional traits, bearing trees were classified as either pyrophilic or pyrophobic, applied to Public Land Survey points, and the pyrophilic percentage was calculated for each point. Kriging was applied to this point database to create a continuous surface of pyrophilic percentages. Regression analysis was used to relate this surface to environmental factors. Regression models created separately for each study area explained 38 to 53% of the variation in pyrophilic percentage. A positive association between pyrophilic percentage and distance to water and summer potential evapotranspiration was consistent across all study sites. The consistently high values and spatial patterns of pyrophilic percentage revealed fire-dominated landscapes interspersed with patches of pyrophobic vegetation. The restriction of pyrophobic areas to the leeside (east) of waterbodies indicated these served as firebreaks in a fire-swept landscape. Lake Michigan must have had a profound effect on pre- Euro-American settlement fire environments, serving as a massive physical firebreak while casting a moist maritime climate eastward. In southern and southwestern Illinois, the Mississippi River and associated tributaries along with an increase in topographic complexity also served as firebreaks, with pyrophobic forests restricted to riparian zones which progressively graded to pyrophilic vegetation on surrounding uplands. Our analysis expands the use of Public Land Survey data by converting bearing trees into a meaningful fire ecology index. While much of the landscape included in our study area is now in agriculture or urbanized, pyrophilic percentage maps can help guide land managers in the application of fire for restoration, conservation, and forestry purposes.

Candidatus 'Chloroploca asiatica' gen. nov., sp nov., a New Mesophilic Filamentous Anoxygenic Phototrophic Bacterium	MICROBIOLOGY												Five phylogenetically similar monocultures of mesophilic filamentous anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria (FAPB) were isolated from microbial mats of low-mineral (5-28 g/L) alkaline lakes in Buryat Republic, Transbaikalia and Mongolia, as well as from biofilms of an alkaline sulfide spring (3 g/L) of the Umhei hydrothermal system (Buryat Republic). New isolates were characterized by short trichomes (15-30 mu m long and similar to 1 mu m in diameter), straight, curved, or wavy, surrounded by a thin iron-sorbing mucous sheath. Gliding motion of the trichomes was not observed. The trichomes formed bunches consisting of several filaments. Trichomes multiply by the separation of short fragments or single cells from the parental trichome. The cells in the filaments were elongated; they contained chlorosomes, gas vesicles, poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate granules, and small polyphosphate inclusions. Bacteria contained bacteriochlorophylls c and a and gamma-carotene. Absorption maxima of the pigments in the cells were observed at 462, (shoulder at 515), 742, 805, and 863 nm. The organisms were strict anaerobes capable of photoautotrophic growth with sulfide as an electron donor. Elemental sulfur emerged into the medium as a result of sulfide photooxidation. The organisms were tolerant to sulfide (up to 8 mM). Best growth occurred at pH 8.0, 3-15 g/L NaCl, and 1-5 g/L sodium bicarbonate. According to phylogenetic analysis, the 16S rRNA gene sequences of the FAPB isolates formed a separate cluster most closely related to the species cluster of the family Oscillochloridaceae, suborder Chloroflexinae, order Chloroflexales, class Chloroflexi. The differences with the closest 16S rRNA gene sequences of the known FAPB were 9-10%. The formal description of a new taxon, Candidatus 'Chloroploca asiatica' gen. nov., sp. nov., is provided.

This is threatening the resilience of cropping systems, although many crops show strong adaptation abilities. How interactions between climate change and increases in the atmospheric CO2 concentration ([CO2]) will ultimately affect regional crop production, including growth processes and water utilization, is not well understood. Climate variability has different effects on agriculture depending on the type of water resources (i.e., rain-fed vs. irrigated crops). To date, however, there have been no reports on disparities in the responses of crop productivity and water consumption to climate change between irrigated and rain-fed agricultural production at identical latitudes. We aimed to compare the responses of maize crops, in terms of productivity and water consumption, between two mid-high latitude regions under various climate change scenarios, with and without considering the effects of elevated [CO2]. The Southwestern Plain of the Great Lakes (SPG) located in the U.S. Corn Belt and the Northeast Plain (NEPC) located in the China Corn Belt were selected as irrigated and rain-fed case study areas, respectively. Using the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator with three global climate models under two representative concentration path emission scenarios in combination with six CO2 trajectories, the risks and opportunities of global warming for maize crops, in terms of growth and water consumption, were characterized at a regional scale from the viewpoint of the water footprint concept. The influence of climate warming on maize crops will be stronger in the SPG than in the NEPC in terms of the future average length of the whole growing season duration (GSD-w), yield, and water consumption. The sowing date and maize variety were kept constant in these simulations. The model predicted that the protective effect of elevated [CO2] on maize GSD-w will not be as significant as that on yield. Our results indicate that elevated [CO2] could reduce the water intensity per unit yield of maize by 159.2 m3/t, on average, in the two study regions. The results of this study provide insights into the risks and opportunities of climate change for irrigated and rain-fed maize cropping systems in mid-high-latitude regions.

In 2007, the Great Lakes freshwater strain, type IVb, caused a large die-off of freshwater drum (Aplodinotus grunniens) in Lake Winnebago, Wisconsin, USA. To evaluate the persistence and transmission of VHSV, freshwater drum from Lake Winnebago were tested for antibodies to the virus using recently developed virus neutralization (VN) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assays. Samples were also tested by real-time reverse transcription-PCR (rRT-PCR) to detect viral RNA. Of 548 serum samples tested, 44 (8.03%) were positive by VN (titers ranging from 1:16 to 1:1,024) and 45 (8.21%) were positive by ELISA, including 7 fish positive by both assays. Antibody prevalence increased with age and was higher in one northwestern area of Lake Winnebago than in other areas. Of 3,864 tissues sampled from 551 fish, 1 spleen and 1 kidney sample from a single adult female fish collected in the spring of 2012 tested positive for VHSV by rRT-PCR, and serum from the same fish tested positive by VN and ELISA. These results suggest that VHSV persists and viral transmission may be active in Lake Winnebago even in years following outbreaks and that wild fish may survive VHSV infection and maintain detectable antibody titers while harboring viral RNA. Influxes of immunologically naive juvenile fish through recruitment may reduce herd immunity, allow VHSV to persist, and drive superannual cycles of transmission that may sporadically manifest as fish kills.

J	Earnst, SL; Rothe, TC				Earnst, SL; Rothe, TC			Habitat selection by Tundra Swans on northern Alaska breeding grounds	WATERBIRDS												Habitat selection by the Tundra Swan (Cygnus columbianus columbianus) was evaluated on the Colville River Delta prior to oil field development (1982-1989). Tundra Swan territories comprised a lake, used for refuge and foraging, and terrestrial habitats and ponds near the lake's perimeter used for foraging and nesting. Tundra swan sightings from early and late summer aerial surveys were used to investigate habitat selection at the territory and within-territory scale. At the territory or lake scale, swan sightings/lake increased with lake size, and increased from discrete to tapped (i.e., connected to a river channel) to drained lakes within size categories. Overall, 49% of the variation in swan sightings/lake was explained by lake size and type, a size-x-type interaction term, and the proportion of lake perimeter comprised of Halophytic Ponds and Halophytic Wet Meadows. At the within-territory or within-lake scale, foraging swans significantly selected Halophytic Ponds, Halophytic Wet Meadows, and Fresh Ponds relative to Uplands; nesting swans significantly selected Halophytic Ponds and significantly avoided Fresh Wet Meadows relative to Uplands. Vegetation sampling indicated that sites used by Tundra Swans on river channels and tapped lakes were significantly more likely to have Sheathed Pondweed (Potamogeton vaginatus) than control sites. The three major components of Tundra Swan diet were Carex sedges, Sheathed Pondweed, and algae, together comprising 85% of identifiable plant fragments in feces.																			1524-4695	1938-5390				JUN	2004	27	2					224	233		10.1675/1524-4695(2004)027[0224:HSBTSO]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1675/1524-4695(2004)027[0224:HSBTSO]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000222000900014

The total wetland area of the watershed is estimated to be 32,157 ha. These wetlands have different physical and hydrological, chemical and water quality, and biological and habitat functions. The Lake Tana watershed wetlands and its associated rivers holds about 28 species of fishes, of which fifteen are endemic, and there are over 300 species of birds recorded so far. The watershed is famous for having natural pasture land and is the home of the Fogera cattle. The wetlands in the Lake Tana watershed extend from the headwaters of Guna and Gishe-Abay to Fogera and the Dembia floodplains. The river mouths of the Gelda, Gumara, Arno-Garno, Megech, Dirma, Abagenen, Gilgel Abay and Infranz are the major delta wetland ecosystems. Yiganda and Amluk wetlands are of the lacustrine wetland type formed by the lake water while Chimba and Infranz wetlands are the common riverine wetlands. Several other wetlands are formed from cold and hot springs. There are also man-made wetlands such as the Koga Dam area and other constructed small water bodies and weirs as well. Lake Tana watershed wetlands provide habitat for globally threatened and endangered species. However, wetland loss is evident wherever major developments such as dams, irrigation schemes and conversion projects are present in the developing world. Humans usually and very dramatically accelerate natural processes. In the Lake Tana watershed, human induced threats such as conversion of wetlands into agriculture, draining of wetlands and lack of defined ownership of the resource is the main threats.

Comparisons of zooplankton and phytoplankton in created shallow water habitats of the lower Missouri River: implications for native fish	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												Shallow water habitat (SWH) is important for riverine fish and their invertebrate prey, yet the availability of SWH has declined in many systems due to human impacts. We evaluated the potential ecological benefits of restoring SWH by comparing zooplankton and phytoplankton from created backwaters (a floodplain feature connected to the river on the downstream end but disconnected at the upstream end) and chutes (a side channel of the river that diverts flow from the main channel through the chute and back into the main channel) on the lower Missouri River. We tested the hypothesis that backwaters support higher abundances of zooplankton and phytoplankton than chutes using data that were collected during the summer of 2010. As predicted, backwaters had more diverse cladoceran communities and greater abundances of rotifers, copepod nauplii, adult copepods, and cladocerans than chutes. Total algal biovolume was the same in chutes and backwaters; however, phytoplankton taxa richness was higher in backwaters, and there was a greater biovolume of green algae (Chlorophyta), Crypotophyta, cyanobacteria, and Euglenophyta in backwaters than in chutes. Differences in zooplankton and phytoplankton between backwaters and chutes appeared to be related to slower current velocities, longer retention times, and lower levels of turbidity and total suspended solids in backwaters. While chutes have the potential to provide greater habitat diversity than the mainstem, there were no differences in water quality or phytoplankton abundance, community structure, or diversity between these two habitats. Combined, our results suggest that created backwaters initially provide a greater potential food resource for native fishes. However, additional research is needed to determine whether chutes can also develop beneficial shallow water features over a longer period of time.																			1386-2588	1573-5125				MAR	2013	47	1					13	24		10.1007/s10452-012-9421-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-012-9421-0													WOS:000316009500002

BULLETIN FRANCAIS DE LA PECHE ET DE LA PISCICULTURE					1st International Conference on European Shads	MAY, 2000	BORDEAUX, FRANCE	Continental Aquat Resources Unit, INRA ENSAR, Univ Porto, French Fisheries Council				Blueback herring is an anadromous fish endemic in the tidal Hudson River Estuary, USA. Twentieth-century improvements to a lock and canal system permitted the species to invade the Hudson's main tributary, the Mohawk River, where it has been recorded since the 1930s. Moving westward over time, individuals were collected in Lake Ontario, approx. 275 km west of the Hudson, in 1997. However, the actual status (resident or marine anadromous) of adults there or in the Mohawk has not been determined. We collected adult blueback herring in the spring 1999 spawning run and analyzed their otoliths' elemental composition with both electron (WDS) and nuclear (muPIXE) microprobes. We measured strontium:calcium ratios along 4 life-history transects >> (WDS) and mapped entire otoliths (muPIXE), providing a detailed time series of data on the Sr:Ca, and thus habitat use history, of the fish. We also analyzed otoliths of Mohawk and Hudson River young-of-year (YOY). The Sr:Ca ratios of Mohawk YOY are slightly but significantly higher than those of Hudson YOY. Life history transects for 51 1 adults show complex patterns of Sr:Ca, indicating that many of the fish move into salt water at least for brief periods. However, many fish appear to spend extended parts of their post-YOY lives in fresh water, and at least two adults (caught in the Mohawk near Rome, NY) appear never to have changed habitats at all. This is thus the first demonstration of residency in Mohawk River herring.

J	Van Beynen, PE; Soto, L; Polk, J				Van Beynen, Philip E.; Soto, Limaris; Polk, Jason			Variable calcite deposition rates as proxy for paleo-precipitation determination as derived from speleothems in Central Florida, USA	JOURNAL OF CAVE AND KARST STUDIES												Deposition rates derived from speleothems have been shown to be a useful paleoclimatic proxy. Past studies have shown that the most common climatic parameter Measured by variable deposition rates is precipitation, where increased precipitation leads to increased calcite deposition. This was the premise of our study, where three Floridian stalagmites' deposition rates were measured and compared to paleohydrologic indicators taken from the sample or from other regional records. Deposition rates were measured by determining the volume of calcite precipitated between TIMS U-series dates (mm(3) yr(-1)), thereby accounting For morphological changes oil the stalagmite over its depositional history. Most prior research relied oil a simple linear interpolation between known ages to calculate rate (mm yr(-1)). Results show three distinct periods of increased deposition for our stalagmites centered oil 2.0, 1.25 and 0.5 ka BP. A comparison with Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios and calcite deposition tentatively shows elevated elemental ratios during the three aforementioned periods. Elevated trace element ratios have been shown to be correlated with increased residence time of percolation waters in the overlying bedrock above caves and consequently decreased rainfall. To corroborate this finding, paleo-precipitation records from Little Salt Spring, Florida and Lake Miragoane, Haiti, were examined for coeval and periods with our stalagmites. Both records do possess similar dry periods and provide added Support that the region experienced periods of abrupt aridity over the last two millennia. The combined effect of a change in the mean position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and the easterly winds associated with the North Atlantic High appear to be the major causes for these times of aridity.					van Beynen, Philip/G-5653-2017; Soto, Limaris/LVR-2535-2024														1090-6924	2331-3714				APR	2008	70	1					25	34																WOS:000259420200004

The main objective of this study was to compare seasonal, diel, longitudinal, transverse, and vertical variations in rates of lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens), Stizostedion spp., Catostomus spp., Moxostoma spp., quillback (Carpiodes cyprinus), and mooneye (Hiodon tergisus) larval drift in Des Prairies River (DPR) near Montreal (Quebec), which is one of the major lotic spawning habitats of the St. Lawrence River system. Larval sampling was conducted in the spring of 1994 and 1995 for the six taxa, and on a more restricted basis for lake sturgeon in 1996-1998, using drift nets set at several transects, stations, depths, and periods of the day, along a 19 km long section of river beginning ca. 2 km downstream from the DPR power house. For all taxa except lake sturgeon, peak larval drift occurred ca. 1 week earlier in 1995 than in 1994. The sequence was very similar between years, beginning with Stizostedion spp., followed by Catostomus spp., then lake sturgeon, quillback, and mooneye drifting simultaneously, and finally Moxostoma spp. Generally, for all taxa except quillback, whose multimodal drift pattern suggests intermittent, prolonged spawning, larval-drift profiles showed one major seasonal mode, which was observed simultaneously at all transects. For all taxa except quillback, drift rates peaked between 21:00 and 03:00 and were minimal during daylight hours. Lake sturgeon and Stizostedion spp. larval drift rates decreased radically from the most upstream to the most downstream transect, suggesting that both taxa spawn mostly in the vicinity of the DPR power house. More studies are required to explain this longitudinal decline in drift rates, particularly for lake sturgeon. The other taxa showed longitudinal variation in larval drift rates, suggesting that they spawn near the DPR power house and (or) in the Ile de Pierre Rapids, ca. 12 km downstream. At all transects, larval drift rates for the six taxa were generally higher in the right half (Montreal) of the river, suggesting that eggs are deposited mostly in this part of the river at the two major spawning areas and that larvae tend to remain in the same general corridors during downstream migration. For all taxa, though to a lesser extent for lake sturgeon, nocturnal drift rates tend to be higher near the surface than at mid-depth and near the bottom, the reverse situation being observed for diurnal drift rates.																			0008-4301					AUG	2001	79	8					1472	1489		10.1139/cjz-79-8-1472	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-79-8-1472													WOS:000171013200015

However, the impacts of climate change and human activities on lake shrinkage remains unclear due to short instrumental records and a lack of long-term lake-level change records. To address this issue, we reconstructed the water depth changes of Daihai Lake, a typical lake experiencing rapid shrinkage in northern China, over the last 500 years using lake-level-sensitive chironomid assemblages. We established a regional quantitative transfer function of chironomid water-depth using 54 surface sediments from Daihai Lake and Bosten Lake in northern China. The partial least squares (PLS) model yielded a coefficient of determination (R2jack) of 0.85, a maximum bias of 1.75 m, and a root mean square error prediction (RMSEP) of 1.58 m demonstrating the reliability of inferred water depth. Several diagnostic methods were used to verify the results, and they were compared with a 60-years instrumental record. The reconstructed data revealed that the lake level was low during 1500-1780 CE, gradually increasing to its peak in the 1960s and then rapidly decreasing by approximately 10 m in the last few decades. By comparing the results with regional historical documents, palynology and stalagmite records, and meteorological data, we concluded that climate change was the main driver of lake level dynamics before the 1960s, while human activities dominated the rapid shrinkage of the lake in recent decades. Our results provide a valuable limnological dataset for the water management in Daihai Lake and a reliable method for reconstruct the lake-level changes.					; sun, weiwei/GQG-8925-2022	Meng, Xianqiang/0000-0003-3088-2211; Ni, Zhenyu/0000-0002-5362-3936; 													0341-8162	1872-6887				JUN 15	2023	227								107122	10.1016/j.catena.2023.107122	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2023.107122		APR 2023											WOS:000975150700001

E.			Biogenic structures produced by foraging birds in marginal marine and marginal lacustrine settings: implications for the rock record	JOURNAL OF PALEONTOLOGY												This contribution identifies biogenic structures created by modern birds foraging in marginal aquatic settings and provides descriptions to facilitate their identification in the rock record. Biogenic structures related to foraging can be separated into those created by bills, such as peck marks, probe marks, gape marks, dabble marks, sweep marks, and bill-stir marks. Biogenic structures created by feet include stir tracks and paddle pits. Peck marks are created during visual foraging and result in shallow, solitary or paired, random or clustered, circular to subcircular pits and grooves. Probe marks are created during tactile foraging but are similar to peck marks, differing solely in their greater depth of penetration. Gape marks are formed when birds open their bill in the sediment resulting in elongated grooves. Dabble marks are larger ovoid divots emplaced by broad-billed waterbirds in subaqueous settings. Bill stirring occurs when a bird swishes its bill in a narrow trend on the sediment surface. Sweep marks are arcuate grooves emplaced in the sediment when long-billed birds forage by sweeping their bill side-to-side across the sediment-water interface.Birds shuffling their feet in soft sediment is termed 'foot-stirring' and results in overprinted, side-by-side trackways. Foot-paddling dewaters the sediment and produces various pit morphologies with massive fill. Trackways emplaced during foraging are commonly characterized by variable stride length, stutter steps, and sudden changes in direction. 'Trample grounds' are produced by gregarious foraging flocks of birds. It is anticipated that illustrating and describing the structures produced by these behaviors will facilitate recognition of these commonly overlooked traces.

Wt mimicked the habitat of a pond littoral in 4.5-m(2) plastic pools stocked with natural densities of macrophytes, invertebrates and either signal crayfish, noble crayfish. or kept as crayfish free controls. After two summer months, all invertebrates and macrophytes were collected from each pool. and periphyton was sampled on one substratum exposed and tno substrata not exposed to crayfish prating. Samples for stabile isotope analysis of benthos were collected in pools with noble crayfish. N-15 ratios showed that crayfish were top consumers, and C-13 ratios indicated that they received most of their carbon from invertebrates, but less from primary producers. Crayfish did not affect the biomass of predatory invertebrates, dominated by active swimmers among Heteroptera and Coleoptera, but had a strong impact on grazers dominated by thin-shelled Lymnaea snails. Hard-shelled Bithynia snails were also reduced in numbers, but the largest of these snails were consumed less than thin-shelled Lymnaea snails. The reduced biomass of snails had an indirect positive effect on periphyton biomass on all three substrata. Crayfish grazed selectively on macrophytes and reduced the biomass of Chara, whereas Elodea as less affected. The exotic signal crayfish had, overall, a stronger impact on the biomass of macrophytes and grazers than the native noble crayfish. The results indicate that crayfish may structure food webs through consumption from many food levels. The short-term influence of crayfish on other trophic levels depends on crayfish feeding efficiency. food preferences and species-specific consumption rates.																			0030-1299					JUN	1999	85	3					545	553		10.2307/3546704	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3546704													WOS:000080969400017

Rank correlation functions showed that fecundity and the rate of population increase in B. coregoni depended with a delay on the density of its population and on the biomass of edible phytoplankton (< 30 .mu.m). Birth rate and death rate of each of these species were delayed functions of density. Spatial niche overlap of the two Bosmina was high when food was abundant and low when food was scarce. The population dynamics of B. coregoni was identical in the lake and in a simultaneously developing laboratory culture in lake water. The observed midsummer decline in numbers of this species could not be explained by predators, the mechanical interference of net phytoplankton, temperature, and concomitant changes in edible phytoplankton and bacterial biomass. The reduction in density, which is also typical for Daphnia of other lakes, in B. coregoni is probably a result of a big time lag in the response of the rate of population increase. This delay begets population oscillations. In Lake Glubokoye higher values of the time lag for B. coregoni relative to B. longirostris were associated with higher competitive ability. The quantitative ratio of the two Bosmina species in the lake depends on competition between them.

While the early-Holocene rainfall records are available from lowland areas of the Indian sub-continent, the record is poorly documented from the high-altitude Central Himalayan region where orography plays an important role in the spatial variability in the rainfall pattern. For the first time, delta D-C29, delta C-13(C29) values of alkane and delta C-13 values of organic matter from a relict lake of Benital area in the Central Himalaya have been used to reconstruct monsoonal rainfall and contemporary vegetation for last 10.5 ka with an emphasis on the early Holocene. The delta D-C29 values suggest that the early Holocene was characterized by a wet phase at ca. 9 ka with 25% higher rainfall compared to present while the middle-late-Holocene was relatively arid. The estimated increase in monsoonal rainfall for the early Holocene is the highest compared to the previous report from elsewhere. The magnitude of early-Holocene rainfall estimated in this study suggests that in addition to erosion of the bed-rocks at the head-water region, increased stream power reworked the older floodplain and resulted in 2.3 times higher sediment discharged into the Ganges-Brahmaputra (GB) delta compared to the present discharge. The delta C-13(C29) values of the lake sediments suggest a transition from woody to non-woody plant assemblages occurred at 7 ka. The poor correlation between delta D-C29 and delta C-13(C29) values suggests at higher rainfall, the delta C-13(C29) values of catchment vegetation were less responsive.					; Roy, Sohom/IST-8197-2023; Sayed, Murtaza/AAI-4314-2021	Bhushan, Ravi/0000-0003-1347-5446; Ghosh, Sambit/0000-0002-6945-8285; ROY, SOHOM/0000-0002-1841-053X; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				JUL	2020	30	7					1063	1074	0959683620908639	10.1177/0959683620908639	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683620908639		APR 2020											WOS:000534054000001

The aim of this work is to evaluate whether the study of the isotope composition of carbon and nitrogen from collagen (delta C-13 and delta N-15) is a methodology that allows the discussion of hunting strategies - individual versus mass - carried out by human populations in this particular case of the guanaco from southern Patagonia. Samples come from five modern assemblages of guanacos located in the west margin of the Cardiel Lake and are the result of a catastrophic mortality episode produced by winter stress. The isotopic variability of these samples is compared with that of a mesoregional attritional assemblage built from multiple sites and chronologies. The results indicate, in the first place, that there is no differentiation between males and females, second, that the offspring show no increase of signals when compared to the other age categories and finally, juveniles recorded the lowest delta N-15 values. In relation to the main purpose of this research, measurements of variability from modern assemblages and the attritional groups have been compared. The three assemblages with lower variability are modern ones. However, the two remaining modern assemblages record a variability higher than or equal to the attritional groups. Thus, for southern Patagonian guanacos, the hypothesis that proposes that the isotopic variability of a herd would be lower than the one obtained from multiple populations and different hunting events is rejected. Finally, we analyze the possible causes for these results together with situations in which delta C-13 and delta N-15 can be used in the study of the guanaco hunting strategies in southern Patagonia.

The Palic Lake is a shallow lake typical for the Pannonian plain. The Lake itself was in a very bad condition during the late sixties of the last century; polluted and hypertrophic. Due to inadequate water quality, it was dried out in 1971 and re-established in 1977 and since then its trophicity has been worsening. The lake has recreational purposes but it is also a collector for treated municipal waste waters coming from the lagoons for active sludge water treatment. The sewage discharges from rapidly developing towns in the watershed and the growing use of fertilizers in agriculture increased the nutrient load to the Lake in the last decades. A steady increase of phosphorus loading is the most important factor of the lake eutrophication. The result of the accelerated eutrophication is the enormous amount of sediment at the bottom of the Palic Lake. Therefore, in the lake that covers an area of 565 ha and volume of 10 million m(3), there was 1.900.160 m(3) of sediment. The sediment thickness varied from 0.3 to 1.2 m. In summer 2010, the recreational part of the lake (sector IV) was 1.311.356 m(3) of sediment, characterized with concentrations of total phosphorus (TP) of 2885 mg/kg, 4300 mg/ kg total nitrogen (TN) and 39000 mg/ kg total organic carbon TOC. The sediment of the Palic Lake was not loaded with high concentrations of heavy metals. Everything mentioned supports the fact that the restoration of this aquatic system is necessary and applied measures have to be grounded on the principles of ecoremediation technologies.

Information on snow cover and snowmelt are important for understanding the timing and scale of many lake ecosystem processes. Field campaigns combined with data from airborne sensors and spaceborne high-resolution sensors have been used as reference data in experiments over many years. Several satellite sensors have been utilised in the development of new algorithms, including Terra MODIS and Envisat ASAR. The experiments have been motivated by operational prospects for snow hydrology, meteorology and climate monitoring by satellite-based remote sensing techniques. This has resulted in new time-series multi-sensor approaches for monitoring of snow cover area (SCA) and snow surface wetness (SSW). The idea was to analyse, on a daily basis, a time series of optical and radar satellite data in multi-sensor models. The SCA algorithm analyses each optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image individually and combines them into a day product based on a set of confidence functions. The SSW algorithm combines information about the development of the snow surface temperature and the snow grain size (SGS) in a time-series analysis. The snow cover algorithm is being evaluated for application in a global climate monitoring system for snow variables. The successful development of these algorithms has led to operational applications of snow monitoring in Norway and Sweden, as well as enabling the prediction of the spring snowmelt flood and thus the initiation of many lake production processes.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR	2010	642	1					35	46		10.1007/s10750-010-0157-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-010-0157-3													WOS:000275782400004

Termination II, Last Glacial Maximum, and Lateglacial chronologies and paleoclimate from Big Cottonwood Canyon, Wasatch Mountains, Utah	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												Late Pleistocene glaciers and lakes of the Great Basin have been studied extensively due to their excellent utility as paleoclimate proxies; such records are particularly useful where interpreted in combination. The Wasatch Range on the eastern edge of the Great Basin hosted extensive glaciers during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), in addition to Lake Bonneville, the region's largest pluvial lake. However, the timing of range-wide glaciation in the Wasatch remains uncertain as compared to the well-established Lake Bonneville chronology. Here we present new cosmogenic exposure ages from the Wasatch Range from low altitude striated bedrock (132.2 +/- 5.9 ka), lateral moraine (20.2 +/- 1.1 ka), nested moraines (15.5 +/- 0.8 ka), and high-altitude bedrock (14.8 +/- 0.7 ka) sites. These ages broadly reveal the local timing of Termination II, LGM, and Lateglacial stadia in the Wasatch, as well as subsequent deglaciation. We then use coupled glacier energy-mass balance and ice-flow models to reconstruct LGM and Lateglacial ice extents in order to determine paleoclimate conditions necessary to produce glacier extents and estimate LGM ice extents in a catchment lacking clear terminus features. Our results provide robust limits on the extents of late Pleistocene glaciers in three drainages of the central Wasatch Mountains and suggest that LGM glaciers reached and abandoned their maxima prior to the Bonneville highstand, while later undergoing rapid deglaciation coeval with the lake's fall from the Provo level. Combining modeled paleoclimate estimates with previously published pluvial lake reconstructions yields LGM temperature depressions ranging from -10 to -8 degrees C (with respect to modern) with 80-150% of modern precipitation, with a best matching Lateglacial temperature depression of -5 degrees C with 200% of modern precipitation. These results support the hypothesis of a relatively cold LGM climate in the Great Basin with little to no increase in precipitation, followed by a period of increased precipitation and warming coincident with Heinrich Stadial 1.					; Caffee, Marc/K-7025-2015	Moore, Jeffrey/0000-0001-5831-2048; Caffee, Marc/0000-0002-6846-8967													0016-7606	1943-2674				NOV-DEC	2018	130	11-12					1889	1902		10.1130/B31967.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/B31967.1													WOS:000449028300009

Sources of glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) in catchment soils, water column and sediments of Lake Rotsee (Switzerland) - Implications for the application of GDGT-based proxies for lakes	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												We analysed glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether (GDGT) distributions in the water column, sediment and catchment soils of the Swiss Lake Rotsee to determine the sources of GDGTs in the lake sediment and to determine the implications for GDGT-based palaeoclimate proxies. The branched GDGT (brGDGT) distribution in the soils surrounding the lake showed significant heterogeneity, which may be partly explained by vegetation cover and soil moisture. One group of soils seems to provide the largest contribution of soilderived GDGTs to the lake, or the distribution of GDGTs in these soils is affected by the relatively high soil moisture availability, creating lake-like conditions and GDGT distributions. Comparison of GDGT distributions in soils, water column and sediments indicated that brGDGTs and crenarchaeol in the sediment are partly soil derived, but that in situ production in the water column and/or sediment also takes place. Eutrophication seems to affect the distributions of brGDGTs by dilution of the supply of soil derived brGDGTs to the lake and by changing the degree of in situ production of brGDGTs in the water column. Furthermore, the eutrophic conditions in the lake promote methanogenic activity and subsequently cause a contribution of isoprenoid GDGTs (isoGDGTs) of methanogenic origin to the sediments. The aquatic production of GDGTs has implications for the reliability of GDGT-based proxy results. In particular, the application of the BIT and TEX86 indices is hampered by the mixed sources of the GDGTs in the lake. In contrast, global lake-specific brGDGT-based temperature calibrations resulted in temperature estimates that resemble measured mean annual and summer air temperatures. CBT-derived pH values agreed well with measured soil and water column values. Our results demonstrate that understanding the source of GDGTs in lake sediments is important for the robust interpretation of palaeoclimate records obtained from downcore proxy applications.

J	Russell, AJ; Knudsen, O				Russell, AJ; Knudsen, O			An ice-contact rhythmite (turbidite) succession deposited during the November 1996 catastrophic outburst flood (jokulhlaup), Skeioararjokull, Iceland	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												This paper presents new evidence of coarse-grained deposition from a turbulent suspension within a low-energy 'slack-water' location during a recent well-documented, volcanically related, high-magnitude glacier outburst flood or jokulhlaup, Skeioararjokull, Iceland. This study uses established spatial and temporal constraints on processes observed during the November 1996 jokulhlaup to interpret resultant flood sediments. Coarse-grained sediments were deposited within flood slack-water conditions from suspension load by repeated turbulent flow pulses with durations of seconds-minutes. Depositional processes are thought to be analogous to turbidity currents. A minimum thickness of 15 m of rhythmites record suspended sediment dynamics at a conduit mouth during the late rising and early falling stages of the jokulhlaup. The morphology and sedimentology of deposits in a large ice-wailed chamber are consistent with previous models proposed for bar deposition during cataclysmic floods. Flood flows within subglacial conduits and ice-walled open channels were sufficiently powerful to carry material up to boulder size in suspension. Macro-turbulent flows carried huge quantities of suspended sediment to high levels within the main outlet channel. High-frequency, short-duration flow pulses entering a complex ice-walled channel geometry generated highly unsteady and non-uniform flows capable of both erosional and depositional work. This study lends support to the deposition of multiple rhythmites per flood under main flow slack-water conditions. Identification of high-magnitude jokulhlaups in the ice-marginal sedimentary record will depend an the identification and correct interpretation of feeder channel and slack-water turbidite sediments. The results described here may also have application to rhythmic deposits formed by large turbulent flows in other environmental settings. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Paus, A; Svendsen, JI; Matiouchkov, A				Paus, A; Svendsen, JI; Matiouchkov, A			Late Weichselian (Valdaian) and Holocene vegetation and environmental history of the northern Timan Ridge, European Arctic Russia	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Lake and peat deposits from the Timan Ridge, Arctic Russia, were pollen analysed, reconstructing the vegetation history and paleoenvironment since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) 20-18,000 years ago. The sites studied are located inside the margins of a large paleolake of about 20 km(2), by us named Lake Timan. This lake developed in the Late Weichselian, more than 30,000 years after the deglaciation of this region, and was formed due to increased precipitation and warmer summers that accelerated the melting of stagnant ice within its catchment. The lake was drained during the early Holocene when the outlet rivers eroded the spillways. A new generation of much smaller lakes formed during the Holocene when the last remnants of buried glacier ice melted away causing the exposed floor of Lake Timan to subside. Since deglaciation, the following regional vegetation development has been recorded: (1) During the initial stage of Lake Timan, the dominant vegetation was discontinuous steppe/tundra, with patches of snow bed vegetation. (2) A dwarf-shrub tundra established during the Late Weichselian interstadial (Allerod), probably reflecting warmer and moister conditions. (3) The Younger Dryas cooling is recognised by a reversal to steppe/tundra and snowbeds on unstable mineral-soils, and higher palynological richness. (4) Soon after the transition into the Holocene, a birch-forest established on the Timan Ridge. (5) A cooling starting around 8200 cal. years BP initiated the deforestation of the exposed hills. In the most protected sites, birch trees persisted until later than 4000 years ago, reflecting a gradual development into the present treeless dwarf-shrub tundra. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

ANIMALS												Simple Summary In the non-growing season, beavers fell woody plants that they primarily use as a food source. It is well known that parameters such as woody plant availability, trunk diameter, and distance of woody plants from water influence food selection. Less information is available on the felling of specific species in different stand types where different forest management takes place. This makes the beaver a conflict species that causes damage to commercial forests, and information on foraging behavior in relation to environmental factors is very important. Especially as beaver populations continue to increase. In the three types of forest stands (monoculture, mixed forest, and natural forest), species selection, the intensity of felling, the distance of felled woody plants, and trunk diameter vary. The beaver, which generally prefers non-commercial tree species (willow, poplar, etc.), also adapts to and uses commercial oaks in commercial forests. These are most preferred at stand ages up to twenty years, i.e., smaller diameters but greater stand densities. The results suggest that by using knowledge of foraging behavior, economically profitable species can be protected by encouraging the non-commercial species most preferred by beaver (predominantly willow) near the shoreline. In addition, the natural tree composition around rivers or lakes will be promoted. Native ecosystems have been transformed by humans into cultural landscapes, resulting in the disruption of natural interactions, with some species unable to adapt and disappearing from such landscapes. Other species were able to adapt their behavior to current environmental conditions. In some places, forest management has gradually transformed native diversified forests into stands converted for the greatest profit in the wood matter, thereby affecting the food availability for herbivores, among them the Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber Linnaeus, 1758). This study summarizes knowledge on non-vegetation diet selection by beavers in commercial and natural forests in the Czech Republic. A sample size of 25,723 woody plant specimens checked in 288 forest stands showed that beavers prefer willow, poplar, or hazel, but where these are less available, commercial tree species such as oak may dominate the diet and cause economic losses in forestry. Significant differences were also observed in a preference for different trunk diameters and distances from water in different types of stands. In terms of stand types, commercial monocultures are the most felled, while the probability of felling decreases with the age of stands. Based on these results and discussion, it is suggested that commercial forest stands including economically valuable woody plant species (e.g., oak, ash) could be protected through appropriate management measures, such as increasing the proportion of deciduous softwood stands along the riverbanks, which would distract the beavers from commercial woody plant species.					; Drimaj, Jakub/O-7333-2014; Kamler, Jiří/B-9986-2014; Pyszko, Petr/AFS-9685-2022; Homolka, Miloslav/F-9649-2014; Plhal, Radim/B-9650-2014; Skoták, Vlastimil/ABZ-6388-2022	Pyszko, Petr/0000-0002-3743-7201; Kamler, Jiri/0000-0003-0664-6956; Skotak, Vlastimil/0000-0002-6342-4623; Plhal, Radim/0000-0002-3964-6496; Mikulka, Ondrej/0000-0002-5614-8667; Drimaj, Jakub/0000-0001-6363-9555													2076-2615					NOV	2022	12	21							2949	10.3390/ani12212949	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani12212949								36359073					WOS:000884108800001

Late Pleistocene-Holocene aeolian loess-paleosol sections in the Yellow River source area on the northeast Tibetan Plateau: chronostratigraphy, sediment provenance, and implications for paleoclimate reconstruction	CATENA												Two late Pleistocene-Holocene aeolian loess-paleosol sections were identified in the Yellow River source area on the northeast (NE) Tibetan Plateau. Based on the comprehensive study on multiple proxies, AMS C-14 and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dates, these two sections have a basal age of 14000-11500 yr BP, suggesting that they accumulated since the last deglaciation. Four stages of paleoclimate evolution can be summarized as follows. (1) A cold-dry period was dominated by the Westerlies in the late Pleistocene (ca. 14000-11500 yr BP). (2) A gradual transition to warm-wet with the weakened Westerlies and strengthened East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) occurred in the early Holocene (ca. 11500-9000 yr BP). (3) A warm-wet episode was under strong EASM in the middle Holocene (ca. 9000-3100 yr BP), however, a cold event was identified at 5000-3500 yr BP, which was caused by the abrupt weakening of the EASM and the strengthening of the Westerlies. (4) A phase of gradually shifting to dry-cold was controlled by the weakened EASM and strengthened Westerlies (after ca. 3100 yr BP). The assemblage of grain-size end-member modelling analysis (EM1-EM5) and heavy minerals indicated that aeolian deposit units have multiple sediment provenances and transport processes. EM1 is clay deposits composed of secondary clay minerals produced during weathering and pedogenesis, whereas EM2 is fine silts derived from distant dust transported through long-existing high-level Westerlies. EM3 and EM4 are coarse silts that originated from the moraines and periglacial deposits in the middle and distant source areas transported by the Westerlies and Tibetan Plateau Monsoon. Lastly, EM5 is sand from fluvial deposits and slope clastics transported by strong valley wind within the local area. This study is helpful to understand the mechanisms of paleoclimate evolution on the NE Tibetan Plateau. It also has important implications for characterizing and subdividing aeolian loess in China.

This model uses bioclimatic variables to predict the suitable climate-space for tree species. Current climate values were derived from weather records, and two general circulation models (CGCM1 and HadCM2) predicted future climate scenarios. Shifts in potential ranges that were predicted by the two climate models were similar in direction, but different in magnitude. Important timber trees with southern limits within the Great Lakes region, including white, jack, and red pine, aspen, and yellow birch are predicted to retreat northward under both scenarios due to increasing summer temperatures. Under CGCM1, these trees are predicted to disappear from most of the region by the end of the century, whereas under HadCM2 they are predicted to contract 100 to 200 km from their southern range limits. A number of broadleaf trees (red oak, sugar maple, and beech) are expected to remain in the region and may gain potential habitat to the west. Broadleaf trees with current northern range limits within the Great Lakes region (black walnut and black cherry) are predicted to gain potential habitat to the north due to increases in growing degree-days and coldest month temperatures. Both trees are predicted to be able to grow throughout the region by the end of the century under CGCM1, and a less dramatic gain is predicted under HadCM2.																			0380-1330						2002	28	4					555	567		10.1016/S0380-1330(02)70605-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(02)70605-9													WOS:000180411100006
B	Favis-Mortlock, D		Lal, R		Favis-Mortlock, David			Water Erosion	ENCYCLOPEDIA OF SOIL SCIENCE, VOLS I-III, 3RD EDITION												Erosion by water is the redistribution and removal of the upper layers of the soil, both by the action of falling rain and by water flowing over the soil during and after rain or following snow melt. It occurs on both agricultural and undeveloped landscapes. While erosion by water is a natural phenomenon, removal of the soil's protective cover of vegetation at times of heavy rains greatly increases erosion rates, so that they exceed rates of soil formation. This is known as accelerated erosion and is always the result of human actions such as unwise agricultural practices, overgrazing, or construction activity. Accelerated water erosion is a problem over much of the earth's surface and has both on-site and off-site impacts. The main on-site impact is the reduction in soil quality which results from the loss of the nutrient-rich upper layers of the soil and the reduced water-holding capacity of many eroded soils. In affluent areas of the world, accelerated water erosion's on-site effects upon agricultural soils can be mitigated by increased use of artificial fertilizers; however, this is not an option for much of the earth's population. Water erosion's main off-site effect is the movement of sediment and agricultural pollutants into watercourses, leading to the silting-up of dams, disruption of the ecosystems of lakes, and contamination of drinking water. In some cases, increased downstream flooding may also occur due to the reduced capacity of eroded soil to absorb water.

J	Madenjian, CP; DeSorcie, TJ; Stedman, RM				Madenjian, CP; DeSorcie, TJ; Stedman, RM			Maturity schedules of lake trout in Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We determined maturity schedules of male and female lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) in Lake Michigan from nearshore populations and from an offshore population on Sheboygan Reef, which is located in midlake. Gill nets and bottom trawls were used to catch lake trout in fall 1994 and 1995 from two nearshore sites and Sheboygan Reef. Each lake trout was judged immature or mature, based an visual examination of gonads. Probit analysis, coupled with relative potency testing, revealed that age-at-maturity and length-at-maturity were similar at the two nearshore sites, but that lake trout from the nearshore sites matured at a significantly earlier age than lake trout from Sheboygan Reef, However; length at maturity for the nearshore populations was nearly identical to that for the offshore population, suggesting that rate of lake trout maturation in Lake Michigan was governed by growth rather than age. Half of the lake trout males reached maturity at a total length of 580 mm, whereas half of the females were mature at a length of about 640 mm. Over half of nearshore males were mature by age 5, and over half the nearshore females matured by age 6. Due to a slower growth rate, maturity was delayed by 2 years on Sheboygan Reef compared with the nearshore populations. Documentation of this delay in maturation may be useful in deciding stocking allocations for lake trout rehabilitation in Lake Michigan.																			0380-1330						1998	24	2					404	410		10.1016/S0380-1330(98)70831-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(98)70831-7													WOS:000074588400023

Although their presence in the marine environment has been well-studied, much less data are available on their abundance in freshwaters. MPs alone and in combination with different chemicals has been shown to cause acute and chronic effects on algae and aquatic invertebrate and vertebrate species at different biological levels. However, the combined ecotoxicological effects of MPs with different chemicals on aquatic organisms are still understudied in many species and the reported data are often controversial. In the present study, we investigated, for the first time, the presence of MPs in Lake Balaton, which is the largest shallow lake of Central Europe and an important summer holiday destination. Moreover, we exposed neonates of the well-established ecotoxicological model organism Daphnia magna to different MPs (polystyrene [3 mu m] or polyethylene [<= 100 mu m]) alone and in combination with three progestogen compounds (progesterone, drospirenone, levonorgestrel) at an environmentally relevant concentration (10 ng L-1) for 21 days. The presence of 7 polymer types of MPs in the size range of 50-100 mu m was detected in Lake Balaton. Similarly to the global trends, polypropylene and polyethylene MPs were the most common types of polymer. The calculated polymer-independent average particle number was 5.5 particles m-3 (size range: 50 mu m - 100 mu m) which represents the values detected in other European lakes. Our ecotoxicological experiments confirmed that MPs and progestogens can affect D. magna at the behavioral (body size and reproduction) and biochemical (detoxification-related enzyme activity) levels.

Sedimentary DNA records long-term changes in a lake bacterial community in response to varying nutrient availability	ENVIRONMENTAL DNA												Microbial communities play important roles in lake ecosystems and are sensitive to environmental change. However, our understanding of their responses to long-term change such as eutrophication is limited, as long-term lake monitoring is rare, and traditional paleolimnological techniques (pigments and microfossils) are restricted to a low taxonomic resolution, or organisms with well-preserved structures. Sedimentary DNA (sedDNA) is a promising technique to reconstruct past microbial communities in sediments, but taphonomic processes and the ability of sedDNA to record bacterial pelagic history accurately are largely unknown. Here, we sequenced the 16S rRNA gene in triplicate sediment cores from Esthwaite Water (English Lake District) which has concurrent long-term monitoring and observational data. The sediment record spanned 113 years and included an episode of increased nutrient availability from the 1970s, followed by a more recent decline. Trends in bacterial community composition were broadly similar among the three sediment cores. Cyanobacterial richness in the sediment cores correlated significantly with that of cyanobacteria in a 65-year microscopy-based monitoring record, and some known pelagic bacterial taxa were detected in the sediment. sedDNA revealed distinct shifts in community composition in response to changing lake physicochemical conditions. The relative abundance of cyanobacteria closely reflected nutrient enrichment, and Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Verrucomicrobia were relatively more abundant in recent sediments, while Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, Acidobacteria, Nitrospirae, Spirochaetes, and Planctomycetes declined in more recent sediments. Following lake restoration efforts to reduce nutrient enrichment, the relative abundance of cyanobacteria returned to pre-1970 levels, but the bacterial community did not fully recover from the period of intense eutrophication within the time scale of our study. These results suggest that sedDNA is a valuable approach to reconstruct lake microbial community composition over the 100-year time scale studied, but an improved understanding of DNA deposition and degradation is required to further the application of sedDNA in paleolimnology.					; Read, Daniel/B-5446-2008; Maberly, Stephen/J-3361-2012; Thackeray, Stephen/D-2415-2013; Thorpe, Amy/HNR-7078-2023	Thorpe, Amy/0000-0003-0210-2767; Read, Daniel/0000-0001-8546-5154; Thackeray, Stephen/0000-0003-3274-2706; 													2637-4943					NOV	2022	4	6					1340	1355		10.1002/edn3.344	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/edn3.344													WOS:001302748500010

As such, their physiology, ecology, and evolutionary history remain unknown. The 16S rRNA gene survey reveals that Sumerlaeota is frequently detected in diverse environments globally, especially cold arid desert soils and deep-sea basin surface sediments, where it is one dominant microbial group. Here, we retrieved four Sumerlaeota metagenomeassembled genomes (MAGs) from two hot springs and one saline lake. Including another 12 publicly available MAGs, they represent six of the nine putative Sumerlaeota subgroups/orders, as indicated by 16S rRNA gene-based phylogeny. These elusive organisms likely obtain carbon mainly through utilization of refractory organics (e.g., chitin and cellulose) and proteinaceous compounds, suggesting that Sumerlaeota act as scavengers in nature. The presence of key bidirectional enzymes involved in acetate and hydrogen metabolisms in these MAGs suggests that they are acetogenic bacteria capable of both the production and consumption of hydrogen. The capabilities of dissimilatory nitrate and sulfate reduction, nitrogen fixation, phosphate solubilization, and organic phosphorus mineralization may confer these heterotrophs great advantages to thrive under diverse harsh conditions. Ancestral state reconstruction indicated that Sumerlaeota originated from chemotrophic and facultatively anaerobic ancestors, and their smaller and variably sized genomes evolved along dynamic pathways from a sizeable common ancestor (2,342 genes), leading to their physiological divergence. Notably, large gene gain and larger loss events occurred at the branch to the last common ancestor of the order subgroup 1, likely due to niche expansion and population size effects. IMPORTANCE In recent years, the tree of life has expanded substantially. Despite this, many abundant yet uncultivated microbial groups remain to be explored. The candidate phylum Sumerlaeota is widely distributed in various harsh environments. However, their physiology, adaptation mechanisms, and evolution remain elusive due to a lack of pure cultures and limited available genomes. Here, we used genomes from uncultivated members of Sumerlaeota to disclose why these taxa can thrive under diverse harsh conditions and how they evolved from a chemotrophic and facultatively anaerobic common ancestor. This study deeply explored the biology of Sumerlaeota and provided novel insights into their possible roles in global biogeochemical cycles, adaptation mechanisms, ecological significance, and evolutionary history.

Dispersion of vendace eggs and larvae around potential nursery areas reveals their reproductive strategy	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Depending on their reproductive strategy, different fish species aim to aggregate or disperse eggs and larvae in their reproductive habitat. Many pelagic species disperse their eggs widely around the potential nursery areas. Larval dispersion or aggregation affects population sub-structuring, which has important implications in fisheries management and conservation of the natural spatial diversity in populations. The dispersion of larval vendace (Coregonus albula) was quantified in two oligotrophic Finnish lakes, and effects of density and environmental variables on the inter-annual variation in the larval distribution were examined by analysing spatial abundance data from the lakes from 1999 to 2017. A 3-D hydrodynamic egg distribution model was used to simulate the larval transport after hatching. Vendace larvae dispersed lake-wide to both littoral and pelagic zones but, in some littoral hot spots, more larvae aggregated year after year. However, in years of high larval number, the densities increased not only in the hot spots, but generally at all sampling plots. An overall increase in abundance was observed at all sampling sites. The simulations of the egg distribution model supported the hypothesis that the dispersion of the eggs occurs by spawners, i.e. by spawning at several different spawning sites, which are located all around the lake. The dispersion of vendace eggs and larvae can be seen as a bet-hedging strategy in space and time since in boreal oligotrophic large lakes with fragmented morphology, weather and other environmental factors in spring during hatching varies from year to year spatially in unpredictable manner. Lake-wide larval dispersion suggests that the subpopulations of adjacent lake deeps may swap considerable amounts of individuals during early life and may not be closed units. Conservation of particular habitats seems unnecessary for Finnish vendace populations where large potential spawning areas in lakes are available.					; Karjalainen, Juha/B-4079-2015; Juntunen, Janne/B-9892-2015	Koljonen, Saija/0000-0002-8324-5673; Karjalainen, Juha/0000-0001-9302-1174; Marjomaki, Timo J./0000-0002-0563-3099; Juntunen, Janne/0000-0001-5593-3850													0046-5070	1365-2427				MAY	2019	64	5					843	855		10.1111/fwb.13267	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.13267													WOS:000466805700003
J	Hill, CA; Polyak, VJ				Hill, Carol A.; Polyak, Victor J.			A karst hydrology model for the geomorphic evolution of Grand Canyon, Arizona, USA	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												The evolution of Grand Canyon started similar to 85 Ma when the southwestern Hualapai Plateau section of the Colorado Plateau began uplifting. This uplift initiated a northeast-trending drainage/canyon system ("Laramide paleo-Grand Canyon") that was to constrain all later routes, including that of the Colorado River. This drainage proceeded down dip but up the stratigraphic section so that northward incision intersected progressively younger Paleozoic to Mesozoic rock. We propose a capture of groundwater by the karstic Redwall Limestone at RM 197 that shifted the drainage direction of this early canyon along a N60 degrees E-trending section to RM 130. Uplift of the Kaibab arch at similar to 80-65 Ma forced Coconino Plateau drainage to divert around the west side of the arch rather than northeast across it. In the Mid-Tertiary an "Arizona River" in the western Grand Canyon transported Shinumo clasts to the California Sespe Formation, and a magmatism-tectonic-volcanism episode occurred on and south of the Hualapai Plateau. By similar to 17 Ma, Basin and Range down-faulting furthered earlier Miocene canyon headward erosion eastward and then northward into Utah, causing a complete regional drainage reversal southward; this "Miocene western paleo-Grand Canyon" river incised into the Redwall-Muav karst aquifer so as to supply the 12-6 Ma Hualapai Limestone with high Sr-87/Sr-86 carbonate spring water. A similar to 6.0-5.5 Ma "final connection" between the east and west sides of the Kaibab arch was accomplished by karst-piracy drainage traversing under the arch. This complexity of origin - separate canyon sections joined, drainage reversals, and a final karst connection - is why Grand Canyon remains enigmatic to geologists.																			0012-8252	1872-6828				SEP	2020	208								103279	10.1016/j.earscirev.2020.103279	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2020.103279													WOS:000575845800001
J	Ding, YQ; Sun, LM; Qin, BQ; Wu, TF; Shen, X; Wang, YP				Ding, Yanqing; Sun, Limin; Qin, Boqiang; Wu, Tingfeng; Shen, Xia; Wang, Yongping			Characteristics of sediment resuspension in Lake Taihu, China: A wave flume study	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Lake Taihu is a typical shallow lake which frequently happens sediment resuspension induced by wind-induced waves. The experiments are carried on to simulate the wave disturbance processes in wave flume by setting a series of wave periods (1.2 s, 1.5 s, 1.8 s) and wave heights (2 cm, 10 cm). It aims to analyze the characteristics of sediment resuspension and the mechanisms of nutrients release and to evaluate the effects of sediment dredging on sediment resuspension and nutrients release in Lake Taihu. The results show that wave shear stress during 2 cm and 10 cm wave height processes ranges 0.018-0.023 N/m(2) and 0.221-0.307 N/m(2), respectively. Wave shear stress has no significant differences between wave periods. Wave height has much more effects on sediment resuspension. Wave height of 2 cm could induce total suspended solids (TSS) reaching up to 5.21 g/m(2) and resuspension flux of sediment (M) up to 1.74 g/m(2). TSS sharply increases to 30.33-52.41 g/m(2) and M reached up to 48.94 g/m(2) when wave height reaches to 10 cm. The disturbance depth under different sediment bulk weights ranges from 0.089 to 0.161 mm. Variation of suspended solids in 3 layers (1 cm, 5 cm, 20 cm above sediment interface) has no significant differences. Organic matter, TN and TP have positive relationship with SS. Organic matter is only accounted for 5.7%-7.3% of SS. The experiments under different sediment bulk densities (1.34 g/cm(3), 1.47 g/cm(3) and 1.59 g/cm(3)) find that TSS and M fall by 44.2% and 39.8% with sediment bulk density increasing, respectively. Total TN, DTN, TP and DTP decrease by 24.3%-33.6%. It indicates that sediment dredging could effectively reduce SS concentration and nutrient levels in water column. The researches provide a theoretical basis for sediment dredging to control the shore zone of Lake Taihu for lake management.

Terrestrial laserscanning and unmanned aerial vehicles provide very high resolution data with high accuracy. Automatic cameras have become a valuable source of information-mostly in a qualitative manner-in recent years. The availability of satellite data with very high revisiting time has gained momentum through the European Space Agency's Sentinel missions, offering new application potential for Earth observation. This paper reviews the status of recent techniques such as terrestrial laserscanning, remote sensed imagery, and synthetic aperture radar in monitoring high mountain environments with a particular focus on the impact of new platforms such as Sentinel-1 and -2 as well as unmanned aerial vehicles. The study area comprises the high mountain glacial environment at the Pasterze Glacier, Austria. The area is characterized by a highly dynamic geomorphological evolution and by being subject to intensive scientific research as well as long-term monitoring. We primarily evaluate landform classification and process characterization for: (i) the proglacial lake; (ii) icebergs; (iii) the glacier river; (iv) valley-bottom processes; (v) slope processes; and (vi) rock wall processes. We focus on assessing the potential of every single method both in spatial and temporal resolution in characterizing different geomorphic processes. Examples of the individual techniques are evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively in the context of: (i) morphometric analysis; (ii) applicability in high alpine regions; and (iii) comparability of the methods among themselves. The final frame of this article includes considerations on scale dependent process detectability and characterization potentials of these Earth observation methods, along with strengths and limitations in applying these methods in high alpine regions.

Spatial trends and possible sources of organic composition	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												The chemistry of river-lake systems located in Central Mongolia near the southern border of permafrost occurrence has not been well studied. The main aim of this paper is to summarize patterns in water chemistry in supply springs, rivers and lakes in relation to permafrost occurrence, as well as other natural and anthropogenic impacts. The analyses involved water samples taken from two river-lake systems: the Baydrag River-Boon Tsagaan Lake system and the ShargalyuutjTuyn Rivers-Orog Lake system. Total organic carbon (TOC) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were detected and quantified. Other organic compounds, such as organic halogen compounds, phthalates, and higher alkanes were also noted. The main factors which influence differences in TOC concentrations in the water bodies involve permafrost occurrence, mainly because compounds are released during active layer degradation (in the upper reach of the Tuyn river), and by intensive livestock farming in river valleys and in the vicinity of lakes. In relation to the concentrations of PAHs, high variability between samples (>300 ng L-1), indicates the influence of thermal water and local geology structures ( e.g., volcanic and sedimentary deposits), as well as accumulation of suspended matter in lakes transported during rapid surface runoff events. The monitoring of TOC as well as individual PAHs is particularly important to future environmental studies, as they may potentially reflect the degradation of the environment. Therefore, monitoring in the Valley of the Lakes should be continued, particularly in the light of the anticipated permafrost degradation in the 21st century, in order to collect more data and be able to anticipate the response of river-lake water chemistry to changes in permafrost occurrence.

Review of indexing tools for identifying high risk areas of phosphorus loss in Nordic catchments	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Compliance with the Water Framework Directive (WFD) will require substantial reductions in agricultural phosphorus (P) losses in the Nordic countries Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland. Falling P surpluses in agriculture for more than a decade and voluntary programmes of good agricultural practice have not reduced P losses to surface waters, while general. regulatory measures have primarily focused on nitrogen. Without addressing the role of critical source areas for P loss, policy measures to abate diffuse P losses are likely to be ineffective. This has created a demand by environmental authorities for instruments that assess the risk of P losses from agricultural land and facilitate the planning of mitigation measures. In Nordic countries index-type risk assessment tools for diffuse P tosses are under development inspired by experiences with P indexing in the USA. A common feature is that they are empirical, risk-based, user-friendly decision toots with tow data requirements. Phosphorus indices vary between the four Nordic countries in response to different agriculture, soil and climate. These differences also result in different recent average annual agricultural P toad estimates to the sea of 0.3, 0.5, 0.5 and 1.1 kg total P ha(-1) in Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland, respectively. In initial evaluations, Nordic P indices explained a large degree of variance in P losses at the field or catchment scale, but comparative data are still limited. To gain acceptance amongst stakeholders and inform river basin management planning in Nordic catchments as part of the WFD, it is crucial to more thoroughly evaluate the performance of these indices' at the field and catchment scale.

J	Maizels, J				Maizels, J			Jokulhlaup deposits in proglacial areas	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												This paper discusses the main causes and characteristics of jokulhlaup ('glacier burst') floods, and explores the extent to which they generate depositional landform and sediment assemblages that are distinct from those of 'normal', braided river outwash ('Type I' outwash). Two main jokulhlaup outwash environments are identified: Type II outwash, produced by sudden drainage of ice-dammed lakes; and Type III, associated with drainage during subglacial geothermal activity, and distinguished by deposits resulting from high sediment concentrations and hyperconcentrated flows. In fluid flows, especially ones yielding Type II outwash, the most common deposits are large-scale expansion bars (and locally, eddy and pendant bars), and 'mega-ripples' or dunes, both forms normally composed of large-scale gravel-cobble cross-bedding, often capped by an imbricated boulder lag (a 'Type B2' lithofacies sequence). The armour is absent only where runoff decreased too rapidly to allow surface winnowing. Other jokulhlaup facies include extensive boulder beds (Type C), inverse-normally graded cobble beds (Type D5), ice-proximal debris flow deposits and deformed bedding containing diamicton clasts (Types G and H), and slack-water sediments (Type A). Type III outwash is dominated by massive, homogeneous, flood surge granules, underlain by pre-surge gravels, and capped by post-surge fluid bedforms, reflecting deposition during both the rising and falling Limbs of the flood hydrograph (Type E4). The paper demonstrates that jokulhlaups do generate distinctive assemblages of depositional landforms and sediments, and concludes with a model of the dominant lithofacies sequences and associated landforms in proglacial environments subject to jokulhlaup drainage.

Research and monitoring activities were expanded in 1991 by the U.S. Geological Survey Water, Energy, and Biogeochemical Budgets program to understand the processes, and their interactions, controlling water, energy, and biogeochemical fluxes. With help from many collaborators we have characterized trends and patterns in atmospheric deposition, climate, and hydrology, including glaciers and other ice features. Instead of acidic deposition, we documented high atmospheric inputs of reactive nitrogen (Nr), and have studied the ecological consequences in soils, surface water, and vegetation. Using paleolimnology, we documented the onset of human-caused change to lake primary producers ca. 1950 in response to increased Nr deposition and warming. Our results provided the basis for the Colorado Nitrogen Deposition Reduction Plan, a state policy that aims to reduce Nr emissions to protect resources in RMNP by 2032. Carbon cycle research revealed mountain wetlands now release more carbon than they store, and respiration and methane flux occurs even during winter through deep snow packs. Trend analyses found export of Nr to be closely tied to atmospheric inputs, but can lag in response to drought. Current research explores consequences of the combination of warming, changes in precipitation dynamics, and atmospheric deposition of Nr and dust on stream and lake CO2 dynamics, lake biology and trophic state, and soil carbon composition. Dramatic increases in park visitors have prompted studies on the effects of recreational use on water quality. New tools such as remote sensing and high frequency instream water quality sensors are being applied to lake and stream studies. Monitoring, combined with experiments, models, and spatial comparisons is an essential foundation for science-based resource management.					; Oleksy, Isabella/AAD-2249-2021	Clow, David/0000-0001-6183-4824; Oleksy, Isabella/0000-0003-2572-5457; Weinmann, Tim/0000-0003-1502-5254													0885-6087	1099-1085				MAR	2021	35	3							e14107	10.1002/hyp.14107	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.14107													WOS:000636346700040

Boreal chorus frogs (Pseudacris triseriata maculata) and Canadian toads (Bufo hemiophrys) were common but found at less than half of the study sites. All 3 spp. had spawned prior to 12 June. Natural ponds and borrow pits were the most frequently used spawning sites. Canadian toads also spawned in flowing water and lake margins. All species had metamorphosed by early Aug. Wood frogs metamorphosed at a mean snount-vent length of 17.2 mm, Canadian toads at 12.4 mm, and boreal chorus frogs at 13.7 mm. Spawning for each of these species probably does not occur until individuals are in their 3rd summer of life. Population densities of wood frogs, boreal chorus frogs and Canadian toads reached estimated maxima of 19.6, 2.3 and 12/1000 m2 during 1977. Maximum densities of all species were found within 50 m of the nearest water body in moist habitat vegetated by sedges, grasses, horsetails, willows, and poplar. Lower densities were found in upland mixed woods and no anurans were found in dry areas with sandy substrate and Jack Pine forest. Other amphibian and reptile species were not encountered.																			0008-3550						1979	93	2					144	154																WOS:A1979GV21500006
J	Piper, WH; Tischler, KB; Reinke, A				Piper, Walter H.; Tischler, Keren B.; Reinke, Andrew			Common Loons respond adaptively to a black fly that reduces nesting success	AUK												Nesting birds must often cope with harassment from biting insects, but it is difficult to ascertain what effect such pests might have on breeding success and population dynamics. We tested the hypothesis that a black fly (Simulium annulus) that feeds on the blood of nesting Common Loons (Gavia immer) causes nest abandonment in this charismatic diving bird. In addition, we measured effects of fly-induced abandonment on a loon population, and examined potential predictors of fly abundance and nest abandonment. We also tested a second hypothesis, which holds that loon pairs that abandon a nest owing to flies should often remain at the site for their subsequent nesting attempt, since fly outbreaks last only 1-2 weeks. All predictions of the fly-induced abandonment hypothesis were supported, including strong correlations between fly counts and rate of abandonment, reduced incubation during severe fly years, and increased abandonment during cool springs, which promote longevity of the flies. The correlation between nest abandonment and population breeding success suggests that S. annulus reduced the chick fledging rate by as much as 23% in a year of severe infestation. Fly numbers on loons and their nests were highest when temperatures were high and winds were light. Surprisingly, however, exposure to the prevailing wind increased, not decreased, nest abandonment, perhaps because of wave action. Lake size was inversely and female age directly correlated with abandonment rate, possibly due to food limitation in small lakes and senescence of females, respectively. Finally, pairs that abandoned a first nest renested at the same site with much greater frequency than did pairs that lost eggs to a predator, indicating that loons are capable of responding adaptively to a cause of nest failure that is time- but not space-dependent.																			0004-8038	1938-4254				JUL	2018	135	3					788	797		10.1642/AUK-17-239.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1642/AUK-17-239.1													WOS:000436501100031

Patterns of invertebrate density and taxonomic richness across gradients of area, isolation, and vegetation diversity in a lake-island system	ECOGRAPHY												Over the past half century, ecologists have tried to unravel the factors that drive species richness patterns in ecological communities. One influential theory is island biogeography theory (IBT), which predicts that island or habitat area and isolation are drivers of species richness. However, relatively few studies testing IBT have considered invertebrate or belowground communities, and it is unclear as to whether the predictions made by IBT hold for these communities. Other theories predict that habitat characteristics such as vegetation diversity may be important drivers of invertebrate species richness. To investigate patterns of invertebrate density and species richness across gradients of area, isolation, and vegetation diversity, we used a system of 30 lake islands in the boreal zone of northern Sweden. We assessed density and taxonomic richness of ground-dwelling spiders, web-building spiders, beetles, collembolans, mites, and nematodes, for all islands during two consecutive summers. For all invertebrate groups, both density and taxonomic richness were either neutrally or negatively related to island size, and either neutrally or positively related to island isolation. Meanwhile the density and taxonomic richness for several groups was positively related to vegetation diversity (i.e. habitat heterogeneity). In multiple regression analyses, island size was often the single best predictor for both invertebrate density and taxonomic richness, but in some cases island size and isolation in combination explained more variation than each factor considered singly. Contrary to IBT predictions, invertebrate density and richness was never positively related to island size or negatively related to island isolation. Instead, our results suggest that plant diversity (and thus habitat heterogeneity) was the main driver of the patterns that we found, although other factors could have some influence. We conclude that several factors, but not necessarily those predicted as important by IBT, are important in determining invertebrate abundance and species richness in island systems.

Erosional modification and gully formation at Meteor Crater, Arizona: Insights into crater degradation processes on Mars	ICARUS												Hydrogeological modification of Meteor Crater produced a spectacular set of gullies throughout the interior wall in response to rainwater precipitation, snow melting, and possible groundwater discharge. The crater wall has an exceptionally well-developed centripetal drainage pattern consisting of individual alcoves, channels, and fans. Some of the gullies originate from the rim crest and others from the middle crater wall where a lithologic transition occurs; broad gullies occur along the crater corner radial faults. Deeply incised alcoves are well developed on the soft Coconino Sandstone exposed on the middle crater wall, beneath overlying dolomite. In general, the gully locations are along crater wall radial fractures and faults, which are favorable locales of erosion due to preferential rock breakup from faulting, and groundwater flow/discharge; these structural discontinuities are also the locales where the surface runoff from rain precipitation and snow melting can preferentially flow, causing erosion and crater degradation. Channels are well developed on the talus deposits and alluvial fans on the periphery of the crater floor. Caves exposed on the lower crater level point to percolation of surface runoff and selective discharge through fractures on the crater wall. In addition, lake sediments on the crater floor provide significant evidence of a past pluvial climate, when the water table was higher, and groundwater may have seeped from springs on the crater wall. Although these hydrological processes continue at Meteor Crater today, conditions at the crater are much more arid than they were soon after impact, reflecting a climatic shift. This climate shift and the hydrological modifications observed at Meteor Crater provide insights for landscape sculpturing on Mars during various parts of its history. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

J	WOELKERLING, WJ				WOELKERLING, WJ			WISCONSIN DESMIDS .1. AUFWUCHS AND PLANKTON COMMUNITIES OF SELECTED ACID BOGS, ALKALINE BOGS, AND CLOSED BOGS	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Data are presented for 28 acid bogs, 5 alkaline bogs and 12 closed bogs in Wisconsin [USA] with respect to the summer composition of the aufwuchs and plankton communities, the relative importance of desmids in these communities, and the structure of aufwuchs communities associated with different macrophyte hosts. Generic diversity of desmids is highest in acid bogs and lowest in alkaline bogs and generally is greater in the aufwuchs community than in the plankton community at a given site. Whenever it was present, the greatest diversity occurred in association with the macrophyte host Utricularia. Among lakes of a given type, relationships between the occurrence of desmid genera and parameters of the chemical environment were not apparent for either the aufwuchs or plankton communities. Similarly, no clear-cut distinctions occur in the desmid communities of the 3 lake types in terms of population densities and percentage contribution to the total population, but acid bogs tend to have a somewhat more prominent flora quantitatively. Statistically significant differences in desmid population densities from one host to another within a given lake did occur in lakes of all 3 types; this suggests that the nature of the substrate can definitely influence community size and composition. Data for other algal groups are similarly treated, and brief comparisons of the mat and open water communities of alkaline bogs are included.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1976	48	3					209	232		10.1007/BF00028693	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00028693													WOS:A1976BQ48500004

Using a combination of time-series analysis of population counts recorded over 16 Sears and experimental data, we present the first estimates of the relative roles of top-down and bottom-up forces on the population dynamics of two terrestrial insect herbivores on the English oak (Quercus robur). Data suggest that temporal variation in winter moth, Operophtera brumata, density is dominated by time-lagged effects of pupal predators, By comparison, spatial variation in O. brumata density is dominated by host-plant quality. Overall, top-down forces explain 34.2% of population variance, bottom-up forces explain 17.2% of population variance, and 48.6% remains unexplained. In contrast, populations of the green oak tortrix, Tortrix viridana, appear dominated by bottom-up forces, Re: source limitation, expressed as intraspecific competition among larvae for oak leaves, explains 29.4% of population variance. Host quality effects explain an additional 5.7% of population variance, Wc detected no major top-down effects on T. viridana populations. An unknown factor causing a linear decline in T. viridana populations over the 16-year study period accounts for most of the remaining unexplained variance, We discuss the observed differences between the insect species and the utility of time-series analysis as a tool in assessing the relative importance of top-down and bottom-up forces on herbivore populations.

Here, we aimed to estimate the relative strength of bottom-up and top-down trophic interactions between water quality and fish community composition using a comparative approach. Our main hypothesis was that lakes with an abundant piscivore (mainly pikeperch, Sander lucioperca, Percidae) stock would have better water quality than similar lakes with a poor piscivore stock. We used structural equation models on biomass catch per unit of effort data from standard gillnet test fishing to examine the effects of predators (pikeperch, pike [Esox lucius, Esocidae] and piscivorous perch [Perca fluviatilis, Percidae]) on cyprinids (Cyprinidae), and the effects of cyprinids, nutrients, and lake depth on water quality measured as chlorophyll-a concentration and turbidity. We derived the dataset covering a single summer snapshot of 138 Finnish pikeperch lakes from national databases. Nutrients and lake depth index, the main principal component describing positive effects of nutrient concentrations and negative effects of lake depth, had a positive effect on chlorophyll-a concentration and turbidity. Pikeperch had a detectable negative effect on both planktivorous and benthivorous cyprinids. While pike also had a negative effect on benthivorous cyprinids, both groups of cyprinids had a positive effect on pikeperch and pike. Supporting the strong, fish-independent bottom-up regulation, no significant relationships were detected between the cyprinids and water quality. This study suggests that the bottom-up effects override the top-down effects, and despite pikeperch is an efficient piscivore, the observed stock levels did not cascade down to improved water quality. Thus, in lake restoration, reductions of nutrient loading appear more efficient than biomanipulation aimed to strengthen the top-down links.

Genetic evidence for canal-mediated dispersal of Mapleleaf, Quadrula quadrula (Bivalvia: Unionidae) on the Niagara Peninsula, Canada	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Alterations to watercourses affect connectivity in aquatic systems and can influence dispersal of aquatic biota. Dams fragment populations and act as isolating barriers, but canals create connections between waterbodies that can be used as corridors for dispersal by opportunistic invaders. The Niagara Peninsula of Ontario, Canada, has a 200-y history of canal operation, resulting in major modification of the watercourses in the region. This modification allowed numerous invasive species to enter the upper Great Lakes (e. g., sea lamprey) and probably has facilitated dispersal in native species. The purpose of our study was to explore the effects of canal and dam construction on the genetic structure of Mapleleaf (Quadrula quadrula), a widespread and relatively common species in the central Great Lakes that has been found only recently in several western Lake Ontario harbors. Establishment of Q. quadrula in Lake Ontario may have been a recent event, facilitated by the Niagara Peninsula's history of canal operation. We used analyses of microsatellite DNA genotypes to examine the effect of canals on the genetic structure of mussel populations. Structure analysis revealed a pattern of gene flow between lakes that cannot be explained by watercourse connections prior to the creation of the Welland Canal. Evidence suggestive of historical bottlenecks at some Lake Ontario sites may indicate that these populations became established after canal creation. After considering genetic structure, hydrogeography and isolation-by-distance (IBD) analysis, the first iteration of the canal (1829-1833) is most supported as the configuration that facilitated colonization. However, weak IBD signals across canal models may signify continued gene flow across configurations. Our study demonstrates the connective effect of canals on freshwater mussel populations and has the potential to improve conservation strategies for this and other unionid species at risk.					; Zanatta, David/AAR-6797-2020; Morris, Todd/G-4868-2012	Zanatta, David/0000-0002-3174-071X; 													2161-9549	2161-9565				MAR	2018	37	1					82	95		10.1086/696127	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/696127													WOS:000425176000008

Spatial and temporal distribution of juvenile Gulf Sturgeon in the Pearl River, Louisiana, and adjacent estuaries of the Gulf of Mexico	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Objective: Acoustic telemetry was used to examine the spatial-temporal distribution and anadromous migration pattern of juvenile Gulf Sturgeon Acipenser desotoi within the Pearl River and associated coastal estuaries of Louisiana and Mississippi. Methods: Acoustic transmitters were surgically implanted in 52 juvenile Gulf Sturgeon (<890 mm fork length) from the Pearl River between 2016 and 2019. Sturgeon were monitored on 247 acoustic receivers in the lower Pearl River and adjacent estuaries across numerous partnering arrays. Result: Juveniles were detected on receivers from Lake Pontchartrain, Louisiana, east to Bay St. Louis, and Biloxi Bay, Mississippi. The 3-year study found that juvenile Gulf Sturgeon migration in the Pearl River occurred on cycles similar to those reported from other populations. Juveniles were rarely observed in the estuary and nearshore marine environments from May through mid-October of each year, during which time most sturgeon inhabited the Pearl River. Conversely, most of the juveniles inhabited coastal estuaries from December through February of each year and were rarely observed in freshwater environments during this period. Migration from the river into the estuary occurred during late-October through November, and migration from the estuary into the river occurred in March and April. Distribution patterns varied spatially within the river and estuary ecosystems during each phase of migration. Tagged juveniles occupied the lowest 40 km of the Pearl River while in freshwater, and they occupied the northeastern shoreline of Lake Pontchartrain and Bay St. Louis while in the estuary. Interestingly, juveniles seemed to target specific areas in the estuary during winter that were farther away from the mouth of natal rivers than has been previously reported. Conclusion: This study provides a new assessment of juvenile Gulf Sturgeon migration and seasonal distribution for the Pearl River and provides important information for designing and assessing the potential benefits and challenges of habitat restoration for Gulf Sturgeon.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				JUN	2024	44	3					551	571		10.1002/nafm.10984	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.10984		APR 2024											WOS:001207819900001

Two headwater lakes with little excess He in bottom water have sediment He concentration profiles indicating slow (2-7 cm a-1) recharge of lake water to groundwater. Data from three lakes showing He enrichment in bottom water indicate groundwater seepage at some sites. Sediment He gradients in headwater Lake 239 were usually weak, although a strong gradient was found at one site. Probes located within suspected seepage areas in Lake 239 indicated groundwater discharge velocities of 3-22 cm a-1. Fifth order Lake 240 had a He gradient suggesting groundwater seepage at 11-17 cm a-1. Eighth-order Lake 625, a lineament basin with high He concentrations in bottom water, had very strong He gradients in sediment. One probe indicated diffusive He transport through sediment, whereas another indicated seepage at 3-6 cm a-1. Direct He fluxes to the lakes, estimated from its accumulation in bottom water during summer stratification, are in reasonable agreement with fluxes calculated independently from the He gradients in sediment. Measurements of natural He gradients in lake sediment give a sensitive and reliable indication of the direction and rate of groundwater transport at velocities of 1-100 cm a-1.																			0022-1694	1879-2707				FEB	1994	154	1-4					63	84		10.1016/0022-1694(94)90212-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-1694(94)90212-7													WOS:A1994MZ15700004

There was great concern on post-fire erosion and water quality hazards to Sydney's drinking water supply, especially after the heavy rainfall events in February 2020. We developed a rapid and innovative approach to estimate post-fire hillslope erosion using weather radar, remote sensing, Google Earth Engine (GEE), Geographical Information Systems (GIS), and the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). The event-based rainfall erosivity was estimated from radar-derived rainfall accumulations for all storm events after the wildfires. Satellite data including Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were used to estimate the fractional vegetation covers and the RUSLE cover-management factor. The study reveals that the average post-fire erosion rate over SDWC in February 2020 was 4.9 Mg ha(-1) month(-1), about 30 times higher than the pre-fire erosion and 10 times higher than the average erosion rate at the same period because of the intense storm events and rainfall erosivity with a return period over 40 years. The high post-fire erosion risk areas (up to 23.8 Mg ha(-1) month(-1)) were at sub-catchments near Warragamba Dam which forms Lake Burragorang and supplies drinking water to more than four million people in Sydney. These findings assist in the timely assessment of post-fire erosion and water quality risks and help develop cost-effective fire incident management and mitigation actions for such an area with both significant ecological and drinking water assets. The methodology developed from this study is potentially applicable elsewhere for similar studies as the input datasets (satellite and radar data) and computing platforms (GEE, GIS) are available and accessible worldwide.					; zhang, mingxi/GYI-9562-2022; yang, xihua/AAD-9855-2022	Yang, Xihua/0000-0002-5990-2186; Roff, Adam/0000-0002-0457-8251; zhang, mingxi/0000-0002-5431-9274; 														2072-4292				NOV	2020	12	22							3805	10.3390/rs12223805	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12223805													WOS:000594551000001

Effects of low levels of ultraviolet radiation on antioxidant mechanisms of Japanese Medaka (Oryzias latipes)	CHEMOSPHERE												Extreme weather events like drought are expected to increase with climate change, which will increase exposure of freshwater fish to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Compared to fully grown adult fish, fish in early life stages are more susceptible to UV radiation due to the lack of well-developed pigmentation. Even though several studies have described affectation of fish health after exposure to UV radiation, most of the studies have used intensities that are only found on the surface of the earth crust or at shallow depths in water bodies, and little is known about impacts of weaker UV radiation, which can be found in deep water. This study showed effects on the antioxidant system of Japanese Medaka after 7 days of exposure to very low intensities of UV radiation, levels that can be found at deep locations in lakes and rivers. Exposure to UV radiation (UVA: 360.1 +/- 18.4 mu W cm(-2) for a dose of 21.6 +/- 1.2 mJ cm(-2) min(-1), and UVB: 6.3 +/- 0.5 mu W cm(-2) for a dose of 0.38 0.03 mJ cm(-2) min(-1)) caused a reduction in the catalase activity (over 50%) and enhanced oxidative damage to lipids. Results of this study showed that environmentally relevant, low levels of UV radiation affect mechanisms by which fish deal with enhanced production of reactive oxygen species and oxidative damage. The results raise concerns about early life stages of fish under scenarios of increased exposure to solar light, such as in tropic regions or during summer in temperate regions.

Improvements in water quality following biomanipulation of gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) in Lake Denham, Florida. Lake Reserv Manage. 27: 287-297. We removed gizzard shad (GS; Dorosoma cepedianum) from Lake Denham, a 104 ha hypereutrophic lake in the Ocklawaha chain of lakes in central Florida, to evaluate biomanipulation for restoration of shallow hypereutrophic Florida lakes. A commercial haul seine removed GS in winters 1990, 1991, and 1992. The 3-year total removal was 51,738 kg wet weight or 498 kg/ha, which reduced the stock of harvestable adult GS to less than 3% of the initial level. Water quality in Lake Denham improved progressively during the biomanipulation, and some improvements persisted through 2007 despite removal of a fish barrier in 1993. From 1989 until 1993, mean annual Secchi disk visibility in Lake Denham increased from 23 to 57 cm, mean annual chlorophyll a decreased from 143 to 40 ug/L, and mean annual total phosphorus declined from 194 to 93 ug/L. Neither land use nor rainfall changed significantly during the experiment, and similar improvements were not evident in other basin lakes during the same period. These findings and work elsewhere support our conclusion that removal of GS can be an effective component in the restoration of shallow hypereutrophic lakes. We postulate that the improvements were associated with reduced nutrient cycling and bioturbation rather than increased zooplankton predation on phytoplankton. Long-term improvements in water quality in Lake Denham indicate that effects of biomanipulation can persist when the benthivorous fish populations remain depressed.																			1040-2381	2151-5530					2011	27	4					287	297		10.1080/07438141.2011.609633	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438141.2011.609633													WOS:000299477500001

We analysed stable hydrogen, nitrogen and carbon isotope ratios in feather keratin to determine whether these vary among breeding populations, and whether feathers can be used to infer migratory connections between breeding and non-breeding areas. Blue Swallows from the three major breeding populations differed significantly in terms of their feather delta D and delta N-15 values [South Africa/Swaziland: delta D = -25.1 +/- A 6.7aEuro degrees Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW), delta N-15 = 10.4 +/- A 1.0aEuro degrees atmospheric nitrogen (AIR); Zimbabwe: delta D = -59.9 +/- A 7.5aEuro degrees VSMOW, delta N-15 = 10.1 +/- A 0.6aEuro degrees AIR; Malawi/Tanzania: delta D = -43.2 +/- A 10.8aEuro degrees VSMOW, delta N-15 = 11.7 +/- A 1.3aEuro degrees AIR], but not in terms of feather delta C-13. We also analysed feathers from seven individuals caught in the non-breeding range on the shores of Lake Victoria in Uganda. A discriminant function analysis assigned four of these birds to the South Africa/Swaziland breeding population and two to the Malawi/Tanzania breeding population (P > 0.997), with the remaining individual not being unambiguously assigned. Our results reveal that migratory connections in this threatened species can be inferred from feather stable isotope analysis, and that there is overlap in the wintering ranges of at least two of the three major breeding populations.

J	Liao, Q; Li, T; Wang, QY; Liu, DR				Liao, Qiang; Li, Tong; Wang, Qiyou; Liu, Deer			Exploring the ecosystem services bundles and influencing drivers at different scales in southern Jiangxi, China	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Located in the hilly and mountainous central area of the national ecological security strategic pattern (described as "two ecological barriers and three green belts"), southern Jiangxi is an important ecological barrier in southeast China and a pilot area for the national mountains-rivers-forests-farmlands-lakes-grasslands restoration projects. In recent years, the rapid economic development of the southern Jiangxi region and the rapid changes in land use, agricultural intensification, and population urbanization have severely tested this ecosystem on which people depend for their survival. Currently, studies of ecosystems and their interactions from a single spatial perspective have sprung up, but only a few studies have comprehensively analyzed different spatial scales to facilitate the sustainable development of regional ecosystems. Multi-scale studies should be carried out to quantitatively understand the relationship between ecosystem services (ESs) and socio-natural drivers, in an attempt to find a suitable scale to assess regional ESs or to achieve complementary advantages by combining multi-scales so as to conduct hierarchical management of ESs. Therefore, to better understand the interplay between ESs and to achieve the goals of sustainable development, we quantitatively analyzed the evolutionary patterns, trade-offs, and synergies of ESs. In our analysis, we also looked at bundling ESs and their drivers for seven ecosystem services at the township and watershed scales for 2000-2020 in southern Jiangxi. Crop production, meat production, water yield, carbon storage, soil retention, habitat quality, and forest recreation services were specifically quantified, and redundancy analysis was used to explore the influence degree of precipitation, temperature, elevation, slope, GDP, and population density on ESs. The results showed that most ESs have increased in southern Jiangxi, indicating spatial and temporal heterogeneity. The scale effect of tradeoff and synergy showed that the spatial variation was similar, but the amplitude of variation was different. Compared with the watershed scale, the overall bundle of ESs in southern Jiangxi is better identified and clustered at the township scale. In addition, Cluster 4 at the township scale and Cluster 3 at the watershed scale can comprehensively identify high-value areas of ecosystem services in the study area. The rapid growth of GDP and population density caused by rapid urbanization were the main driving factors of the difference in ESs between the two scales in southern Jiangxi. Our results provide recommendations for governance and restoration of regional ecosystem services and support for conducting a comprehensive analysis of spatio-temporal evolutionary mechanisms and interactions of ecosystem services at different scales.

Long-term trends of water chemistry in mountain streams in Sweden - slow recovery from acidification	BIOGEOSCIENCES												The water chemistry of streams and precipitation in the province of Jamtland, northern Sweden has been monitored since the 1980s to study long-term trends, occurrence of acid episodes, and effects of liming. The acidity in precipitation increased in the 1970s, followed by a loss of acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) and low pH in the streams. Sulfur deposition began to decrease in the 1980s, until approximately 2000, after which the decrease levelled out. Stream water sulfate concentration followed the precipitation trend but decreased more slowly and since the late 1990s a subtle increase was observed. Sulfate concentrations in the snow typically have been higher than or equal to the stream sulfate levels. However, during the period of rapid deposition decrease and also since 2005 stream sulfate has sometimes exceeded snow sulfate, indicating desorption of stored soil sulfate, possibly because of climate-related changes in runoff routes through the soil profiles, following shorter periods of frost. From 1982 to 2000, total organic carbon (TOC) increased by approximately 0.1 mg L-1 yr(-1). The mean trends in sulfate and TOC from approximately 1990 until today were generally opposite. Acidic episodes with pH 4.0 at flow peaks occurred frequently in the unlimed streams, despite relatively well-buffered waters at baseflow. To evaluate the main causes for the loss of ANC during episodes, the changes in major ion concentrations during high flow episodes were evaluated. The most important factors contributing to ANC loss were dilution of base cations (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+), enrichment of organic anions and enrichment of sulfate. Wetland liming started in 1985 after which the earlier observed extreme peak values of iron, manganese and aluminium, did not reoccur. The studied area is remote from emission sources in Europe, but the critical load of acidity is still exceeded. The long-term recovery observed in the unlimed streams is thus slow, and severe acidic episodes still occur.																			1726-4170	1726-4189					2014	11	1					173	184		10.5194/bg-11-173-2014	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-11-173-2014													WOS:000329930700012

M.; Park, Young-Seuk			Characterization of Ecological Exergy Based on Benthic Macroinvertebrates in Lotic Ecosystems	ENTROPY												The evaluation of ecosystem health is a fundamental process for conducting effective ecosystem management. Ecological exergy is used primarily to summarize the complex dynamics of lotic ecosystems. In this study, we characterized the functional aspects of lotic ecosystems based on the exergy and specific exergy from headwaters to downstream regions in the river's dimensions (i.e., river width and depth) and in parallel with the nutrient gradient. Data were extracted from the Ecologische Karakterisering van Oppervlaktewateren in Overijssel (EKOO) database, consisting of 249 lotic study sites (including springs, upper, middle and lower courses) and 690 species. Exergy values were calculated based on trophic groups (carnivores, detritivores, detriti-herbivores, herbivores and omnivores) of benthic macroinvertebrate communities. A Self-Organizing Map (SOM) was applied to characterize the different benthic macroinvertebrate communities in the lotic ecosystem, and the Random Forest model was used to predict the exergy and specific exergy based on environmental variables. The SOM classified the sampling sites into four clusters representing differences in the longitudinal distribution along the river, as well as along nutrient gradients. Exergy tended to increase with stream size, and specific exergy was lowest at sites with a high nutrient load. The Random Forest model results indicated that river width was the most important predictor of exergy followed by dissolved oxygen, ammonium and river depth. Orthophosphate was the most significant predictor for estimating specific exergy followed by nitrate and total phosphate. Exergy and specific exergy exhibited different responses to various environmental conditions. This result suggests that the combination of exergy and specific exergy, as complementary indicators, can be used reliably to evaluate the health condition of a lotic ecosystem.					; Park, Youngseuk/D-6462-2013	Park, Young-Seuk/0000-0001-7025-8945; Verdonschot, Piet/0000-0002-4126-7452														1099-4300				JUN	2013	15	6					2319	2339		10.3390/e15062319	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/e15062319													WOS:000320773000018

Despite our lack of sufficient experimental verification and the momentary absence of a valid mechanism to explain its occurrence, even-MIF could be instrumental in understanding the cycle and deposition of atmospheric Hg. In contrast to slightly positive delta 200Hg values (< 0.30 parts per thousand) frequently observed in most atmospheric samples, large & UDelta;200Hg values (up to 1.24 parts per thousand) determined in precipitation from Peterborough (Ontario, Canada) stand out and could provide valuable information for the origin of the even-MIF mystery. We now report a systematic analysis of high-resolution rainfall and snowfall samples collected in winter during cold weather at Peterborough, Canada. Dissolved and particulate Hg both displayed large variations of odd-MIF (from -0.93 parts per thousand to 2.02 parts per thousand; for & UDelta;199Hg), which may result from long-range transportation, as the negative odd-MIF in particulate Hg is likely a result of long-distance transport of arctic atmospheric Hg(II). Dissolved Hg revealed significant even-MIF values (from 0.25 parts per thousand to 1.19 parts per thousand for delta 200Hg) and a negative relationship between delta 200Hg and & UDelta;204Hg, which provide further evidence for the previously proposed conceptual model of delta 200Hg. Disconnected odd-MIF and even-MIF trends were detected in sequentially collected precipitation samples, which further suggests different sources or mechanisms for delta 199Hg and delta 200Hg. Particularly, the high delta 200Hg values highlight the transport of stratospheric Hg through a polar vortex to the sampling region, stimulating further systematic investigation. The new delta 200Hg data for particulate Hg add to existing information on atmospheric Hg(II) worldwide, suggesting a global distribution of Hg characterized by even-MIF in the atmosphere, and further constrain the model of atmospheric Hg deposition.

Elodea mediates juvenile salmon growth by altering physical structure in freshwater habitats	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Invasive species introductions in high latitudes are accelerating and elevating the need to address questions of their effects on Subarctic and Arctic ecosystems. As a driver of ecosystem function, submerged aquatic vegetation is one of the most deleterious biological invasions to aquatic food webs. The aquatic plant Elodea spp. has potential to be a widespread invader to Arctic and Subarctic ecosystems and is already established in 19 waterbodies in Alaska, USA. Elodea spp. has been found to alter ecosystem processes through multiple pathways; yet little is known about the impact of Elodea spp. on fish life history. A primary concern is the effect of Elodea spp. on juvenile Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), because this invading plant can form dense stands in littoral zones, potentially impacting important freshwater rearing habitats used by juvenile fish for foraging and refuge from predators. We used a field experiment to test the effect of Elodea spp. on juvenile coho salmon (O. kisutch) growth in an infested lake near Cordova, Alaska, USA. We found that Elodea spp. stands result in reduced growth and a lower trophic position for juvenile coho salmon over the summer compared to habitats dominated by a native assemblage of aquatic plants. While infested sites were not associated with significant changes in water condition or primary productivity compared to sites dominated by native vegetation, zooplankton densities were reduced, and Elodea spp. height and vegetation richness increased macroinvertebrate densities. Combined, these results indicate that Elodea spp. may alter the flow of energy to juvenile salmon by restructuring space and affecting prey resources for rearing fish. Furthermore, these results suggest that widespread establishment of Elodea spp. may alter the quality of habitat for juvenile salmon and, by affecting juvenile fish growth, could lead to population-level impacts on salmon returns.

Predicting tacrolimus concentrations in children receiving a heart transplant using a population pharmacokinetic model	BMJ PAEDIATRICS OPEN												Objective Immunosuppressant therapy plays a pivotal role in transplant success and longevity. Tacrolimus, a primary immunosuppressive agent, is well known to exhibit significant pharmacological interpatient and intrapatient variability. This variability necessitates the collection of serial trough concentrations to ensure that the drug remains within therapeutic range. The objective of this study was to build a population pharmacokinetic (PK) model and use it to determine the minimum number of trough samples needed to guide the prediction of an individual's future concentrations. Design, setting and patients Retrospective data from 48 children who received tacrolimus as inpatients at Primary Children's Hospital in Salt Lake City, Utah were included in the study. Data were collected within the first 6 weeks after heart transplant. Outcome measures Data analysis used population PK modelling techniques in NONMEM. Predictive ability of the model was determined using median prediction error (MPE, a measure of bias) and median absolute prediction error (MAPE, a measure of accuracy). Of the 48 children in the study, 30 were used in the model building dataset, and 18 in the model validation dataset. Results Concentrations ranged between 1.5 and 37.7 mu g/L across all collected data, with only 40% of those concentrations falling within the targeted concentration range (12 to 16 mu g/L). The final population PK model contained the impact of age (on volume), creatinine clearance (on elimination rate) and fluconazole use (on elimination rate) as covariates. Our analysis demonstrated that as few as three concentrations could be used to predict future concentrations, with negligible bias (MPE (95% CI)=0.10% (-2.9% to 3.7%)) and good accuracy (MAPE (95% CI)=24.1% (19.7% to 27.7%)). Conclusions The use of PK in dose guidance has the potential to provide significant benefits to clinical care, including dose optimisation during the early stages of therapy, and the potential to limit the need for frequent drug monitoring.					; Stockmann, Chris/P-1996-2014; Kumar, Shaun/P-4680-2017; Sherwin, Catherine/B-2888-2012	Rower, Joseph/0000-0003-3629-7902; Sherwin, Catherine/0000-0002-0844-3207														2399-9772				OCT	2017	1	1							e000147	10.1136/bmjpo-2017-000147	http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjpo-2017-000147								29177199					WOS:000642294400007

During this period the area was significantly affected by changes in sea level, climate and vegetation, resulting in a dynamic and complex environmental history, however little research has concentrated on environmental change and human impacts during the last few millennia. This study focuses on this late period, presenting the results of integrated sedimentary, microfossil and radiocarbon analyses from a core near the eastern margin of Lake Dianshan, to the east of Taihu. After the withdrawal of intertidal conditions and the conversion to freshwater lake at the core site about 2600 cal. yr BP, pollen and algal spore data show that increased sedimentation gradually reduced freshwater depth until a surface peat formed ca. 1500 cal. yr BP. This also dates the start of a switch in woodlands from sub-tropical and warm temperate trees to a mainly cool temperate and coniferous tree flora, under climatic cooling and human impact. After this time water depths at the site increased greatly, partly due to climate change and flooding, but also because of the establishment of deepwater 'paddy' agriculture. Microcharcoal and pollen data show that a major episode of human impact using fire, with deforestation and rice cultivation, occurred between ca. 1500 and 1200 cal. yr BP. These dates suggest it is one of the latest examples of 'flooded-field"paddy' cultivation before more intensive agricultural techniques were adopted in the area after ca. 800 cal. yr BP.

J	Moreno-Ostos, E; Paracuellos, M; Blanco, JM				Moreno-Ostos, Enrique; Paracuellos, Mariano; Maria Blanco, Jose			The position of the Gulf Stream influences waterbird brood numbers in a Mediterranean wetland (Albuferas de Adra, Spain)	LIMNETICA												Wetlands constitute complex ecosystems where different stable states alternate through catastrophic regime shifts. It is known that the inter-annual variation in the spring weather conditions constitutes a key factor for catastrophic shifts between phytoplankton-dominated turbid states and clear water phases in Albuferas de Adra, a Mediterranean coastal wetland. In previous studies we demonstrated that this alternation of equilibrium states has an effect on waterbirds, which show higher abundance and brood production in years characterised by the occurrence of clear water phases. In this paper we examine the teleconnection between the Gulf Stream position, a large-scale oscillating phenomena influencing weather conditions in West Europe, the weather variability in Albuferas de Adra and waterbird brood numbers in such an ecosystem. Our results suggest that when the Gulf Stream moves towards the south unstable meteorological conditions prevail in the region, favouring the productivity of waterbirds within the wetland through the occurrence of clear water phases. By contrast, northern displacements of the oceanic current are associated with stable weather, turbid water phases and lower numbers of broods. The Gulf Stream position significantly influenced the reproduction of the specialist coots, grebes and diving ducks, while no relation with the generalist and ubiquitous dabbling ducks was found. Potential implications for wetland management and waterfowl conservation are noted.					; Moreno-Ostos, Enrique/R-6782-2019	Moreno Ostos, Enrique/0000-0001-9471-3922; 													0213-8409	1989-1806				DEC	2014	33	2					237	248																WOS:000347145300003

Modern influences on chironomid distribution in western Ireland: potential for palaeoenvironmental reconstruction	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Ireland provides a unique setting for the study of past climates, as its climate is dominated by westerly airflow from the North Atlantic and readily responsive to changes in North Atlantic circulation patterns. Although there has been substantial research on Ireland's past environments, quantitative palaeolimnological research, especially chironomid-based research, has been lacking. In order to further develop chironomid-based palaeolimnological investigations, a calibration set was constructed to determine the dominant environmental controls on modern chironomids in western Ireland. Chironomid subfossils were collected from surface sediments of 50 lakes. The lakes were characterised with 36 environmental variables, including physical attributes, lake water characteristics, lake sediment characteristics and land cover within each catchment. In this exploratory study, no specific environmental variable was targeted and lakes were chosen to span gradients of latitude, elevation, depth and trophic status. Redundancy analysis showed that six environmental variables-mean July air temperature, lake depth, dissolved organic carbon, and percentage catchment land cover of agriculture, peat bog and scrubland-captured a large and statistically significant portion of the variance in the chironomid data. July temperature and agricultural land cover were the most dominant environmental variables, with July temperature proving the most suitable for inference model development. A classical weighted-averaging model was developed to estimate July air temperature, with a coefficient of determination (r (jack) (2) ) of 0.60 and root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 0.57 A degrees C. Results suggest that summer temperature is the dominant influence on chironomid distribution across a wide variety of lake types, and the relatively small RMSEP should allow for more accurate reconstructions of Ireland's relatively subdued Holocene temperature fluctuations.

J	Rougé, C; Cai, XM				Rouge, Charles; Cai, Ximing			Crossing-scale hydrological impacts of urbanization and climate variability in the Greater Chicago Area	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												This paper uses past hydrological records in Northeastern Illinois to disentangle the combined effects of urban development and climatic variability at different spatial scales in the Greater Chicago Area. A step increase in annual precipitation occurred in Northeastern Illinois during 1965-1972 according to climate records. Urbanization has occurred as a gradual process over the entire Greater Chicago Area, both before and after the abrupt annual precipitation increase. The analysis of streamflow trends at each gaging station is supplemented by the comparison of the evolution of streamflow indicators in a group of urban and agricultural watersheds, thanks to an original use of the Mann-Whitney test. Results suggest that urban expansion in the Greater Chicago Area has led to widespread increases in a wide variety of streamflow metrics, with the exceptions being spring flows and some of the peak flow indicators. The increases detected in small (<100 km(2)) urban watersheds are mitigated in large (>200 km(2)) ones, over which the changes in streamflow are relatively homogeneous. While the impacts of land-use change are identified across a wide range of flow indicators and spatial scales, there are indications that some of these effects are mitigated or made negligible by other factors. For example, while impervious surfaces are found to increase flooding, stormwater management facilities, an adaptation to increased flooding, mitigate their impacts at a wide range of scales. While impervious surfaces are known to reduce infiltration and baseflow, a low flow increase was triggered by water withdrawals from Lake Michigan, as a response to a rising water demand which made on-site groundwater extraction unsustainable. Our analysis thus highlights the impacts of adaptive planning and management of water resources on urban hydrology. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Jin, ZD; Wu, YH; Zhang, XH; Wang, SM				Jin, ZD; Wu, YH; Zhang, XH; Wang, SM			Role of late glacial to mid-Holocene climate in catchment weathering in the central Tibetan Plateau	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												The lightness (L*) and concentrations of Rb, Sr and organic carbon (C-org) have been measured in the age-constrained lake sediment cores recovered from Co Ngoin in the central Tibetan Plateau. Dissolved Sr flux is a dominant control on the variation of Rb/Sr ratios in the sediments. Variations in color and geochemical proxies of Co Ngoin sediments display a continuous history of late glacial to mid-Holocene chemical versus physical weathering intensity in response to past climatic changes between approximately 13,500 and 4500 cal yr B.P. A lower chemical weathering under a late glacial climate was followed by a higher weathering during the Holocene Optimum. Weathering intensity in the central Tibetan Plateau catchment also responds to well-known climatic events, such as the Younger Dryas (YD), and possibly the Holocene Event 5 (HE-5). Although there are differences in time or duration of the climatic events, many of the well-known late glacial to mid-Holocene events occurred in high-elevation Co Ngoin where atmospheric circulation might play a hemispherical role in climatic forcing. The sediment hiatus since c. 4200 C-14 yr B.P. in the Co Ngoin indicates a period of desiccation that was probably associated with a sharp decrease in summer monsoon strength. Our lascustrine results not only imply catchment weathering variations in response to late glacial to mid-Holocene climatic conditions in the central plateau, but also provide further evidence for global connections between regional climates.

Outbreak-related cases occurred in 79 persons including 3 secondary cases in campers. Campylobacter jejuni was isolated from stool specimens from 16 of 21 patients who submitted a sample; 13 viable isolates were serotyped and all were serotype O:33 (somatic O scheme) or HL:18 (heat-labile scheme), and biotype III (Lior scheme). This serotype is widely distributed geographically but rarely isolated from humans, Samples of water from the wells supplying the camp were negative for faecal coliforms, and raw milk had not been served in the camp. A matched (1:1)case-control study identified tuna salad served for lunch on 19 July as the likely food item associated with illness (matched odds ratio = 22; 95 % confidence intervals (CI) = 3.6-908). Swimming in the camp pool and other recreational water use in area lakes by the campers were not statistically associated with illness. The precise mechanism of introduction of the organism into the tuna salad remains unknown; contamination most likely occurred through cross-contamination with another food product, the hands of a food handler, or a work surface. Several deficiencies in the operation of the camp kitchen were identified. In Wisconsin, kitchens of such camps are subject to different inspection rules than restaurants. Camp staff, administrators, counselors, food managers, and infirmary staff, should fulfil important roles in their respective areas to prevent future outbreaks.

Letizia; Carlino, Pasquale; di Lascio, Antonella; Rossi, David			Autochthonous and allochthonous plant contributions to coastal benthic detritus deposits: a dual-stable isotope study in a volcanic lake	AQUATIC SCIENCES												The high numbers of primary producers represent multiple sources of organic matter accumulating onto lake bottoms. The difficulty of distinguishing the relative contribution to the mixture presents considerable challenges to the analysis of these organic deposits. In this study, dual-stable isotope analysis and IsoSource model were used to identify allochthonous and autochthonous components of detritus deposits (Particulate Organic Matter: POM) at two different bottom slope sites of a volcanic lake (lake Bracciano). Experiments were carried out to calibrate IsoSource on constructed plant mixtures and assess changes in isotope ratios during plant decomposition. IsoSource satisfactorily discriminated the constructed mixture sources with a few exceptions. Changes in isotopic enrichment during decomposition were low, and thus did not represent a confounding variable in the isotopic analysis. By contrast, chemical and geological differences of the study sites were associated with differences in plant delta C-13 and delta N-15 values (more than 2aEuro degrees within single plant species). At both sites, the isotopic signals of POM fell between polygons delineated by source end members with an evident shift of delta C-13 toward allochthonous sources. POM amount and diversity were greater at the flatter bottom site, where allochthonous contributions were larger than at the other site. In particular, IsoSource ranked species contributions as follows: A. glutinosa > P. australis > A. donax > S. alba > P. nigra > the benthic macroalga Chara sp. at the first site, and A. glutinosa > P. nigra > the aquatic macrophyte C. demersum at the latter. The composition of littoral POM was determined by allochthonous sources in proportion to their relative abundances (as percent land cover) with differences between sites due to bottom slope.					; Rossi, David/L-1665-2019	Rossi, David/0000-0002-9089-3257; Costantini, Maria Letizia/0000-0001-6242-558X; ROSSI, LORETO/0000-0001-8014-5397													1015-1621	1420-9055				MAR	2010	72	2					227	236		10.1007/s00027-009-0125-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-009-0125-z													WOS:000274707200007

This study aims to investigate the variation in the absorption coefficients of TSM and CDOM of inland waters. A total of 92 water samples were collected from Shitoukoumen Reservoir and Songhua Lake in Northeast China, analyzed for TSM and Chl-a, and measured for the absorption coefficient of TSM, CDOM and total pigments using a laboratory spectrophotometer. The absorption coefficient of TSM has been decomposed for phytoplankton and inorganic sediments. The results show that for Shitoukoumen Reservoir, CDOM has strong absorptions with shallow absorption slopes (i.e., the coefficient S in a(lambda)=a(lambda(0))exp[-S(lambda- lambda(0))]) and large absorption at 355 nm; and for Songhua Lake, CDOM follows similar spectral absorption curves but less variation in the S value. The results also show TSM has the average absorption coefficient 5.7 m(-1) at 440 nm and 0.93 m(-1) at 675 nm, and their concentration is well correlated to TSM with R-2 larger than 0.85 at 440 nm over both Songhu Lake and Shitoukoumen Reservoir. In summer, CDOM was mainly terrigenous and had a high proportion of humic acid derived from the decomposition of phytoplankton and there were no obvious difference of S value. The results indicate that inorganic sediments contributed much more absorption than phytoplankton pigments in Shitoukoumen Reservoir than that in Songhua Lake, and there is strong association of TSM concentration to absorption coefficient at 440 nm.

(63.degree. N in the central Canadian arctic), showed that the lakes were P limited but required both P and N for increased production. Photosynthetic response to 0.1 g P and 1.0 g N .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. yr-1 was immediate (15 .fwdarw. 30 g C .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. yr-1), with simultaneous increases in protozoa, while oligotrophic chrysophyte assemblages gave way to volvocalean greens. Cyanophytes were not important during P-only or P and N additions or in oligotrophic lakes, but formed permanent blooms in several naturally mesotrophic lakes near sea level. Retention of P was naturally low, but high during P addition. Silicon (Si) retention was always very high. Chlorophyll:P ratios were similar to those of subarctic and north-temperate lakes. Saturation light intensity (Ik) tracked surface eight flux with a 2- to 3-wk delay, averaging 15 E .cntdot. m-2.cntdot.s-1 in winter and peaking at 140 E.cntdot.m-2.cntdot.s-1 in July. Comparison of our data with those for lakes in the Experimental Lakes area (northwestern Ontario, 50.degree. N) and Char Lake (75.degree. N) shows that with increasing latitude, in small lakes, (a) phytoplankton production decreases, (b) phytoplankton production per unit light decreases less sharply, and (c) and (c) the proportion of primary production occurring beneath ice cover increases.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				JAN	1989	46	1					90	107		10.1139/f89-013	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f89-013													WOS:A1989R865800013

It is not clear if the dormant state in notostracans is controlled endogenously (diapause) or exogenously (quiescence). For Lepidurus arcticus, it is unknown how it responds to the photoperiod entrainment, if it has a biological clock and if it has a rhythmic expression of the clock genes. We studied the hatching success of resting eggs at four constant temperatures (5, 10, 15 and 25 degrees C) and under different illumination regimes [continuous light (LL) and continuous dark (DD)]. It was assumed that light and temperature are both important triggers, with temperature having the most pronounced effect. In our experiment, hatching occurred only at 5 and 10 degrees C, while we did not observe hatching at 15 and 25 degrees C. The highest percentage of eggs hatched was at 10 degrees C in LL (60%); the lowest was at 5 degrees C in DD (18%). The percentages hatched at 5 degrees C in LL (24%) and at 10 degrees C in DD (26%) were similar. Our results indicate that both temperature and light had a significant and interacting effect on hatching in L. arcticus, with temperature being the dominant factor controlling the process. This suggests that changes in temperature affecting the Arctic may significantly impact phenology of this key species in the region. Given that no hatching was observed at 15 degrees C or above, the persistence of this species may be at risk in areas were arctic lakes are expected to warm to such levels during the summer months.

They are characterized by coarse lithic breccias with a pumiceous matrix. The proximal coarse lithic breccias are divided into the lower massive unit and the upper stratified unit. The lower massive lithic breccias tend to transform laterally into tuff breccias and pumiceous lapilli tuffs. Paleomagnetic results showed that all of the deposits were deposited at high temperatures of 175-560 degrees C. This was also supported by geological characteristics such as spatter clasts, dasts with a bread-crust texture, and weakly welded parts. These features clearly show that the deposits originated from pyroclastic density currents (PDCs). The dense lithic-rich lithofacies, low vesicularity of pumice, lack of plinian fall deposits, and radial distribution indicate that the deposits were derived from boil-over PDCs rather than plinian column-collapse PDCs. The SiO2 contents of the matrix glasses of the proximal lower massive breccia showed a progressive decrease from the bottom toward the upper part. We interpret that this chemical variation corresponds to chemical zonation of the magma chamber. This indicates that the massive deposits aggraded progressively from the base upwards (progressive aggradation), rather than through en masse freezing. The vertical lithofacies changes of the proximal breccias from the lower massive to the upper stratified units indicate that a sustained current in a quasi-steady state switched to an unsteady current with the progression of the volcanic activity.

Objective.-We designed this study to determine the incidence and risk factors for AMS in trekkers around Mount Damavand in Iran. Methods.-Symptoms of AMS and the contributing factors were assessed in the course of 6 weeks in summer 2000. Standard Lake Louise questionnaires were administered to 459 subjects, all of whom were trekkers. The questionnaires were filled out in 3 steps, first at 2900 in and then during both ascent and descent at 4200 m. Results.-The overall incidence of AMS was 60.8%. The incidence was higher in residents who lived at an altitude less than 600 in, amateur trekkers, those with a previous history of AMS, those with a history of AMS at ascent to Damavand, and those with night ascents (6 Pm to midnight). Incidence was weakly dependent on rate of ascent (from 2900 m up to 4200 in in less than 4 hours) and sleep at 4200 in. No significant association was found between AMS and sex, age, body mass index, height, weight, smoking, weight of knapsacks, or the spent time in the shelter (at 4200 in). Conclusions.-We conclude that the incidence of AMS is high in Iranian trekkers ascending Mount Damavand. Some of the contributing factors are preventable, so we suggest considering an educational program for trekkers to high altitudes in Iran.					; Ziaee, Vahid/E-2786-2014; Ahmadinejad, Zahra/N-6629-2019; Yunesian, Masud/D-4364-2009; Halabchi, Farzin/A-3191-2019	Kordi, Ramin/0000-0002-0116-3018; Ziaee, Vahid/0000-0003-4648-3573; Ahmadinejad, Zahra/0000-0002-0753-7084; Yunesian, Masud/0000-0002-2870-7433; 													1078-1439					WIN	2003	14	4					214	219		10.1580/1080-6032(2003)14[214:AMSIIT]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1580/1080-6032(2003)14[214:AMSIIT]2.0.CO;2								14719853					WOS:000187753100001
J	SIGLER, WF; VIGG, S; BRES, M				SIGLER, WF; VIGG, S; BRES, M			LIFE-HISTORY OF THE CUI-UI, CHASMISTES-CUJUS COPE, IN PYRAMID LAKE, NEVADA - A REVIEW	GREAT BASIN NATURALIST												The cui-ui, Chasmistes cujus Cope, a member of the sucker family and endemic to Pyramid Lake, Nevada, is listed as endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Cui-ui was once a major source of sustenance for native Americans, who have inhabited the Lahontan region for at least 11,000 years. The Northern Paiutes developed sophisticated fishing technology to harvest this resource. The original distribution of cui-ui was the ancient Lake Lahontan complex, but as a result of climatic changes it was restricted to the Pyramid-Winnemucca-Truckee system by the turn of the 20th century. Transbasin water diversions (1905 to present) have resulted in further restrictions of habitat. The species is now limited to Pyramid Lake and the lower Truckee River. Reproduction is from hatcheries as well as limited natural reproduction. Females produce more than 40,000 2-mm eggs per year. The normal development is described from the unfertilized egg through 912 hours post-hatching, when the fry are actively feeding and approaching adult body form. The unusual feature of adult cui-ui morphology is the relatively large ventro-terminal mouth, with thin and obscurely papillose lips. Cui-ui grow slowly and may live 18 years or possibly much longer, females generally live longer and attain a greater size than males. The highest adult mortality probably occurs during spawning runs. At this time they are vulnerable to predation, stress, and sometimes environmental degradation. The highest larval mortality probably occurs from predation when they are planted or migrate into the lake. The trophic ecology of the species is poorly understood, but they are known to ingest algae and zooplankton. Spawning behavior is documented. At present, natural reproduction is probably still the limiting factor for the cui-ui population. Cui-ui composed less than one percent of the total fish in Pyramid Lake during 1975-2977. During 1982 the largest cui-ui spawning run (13,000) in recent years occurred. The activity of cui-ui n the lake closely resembles that of the Tahoe sucker being most active during the spawning season each spring. Cui-ui inhabit the inshore-benthic zone and the pelagic waters of Pyramid Lake (< 48 m).																			0017-3614					OCT 31	1985	45	4					571	603																WOS:A1985C497100001
J	Jia, JJ; Gao, Y; Song, XW; Chen, SB				Jia, Junjie; Gao, Yang; Song, Xianwei; Chen, Shibo			Characteristics of phytoplankton community and water net primary productivity response to the nutrient status of the Poyang Lake and Gan River, China	ECOHYDROLOGY												Phytoplankton community characteristics and associative primary productivity, which reflect the ecological and nutritional status of water, are sensitive to environmental change. Particularly, nutrient inputs have a significant effect on phytoplankton growth and development as well as the biogeochemical cycle of watersheds. We investigated the phytoplankton community and nutrient status downstream from the Gan River into Poyang Lake. On a catchment scale, the phytoplankton communities and associative primary productivity from these two water bodies differed. The Poyang Lake phytoplankton community is composed of seven phyla of algae, whereas the Gan River is composed of six, the dominant phyla of phytoplankton being Bacillariophyta and Cryptophyta in Poyang Lake and Gan River, respectively. Phytoplankton abundance and primary productivity were significantly higher in Poyang Lake. Lower nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) concentrations and higher carbon (C) and silicon (Si) concentrations significantly affected the phytoplankton communities and primary productivity distribution in the entire Poyang Lake Basin. In this regard, we found a significant correlation between the phytoplankton community of the Gan River and P and N, whereas N and Si primarily regulated the phytoplankton community structure of Poyang Lake. Moreover, we found a significant correlation between DTN, Si/P, DIC/P, and primary productivity in the Gan River, whereas NH4+ jointly controlled primary productivity in Poyang Lake. Furthermore, the Margalef Richness Index (0.84-2.41) can be indicative of the environmental water quality status; and we determined that the most area of Poyang Lake and Gan River both were P restriction and moderately polluted, whereas the entrance of the Gan River into Poyang Lake was seriously polluted, which confirms that the Gan River is a main and crucial source of Poyang Lake pollution. Nanjishan Nature Reserve was already slightly eutrophic due to the high nutrient content and a large number of algae in the south-east of Poyang Lake, but the Gan River had good river fluidity, so some areas of the Gan River were oligotrophic.					; Song, Xianwei/JKJ-0946-2023; Jia, Junjie/AAQ-2527-2020; GAO, Yang/HMO-8142-2023	Song, Xianwei/0000-0003-3071-6870; 													1936-0584	1936-0592				OCT	2019	12	7							e2136	10.1002/eco.2136	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eco.2136		JUL 2019											WOS:000478187700001

Boundary layer and microphysical influences of natural cloud seeding on a lake-effect snowstorm	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												The first detailed observations of the interaction of a synoptic cyclone with a lake-effect convective boundary layer (CBL) were obtained on 5 December 1997 during the Lake-Induced Convection Experiment. Lake-effect precipitation and CBL growth rates were enhanced by natural seeding by snow from higher-level clouds and the modified thermodynamic structure of the air over Lake Michigan due to the cyclone. In situ aircraft observations, project and operational rawinsondes, airborne radar, and operational Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler data were utilized to document the CBL and precipitation structure for comparison with past nonenhanced lake-effect events. Despite modest surface heat fluxes of 100-200 W m(-2), cross-lake CBL growth was greatly accelerated as the convection merged with an overlying reduced-stability layer. Over midlake areas, CBL growth rates averaged more than twice those previously reported for lake-effect and oceanic cold-air outbreak situations. Regions of the lake-effect CBL cloud deck were seeded by precipitation from higher-level clouds over the upwind (western) portions of Lake Michigan before the CBL merged with the overlying reduced-stability layer. In situ aircraft observations suggest that in seeded regions, the CBL was deeper than in nonseeded regions. In addition, average water-equivalent precipitation rates for all of the passes with seeded regions were more than an order of magnitude greater in seeded regions than nonseeded regions because of higher concentration of snow particles of all sizes. A maximum snowfall rate of 4.28 mm day(-1) was calculated using aircraft particle observations in seeded regions, comparable to snowfall rates previously reported for lake-effect events, often with much larger surface heat fluxes, but not interacting with synoptic cyclones.

To understand the geomicrobiological processes of the laminated travertines, we investigated the mound's hydrology, water chemistry, texture, microbial composition, and volume percentage of carbonate mineral (VPC). We identified four types of travertines: dense travertine (80% VPC, flow rate similar to 200 cm/s), lithified microbial travertine (60% VPC, flow rate similar to 70 cm/s), fragile microbial travertine (30% VPC, flow rate similar to 10 cm/s), and poorly lithified microbial mat (< 10% VPC, flow rate < 5 cm/s). The first two types exhibited regular lamination at sub-mm intervals that was associated with the distribution of cyanobacteria and organic substances. The dense travertine consisted of alternation of crystalline and banded layers at similar to 160-mu m intervals, which resembles the daily lamination of an aragonite travertine from southwest Japan. The banded layer formed during the day, exhibited porosity, and contained organic substances. Lamination in the lithified microbial travertine was likely formed by the daily growth cycles of filamentous cyanobacteria. The daytime surface of this travertine appeared to be sub-mm-thick cyanobacterial biofilm with spheroidal aggregates of aragonite, which covered a crystalline layer consisting of radially expanded needle crystals. The crystalline layer was likely formed during the night when the cyanobacterial growth was interrupted. These regularly laminated travertines fabrics appeared to be similar to certain Precambrian stromatolites. Regularity of the lamination was less in the other two microbe-rich types at low-flow sites. The majority of the aragonite occurred as spherical aggregates within the microbial mat, although thin (10-50 mu m) crystal layers in the fragile microbial travertine may indicate daily intervals. As represented in the relationship among the VPC, flow rate, and precipitation rate of aragonite, the travertines were more consolidated with increasing hydrodynamic energy because of the activation of carbonate precipitation and the inhibition of thick cyanobacterial biofilm development.

Controls on the spatial dimensions of wetted hydrologic margins of two antarctic lakes	VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL												Polar deserts are characterized by limited water availability across much of the terrestrial landscape. In the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica, soil active layers are wetted only briefly after infrequent snowfall (< 10 cm yr(-1)). Adjacent to glacial meltwater streams and lakes, however, sediments and soils appear visibly wetted throughout the summer. We hypothesized that this apparent wicking of water from aquatic environments is controlled by capillary action determined by the physical properties of near-shore sediments including slope, particle size distribution, and depth to permafrost. We performed synoptic sampling of near-shore sediments around two lakes in Taylor Valley, East Antarctica. We measured the water content, active layer depth, particle size distribution, and topography to determine the relative importance of shore slope, pore size distribution, and depth of the active layer on the spatial dimension of wetted hydrologic margins. The horizontal dimension (distance from the lake edge) of wetted margins (H-W) and slopes ranged from 1.1 to 32.9 m and 1 to 61% and active layer depth ranged from 5.5 to > 120 cm. Our results indicate that particle size distributions of near-shore sediments are homogeneous; slope had a greater effect on the dimensions of wetted margins, explaining 73% of the variance in HW. These findings show that the spatial dimensions of wetted zones are controlled by a suite of physical parameters that may be easily measured using remotely sensed data and a limited number of samples. Such information is useful for constraining landscape-scale models of nutrient redistribution because intermittently wetted soils are zones of enhanced biogeochemical transformation and transport in desert ecosystems.

M.			Reconstruction of Holocene and Last Interglacial vegetation dynamics and wildfire activity in southern Siberia	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												Wildfires are a rapidly increasing threat to boreal forests. While our understanding of the drivers behind wildfires and their environmental impact is growing, it is mostly limited to the observational period. Here we focus on the boreal forests of southern Siberia and exploit a U-Th-dated stalagmite from Botovskaya Cave, located in the upper Lena region of southern Siberia, to document wildfire activity and vegetation dynamics during parts of two warm periods: the Last Interglacial (LIG; specifically part of the Last Interglacial maximum between 124.1 and 118.8 ka) and the Holocene (10-0 ka). Our record is based on levoglucosan (Lev), a biomarker sensitive to biomass burning, and on lignin oxidation products (LOPs) that discriminate between open and closed forest and hard- or softwood vegetation. In addition, we used carbonate carbon stable isotope ratios (delta 13C), which reflect a dominant control of the host rock, to evaluate soil respiration and local infiltration changes. Our LOP data suggest that, during the Last Interglacial, the region around Botovskaya Cave was characterised by open forest, which by ca. 121.5 ka underwent a transition from fire-resistant hardwood to fire-prone softwood. The Lev record indicates that fire activity was high and increased towards the end of Last Interglacial just before 119 ka. In contrast, the Holocene was characterised by a closed-forest environment with mixed hard- and softwood vegetation. Holocene fire activity varied but at a much lower level than during the Last Interglacial. We attribute the changes in wildfire activity during the intervals of interest to the interplay between vegetation and climate. The open forests of the Last Interglacial were more likely to ignite than their closed Holocene equivalents, and their flammability was aided by warmer and drier summers and a stronger seasonal temperature contrast due to the increase in seasonal insolation difference compared to the Holocene. Our comparison of the last two interglacial intervals suggests that, with increasing global temperatures, the boreal forest of southern Siberia may become progressively more vulnerable to higher wildfire activity.					; Kwiecien, Ola/AAC-8309-2021; Kononov, Aleksandr/K-1614-2015; Hoffmann, Thorsten/A-7490-2012; Breitenbach, Sebastian/AAB-1420-2019	Giesche, Alena/0000-0003-3673-7269; Kwiecien, Ola/0000-0001-6018-9181; Umbo, Stuart/0000-0001-7828-0266; Hoffmann, Thorsten/0000-0003-0939-271X; Vaks, Anton/0000-0002-2982-5220													1814-9324	1814-9332				MAR 20	2025	21	3					661	677		10.5194/cp-21-661-2025	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-21-661-2025													WOS:001447619600001
J	Hauer, FR; Spencer, CN				Hauer, FR; Spencer, CN			Phosphorus and nitrogen dynamics in streams associated with wildfire: A study of immediate and longterm effects	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE												Stream nutrient data were collected both during a wildfire and over a subsequent five-year period. Sampling was from a series of paired watersheds located within and outside of the wildfire. Phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations increased from 5 to 60 fold over background levels during the first few days of the month-long wildfire with maximum recorded concentrations as high as 135 mu g/L soluble reactive phosphorus, 261 mu g/L ammonium, and 61 mu g/L nitrate. Total phosphorus and total nitrogen during this same time period increased up to 206 mu g/L and 349 mu g/L, respectively. Nutrient concentrations declined to background levels (<5-10 mu g/L) within a few weeks after the fire. Over the following five years we observed dissolved nutrient concentrations reaching >40 mu g/L soluble reactive phosphorus and >125 mu g/L nitrate in impacted streams, concentrations >5 fold over those observed in control streams. In high gradient watersheds, all nutrients were easily transported to the streams with most notable impact during the early years after the fire. In less steep terrain, soluble reactive phosphorus concentrations were significantly higher 3 to 5 years after the fire, which also corresponded to relatively high spring hydrographs. In contrast, nitrogen compounds were observed to be significantly higher in concentration in fire impact streams in the years immediately following the fire. We attribute these differences in the rate of nutrient loads to be the result of the different mobilization mechanisms of phosphorus and nitrogen and the different soil and geomorphic settings of the watersheds drained by the different streams.																			1049-8001					DEC	1998	8	4					183	198		10.1071/WF9980183	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WF9980183													WOS:000079118900002

Studies on the ACA dust activities thus are crucial for understanding dust forcing mechanisms and the mitigation of hazardous storms. Located at the downwind margin of the ACA, the Lake Qinghai basin is an ideal trap for dust activities documentation. However, isolating eolian dust signals from Lake Qinghai sediments is difficult as the dust signals are well-mixed with riverine input signals. As a satellite of Lake Qinghai, Lake Erhai is much smaller and has only one inflow river. Lake Erhai, therefore, is much less sensitive to riverine input and its sediments theoretically contain more explicit dust signals. In this study, a 111.5-cm core was taken from Lake Erhai in 2016. The sediments' grain size distribution (GSD) of this core was analyzed, and end-member (EM) analyses were applied to the GSDs to detect dust signals. Sediment carbonate content and carbonate oxygen isotopes (delta 18Ocarb) were also measured to provide independent climate background information. Our results showed that the first EM is attributed to lake level dynamics due to its resemblances with carbonate content and delta 18Ocarb records; the third EM, which peaked in the coarser grain size, is attributed to the riverine input; the remaining second EM likely captures the changes of regional dust activity and suggests that the Lake Qinghai basin has experienced multiple intense eolian dust activity intervals, i.e., 1000-1110, 1180-1290, and 1450-1560 AD over the past 1400 years. A further comparison of EMs with well-established climatic records in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau suggests that the rise and fall of regional dust activities are likely mainly controlled by wetness conditions and are secondarily affected by human activities.

The Tibetan Plateau (TP) affects atmospheric circulation patterns due to its unique geographical location and high elevation, and studies of the mechanisms of climate change on the TP are potentially extremely valuable for understanding the relationship of the region with the global climate system. With the development of biomarker-based proxies, it is possible to use lake sediments to quantitatively reconstruct past temperature variability. The source of Glycerol Dialkyl Glycerol Tetraethers (GDGTs) in lake sediments is complex, and their distribution is controlled by both climatic and environmental factors. In this work, we sampled the surface sediments of 27 lakes on the TP and in addition obtained surface soil samples from six of the lake catchments. We analyzed the factors that influence GDGT distribution in the lake sediments, and established quantitative relationship between GDGTs and Mean Annual Air Temperature (MAAT). Our principal findings are as follows: the majority of GDGTs in the lake sediments are bGDGTs, followed by crenarchaeol and GDGT-0. In most of the lakes there were no significant differences between the GDGT distribution within the lake sediments and the soils in the same catchment, which indicates that the contribution of terrestrial material is important. iGDGTs in lake sediments are mainly influenced by water chemistry parameters (pH and salinity), and that in small lakes on the TP, TEX86 may act as a potential proxy for lake pH; however, in contrast bGDGTs in the lake sediments are mainly controlled by climatic factors. Based on the GDGT distribution in the lake sediments, we used proxies (MBT, CBT) and the fractional abundance of bGDGTs (f(abun)) to establish calibrations between GDGTs and MAAT, respectively, which potentially provide the basis for paleoclimatic reconstruction on the TP.

Stable isotopes constrain the genesis of Thar Desert gypsum playas and reveal Holocene paleoenvironmental variability in Northwest India	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Numerous evaporative saline playa lakes exist within the Thar Desert in Northwest India. Some are active seasonally, whereas others are dry and preserve up to several meters of sedimentary deposits. These deposits feature a variety of evaporite minerals, including the hydrated mineral gypsum (CaSO4 & sdot;2H2O). The isotopic composition of gypsum hydration water preserves the delta 18O and delta D of paleolake water at the time of gypsum formation. This provides a way to understand the hydrologic balance in a part of the world where it is typically very difficult to obtain any paleoclimate records. We present paleohydrological records from two dry playas (Karsandi, Khajuwala) and one active playa (Lunkaransar) in the Thar Desert using the oxygen and hydrogen isotopic composition of gypsum hydration water. We present a theoretical model to explain differences in how the gypsum records water isotopic composition from perennial playas (consistent paleoclimate recorders) as opposed to seasonally fed or ephemeral playas (that reflect evaporated meteoric water inconsistently). Results suggest that enhanced direct precipitation, with associated higher groundwater and possibly fluvial sources, maintained active playa lake basins in the central Thar Desert for the Early through Middle Holocene. We also examine delta 34SSO4, delta 18OSO4, and 87Sr/86Sr of the gypsum sulfate to explore the source and evolution of solutes in the Thar Desert playas. Results indicate that seasalt aerosols likely accumulated in aeolian sands during glacial dry periods and concentrated in playa deposits once a threshold level of moisture was reached in the Early Holocene. By the Late Holocene, after c. 4.4 ka BP, these water sources diminished and some playas were again covered by aeolian deposits. The Thar Desert gypsum deposits provide valuable insight into local moisture balance during a time period that featured important cultural transformation in the surrounding region, including the South Asian Neolithic agricultural societies around 8 ka BP, the full span of the Indus Civilization (5.3-3.3 ka BP), and periods of human occupation after 3 ka BP.

They cause significant environmental damage and pose a considerable biosecurity threat to livestock. Because of their negative impacts, effort is often made by state organisations to eradicate or control sambar deer populations through aerial or ground shooting. These programs can be time-consuming and expensive and, therefore, it is imperative that their effectiveness is evaluated to ensure that program objectives are met.Aims In this study, we aim to quantify deer control efficiency at three different sites across Victoria, Australia; The Bogong High Plains in the Alpine National Park, Lake Tyers State Park and Snowy River National Park.Methods We use non-invasive genetic sampling and spatially explicit capture-recapture population modelling to estimate deer density before and after control operations.Key results Our results showed a reduction in deer density after control at Lake Tyers. Conversely, we were unable to definitively detect a change in deer density in the Bogong High Plains and at Snowy River National Park.Conclusions We hypothesise that the differing results between Lake Tyers and the other two sites may be due to the size of the control and survey areas, timing of our surveys relative to control operations, insufficient control effort, seasonal deer movement and/or re-incursion into our survey areas from the wider parks. Importantly, our results suggest that re-incursion may have a significant impact on deer control in Victoria, particularly in large parks.Implications To minimise re-incursion risks, control operations should be implemented in the summer months at high-altitude sites, and small, isolated populations should be targeted for eradication. At large parks, increased control frequency and intensity over time may be required if continuing reductions in deer density are desired. Our research emphasises the value of genetic sampling and capture-recapture modelling as effective techniques for wildlife monitoring.

This precipitation commonly falls on areas that are distant from the basin; evaporative losses in the desert climate are substantially reduced when runoff is concentrated in channels or when it infiltrates to the groundwater system and is delivered (long after the precipitation event) to a closed basin. Mountain glaciers may both dam desert drainage systems and provide meltwater, and continental ice sheets are known to have impounded vast areas of water in arid regions during the Pleistocene. Increased aridity may actually lead to the formation of freshwater lakes in arid regions through basin deflation, mammal excavation, dune impoundment, reorganization of stratified groundwater systems, and changes in lake surface area/volume ratios. Importantly, that part of the sedimentary and biological record that was deposited during the drying phase of a desert lake - which is one of the most important proxies for establishing an arid paleoclimate - may be missing. This absence may be the result of removal by re-solution or deflation, or be related to the fact that life in highly saline lakes consists mainly of soft-bodied microorganisms that are easily destroyed during subsequent oxidation of the sediments. Thus, the record of a lake basin in an arid rgion may only leave a history of its fresh and brackish water phases, and this may suggest Chat the regional climate was relatively wet, even over long periods. This may pose special problems for paleoclimatic interpretations in the geological record.																			0168-6208		90-5410-451-1				1998	25						241	253																WOS:000080072900021

Rotifers and lower crustaceans from South-western Iceland	BIODIVERSITY DATA JOURNAL												Background Iceland has high availability of freshwater, and it is rich in brackish and coastal aquatic bodies. However, knowledge on rotifers and meiobenthic and planktonic crustaceans inhabiting these habitats is lacking, and the inland aquatic fauna in Iceland is relatively understudied in comparison with the fauna of adjacent marine ecosystems. The majority of past research focused on larger lakes with the exception of one study on rotifers from the 1950s (Bartos 1951) and two more recent studies on crustacean fauna of shallow freshwater bodies (Novichkova et al. 2014, Scher et al. 2000). Data are particularly scarce for the south-western part of the country. New information We studied the composition of selected invertebrate taxa in various aquatic (marine, brackish and freshwater) habitats from South-western Iceland with a focus on Rotifera, Cladocera and Copepoda. Samples were collected from 12 localities, including marine interstitial, freshwater temporary shallow pools, swamps, wet mosses, springs, and lakes (both brackish and freshwater). We found 39 taxa in total. Rotifera dominated the sampled water bodies, followed by Copepoda and Cladocera. Three of the recorded taxa are new for Iceland, of which two are rotifers [Trichocerca cf. mucosa (Stokes, 1896) and T. vernalis (Hauer, 1936)], and one is a marine copepod (Cyclopina gracilis Claus, 1862). For some of the sampled localities (Sikio and Leirvogsvatn Lakes, and some of the smaller habitats) we present the first data on their microinvertebrate fauna.

Hydrogeochemical evolution of inland lakes' water: A study of major element geochemistry in the Wadi El Raiyan depression, Egypt	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED RESEARCH												Wadi El Raiyan is a great depression located southwest of Cairo in the Western Desert of Egypt. Lake Qarun, located north of the study area, is a closed basin with a high evaporation rate. The source of water in the lake is agricultural and municipal drainage from the El Faiyum province. In 1973, Wadi El Raiyan was connected with the agricultural wastewater drainage system of the Faiyum province and received water that exceeded the capacity of Lake Qarun. Two hydrogeological regimes have been established in the area: (i) higher cultivated land and (ii) lower Wadi El Raiyan depression lakes. The agricultural drainage water of the cultivated land has been collected in one main drain (El Wadi Drain) and directed toward the Wadi El Raiyan depression, forming two lakes at different elevations (upper and lower). In the summer of 2012, the major chemical components were studied using data from 36 stations distributed over both hydrogeological regimes in addition to one water sample collected from Bahr Youssef, the main source of freshwater for the Faiyum province. Chemical analyses were made collaboratively. The major ion geochemical evolution of the drainage water recharging the El Raiyan depression was examined. Geochemically, the Bahr Youssef sample is considered the starting point in the geochemical evolution of the studied surface water. In the cultivated area, major-ion chemistry is generally influenced by chemical weathering of rocks and minerals that are associated with anthropogenic inputs, as well as diffuse urban and/or agricultural drainage. In the depression lakes, the water chemistry generally exhibits an evaporation-dependent evolutionary trend that is further modified by cation exchange and precipitation of carbonate minerals.

We also aimed to reveal past climate changes by using ecological requirements of specific aquatic plants as summer temperature indicators. Our results suggest the formation of a mesotrophic mire around 20,000 cal yr BP with brown moss, Betula sp. and Selaginella selaginoides cover beside the occurrence of Phragmites australis, Typha latifolia and T. angustifolia suggesting base-rich fen and tundra-like wet-ground habitats on the lakeshore. This community shifted to reed dominated swamp at c. 18,300 cal yr BP with inferred min. July temperatures of 12-15.7 degrees C. pinus sp., Betula nana, B. penduta/pubescens, Hippuris vulgaris and P. australis dominated until 16,600 cal yr BP pointing to shallow muddy stagnant water and colder climatic conditions than in the preceding interval. The most warmth-demanding species, T. latifolia and T. angustifolia indicated July mean temperatures >14-15.7 degrees C soon after the LGM. The formation of biogenic carbonate also started at an early stage; major accumulation occurred between 15,200 and 10,000 cal yr BP. In the Early Holocene, environmental indicator species (e.g., Phragmites australis and T. latifolia) pointed to warmer and shallower conditions, while the late Holocene was characterized by strong eutrophication and reed swamp dominance on the lakeshore. Elevated macrocharcoal concentration, wood fragments and remains of Typha species suggested frequent local fires and dry mire surface conditions during the last 1700 years. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, for robust reconstructions, improving the understanding of the origin of n-alkanes and their distribution within the lake is essential. Therefore, we examined the distribution pattern of n-alkanes in the aquatic plants within Lake Lugu (a deep alpine lake on the southeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, southwest China), and terrestrial plants and topsoils in the catchment, to unravel the origin of sedimentary n-alkanes and further investigate the spatial distribution of n-alkanes from surface sediments in this lake. The aquatic plants are dominated by mid-chain C-23 and C-25, terrestrial plants and soils by long-chain C-29, and 76% of the surface sediment samples show C-29 predominance. The average chain length (ACL) and the aquatic plant proxy (P-aq) values of surface sediments are between those of aquatic and terrestrial plants and soils. Thus, n-alkanes from autochthonous (aquatic plants) and allochthonous (terrestrial plants and soils) sources were apparent in the surface sediments. A substantial spatial distribution of n-alkanes exists within Lake Lugu: the n-alkane concentrations of total, aquatic, and terrigenous origins are concentrated in the northwestern portion of the lake's north basin, which may be attributed to the underwater topography and increased human-induced soil erosion in this area. Similarly, the clear spatial heterogeneity of ACL(21-33) and P(aq )may suggest that the sedimentary n-alkanes comprise a mixture contribution of autochthonous and allochthonous production, which might be the major source of n-alkanes in the lakeshore, and a higher proportion of autochthonous n-alkanes is present in deep water. However, there is no significant correlation between the P(aq )of sediments and water depth in Lake Lugu; thus, the application of P(aq )as a lake-level indicator should be used with caution in deep-water lakes similar to Lake Lugu.					lv, ligang/GYJ-1373-2022; Lv, Ligang/GYJ-1373-2022; Long, Hao/AFT-1009-2022	Lv, Ligang/0000-0003-3840-6455; 													0031-0182	1872-616X				APR 15	2022	592								110895	10.1016/j.palaeo.2022.110895	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2022.110895		FEB 2022											WOS:000806586900004

Between 23 June and 1 July 1996, nine adult Arctic charr were tagged with external acoustic transmitters, These fish were tracked until 6 July using two radio-linked acoustic array systems and a portable manual receiver with a directional hydrophone. Two transmitters measured temperature and location, one measured depth and location and the remaining sis, location only. All of the lagged charr remained in Cambridge Bay Estuary until the sea-ice had melted and the mouth of the Lay was ice-free. Primarily, they remained in the warmer brackish surface layer which was similar to 2m thick and rarely moved into the colder underlying marine waters. As well, the tagged charr remained either near the shore or over offshore shoals, following the ice-edge as it melted down the estuary. Residence time in the estuary was greater than ten days for some fish. Therefore, in spite of evidence from controlled laboratory studies that have shown that Arctic charr are preadapted to the marine environment and are capable of migrating directly into seawater, this study shows that, in the wild, they prefer to remain in warmer brackish water until the sea-ice has melted and that the transition stage is longer than previously suggested.

Fifty leaves were collected monthly for isolation of fungi by culture techniques such as leaf disks washing and plating on potato-dextrose-agar, maltose-pentose-agar, inorganic-salt-agar, malt-extract-agar; culture in moist chamber, and baiting with corn leaves, cellophane, snake skin, hemp and Sorghum seeds. For the observation of the tetraradiate fungi, a part of the leaf samples were incubated in an aquarium with aired sterilized pond water. Terrestrial fungi as Trichoderma viride Pers., Mucor hiemalis Wehmer, Aspergillus niger van Tieghem, Cylindrocladium scoparium Morgan, Cyhlindrocladium parvum Anderson and Alternaria alternata (Fr.) Keissler isolated before the submergence were present in the leaves during the whole experiment. Zoosporic fungi such as Achlya dubia Coker, Achlya flagellata Coked, Saprolegnia sp. and Nowakowskiella elegans (Nowak) Schroeter took part actively on fungal succession that occurred on Fiscus microcarpa leaves as well as the tetraradiate fungi, never cited in Brazil before. Isolation procedures, culture methods and baiting techniques, when used together provided good results in studies of fungal succession in submerged leaves.

Diffusive gradients in thin-films (DGT) for in situ measurement of neonicotinoid insecticides (NNIs) in waters	WATER RESEARCH												Neonicotinoid insecticides (NNIs) are among the most widely-used insecticides, although their threat to non- target organisms has attracted attention in recent years. In this study, a diffusive gradient in thin-films (DGT) passive sampling technique was developed for in situ monitoring of time-weighted average (TWA) concentrations of NNIs in groundwater and wastewater. Systematic studies demonstrated that DGT with HLB as binding gels (HLB-DGT) is suitable for quantitative sampling of NNIs under a wide range of conditions, independent of pH (5-9.5), ionic strength (0.001-0.5 M) and dissolved organic matter (0-10 mg/L). The HLB-DGT performance was also independent of the typical groundwater ionic environments. The thicknesses of in-situ measured diffusive boundary layer were 0.35 and 0.25 mm in the groundwater and effluent, respectively. HLB-DGT can provide TWA concentrations over 14-18 days' deployment with linear uptake in both groundwater and wastewater. Concentrations and occurrence patterns of NNIs obtained by HLB-DGT were consistent with those measured from grab samples. The median TWA concentration of NNIs was 4.42 ng/L in water from the largest urban lake of China (the Tangxun Lake) in winter, with wastewater discharge being the main potential source. The reliability and stability of the HLB-DGT for measuring NNIs in the groundwater and surface water were confirmed and can be used to improve understanding of the occurrence and fate of NNIs in aquatic environment.

We emphasise comparing different sediment parameters by means of statistical methods as well as integrating chronological uncertainties along with uncertainties of reconstructed glacier variability. A multi-proxy data set consisting of sedimentological, physical, and geochemical data shows one main process, as extracted by means of principal component analysis (88% of the variance explained by the first PC), driving sediment variability in Nedre Sorsendalsvatn. The common signal extracted from the sediment data is indicative of glacial activity in the catchment and is interpreted to vary in concert with the changing glacier equilibrium-line altitude. The reconstruction of former glacier activity is in accordance with glacier variability reconstructed from other sites in western Norway, including the termination of the deglaciation at approximately 10,000 cal yr BP, the 8.2 ka BP (Finse) event, the Holocene thermal optimum between 8000 and 5500 cal yr BP, and the onset of the Neoglacial at 5500 cal yr BP. The largest glacial extent during the Neoglacial time period took place during the 'Little Ice Age'. The combined radiocarbon chronologies from three different sediment cores provide insight into the duration of the "8.2 ka event" in the terrestrial system. The maximum glacier activity at approximately 8.2 cal BP is the culmination of a glacier advance that began around 9 cal BP and accelerated at 8.4 cal BP. The glacier advance ended abruptly at 8.0 cal BP. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

During the period from the cold phase (GS 18/19) to warm phase (D-O 19), the biome shift from temperate conifer forest to cold/cool conifer forest in Japan and from subtropical forest to temperate deciduous/conifer forest in Taiwan. The vegetation in D-O 17, cool mixed forest in central Japan, temperate deciduous broadleaf forest in western Japan and subtropical forest in Taiwan, indicates warm condition but not wet in all area. These vegetation changes lead to biome shift from MIS (Marine Isotope Stage) 4 to MIS 3. The abundance of Cryptomeria japonica and Fagus crenata in D-O 12 and D-O 8 indicates wet conditions brought by the strong summer monsoon through the Islands and high snowfall brought by the inflow of the Tsushima Warm Current into the Sea of Japan. The registration of other D-O warming events in MIS 3, although reflected by shifts in the abundance of key species, is not sufficient to produce changes in biomes. Development of cold deciduous forest in HS (Heinrich events) 1 in Sakhalin, Hokkaido and central Japan was conspicuous and was much larger than that in YD. Vegetation response in YD was small scale and within the same biome in the East Asian Islands. In D-O 1 at the termination of the last glacial, the same taxa that developed in the early Holocene, cold evergreen needleleaf trees in northern region, temperate deciduous broadleaf trees in central and western Japan, and warm-temperate evergreen trees in Taiwan, increased.

Yeast Diversity on Sandy Lake Beaches Used for Recreation in Olsztyn, Poland	PATHOGENS												Yeasts possess a range of environmental adaptations that allow them to colonize soil and sand. They can circulate seasonally between different components of lake ecosystems, including beach sand, water, and the coastal phyllosphere. The accumulation of people on beaches promotes the development and transmission of yeasts, posing an increasing sanitary and epidemiological risk. The aim of this study was to determine the species and quantitative composition of potentially pathogenic and pathogenic yeasts for humans present in the sand of supervised and unsupervised beaches along the shores of lakes in the city of Olsztyn (northeastern Poland). The study material consisted of sand samples collected during two summer seasons (2019; 2020) from 12 research sites on sandy beaches of four lakes located within the administrative boundaries of Olsztyn. Standard isolation and identification methods used in diagnostic mycological laboratories were applied and are described in detail in the following sections of this study. A total of 259 yeast isolates (264, counting species in two-species isolates separately) belonging to 62 species representing 47 genera were obtained during the study. Among all the isolates, five were identified as mixed (two species from a single colony). Eight isolated species were classified into biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) and risk group 2 (RG-2). The highest average number of viable yeast cells was found in sand samples collected in July 2019 (5.56 x 102 CFU/g), August, and September 2020 (1.03 x 103 CFU/g and 1.94 x 103 CFU/g, respectively). The lowest concentrations were in samples collected in April, September, and October 2019, and October 2020 (1.48 x 102 CFU/g, 1.47 x 102 CFU/g, 1.40 x 102 CFU/g, and 1.40 x 102 CFU/g, respectively). The results indicate sand contamination with yeasts that may pose etiological factors for human mycoses. In light of these findings, continuous sanitary-epidemiological monitoring of beach sand and further studies on its mycological cleanliness are warranted, along with actions leading to appropriate legal regulations.

J	Meerbeek, JR				Meerbeek, Jonathan R.			Poststocking Behavior and Survival of Large Yearling Muskellunge (Esox masquinongy) in Two Northern Iowa Natural Lakes	FISHES												Muskellunge are commonly stocked to maintain populations throughout much of North America. Poststocking survival is variable, and many jurisdictions are experimenting with stocking Muskellunge at advanced life stages (e.g., yearlings) or sizes to promote more consistent recruitment within populations. Yet, little is known about short-term poststocking behavior or survival of Muskellunge in natural lakes or if stocking larger fish results in improved poststocking survival. Radiotelemetry was used to evaluate the behavior and survival of large (mean of 418 mm; standard error of 3.4) spring-stocked yearling Muskellunge in two northern Iowa natural lakes of varying biotic and abiotic complexity. Hatchery-reared Muskellunge were fitted with radio transmitters (n = 10-15 fish/lake), stocked in each lake with conspecifics, and tracked either daily or weekly up to 112 days poststocking. Telemetry data were used to evaluate dispersal and movement, depth and vegetation use, proximity to shore, and survival. In both lakes, fish dispersed rapidly from each stocking site. Movement among lakes was similar and peaked during the first week poststocking and declined thereafter. Muskellunge were frequently located in offshore habitats in both lakes, but both depth and vegetation use varied among lakes and weeks poststocking, with Muskellunge found in deeper, more vegetated habitats in the larger, more complex natural lake. Muskellunge in both systems had high poststocking survival (86.7-90.0%). The results of this study provide managers with more information regarding yearling Muskellunge poststocking behavior and survival and indicate that larger fish may be a suitable alternative for fisheries where high poststocking mortality may be acting as a bottleneck for maintaining quality Muskellunge fisheries.																				2410-3888				JUN	2024	9	6							216	10.3390/fishes9060216	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fishes9060216													WOS:001257536200001
J	Vilenica, M; Vuckovic, N; Mihaljevic, Z				Vilenica, Marina; Vuckovic, Natalija; Mihaljevic, Zlatko			Littoral mayfly assemblages in South-East European man-made lakes	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Man-made freshwater habitats have been widely used to successfully modify the environment for human benefit, including purposes of irrigation, flood control or electricity generation. Over the past decade, our knowledge about the mayfly fauna and its ecology in South-East Europe has been growing, yet the data related to lentic assemblages remain very scarce. In this study, littoral mayfly assemblages were investigated at artificial and heavily modified lentic habitats in the Dinaric Western Balkan (n=21) and Pannonian Lowland (n=15) ecoregions. Mayfly nymphs were sampled during the summer months of 2016 or 2017. At each sampling site, ten samples were collected using a benthos hand net. A total of 21 mayfly species were recorded, though species richness per site was rather low (i.e., between zero and seven species). Cloeon dipterum (Linnaeus, 1761) was the most frequent species recorded, while Caenis horaria Linnaeus, 1758 was the most abundant. This study showed that the Croatian mayfly fauna is still growing, with the first record of Siphlonurus aestivalis Eaton, 1903 for the country. The assemblage structure was mainly dominated by lower reaches and lentic (potamal and littoral) elements and detritivores (gatherers/collectors and active filter feeders). Orthophosphates and chemical oxygen demand had the highest influence on mayfly assemblages, reflecting a higher level of pollution at sites in the Pannonian Lowland ecoregion, and consequently markedly lower mayfly abundances. As mayflies are widely used as bioindicators of freshwater ecosystems, detailed information about their assemblages in heavily modified and artificial habitats could contribute to future conservation activities of freshwater habitats and their communities. Additionally, these results could be applied in creating a monitoring system for artificial lakes according to the requirements of the European Water Framework Directive.

Multidimensional data set was explored by the use of the self-organizing map (SOM) technique to avoid supervised and predictable division for fully isolated, partially and fully connected lakes. Water quality assessment based on single parameter's mean value allowed classification of majority of lakes to first or second class of purity according to regulation presenting classification approach applicable to uniform parts of surface waters. The SOM-based grouping revealed seven clusters comprising water samples of similar physico-chemical profile. Fully connected lakes were characterized by the highest concentration of components characteristic for sea salts (NaCl, MgCl2, MgSO4, CaSO4, K2SO4 and MgBr2), however spring samples from Lebsko were shifted to another cluster suggesting that intensive surface run-off and fresh-water inflow through Lupawa river decreases an impact of sea water intrusions. Forecasted characteristic of water collected in Resko Przymorskie lake was disturbed by high contamination by nitrites indicating accidental and local contamination due to usage of sodium nitrite for the curing of meat. Some unexpected sources of contamination was discovered in intermittently open and closed lakes. Presumably Zn contamination is due to use of wood preservatives to protect small wooden playgrounds or camping places spread around one of the lake, while increased concentration of Ni could be connected with grass and vegetation burning. Waters of jamno lake are under the strongest anthropogenic impact due to inefficient removal of phosphates by waste water treatment plant and contamination by Fe and Mn caused by backwashing of absorption filters. Generally, the quality of ICOLLs' water was diversified, while anthropogenic impact as well as sea water intrusions determine its quality in temporal and spatial scale. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Lacustrine deposits that accumulated in the Quaternary lakes filling the Dead Sea Basin include remobilized eolian desert dust that was washed to the lakes by floods. Here, we analyze the mineralogical, chemical compositions (e.g. Mg/Al ratios) and Sr-87/ Sr-86 and Nd-143/Nd-144 (epsilon Nd values) isotope ratios of fine siliciclastic particles that form the modern surface cover of the Dead Sea watershed (e.g., loess, mountain soils) and flood particles that are mobilized to the lake during distinct synoptic conditions. The data comprises reference data set that can be used for paleo-synoptic interpretation enhancing our ability to decipher the paleoclimate history during the Quaternary in the Levant. The epsilon Nd values and Sr-87/ (86)sr ratios of the fine detritus lie between -8 and -6 and 0.7035 to 0.7188 reflecting the values of erosional products of granitoids that are exposed in the Sahara and Arabia deserts, and (the un-radiogenic Sr) from local soils in the Dead Sea watershed. Particles with low Mg/Al ratios (i.e., 0.17-0.31) are transported by the western winds associated with the Mediterranean cyclones, transporting dust from the Sahara, while particles with high Mg/Al ratios (0.27-0.68) are associated with storms blowing dusts from east to the Dead Sea watershed (Saudi Arabia and Syrian deserts) during Red Sea Trough synoptic conditions. Fine particles blown from the Sahara deserts during winter storms, are rapidly washed to the lake by subsequent floods. Whereas the particles blown during dry storms associated with Red Sea Trough synoptic conditions, accumulate on the surface of the Dead Sea watershed and can be washed later to the lake during extensive rain events.

However, the reaction and fate of weathering products may significantly affect the magnitude of the sink. Carbon mass balances were determined in Hongfeng Lake, a small artificial lake located in the carbonate plateau of SW China. This was accomplished by measuring the concentrations of DIC (dissolved inorganic C), DOC (dissolved organic C), POC (particulate organic C), and CO2 partial pressure in lake waters, inflows and outflows, and in surrounding spring waters. Results show that maximum DIC (mainly HCO3- derived from carbonate weathering by CO2) to DOC ratios in the catchment export load reach similar to 21, implying that as much as similar to 80% of the exported primary production is in the form of HCO3-, and, therefore, the CO2 consumed by carbonate weathering and subsequent DIC export is a critical component of the C balance in this ecosystem. This exported HCO3- subsidizes C cycling of aquatic ecosystems in the catchment, and 32% (excluding carbonate-derived C) returns to the atmosphere as CO2 evasion through the fluvial and lacustrine water-air interface and 10% is stored in lake sediment. This lake has a small CO2 emission rate (13.2 +/- 3.9 mmol m(-2) d(-1), or 0.097 mol m(-2) a(-1) relative to catchment area) compared to mean values for many reservoirs found in temperate and tropical climatic zones. This is likely due in part to low organic C loads supplied by the karst-dominated catchment, and low lake water DOC concentrations. The estimate indicates that more C (39%) returns to the atmosphere and much less (13%) is stored in sediments, implying that the C sink of carbonate weathering may not be as significant as once thought.

However, the flux of oxygen by ebullition has not received much attention in environmental science. For a better quantitative understanding of the oxygen flux due to ebullition, we conducted a series of laboratory experiments, where we forced macrophytes to produce photosynthetic gas bubbles. Raising the CO2 concentration in the water greatly increased bubble formation. Depth was varied to compare the results with theoretically predicted composition of photosynthetic bubbles forming at minimum required gas pressure. Oxygen concentrations lay between this theoretical line as lower boundary (ca. 21% O2 at 0.3 m depth and 45% of O2 at 4.5 m) and 45% of oxygen as the purely empirical upper limit for all depths. As a consequence, no bubble formation was observed at depths below 4.5 m. Under light, green plants produce oxygen, when they grow. Submerged plants can produce bubbles under these conditions. Some of these bubbles rise to the surface and hence transport oxygen out of the water into the atmosphere. We studied this process by measuring the composition of such bubbles in a laboratory experiment. Adding carbonic acid to the water boosted the bubble production a lot. Depending of depth, there is a minimum of gases required for bubble formation, which yields a theoretical minimum concentration for oxygen. In all experiments, the oxygen concentration of bubbles was above atmospheric percentage of 21%, but always below 45%. Photosynthetic gas bubbles from submerged macrophytes contain other gases beyond oxygenThe depth-dependent lower limit can be derived from minimum gas pressure consideration for the formation of bubblesEmpirically we find an upper limit of 45% of oxygen in the collected gas bubbles					; Aurich, Patrick/NFS-4887-2025; Koschorreck, Matthias/E-1251-2015	Aurich, Patrick/0000-0003-2598-9305; Reinschke, Lena/0000-0001-9491-1339; Koschorreck, Matthias/0000-0002-4393-3500; Shikhani, Muhammed/0000-0003-3558-4328; Boehrer, Bertram/0000-0001-6253-6634													0043-1397	1944-7973				JAN	2024	60	1							e2022WR034010	10.1029/2022WR034010	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022WR034010													WOS:001148395600001
J	Fietz, S; Nicklisch, A				Fietz, S; Nicklisch, A			An HPLC analysis of the summer phytoplankton assemblage in Lake Baikal	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The enormous size and spatial heterogeneity of Lake Baikal require rapid methods for large sample sets. We therefore tested the applicability of a novel, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-based, combination of methods for analysing phytoplankton. In July 2001, samples were collected in a transect across the lake at various depths down to 30 m. Phytoplankton (>3 mum) and autotrophic picoplankton (APP) were counted under light and epifluorescence microscopes, respectively. Pigments were analysed with HPLC. 2. The pigment data allowed the contributions of the dominant phytoplankton groups to the total chlorophyll a (Chl a) in the lake to be estimated by multiple linear regression and by the CHEMTAX matrix factorisation program. Three marker pigments, fucoxanthin, lutein and zeaxanthin, were shown to be useful indicators of the abundance and spatial distribution of certain phytoplankton groups. The relative contributions of the various phytoplankton groups to the total Chl a in the lake determined using these marker pigments were similar, but not identical, to those determined by cell counts. 3. Pigment analyses of isolated strains from Lake Baikal and some European lakes confirmed that phycoerythrin-containing Cyanobacteria with very high amounts of zeaxanthin were responsible for the low Chl a/zeaxanthin ratios of the water samples. A picoplanktonic species of Eustigmatophyceae was isolated from the lake. Its high violaxanthin content, responsible for very low Chl a/violaxanthin ratios of some water samples, can be used to estimate the contribution of this group to total Chl a.

J	Warnock, N; Haig, SM; Oring, LW				Warnock, N; Haig, SM; Oring, LW			Monitoring species richness and abundance of shorebirds in the western Great Basin	CONDOR												Broad-scale avian surveys have been attempted within North America with mixed results. Arid regions, such as the Great Basin, are often poorly sampled because of the vastness of the region, inaccessibility of sites, and few ornithologists. In addition, extreme variability in wetland habitat conditions present special problems for conducting censuses of species inhabiting these areas. We examined these issues in assessing multi-scale shorebird (order: Charadriiformes) censuses conducted in the western Great Basin from 1992-1997. On ground surveys, we recorded 31 species of shorebirds, but were unable to accurately estimate population size. Conversely, on aerial surveys we were able to estimate regional abundance of some shorebirds, but were unable to determine species diversity. Aerial surveys of three large alkali lakes in Oregon (Goose, Summer, and Abert Lakes) revealed > 300,000 shorebirds in one year of this study, of which 67% were American Avocets (Recurvirostra americana) and 30% phalaropes (Phalaropus spp.). These lakes clearly meet Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network guidelines for designation as important shorebird sites. Based upon simulations of our monitoring effort and the magnitude and variation of numbers of American Avocets, detection of 5-10% negative declines in populations of these birds would take a minimum of 7-23 years of comparable effort. We conclude that a combination of ground and aerial surveys must be conducted at multiple sites and years and over a large region to obtain an accurate picture of the diversity, abundance, and trends of shorebirds in the western Great Basin.

Based on the diagnostic distributions of some alleles at Gpi, Mpi, Mdh-1, and Mdh-2, these populations were largely classified into two types (A and B). The A type occurred in lakes, ponds, and rivers, while the B type was observed only in rivers. Average Nei''s genetic distance (D) between the two types fell into the subspecies range (.hivin.D=0.1186). The coefficient of gene differentiation, GST, varied considerably between the two types. In 12 populations of the A type, with a GST value of 0.281, nine pond and lake populations showed a higher GST (0.246) than the three river populations (0.151). On the other hand, GST was 0.036 for the eight local populations for the B type. The lower rostrum tooth number had a mode of two in type A and three in type B. Type-A populations largely varied in the upper rostrum tooth number and egg size but type B did not. Under laboratory conditions, mating frequently occurred within each type, but not between types. Furthermore, no embryonic development was observed in the few cases of intertype mating. These results indicate that the A and B types had experienced cladogenic separation with pre- or postmating isolation, whereafter the A type, under geographic isolation, underwent genetic and phenotypic differentiation, while the B type, under extensive gene flow, did not undergo differentiation.

J	Kushlan, JA				Kushlan, James A.			A History of Conserving Colonial Waterbirds in the United States	WATERBIRDS												The commentary follows the story of colonial waterbird conservation in the United States over the past 150 years. Colonial waterbirds, especially egrets and pelicans, played an important role in the founding of the American bird conservation movement. At the beginning of the 20th Century, bird conservation activity self-organized, inspired creation of refuges for colonial waterbirds, protected colonies with wardens, and secured passage of conservation laws. Thereafter Federal and state governments slowly grew in their authorities and commitment to bird conservation. Successes achieved, colonial waterbirds fell from priority during the remainder of the first half of the 20th Century, although legislative, administrative and academic progress was made of considerable subsequent value. In the 1960s and 1970s, colonial waterbirds resumed a significant role, first in contaminant studies and then in population inventories. This engagement encouraged maturation of a colonial waterbird research and conservation agenda in the United States, including founding of the Waterbird Society which facilitated a blossoming of colonial waterbird research in the succeeding decades. In the national conservation planning initiatives of the 1990s, colonial waterbirds were represented by the North American Waterbird Conservation Plan, later Waterbird Conservation for the Americas. Waterbirds are now well integrated in bird conservation planning and action at multiple scales in the United States. Conservation biology, assessment, protection and site management have progressed well, while population estimation, monitoring and data archiving have not. Appropriate direction seems clear, involving regional coordination of the actions of local stakeholders.

THE DIFFERENCES AMONG MELON GENOTYPES AND VARIETIES UNDER SALT STRESS BASED ON CERTAIN MORPHOLOGICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES - MIXTURE MODELING AND PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS (PCA)	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Present study aimed to determine the effects of salt stress in 13 melon genotypes and 4 commercial melon varieties collected from the Van Lake Basin. Two doses of salt applications were conducted at 0 mM and 50 mM NaCl concentrations and the plants were cultivated in 3 repeats under 25 +/- 2 degrees C temperature and 16/8 light/dark periods based on the randomized block experimental design in climate chamber conditions. In order to determine the effect of stress, traits such as 0-5 scale, shoot and root lengths, shoot diameters, leaf number, fresh and dry weights of shoots and roots, leaf relative water content, membrane injury index, stoma widths and lengths, stomatal areas and stoma densities were evaluated. The reaction of the genotypes against stress was determined via mixture modeling and PCA analysis. In PCA analysis, three PCA components explained 71.48% of the total variation at 0 mM, while four components explained 69.53% of the total variation at 50 mM. As a result of the mixture modeling analysis, it was observed that 4 sub-populations for 0 mM and 3 sub-populations for 50 mM were formed and it was revealed that the salt-tolerant genotypes were in the sub-population 3 and salt-susceptible genotypes were in the sub-population 1.																			1589-1623	1785-0037					2019	17	2					2965	2981		10.15666/aeer/1702_29652981	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/1702_29652981													WOS:000462830400099

Evaluating planktonic diatom response to climate change across three lakes with differing morphometry	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												We applied a diatom-based thermal stratification index to sediment cores from three lakes in the northeast USA to evaluate the influence of lake morphometry and within-lake processes on diatom responses to climate change. The three lakes all had surface area > 5 km(2) and experienced the same regional declines in wind speed and progressively earlier ice-out dates, but differed in morphometry, particularly surface area and mean depth. We coupled this paleolimnological approach with contemporary ecological measurements to validate the use of two indicator species (Aulacoseira subarctica (O. Muller) Haworth and Discostella stelligera (Cleve & Grunow) Houk & Klee) in the stratification index. D. stelligera was abundant during stratified conditions in Tunk Lake and Sebago Lake, but not in Lobster Lake. Diatom-inferred stratification shifted to shallower and/or longer duration in Tunk Lake starting in the late nineteenth century, and continued to become shallower over much of the twentieth century. A shift to shallower and/or longer duration was also apparent in Sebago Lake starting around 1850, after which the index suggested little change, even though ice-out occurred 30 days earlier in 2000 than in 1807 and wind speed began to decline in the 1960s. This lake has very slow sedimentation rates, experiences regular seiches, and has D. stelligera present during circulation and stratified periods. These factors may smooth stratification-driven diatom responses. Contemporary ecological measurements did not support the application of the stratification index in Lobster Lake because D. stelligera bloomed only during spring turnover. In Lobster Lake, the relative abundances of D. stelligera in the sediment record showed some variation over time, were generally lower in periods with earlier ice-out in the region, and have been lower since the 1980s. Our results highlight the different responses recorded in the sediments of three large lakes in the same region to climate-driven changes and support the use of indicator species in reconstructing lake thermal stratification patterns when paired with site-specific morphometric and ecological data.																			0921-2728	1573-0417				JUN	2016	56	1					33	47		10.1007/s10933-016-9889-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-016-9889-z													WOS:000376893600003
J	Rutter, MA; Bence, JR				Rutter, MA; Bence, JR			An improved method to estimate sea lamprey wounding rate on hosts with application to lake trout in Lake Huron	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												To better estimate wounding rates on hosts of sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) in the Great Lakes, methods were developed to fit a logistic model for the mean number of wounds per host as a function of host length. These methods were applied to the number of wounds (the sum of type A-I to A-III marks on hosts collected in spring) on individual lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) collected by surveys and by a commercial fishery in three regions of U.S. waters of Lake Huron from 1984 to 2000. Wounds per fish were assumed to follow a Poisson distribution, and a number of models were examined using maximum likelihood techniques. Parameters were allowed to vary spatially and temporally, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques were used to evaluate uncertainty in parameter values. By using data for individual hosts and modeling the effect of host length as a. continuous function, this method makes more complete use of available data, increases precision, and removes biases in comparison with widely used approaches for estimating wounding rates. In this application, the asymptote, or wounding rate on the largest lake trout, varied over years and among lake regions. In addition, the inflection point (where wounding rates increased most rapidly toward the asymptote) varied among regions, shifting toward smaller lake trout lengths further north in Lake Huron. This change in shape suggests some complexity in the sea lamprey-lake trout interaction. For a 500-mm lake trout, a host size observed in all areas, estimated wounding rates were highest in the north.

J	Poissant, L; Pilote, M; Casimir, A				Poissant, L; Pilote, M; Casimir, A			Mercury flux measurements in a naturally enriched area: Correlation with environmental conditions during the Nevada Study and Tests of the Release of Mercury From Soils (STORMS)	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												An international intercomparison of micrometerological techniques and dynamic flux chamber methods applied to measure mercury fluxes was conducted from September 1 to 4, 1997, during the Nevada Study and Tests of the Release of Mercury From Soils (STORMS) in Reno, Nevada. Nine research groups from four countries met in the Steamboat Springs, Nevada Geothermal Area, to participate in the first international flux intercomparison ever attempted for mercury. The highly heterogeneous soil Hg concentrations and complex landscape within the study area (4 ha) were unfavorable for spatial intercomparison of Hg fluxes between the research groups. However, reliable and correlated Hg fluxes were measured between our micrometerological technique and a dynamic flux chamber method (r(2) = 0.29), run side by side (5 m). Hg fluxes and their relationships with environmental factors were complex. After similar to 90 days of dry condition, a series of storm events impacted the site and increased the soil moisture from < 0.5 to 6.6%. This appeared to promote strong Hg evasion during the transition period from dry to wet soil conditions. However, the subsequent relationship between soil moisture and Hg flux was significantly negatively correlated. Multivariate analysis was applied to extract the principal components (principal component analysis). Three principal components were extracted (explained up to 79% of the total variance) and discussed with respect to their environmental signification. Environmental conditions under southern wind sectors were optimal to promote Hg fluxes. Turbulence rather than Hg air concentrations seemed to be the main factor promoting the determined Hg fluxes during this study.

J	Shi, N; Wang, YC; Suolangtajie				Shi, Ning; Wang, Yicheng; Suolangtajie			Energetics of Boreal Wintertime Blocking Highs around the Ural Mountains	JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH												Based on the daily Japanese 55-yr reanalysis data, this study analyzes the maintenance mechanism for 53 boreal winter blocking highs around the Ural Mountains (UBHs) during 1958-2018 based on the atmospheric energy budget equations. After decomposing the circulation into background flow, low-frequency anomalies, and high-frequency eddies, it was found that the interaction between the background flow and low-frequency anomalies is conducive to the maintenance of the UBHs. Due to the southwestward gradient in the climatological mean air temperature over the Eurasian continent, it is easy for the air temperature anomalies as well as the wind velocity anomalies in the middle and lower troposphere induced by the UBHs to facilitate the positive conversion of baroclinic energy associated with the background flow into the UBHs. Likewise, the conversion of barotropic energy associated with the background flow is also evident in the upper troposphere, in which the climatological mean westerlies have evident southward gradient to the northwest of Lake Baikal and southwestward gradient over Barents Sea. Note that the conversion of baroclinic energy associated with the background flow is dominant throughout the lifecycle of UBHs, acting as the major contributor to the maintenance of the UBHs. Although transient eddies facilitate maintenance of the UBHs via positive conversion of barotropic energy in the middle and upper troposphere, they hinder the maintenance of UBHs via negative conversion of baroclinic energy in the lower troposphere. The diabatic heating anomalies tend to counteract the local air temperature anomalies in the middle and lower troposphere, which damps the available potential energy of UBHs and acts as a negative contributor to the UBHs.

Late Holocene ecological shifts and chironomid-inferred summer temperature changes reconstructed from Lake Uddelermeer, the Netherlands	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												This paper presents a late Holocene chironomid-inferred record of July air temperature from a core obtained from Lake Uddelermeer in the Netherlands. The core interval, which dates from 2500 to 400 cal. yr. BP, was analysed at multi-decadal resolution for organic content, pollen, spores and NPPs (Non Pollen Palynomorphs), and chironomid head capsules. These proxies indicate that, from 2500 to 1140 cal. yr. BP, the lake was mesotrophic and sustained a Littorellion community, while the chironomid assemblage was dominated by littoral species associated with macrophytes. At 1140 cal. yr. BP, a shift in the lake ecology occurred from low-nutrient to high-nutrient conditions dominated by algae. This shift might be linked to a concurrent increase in human impact and is reflected in the chironomid assemblage by increases in eurytopic taxa, which are resistant to disturbances. Shifts in the chironomid record between 2500 and 1140 cal. yr. BP do not coincide with changes in lake ecology and are presumably driven by climate change. Using a Norwegian-Swiss calibration dataset as a modern analogue, we produced a chironomid-inferred temperature (C-IT) reconstruction. This reconstruction compares well to other regional temperature reconstructions in timing and duration showing a Roman Warm Period between 2240 and 1760 cal. yr. BP, a Dark Age Cold Period starting at 1760 cal. yr. BP and the Medieval Climate Anomaly beginning at 1280 cal. yr. BP. The C-IT record indicates a temperature drop of 1.5 degrees C from the Roman Warm Period to the Dark Age Cold Period. Findings improve knowledge of the first millennium AD in NW Europe, which was characterised by changes in landscape, vegetation, society and climate.

J	Knowlton, MF; Jones, JR				Knowlton, MF; Jones, JR			Trophic status of Missouri River floodplain lakes in relation to basin type and connectivity	WETLANDS												Limnological data were collected over a two-year period from 12 lakes in the Missouri River floodplain in order to evaluate lake trophic status and the influence of basin type and connectivity on nutrient, seston, and phytoplankton dynamics. The lakes were located in west-central Missouri and included eight scour basins formed by levee breaks during a 1993 flood and four older oxbow lakes. The Missouri River was also sampled. Five of the scour basins (connected scours) were inundated by the Missouri River for varying periods during the study. The other lakes (protected lakes) were hydrologically isolated from the river by levees. On the basis of mean total phosphorus (TP-61-282 mu g/L), mean total nitrogen (TN-0.7-2.1 mg/L), mean chlorophyll (CHL-22-67 mu g/L), and mean suspended solids (TSS-16-93 mg/L), all 12 sites were highly eutrophic compared to other lakes in Missouri. Nutrient fractions and seston composition indicated dominance of inorganic nutrients and abiotic seston in the riverine lakes. Maximum concentrations of nutrients and TSS occurred in oxbow lakes during periods of sediment resuspension and in connected scours during floods in spring 1995 and 1996 when connected sites were inundated by the Missouri River. Algal blooms with peak CHL >200 mu g/L occurred sporadically in the oxbow lakes. Similarly large blooms (peak CHL 81-689 mu g/L) occurred in connected scours when low river levels reduced exchange with the river. Reduced connectivity was accompanied by rapid loss of dissolved N and P fractions, especially nitrate. Protected scours had lower average TP, TN, and TSS than the other sites and were less temporally variable.																			0277-5212					DEC	1997	17	4					468	475		10.1007/BF03161512	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF03161512													WOS:000071128000004
