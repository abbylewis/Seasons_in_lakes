Species composition, individual number and the ratio of functional feeding groups of the colonizing macroinvertebrate community were recorded between July 1997 and May 2000. Forty-one taxa were present during the study period. Dominant taxa were Diptera, Isopoda and Gastropoda. Collectors, their ratio ranged from 25 to 85%, dominated the invertebrate community. Grazer-scrapers and shredders were also significant besides collectors. In the dominance of collectors-scrapers in first half of the experiment was replaced by collectors - shredders in the second half of the experiment. The Shannon diversity and taxa richness were highest in the first year of decomposition. These samples formed a separate group on the dendrogram of cluster analysis. The structure and chemical composition of the plant material and the actual environmental factors determined the macroinvertebrate community colonizing decomposing reed rhizome litter.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV 15	2003	506	1-3					413	420		10.1023/B:HYDR.0000008619.84133.9f	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000008619.84133.9f													WOS:000188455600055

USA	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Total wet mercury deposition was monitored weekly at six Up per Midwest, U.S.A. sites for a period of six ye a rs, 1990-1995, to assess temporal and spatial patterns and contributions to surface waters. Annual wet mercury deposition averaged 7.4 mu g Hg/m(2).yr and showed significant variations between sites and increased trends averaging 0.60 mu g Hg/m(2).yr [8%/yr] over the period (p < 0.0001). Warm (rain) season wet mercury deposition was found to average 77% of total annual wet deposition. Warm train) and cold (snow) season trends showed increases of 0.31 [5.5%/yr] and 0.29 mu g Hg/m(2).yr [17%/yr], respectively (p < 0.01). Average annual precipitation depth showed a nonsignificant increase of 0.25 cm/yr [0.4%/yr] for the period. Differences in precipitation depth, mercury concentrations, and wet mercury deposition among sites were noted. Methylmercury wet deposition, measured in 36 weekly samples, averaged about 0.18 ng/L [1.5% of total mercury] in rain and strongly correlated with total mercury, major ions, and precipitation depth.																			0013-936X	1520-5851				OCT 1	1999	33	19					3303	3312		10.1021/es9806736	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es9806736													WOS:000082881100022

The inorganic P fraction concentrations of the sediment sample were analyzed after incubation.ResultsThe sum of the four inorganic P fractions was significantly higher in the non-rainy season than in the rainy season. The P fractions with the highest concentrations, reductant soluble P- and Ca-bounded P, were also higher in the non-rainy season than in the rainy season. From the incubation experiment, it was observed that the concentration of inorganic P in the sediments tends to decrease with the incubation time in the non-rainy season resulting in the significant correlation between changes in Al- and Fe-bounded P in the sediment and PO4-P concentration in the overlying water layer. Sediments of three weirs were dominantly affected by non-point sources as indicated by EF (enrichment factor) value using P fractions. The Al-bounded P release rate was positively correlated with the pH, while those of the Fe- and Ca-bonded P were correlated with the organic matter.ConclusionThe fractionation and release of P in the sediments was affected by the rainfall and physiochemical factors. The results of this study will enhance our understanding of the water quality, as well as the effects of impoundment and rainfall on sediment, thereby aiding in an efficient management of the river environment.						oh, haeseong/0000-0001-7599-9777; Choi, Jung Hyun/0000-0003-0884-696X													1439-0108	1614-7480				MAY	2023	23	5					2284	2297		10.1007/s11368-023-03459-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-023-03459-1		APR 2023											WOS:000963017300001

Dissipation of environmental DDT and its metabolites in selected rivers of south-western Kenya	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												Rivers are the main source of domestic and industrial water supplies in Kenya. In this study, water sampling was done at eight upstream sites in the Kuja River catchment, Kenya, between October 2016 and April 2017, specifically to test for residue levels of the organochlorine pesticide, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (p,p & PRIME;-DDT), and its degradation products, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p & PRIME;-DDE) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (p,p & PRIME;-DDD). The analysis was performed with gas chromatography coupled with electron-capture detection in an autosampler. Concentrations of these residues in the surface water samples ranged from below detection limit (BDL) to 1.1113 & mu;g l-1 in the wet season, and from BDL to 2.007 & mu;g l(-1) in the dry season. Overall, the highest mean residue concentration was for p,p & PRIME;-DDT (0.9669 & PLUSMN; 0.2994 & mu;g l(-1)). The lowest mean concentration in the dry season was that of p,p & PRIME;-DDE (0.1824 & PLUSMN; 0.0964 & mu;g l(-1)), and in the wet season it was p,p & PRIME;-DDD (0.0610 & PLUSMN; 0.0038 & mu;g l(-1)). From our results it is evident that DDT is still in use and detectable in the study area, though the mean levels detected were below the acceptable thresholds for natural water as suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO). Except for a slightly higher mean spatial distribution of the metabolite p,p & PRIME;-DDT, the resides were recorded as below the maximum admissible concentrations of pesticide residues in drinking water, as set out in WHO guidelines and by Kenya's National Environment Management Authority (NEMA). Monitoring organochlorine pesticide contamination levels in Kenya's water resources should be scaled up to leverage potential for a sustainable blue economy and in safeguarding human and environmental health.

The so-called RSAM (real-time seismic amplitude measurements) technique, used in many observatories, is a good example of extracting information from seismograms with minimal processing. Built on a similar principle, the more recent seismic amplitude ratio analysis (SARA) technique allows locating migrating seismicity at high frequency (> 2 Hz, e.g., due to dike intrusions) under certain assumptions. However, such analysis generally requires a dense distribution of stations close to the seismic sources (depending on the magnitude) and/or station sites undisturbed by human activity. In a more straightforward and qualitative approach, computing amplitude ratios between station pairs can also allow for the detection of temporal and (2D) spatial changes of volcanic activity. In this work, we adopt such a simplified approach of SARA in order to characterize seismic tremors originating from two open-vent neighboring volcanoes, Nyiragongo and Nyamulagira, in the Virunga Volcanic Province (VVP) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). In contrast with previous studies, we focus here on the low-frequency band (0.3-1 Hz), free from anthropogenic noise and sensitive to shallow volcanic tremors linked to intermittent or permanent intra-crater eruptive activity recorded through the large-aperture local network. We apply for the first time the SARA methodology for volcanic sources predominantly generating surface waves and propagating over long distances. The analysis is performed on more than two years of continuous seismic data. Seismic amplitude analysis in this frequency band is strongly influenced by the short-period microseisms originating from nearby Lake Kivu. Despite this diurnal to seasonal amplitude variability, SARA successfully detects continuous volcanic tremor activity and its arrest at both volcanoes. In light of these findings, we discuss the applicability of the method to the continuous, real-time detection, and characterization of long-period shallow volcanic tremor sources in this region.

Sampling was carried out from November 1994 to December 1995, one to three times per month, according to the season. At each sampling time, lake temperature was measured and concentrations of MTs, Cd, Hg, Zn and Cu were determined in the whole soft body and in four organs or tissue samples. A histological study was conducted simultaneously to follow the development of the gonads in relation to the reproductive cycle of this bivalve. Results showed very high fluctuations in MT concentrations over the whole year, with a maximum value measured in the middle of May and ratios of around 4 at the whole organism level between extreme MT values. The tissue compartment presenting the most important variations was the visceral mass, which contains the gonads. Metal accumulation in the organisms did not seem to be involved among the factors likely to account for these variations in MT concentrations; metal concentrations remained at low and relatively constant levels throughout the whole year. The histological study revealed one spawning period from late May to the middle of June, appearing just after the MT "peak," with maximum incubation of the embryos in the gills in late June. Because MT biosynthesis can be induced by hormonal secretions implicated during reproductive phenomena, the variations in MT concentrations appeared to be directly related to the biological cycle of this freshwater mollusc rather than to the direct or indirect effects of metal bioaccumulation.

In Patagonia, these winds control the precipitation rates at the windward side of the southern Andes, and rainfall is very sensitive to any change (strength and/or latitudinal position) in the wind belt. The present-day behavior of the SWW, also known as westerlies, is characterized by remarkable seasonality. This wind belt also varies at interannual-to-decadal time scales, associated with the influence of atmospheric phenomena such as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), respectively. Moreover, during the past few decades, the westerlies have shown an increase in their core strength influenced by changes in the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). However, what controls the long-term variability of the SWW at the high latitudes of the SH is still a matter of debate. This work statistically analyzes the influence of large-scale modes of variability, such as ENSO and PDO on the SAM and the frequency of the strong SWW from ERA5 reanalysis data of southwestern Patagonia (similar to 51 degrees S), where the current core of this belt is located. Our results confirm the relation between strong wind anomalies and the SAM. In addition, the temporal variations of strong winds are also significantly affected by the PDO, but there is no detectable influence of the ENSO on their frequency. This shows that future studies focused on reconstructing wind history from aeolian particles of lake sediments from southwestern Patagonia could also provide information about the modes of variability that influence strong wind frequency.

J	Olaka, L; Ebinger, CJ				Olaka, Lydia; Ebinger, Cynthia J.			Tectonic and Paleoclimatic Setting for Hominin Evolution in Eastern Africa	ELEMENTS												As dynamic processes in the Earth's mantle stretch and thin large sectors of the African plate, broad plateaus interrupted by deep valleys and flanking mountains have formed at the Earth's surface. These vertical and horizontal crustal movements occur concurrent with global climate changes, both of which happen over diverse spatial and temporal scales. Together, they modulated eastern Africa's habitats for early hominins, and for flora and fauna in general. The habitat for hominin evolution, therefore, is shaped by bottomup and top-down processes. Broad plateau uplift in Ethiopia had initiated by 30 Ma, coincident with or after flood magmatism at 45 Ma when dry seasonal woodland environments initiated in eastern Africa. The fossil-rich sedimentary sequences partially filling the 30-70-km-wide rift basins record the history of human evolution, as well as the complex interplay between climate change, uplift, volcanism, and faulting in equatorial Africa. The lake shorelines and hydrothermal systems served as oases for hunter-gatherers, and the rough topography of the faulted landscape may have served as refugia. Here, we outline the relevant time-space patterns to establish the geodynamic and paleoclimatic context for human evolution in eastern Africa.																			1811-5209	1811-5217				APR	2023	19	2					82	87		10.2138/gselements.19.2.82	http://dx.doi.org/10.2138/gselements.19.2.82													WOS:001030465500004

Removal of alien fish through intensive fishing is cost-intensive and difficult to achieve in productive lakes. Lake Sulzkarsee is the only lake in the National Park Gesause, Austria, and was an important breeding site for amphibians until the lake was stocked with fish in the late 1970s. Salmonids were eradicated in 2005, but the lake remained degraded by the introduced minnows (Phoxinus sp.). In 2018, the lake was drained through a siphon pipe and then by pumping out water with dirt water pumps. The deepest part was treated with slaked lime, but several hundred adult minnows survived in sediment crevices and reproduced in the following season. After drainage, the phytoplankton biomass increased. Indicator species, such as Daphnia longispina and amphibians, showed signs of recovery, but they went back to an impacted state when minnows recovered after the failed eradication attempt. Purse seines proved to be the most efficient gear to catch minnows. These results indicate that deep mountain lakes are difficult to drain efficiently. Sediment treatment is required to eliminate all fish.

P.; Pourghasemi, Hamid Reza			Uncovering the Depletion Patterns of Inland Water Bodies via Remote Sensing, Data Mining, and Statistical Analysis	WATER												Addressing the issue of shrinking saline lakes around the globe has turned into one of the most pressing issues for sustainable water resource management. While it has been established that natural climate variability, human interference, climate change, or a combination of these factors can lead to the depletion of saline lakes, it is crucial to investigate each case and diagnose the potential causes of this devastating phenomenon. On that note, this study aims to promote a comprehensive analytical framework that can reveal any significant depletion patterns in lakes while analyzing the potential reasons behind these observed changes. The methodology used in this study is based on statistical analysis, data mining techniques, and remote sensing-based datasets. To achieve the objective of this study, Maharlou Lake has been selected to demonstrate the application of the proposed framework. The results revealed two types of depletion patterns in the lake's surface area: a sharp breaking point in 2007/2008 and a gradual negative trend, which was more pronounced in dry seasons and less prominent in wet seasons. Furthermore, the analysis of hydro-climatic variables has indicated the presence of abrupt and gradual changes in these variables' time series, which could be interpreted as a signal that climate change and anthropogenic drought are changing the basin's status quo. Lastly, analyzing the statistically significant correlation between hydro-climatic variables and the lake's surface area showed the potential connection between the observed changing patterns. The results obtained from data mining models suggest that Maharlou Lake has undergone a morphological transformation and is currently adopting these new conditions. If preventive measures are not taken to revive Maharlou Lake, the tipping point might have been reached, and reviving the lake could be improbable, if not impossible.					; Nasab, Mohsen/S-3438-2019; Pourghasemi, Hamid/G-9926-2014; Zolghadr-Asli, Babak/L-4853-2019; Pourghasemi, Hamid Reza/G-9926-2014; Naghdyzadegan Jahromi, Mojtaba/HDL-9301-2022	Naghdyzadegan Jahromi, Mojtaba/0000-0002-1027-4318; Tiefenbacher, John/0000-0001-9342-6550; Zolghadr-Asli, Babak/0000-0002-3392-2672; Enayati, Maedeh/0000-0001-5803-8931; Tahmasebi Nasab, Mohsen/0000-0003-2143-9955; Pourghasemi, Hamid Reza/0000-0003-2328-2998; 														2073-4441				APR	2023	15	8							1508	10.3390/w15081508	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15081508													WOS:000979421600001

Siddik; Tasdemir, Yucel			The determination of gas phase dry deposition fluxes and mass transfer coefficients (MTCs) of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) using a modified water surface sampler (WSS)	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Gas phase PCB dry deposition and concentration samples were collected simultaneously between July 2004 and May 2005 at a suburban site in Bursa, Turkey. A modified water surface sampler (WSS) was employed to collect gas phase fluxes while a high-volume air sampler (HVAS) was used for concentration samples. The WSS was able to collect both particle and gas phase PCB deposition samples. The collected PCBs on water surface were captured by a filter and an XAD-2 resin column during water cycle. The average of gas phase PCB deposition flux, determined by analyzing the XAD-2 resin column, was 79.3 +/- 40.5 ng m(-2) d(-1) and its percentage in total (gas+particle) PCB flux was about 60. The average of gas phase PCB concentration measured concurrently with flux samples was 224.4 +/- 160.2 pg m(-3) and its ratio to the total (gas+particle) PCB concentration was 85%. This difference was likely due to the different deposition characteristics of gases and particulates. Dominant PCB homolog groups were 3-4 chlorobiphenyls (CBs) for both ambient air and gas phase deposition samples. Mass transfer coefficients (MTC, K-g) for air-side were determined using gas phase flux and ambient air concentration values. The average overall K-g ranged between 0.21 and 0.96 cm.s(-1) with an average of 0.60 +/- 0.19 cm s(-1) (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The region around the lake is characterised by strong and persistent southeast winds during the four months dry season, lasting from May to August. The associated wind-stress causes the tilting of the thermocline which oscillates for the whole year. The wavelet transform spectra of temperature at 30 m depth of the lake near Mpulungu indicates the presence of various scales of motion, localised in frequency and time. The dominant modes of thermocline oscillations are intraseasonal variability with 3-4 weeks periods. Similar results are obtained from a reduced-gravity model with various wind forcing, including the observed forcing, and a simple analytical solution. In addition, the model results indicates that the dominant mode of oscillation exhibits one node only. From the study, it is inferred that the free modes of oscillations of the lake are in resonance with wind pulses.					; Plisnier, Pierre-Denis/ABG-2933-2020; Deleersnijder, Eric/AAE-7020-2020	Deleersnijder, Eric/0000-0003-0346-9667; 													0094-8276					DEC 4	2002	29	23							2093	10.1029/2002GL015843	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2002GL015843													WOS:000181064500003
J	Ingram, BL				Ingram, BL			Differences in radiocarbon age between shell and charcoal from a Holocene shellmound in northern California	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												The West Berkeley shellmound, the oldest well-dated archaeological site in the San Francisco Bay region, contains shell and charcoal ranging in age from ca. 1200 to 5700 cal yr B.P. Radiocarbon bon ages of marine shell and charcoal collected from fifteen stratigraphic levels in the West Berkeley shellmound suggest changes in the C-14 content of San Francisco Bay surface waters relative to the atmosphere (the oceanic reservoir age) over the past 5000 yr. The reservoir age of San Francisco Play waters fluctuated between 870 and -170 C-14 yr over the past 5000 yr, with the lowest values occurring 2900 to 3800 cal yr B.P. and the highest values between 1200 and 2000 cal yr B.P. Changes in the radiocarbon reservoir age may be due to changes in the strength of seasonal wind-driven upwelling off coastal California, where upwelling brings C-14-depleted waters to the surface. The period of lowest Delta R values (at 3500 to 3900 cal yr B.P.) is coincident with relatively low salinity in San Francisco Bay (indicating high freshwater inflow) and wet climate in California based on lake level records. The period of high Delta R values (1200-2000 cal yr B.P.) is coincident with one of the driest periods in California during the late Holocene. These data suggest a link between coastal upwelling and precipitation over central California The age of the top of West Berkeley mound and several other mounds in the San Francisco Bay region (1100 to 1300 cal yr B.P.) coincides with a prolonged dry period in California and low river inflow to San Francisco Bay. Perhaps the sites were abandoned because of the drought.

To reveal underlying mechanisms, roach and perch habitat use were analysed on a diel and seasonal scale, and piscivorous fish predation was quantified in one of those lakes, Lake Grosser Vatersee (Brandenburg). For the latter point, piscivorous and non-piscivorous fish population sizes were assessed by multiple mark-recapture experiments and piscivorous consumption was quantified by bioenergetics modelling. Piscivorous fish biomass accounted for about 30% of total fish biomass, and top-down control of third trophic level biomass was intense. Fish habitat shifts closely linked the littoral and pelagic habitat, and were an integral component of the fish species interactions. While pike predation was mainly restricted to the littoral zone, piscivorous perch foraged in the open water during daytime. Roach greater than or equal to age-1 counteracted the pelagic predation risk by diel horizontal migrations. So they could prey on pelagic zooplankton, and at the same time kept their predation risk in the pelagic zone as low as possible. In the littoral zone, roach extensively used non-animal resources not accessible to perch. Non-piscivorous perch were almost exclusively restricted to the littoral habitat; only age-0 perch had an initial pelagic stage. They didn't experience a juvenile competitive bottleneck. Overall, perch were relatively more affected by piscivorous fish predation than roach. This might be decisive for roach dominance under mesotrophic conditions. Additionally, Orconectes limosus, an introduced crayfish species, played a decisive role both as alternative prey for piscivorous fish and as a potential structuring force in the littoral habitat.																			0075-9511	1873-5851				MAY	2002	32	1					1	13		10.1016/S0075-9511(02)80011-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0075-9511(02)80011-1													WOS:000178729800001

Hydrogeologic controls on lake level: a case study at Mountain Lake, Virginia, USA	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Mountain Lake in Giles County, Virginia, USA, has a documented history of severe natural lake-level changes involving groundwater seepage that extends over the past 4,200 years. The natural lake was full during a large part of the twentieth century but dried up completely in September 2008 and levels have yet to recover. The objective of the study was to understand the hydrogeologic factors that influence lake-level changes using a daily water balance, electrical resistivity, water sampling and geochemical analysis, and well logging. Results from the water balance demonstrate the seasonal response to precipitation of a forested first-order drainage system in fractured rock. The resistivity surveys suggest discrete high-permeability areas may provide pathways for lake drainage. Imagery, well logs, and field observations appear to confirm the presence of a fault which crosses the Eastern Continental Divide to the east of the lake that had not previously been discussed in literature on the lake; the position of the lake within local and intermediate groundwater flow systems is considered. Historical data suggest that either significant precipitation or artificial intervention to mitigate seepage would be required for lake-level recovery in the near future.																			1431-2174	1435-0157				SEP	2012	20	6					1149	1167		10.1007/s10040-012-0859-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-012-0859-x													WOS:000308441100009

This study investigates shifts in the eastern boundary of rainforest taxa during the Late Glacial and Holocene periods. Continuous sections of highly organic sediments with several interbedded tephra layers were obtained at El Laguito del Morro Lake (41 degrees 32' 24.4" S, 71 degrees 47' 50.0" W), which were analyzed for pollen and macro charcoal. Additional macrofossil analysis was conducted to support the interpretations of pollen data and gain reliable ma-terial for radiocarbon dating. Fluctuations in regional precipitation were inferred from changes in the adjacent peatbog. The pollen record documents five distinct periods of forest diversity and structure. Late Glacial and early Holocene vegetation were characterized by a combination of Podocarpus and Cupres-saceae pollen which has no modern analogue. Taxa in question became rare, and or gradually dis-appeared around 10,300 cal yr BP when Nothofagus dombeyi type pollen increases but fluctuates. With the overall decline of charcoal concentrations around 7500 cal. BP Nothofagus dombeyi-type pollen stabilizes and dominates the diagram. After the rise in charcoal concentrations around 4000 cal yr BP also the overall vegetation composition changes around 3600 cal yr BP, with the rise of Cupressaceae pollen attributed to Austrocedrus chilensis marking the establishment of the modern vegetation structure. The last stronger change in vegetation composition is characterized by the expansion of the shrub Discaria sp. 770 cal yr BP. Charcoal and pollen data show a clear link between changes in fire regime and vegetation composition, however, changes in climate were most likely the main driver for both. During the Late Glacial period, a rainforest developed under cool temperatures and high moisture. Severity of fires decreased during a cold reversal period from ca. 12,800 to 11,300 cal yr BP. During Early Holocene, increased seasonality, volcanism-derived disturbances, and low-frequency surficial fires, enhanced Nothofagus dombeyi forest establishment. The expansion of the mixed Nothofagus dombeyi- Austrocedrus chilensis forest occurred under increased precipitation variability and the increase of low severity fires related to the establishment of El Ni ($$) over tilde no Southern Oscillation and the Southern Annular Mode during the Late Holocene. Scrub expansion occurred during historical times because of induced fires. (c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study, the suitability and sensitivity of cytokine responses, interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in gill tissues of Capoeta umbla (Heckel, 1843), collected from different regions, as early warning indices of environmental pollution and ecosystem health was evaluated. Fish and water samples were taken from ten stations in March and September 2011 and 2012. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-6 levels were determined in samples of the gill tissues by using an ELISA kit. Significant variations of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-6 levels observed between stations and seasons. The results of this study show that seasonal variations of cytokine responses in gills of Capoeta umbla are sensitive to the contaminants present in Uzuncayir Dam Lake (Tunceli, Turkey) water and are valuable biomarkers for environmental pollution and ecosystem health.

Identification of subannual patterns in microbial community signatures from individual sedimentary laminae using a freeze-coring approach	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Discrete biological community signatures were identified in individual sub-annually deposited sedimentary laminae of anoxic lake sediments from two lakes in the Minneapolis-St. Paul (Minnesota, U.S.A.) urban area. Recognizing variation in microbial communities associated with discrete millimeter scale sedimentary horizons was made possible using a freeze-coring method to recover bacterial DNA for amplicon iTag sequencing and Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism analyses. Variation in 16S rRNA gene composition between laminae suggests that seasonal changes in cell transport from the water column impart a residual molecular signature on subsurface communities. Direct comparison of frozen-in-situ core samples to ambient temperature sediment indicates that freeze coring methodology imposes no significant bias on DNA-based community fingerprints. This work further supports previous observations demonstrating the efficacy of freeze coring for high-resolution analysis of microbial communities, but here it is applied to resolving molecular signatures derived from sedimentary laminae.

Factors structuring the fish community in the area of the Coaracy Nunes hydroelectric reservoir in Amapa, northern Brazil	TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE												The objective of this study was to document the structure of the fish assemblages found in the aquatic environments affected by the Coaracy Nunes hydroelectric reservoir in Ferreira-Gomes, Amapa (Brazil) and the principal factors that determine this structure. In order to do this, standardized samples were collected of the fauna and the environmental parameters in the four principal sectors of the reservoir (upstream, the reservoir, the lake, and downstream). Fish species richness, abundance, and biomass were estimated for each sector. The abundance data were analyzed using null models of co-occurrence. A multivariate BIO-ENV analysis was used to examine the relationship between biological and environmental factors. The relationship between species richness and biomass of both prey and predator species was analyzed to determine whether predation was affecting community structure. Size spectrum analysis was conducted to verify whether fishing has influenced community structure. The results indicated contrasting seasonal patterns of deterministic processes in the downstream and lake sectors, suggesting that competition or abiotic factors may play a role in community structure. Stochastic patterns were recorded in the other sectors. Environmental factors, such as water transparency and depth, and the reservoir level were also closely related to the relative abundance of species in the communities. The relationship between the species richness and the biomass of predators and prey indicated that predation was an important determinant of community structure, which was interrupted by selective fishing. Despite the stochastic nature of most processes, deterministic factors were fundamental to the structure of the assemblages found in the downstream and lake sectors.					; Isaac, Victoria/I-2220-2013	Ferrari, Stephen/0000-0003-0566-0000; 													1940-0829					MAR	2016	9	1					16	33		10.1177/194008291600900103	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/194008291600900103													WOS:000373295900003

Based on two mesocosm experiments and 10 in vitro predation experiments, this work aimed to evaluate the impact of nutrient supply and Chaoborus predation on the structure of the zooplankton community in a small reservoir in Cote d'Ivoire. 2. During the first mesocosm experiment (M1), P enrichment had no effect on phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll a) but significantly increased the biomass of some herbivorous zooplankton species (Filinia sp, Ceriodaphnia affinis). During the second experiment (M2), N and P enrichment greatly increased phytoplankton biomass, rotifers and cladocerans (C. affinis, C. cornuta, Moina micrura and Diaphanosoma excisum). In both experiments, nutrient addition had a negative impact on cyclopoid copepods. 3. Larger zooplankton, such as cladocerans or copepodites and adults of Thermocyclops sp., were significantly reduced in enclosures with Chaoborus in both mesocosm experiments, whereas there was no significant reduction of rotifers and copepod nauplii. This selective predation by Chaoborus shaped the zooplankton community and modified its size structure. In addition, a significant Chaoborus effect on chlorophyll a was shown in both experiments. 4. The preference of Chaoborus for larger prey was confirmed in the predation experiments. Cladocerans D. excisum and M. micrura were the most selected prey. Rotifer abundance was not significantly reduced in any of the 10 experiments performed. 5. In conclusion, both bottom-up and top-down factors may exert a structuring control on the zooplankton community. Nutrients favoured more strictly herbivorous taxa and disadvantaged the cyclopoid copepods. Chaoborus predation had a strong direct negative impact on larger crustaceans, favoured small herbivores (rotifer, nauplii) and seemed to cascade down to phytoplankton.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				AUG	2003	48	8					1379	1395		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.01096.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.01096.x													WOS:000184203500007

Since 2017, protection and rescue actions have been implemented in the Erhai Lake basin which significantly improved the water quality of Erhai Lake. But little attention has been paid to the interception effects of these actions on NSP. Based on high resolution datasets, including refinement land use/land cover (LU/LC) data, China Meteorological Assimilation Driving Database for the SWAT (CMADS), and Advanced Land Observing Satellite-1 (ALOS-12) data, the interception effects of ecological ponds newly built in 2018 on NSP was discussed with the support of the soil and water assessment (SWAT) model. These three high resolution datasets can meet the needs for simulating NSP by SWAT model, which was conductive to better reveal the interception effects of ecological ponds on NSP. Besides, the pollution load of shrubbery on Total nitrogen (TN)/Total phosphorous (TP), which has never been involved in similar research works in the Erhai Lake basin, was measured. Compared the temporal and spatial variations in TN/TP concentration before and after 2018, the interception effects of ecological ponds on NSP in the Erhai Lake basin were revealed by a sharp decrease in TN/TP concentration and a delayed presence of annual peak value about 1 month late in TN concentration before and after 2018. The interception intensity of NSP was determined by the number and volume of ecological ponds in each sub-basin and their corresponding upstream.

To determine the level of environmental impact caused by an intensive aquaculture season of rainbow trout (Onchorhynchus mykiss) in floating cage systems in water nutrients and benthic macroinvertebrates in Lake Guamuez. Materials and methods. The study was developed in three areas of Lake Guamuez (two floating cage facilities and one control point). Three sampling stations with depths of 0, 10 and 20 meters were taken in each area, in order to perform measurements of total phosphorus, nitrites, nitrates and phosphates. Also, dives were carried out to a depth of approximately 20 meters, collecting sediment samples for the identification of macroinvertebrates. The environmental impact was evaluated by the relationship of the mentioned variables, using discriminant analysis and analysis of variance, previous verification of the statistical assumptions. Results. The nitrite, nitrate, phosphate and total phosphorus nutrients present significant differences (p<0.05) among all areas and only at some sampling depths. In addition, seven families of macroinvertebrates (Chironomidae, Thiaridae, Ampullariidae, Planaridae and Tubificidae indicative of contaminated and moderately contaminated waters and Hydrobiosidae and Hydrachnidae indicating good water quality) were collected. Conclusions. In the culture cages unlike the control point, higher nutrient content values were evidenced; the families of macroinvertebrates indicating contaminated or moderately contaminated water were also found. However, the results found are not found in risk limits for the lacustrine system or for the animals of culture.																			0122-0268					DEC	2018	23			S			7035	7047		10.21897/rmvz.1429	http://dx.doi.org/10.21897/rmvz.1429													WOS:000475304400011

Within versus between-lake variability of sedimentary diatoms: the role of sampling effort in capturing assemblage composition in environmentally heterogeneous shallow lakes	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												The effect of within-lake diatom assemblages variability on sample representativity and its subsequent impact on between-lake comparisons were addressed in three environmentally heterogeneous shallow lakes from the Argentinean Pampas. Surface sediment samples were collected from the open waters and the highly vegetated littoral areas on a seasonal basis and analyzed for diatom assemblages composition. Within-lake variability was assessed by comparing the Bray Curtis distances between original data and the Monte Carlo-simulated average assemblages composition through non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). Diatom assemblages showed a high variability in composition, evidencing large dispersions of samples around the centroid in NMDS plots. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance tests signaled significant differences in average composition between the three lakes, related mainly to their differences in conductivity and depth. Representativity of original samples was assessed through principal coordinates analyses ordinations of the three lakes, being samples lying in the overlapping areas of the plot classified as poor representatives of between-lake differences. Several samples, both from littoral and open waters, were classified as poor representatives through this method. Simulation allowed us to evaluate the effect of sample replication on improving between-lake comparisons, and showed that collecting two littoral and two open-water samples allowed us to faithfully capture differences in average composition among the three lakes. Hence, the results suggest that using a single sample to estimate diatom assemblages composition in these lakes should be avoided, as it fails to capture between-lake differences, leading to biases in compositional comparisons among lakes and regions. Consequently, including multiple samples from each lake when constructing calibration sets would be the best option to obtain reliable paleoenvironmental reconstructions from single sediment cores in these environmentally heterogeneous shallow lakes.

Reservoir operation and environmental water demand: Scenarios for the Sub-Middle and Lower Sao Francisco River basin, Brazil	ECOHYDROLOGY												Water management is important for delivering water for different users and uses. Reservoirs are built to overcome the stochastic nature of river flows and to increase the reliability of water supply. Reservoir operation affects the ecology of downstream river sections, and there has been a discussion of a more ecologically oriented flow regime, although ecosystems of reservoirs themselves are rarely taken into account. For reservoirs, it is important to identify multiple impacts and trade-offs of different management options. This information can be used in a multidisciplinary and multiparticipatory decision-making process to assess the management options. This study develops, applies, and discusses reservoir operation options for the Sao Francisco River basin (Brazil): (a) Reference; (b) Environmental discharge; (c) Reduced daily water-level variation; and (d) Reduced annual water-level variation. In the simulation study, the operation option with reduced daily water-level variation in reservoirs turned out to be the most flexible, guaranteeing hydropower generation and water supply in the dry season, while considering the ecology of the reservoirs and rivers. The simulations are exemplary for decision makers, requiring further assessment after agreeing on priority setting.

Operational, environmental, and resource productivity factors driving spatial distribution of gillnet and longline fishers targeting Nile-perch (Lates niloticus), Lake Victoria	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH					African Great Lakes Conference (AGLC) - Conservation and Development in a Changing Climate	MAY, 2017	Entebbe, UGANDA					Operational and environmental factors limited available resource space of gillnet and longline fishers targeting Nile perch in the Speke gulf and open lake of southern Lake Victoria and drove their encounter rates with patches of fish resulting in gear specific distributional patterns. Catch-rate patterns were similar by region and gear: large (>50 cm) Nile-perch densities increased over distance from homeport and deeper in the water column while small Nile perch (<50 cm) densities decreased. Effects of season, (setting) depth and region were present but small and obscured by high variation in daily catch-rates and individual fisher strategies. Both fisheries distributed themselves over the size-productivity spectrum of Nile perch but reacted differently to patterns in size distribution of Nile perch: gillnetters focused more on numbers of productive juveniles between 30 and 60 cm at on average 5 km distance (59 min travel time) from homeport and longliners on larger sized 40-80 cm Nile perch deeper in the water column at 7 km (108 min). Sampled fishers likely were representative of most of the Nile perch fisheries. If so, this means that fishing pressure is mainly exerted on nearshore lake areas, and more lightly fished offshore areas may act as a refuge for adult Nile perch. Total catch-rates by gear were generally equalized over the resource space, increasing slightly with distance from homeport, according to ideal free distribution predictions. Nile perch fishers on Lake Victoria appear to distribute themselves according to the underlying productivity distribution of the resource within the constraints of their available resource space.

J	Gooseff, MN; Mcknight, DM; Runkel, RL				Gooseff, MN; Mcknight, DM; Runkel, RL			Reach-scale cation exchange controls on major ion chemistry of an Antarctic glacial meltwater stream	AQUATIC GEOCHEMISTRY												The McMurdo dry valleys of Antarctica represent the largest of the ice-free areas on the Antarctic continent, containing glaciers, meltwater streams, and closed basin lakes. Previous geochemical studies of dry valley streams and lakes have addressed chemical weathering reactions of hyporheic substrate and geochemical evolution of dry valley surface waters. We examine cation transport and exchange reactions during a stream tracer experiment in a dry valley glacial meltwater stream. The injection solution was composed of dissolved Li+, Na+, K+, and Cl-. Chloride behaved conservatively in this stream, but Li+, Na+, and K+ were reactive to varying degrees. Mass balance analysis indicates that relative to Cl-, Li+ and K+ were taken up in downstream transport and Na+ was released. Simulations of conservative and reactive (first-order uptake or generation) solute transport were made with the OTIS (one-dimensional solute transport with inflow and storage) model. Among the four experimental reaches of Green Creek, solute transport simulations reveal that Li+ was removed from stream water in all four reaches, K+ was released in two reaches, taken up in one reach, and Na+ was released in all four reaches. Hyporheic sediments appear to be variable with uptake of Li+ in two reaches, uptake of K+ in one reach, release of K+ in two reaches, and uptake of Na+ in one reach. Mass balances of the conservative and reactive simulations show that from 1.05 to 2.19 moles of Li+ was adsorbed per reach, but less than 0.3 moles of K+ and less than 0.9 moles of Na+ were released per reach. This suggests that either ( 1) exchange of another ion which was not analyzed in this experiment or ( 2) that both ion exchange and sorption control inorganic solute transport. The elevated cation concentrations introduced during the experiment are typical of initial flows in each flow season, which flush accumulated dry salts from the streambed. We propose that the bed sediments ( which compose the hyporheic zone) modulate the flushing of these salts during initial flows each season, due to ion exchange and sorption reactions.

J	Banse, K				Banse, K			Steemann Nielsen and the zooplankton	HYDROBIOLOGIA												E. Steemann Nielsen is remembered by most biological oceanographers and limnologists as having introduced the C-14 method for measuring photosynthesis in 1952. The present paper is to recall that he was interested in the phytoplankton as part of the plankton community and was much aware of the role of grazing in affecting, if not determining, the concentrations of phytoplankton and, thus, also its rate of production. His principal statements to this effect were made with the open, oligotrophic subtropical and tropical oceans in mind where phytoplankton concentrations exhibit little seasonal change. This paper shows that Steemann Nielsen's sentiment also applies to non-static situations, especially phytoplankton blooms. Of the blooms in Cushing's North Sea Calanus patches of 1949 and 1954 and the two low-latitude, open-sea iron fertilization experiments (IronEx I, II) of the 1990s, more than half or even most of the newly formed cells were lost daily. In these examples, the same water was revisited, mixing was considered, and sinking was an unimportant loss term, so that grazing was the principal cause of mortality. Because of the grazing losses and the subsequent regeneration the CO2 draw down in the fertilized water was much lower than the 14 C uptake. Moreover the examples show that over the course of the blooms, the rate and even the sign of temporal change of phytoplankton abundance had little relation to the rate of cell division, as already postulated by Riley's 1946 model of the seasonal cycle of phytoplankton on Georges Bank. Thus, in most situations in the open sea and, presumably, large lakes, the rates of cell division (instead of photosynthesis by itself) and of mortality (most often from grazing) are needed for understanding and predicting the temporal change of phytoplankton abundance, a principal goal of biological oceanography. The mechanism maintaining the actual abundance of phytoplankton in the quasi-steady state prevailing over most of the ocean much of the time is still unclear.																			0018-8158					JUL	2002	480	1-3					15	28		10.1023/A:1021220714899	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1021220714899													WOS:000179387300003
J	Khadkikar, AS; Sant, DA; Gogte, V; Karanth, RV				Khadkikar, AS; Sant, DA; Gogte, V; Karanth, RV			The influence of Deccan volcanism on climate: insights from lacustrine intertrappean deposits, Anjar, western India	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												A sedimentary succession from Anjar sandwiched between basaltic flows records what transpired as continental India passed from Cretaceous to Tertiary times in the immediate vicinity of the Deccan Trap Province. The deposits consist of interlayered peloidal cherty limestones and shales. The shales are dominated by the mineral sepiolite. Chert occurs as three varieties. These include an amorphous cement, microcrystalline quartz and chalcedony. The last two usually fill gastropodal chambers and peloids. These sediments are interpreted as being deposited in an alkaline closed-basin lake that periodically received silica-saturated hydrothermal solutions. The lake in spite of having fluctuating shorelines was perennial. This wave-dominated lake was highly productive biogenically which is evident in the abundance of molluscan shell debris. Based on the sedimentological characteristics the site appears to be located proximal to the palaeo-shoreline. The palaeolatitude position of India during the Maastrichtian would suggest a sub-humid to humid, seasonal climate in Kachchh. A semi-arid climate is inferred on the basis of the lake deposits for Anjar This apparent contradiction is believed to be due to 'mock aridity'. This term is used to explain volcanically influenced climates that mimic characters of xeric semi-arid climates. Similar signatures of semi-aridity in the Indian Peninsula are observed in calcic palaeosols of the contemporaneous Lameta Formation sediments around Jabalpur. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Paz, JDS; Rossetti, DF				Paz, JDS; Rossetti, DF			Linking lacustrine cycles with syn-sedimentary tectonic episodes: An example from the Codo Formation (late Aptian), northeastern Brazil	GEOLOGICAL MAGAZINE												The Codo Formation exposed in the eastern Grajau Basin, northeastern Brazil, consists mostly of black shales, limestones and evaporites arranged into several shallowing- upward cycles formed by progradation of lake deposits. Three ranks of cycles are distinguished. The lower-rank cycles correspond to millimetric interbeddings of: bituminous black shales with evaporites, calcimud-stones or peloidal wackestone-packstone; grey/green shale with calcimudstone, peloidal wackestone-packstone or ostracodal wackestone/grainstone; and ostracodal wackestone/grainstone and/or calcimudstones with cryptomicrobial mats and ooidal/pisoidal packstones. The intermediate-rank cycles average 1.7 m in thickness and are formed by complete and incomplete cycles. Complete cycles show a transition from central to intermediate and then to marginal facies associations and include two types: C1 cycle with central lake deposits consisting of evaporites and black shales; and C2 cycle with central lake deposits formed by grey/green shale. Complete cycles were produced by the upward gradation from central to marginal environments of the lake or saline pan-sabkha system. Incomplete cycles are those where at least one facies association is lacking, having been formed by successions either with central and intermediate facies associations (11) or intermediate and marginal facies associations (12). The higher-rank cycles are, on average, 5.2 m thick and consist of four depositional units that display shallowing-upward successions formed by complete and incomplete intermediate-rank cycles that vary their distribution upward in the section, and are bounded by sharp surfaces. While the lower-rank cycles display characteristics that reveal their seasonal signature, detailed sedimentological characterization and understanding of stratal stacking patterns related to the intermediate- and higher-rank cycles support a genesis linked to syn-sedimentary tectonic activity. This is particularly suggested by the high facies variability, limited lateral extension, and frequent and random thickness changes of the intermediate-rank cycles. Additionally, the four higher-rank cycles recognized in the Codo Formation match with stratigraphic zones having different styles of soft-sediment deformation structures attributed to seismic activities. Therefore, the several episodes of lake shallowing recorded in the Codo Formation are linked to seismic pulses that alternated with sediment deposition. This process would have created significant changes in the lake water level and resulted in sharply bounded successions with upward gradation from deeper to relatively shallower facies associations.

In this study we predict stream sensitivity to non-point source pollution based on the non-linear responses of hydrological regimes and associated loadings of non-point source pollutants to catchment properties. We assessed two hydrologically based thresholds of impairment, one for catchment storage (5-10%) and one for mature forest (<50% versus >60% of catchment in mature forest cover) across two different hydrogeomorphic regions within the Northern Lakes and Forest (NLF) ecoregion: the North Shore [predominantly within the North Shore Highlands Ecological Unit] and the South Shore (predominantly within the Lake Superior Clay Plain Ecological Unit). Water quality samples were collected and analysed during peak snowmelt and baseflow conditions from 24 second-order streams grouped as follows: three in each region x catchment storage x mature forest class. 2. Water quality was affected by a combination of regional influences, catchment storage and mature forest. Regional differences were significant for suspended solids, phosphorus, nitrogen: phosphorus ratios, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and alkalinity. Catchment storage was significantly correlated with dissolved silica during the early to mid-growing season, and with DOC, specific conductance and alkalinity during all seasons. Total nitrogen and dissolved nitrogen were consistently less in low mature forest than in high mature forest catchments. Catchment storage interacted with the influence of mature forest for only two metrics: colour and the soluble inorganic nitrogen : phosphorus ratio. 3. Significant interaction terms (region by mature forest or region by storage) suggest differences in regional sensitivity for conductance, alkalinity, total organic carbon, and colour, as well as possible shifts in thresholds of impact across region or mature forest class. 4. Use of the NLF Ecoregion alone as a basis for setting regional water quality criteria would lead to the misinterpretation of reference condition and assessment of condition. There were pronounced differences in background water quality between the North and South Shore streams, particularly for parameters related to differences in soil parent material and glacial history. A stratified random sampling design for baseflow and snowmelt stream water quality based on both hydrogeomorphic region and catchment attributes improves assessments of both reference condition and differences in regional sensitivity.																			0046-5070					MAY	2003	48	5					912	927		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.01056.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.01056.x													WOS:000182183600013

Bacteria (887) were isolated on tryptic soy broth agar and identified to 48 genera using fatty acid methyl ester analysis. The two most abundant genera isolated were Aeromonas and Pseudomonas which, respectively, dominated the middle to bottom depths in August and all depths in February. The structure of the sampled community was described using: species richness, Simpson's index and the Shannon-Wiener index. All three indices detected a number of significant differences with depth demonstrating stratification. The greatest stratification of the bacterial community was observed in August when bacterial counts correlated strongly and negatively with diversity. Using structural measures was found to be preferable to the use of species frequencies in the analysis of perturbation and succession in community structure. Insensitivity to one or more of eight antibiotics was observed in 71% (61/86) of the isolates tested particularly in Gram-negative genera. Bacteriocinogeny and lysogeny was observed in 36% (32/90) of isolates. Using sensitive indicator strains, two of 10 producing strains produced virus, while the others produced bacteriocins.

J	Bennion, H; Monteith, D; Appleby, P				Bennion, H; Monteith, D; Appleby, P			Temporal and geographical variation in lake trophic status in the English Lake District: evidence from (sub)fossil diatoms and aquatic macrophytes	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. A sediment core (representing 250-300 years) was taken from each of three lakes of conservation interest and contrasting trophic status in the English Lake District: Wastwater, Bassenthwaite Lake and Esthwaite Water. Lithostratigraphic analyses, radiometric dating and analysis of fossil diatoms were carried out. 2. Transfer functions, based on the diatoms, were used to reconstruct total phosphorus (TP) and, thus, eutrophication at the study lakes. In Wastwater, changes in lake pH were also reconstructed. 3. The lakes were also classified according to their present macrophyte flora, the latter being compared with previous records. 4. The fossil diatoms of Wastwater were continuously dominated by taxa typical of oligotrophic, circumneutral waters, indicating that the lake has not been enriched or acidified in the last 250 years. The aquatic macrophyte flora has probably remained unchanged since before the Industrial Revolution. 5. The diatom assemblages of both Bassenthwaite Lake and Esthwaite Water began to change in the mid-1800s. Further change occurred from the 1960s, at the onset of a recent period of eutrophication. These two lakes have experienced continued nutrient enrichment throughout the 1970s, 80s and 90s, largely associated with increasing phosphorus inputs from sewage effluent. There is no evidence of any recovery in response to recent reductions in external nutrient loads. 6. Only in Esthwaite Water has the change in aquatic macrophytes been pronounced. 7. Palaeolimnological reconstruction is useful in determining background conditions and natural variation in lake ecosystems.					; Bennion, Helen/T-7848-2019; Monteith, Donald/C-1534-2008	Bennion, Helen/0000-0003-0125-9308; Appleby, Peter/0000-0002-6945-1841													0046-5070					DEC	2000	45	4					394	412		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2000.00626.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2000.00626.x													WOS:000166523700003

Stature in Holocene Foragers of North India	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY												The Ganga Plain of North India provides an archaeological and skeletal record of semi-nomadic Holocene foragers in association with an aceramic Mesolithic culture. Prior estimates of stature for Mesolithic Lake Cultures (MLC) used inappropriate equations from an American White reference group and need revision. Attention is given to intralimb body proportions and geo-climatic provenance of MLC series in considering the most suitable reference population. Regression equations from ancient Egyptians are used in reconstructing stature for MLC skeletal series from Damdama (DDM), Mahadaha (MDH), and Sarai Nahar Rai (SNR). Mean stature is estimated at between 174 (MDH) and 178 cm (DDM and SNR) for males, and between 163 cm (MDH) and 179 cm (SNR) for females. Stature estimates based on ancient Egyptian equations are significantly shorter (from 3.5 to 7.1 cm shorter in males; from 3.2 to 7.5 cm shorter in females) than estimates using the American White reference group. Revised stature estimates from tibia length and from femur+tibia more accurately estimate MLC stature for two reasons: a) these elements are highly correlated with stature and have lower standard estimates of error, and b) uncertainty regarding methods of measuring tibia length is avoided. When compared with Holocene samples of native Americans and Mesolithic Europeans, MLC series from North India are tall. This aspect of their biological variation confirms earlier assessments and results from the synergistic influence of balanced nutrition from broad-spectrum foraging, body-proportions adapted to a seasonally hot and arid climate, and the functional demands of a mobile, semi-nomadic life-style.

Histological observations of gonads and otolith daily increment analyses were undertaken. Gonadal sexual dimorphism is histologically identifiable in fish larger than ca. 15 mm SL, but not easily so in smaller fish. The reproductive size of females was estimated as larger than ca. 30 mm SL for both FITS and LTS, compared with ca. 20 mm SL for males. Ages estimated from otolith daily increment counts were 37-123 days in fish collected during the HTS (14.4-38.2 mm SL), and 32-148 days during the LTS (10.0-41.3 mm SL). On the basis of growth patterns (logistic models) in the HIS and LTS [L = 36.97/(1+exp(-0.036 x (T-47.09))) for the former period, L = 40.98/(1+exp(-0.026 x (T-76.37))) for the latter], fish reached 30 mm SL (reproductive size) faster (ca. 90 days) during the HTS than in the LTS (ca. 115 days). Considering the daily ages at reproductive size and their maximum ages (123 in the HTS and 148 in the LTS) observed in the present study, P. siamensis is considered to spawn throughout the year with plural generation alternations per year. Feeding incidence rates (%) were high, 86.1% in the HTS and 92.9% in the LTS, stomach contents comprising mainly zooplankton and insect larvae. This indicated that P. siamensis is carnivorous, the habitats from which fish were sampled being rich in dietary organisms regardless of seasons. Hence, the faster growth and earlier maturation in fish during the HTS are considered to be attributable to the higher temperature of that season.

Organochlorine pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls in city drains in Makurdi, central Nigeria: Seasonal variations, source apportionment and risk assessment	HELIYON												A study of seasonal variation, sources and potential risks of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in open city drains in Makurdi, Central Nigeria was carried out. OCPs and PCBs were quantified using gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer. The total ( n-ary sumation 8OCPs) concentrations (ngL-1) of OCPs in water was 2.99 with a mean +/- SD of 0.75 +/- 0.12 during wet season, while during dry season, the values were 11.43 and 2.86 +/- 1.54 respectively. In sediment, the total concentration (ngg-1) of OCPs was 5270.66 with a mean +/- SD of 1756.89 +/- 450.01 during wet season and a total concentration of 5837.93 and the mean +/- SD of 1945.98 +/- 646.04, during dry season. Source apportionment of OCPs suggested historic application of the pollutants. The total ( n-ary sumation 7PCBs) concentration (ngL-1) of PCBs in water was 0.24 with a mean +/- SD of 0.03 +/- 0.02 during wet season and a total concentration of 0.61 with a mean +/- SD of 0.09 +/- 0.11 during dry season. The total concentration (ngg-1) of PCBs in sediment was 37.88, mean +/- SD of 5.41 +/- 5.93 during wet season and a total of 47.07 and mean +/- SD of 6.72 +/- 7.27 during dry season. Ecological risk assessment based on effect range low (ERL) and effect range median (ERM) or threshold effect level (TEL) and probable effect level (PEL) that ecological risks were possible for some OCPs in this study, which calls for source control and remediation of the affected sites. Toxicity equivalency (TEQ) of PCB-118, the dioxin-like congener, indicated that it was most harmful to humans/mammals followed by birds, then fish.																				2405-8440				MAR	2023	9	3							e14324	10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e14324	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e14324		MAR 2023						36950572					WOS:000970292400001

Effects of Greater flamingo Phoenicopterus ruber on macrophytes, chironomids and turbidity in natural marshes in Don(n)over-tildeana, SW Spain	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												Top predators and nutrient inputs are important factors determining the structure of freshwater aquatic systems. Greater flamingos (Phoenicopterus ruber) have been shown to destroy submerged macrophytes and may promote a switch from clear water to turbid water in the temporary marshes of Do (n) over tilde ana National Park. We excluded flamingos from twenty 4x4 m plots distributed between two lucios (shallow seasonal lakes) within the marshes from February to July 2004. In July, we measured total suspended solids (TSS), macrophyte biomass and abundance and size of chironomid larvae in the twenty exclosures and twenty adjacent control plots. TSS was lower and macrophyte biomass was higher in exclosures, but not significantly so. Flamingos were found to cause a significant reduction in chironomid abundance and an increase in the proportion of larger larvae. The effect of exclusion was greater where the density of flamingos was highest. Comparison with the results of previous studies suggests that the impact of flamingos is context dependent and largely determined by bird density and/or factors related to macrophyte productivity. Water levels were especially high in 2004 owing to heavy rains, and flamingos may have stronger effects in years of lower rainfall.

J	Krogerus, K; Ekholm, P				Krogerus, K; Ekholm, P			Phosphorus in settling matter and bottom sediments in lakes loaded by agriculture	HYDROBIOLOGIA												In shallow lakes, the cycling of P between water and bottom sediments is strongly influenced by wind-induced resuspension of particulate matter. The significance of this P flux as an algal nutrient source is unclear. We examined gross sedimentation in 3 open and shallow agriculturally loaded lakes. In addition, we estimated the potential P-release from settling and bottom matter by laboratory tests. The mean daily rate of gross sedimentation was 21-170 g m(-2) d(-1) of dry sediment, 0.04-0.18 g (-2) d(-1) of P and 0.18 - 2.0 g m(-2) d(-1) of N; being the highest in the shallowest and most eutrophic lake. In Lake Karhijarvi, where the most intensive measurements were taken, wind explained the temporal variation in the gross sedimentation to some extent. The settling matter consisted of inorganic particles low in nutrients, especially during peak sedimentation periods. On average, 7.7 +/- 3.1% ( x +/- 95% confidence interval) of the P in the settling matter in L. Karhijarvi was in an algal-available form according to 2 - 3 week bioassays. In the bottom matter of the three lakes, 3.0 +/- 1.7% and 2.5 +/- 3.6%, and 4.3 +/- 3.7% of the P was utilized by the algae. In L. Karhijarvi, resuspension of the potentially available P exceeded 20 times the external loading during the open water season. According to sorption tests, P is released from the bottom matter only when the concentration of o-P is < 2 μg l(-1). Although such a low value cannot be determined with common analytical procedures, it seems probable that the P concentration allows P desorption during P-limited periods. However, the significance of resuspended matter as an algal nutrient source calls for further research.

Small indigenous fish species management solely depends on their population status and conservation. This study aimed to determine the population status of Hyporhamphus limbatus, in Southwestern Bangladesh using conventional and truss morphological characteristics.ResultsA total of 174 fish samples were procured from monsoon season i.e., May to August 2018 the Bhairab River, BR; Kopotakkho River, KR; and Baluhar Baor, BB in Bangladesh. Five meristics, six conventional and twelve truss-based morphometric characters, were considered for stock identification. The Kruskal-Wallis test helped to analyze the meristic characters, while ANOVA, principal component analysis (PCA), discriminant function analysis (DFA), correct classification analysis using DFA, and a UPGMA dendrogram formation were used to investigate the conventional and truss measurements. By the Kruskal-Wallis test, no meristic characters showed significant differences across different populations. Eleven of the 18 morphometric measurements showed significant differences among three populations through the univariate ANOVA. PCA specified the population structure variations and explained 67.438% of the total variance. The first and second discrimination functions accounted for 78.3% and 21.7%, representing 100% of the group variability. Similarly, 85.6% of the grouped cases and 77.6% of cross-validated grouped cases were initially effectively represented by their correct number of individuals. A dendrogram based on morphometric (conventional and truss) displayed three stocks grouped into two clusters, with BR forming a distinct cluster, while KR and BB creating a shared cluster.ConclusionIn conclusion, such morphological differences are most likely due to their distinctive ancestral origins. This study presents novel reports on the stock assessment of H. limbatus in their natural ecosystem. Furthermore, molecular research and an evaluation of the environmental impact on H. limbatus populations in Bangladesh are strongly recommended.					; Islam, Sk Injamamul/JLM-9159-2023; Atique, Usman/Q-1454-2018	Islam, Sk Injamamul/0000-0002-0888-6075; Atique, Usman/0000-0001-9178-8443													2090-9896	2090-990X				MAR 7	2023	84	1							10	10.1186/s41936-023-00329-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s41936-023-00329-7													WOS:000945401000001

Enrique; Correa-Metrio, Alex			A millennium of anthropic and climate dynamics in the Lake Izabal Basin, eastern lowland Guatemala	REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY												Modern precipitation gradients across the Maya region in Central America result in a diverse vegetational mosaic that varies from scrub forest to rainforest. In this region, evidence of past changes in the distribution of vegetation indicates two main patterns: i) a Holocene long-term trend towards a more seasonal forest, and ii) sharp changes in vegetation cover resulting from human occupation. The history of vegetation in moister areas of the Maya re-gion, however, has been mostly extrapolated from studies carried out in the Yucatan Peninsula. We reconstructed the paleoenvironmental and paleoecological dynamics of the last-1300 years in the Lake Izabal Basin, one of the wettest areas within the Maya region. Palynological and geochemical evidences indicate that from-650-1150 CE, vegetation assemblages were dominated by disturbance taxa, under relatively low erosion in the catchment area. This pattern probably resulted from anthropogenic activities during the Terminal Classic Pe-riod (800-950 CE) combined with the dry and more seasonal conditions of the Medieval Climate Anomaly. The record from 1150 to 1400 CE points to an increase in moisture availability with a change towards a forested land-scape. From 1400 to 1950 CE, geochemical data indicate lower precipitation, while the vegetation appears less fragmented and a mature forest developed. Such pattern probably emerged from lower evapotranspiration asso-ciated with the Little Ice Age (1350-1850 CE) favoring vegetation recovery. During the last 1300 years, vegetation change in the Lake Izabal Basin parallels that of the Yucatan Peninsula, with anthropogenic influences and mois-ture availability exerting first-and second-order controls on vegetation turnover, respectively.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Accurate distributional data are particularly important for threatened or rare species with a broad geographic range and low detectability in their preferred habitats, as surveying and successfully encountering this type of species is oftentimes difficult. One such species is the eastern massasauga (Sistrurus catenatus), a smallbodied, federally threatened rattlesnake with a distribution centered around the Great Lakes region. The current status of many massasauga populations remains uncertain, hindering effective recovery efforts. We used single-season occupancy models to reassess the status of historic massasauga sites (n = 33) distributed throughout Michigan's Lower Peninsula. We assessed siteand survey-specific covariates at both the local- and landscape-scale to inform occupancy and detection probabilities. Average canopy cover best predicted occupancy probabilities, while search effort best predicted detection probabilities. Our top model which included canopy cover (occupancy) and search effort (detection) estimated an average occupancy probability of 0.30 (CI = 0.15-0.50) and average detection probability of 0.55 (CI = 0.31-0.78). Landscape-scale covariates derived from remotely-sensed data did not improve model fit for occupancy models. Our findings suggest that persistence of eastern massasauga populations relies upon canopy cover of < 60%, so management practices aimed at reducing woody invasive species, or setting back natural succession, will benefit this species. Our results may also be used to guide future survey efforts for massasaugas and have implications for current population predictions that form the basis of recovery strategies.					; Moore, Jennifer/A-1174-2008	Hileman, Eric/0000-0002-7044-370X; 														2351-9894				JUN	2023	43								e02422	10.1016/j.gecco.2023.e02422	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2023.e02422		MAR 2023											WOS:001042906700001

These cause disorientation in downstream migrating salmon and interfere with downstream passage. Structural and operational modifications such as installations of curtains, surface withdrawal, draw down, and selective withdrawal are often considered to alter the stratification and modify the currents to enhance the movement of fish toward the forebay where they may be collected effectively. Effectiveness of design modification in deep reservoirs is highly dependent on site-specific hydraulic and meteorological conditions, and numerical models are the tools of choice in design and selection of the optimum alternative. Although most hydropower reservoirs exhibit a vertical-longitudinal 2-D current structure, 3-D flow patterns are prevalent in reservoirs with multiple branches, and they occur near the power intakes as well. Simulation of these currents requires a 3-D hydrodynamic resolution. However, high-resolution hydrodynamic models, coupled with heat balance and water quality, have extensive computational demands and are unsuitable for iterative application or long-duration runs. An efficient strategy was developed where a vertical-longitudinal 2D heat balance model (BETTER) was used to generate rapid, year-long simulations of temperature and stratification in the reservoir The predicted temperature distribution provided initial conditions for focused application of the 3-D hydrodynamic model (EFDC) to predict current patterns during the fish migration seasons only. A Lagrangian particle tracking technique was used to rank the effectiveness of each alternative in terms of guiding fish to the forebay, thereby improving potential for success. Selective surface withdrawal was found to be the most effective way to improve currents for enhancement of fish passage and help manage in-lake and discharge temperatures at Round Butte Dam in Lake Billy Chinook Oregon.

J	Lezaeta, PF; Chave, AD; Evans, RL				Lezaeta, PF; Chave, AD; Evans, RL			Correction of shallow-water electromagnetic data for noise induced by instrument motion	GEOPHYSICS												An unexpected noise source has been found in magnetic- and sometimes electric-field data recorded on the bottom of lakes in the Archean Slave craton (northwestern Canada) during warm seasons. The noise is the result of instrument motion and in some instances direct induction by wind-driven surface gravity waves when the lakes are not ice covered. The noise can be reduced or eliminated by prefiltering the data with an adaptive correlation noise-canceling filter using instrument tilt records prior to estimation of magnetotelluric (MT) response functions. Similar effects are to be expected in other shallow-water environments, and the adaptive correlation canceler is a suitable method to preprocess MT data to reduce motion-related noise in the magnetic field. This underscores the importance of ancillary tilt measurements in shallow-water MT surveys. In coastal or lake-bottom surveys, special efforts to reduce hydrodynamic effects on the instrument should also be pursued.					; evans, rob/C-6887-2011	Evans, Robert/0000-0001-5585-0684; Chave, Alan/0000-0002-2460-1172; 													0016-8033	1942-2156				SEP-OCT	2005	70	5					G127	G133		10.1190/1.2080748	http://dx.doi.org/10.1190/1.2080748													WOS:000232294700010

Six species each of Microcystis and Anabaena, and two of Oscillatoria were identified in these lakes. The cyanotoxins of 47 samples collected from the lakes were identified as microcystins-RR, -YR, -LR; desmethyl-7-microcystin-LR (7-DMLR), plus anatoxin-a. Microcystins were the main components of these cyanotoxins, while anatoxin-a was detected in samples from a few lakes. Thirty-four of the 47 samples, included microcystins and the total amounts of microcystin ranged between 20-1500 mu g/g freeze-dried bloom material. In four of the 26 samples, the samples contained anatoxin-a, though the amounts varied. The total microcystin concentration in 30 samples from the lakes was equal to the cellular microcystin in these lakes because no extracellular microcystin was detected. All the lakes except for Lakes Younglang and Mijae are a source of drinking water, so the presence of cyanotoxin can be a potential threat and requires more attention to water treatment, (C) 1998 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

J	Jamu, DM; Torell, EC; Chisale, E				Jamu, Daniel M.; Torell, Elin C.; Chisale, Essau			Community-Managed Fish Sanctuaries for Freshwater Fishery Biodiversity Conservation and Productivity in Malawi	SUSTAINABILITY												Key fish breeding and other biodiverse areas in Malawian lakes are under threat from illegal fishing, the siltation of key breeding areas (due to deforestation-induced soil erosion), and the clearing of shoreline aquatic vegetation. Freshwater protected areas, also called sanctuaries, have the potential to support the restoration of degraded aquatic environments and protect fisheries' biodiversity. In Malawi, community-managed fish sanctuaries have been established by beach village committees (BVCs) throughout Lake Malawi, Lake Malombe, Lake Chilwa and Lake Chiuta. The sanctuaries were established to conserve exploited stocks, preserve biodiversity, and enhance fisheries' yield. The BVCs are aligned with local decentralized village development committees linked to District Councils. Together, they constitute a defragmented decentralized ecosystem-based management of fishery resources. A monitoring study was conducted in sanctuaries in the four lakes during the wet and dry season over three years (2016-2019). The monitoring was carried out to evaluate the sanctuaries' biological performance. The results showed that community-managed sanctuaries contributed to a 24% increase in the total number of observed species. The Shannon Diversity Index increased from an average 1.21 to 1.52. Small and mid-size (<50 ha) sanctuaries showed a higher performance improvement than large (>50 ha) sanctuaries. This is likely due to multiple factors, including a higher level of fish movement and the greater ability of communities to surveil and enforce smaller sanctuaries. The participation of communities in monitoring enhanced the demonstration effects of sanctuaries. This, in turn, encouraged communities to expand the number and size of the sanctuaries. The biological performance results indicate that community-managed freshwater sanctuaries can be used to protect and restore fish biodiversity in freshwater lakes in Africa. Linking the BVCs to defragmented decentralized structures ensures that the interconnectedness between ecosystem uses, including forestry, agriculture, and tourism, which impinge on fish productivity, are addressed holistically.

The mineralogy and geochemistry of the suspended matter and the isotopic composition (oxygen-18 and deuterium) of the river waters were studied for the first time. The dependence of the chemical and isotopic compositions of the tributary water on the season and characteristics of the catchment area (swampiness and lacustrine) was revealed. It is shown that the river waters belong to the bicarbonate class of the calcium group and have low mineralization, high color and a similar composition to the main minerals of the suspended matter. It is determined that the difference between the multielement spectra of the water and suspended matter of the different rivers is closely related to the geological and geomorphological structures of river basins. It is established that the quantitative characteristics of the mineral and organic parts of the suspended matter, the ratios of the different minerals andthe size and patterning of the particles of detrital material in the tributaries differ. The change in the mineralogical and geochemical compositions of the suspended matter of each individual river over the year is insignificant. The influence of the river runoff on the formation of lake waters is manifested in the chemical composition of the lake waters. The quantitative ratios of the main ions, biogenic elements and microcomponents in lake water mainly correspond to their ratios in river waters. The mineral part of the dispersed sedimentary matter of the lake in its geochemical characteristics is close to the suspended matter of the river waters.

The Effect of Dam Construction on the Uldza River in Mongolia on the Hydrological Regime of the Torey Lakes	GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES												Possible consequences of the construction of the Uldza River reservoir in Mongolia related to a change in the hydrological regime of the Torey Lakes and of the transboundary basin are analyzed. Climatic and hydrological characteristics of the Uldza River and the Torey Lakes are analyzed based on data of hydrological surveys of 1965-2020. It is revealed that the main factor of variability of their hydrological regimes is represented by cyclic climate changes accompanied by large temperature amplitudes, the extremely uneven distribution of precipitation over seasons and particular years, high water filtration and evaporation losses (often exceeding the local runoff), and the periodic drying up of rivers and lakes. The configuration and filling and drawdown modes under different water conditions of the designed reservoir are simulated using available material of the tender documentation for the Mongolian Onon-Ulz project, open raster data of satellite sounding of the Earth, various GIS sources, and other global data. Based on the simulation results, quantitative estimates of possible mean monthly deviations of the regulated runoff, levels, and area of the water surface of Lake Barun-Torey from the natural ones are obtained. Calculations of the operating conditions of the designed reservoir show that it can only be filled at a probability of the flow rate of 50% or lower. Thus, it will remain unfilled for a long time, which casts some doubt on the economic expediency of its creation. Despite the low absolute discharge, its relative deviations from the natural conditions vary widely (from 3 to 192%). The effect of the reservoir on the deviation of the discharge and the levels and area of the lakes as compared to natural conditions is the most significant in dry periods. Thus, the creation of the reservoir may result in a significant change in the natural hydrological conditions of the Uldza River and the Torey Lakes and in negative consequences for the ecosystem.																			1875-3728	1875-371X				MAR	2023	44	1					48	55		10.1134/S1875372823010055	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1875372823010055													WOS:001031315700007
J	Slathia, N; Langer, S; Jasrotia, R				Slathia, Nidhi; Langer, Seema; Jasrotia, Raman			Assessment of water quality and its effect on prawn abundance in three tributaries of Shiwalik rivers: Chenab and Ravi of Jammu, India-a case study	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												The freshwater rivers from Shiwalik Himalayas have abundant prawn resources of high economic value and play a major role in the livelihood of local fishermen. The present study aimed to determine the variation in prawn abundance explained by changes in water quality among three different streams (Gho Manhasa stream, Chadwal stream and Nagri stream). The highest abundance of prawns was found in the Gho Manhasa during the premonsoon season and lowest in the Chadwal stream during the monsoon season. Chadwal stream witnessed maximum anthropogenic activities resulting in the decline of the water quality affecting prawn fauna. Cluster analysis based on similarity in terms of prawn abundance revealed that the Chadwal stream is different from the other two streams whereas non-metric multidimensional scaling plot based on species abundance corresponding to different seasons and physiochemical parameters showed the water quality of the monsoon season of the Chadwal stream to be extremely different. Principal component analysis showed clear separation across various sites and seasons based on physicochemical parameters. Karl Pearson correlation coefficient and canonical correspondence analysis indicated that the turbidity, total dissolved solids, nitrate, chloride, calcium, magnesium and dissolved oxygen are significant parameters influencing the abundance of prawns. The population of Macrobrachiumdayanum and Macrobrachiumkistnense was very less in the Chadwal stream owing to unfavorable physicochemical parameters. Therefore, conservation measures are suggested which should be immediately implemented before the streams witness a further decline in their populations.

J	Topçu, A; Atlig, S				Topcu, Akasya; Atlig, Seda			Post-Dredging Nitrogen Dynamics at the Sediment-Water Interface: The Shallow, Eutrophic Mogan Lake, Turkey	OCEANOLOGICAL AND HYDROBIOLOGICAL STUDIES												The sedimentation and resuspension of various forms of nitrogen in wetlands determines the direction of the nitrogen dynamics. Mogan Lake, in the Golbasi Special Environmental Protection Area, is one of the most important Ramsar-nominated wetlands in Turkey. Lake management applications have been performed by the local managers since 2008, including sediment cleaning activities such as dredging. In this context, the aim was to quantitatively predict the nitrogen dynamics (ammonium and nitrate release/uptake in the positive and/or negative direction) at the sediment-water interface, which has not been addressed in the eutrophication and sediment-related studies conducted to date on the lake in question. Sediment ammonium and nitrate flux were estimated to be between -9.16 and 0.36 mu g m(-2) d(-1) and between -67.2 and 35.16 mu g m(-2) d(-1), respectively. The estimations for sediment nitrogen flux in Mogan Lake did not show a regular seasonal or spatial fluctuation. Our results demonstrate that low nitrogen release levels in Mogan Lake do not pose a threat to its nutrient level. In conclusion, both monitoring and reducing external loading is still the top priority for a long-term recovery of water quality in the process of freshwater ecosystems.

Water-quality outcomes of wetland restoration depend on hydroperiod rather than restoration strategy	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Land managers increasingly use wetland restoration to improve water quality, particularly in cultivated landscapes. In agricultural wetland restoration, managers regularly excavate accumulated sediments eroded from the surrounding landscape to increase water storage capacity, decrease invasive species cover, or improve water quality. However, it is unclear whether the effects of sediment excavation are influenced by wetland hydroperiod. Additionally, we lack data on how long excavation effects persist in restored wetlands. We examined dissolved nutrient concentrations (i.e., NH4+, NO3-, total dissolved N, soluble reactive P, total dissolved P, and dissolved organic C) as proxies for water quality in 54 restored agricultural wetlands ranging from 1 to 10 y post-restoration in the Prairie Pothole Region of west central Minnesota, USA. In 26 of these wetlands, restoration practitioners restored natural (i.e., either seasonal or semipermanent inundation) hydrological regimes by removing subsurface tile drainage and plugging surface drainage ditches (business-as-usual treatment). In 28 wetlands, practitioners removed accumulated sediment and redeposited it on the surrounding landscape (excavated treatment) prior to restoring hydrology. We found that wetlands in the excavated treatment group initially experienced reduced dissolved P concentrations, but over time P levels increased, particularly in wetlands with shorter hydroperiods. Excavated wetlands had lower NH4+ and dissolved organic C concentrations compared with business-as-usual wetlands, but the trend was driven by differences between restoration treatments in semipermanent wetlands. N and P dynamics were almost universally related to hydroperiod, both immediately following restoration and over the ensuing years. We postulate that the effects of hydroperiod are likely related to differences in redox conditions via direct mechanisms (water level fluctuations related to hydroperiod) and indirect mechanisms (development of dense emergent macrophyte communities in seasonal wetlands). In basins with seasonal hydroperiod, inorganic N concentrations decreased over time and inorganic P concentrations increased, suggesting net P mobilization concurrent with growing N limitation. Our results illustrate that hydroperiod regulates the expression of legacy P following wetland restoration, with little long-term effect of sediment removal on water quality outcomes.

Burning to fish: local explanations for wetland burning in Lac Alaotra, Madagascar	ORYX												Lac Alaotra is Madagascar's largest take and a recognized wetland of international importance under the Ramsar Convention. It supports several Critically Endangered species, including the Alaotran gentle lemur Hapalemur alaotrensis. A principal threat facing the remaining Alaotran wetland is anthropogenic burning of the vegetation during the dry season; a practice now officially banned. A number of reasons have been given to explain this but to date no attempt has been made to investigate the principal motivations for the burning. We present the results of semi-structured interviews (n = 27) and questionnaires (n = 122) in a lakeside town. Seventy-eight percent of interviewees stated wetland burning was performed only or mainly to gather an introduced fish, the Asian snakehead Channa maculata, which buries into the underlying substrate during the dry season. Sixty-eight percent of questionnaire respondents provided a similar explanation. These data provide valuable insights into the reasons for the ongoing burning and should inform the management actions that are required to protect this globally important wetland.					; Jones, Julia P G/A-3031-2011; Jones, Julia/A-3031-2011; Andrianandrasana, Herizo/LHA-2169-2024	Andrianandrasana, Herizo/0000-0002-1538-4284; Jones, Julia P G/0000-0002-5199-3335; FA, Julia Elizabeth/0000-0002-1572-9828													0030-6053					JUL	2009	43	3					403	406		10.1017/S0030605309000520	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0030605309000520													WOS:000268970300021

Bacterial density varied from 0.3 x 10(8) to 1.4 x 10(8) cells cm(-2), and chlorophyll a concentration ranged from 0.7 to 25.9 mu g cm(-2), with no coupled oscillation between seasonal changes in these two parameters. In bottle incubation experiments, the instantaneous bacterial growth rate of bacteria was significantly correlated with their production rate [measured by frequency of dividing cells (FDC)] as follows: In mu = 0.138FDC - 3.003 (n = 15, r(2) = 0.445, p < 0.001). FDC values in the pebble biofilms increased with fluctuations during the study period, ranging from 3.6% to 9.2%. Bacterial production rates largely fluctuated between 0.15 to 0.92 mu g C cm(-2) h(-1), and its seasonal pattern was similar to that of bacterial density. Net primary production measured between May 2002 to November 2002 attained minimum level (0.5 mu g C cm(-2) h(-1)) in June and maximum level (1.9 mu g C cm(-2) h(-1)) in August. Percentages of bacterial production to net primary production ranged between 21% and 120%. Because this ratio extends both below and above 100% for these parameters, it is likely that both autochthonous and allochthonous supplies of organic matter are important for production of bacteria in the pebble biofilms that develop in rapidly flowing fresh water streams.

Resting eggs accumulate in the sediment and create a resting egg bank. Knowledge on the egg bank structure, morphology and morphometry of the eggs as well as the effect of cues on hatching, contributes to the understanding zooplankton dynamics in lakes. Here we described the composition and structure of zooplankton egg bank from a shallow tropical lake and analyzed the effect of some biotic factors on hatching rates. In order to describe the structure and composition of the resting egg bank, we determined the richness, density, morphology and morphometry of the resting eggs isolated by the sugar flotation method. Diapausing eggs were measured and their external features studied by microphotography under optical microscope and SEM. To analyze the effect of biotic factors on hatching rates, we exposed the resting structures and the entire sediment to three biotic factors: a chlorophyte (Scenedesmus acutus), a cyanobacteria (Microcystis sp.) and a predatory rotifer (Asplanchna girodi). A total of 25 zooplankton species hatched from the sediments. Our results show that the medium density of the healthy-looking diapausing eggs was of 7.6 +/- 2 diapausing eggs center dot cm(-3) and that rotifers are the predominant group in the egg bank. Medium conditioned with the chlorophyte and the cyanobacteria resulted in a higher hatching rate. The ornamentations of rotifer diapausing eggs present different features, such as wrinkles and spines, which can help to taxonomic identification without the need of promoting hatching. This study provides information on the structure and composition of the egg bank of a shallow lake and the effect of biotic factors on hatching rates. The results show the dominance of rotifers over cladocerans and copepods and a positive effect of certain biotic factors on hatching.					; Jiménez-Contreras, Jorge/B-8267-2019; Jimenez-Contreras, Jorge/B-8267-2019	Garcia-Zamorano, Jair/0000-0001-7596-4590; Jimenez-Contreras, Jorge/0000-0001-5497-970X														2823-1465				FEB 27	2023	59								3	10.1051/limn/2023002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/2023002													WOS:000940120100001

Four clone libraries were constructed from oxic epilimnion and anoxic hypolimnion samples collected during the dry season of 2002 in the northern and southern basins. Clone library analysis revealed a bacterial community composition (BCC) differing from previously studied freshwater systems and clear differences between both epi- and hypolimnion and the northern and southern basins. We detected few representatives of the Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, and Alpha- and Betaproteobacteria commonly found in freshwater environments in temperate and cold regions, but observed a remarkably high number of clones belonging to Chloroflexi and Gammaproteobacteria. This was especially the case in the hypolimmon, but also in the epilimnion in the south of the lake, which suggests that the BCC may be influenced by seasonal upwelling. In total, nearly half of the detected operational taxonomical units were not closely related to bacteria previously observed in freshwater environments. Even in the epilimnetic clone libraries, genotypes commonly reported from oxic freshwater environments (e.g. ACK4, LD12, Sta2-30) were rare or absent.

Production and loss rates of the protists were estimated using size fractionation (< 5 mum, < 30 mum and total) experiments. There were coupled oscillations in seasonal abundance between HNF and ciliates, whereas we found none between the protists and metazoan zooplankton. Seasonal trends in production of HNF (-12.4 to 86.4 ng C ml(-1) d(-1)) and predation rates on them by ciliates (-25.6 to 52.2 ng C ml-1 d-1) were similar. There were significant correlations (p < 0.05) between HNF production and predation on HNF by ciliates. These results indicate that ciliates are major consumers of HNF, but we have insufficient evidence of predation on HNF by metazoan predators to do more than suggest that food linkage between HNF and metazoan predators is not substantial. The dominant ciliate species were Cinetochilum margaritaceum, Urothcha spp., Halteria grandinella and Cyclidium glaucoma. Growth rates of Urotricha and Cyclidium populations were enhanced by removal of metazoan predators when the ciliates were dominant. We detected substantial predation pressure on Urotricha spp. during its period of dominance and found a significant correlation (p < 0.02) between production and predation of C. glaucoma. Thus, we suggest that there are active food linkages between these 2 ciliates and metazoan predators. For C. margaritaceum and H. grandinella, we did not have enough evidence to suggest predation by metazoan predators. Thus, we showed over a 1 yr period that HNF production was almost balanced by loss to predation by ciliates, and that loss processes other than predation might be important for some ciliate taxa.					; Nakano, Shin-ichi/M-5483-2016	Manage, Pathmalal/0000-0002-2014-2060; 													0948-3055	1616-1564				SEP 28	2001	25	3					259	270		10.3354/ame025259	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame025259													WOS:000171854800006

Therefore, this study intended to investigate the impacts of hydro-climatic factors and related water quality variables on zooplankton abundance and diversity in the perennial Vavuniya reservoir (VR) and seasonal Thandikulam reservoir (TR), Vavuniya, Sri Lanka. Results Zooplankton diversity and abundance showed some peculiarities between seasonal and perennial reservoirs under varying hydro-climatic factors and water quality parameters during wet and dry seasons (July 2018-February 2019). There were 14 Rotifera, 4 Cladocera and 5 Copepod species in VR, and in TR, 12 Rotifera, 2 Cladocera and 5 Copepod species were identified. Although these reservoirs are located at proximity (2.48 km), the responses via zooplankton community structure toward environmental factors have been shown uniqueness to some extent. Significant negative correlation was observed for increasing NO3- (p = 0.044) and PO43- (p = 0.010) concentrations with zooplankton diversity in perennial VR; however, only PO3- (4) concentration showed a significantly (p = 0.042) negative correlation in seasonal TR. Interestingly, total zooplankton abundance showed significant negative correlations with NO3- (p = 0.013) and PO43- (p = 0.038) in perennial VR; however, insignificant negative correlation was observed in seasonal TR. Copepods make up the majority of total zooplankton abundance in both reservoirs and were significantly affected by increased atmospheric temperature. Cladocera abundance in VR was highly sensitive (p = 0.032; r = - 0.856) to changes in water level. Increasing water level significantly favors the total zooplankton abundance in the seasonal reservoir but not in perennial. Conclusions Sensitivity of zooplankton community structure varies between seasonal and perennial reservoirs in different magnitudes. This is due to the increasing temperatures, increasing phosphate levels and decreasing water levels with the combination of other factors resulting in specific responses of zooplankton diversity and abundance. Therefore, it would not be surprised to use zooplankton community structure to sense the vibrant responses of different freshwater habitats.

J	Kurmayer, R				Kurmayer, R			Competitive ability of Daphnia under dominance of non-toxic filamentous cyanobacteria	HYDROBIOLOGIA												It is generally assumed that Daphnia is more susceptible to the inhibitory effects of filamentous cyanobacteria than small cladocerans since daphnids have a larger gape size and filtrate the filaments, whereas small cladocerans do not. This study addresses the question whether food limitation has the potential to modify this scenario of cladoceran response to dominance of non-toxic filamentous cyanobacteria. Daphnia galeata was grown under limited (0.1 mg C l(-1)) and unlimited concentrations (1.0 mg C l(-1)) of high-quality food algae both in the absence/presence of non-toxic filamentous Aphanizomenon flexuosum. As the effects of these cyanobacteria on D. galeata were positive under food limiting conditions and negative at the high food density, it was concluded that D. galeata was mainly affected by nutritional quality due to its ability to ingest the filaments, while mechanical interference with food collection was not important. In competition experiments between D. galeata and Bosmina longirostris, D. galeata was the dominant species at regular additions of food (1.0 mg C l(-1)) in the absence of Aphanizomenon. In the presence of these cyanobacteria, D. galeata was inhibited during the first days of the experimental period. However, the negative effect at the initially high food density was outweighed by nutrition at food limiting conditions and the outcome in competitive dominance was not changed. The results demonstrate that the ability of D. galeata to ingest large-sized non-toxic cyanobacteria can be considered as advantageous under food limiting conditions.					; Kurmayer, Rainer/AFJ-4791-2022	Kurmayer, Rainer/0000-0002-2100-9616; 													0018-8158					JAN	2001	442	1-3					279	289		10.1023/A:1017598518952	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017598518952													WOS:000167924900027
J	Johnson, PD; McMahon, RF				Johnson, PD; McMahon, RF			Effects of temperature and chronic hypoxia on survivorship of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) and Asian clam (Corbicula fluminea)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												We examined the effects of four levels of chronic hypoxic stress at three temperatures on the survivorship of Dreissena polymorpha and Corbicula fluminea to assess the efficacy of O-2 deprivation as a macrofouling control treatment and examine if critical hypoxia limits support reported distribution patterns. Al 25 degrees C, the hypoxia tolerance was examined at Po-2 = 7.9, 11.9, 15.9, 23.8, and 31.8 Torr(1 Torr = 133.322 Pa) or 5, 7.5, 10, 15, and 20% of full air O-2 saturation (Po-2 = 159 Torr). At 15 degrees C, the hypoxia tolerance to 7.9, 11.9, and 15.9 Torr was tested and at 7.9 Torr for 5 degrees C treatments. For both species, Po, and temperature influenced survivorship dramatically with increasing survivorship at higher Po-2 and decreasing temperatures. At 25 degrees C, C. fluminea experienced mortality at 7.9, 11.9, and 15.9 Torr, with LT50 values of 144, 216, and 214 h, respectively, versus 288, 384, and 480 h for the 15 degrees C exposures. Dreissena polymorpha treatments had LT50 values of 120, 216, and 216 h at 25 degrees C for the 7.9-, 11.9-, and 15.9-Torr treatments versus 26% mortality after 600 h and 28% mortality after 720 h at 15 degrees C. The 7.9-Torr treatments at 5 degrees C had LT50 values of 480 h for C. fluminea and 1056 h for D. polymorpha. This study showed that both species displayed broad seasonal Variation in hypoxia tolerance and that hypoxia limits may be used to assess infestation risk.																			0706-652X					JUL	1998	55	7					1564	1572		10.1139/cjfas-55-7-1564	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-55-7-1564													WOS:000076176300002

These tailings originate from the Silver Valley mining district drained by the South Fork of the Coeur d'Alene River. The possibilities that either lake eutrophication or the development of a seasonally anoxic hypolimnion could mobilize trace elements from sediments into overlying waters led us to evaluate their phase associations. Analysis of similar to 0.5 m gravity cores reveals these sediments to be highly reduced, and the trace elements therein predominantly associated with an operationally defined sulfidic phase. Vertical patterns of metal distribution suggest that Fe, Mn, and As have mobilized toward the sediment-water interface; these patterns are consistent with diagenetic solubilization. This is not the case for Zn, Pb, and other trace elements whose maximum abundance is generally found in deeper sediments. We postulate that metal sulfide formation and metal binding with organic material restricts mobilization of most trace elements. The abundance of redox-active elements such as As, Fe, and Mn is highly correlated by depth. The abundance of less redox-sensitive elements such as Pb and Zn is also highly correlated; however, the two groups correlate poorly with one other.

The precipitation-normalized Be-7 flux increases with increasing amount of precipitation. There is no systematic and consistent seasonal trend in the depositional fluxes for Be-7 or for Pb-210. The volume-weighted Pb-210 concentrations, when normalized to the amount of precipitation, seem to be constant over the time period of this, study. Four to six heavy rain events (> 5 cm) in a single day account for 20-30% of the annual deposition of Be-7 and Pb-210. Such events account, however, for only about 4-6% of the total number of rainy days in a year. The dry depositional fluxes of these nuclides appear to be a significant fraction of the bulk depositional flux only during the months when there is very little rain. The fraction of dry to total depositional flux of Pb-210 appears to be higher than that of Be-7. The strong positive correlation between Be-7 and Pb-210 depositional fluxes indicates that the flux of both nuclides is controlled by scavenging processes by local precipitation. This correlation also indicates that a major portion of the air masses that brings precipitation to Galveston and College Station is of continental origin. Our data therefore suggest that Be-7 and Pb-210 cannot be used as independent atmospheric tracers in our coastal station. This observation is consistent with those observed at many other continental and coastal stations.

L.; Lawson, Zachary; Gerbyshak, Joseph; Nye, Nathan; Donofrio, Michael			Catch-and-Release Angling Effects on Lake Sturgeon in Wisconsin, USA	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Discard mortality is an important factor to consider when managing catch-and-release fisheries. Even low levels of discard mortality can induce population-level effects particularly in long-lived, low-productivity species like Lake Sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens. Unfortunately, little is known about the effects of catch-and-release angling on Lake Sturgeon physiology and probability of discard mortality. We used controlled angling events with standardized gear to capture 96 Lake Sturgeon from August to October 2019 from four regional locations in Wisconsin, USA. We evaluated the physiological effects of angling and activation of the stress response using whole blood concentrations of lactate and glucose as well as assessment of reflex impairment and postcapture monitoring of recovery time. Lactate levels were positively related to fight duration and the fight duration x total length interaction. Glucose level was related to the time a fish spent out of water postangling event. Water temperature had a positive effect on the probability of reflex impairment and the probability that a sturgeon required recovery time. The recovery duration was positively related to the amount of time that the fish was out of water. The movements of a subset of 15 individuals from one location were monitored using acoustic telemetry for approximately 2 weeks postangling. All individuals showed continuous up- and downstream movement during the postrelease monitoring period, and there was no evidence of mortality related to the angling events. Managers considering catch-and-release fisheries for Lake Sturgeon should consider population-specific relative abundance and catch rates. They should exercise caution in scenarios when seasonal aggregations may lead populations to be susceptible to high catch rates, during times of elevated water temperatures, or the combination of these factors. The Lake Sturgeon in this study appeared to be robust to angling-induced stress effects. Nevertheless, caution is still warranted, as low levels of discard mortality have the potential to influence low-productivity species like Lake Sturgeon.

Under these conditions, specific patterns of phyto- and zooplankton structure and quantitative characteristics, that, as was found out earlier, result from the vital activity of birds belonging to the family Ardeidae (namely, raising the share of mixotrophic phytoflagellates and copepods in plankton species composition) are leveled out. The main role in this process belongs to decomposition of immersed vegetation in the coastal zone, development of littoral macrophytes, and trophic relationships between algae and invertebrates. However, increase in atmospheric precipitation leads to increase in copepods abundance, which seems to be related to fast and intensive inflow of nitrogen-rich products of birds' vital activity. Due to this, during the whole period of observations, the following tendencies are revealed in biochemical composition of seston, plankton, and fish fry in the vicinity of the bird colony: 1) concentrations of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus and their ratios turn out to be auspicious for predominance of diatoms and mixotrophic phytoflagellates, rich in docosahexaenoic acid (DSA); 2) the abundance of phytoplankton, rich in polyunsaturated essential fatty acids (PEFA), favors propagation of those planktonic crustaceans which contain significantly more DSA and are more valuable food items for fish; 3) predominance of zooplankters, rich in PEFA, leads to higher concentration of PEFA in fry fish tissues, which, in certain periods, turns out to be advantageous for successful development and growth of dominant species of fish fry,such as roach, bream, white bream, and perch, by comparison with the test site.

Antimony species including antimonite Sb(III), antimonate Sb(V) and the fraction of organic forms (Sb-org) in overlying water at different temperatures were regularly measured during the simulation period. Different bound antimony forms in sediments were also determined along with the different antimony species in porewaters after the simulation terminated. The results indicated that temperature change during seasonal alternation plays an important role in the migration and transformation behavior of antimony at the sediment-water interface of the Poyang Lake. Antimony species both in porewaters and overlying water were sensitive to the variation of temperature, especially the Sb-org species. Antimony migrates from porewaters to the overlying water when the temperature decreases, and meanwhile the equilibrium between Sb(III) and Sb(V) in porewaters shifts toward Sb(V) when the temperature increases during seasonal alternation. Although temperature had less influence on the antimony species in sediments than in porewaters or in the overlying water, the average content of each antimony species in sediments increased with the decrease of temperature, suggesting that the decrease of temperature causes enrichment of antimony in the sediment.

We present a seasonal study focusing on bacterivory by heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) and ciliates in the silty sediment of a temperate macrophyte-dominated oxbow lake. From January 2001 to February 2002 we monitored the standing stock of bacteria and protozoa, bacterial secondary production (BSP, H-3-thymidine, and C-14-leucine incorporation), and grazing rates of HNF and ciliates on bacteria (FLB uptake) in the oxic sediment of the investigated system. BSP ranged from 470 to 4050 mug C L-1 wet sediment h(-1). The bacterial compartment turned out to be highly dynamic, indicated by population doubling times (0.6-10.0 d), which were comparable to those in the water column of the investigated system. Yet, the control mechanisms acting upon the bacterial population led to a relative constancy of bacterial standing stock during a year. Ingestion rates of protozoan grazers were 0-20.0 bacteria HNF-1 h(-1) and 097.6 bacteria ciliate(-1) h(-1). HNF and ciliates together cropped 0-14 (mean 4)% of BSP, indicating that they did not significantly contribute to benthic bacterial mortality during any period of the year. The low impact of protozoan grazing was due to the low numbers of HNF and ciliates in relation to bacteria (1.8-3.5 x 10(4) bacteria HNF-1, 0.9-3.1 x 10(6) bacteria ciliate(-1)). Thus, grazing by HNF and ciliates could be ruled out as a parameter regulating bacterial standing stock or production in the sediment of the investigated system, but the factors responsible for the limitation of benthic protistan densities and the fate of benthic BSP remained unclear.

Inferred climates at 3000-yr intervals from 18 000 years ago to the present, based on six taxa (spruce, birch, northern pines, oak, southern pines, and prairie forbs), were used to generate time series of simulated isopoll maps for these taxa and seven others (hickory, fir, beech, hemlock, elm, alder, and sedge). The simulations captured the essential features of the observed isopoll maps for both sets of taxa, including differences in migration patterns during the past 10000 yr that have previously been attributed to differential migration lag. These results establish that the continental-scale vegetation patterns have responded to continuous changes in climate from the last glacial maximum to the present, with lags less-than-or-equal-to 1500 yr. The inferred climatic changes include seasonality changes consistent with orbitally controlled changes in insolation, and shifts in temperature and moisture gradients that are consistent with modelled climatic interactions of the insolation changes with the shrinking Laurentide ice sheet. These results pose new ecological questions about the processes by which vegetated landscapes approach dynamic equilibrium with their changing environment.

Freshwater lakes are still facing a series of problems, e.g. a decline in water quality, and a decrease in biodiversity. Thus, assessing the state of aquatic ecological health of the lake has drawn widespread attention from scholars both at home and abroad. Aims. This study aims to assess the state of aquatic ecological health of Poyang Lake and analyse the influencing factors. Methods. The long-term (2007-2018) site-monitoring data were analysed on the basis of the extension-evaluation method and correlation-analysis method. Key results. The results showed that the aquatic ecological health was mainly "good', and remarkable seasonal differences were observed. The seasonal order of relative aquatic ecological health could be expressed as the wet season being better than the dry season, whereas the rising season was similar to the retreating season. And the pollutant discharged into the lake was found to be the key factor, and the hydrological conditions led to seasonal differences in the state of aquatic ecological health of Poyang Lake. Conclusions. Consequently, scholars and policymakers should focus on both nutrient concentrations and hydrological conditions, which are the key factors influencing the aquatic ecological health of Poyang Lake. Implications. The results of this study have provided a theoretical and practical basis of the causes of ecological deterioration and should help with ecological-health protection of the large lakes connected with the Yangtze River.					; Zhang, Yanhui/L-5680-2017	Li, Bing/0000-0003-4090-7160; 													1323-1650	1448-6059					2023	74	9-10			SI		807	816		10.1071/MF22154	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF22154		FEB 2023											WOS:000933714300001

Sedimentary archives of lakes in mountainous regions may also record non-climatic events such as earthquakes. We argue herein that a set of 64 annual laminae couplets reconciles a stratigraphically inconsistent accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) C-14 chronology in a similar to 4-m-long sediment core from Lake Mengda, in the north-eastern Tibetan Plateau. The laminations suggest the lake was formed by a large landslide, triggered by the 1927 Gulang earthquake (M = 8.0). The lake sediment sequence can be separated into three units based on lithologic, sedimentary, and isotopic characteristics. Starting from the bottom of the sequence, these are: (1) unweathered, coarse, sandy valley-floor deposits or landslide debris that pre-date the lake, (2) landslide-induced, fine-grained soil or reworked landslide debris with a high organic content, and (3) lacustrine sediments with low organic content and laminations. These annual laminations provide a high-resolution record of anthropogenic and environmental changes during the twentieth century, recording enhanced sediment input associated with two phases of construction activities. The high mean sedimentation rates of up to 4.8 mm year(-1) underscore the potential for reconstructing such distinct sediment pulses in remote, forested, and seemingly undisturbed mountain catchments.

In a whole-lake experiment covering 5 years, we added the intermediate consumer roach (Rutilus rutilus) to two out of four lakes previously inhabited by the omnivorous top predator perch (Perca fluviatilis). We focused our study on the direct consumption effect of roach presence on zooplankton (and indirectly phytoplankton) versus the indirect effect of roach on zooplankton (and phytoplankton) mediated via effects on perch reproductive performance. The patterns in zooplankton and phytoplankton abundances were examined in relation to population density of roach and perch including young-of-the-year (YOY) perch in the light of non-equilibrium dynamics. The presence of roach resulted in changed seasonal dynamics of zooplankton with generally lower biomasses in May-June and higher biomasses in July-August in roach lakes compared to control lakes. Roach presence affected perch recruitment negatively and densities of YOY perch were on average higher in control lakes than in treatment lakes. In years when perch recruitment did not differ between lakes as a result of experimental addition of perch eggs, total zooplankton biomass was lower in treatment lakes than in control lakes. Phytoplankton biomass showed a tendency to increase in roach lakes compared to control lakes. Within treatment variation in response variables was related to differences in lake morphometry in treatment lakes. Analyses of the trophic dynamics of each lake separately showed strong cascading effects of both roach and YOY perch abundance on zooplankton and phytoplankton dynamics. Consideration of the long transients in the dynamics of top predators (fish) in aquatic systems that are related to their long life span involving ontogenetic niche shifts is essential for making relevant interpretations of experimental perturbations. This conclusion is further reinforced by the circumstance that the intrinsic dynamics of fish populations may in many cases involve high amplitude dynamics with long time lags.

Larvae and juveniles are both diurnal feeders, and they both feed essentially on copepods, which are the most abundant prey in littoral areas, but they show a marked preference for larger organisms (cladocerans), when available. This indicates a rather intense resource sharing, and probable competition between life stages, which is partly solved through spatial behaviour and segregation. During the dry season, when food resources are scarcer. larvae and juveniles make slightly offset inshore migrations during the day, so that they feed at different places, on copepods of different sizes. Because diel migrations are size-structured, it is suggested that cannibalistic pressure (by adults over juveniles, and by juveniles over larvae) may also be a driving factor for these migrations. Plankton samples revealed that there were few cladocerans, while copepods were abundant and their size was similar to that prior to the introduction of L, miodon in Lake Kivu, thereby suggesting that some form of dynamic equilibrium has been reached in the food web.					; Baras, Etienne/K-1894-2016	Descy, Jean-Pierre/0000-0003-1649-7800; Baras, Etienne/0000-0002-3541-6597; 													0266-4674	1469-7831				JAN	2004	20		1				73	83		10.1017/S0266467403001056	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0266467403001056													WOS:000188953600007

Primary production was highest in the subsurface layer, possibly due to near-surface photoinhibition of photosynthesis, even under 0.8m of ice cover in March. Areal primary production varied from 79 Mg Cm-2 day(-1) (March) to 424 mg Cm-2 day(-1) (August), and annual primary production was roughly estimated as 75g Cm-2 year(-1), both of which are within the lower range of previous estimates. Size fractionation measurements revealed that phytoplankton in the <20 mum fraction accounted for 72%, 96%, and 85% of total primary production in March, August, and October, respectively. The contribution of picophytoplankton (<2mum) to total primary production ranged from 41% to 62%. A large fraction (82%-98%) of particulate organic carbon was associated with particles in the <20mum fraction. These results suggest that nano- and picophytoplankton play an important role as primary producers in the pelagic ecosystem of Lake Baikal.

J	Brorstrom-Lunden, E; Lofgren, C				Brorstrom-Lunden, E; Lofgren, C			Atmospheric fluxes of persistent semivolatile organic pollutants to a forest ecological system at the Swedish west coast and accumulation in spruce needles	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Measurements of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have been carried out in a forested area at Lake Gardsjon. The overall aim of this study was to identify the importance of atmospheric fluxes for the occurrence of persistent semivolatile organic compounds in a forest at the Swedish west coast and to measure the major pathways of circulation and accumulation of these contaminants within a terrestrial ecosystem. The sampling was undertaken in campaigns chosen to represent different seasons. The measurements carried out in 1991-94 were concentrated on the uptake of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in spruce needles in relation to concentrations in air and amounts in deposition, while the measurements undertaken in 1995 also included sampling of throughfall, litterfall and run-off. The concentrations of PCBs and PAHs in the different compartments have been used to identify important reservoirs and to estimate the annual fluxes of these compounds. The results of measurements showed that atmospheric fluxes are important for the occurrence of PCBs and PAHs in forest at the Swedish west coast. A seasonal variation was found in the atmospheric concentrations, and the ambient temperature was important for PCBs in air. The amounts of PAHs and PCBs deposited to the Gardsjo area (open field) were similar to those obtained during measurements at coastal- and sea-based sites at the Swedish west coast. Soot episodes at the Swedish west coast affected the deposition fluxes of POPs in the forest. There seemed to be both an accumulation and release of POPs in different compartments in this forest ecosystem. A greater deposition of POPs was found in the forest soil via throughfall compared with the open field deposition. An estimate of the fluxes of PAHs and PCBs in the catchment area in a forest showed that the soil is the main reservoir for POPs in this area. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Individual level microbial communities in the digestive system of the freshwater isopod Asellus aquaticus: Complex, robust and prospective	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY REPORTS												The freshwater isopod Asellus aquaticus is an important decomposer of leaf detritus, and its diverse gut microbiome has been depicted as key contributors in lignocellulose degradation as of terrestrial isopods. However, it is not clear whether the individual-level microbiome profiles in the isopod digestive system across different habitats match the implied robust digestion function of the microbiome. Here, we described the bacterial diversity and abundance in the digestive system (hindgut and caeca) of multiple A. aquaticus individuals from two contrasting freshwater habitats. Individuals from a lake and a stream harboured distinct microbiomes, indicating a strong link between the host-associated microbiome and microbes inhabiting the environments. While faeces likely reflected the variations in environmental microbial communities included in the diet, the microbial communities also substantially differed in the hindgut and caeca. Microbes closely related to lignocellulose degradation are found consistently more enriched in the hindgut in each individual. Caeca often associated with taxa implicated in endosymbiotic/parasitic roles (Mycoplasmatales and Rickettsiales), highlighting a complex host-parasite-microbiome interaction. The results highlight the lability of the A. aquaticus microbiome supporting the different functions of the two digestive organs, which may confer particular advantages in freshwater environments characterized by seasonally fluctuating and spatially disparate resource availability.																			1758-2229					JUN	2023	15	3					188	196		10.1111/1758-2229.13142	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1758-2229.13142		FEB 2023						36779263					WOS:000932605300001

Pelagic food web interactions in a large invaded ecosystem: Implications for reintroducing a native top predator	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												A series of species introductions, overexploitation, and habitat modification preceded the extirpation of Lahontan cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii henshawi; LCT), historically the apex predator, from Lake Tahoe, California-Nevada, USA. Studies evaluating limiting factors for LCT emphasise the need to elucidate food web interactions, yet important knowledge gaps regarding trophic interactions among nonnative pelagic fishes and invertebrates remain. We quantified the abundance and consumption demand of planktivores with an emphasis on kokanee (Oncorhynchus nerka) and Mysis diluviana. We synthesised this new information with existing information for lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush). The seasonal supply of copepods satisfied the consumption demand of kokanee, but only supported low feeding and growth rates. Kokanee relied heavily on Mysis as prey, an unusual result. Mysis exhibited a high degree of herbivory initially followed by heavier consumption on copepods by larger individuals. Consumption demand for Mysis on copepods exceeded that of kokanee during all seasons. Mysis contributed to over 50% of the annual energy budget for lake trout up to 625 mm. Consumption of Mysis by lake trout and kokanee represented a significant source of mortality when compared to the production of Mysis. Predation on kokanee was sustainable, only involved lake trout >625 mm, and was focused on prespawning aggregations. Despite the presence of Mysis-fueled lake trout, kokanee have persisted; a noteworthy pattern when considering the negative responses of kokanee to nonnative lake trout and Mysis observed elsewhere. This pattern suggests that there may still be an effective niche for LCT in the invaded Lake Tahoe ecosystem.

Evolution of sexual segregation in mammalian herbivores: kangaroos as marsupial models	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY					Symposium on Marsupials as Models for Research held at the 9th International Mammalogical Congress	AUG, 2005	Sapporo, JAPAN	Australian Mammal Soc				Sexual segregation is best known in sexually dimorphic ungulates. Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain the evolution of sexual segregation in ungulates, but all are reducible to the influence of two factors: body size and sex-specific reproductive strategy. Definitive tests of these hypotheses are lacking in ungulates because these factors are confounded, all males being somewhat larger than females. Kangaroos represent a parallel radiation of terrestrial herbivores, but their populations are composed of a spectrum of adult body sizes, ranging from small males the same size as females to large males more than twice the size. We exploited this heteromorphism to assess the independent influences of size and sex in these ungulate analogues. We conducted a preliminary study of western grey kangaroos ( Macropus fuliginosus) in north-western Victoria, Australia. Adult males predominately occupied grassland habitat, whereas females occurred mostly in lakebed, woodland and shrubland. Single-sex groups occurred more often than expected during the non-mating season. The diet of large males had the highest proportion of grass, and females had the least. These initial results indicate that both size and sex influence segregation in this species, confirming the worth of kangaroos as marsupial models for research into the evolution of sexual segregation.

Suspected sources of contamination include human sewage, agricultural runoff, and feces front wildlife and domestic animals, depending on beach location. Waterfowl have been suggested as a primary source of fecal contamination at many beaches, but techniques to '' prove '' contaminating microbes are of avian origin are mostly unsubstantiated. Researchers often rely on bird counts to measure the impact of waterfowl on beach health. Since waterfowl populations at Door County, Wisconsin (USA) beaches are transitory, this study focused on enumeration of avian waste material along beach transects, rather than on once per day '' snapshot '' bird counts. Escherichia coli (E. coli) concentration in beach water was not correlated with avian waste counts at the ten beaches studied in 2004 or the 13 studied in 2005 (rural to semi-to-urban). Bird counts correlated with E. coli concentrations in beach water at 30% of the sample sites in 2004 and at only one site in 2005. During the 2004 swimming season avian waste counts correlated with bird counts at only one beach and there was no correlation in 2005. These results indicate that neither avian waste enumeration nor bird counts call successfully be used to predict microbial contamination of recreational water at selected Great Lakes beaches.																			0380-1330						2006	32	1					117	123		10.3394/0380-1330(2006)32[117:EOAWAB]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3394/0380-1330(2006)32[117:EOAWAB]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000236636000010

The 1971-2014 glass eel catch from an estuary, Lake Hamana, Japan, was compared with the mean water temperature difference (WTD) between two coastal sites, Shirahama and Lake Hamana, during the glass eel fishing season. The directions of interannual change (i.e., increase/decrease) in the glass eel catch and WTD fully synchronized for 12 consecutive years (1995-2006), and these variables were positively correlated (r = 0.68, p = 0.0150). The WTD was correlated with the southernmost latitude of the Kuroshio path (r = 0.40, p = 0.0068) in the fishing season of the study period (1971-2014); therefore, the WTD appeared to reflect the path fluctuations of the Kuroshio and the warm water intrusions from this western boundary current. The proportion of matching directions between the interannual changes in the glass eel catch and WTD was 0.71 for the non-meander (nearshore) path years (significantly higher than 0.5, the expected proportion of matching signs due to chance; x(2) = 2.88, p = 0.0448), whereas it was 0.46 for the meander (offshore) path years ( x(2) = 0.15, p = 0.6526). Thus, the WTD tends to interannually increase/decrease with the estuarine recruitment of A. japonica glass eels when the Kuroshio flows with non-meander paths. This environment-recruitment relationship (western boundary current-recruitment link) in the Japanese eel demonstrates the importance of continuous environmental monitoring of coastal waters.

Morphotypes differed significantly in distribution and in seed characteristics. A 'large'-seeded morphotype (endocarp mass = 3.83 mg) was associated with treefall gaps in the forest interior, whereas a 'small'-seeded morphotype (endocarp mass = 1.38 mg) was found predominantly on landslides on the margins of Lake Gatun. Seeds of the small-seeded morphotype germinated faster than seeds of the large-seeded morphotype, with seedlings of the small-seeded morphotype showing both a higher Unit Leaf Rate (ULR) and a lower Specific Leaf Area (SLA). Differences in photosynthetic rates reflected differences in SLA; the small-seeded morphotype had a higher rate on a leaf area basis, while the large-seeded morphotype had a higher rate on a leaf mass basis. Although allocation patterns between morphotypes varied in a way consistent with known interspecific differences between 'sun' and 'shade' plants, relative growth rates (RGR) of the morphotypes were similar across different light conditions suggesting that factors other than light, such as water uptake efficiency, soil nutrient requirements, and perhaps seed dispersal characters may explain the habitat partitioning of morphotypes.

HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												On a historical time scale, this paper investigates the effect of hydroclimatic variations on the surface water salinity of Lake Tanganyika, the largest African lake and an open freshwater reservoir. Through annual water and chemical budgets, based on original and bibliographic data, a tracer of the water regime is proposed. Chloride, an inert and conservative element, seems to be the best candidate although its contribution to salinity is small; its use as a tracer of the water regime is validated on seasonal and historical time scales. Seasonally, a monthly water and chloride budget, constructed for an average year has been compared with data acquired in 1973. On a historical time scale, bibliographic data of surface chloride concentrations, compiled since 1939 have been compared with the level variation curve. The relation between lake level and surface water chloride concentration is significant on both time scales. Hence, the surface salinity/chlorinity of this freshwater lake is sensitive to hydroclimatic variations even if level variations are very limited in comparison with its great depth. This sensitivity is due mainly to the permanent thermo-haline stratification of the lake.

The spatial distribution of meiofauna among sampling stations changed with nutrient levels. Nematoda were most abundant at the majority of sampling stations comprising 70.6 - 93.2 % meiofaunal abundance except for a hypereutrophic station. The seasonal patterns in abundance of nematodes, oligochaetes, rotifers, chironomids and different nematode feeding groups differed among stations, which revealed that the temporal variations of these meiofaunal groups and the nematode feeding groups may vary with different nutrient loadings. The vertical distributions of meiofaunal groups, nematode species, and nematode trophic groups in the upper and lower sediment layers were similar, suggesting a consistent vertical distribution pattern across different trophic conditions. Nematode species richness, Shannon-Wiener species diversity index, trophic diversity and Maturity Index were significantly correlated with nutrient levels (total phosphorus and nitrogen in lake water and total phosphorus in sediment). Our results suggest the importance of nematode community analyses in the assessment of freshwater eutrophication.																			0003-9136					APR	2004	159	4					555	575		10.1127/0003-9136/2004/0159-0555	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/0003-9136/2004/0159-0555													WOS:000221128300007

It plays a crucial role in runoff regulation. Investigations on the mechanisms of water and heat exchanges are necessary to understand the land surface processes over the alpine wetland. This study explores the characteristics of hydro-meteorological factors with in situ observations and uses the Community Land Model 5 to identify the main factors controlling water and heat exchanges. Latent heat flux and thermal roughness length were found to be greater in the warm season (June-August) than in the cold season (December-February), with a frozen depth of 20-40 cm over the alpine wetland. The transfers of heat fluxes were mainly controlled by longwave radiation and air temperature and affected by root distribution. Air pressure and stomatal conductance were also important to latent heat flux, and soil solid water content was important to sensible heat flux. Soil temperature was dominated by longwave radiation and air temperature, with crucial surface parameters of initial soil liquid water content and total water content. The atmospheric control factors transitioned to precipitation and air temperature for soil moisture, especially at the shallow layer (5 cm). Meanwhile, the more influential surface parameters were root distribution and stomatal conductance in the warm season and initial soil liquid water content and total water content in the cold season.

The objective of this study was to investigate the concentration and spatial distribution of trace metals in surface sediments in the Rosario reservoir, which is affected by the intensive aquaculture of Tilapia-do-Nilo (Oreochromis niloticus). Sediment samples were collected in three different areas, postculture (PCTV), cultivation (CTV) and control (CTRL) in the dry season in 2019. The granulometric composition, organic matter and concentrations of Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Cr, Cd, Pb and Ni metals were determined. Multivariate statistics were used. Geochemical and ecotoxicological indices and a comparison with sediment quality guidelines (SQG) were used. The sediment was characterized by silty clay loam with an average organic matter of 18.76 +/- 4.27. The analytical merit figures demonstrated accuracy (metal recoveries in certified standards) between 89 to 99% and high precision (RSD < 5%). The concentration ranges for the metals were Fe: 0.11-0.85 (%), Mn: 14.46-86.91, Zn: 2.6-220.56, Cu: 26.89-98.75, Cr: 60.18-76.06, Cd: 0.38-0.59, Pb: 18.13-43.13, and Ni: 34.4-46.75, all in (mg/kg(-1)). The highest concentration values were found in the CTV areas (Fe: 40 +/- 0.22, Mn: 66.48 +/- 19.11, Zn: 114.83 +/- 59.75 and Cr: 70.85 +/- 2.62) and PCTV (Cd: 0.53 +/- 0.04, Cu: 71.83 +/- 21.20, Pb: 33.71 +/- 4.34 and Ni: 44.60 +/- 1.79). Pearson's correlation, hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis confirmed the influence of fish farming on metals. Only Ni presented concentration values higher than the reference value established in the SQG. Thus, considering the probable geochemical and ecotoxicological effects, they comprise the two lowest levels of impact.					; Oliveira-Tintino, Cícera/G-7687-2016; Tintino, Saulo Relison/B-3049-2014; Menezes, Jorge/Y-2694-2019; Tintino, Saulo/B-3049-2014; Coutinho, Henrique/E-1046-2013; Teixeira, Raimundo/AAD-9603-2021; de paula filho, francisco jose/L-8133-2013; de Paula Filho, Francisco/L-8133-2013; Araújo, José Anízio/U-9347-2018	do Nascimento Melo Junior, Henio/0000-0001-6824-6275; Tintino, Saulo Relison/0000-0002-7733-9331; Coutinho, Henrique/0000-0002-6634-4207; de paula filho, francisco jose/0000-0002-6253-461X; 														2075-1729				FEB	2023	13	2							338	10.3390/life13020338	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/life13020338								36836697					WOS:000940625200001

Over 50% of the rice field area has been ruined by the intrusions. Recently, practices of the farmers to adapt to and cope with the saltwater intrusions into rice fields were assessed to be medium level effective. However, there were two adaptations rated at high levels. Those were "monitoring news on saltwater intrusions" and "supplementary careers instead of doing only rice farming". The farmers' guidelines to cope with the saltwater intrusions into rice fields were:1) alternating rice farming system, 2) adjusting the government support policies, 3) changing rice varieties, 4) growing other crops in the rice fields after rice farming season, 5) raising animals along with rice farming, 6) creating supple-mentary incomes, and 7) grouping farmers. The guidelines that most farmers agreed to practice were: 1) growing rice varieties that met household consumption, 2) growing high-value rice varieties, and 3) growing some saltwater tolerant plants after the rice-farming season. Coping with the problem of saltwater intrusions was rated at a high level. The study found that growing rice varieties that met household consumption along with the promoted rice varieties was preferred by the farmers. The second highest ranked was growing rice according to policies for the management of rice economic zone and mixed farms. These are guidelines that could be managed at the household level to maintain independent farming in the affected areas.																			1310-0351					FEB	2023	29	1					70	79																WOS:000994388900005
J	Rhude, KS; Sterner, RW				Rhude, Kirsten S.; Sterner, Robert W.			Diporeia site preference in Lake Superior: Food or physical factors?	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Vital to the Lake Superior food web, the amphipod Diporeia remains the dominant macroinvertebrate in Lake Superior despite drastic population declines throughout the rest of the Laurentian Great Lakes. Diporeia is most abundant in the slope region of the lake at water depths between 30 and 125 m. It has been hypothesized that this depth range is preferred because of elevated primary production and deposition within this zone. This hypothesis of food driving habitat preference has not been directly tested. Here we used 120-hour preference-avoidance trials to record Diporeia choice of sediments from different water depths, seasons, and other treatments. Most preferences were weak to absent; however, Diporeia strongly preferred sediment from 30-and 60-m water depths over deeper or shallower sites. Contrary to the hypothesis about food driving habitat choice, chemical characteristics did not explain this strong preference. Grain size variation was the only measured variable that was consistent between the sites preferred by Diporeia and different from unpreferred sites. Both the 30-and 60-meter sites con-tained predominantly medium silt but had a wider range in grain sizes. These results indicate that phys-ical habitat characteristics may have a stronger bearing on Diporeia habitat preference than food availability and may account for their distribution in the lake. The results also may imply that the role of dreissenid mussels as ecosystem engineers altering sediment physical characteristics may be impor-tant where they are abundant.(c) 2023 The Authors.

J	Wang, D; Zhou, T				Wang, Dong; Zhou, Tao			Analysis and Prediction of Poyang Lake's Navigable Conditions under a New Hydrological Regime	WATER												Human activities have profoundly changed the hydrological regime and trends of rivers and lakes, which, in turn, has affected the utilization of their navigable conditions. However, few studies have focused on the effects of changes in hydrological regimes and trends of rivers and lakes on navigable conditions. Thus, this study intensively analyzes and investigates the navigable depth at the major control sections in the lake area during the dry season in the period before 2002, when the Three Gorges Reservoir was not yet constructed, and the period from 2003 to 2019, when the Three Gorges Project was put into operation with impoundment based on the dry-season water level curve in the Poyang Lake area since the operation of the Three Gorges Reservoir. This study also further analyzes the influence of the change in the hydrological regime on the navigable depth in the lake area. The results show that the waterway depth and width could meet the navigation requirements before 2002. From 2003 to 2019, whereas the water level with a 98% guarantee rate of duration at the Xingzi Hydrometric Station decreased, that at the Hukou Hydrometric Station increased. The waterway depth and width at both the Hukou and Xingzi hydrometric stations could meet the requirements of the size of Grade II waterways. This study also performs a simulation prediction of the water regime of Poyang Lake under a new hydrological regime using the mathematical model of water and sediment of the Changjiang River Scientific Research Institute. The results reveal that in 2030 and 2050, after the Three Gorges Reservoir has been in operation for 30-50 years, the water levels at the Hukou, Xingzi, and Wucheng hydrometric stations (Hukou) of Poyang Lake will decline by approximately 0.18-0.66 and 0.10-0.24 m, respectively. Although the overall navigable depth can basically meet the navigation requirements for a period of time, the trend of the long-term declining water level may cause unsafe navigation risks.																				2073-4441				FEB	2023	15	3							583	10.3390/w15030583	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15030583													WOS:000931344500001

Its chemical nature and sources in marine environments and lakes have been extensively studied. However, DOM properties from river-reservoir systems in high altitude and severe cold climate regions remain unclear. In this study, the DOM components and sources in the upper "river-reservoir" system of the Yellow River were investigated using parallel factor analysis of fluorescence excitation-emission matrices. The factors influencing DOM florescence characteristics, especially the influence of cascade damming and frozen soil and freeze-thaw cycles, were explored. Our results demonstrated that the DOM fluorescence characteristics and sources of the river-reservoir system in the upper Yellow River had obvious temporal and spatial heterogeneity. Two humus-like substances (C1, C2) and one tryptophan-like substance (C3) were identified in the dry period. The fluorescence intensity of the cascade reservoir section (CR) was higher compared with the source region section (SR). External input and internal generation were the main sources of DOM, and the cascade reservoirs showed strong internal source characteristics. Two humus-like components (C1 and C2) were identified in the flood period, and the fluorescence intensity of the SR was higher compared with the CR. External input was the main source of DOM and the SR showed strong exogenous characteristics. The cascade reservoirs and seasonal freezing and thawing of frozen soil affected the fluorescence characteristics and sources of DOM. This study advances our knowledge of DOM florescence characteristics, sources, and influencing factors in river-reservoir systems in high altitude and severe cold climate regions.					; Wang, Jiawei/Q-3262-2019	Wu, Wei/0000-0002-6625-2222; 													1092-8758	1557-9018				FEB 1	2023	40	2					71	81		10.1089/ees.2022.0088	http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/ees.2022.0088													WOS:000930611300004

Important differences in fecundity and oocyte size were observed among populations and within the same population between successive years. An inverse correlation was found between size and number of oocytes produced by females. This inverse relationship occurred for a constant spawn weight during the first year of study, but not during the second year. Monthly mean residuals of regressions between fecundity and female body weight have shown a seasonal variation in fecundity. The peak of fecundity corresponded with the maximum resource availability and the flooding eminence, which may have a great impact on parents and offspring fitness.

J	Srinivasan, PT; Viraraghavan, T				Srinivasan, PT; Viraraghavan, T			Characterisation and concentration profile of aluminium during drinking-water treatment	WATER SA												An aluminium(Al) characterisation study was conducted at a surface water treatment plant (Buffalo Pound Water Treatment Plant (BPWTP) in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, Canada) to understand better the effect of alum coagulant on various Al fractions. The raw water source for BPWTP is Buffalo Pound Lake water. The Al sources at BPWTP are: present naturally Al in the raw water and Al derived due to use of alum as a coagulant. Seasonal evaluations of Al at BPWTP showed that raw lake water total concentrations were highly variable. Suspended (filterable) Al was the predominant species of raw water total Al. Organic-bound or organo-Al complex Al appeared to be the predominant species of dissolved Al in both raw and treated water during the September to November 1997 Al characterisation study. However, during October to December 1998, inorganic Al dominated dissolved Al content. Characterisation of Al at BPWTP showed that the use of (liquid) Al sulphate (alum) did not increase the concentration of total Al levels. This was because: alum coagulation was practised at pH 7, at which the Al is least soluble clarifier and filtration units effectively removed particulate Al and granular activated carbon (GAC) was capable of removing part of the organic dissolved Al. The study showed that BPWTP would be able to comply with the requirement of Health Canada Guideline value (for conventional treatment plants) for Al of less than 100 mug/l as total Al. Turbidity and dissolved organic carbon of the raw water influenced the applied alum dose at BPWTP.																			0378-4738					JAN	2002	28	1					99	106																WOS:000173910400013
J	Wagner, B; Melles, M				Wagner, B; Melles, M			A Holocene seabird record from Raffles So sediments, East Greenland, in response to climatic and oceanic changes	BOREAS												A 3.5-m-long sediment sequence from a lake on Raffles empty set. off Liverpool Land. East Greenland. was investigated for chronology. lithology. palynology and biogeochemistry. Radiocarbon-dating of plant remains and the lithology,, of the sediment succession indicate continuous sedimentation since deglaciation of the area prior to 10 000 cal. yr BP. The postglacial palynological record shows little variation and evidence of a wind-transported pollen supply. both resulting from the geographical characteristics of Raffles empty set. Significant variations in the biogeochemical data reflect changes in aquatic bioproduction. These changes depend to some extent on climatic changes; however. they are mainly due to variations in seabird breeding colonies in the catchment which influence nutrient and cadmium Supply to the lake. Large seabird breeding colonic, were present between 7500 and 1900, from 1000 to 500. and since c. 100 cal. yr BP. Their absence prior to 7500 cal. yr BP may be the result Of unsuitable feeding conditions close to Raffles empty set caused by a too dense or too open sea-ice cover, In contrast. between 1900 and 1000 and from 500 to 100 cal. vr B.P. the seabird settlement was probably restricted by an insufficiently long breeding season due to cold climate conditions in East Greenland.

The lake was subjected to an experimental drawdown of 1.4 m in 1995 and 0.75 m in 1996 at the time tracking started. We used a radio-linked, acoustic positioning system that produced positions every 100 s for 18 tagged lake whitefish, eight of which provided depth information. Fish position and depth were put into a geographic information system database with information on substratum, slope, and depth. Mean daily locomotor activity declined as the spawning season progressed. Two patterns of behavior occurred in both years. Offshore-oriented fish spent their time along bottom contours, which increased in depth through the spawning season. Inshore-oriented fish spent their time along the shoreline, and exhibited site fidelity during spawning before moving to deeper offshore areas, where movement was reduced. For inshore-oriented fish, spawning positions were determined based on their presence in the littoral zone and a low instantaneous swimming speed of less than 6 cm/s. For these positions, only three substrata-boulder, cobble, and detritus-comprised 50% of these locations. Mean depth ranged from 2.7 m (+/-1.3, SD) to 3.5 m (+/-1.2) with mean slopes of 36% (+/-13.2%). We confirmed spawning by recapturing spent tagged fish; scuba divers also confirmed the presence of lake whitefish eggs at one site. Water level reductions apparently caused mortality of eggs laid at depths less than 3.5 m. Overall, lake whitefish displayed high fidelity toward specific substrate and slope characteristics, using new sites as water levels rose.

J	Arnott, SE; Magnuson, JJ; Yan, ND				Arnott, SE; Magnuson, JJ; Yan, ND			Crustacean zooplankton species richness: single- and multiple-year estimates	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Richness estimates are dependent on the spatial and temporal extent of the sampling programme and the method used to predict richness. We assessed crustacean zooplankton richness in eight Canadian Shield lakes at different temporal and spatial scales using three methods of estimation: cumulative, asymptotic, and Chao's index. Percent species detected increased with the number of spatial, intraannual, or interannual samples taken. Single samples detected 50% of the annual species pool and 33% of the total estimated species pool. This suggests that previous estimates of zooplankton richness, based on single samples in individual lakes, are too low. Our richness estimates for individual lakes approach the total number of zooplankton found in some regions of Canada, suggesting that each lake has most taxa at some time, the majority being very rare. Single-year richness estimates provided poor predictions of multiple-year richness. The relationship between richness and environmental variables was dependent on the method of estimation and the number of samples used. We conclude that richness should be treated as an "index" rather than an absolute and sampling efforts should be standardized. We recommend an asymptotic approach to estimate zooplankton richness because the number of samples taken influenced it less.					; Yan, Norman/H-5235-2013	Arnott, Shelley/0000-0002-3834-703X; Yan, Norman/0000-0003-4870-6865													0706-652X	1205-7533				JUL	1998	55	7					1573	1582		10.1139/cjfas-55-7-1573	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-55-7-1573													WOS:000076176300003

The observations were carried out in Lake Biwa, Japan approximately once a month for a Year. A remarkable linear relationship vas observed between the rate of O-2 production and C fixation to ETR at low-to-medium irradiances during the sampling period, but not at higher irradiances. The annual average O-2 production/ETR and C fixation/ETR ratios at low-to-medium irradiances were 0.117 and 0.095. respectively, and the photosynthetic quotient (O-2 production/C fixation) calculated from the two ratios was 1.23, which is the most common value as the photosynthetic quotient. The same was true for Cultured algal species. These results indicate that the O-2 production/ETR and C fixation/ETR ratios are reliable values at low-to-medium irradiances. and that PAM measurements call be used to quantify primary production rates based oil traditional methods using the ratios. However. it Must be noted that the determination of the average O-2 production/ETR and C fixation/ETR ratios in a natural phytoplankton community requires long-term observation because those ratios Change seasonally over a certain range.																			1863-9135						2008	172	2					121	134		10.1127/1863-9135/2008/0172-0121	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/1863-9135/2008/0172-0121													WOS:000259369800004

Sampling was carried out during the breeding seasons of 2001 to 2005 by mist-netting. We analyzed data of more than 20,000 capture and recapture records belonging to four species (Moustached Warbler Acrocephalus melanopogon, Sedge Warbler Acrocephalus schoenobaenus, Reed Warbler Acrocephalus scirpaceus, and Great Reed Warbler Acrocephalus arundinaceus), differentiated between age and sex groups. The landscape-scale site fidelity varied significantly between both the four species and the age groups. Of the four species, the Moustached Warbler showed the highest returning rate, which could be explained by the strong habitat preference of this species that may have resulted in lower dispersal rate. Also, in the case of all species, adults showed 4.03 to 6.10 times higher returning rate than juveniles. Adult males were more faithful to their breeding area than females, which is likely to be explained by the higher breeding dispersion rate of females. The natal site fidelity of males was higher than that of females in the case of all species but the Moustached Warbler, which could probably be caused by the higher mortality of males between fledging and their first breeding season. In general, adults showed preference for occupying the same territory or its close neighbourhood in consecutive years.																			1217-8837						2008	54						167	175																WOS:000266462100017

The vertical distribution of runoff and its suspended load in lake Malawi	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Lake Malawi, in south-eastern Africa, is subject to increasing loading of suspended solids caused by land use pressure in its watershed. Whether this load is transported into the lake as overflow, interflow or deep underflow determines to a large extent its effect on the lake ecosystem. In this paper, vertical distributions of suspended solids in the Linthipe River delta region of the lake are described from multiple surveys during two rainy seasons. These data are supplemented by data from a single survey near four northern rivers also tributary to the lake. Profiles of temperature, conductance, and suspended solids concentrations (SSC, estimated from optical backscatter and beam transmission) are used to identify fluvial intrusions into the water column. Most in flow plunged to the seasonal metalimnion where it spread along high density gradients as interflow. While SSC in surface plumes rarely exceeded 10 g m(-3), and in intrusions in the lower metalimnion was rarely greater than 1 g m(-3), concentrations up to 420 g m(-3) were recorded in interflow near the thermocline. Although storm runoff density often exceeded 100 in depth-equivalence in the lake, underflow density was reduced to metalimnion-equivalence (30-50 in depth) within a few 100s of meters of the river mouth. We attribute bottom-attached turbid lawyers, and the few unattached turbid layers in the lower metalimnion, all with positive conductance anomalies, to sediment resuspension and not to runoff. We conclude that the upper metalimnion is the prevailing pathway carrying watershed runoff horizontally throughout Lake Malawi.

The model describes the concentration in the mysid as a function of time as it grows and its lipid content changes over a two-year life span. The model can describe uptake in varying proportions from pelagic and benthic sources. Four mysid scenarios are considered: entirely pelagic, entirely benthic, half-pelagic and half-benthic, and following the observed seasonal behavior patterns. The seasonal-scenario mysid yields results consistent with levels of total polychlorinated biphenyls reported for Lake Ontario (Canada/USA). The relative sediment and water fugacities are shown to play a critical role in determining the contamination level in mysids. Inclusion of mysids in a simple food-web model demonstrates higher concentrations in upper-trophic-level organisms by two effects: introduction of another trophic level in the food web, and increased benthic-pelagic coupling.

Top-down controls through increased consumption have sometimes effectively controlled phytoplankton blooms. However, mechanistic insights, especially on possible trophic cascades, are less understood in brackish, species-poor coastal waters, where large cladocera are absent. In this study, we set-up large mesocosms for three consecutive years during the growing season. One set of mesocosms contained mesopredators (gobies and shrimps), whereas the other mesocosms had no such mesopredator present. The results were standardized to monitoring data from the ecosystem to track possible differences between treatments and the system. We found that mesopredator mesocosms showed lower turbidity, phytoplankton biomass and nutrients compared to no-mesopredator mesocosms, and compared to the ecosystem. This decrease allowed macrophytes to colonize water depths only sparsely colonized in the ecosystem. Rotifer biomass increased in mesopredator mesocosms compared to the ecosystem and to the no-mesopredator mesocosms. Likewise, copepod biomass that potentially grazes upon rotifers and other microzooplankton decreased in mesopredator mesocosms. No-mesopredator mesocosms were colonized by an omnivorous mesograzer Gammarus tigrinus, potentially creating additional pressure on macrophytes and increasing grazing-mediated nutrient release. Zooplankton was not able to control the non-nutrient limited phytoplankton. We propose a new mechanism, where a higher mesopredator density will increase grazing on phytoplankton by promoting microzooplankton capable of grazing on picophytoplankton. This proposed mechanism would contrast with freshwater systems, where a decrease of zooplanktivorous fish would promote larger phytoplankton grazer like cladocera. Biomanipulation in such species-poor eutrophic coastal waters may be more successful, due to less trophic pathways, that can cause complex top-down controls like in other systems. Stocking eutrophic coastal waters with gobies and shrimps may be an alternative biomanipulative approach rather than selectively removing large piscivorous or omnivorous fish from eutrophic coastal waters.					; Berthold, Maximilian/Q-3844-2019	Berthold, Maximilian/0000-0003-1985-6426; Schumann, Rhena/0000-0002-0605-3379													0030-1299	1600-0706				APR	2023	2023	4								10.1111/oik.09469	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/oik.09469		JAN 2023											WOS:000919752300001
J	Kappes, H; Sinsch, U				Kappes, H; Sinsch, U			Temperature- and predator-induced phenotypic plasticity in Bosmina cornuta and B-pellucida (Crustacea: Cladocera)	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Clones of Bosmina cornuta and B. pellucida (B. longirostris species complex) were derived from samples collected from Scheuermuhlenteich and Lake Windsborn(westernGermany). Experimental temperature change (to 10 degreesC and 20 degreesC) and exposure to Acanthocyclops vernalis copepods (12 L-1) significantly altered external morphology in laboratory cultures of the two species. Morphological traits were derived from eight log(10)-transformed and standardised morphometric distances by factorial analysis: factor 1 represented body size, factor 2, size of appendages and factor 3, the head size. 2. Acclimation of clones to cold water (10 degreesC, >14 days) led to an increase in body, antennule and mucrone size in B. cornuta and B. pellucida. Moreover, at 10 degreesC, B. cornuta cultures usually collapsed within a few weeks. Compared to the trials at 10 degreesC, acclimation to 20 degreesC (the two species) and to 15 degreesC ( B. pellucida only) left the size of body appendages unchanged. Individuals were unequivocally assigned to each species by discriminant functions. Conspecific individuals that were acclimated to different temperatures between 10 and 20 degreesC also differed in external morphology, but discriminant analysis yielded misclassification rates of 5.3-23.3%. 3. Morphological response to the presence of copepod predators was weaker than that caused by temperature change. Long-term exposure of clones to copepod predators induced a significant increase in size of appendages in the two species but left body size unaffected. Again, species identification by discriminant functions could be made without any error, whereas conspecific controls and experimentals were misclassified at rates between 19.4 and 29.5%. 4. It is suggested that temperature is the main proximal cue for Bosmina cyclomorphosis. The distinct response to temperature of B. pellucida and B. cornuta may also account for seasonal differences in abundance observed in field.

J	Croteau, MN; Hare, L; Tessier, A				Croteau, MN; Hare, L; Tessier, A			Influence of temperature on Cd accumulation by species of the biomonitor Chaoborus	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We exposed larvae of several species of the phantom midge Chaoborus to the trace metal cadmium (Cd) to determine whether Cd accumulation rates varied with ambient temperature. Because this predator is known to accumulate its Cd mainly from food rather than from water, we presented the Cd in food, that is, Cd-rich copepods taken from a lake near a metal smelter. Rates of Cd accumulation by larvae of Chaoborus americanus, C flavicans, and C. punctipennis were measured at three temperatures (5, 14, and 22degreesC) covering the seasonal range encountered by these animals. The rates at which all species accumulated Cd increased with temperature. To explain these results, we fit our experimental data to a bioaccumulation model that allowed us to estimate Cd assimilation efficiency, Cd-efflux rate, and larval growth rate. Temperature-related changes in Cd accumulation rates were best explained by changes in the rate at which Chaoborus larvae ingested prey as well as the efficiency with which they assimilated Cd from their food. Neither the rate of larval growth nor the rate at which larvae lost Cd was influenced by temperature. Extrapolations of our laboratory results to the field suggest that our model results provide a realistic representation of the processes involved in Cd accumulation by larvae of this common aquatic insect.

I improvement purposes. We calibrated our model using field data on the japonica For water quality growth. reproduction. and mortality of P.japonica individuals collected over one growing season in 1997 (May-October). The model effectively predicted seasonal changes in the number of the individuals (r(2)=0.89), aboveground biomass (r(2) = 0.85). and nitrogen concentration (r(2) = 0.91). Total nitrogen. however. was poorly explained by Our model (r(2) = 0.53). To evaluate the effects of biomass removal (e.g. harvest or grazing) on Phragmites management strategies, removal was simulated by manipulating the intensity and period of biomass loss. Distinct patterns in population density and biomass were produced in intensity-period phase planes. suggesting that population dynamics are influenced by a strong relationship between disturbance intensity and period. In addition, the highest rates of nitrogen removal by P. japonica occurred for high-density populations that maintained relatively lock biomass levels. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The five case studies involved three contiguous watersheds of Michoacan State and provided a trophic state variation from mesotrophic to hypereutrophic; the case studies included Lakes Zirahuen, Patzcuaro, Teremendo, Cuitzeo and the Cointzio Reservoir. The fieldwork involved the collection of physical and chemical data (including nutrients) from each case study during the dry and rainy seasons of 2010. Additionally, water samples (1 L) were obtained and filtered (0.45 mu m) in the laboratory to keep the nutrient content available for bioassays. The chemical analyses suggested a phosphorus (P) limitation in the Cointzio Reservoir, Lake Teremendo and Lake Zirahuen relative to an N: P> 16:1. There was a nitrogen (N) limitation at three sampling stations of Lake Patzcuaro, with an N: P<16: 1. As result of the bioassays conducted in July 2012, the Cointzio Reservoir and Lake Teremendo appeared to be P-limited and Lake Patzcuaro appeared to be N-limited at three sampling stations. Lake Zirahuan showed seasonal variation, with an N limitation during the dry season and a P limitation during the wet season. Those cases with similar results from both methods confirmed the limiting nutrient identification. Lake Cuitzeo, Lake Zirahuen (dry season), and the shallowest sampling station in Lake Patzcuaro produced unclear results because of divergent outcomes. In terms of the algal growth potential, the Cointzio Reservoir remained unaltered from one season to the next. However, for most of the lakes (with the exception of Lake Patzcuaro sites 2 and 4), the rainy season provided a dilution effect. Effective lake management depends on a clear recognition of such elements that are in control of the aquatic productivity. In the area of Michoacan, both N and P may act as limiting nutrients.					; Bravo-Inclán, Luis/AAE-3940-2019	Bravo-Inclan, Luis Alberto/0000-0003-0986-8626; Hernandez Morales, Ruben/0009-0007-5111-2896													1129-5767	1723-8633					2016	75			1			169	178		10.4081/jlimnol.2016.1439	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2016.1439													WOS:000375715100017

Channel Catfish Habitat Use and Diet in the Middle Mississippi River	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												River modifications have had detrimental effects on biota that depend on river systems; therefore, information is needed to understand these effects and direct management efforts. Channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) are important recreationally, commercially, and ecologically in the Middle Mississippi River (MMR), but few studies have examined their habitat requirements, and food habits have not been evaluated in the MMR. Information about habitat use and food habits could help direct management efforts for channel catfish. To more thoroughly understand the synergistic relation between channel catfish and the associated habitat, we used data from the United States Army Corps of Engineer's Long-Term Resource Monitoring Program to evaluate channel catfish use of large-scale river features (i.e., macrohabitats) and more fine scale mesohabitats (i.e., substrate type, depth, and velocity). Stomach contents from channel catfish were identified and quantified to determine the relative importance of specific prey items in diets. Channel catfish presence was positively affected by current but negatively affected by depth. Off-channel habitats appeared more suitable for channel catfish. In terms of food habits, Cambaridae, fish, and vegetation were most frequently found in the diet, but a variety of other food items were consumed. Conserving premodification habitat characteristics, such as open side channels, shallow sandbars, and seasonally inundated floodplains, as well as habitats with high forage productivity, should help to sustain a stable population of channel catfish in the MMR. Future studies could examine the tenets of the optimal foraging theory within these habitats to determine the mechanisms regulating channel catfish habitat use and prey selection.																			0003-0031	1938-4238				JAN	2016	175	1					47	54																WOS:000376748900004

In addition to this, scarcity of in situ measurements combined with scale limitations of traditional methods used in its hydrological characterization further makes it hard to assess and manage this vital water resource. The primary objective of this study is to apply remotely sensed and modeled data over the lake area in order to investigate the inter-annual and seasonal terrestrial water storage changes within the lake area and its effect on the lake's surface water. The data used in this study includes; monthly gravity field data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission from which water storage trends within the basin were determined, Rainfall data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) shows an increase in seasonal pattern of rainfall in this area. This study, covers a period from 2003-2013. Results show that GRACE Terrestrial Water Storage within the basin has been somewhat stable with the highest averaged values at 0.69 cm/year occurring in 2012. Correlation analysis indicated a time lag of about a month exists between TWS and rainfall. To understand the possible causes and effects these changes has on the surface water of the lake, investigations using Landsat imagery are underway. These results could serve as an insight on the availability of water resources in the Lake Chad Basin and could also provide baseline data which could be used to monitor the lake for current and future management purposes.

Arctic Grayling Movements through a Nature-Like Fishpass in Northern Canada	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Using a PIT detection system and two in-stream, swim-through antennas, we examined the movements of Arctic Grayling Thymallus arcticus through a low-gradient (< 1%), nature-like fishpass that connected two small lakes in the Barrenlands region of northern Canada. We used an ensemble of generalized linear mixed models to evaluate whether passage events (1) were related to fish FL, water depth in the fishpass, and/or temperature in the fishpass; and (2) exhibited any diel patterns. During two seasons, passage events were not related to fish FL or fishpass water temperature; however, the probability of a passage event occurring increased with increases in fishpass depth, which likely served as a proxy for velocity and/or discharge. Most notably, 95% (n = 193/204) of Arctic Grayling passages occurred at night (1800-0559 hours) throughout our study. Although the cause(s) of this diel pattern were not examined directly, we hypothesized that it represented a response to avian predation given the shallow depth of the fishpass and given our observations of daytime avian predation events on Arctic Grayling in the littoral zones of the study lakes. Our results offer novel insights into correlates of Arctic Grayling passage through a fishpass and lay the foundation for future studies to address the hypotheses supported herein with well-designed experiments to determine the mechanisms behind the patterns we observed.

Natural pollution (As, F) and eutrofication (N, P) in the basin of El Divisorio stream, Argentina	PHYTON-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY												The interrelation between hydrochemistry and hydrodinamics was analyzed in the basin of El Divisorio stream. This was to gain undestanding in the magnitude, distribution of toxic ions (As, F) and behaviour in the discharge of main nutrients (P, N) contributing to the eutrofication of Paso de las Piedras Dam. During two years, 47 sites were sampled determining several parameters: geographical position for each sampling point, phreatic level depth, and As, F, PO4 and N-NO3 concentrations. Repeated measures, Fisher test, correlation and regression analysis were applied to all variables. Highly significant space and time differences (P<0.01) with increments of 0.3 m were detected for isohypses. At every site, differences with a variable degree of significance were recognized for chemical parameters (As, F, PO4 and N-NO3). Hydrodinamics behaves mainly in accord with the seasonal rainfall contribution; run off affects some of the hydrochemical parameters giving rise to a variability that influences water quality. N-NO3 and PO4 concentrations are the main factors that cause eutrofication expressed through algae bloom episodes and deterioration of stored water quality. P is the critical element and in the dry periods the highest contribution is through groundwater flux and to a lesser extent by the continuous discharge of surface water. In the period of greater runoff, these elements incorporated to the sedimentary charge as a result of soil erosion, and coming by fertilizers and pesticides are transported in suspension towards the reservoir.																			1851-5657						2016	85						51	62																WOS:000392213300007
J	He, Y; Liu, GX; Pei, GF				He, Yue; Liu, Guo-Xiang; Pei, Guo-Feng			Effect of artificial macrocosms on water characteristics and benthic diatom communities in Donghu Lake, China	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Macrocosm experiments at various scales have been applied in lake eutrophication management worldwide. This study investigated how artificially created macrocosms affect the physicochemical characteristics of lake water, as well as the density, community structure, and biodiversity of benthic diatoms. First, we found that macrocosms were mesotrophic compared to the eutrophic control lake water from March 2012 to February 2013. Second, 148 diatom taxa were recorded across all study sites; both species richness and the number of dominant diatom taxa were higher in the macrocosms, compared with the control lake water. Mean diatom densities in the macrocosms and the control were 8.4 and 21 x 10(9) cells/m(2), respectively. Across all sites and seasons, Achnanthidium minutissimum was the most abundant species and dominant contributor to total abundance (14%). In the macrocosms, other abundant diatom taxa were Cymbella gracilis, Cymbellaaffinis, Gomphonema truncatum, and Gomphoneis olivaceum, all of which are associated with high water quality. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that the variation in benthic diatom communities was strongly related to phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations in macrocosms, but related to pH and total nitrogen in the control. This study suggests that macrocosms created to alter water characteristics have a positive effect on ecosystem biodiversity and function.					; Liu, Guoxiang/L-7413-2019	Liu, Guoxiang/0000-0001-8565-2363; 													0270-5060	2156-6941					2016	31	4					533	542		10.1080/02705060.2016.1187675	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2016.1187675													WOS:000387166100005

SEASONAL SUCCESSION OF THE PHYTOPLANKTON COMMUNITY AND EVALUATION OF WATER QUALITY USING TROPHIC DIATOM INDEX IN A STREAM	OXIDATION COMMUNICATIONS												Phytoplankton species composition, seasonal variation and the factors effecting the variation were studied in this study one-year period, from June 2010 to May 2011. Water samples were collected monthly from four stations. Algae of the stream was determined by the enumaration and identification of the collected samples. A total of 53 phytoplankton taxa were determined, consisting of Bacillariophyta (79%), Chlorophyta (9%), Cyanobacteria (6%), Euglenozoa (4%) and Cryptophyta (2%). Bacillariophyta dominated mostly in species variety. Diatoms are commonly used as bioindicator organisms for evaluating especially freshwater quality. Trophic diaton index (TDI) provides information about trophic levels of the aquatic ecosystem. The water quality of Buyuk Gure Stream in terms of trophic levels was determined according to these 42 diatom taxa by calculating TDI. It was determined that Buyuk Gure Stream has eutrophic state, caused by organic pollution, according to TDI. Ankistrodesmus falcatus was dominant species in June. Total organism numbers reached its highest level in July during the study period. The number of species and diversity of phytoplankton showed seasonal variation, being low in rainy season. Rainfall, light and temperature are expected to be the major factors which influence phytoplankton succession and dominance.

J	Maraslioglu, F				Maraslioglu, F.			ASSESSMENT OF ECOLOGICAL STATUS AND WATER QUALITY BY USING SOME TROPHIC INDICES IN A DAM LAKE	OXIDATION COMMUNICATIONS												The composition and seasonal variations of benthic diatoms of Yedikir Dam Lake were studied using samples collected from two stations between November 2004 and April 2006. The diatom communities were diverse: 81 taxa were found, belonging to the Bacillariophyta. In two sampling stations, the most important occurrence was suddenly the increase of epipelic diatoms in May 2005. It was drived from especially three species; Nitzschia fonticola, Navicula veneta and N. capitata var. hungarica. Trophic Diatom Index (TDI) provides information about trophic levels of the aquatic ecosystem. The water quality of Yedikir Dam Lake in terms of trophic levels was determined according to these 81 diatom taxa by calculating TDI. In particular, it is important that sites in the 'station 2', where the water enters dam from Tersakan stream, are chosen so that the influence of the gross effects of organic pollution on the index is minimised. According to Trophic classification and diversity (TSI, TDI), respectively, ascribed Yedikir Dam Lake to the eutrophic range. Multivariate analyses indicated that both the regional distribution and seasonal variation of benthic diatoms are mainly driven by nutrient concentration. Diatoms are predominantly affected by geochemical characteristics including pH and mineralisation level.

Samples were collected at four sites with different levels of eutrophication, at the dry and rainy seasons of 2014. A total of 93 specimens of P. platana were analyzed. During the rainy season the Grande River site was the only one that showed total Hg values above the legal standards (0,004 mg. L-1) in the water, while in the zooplankton, it was detectable only in the Central Body in the same season. Total Hg observed in fish varied between 0,04 e 0,29 mu g.g(-1), and highest values in fish were found at the Grande River site. The analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) showed an influence of the sites (p=0,000) and total length (p=0.008) on Hg concentrations, suggesting an influence of the environmental conditions on Hg bioaccumulation in the fishes. The successful invasion of P. platana in the Billings Complex suggests that this species is acting as an additional element for the transfer of the total Hg to higher trophic levels.

This study investigated algal taxonomic composition and biomass, and the seasonal variability in the abundance of Arthrospira fusiformis in response to some environmental drivers (e.g. rainfall, salinity and nutrients) using samples collected over an annual cycle. The algal community was composed of a few taxa (15 species), with exclusive dominance of A. fusiformis. Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and dry weight, and abundance of A. fusiformis were notably high and exhibited seasonal variations, with significantly (P<0.05) higher levels of Chl-a and dry weight during the rainy season. The observed strong correlations of algal abundance and biomass with rainfall (positively) and alkalinity-salinity (negatively), probably suggest that hydrological control of the salinity is the major driving force for the seasonal variability of A. fusiformis in the lake.

J	Ozdemir, K				Ozdemir, Kadir			EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION OF TRIHALOMETHANES REMOVAL IN CHLORINATED DRINKING WATER SOURCES WITH CARBON NANOMATERIALS	FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN												In recent years, carbon nanomaterials have been used widely in water treatment technology. This study investigates to the removal of THMs from chlorinated drinking water sources by combined coagulation process using single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). Terkos Lake water (TLW), Buyukcekmece Lake water (BLW) and Ulutan Lake water (ULW) were used as drinking water source in this study. Conventional coagulation using aluminum sulfate (alum) and ferric chloride (FeCl3) was also conducted using TLW, BLW and ULW samples. Also, the chlorination of raw water samples within a reaction time of 168 hours was conducted in accordance with Standard Methods 5710 B. The maximum removal percentages of TTHMs (92%) was observed with combined SWCNTs and FeCl3 in chlorinated TLW, followed by BLW (82%) and ULW (78%). In BLW and ULW, TTHMs removal (86% and 83%) was highest when using FeCl3 +MWCNTs. The TTHMs removal was lowest in ULW (39% for Alum and 45% for FeCl3). On the other hand, the removal of TTHMs increases in the acidic pH levels whereas decreases alkaline pH levels. In the meantime increases the ionic strength result in decreasing the TTHMs removal for chlorinated three water sources. The results reveal that combined coagulation using carbon nanomaterials is effective for the removal of THMs from various types of chlorinated water source waters.																			1018-4619	1610-2304					2016	25	12A					6202	6214																WOS:000392555800071

Visualizing Trade-Offs between Yield and Spawners per Recruit as an Aid to Decision Making	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												There is a fundamental conflict between harvesting fish and conserving their biomass. Managers mediate this conflict with regulations that control fishery methods and amounts of harvest. In most recreational fisheries, aside from closed seasons, the precise control of fishing effort is difficult to achieve because fisher entry into a managed area is often unlimited and because effort can be influenced by both direct and indirect factors. Choosing the best fishing regulations is also complicated by a need to jointly regulate and accommodate the desires of different user groups who share the fishery. Regulations may need to account for (1) low-consumptive uses of fish populations that occur from catch-and-release fishing by recreational anglers and/or (2) both tribal subsistence and commercial fishers. We applied a suite of graphical techniques to data on a shared fishery, that for Walleye Sander vitreus in Mille Lacs Lake, Minnesota, to examine the trade-offs between fishery yield and spawner biomass on a per-recruit basis across a range of harvest tactics, so that fisheries managers could simultaneously evaluate a variety of regulations. We also used Bluegill Lepomis macrochirus data from several Minnesota lakes to further evaluate the utility of our approach. Some regulations were uniformly better than others because they provided higher yield for a given spawning biomass, and higher spawning biomass for a given yield at equilibrium, under a range of plausible levels of fishing effort. For a given level of fishing effort, we were able to identify a frontier in the yield-biomass space whereby an increase in either the yield or the biomass could only be achieved by a reduction in the other. In the absence of density-dependent changes to growth, maturity, or mortality, regulations that included a minimum length produced more optimal yield and spawner biomass than those that did not include a minimum length. We reduced the daunting task of choosing from dozens of regulations by considering just a few graphs that best demonstrated the trade-offs offered by a suite of regulations.

The wetlands provide an important range of ecosystem services. Poyang Lake is subject to seasonal fluctuations, with changes in water levels apparent in seasonal, yearly and multi-year patterns. However, the lake is shallow, and the pronounced changes in water levels could lead to the large alterations in the wetlands landscape. Satellite radar altimetry has effectively been used for monitoring the water level change in recent years. This article focuses on the estimation of the fluctuation of Poyang Lake water level using level 2 geophysical data record (GDR) altimeter datasets from Cryosat-2/ Siral in recent 6 years from 2010 to 2015. The altimeter datasets were extracted according the MODIS water product image. The abnormal water levels data were eliminated according to the Pauta criterion and Lomnaofski norm. The final water level results were interpolated using B-Spline to get the water level change trend and compared to the 6 hydrology stations' record. At last, the fluctuation trend in the past 6 years was analyzed using long-term trend estimation methods.

This species was present in both dam reservoirs during all 4 seasons. The highest mean density of C. hirundinella in Kralkizi Dam Reservoir was recorded in December, while in Dicle Dam Reservoir it was highest in June. C. hirundinella cells had a fourth horn in both dam reservoirs during the study period, and morphologically they showed the highest relative standard deviation in the fourth horn. In addition, a new fifth horn occurred on some cells, always between the antapical and postequatorial horns. Total length, length of antapical horn, and length of the fourth horn of C. hirundinella displayed significant seasonal variations (P < 0.05). The total cell length showed significant correlations with the length of the apical horn and the length of the antapical horn.

Specimens were collected from the Vaal Dam and Vaal River Barrage in the Gauteng Province, South Africa, for a two-year period. Data were analysed statistically. There was a positive correlation between the host's physical dimensions and the size of the parasite. Larger fish had larger parasites than smaller ones. Parasites from both sites preferred the fourth gill and the median part of the gill arch for attachment. There was no significant host gender preference by parasites. A similar seasonal pattern was observed in the prevalence, abundance, and mean intensity at both localities. This study shows that some aspects of the ecology of the parasite are influenced by the host to which it attaches. Its attachment-site preference was also determined by the position of the gill on the gill chamber. The parasite abundance and prevalence were neither dependent on the size of the host nor influenced by the water quality.

By permitting the ice to sublimate in the SEM at temperatures between - 115degrees and - 60degreesC, enough ions are produced to prevent specimen charging. The absence of a conductive coating permits both the acquisition of uncompromised X-ray spectra, and a dynamic view of impurities as the ice sublimates. The method has enabled us to examine the microstructure and impurities in ice in ways not possible through standard melt chemistry measurements or even through using a SEM to study coated samples. Soluble impurities appeared either as white spots in grain interiors, grain boundaries, and triple junctions, or as filaments in grain boundaries. Inclusions of insoluble impurities have also been observed in natural ice. Thus, we have been able to compare the microstructural location and concentration of impurities in ice from different terrestrial locations. Even when ion chromatography of the melt from two core sections reveals similar levels of impurities, the morphology and location of the impurity aggregates can be quite different. Analysis of impurity type and location can provide clues to the depositional environment and history of the ice.

In recent years, the climate change has affected the flow field in Lake Biwa. However, how much the climate change can influence the flow field has not been clarified enough yet. In the present study, using a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model, we investigated the effect of changes in air temperature, wind speed, and precipitation on the change of the flow field in Lake Biwa. For sensitivity analysis, numerical simulations were performed for a baseline case using realistic meteorological data from 2007 to 2012, as well as hypothetical cases using meteorological data. The analysis revealed that the change in air temperature and precipitation changed stratification and vorticity in the surface layer in each season. The strength of the stratification affected the gyre strength in the surface layer. The change in wind speed, on the other hand, changed the wind stress acting on the lake's surface, influencing the strength of gyre significantly. Increased wind speed lengthened the radius of the gyre in Lake Biwa, while decreased wind speed made it weaker above and below the thermocline.					; Koue, Jinichi/HHM-4256-2022	Koue, Jinichi/0000-0003-2542-614X; Shimadera, Hikari/0000-0002-2233-8446; 													1464-7141	1465-1734				MAR	2023	25	2					243	257		10.2166/hydro.2023.075	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/hydro.2023.075		JAN 2023											WOS:000917285600001
J	Schlolaut, G				Schlolaut, Gordon			The Varve Interpolation Program 3.0.0-A unique and easy to use tool for incompletely varved sediments	QUATERNARY GEOCHRONOLOGY												Annually laminated (varved) sediments are particularly interesting for palaeo-environmental reconstruction, since they allow independent, high resolution chronological control. But often varved archives contain intervals in which seasonal layers did not form every year. To construct independent varve chronologies from such archives varve interpolation is required. Here, a significantly advanced Varve Interpolation Program (VIP) is presented, which uses a novel approach to interpolate varves. Through probability distribution fitting the varve thickness frequency distribution of an interval is approximated and used for interpolation. The new approach is superior in many respects to the approach used in the original VIP 1.0.0, but retains all the advantages, such as objectivity, reproducibility and the fact that it does not rely on well varved intervals. The program is designed for common log-normally distributed varve thickness frequency distributions. It is realised in Matlab, but comes with a graphical user interface, which allows easy handling and requires no prior knowledge about Matlab. The program can be run fully automated, but also allows manual control of settings. While the accuracy of the results depends on the characteristics of the data and the degree of varve formation/preservation, the application examples presented here show that under suitable conditions accuracies in the range of 2% can be achieved.																			1871-1014	1878-0350				OCT	2018	48						17	24		10.1016/j.quageo.2018.07.014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quageo.2018.07.014													WOS:000453621600003

Effects of Forest Fire on Young-of-the-year Northern Pike, Esox lucius, in the Northwest Territories	CANADIAN FIELD-NATURALIST												In 1998, a forest fire burned 58% of the forested shoreline surrounding Tibbitt Lake, Northwest Territories, including riparian vegetation used by Northern Pike (Esox lucius) as spawning habitat. This presented an opportunity to investigate the effects that habitat disturbance from a natural forest tire had on young-of-the-year (Y-O-Y) Northern Pike. Pike fry were collected from three burned and three unburned sites around Tibbitt Lake in 1999 (the first post-fire spawning season) and again in 2001. Differences in size and relative abundance were evaluated between sites. Y-O-Y Northern Pike were significantly larger at the unburned sites (P<0.01) and the relative abundance of Y-O-Y Northern Pike increased significantly at burned sites (alpha=0.1; P<0.07) following re-vegetation two years post fire. These differences may be due to fire-induced changes in physical habitat or food availability. Forest tires decrease the density of riparian vegetation, which likely provides better spawning and rearing habitat for Northern Pike in the long-term.																			0008-3550					APR-JUN	2010	124	2					104	112		10.22621/cfn.v124i2.1046	http://dx.doi.org/10.22621/cfn.v124i2.1046													WOS:000291958800002

Toposequential change from summit to lake shore along a subalpine lake (Lake Jialo) was selected to evaluate the influence of high soil moisture conditions on vegetation and pedogenic processes, and to clarify the mechanism of podzolization. Along this toposequence, the podzolization process occurs at all landscape sites except for the one at the lakeshore. Organically-complexed Fe and Al are the dominant forms in the Bs horizons at summit and footslope sites. The fulvic acids complex Fe and Al and translocate the latter downwards into the Bs horizons. The placic horizon in soils at the footslope is dominated by amorphous Fe oxides. Formation of placic horizons is mainly attributed to perched water, which is caused by heavy rainfall and seasonally high lake water level between the AE and Bs horizons. This situation causes Fe reduction and translocation to lower parts of the soil profile, resulting in formation of a placic horizon between E and Bs horizons. The soils towards the lakeshore are characterized by increasing dominance of hydromorphic process over podzolization. However, although the podzolization process occurs, the studied soils cannot be classified as Spodosols. High clay and crystalline Fe oxide contents derived from parent materials retard the mobility of organically-complexed metal cations and thus slow down the podzolization process and formation of spodic horizons in this area.

Phytoplankton community and physico-chemical seasonality and changes in Lake Hora-Kilole, Ethiopia, a tropical crater lake	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												Phytoplankton community structure and physico-chemical variables, sampled monthly at an offshore station in Lake Hora-Kilole from August 2007 to May 2008, were compared with previously reported data. In 1989 the Mojo River was temporarily diverted to flow into the lake. The lake subsequently changed markedly, first from being a small polymictic system to being a large monomictic system with a maximum depth of 29 m in 1990/1991, and then by 2007/2008 to again being a small continuously polymictic system less than 8 m deep. Secchi depth averaged 0.35 m and varied from 0.15 to 0.78 m, indicating a marked decline in water transparency from the levels recorded in 1990/1991. Nitrate levels, rarely detectable in the 1960s, subsequently became high, whereas phosphorus levels have declined since the 1960s. The phytoplankton community was dominated by cyanobacteria and dinoflagellates, in contrast to the dominance by cyanobacteria before 1989, and by dinoflagellates and chlorophytes shortly thereafter. Total phytoplankton Chl a averaged 83.5 mg m(-3) and ranged from similar to 36 to 148 mg m(-3), peaking in October 2007 and February 2008. The impacts of river diversion and shoreline modification on the lake were reflected in changes in the physico-chemical conditions, including low light penetration and high nitrate, and changed phytoplankton community structure. The development of algal blooms in future is anticipated.					; abate, rediat/F-4552-2016; Hailu, Mekonen/JFL-1075-2023	Abate Adilo, Rediat/0000-0002-6035-2548; 													1608-5914	1727-9364					2014	39	1					97	108		10.2989/16085914.2013.867253	http://dx.doi.org/10.2989/16085914.2013.867253													WOS:000334167500010

However, it has never been calculated on the basis of underground supply for Polish Lakes. Due to their high altitudes, the lakes in question constitute a distinctive group among the Leczna-Wlodawa Lakes. They are located in the borderland of the Cretaceous Chelm Hills (part of the Polish Uplands) and Polish Lowland. The quantity of the underground water supply was one of the key factors which make these lakes so distinctive. During periods of low precipitation, water shortages occurred in the lakes, especially Pniowno and Syczynskie. The Leczna-Wlodawa Lakes are commonly distinguished, among other Polish water bodies, as super-passive due to their water flushing time (>10 years). However, the average flushing time of the water in lakes Tarnowskie, Chuteckie, Pniowno and Syczynskie, based on the underground supply, amounted to 606, 211, 54 and 79 days, respectively. The territorial conditions (e.g. geologic structure of catchment areas or thickness of unsaturated and saturated zones) were the most important factors that determined seasonal fluctuations of the supply to the lakes.

J	Gao, J; Yao, TD; Joswiak, D				Gao, Jing; Yao, Tandong; Joswiak, Daniel			Variations of water stable isotopes (δ18O) in two lake basins, southern Tibetan Plateau	ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY												delta O-18 measurements based on systematic sampling and isotopic modeling have been adopted to study the controls of stable isotopes in lake water in two lake basins (lakes Yamdrok-tso and Puma Yum-tso) at two different elevations on the southern Tibetan Plateau. Temporally, delta O-18 values in precipitation and lake water display a seasonal fluctuation in both lakes. Spatially, delta O-18 values in the two lake basins increase by 10 parts per thousand from the termini of glaciers to the lake shores, by similar to 1 parts per thousand from the lake shores to the lake center and by 0.4 parts per thousand from the water surface to depth in these lakes. The clear annual delta O-18 variations indicate that lake water mixes sufficiently in a short time. Model results show that glacial meltwater and surface lake-water temperature are not the dominant factors in the balance process of stable isotopes in lake water. Equilibrium delta O-18 values decrease by 0.8 parts per thousand for Yamdrok-tso lake and 0.6 parts per thousand for Puma Yum-tso lake when glacial meltwater contributions to these lakes shrink by 60%. delta O-18 ratios increase rapidly during the initial stages and take a longer time to approach the equilibrium value.																			0260-3055	1727-5644					2014	55	66					97	104		10.3189/2014AoG66A109	http://dx.doi.org/10.3189/2014AoG66A109													WOS:000336010200013

The samples were taken between 10 m and 17 m from Zapadle lake in North-Eastern Poland between April and November in 2011. Meromictic lakes are important biogeochemical models because of their stratified chemical gradients and separation of redox reactions down the water column. We applied the Direct Epifluorescent Filter Technic (DEFT) and 16S rDNA PCR-DGGE fingerprinting methods. DAPI stained prokaryotic cells were counted measured and sorted by computer image analysis. In addition, the abundance (TCN), biomass (PB), average cell volume (ACV) and morphological structure of cells were determined. DNA was amplified using the universal bacterial primers-pair 341f GC/907r. Highly significant Spearman's rank correlations between total prokaryotic cell number, biomass and BOD, conductivity, total (TOC) and dissolved (DOC) organic carbon were determined. The prokaryotic biomass increased very substantially in the lower part of the monimolimnion. The morphological structure of the cells also changed with depth. Participation-curved forms in the biomass of prokaryotes significantly increased towards the bottom. A significant correlation (p<0.05) between prokaryotic biomass and their anaerobic metabolic products including: NH4 (r=0.75), H2S (r=0.45) and PO4 (r=0.68) was revealed. Multiple stepwise regression analysis showed the following factors determined prokaryotic abundance: conductivity, TN, depth, temperature, Fe, DOC and Norg. (r(2)=0.89, P<0.05), while conductivity, TOC, (HS)-S-2 and PO4 influenced prokaryotic biomass at r(2)=0.92 (P<0.05). Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) indicated that conductivity, H2S, DON. TOC, DOC, N tot, Norg, NH4, Ptot, Porg, PO4, and Mn explained changes in bacterial community structures in June and September, while the most important measured factor in November was temperature. DGGE banding patterns revealed similar bacterial community structures for June and September and slightly different for April.

SMOS time series data were analyzed to examine seasonal variations of soil freezing, and to assess the impact of snow cover and land cover on freeze-thaw cycle. Further, the soil freezing maps derived from SMOS observations compared to microwave active images in the region near Umiujaq and Field survey data. The objective is to develop algorithms to follow the seasonal cycle of freezing and thawing of the soil in the Tundra and Boreal forest. Field data shows that freezing and thawing dates vary much spatially at the local scale in the Boreal Forest and the Tundra. Therefore, the field validation of the F/T state maps at the regional scale will be very important. Agreement Factor derived from comparison of SMOS FT maps with daily in-situ data shows low values which does not seems to be acceptable. New parameters such as lake and pond as well as vegetation type and height present on surface have to be introduced in the algorithm to obtain more realistic estimations.																			2153-6996		978-1-4799-5775-0				2014							2550	2553		10.1109/IGARSS.2014.6946993	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2014.6946993													WOS:000349688103136

It influences strongly the daily maximum surface level ozone concentrations. We utilize Spatial Synoptic Classification methodology, surface ozone simulations from the NOAA National Air Quality Forecast Capability and observations from the US EPA Air Quality System, to investigate the behavior of surface ozone and air quality model's performance in different synoptic weather patterns. This study was conducted for the following six air quality air-shed regions: California (CA), Michigan Lake (MI), Ohio River Valley (OV), Northeastern (NE), Southeastern (SE), and Texas (TX), during the ozone season (May to September) in years 2009-2011. Based on air mass' thermal characteristics and origins, the SSC methodology provides six types of air mass classifications: Dry Polar (DP), Dry Moderate (DM), Dry Tropical (DT), Moisture Polar (MP), Moisture Moderate (MM), and Moisture Tropical (MT). Results show distinct behaviors of ozone's magnitude and model's performance among the various air mass types, implying the impact of synoptic weather patterns to regional air quality, and NAQFC's success in reproducing these patterns. The MT and DT air mass types are the most important types conducive to high surface ozone episodes throughout their occurrence frequency and high ozone production efficiency, respectively. The MT air mass also shows highest in both mean bias and root mean square error, implying the high uncertainty in model performance due to cloudy or unstable atmospheric conditions.

J	Milisa, M; Ivkovic, M; Kepcija, RM				Milisa, Marko; Ivkovic, Marija; Kepcija, Renata Matonickin			Energy resources and feeding guild structure of macroinvertebrate assemblages in the hyporheic zone of calcite depositing lake outlets	LIMNOLOGICA												We investigated the distribution of particulate organic matter (POM) and its relation to flow velocity and tufa deposition rates (TDR) in the 4-10 cm deep zone at tufa barriers. We expected surface conditions affect the hyporheic zone, even in habitats with non-moving substrate in calcite depositing lake outlet streams. Additionally, we analyzed feeding guild structure of macroinvertebrate assemblages against environmental conditions, food resources and predatory abundance. Overall, more POM was deposited in the hyporheic zone of slow flow and low TDR habitats. Mean energy stored in the hyporheic POM was 163.4 kJ dm(-3). While least abundant in mass, coarse POM represented the majority of organic matter energy stock. Coarse particles accumulated more at fast flow habitats and finer particles accumulated more at slow flow habitats. We propose that fast flow partly flushes small particles and partly macroinvertebrate fauna ingests and converts them to larger particles (fecal pellets) and transports them to the hyporheic zone. Collector gatherers dominated the assemblages (76%) and as passive filterers (4%) they thrived at fast flow sites. Grazers were the second dominant feeding guild (14%) and were more abundant at slow flow sites. Surface flow and predation pressure were the most important controls of hyporheic assemblage structuring. POM content was not as important. We propose that in the stable, non-moving tufa hyporheic zone food is plenty for the scarce fauna so macroinvertebrates are more reactive to predatory pressure. Moog's functional feeding guild allocation system, while more complex, proved more suitable for our analyses than classification system derived from Cummins'. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH.

The main goal of this work was thus to describe the present water quality and metazooplankton dynamics and to evaluate the effects of damming on aquatic ecosystem in the super reservoir. The water quality including conductivity, turbidity, Chlorophyll a, dissolved oxygen, total nitrogen, total phosphorus and metazooplankton communities were surveyed along the 30 km away from the dam in the reservoir from 2011 to 2012. Throughout our study, most of the water quality parameters showed clear temporal changes. The total nitrogen and phosphorus showed mean values of 0.9 and 0.04 mg L-1 at different sites. The dominated species of zooplankton showed typical seasonal succession. The most important factor in the determination of zooplankton throughout the year is water temperature and Chlorophyll a. The spatial distribution of water quality parameters and zooplankton communities fluctuated considerably among different sites. However, it is difficult to explain these spatial changes which may relate to the unstable water conditions. Our results showed that the area along the 30 km away from the dam of Xiaowan Reservoir belonged to lake-type environment. More attention should be paid on the aquatic ecosystems of the reservoirs which belong to the gorge area with high mountains and steep valleys.

The influence of biotope and sampling method on the assessment of the invertebrate community structure in endorheic reed pans in South Africa	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												Reed pans in the Mpumalanga Lakes District, South Africa, support an abundant diversity and richness of aquatic macroinvertebrates in a variety of different biotopes which, in the case of depressional wetlands such as reed pans, are not well studied. This study was undertaken from 2008 to 2009 and focused on determining the diversity and richness of aquatic macroinvertebrates supported by various biotopes, as well as identifying a sampling method which is able to retrieve a representative sample of macroinvertebrates from reed pans. Aquatic macroinvertebrates were collected using an aquatic light trap, benthic grab sampler, emergence trap, plankton net, sweep net and terrestrial light trap. Marginal and emergent vegetation were found to have the highest diversity and richness of aquatic macroinvertebrates. A sweep net proved to be the most efficient method for sampling aquatic macroinvertebrate communities in reed pans. By sampling marginal and emergent vegetation with a sweep net, variability between sites and seasons was minimised.					; Wepener, Victor/AAV-2116-2020	Wepener, Victor/0000-0002-9374-7191; 													1608-5914	1727-9364				APR	2011	36	1					67	74	PII 937410273	10.2989/16085914.2011.559705	http://dx.doi.org/10.2989/16085914.2011.559705													WOS:000290411300007

Most studies have shown that animals spend more time for feeding and less time on vigilance when in groups. Apart from group size, additional factors, such as group density, age, sex, and season, are considered to influence vigilance behaviors. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of flock size and human presence on vigilance and feeding in the Eurasian Coot (Fulica atra) during the breeding season. This work was performed in Yorukkirka Lake (Eskisehir, Turkey) from March to August 2005. No correlation was found between flock size and vigilance rates during either human absence or presence. On the other hand, when comparing behavioral differences between human presence and absence, humans appeared to have an important negative effect on vigilance rates, vigilance duration, and feeding behavior, regardless of flock size.

Seasonal variations in mercury concentrations in the coastal waters of Kalpakkam, southeast coast of India	CURRENT SCIENCE												Studies were carried out in the coastal waters of Kalpakkam to monitor the seasonal variation in mercury (Hg) concentration. The Hg level (dissolved + acid leachable) ranged from 3 to 50 ppb for surface and 1.5 to 47.9 ppb for bottom- water samples, yielding an annual average concentration of 20.42 +/- 11.44 and 23.11 +/- 13.06 ppb for surface and bottom waters respectively. Strong positive correlation of Hg with salinity and its relatively low concentrations during monsoon and post-monsoon showed that concentration of Hg in this coastal water was mainly of marine origin, indicating absence of any other external source of input. Relatively high Hg concentrations were encountered in bottom samples compared to the surface. Madras Atomic Power Station (MAPS) outfall discharge water did not show elevated Hg level compared to ambient surroundings. The present observed values are significantly lower (30 times) than the earlier reported values from this coast.					; Natesan, Usha/ABE-4260-2020	NATESAN, USHA/0000-0003-4300-7926; Mohanty, Ajit/0000-0002-0333-0588; 													0011-3891					AUG 10	2008	95	3					374	381																WOS:000258594600031

Response of fish communities in five north temperate lakes to exotic species and climate	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Exotic species invasions and climatic variation that occurred in north central Wisconsin provided the opportunity to contrast influences of climate and invasive species in shaping fish community dynamics in five Wisconsin lakes from 1981 to 2001. Year (passage of time) was positively correlated (r > 0.9) with invasive species. Year, invasive species, and climatic variables were the principal determinants of fish community dynamics according to redundancy analysis (RDA). The same invasive species negatively affected the same general group of species in different lakes; benthic invertivores declined in lakes invaded by crayfish, Orconectes spp., and pelagic zooplanktivores declined in lakes invaded by rainbow smelt, Osmerus mordax. Micropterus dolomieu, Pimephales notatus, and Notropis volucellus increased in abundance in lakes invaded by crayfish. When year was included in RDAs as a covariable (partial RDA), fish community changes in three lakes did not differ significantly from ordinations of Monte Carlo simulated data; for two lakes, growing season length and lake productivity were significant explanatory variables under the reduced model. The resulting shifts in the fish community might represent declines in those species that used resources similar to the invading crayfish and smelt or were eaten by the invading smelt. Subsequent community compensation might have occurred, with other species increasing in response to the declines in species affected directly by the invasive species.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	2006	51	6					2808	2820		10.4319/lo.2006.51.6.2808	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2006.51.6.2808													WOS:000242265700026

The prey types consumed by the two species were generally similar. However, fish were common in the diet of C. crocodilus but absent from the M. niger. Snails (Pomacea) occurred in 24% of stomachs of M. niger, but in only 2% of C. crocodilus. The mean mass of food and the mean proportion of fish consumed increased, while the mean proportion of terrestrial invertebrates decreased significantly with the size class of C. crocodilus. The mean proportion of molluscs consumed increased significantly with the size class of M. niger, but there was no relationship between the mean mass of food or the mean proportion of other prey categories and size class in this species. However, the sample included only subadults. The mean size of all prey consumed, and of fish, increased significantly with size of C. crocodilus. However, there was no relationship between the mean size of prey in the categories terrestrial invertebrates, shrimps, or crabs, and the size of C. crocodilus. The mean size of all prey consumed was positively related to the size of M. niger. The mean mass of food consumed by C. crocodilus varied with the water body type (lake or canal), but there was no effect of season as indexed by the water level of the Rio Negro. Seasonal variation in the proportion of fish, terrestrial invertebrates, and shrimps consumed by C. crocodilus differed among water body types. Empty stomachs occurred in 24% of the C. crocodilus and 20% of the M. niger. Individuals with food in the stomach had eaten small volumes, suggesting that the caiman are unlikely to impact fisheries in the region.

The main objective of this study is to assess the effects of wet coffee processing plants effluent on the physicochemical and bacteriological properties of receiving rivers. Four rivers and 4 sampling points of the selected rivers were included in the study. Focus group discussion and interview were employed to gather primary data. The result showed that parameters of water quality for downstream of the rivers were significant, particularly in the dry season with BODs ranging from 45 +/- 1 to 782.6 +/- 97 g/ml, COD ranges from 71 +/- 21 to 1072 +/- 183 g/ml, Conductivity ranges from 75.5 +/- 6.6 to 943 +/- 56.3, Turbidity ranges from 7 +/- 0.43 to 105 +/- 6.2, TDS ranges from 62 +/- 6.4 to 1059.6 +/- 121 g/ml, temperature ranges from 20.1 to 33 +/- 1, T. coli form ranges from 77 +/- 1.1 to 493 +/- 66 and E. coli ranges from 28 +/- 1 to 213 +/- 41 were significantly higher and DO ranges from 2.6 +/- 0.15 to 6.1 +/- 0.78 g/ml, NH4 ranges from 1.85 +/- 0.4 to 3.3 +/- 0.5 g/ml, and pH ranges from 3.6 +/- 0.2 to 7.3 +/- 0.45 were significantly lower. Most of the samples taken from wastewater and downstream parts of the river showed high level of water contaminants that are significantly greater than the EEPA discharge limits for surface water. Moreover, the qualitative data indicated that the community was affected by bad smell and color change on rivers, skin irritation, malarial case in human due to coffee processing plant effluents. Therefore, coffee processing plants should treat their effluents before they discharge it into the rivers. Responsible government bodies should authorize activities of coffee processing plants in line with the regulations set for environmental safety.

The El Limon reservoir is one of the main reserves of water for consumption in northern Argentina (22 degrees 6 ' 12.29 '' S). This study analyzed the role of abiotic factors in the promotion of blooms in El Limon during warm seasons and explored the physical and chemical parameters affecting the morphological development of the most abundant cyanobacteria species. The results showed that short-term meteorological variations correlated with cyanobacterial abundances in this shallow reservoir. Average daily temperatures for 6 and 8 months before the sampling date were positively correlated with cyanobacterial abundances as well as filament length, while accumulated precipitation limited the abundances of cyanobacteria. Considering the highly probably effects of short-term meteorological factors on cyanobacterial blooms, the results support the need for continuous and periodic monitoring of tropical reservoirs.					; Lozano, Verónica/KWT-7945-2024	Lozano, Veronica Laura/0000-0001-8960-9688; Morana, Liliana/0000-0001-7445-3537; Alvarez Dalinger, Florencia Soledad/0000-0001-9453-3569; 														2073-4441				JAN	2023	15	2							302	10.3390/w15020302	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15020302													WOS:000918978000001

Access to markets is a key factor for economic growth and an important component in reducing poverty. The SDG 9.1.1 addresses the proportion of the rural population who live within 2km of an all-season road, which can be mapped by the Rural Access Index (RAI), introduced by the World Bank in 2006. This requires the road network of so-called all-season roads, population distribution and rural areas. We developed a fully automated approach, using remote sensing and other open source data to calculate the RAI on an annual basis between 2013 and 2020 for the Lake Chad region. We achieved an overall accuracy between 97.0% and 97.5% in detecting all-season roads using a Random Forest classification. Our method shows similar results to those published by the World Bank. However, our approach provides a higher spatial and temporal resolution measuring the RAI compared to previous studies and is independent of field studies.

Private event venues have begun to pay more attention to green space around buildings to provide attendees with green areas to relax and socialize. More and more event locations are located on the city's outskirts, thus offering the opportunity to create perspectives with natural views. In the present work, it was desired to design a private garden for events with multiple purposes (civil weddings, christening parties, marriage parties, corporate parties, etc.), in the Iasi city, Romania, on the shores of Lake Ciric II.

The heterophyllous species resembles R. saniculifolius, R. peltatus, and the Mediterranean forms of R. baudotii. It differs from the aforementioned species by a combination of characters not found in any of them, i.e., 5-6 mm long petals, up to 2.2 mm long, glabrous achenes with a partly persistent style, a densely pubescent, in fruit slightly elongating receptacle, and intermediate leaves with rigid filiform apical segments, being divided into two or three cuneate, shortly petiolate leaflets. A key to all similar East Mediterranean taxa is presented. DNA analyses based on the sequencing of nuclear, ribosomal Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS), and two chloroplast noncoding regions (rpl32-trnL and psbE-petL), complemented by the analysis of genome-wide polymorphism using double digest RAD Sequencing (ddRADseq) supported that Ranunculus dahlgreniae is a distinct lineage, clearly separated from R. peltatus, R. baudotii, and R. saniculifolius. The phylogeny based on ddRADseq resembles the topologies obtained from chloroplast and nrITS data but with increasing resolution and support of fine-scale relationships. Extensive sampling, including taxa from temperate Europe and the West Mediterranean area, as well as the application of reduced-representation sequencing, allowed to better understand the pattern of diversity in the section Batrachium.					; Zalewska-Gałosz, Joanna/HJP-0765-2023	Wiegleb, Gerhard/0000-0003-4094-317X; Babik, Wieslaw/0000-0002-1698-6615; Zalewska-Galosz, Joanna/0000-0002-6473-4893													0001-6977	2083-9480					2023	92								167462	10.5586/asbp/167462	http://dx.doi.org/10.5586/asbp/167462													WOS:001145294300001

This study investigated the seasonal variation of water quality parameters, heavy metal pollution in surface water and sediment, as well as the ecological risk change in crab ponds in Hung-tse Lake, China. The results indicated that nitrogen, phosphorus, etc. in surface water were obviously increased during the growing period of crab. The concentrations of Cr, Cu, Zn, As, Cd, and Pb in surface water ranged from 0.01 to 62.53 mu g/L, without significant difference compared with that in watercourse. However, aquaculture significantly exacerbated the accumulation of Cr, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb in sediment with a concentration range of 0.16-130.66 mg/kg (p < 0.05). Multivariate statistical analysis showed that aquaculture not only resulted in the excessive accumulation of Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb from anthropogenic source but also Cr and As from natural or semi-natural source. Geoaccumulation index was in the range of - 1.80-1.78, indicating that heavy metal pollution by crab aquaculture reached moderate level. Risk index ranged from 116.01 to 159.79 showing a gradually increasing moderate ecological risk during the growth period of aquatic products.					; Cui, Hao/P-2709-2017; cui, hao/P-2709-2017	Li, Jiping/0000-0003-2868-2456; Cui, Hao/0000-0002-9417-5068; 													0049-6979	1573-2932				JAN	2023	234	1							53	10.1007/s11270-022-06048-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-022-06048-z													WOS:000913515100006

The dataset includes 27,455 records of 957 taxa (subspecies: 39; species: 819; species group: 1; genus: 81; family: 17), gathered from 706 published papers. The published literature spans from 1854 to 2022, with the highest number of records in the decades 1990-1999 and 2010-2019. The African countries with the highest number of taxa are Nigeria, Algeria, South Africa, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, whereas no records are yet available for a dozen countries. The number of species known from each country can be explained mostly by sampling efforts, measured as the number of papers published for each country up to now.

NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The National Wetland Trust constructed a 1400 m long pest exclusion fence around a 11 hectare site at Rotopiko and all mammals except mice have been eradicated from inside the fenced area. Since the completion of the pest proof fence, the number of roosting birds has increased dramatically. By removing mammalian pests, an unexpected sanctuary has been created for communal roosting birds such as starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) and sparrows (Passer domesticus). There is growing concern about the large amounts of bird faeces produced each day and the associated nutrient load particularly as the pest fence encircles a low nutrient peat lake. In this study two methods were developed for estimating the relative abundance of the large roosting congregation, based on (1) gridded plates for gathering guano and (2) the acoustic energy of the roost cacophony. The results showed that these methods were suitable for measuring the characteristics of the roosting community at multiple scales. For example, large variance in the abundance of roosting and diurnal birds, and minor changes in the roosting community according to seasonal fluctuations. The methods could support the management of the issue through being applied to assess and quantify the relative efficacy of preventive or control methods deployed to reduce the number of exotic birds. The findings of this study are site specific; however, the guano plates and sound recorders could be implemented to estimate large bird numbers at other sites facing a roosting bird problem.																			0110-6465	1177-7788					2023	47	1								10.20417/nzjecol.47.3513	http://dx.doi.org/10.20417/nzjecol.47.3513													WOS:000933626000015
J	Turan, A; Aldemir, A				Turan, Aysenur; Aldemir, Adnan			Statistical assessment of seasonal variations in water quality for different regions in Lake Van (Turkiye)	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												On earth, surface water bodies interact and change with the natural ecosystems. These surface waters and water quality may be adversely affected due to different factors. To analyze the effects, parameters indicating water pollution and quality and the possible causes of these parameters should be examined. In addition, environmental pollution issues should be controlled by taking measures. The most important surface water body in the province of Van, located in the east of Turkiye, is the biggest soda Lake Van. The population density around the lake, human polluting factors, unconscious beach use, inadequate wastewater treatment, agriculture and livestock activities, small-scale industrial areas, and chemicals used create a pollution effect. In the study, data were obtained during year of 2018 from six important sampling points around Lake Van and from the middle of the lake. Twenty-seven water quality parameters were analyzed separately and together. These variables' yearly values were evaluated with Turkish Surface Water Quality Regulation (TSWQR, 2015). As a result, these points were determined to have class I in terms of water parameters according to the seasonal data. The basic descriptive statistics were compared with the regulation, and max, mean, and min values were examined. Data analyzed were done with probability-normality, trend analysis, correlation, and regression methods. The results of this study are that general parameters were normal and the quality of the six points continued to be similar. Na+, Cl-, salinity, and TDS were highly correlated, while DO and F were high matrix value parameters. EC, TDS, and SS regression equations provided high correlation parameters.

Dietary patterns of five freshwater fish species in a large Mediterranean lake	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												The diet of five freshwater fish species of Lake Trichonis, the largest natural lake of Greece, was studied. Specifically, the studied species were Atherina boyeri, Luciobarbus albanicus, Leucos panosi, Scardinius acarnanicus and Tropidophoxinellus hellenicus. The diet analysis was based on stomach content analysis of seasonal samples collected during 2019 by experimental Nordic multimesh gillnets. Additionally, trophic indices were estimated (Shannon-Wiener, Levins', Schoener, Trophic level) so as to investigate each species' feeding diversity, trophic niche breadth, trophic level as well as their trophic competition and overlap. Moreover, the annual and the seasonal relative condition factor was estimated. The diet analysis indicated a tendency of the studied species to omnivorous feeding strategy and a seasonal fluctuation in their diet composition. In addition, the estimated trophic indices revealed similar feeding behavior and significant diet overlap between species, suggesting narrow partitioning of the food resources. However, the relative condition factor ranged between 0.973 and 1.041, indicating a state of wellbeing for the fish species and possibly sufficient food availability.					; PETRIKI, OLGA/I-6493-2018; Karachle, Paraskevi/AAA-1558-2020	Vagenas, Georgios/0000-0001-5359-1084; Stoumboudi, Maria/0000-0002-2173-9328; Karachle, Paraskevi/0000-0002-6934-1773; Tsionki, Ioanna/0000-0003-3338-9924													0270-5060	2156-6941				DEC 31	2022	37	1					203	220		10.1080/02705060.2022.2034674	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2022.2034674													WOS:000769583100001

Contrasting total carbon stocks between ecological site series in a subboreal spruce research forest in central British Columbia	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH												A study was conducted to determine if consideration of ecological site classification in combination with stand age would describe total ecosystem carbon (C) better than consideration of just stand age alone. The research was conducted in the 9250 ha University of Northern British Columbia/The University of British Columbia Aleza Lake Research Forest in central British Columbia. Over three field seasons (2003-2005), 38, 72, and 27 plots were established in mesic, subhygric, and hygric stands, respectively, with stand ages ranging from 5 to 350+ years. Mineral soil C stocks were significantly influenced by moisture regime, where hygric > subhygric > mesic (93, 77, and 65 t C.ha(-1), respectively). Mineral soil and forest floor C stocks were not related to stand age, indicating their resilience to partial-cut and clear-cut forest harvesting systems historically implemented throughout the study area. Subhygric stands had the highest total ecosystem C stocks in the Aleza Lake Research Forest, having approximately 18% more C than mesic and hygric stands, principally due to higher mineral soil C stocks (than mesic stands) and improved C sequestration in large trees (over hygric stands). Consideration of ecological site classification in addition to stand age information improved total ecosystem C stock estimates over the use of stand age alone.																			0045-5067	1208-6037				MAY	2009	39	5					897	907		10.1139/X09-018	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/X09-018													WOS:000267810800002

Deep structure of the Vostok Basin, East Antarctica as deduced from seismological observations	GEOTECTONICS												Seismological observations using the earthquake converted-wave method were carried out from December 7, 2002 to January 23, 2003 (season 48 of the Russian Antarctic Expedition) in the southern part of Vostok Subglacial Lake for the purpose of studying the structure of the Earth's crust. Three observation points were placed. One of them was located at the Vostok Station and the other two were located at distances of 8.7 and 12.02 km to the east and to the west of the station, respectively. The performed investigation showed that the thickness of the Earth's crust in the studied area is 34-36 km. The crust is subdivided into three blocks of different ranks. The low-velocity block is situated immediately beneath the Vostok Basin. Seven interfaces of mode conversion were detected. The results obtained allow us to suggest an increase in heat flow in the Vostok Basin and to the east of this basin. The seismic layering of the ice cover is correlated with the results of radioecho sounding and the structure of the glacier documented in cores of 5G-1 Borehole. The interfaces within the glacier near the Vostok Station are located at depths of 700 +/- 100 m, 1600 +/- 100 m, and 2200 +/- 100 m.

KELLEY (4120-Department of Biological Sciences, Behavior, Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics Section, Illinois State University, Normal, Illinois 61790-4120). High white tailed deer density has negative impact on tallgrass prairie forbs. J. Torrey Bot. Soc. 128:381-392, 2001.-We studied the effect of deer browsing on prairie forbs under conditions of high deer density (30 to 42 deer km(2)) on a single remnant tallgrass prairie in the Illinois Department of Natural Resources' Heidecke Lake Fish and Wildlife Area in northeastern Illinois. Almost no grasses or sedges were browsed and the frequency of browsing of graminoids was nearly the same in deer exclosure and reference plots. In contrast, deer browsed 3.5% to 18.9%, of the standing crop of forb stems depending upon time of sampling. Deer selectively browsed 2690 percent of the 100 species of (orbs sampled in at least one of nine samples taken over three growing seasons. However, most species ( 17 of 26 selected species) were selected in only one sample. Highest browsing intensity occurred during late June and early July. Flowering sterns of 3 species of forbs were significantly less abundant in the reference plots than in the exclosure plots. indicating a potentially adverse effect of deer browsing on the reproductive success of these prairie forbs. Deer are most likely to influence prairie vegetation by causing a shift in plant species abundance and competitive abilities in a way that favors grasses over forbs and reduces prairie plant diversity.																			1095-5674	1940-0616				OCT-DEC	2001	128	4					381	392		10.2307/3088670	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3088670													WOS:000173284100006
J	Chuine, I; Aitken, SN; Ying, CC				Chuine, I; Aitken, SN; Ying, CC			Temperature thresholds of shoot elongation in provenances of Pinus contorta	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH												Periodicity of shoot elongation in seedlings of Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. was assessed during one growing season in two extremely different environments (Cowichan Lake, and Red Rock, British Columbia) for 109 provenances sampled range wide. Analysis of variance of total elongation and growth parameters showed significant differences among geographic regions and among provenances within each region. Our study also revealed tremendous genotype-by-environment interaction for growth and phenological traits. The response of growth to temperature of each provenance was assessed from their growth curve using an original methodology. The estimated temperature threshold of the provenance growth responses (i.e., the temperature for which the response reaches half of its maximum) varied between 4.1 and 6.5 degreesC among regions. Threshold temperatures showed less variation than total elongation, and only the northern provenances showed thresholds significantly different from the other regions. Our results show that, across highly contrasting environments, relationship between phenology and growth may not be as important as the relationship between growth and number of internode priomordia. This tempers the results of studies, carried out in one or few similar environments, that have shown that phenological differences were important in determining total height growth in lodgepole pine.																			0045-5067	1208-6037				AUG	2001	31	8					1444	1455		10.1139/cjfr-31-8-1444	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfr-31-8-1444													WOS:000170813900015

Heliozoa were the main protozoan component in the very low pH (< 2.9) lakes. In the lakes with pH > 2.9, the ciliate community consisted of Hypotrichida, Prostomatida and Peritrichida. The species diversity of the ciliate community was reduced and typical representatives of plankton ciliates were lacking. During periods when populations were at their peak, the cell numbers and biomass of ciliates were comparable to those neutral lakes, reaching maximum values of 30 000 cells l(-1) and 0.3 mg l(-1). Cell numbers and biomass peaks appeared without a clear seasonal pattern but in some cases a correlation to phytoplankton dynamics was recognizable.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				AUG	2000	433	1-3					157	166		10.1023/A:1004095426532	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1004095426532													WOS:000089613800016

Development of the pan-arctic snowfall reconstruction:: new land-based solid precipitation estimates for 1940-99	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY												A new product, the Pan-Arctic Snowfall Reconstruction (PASR), is developed to address the problem of cold season precipitation gauge biases for the 1940-99 period. The method used to create the PASR is different from methods used in other large-scale precipitation data products and has not previously been employed for estimating pan-arctic snowfall. The NASA Interannual-to-Seasonal Prediction Project Catchment Land Surface Model is used to reconstruct solid precipitation from observed snow depth and surface air temperatures. The method is tested at four stations in the United States and Canada where results are examined in depth. Reconstructed snowfall at Dease Lake, British Columbia, and Barrow, Alaska, is higher than gauge observations. Reconstructed snowfall at Regina, Saskatchewan, and Minot, North Dakota, is lower than gauge observations, probably because snow is transported by wind out of the Prairie region and enters the hydrometeorological cycle elsewhere. These results are similar to gauge biases estimated by a water budget approach. Reconstructed snowfall is consistently higher than snowfall from the 40-yr European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA- 40) but does not have a consistent relationship with snowfall derived from the WMO Solid Precipitation Intercomparison Project correction algorithms. Advantages of the PASR approach include that 1) the assimilation of snow depth observations captures blowing snow where it is deposited and 2) the modeling approach takes into account physical snowpack evolution. These advantages suggest that the PASR product could be a valuable alternative to statistical gauge corrections and that arctic ground-based solid precipitation observing networks might emphasize snow depth measurements over gauges.

Evidence of stenotopy and anthropogenic influence on carbon source for two major riverine fishes of the Lake Victoria watershed	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Stable isotope analysis was used to investigate the migratory status and to determine the relative contribution of allochthonous and autochthonous sources of carbon for the major riverine fish species (Barbus altianalis and Labeo victorianus) in rivers draining the Kenyan side of Lake Victoria. The two fish species derived carbon from both C4 and C3 plant sources, although L. victorianus exhibited less enriched isotopic carbon values. Fish samples from stations under direct influence of effluents from sugar factories exhibited enriched delta C-13 signals. Assuming that this reflects carbon sourcing from riparian C4 plants, it suggests that carbon from terrestrial sources can be a major energy source in some rivers. This heavy carbon enrichment associated with sugar factories was spatially restricted and occurred in all seasons, implying that sub-populations of the two fish species are non-migratory. The large migratory populations of these two species, for which Lake Victoria was once famous, may be no more.																			0022-1112	1095-8649				MAY	2007	70	5					1430	1446		10.1111/j.1095-8649.2007.01421.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8649.2007.01421.x													WOS:000245813000008

Phosphorus additions generally reduced APA, while other treatments increased activity. Samples receiving nitrogen (N) and P increased APA after a long lag period. P-addition bioassays of Lake Superior were consistent with phytoplankton P limitation and variations in APA indicated potential seasonal and spatial changes in P deficiency status. The results suggest that APA reliably reflected the phytoplankton P status, but may not provide sufficient information when N or NP limitation is present.																			0018-8158						1998	361						145	156																WOS:000073655800013

Geochemical parameters such as aluminum, iron, manganese, phosphorus, nitrogen, and carbon were used to document watershed inputs while redox sensitive elements provided information on changes in hypolimnetic oxygen levels. Changes in the diatom community were used to assess the impacts of development upon the lakes' trophic status as well as changes in the littoral community. We assessed the relative sensitivity of high vs. low ANC lakes. The initial shoreland development, late in the 19(th) or early in the 20(th) century, involved seasonal cabins and minimal disturbance of the shoreland. This development phase had minimal impact upon the lakes compared to that during the mid- and late-twentieth century. Increased levels of iron and aluminum indicated the highest input of sediment occurred during the construction phase of converting shoreland homes from seasonal to year-round usage. Phosphorus deposition increased moderately in the high alkalinity lakes but more so in the low alkalinity lakes. In the low alkalinity stratified lake, increased levels of iron and manganese in the last decade indicated more anoxia in the hypolimnion. Phosphorus levels have also increased during this time period most likely as a result of elevated phosphorus release from the sediments. In the high alkalinity lakes, as the nutrient levels increased, diatom production initially shifted from benthic taxa of the family Fragilariaceae to metalimnetic taxa and as nutrients increased further, epilimnetic species. In the low alkalinity lakes, prior to settlement the major site of diatom prodution was the open water. Coincidental with the early shoreland development was an increase of macrophyte density as indicated by the epiphytic diatom Achnanthidium minutissimum ((Kutzing) Czarnecki (= Achnanthes minutissima Kutzing). The water quality in the high alkalinity lakes showed some improvement following completion of the home construction phase, especially in the lake with lower development density. The low alkalinity lakes did not show improved water quality and appear more sensitive to shoreland development.																			0921-2728					NOV	2000	24	4					369	393		10.1023/A:1008107706726	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1008107706726													WOS:000165089600001

In turn, increases in algal quality positively affect zooplankton growth and reproductive rates. However, these studies have concentrated on explaining variation among lakes over relatively short time periods and have not evaluated the temporal dynamics in the physical-chemical forcing on zooplankton production. We investigated whether there were seasonal changes in the relationship between Daphnia fecundity and the physical-chemical environment, algal community characteristics, and Daphnia length using dynamic linear models (DLM) to analyze a high-resolution, 16-yr time series from Lake Washington. We used two metrics to describe algal quality: the percentage of blue-green algae and the light to total phosphorus (TP) ratio as an indirect metric for algal C: P. Chlorophyll a (Chi a) concentration and algal biovolume served as measures of algal quantity. As expected, both the light:TP ratio and the percentage of blue-green algae had negative effects on Daphnia fecundity, and Chi a concentration and biovolume had positive effects on fecundity. However, we found a comparatively stronger effect of Daphnia length on fecundity, although it was negative and therefore opposite to expectation. In all cases, we observed strong seasonal differences in environmental effects, but no temporal change in the fundamental relationships between our indices of algal quantity and quality, allometry, and Daphnia reproduction. Our results support a hypothesis of physical-chemical coupling to algal quality and zooplankton production but highlight the importance of temporal variation in this forcing.

The role of recreational home ownership in these communities is not well under-stood. We examine the attitudes toward land use controls and local economic development among seasonal and permanent residents. We compare growth machine and local dependency theory explanations for support of land use controls and growth activities. Based on focus groups and survey data collected from seasonal and permanent residents of a northern Wisconsin county, we find that full-time (permanent) residents are much more supportive of local economic development activities and less likely to favor land use planning than are seasonal residents. Socioeconomic differences between seasonal and permanent residents do not explain away the variation between the two groups in these attitudes. Among seasonal residents, support for land use controls declines as they spend more time at their lake homes. The results tend to support Cox and Mair's local dependency thesis.

To mitigate its emission, the bioconversion within landfill cover soils (LCSs) was introduced. H2S emission and concentration both in the field air above the landfill and in microcosm testing were surveyed. Results indicated that H2S emission and concentration in the landfill varied with landfill seasons and sites. There existed relationship between H2S concentration and fluxes spatially and temporally. To characterize and assess the spatial and temporal diversity of sulphur-oxidizing bacteria (SOB) and sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) in the LCSs, the terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique was employed. Using the functional genes of dsrB and soxB, SOB, including Halothiobacillus, Rhodothalassium, Paracocccus, Allochromatium, and Thiobacillus, and SRB, including Desulfovibrio, Syntrophobacter, Desulfomonile and Desulfobacca, were identical and exhibited the dominant role in the LCSs. By employing an alternative available corona reactor, more than 90% removal efficiencies of sulphides were demonstrated, suggesting that the LCSs for eliminating odours in a lower concentration would be feasible.

Herbicidal control of water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) and its impact on aquatic environment	INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY												A research programme was taken up to study the impact of herbicides on the control of water hyacinth [Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms-laubach], optimize dose and time of application, and to trace the impact on aquatic environment through a series of greenhouse and pond studies. The study was undertaken at Veeranum Lake which has a command area of 18,000 ha connected through 27 distributary channels, and infested heavily with water hyacinth. Among the different herbicides tried, viz. glyphosate, 2,4-D Na salt and paraquat, glyphosate proved more efficient with higher magnitude of plant height reduction, weed mortality and reduction in biomass compared with 2,4-D and paraquat. The optimum dose of glyphosate, 2,4-D Na salt and paraquat was 2.5 kg/ha, 1.5 kg/ha and 1.5 kg/ha respectively. Different seasons did not influence the efficacy of herbicides. Glyphosate caused least fish mortality of 23.3% after 32 days. Different organs like gills, brain, liver and kidney of the fishes were studied, for histology and the observations showed tissue distractions in herbicides-treated fish. Glyphosate also proved more efficient and safe on water quality in terms of pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, chemical oxygen demand and mineral content of treated water. The glyphosate-treated water was found safe for irrigating crops with 87, 58 and 62% germination of rice, cotton and okra respectively.						, deivasigamani/0000-0003-4178-9274													0537-197X	0974-4460				DEC	2015	60	4					606	609																WOS:000211675400020

We examined variations in the abundance and feeding of A. osteomystax in two environments, one natural (Sinha Mariana floodplain lake) and one dammed (Manso Reservoir), during two periods: the first year after the filling phase and three years later. Our goal was to evaluate the occupation of the new habitat (Manso Reservoir), by this species, as well as to test the hypothesis that in the reservoir, unlike the natural environment, there are remarkable changes in diet between the periods. Fish were sampled monthly in the floodplain lake and in the reservoir during two annual periods using gillnets. To evaluate the differences in abundance of A. osteomystax we employed the Kruskal -Wallis test, and the diet analysis was carried out using frequency of occurrence and volumetric methods. Temporal differences in the diet were tested by Kruskal-Wallis test using the scores from a detrended correspondence analysis. A. osteomystax was significantly more abundant in the floodplain lake, where the captures were higher than in the reservoir in almost all months analyzed, and significant variations in abundance between the two periods were not recorded in either the reservoir or the floodplain lake. The diet variation between the two periods, which had a time lag of three years between them, was much less pronounced in the natural environment, where the resource availability is essentially regulated by seasonality. Thus, our hypothesis was accepted; that is, the interannual variations in the diet of A. osteomystax are more relevant in an artificial environment than in a natural one.

Gizzard shad population dynamics in eutrophic Missouri reservoirs with emphasis on environmental influences on their growth	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) is an ecologically important species in many waters of the USA. Their versatile feeding and nutrient-recycling capabilities and importance as prey, combined with their commonly high biomasses, result in widespread ecosystem effects. Despite their importance, few studies have focused on variables that influence their population dynamics, especially in mid-latitude waters. The objectives of this study were to: (1) describe population dynamics including size and age structure, growth, and mortality and (2) determine potential environmental influences on annual variations in growth increments of gizzard shad. Gizzard shad populations were sampled annually in three eutrophic reservoirs in Missouri, over a successive 5-year period. Size and age structure were temporally variable owing to variable year-class strength and differing growth rates. Strong year-classes arose from age-0 cohorts that experienced relatively high overwinter survival. Annual variations in growth increments across all cohorts and reservoirs appeared to be affected by the initial length of fish at the beginning of the growing season and by food availability. Annual mortality estimates ranged from 0.38 to 0.70 for ages 3-7 among the reservoirs. Due to their dynamic nature, effects of these populations on their ecosystems also must be temporally variable and complex. Future studies should focus on the importance of these temporal effects on ecosystem dynamics.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				JUN	2012	27	2					185	197		10.1080/02705060.2011.650898	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2011.650898													WOS:000304454400003

The impairment of the cortisol stress response was observed in fish 4+ years and older whereas the capacity to elevate plasma cortisol levels of fish younger than 4+ was not significantly different at contaminated and reference sites. The responsiveness to ACTH of the interrenal tissue of 4+ yellow perch was evalutated in vitro to determine whether the impairment of the cortisol stress response is caused by a dysfunction of the interrenal tissue or if the dysfunction is located elsewhere in the hypothalamo-pituitary-interrenal axis controlling the secretion of cortisol. The amount of cortisol secreted by the interrenal tissue of yellow perch from a contaminated site in response to a 10-min stimulation with 10(-7) M ACTH was significantly lower compared with fish from the reference site. These results indicate that the impairment of the cortisol stress response observed in fish from polluted sites is caused, at least in part, by a dysfunction of the interrenal tissue.

J	McNeish, RE; Benbow, ME; McEwan, RW				McNeish, Rachel Elizabeth; Benbow, Mark Eric; McEwan, Ryan Walker			Riparian invasion of Lonicera maackii influences throughfall chemistry and rainwater availability	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH												Riparian forests are a functionally important interface between terrestrial and aquatic communities, facilitating the transfer of subsidies that support aquatic biota and ecosystem processes. Invasion of the non-native shrub Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii) in forests of the Midwestern United States has resulted in the formation of a dense monospecific shrub-layer along many headwater streams, substantially altering both the composition and structure of riparian plant communities. We investigated the effects of L. maackii on the chemistry of throughfall (rain that has passed through a plant canopy) in a riparian forest. During the growing season of 2015, throughfall collections were made in areas with no plant canopy (Open), a native forest canopy (Upper canopy), and within the forest but immediately under L. maackii shrubs (Honeysuckle). The Honeysuckle treatment intercepted 28-64% more throughfall compared to the Upper canopy treatment, resulting in lowered throughfall volume under the shrubs. The Honeysuckle treatment had substantially greater total carbon and total organic carbon concentration in throughfall compared to other throughfall treatments (P<0.01). Total nitrogen and dissolved nitrogen deposition was up to 66% reduced under Honeysuckle treatments compared to a 45% reduction from Upper Canopy collections. In summary, these findings contribute to the growing scientific literature demonstrating that invasion by the exotic shrub L. maackii can capture incoming rainwater and alter the chemistry of throughfall, impacting cross-system nutrient subsidies and riparian function.					; Benbow, Mark/V-5895-2019	McNeish, Rachel/0000-0002-8671-1692; McEwan, Ryan/0000-0002-1594-9679													0912-3814	1440-1703				SEP	2018	33	5					1021	1030		10.1007/s11284-018-1620-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11284-018-1620-2													WOS:000443688900021
J	Pietruszynski, L; Cieslinski, R				Pietruszynski, Lukasz; Cieslinski, Roman			The effects of different land use and hydrological types on water chemistry of young glacial ponds	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The study aims to examine the effect of ponds on changes in water quality in a young glacial river catchment. The goal was to identify situations where a periodic hydrographic network is formed in outflow-free areas, which is connected with a higher order receiving area, as well as to study the circulation of matter in this type of system. This study answers the following key question: Do ponds affected by areal pollution substantially affect water quality in streams in periods where they become joined with the hydrographic network? The purpose of the research was to identify patterns associated with the functioning of ponds in young glacial areas in northern Poland on the example of the Borucinka catchment. Ponds were selected in order to generate a study sample characterized by different types of land use, local hydrology, and pond surface area. The study focused on the effects of catchment land use on pond water quality and the effects of periodic changes in local hydrology (linkage of surface flows with bodies of water) on pond water quality. Research has shown that land use in a pond catchment yields a substantial effect on pond water quality. The basic reason for the higher concentration of selected ions is close proximity to farms that generate wastewater, which reaches bodies of water in the study area. Seasonal changes in the concentration of biogenic substances were not observed in ponds. Only notable changes in the concentration of total nitrogen were observed due the episodic formation of a hydrographic network consisting of a collection of linked depressions. One of the more surprising findings was that permanently isolated ponds, which theoretically collect catchment pollutants all the time, are characterized by good hydrochemical conditions.					; Cieslinski, Roman/A-5427-2008	Cieslinski, Roman/0000-0002-5313-1923; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				SEP	2018	564						605	618		10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.07.049	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.07.049													WOS:000445316200048

The present paper includes the first records and descriptions of conchostracans (Euestheria martinsnetoi sp. nov.) and actinopterygian fish remains in Triassic sediments of the Rio Mendoza Formation. All previously known Triassic conchostracans of the Cuyo Basin come from the Cerro de las Cabras, Potrerillos and Cacheuta Formations, or their equivalents. Similarly, fish remains were only known from the Potrerillos, Cacheuta and Santa Clara Abajo Formations. The fossils, also including plant remains, were found in red massive clays in the middle section of the type sequence of the Rio Mendoza Formation, above the initial facies of alluvial fans on the northern slope of cerro Bayo (Potrerillos area, northwestern of Mendoza province). This fauna and flora developed in semipermanent extense water bodies, localized small lakes and/or ponds produced by the overflowing of channels or mudflows in a strongly seasonal fluvial environment in the lowermost parts of the system. The continental red sediments of the basal unit of the Uspallata Group are nowadays considered to be late Middle Triassic in age (equivalent to the "Ladinian" stage of the marine sequences), instead of Early Triassic as was previously thought. According to recent reinterpretations, the stages following the Choiyoi volcanic cycle, which underlies the Rio Mendoza Formation discordantly, would reach to the early Middle Triassic in the Cuyo Basin. Thus, these are the oldest conchostracan and fish records in the Triassic of Argentina.

The studied populations were collected from seven alkaline lakes of the Brazilian Pantanal and Nabor Carrillo Lake, Texcoco region (Mexico), between 2004 and 2012, where they frequently formed blooms during the dry season. The morphological plasticity of the populations, from natural and culture conditions, was described based on 200 individuals of each species. The 16S rRNA and the cpc-BA-IGS phylogenetic analyses show Anabaenopsis as a sister-taxon of Cyanospira. The Anabaenopsis Glade has three strongly supported subclusters related to the origin of strains: Pantanal+Mexico, Kenya+Australia and one European Glade. Although these data indicate that the currently known Anabaenopsis strains belong to more than one species, we are being conservative and not describing them as new species due to the lack of more molecular data. We highlight the need of a revision of the genus, considering also that Anabaenopsis sp. PCC 9215, the current reference strain used for the genus, is not identified as A. elenkinii and it is phylogenetically grouped with Anabaenopsis strains identified as A. circular's, A. arnoldii, A. nadsonii and A. elenkinii.					; Fiore, Marli/C-1436-2012; Ballot, Andreas/G-7752-2019; Andreote, Ana/A-8457-2015; Santos, Kleber Renan de Souza/C-6523-2012; Anna, Célia/D-3735-2015; Laughinghouse, Haywood/M-5836-2016; Andreote, Ana Paula Dini/A-8457-2015; Novelo, Eberto/JSK-9966-2023; Fiore, Marli F./C-1436-2012; de Souza Santos, Kleber Renan/JAN-4828-2023	Scotta Hentschke, Guilherme/0000-0003-4396-024X; Ballot, Andreas/0000-0002-4088-0677; Santos, Kleber Renan de Souza/0000-0002-1513-893X; Laughinghouse, Haywood/0000-0003-1018-6948; Andreote, Ana Paula Dini/0000-0003-0725-2705; Fiore, Marli F./0000-0003-2555-7967; 													1179-3155	1179-3163				AUG 30	2018	367	1					1	12		10.11646/phytotaxa.367.1.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.11646/phytotaxa.367.1.1													WOS:000443169800001

The phytoplankton taxa recorded included the Cyanobacteria, Dinomastigota, Chrysophyceae, Bacillariophyceae, Chlorophyceae, Cryptophyceae and Haptophyceae, but infection was never found in the last two classes. The parasites belonged almost exclusively to the monocentric Chytridiomycetes. Fungal epidemics occurred at all times of the year. Parasites appeared at population densities as low as about 1 cell ml(-1) in some host species, with infection prevalence sometimes exceeding 80%. The proportion of the total phytoplankton biovolume infected by fungi was usually much <1%, but occasionally reached 10%. Parasitism proved to be highly species-specific, with one parasite species usually infecting only one host species. In the case of Zygorhizidium planktonicum, which infected both Asterionella formosa and Synedra acus, there is evidence that two species-specific formae speciales, each infecting only one of these two host species, are present in the lake.																			0028-646X					MAR	1998	138	3					507	517		10.1046/j.1469-8137.1998.00126.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1469-8137.1998.00126.x													WOS:000073032500013

There was a negative co-variaton between the open field THg inputs and the ratio of THg output to open field input. The highest ratio (and lowest input) occurring in N. Sweden and S. Finland, while the lowest output ratio (and highest inputs) occurred in southwest Sweden. A much larger variation was found in the ratio of output to open field input for MeHg (14 to 160%). Examinations of MeHg input/output data in relation to catchment charateristics suggest that riparian peat, mires and wet organic soil contributed to the large MeHg output from certain catchments, probably due to in situ production of MeHg. This finding is consistent with other studies which have found that catchment characteristics such as wetland area, flow pathways, seasonal temperature and water flow are important in controlling the output of MeHg. These catchment characteristics govern the fate of the contemporary input of Hg and MeHg as well as the mobilization of the soil pools.

In this article, the unsaturated soil mechanics combined with a numerical method is applied to build the rainfall thresholds for the Xiangmi Lake slope in early warning. The drainage mechanism in soil slope under different rainfall conditions has been studied. Then, the actual rainfall data collected in the rainy season are taken as the rainfall condition to simulate the actual rainfall situation. The corresponding safety factor of the slope under the rainfall has been calculated and compared with the improved deformation tangential angle criterion for the slope safety prediction. The tangent angle can be used as the judgment basis to classify the early warning levels of a rainstorm, which helps to establish the early warning model of slope rainfall and guide the landslide early warning.					leng, xp/KBR-3758-2024; ou, ou/JLN-0921-2023	leng, xiaopeng/0000-0001-5062-6114													2391-5447					DEC 14	2022	14	1					1434	1443		10.1515/geo-2022-0417	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/geo-2022-0417													WOS:000898991100001
J	Radtke, G				Radtke, Grzegorz			Effects of substrate composition and water temperature on the emergence success of lacustrine brown trout Salmo trutta m. lacustris L. fry from natural redds	FOLIA ZOOLOGICA												The emergence of lake-migratory brown trout Salmo trutta m. lacustris L. fry from natural redds was observed in a small lake outlet stream. A total of 1104 emerging fry were captured in traps in nine of the 12 investigated redds during three seasons. In 2005, all the fry emerged during the daytime, but in 2007 and 2009 they emerged mostly at night. Furthermore, the timing of emergence was earlier than expected from temperature models. The fry left the redds at a water temperature range of 6.2-15.0 degrees C, and the emergence pattern was correlated with the moon phase. The number of fry captured was strongly affected by the percentage of fine particles < 1 mm and the 8-16 mm particle content, and was positively correlated with the geometric mean of substrate particle size (D-g) and the index of permeability: the fredle index (f(i)). The estimated survival rate between egg deposition and fry emergence ranged from 0.0 to 59.8 % in individual redds. Additionally, the greatest number of fry and the highest survival rate were observed in redds that had the high water velocity and shortest duration of intragravel period.

Hunter-gatherers in labyrinth karst: An Early Holocene record from Gunung Sewu, Java	ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN ASIA												Gua Mandung is an inland prehistoric site in Gunung Sewu karst area of central Java, Indonesia. This area is rich in valleys and corridors which make up Gunung Sewu's distinct labyrinth-like landscape. For Java, Gunung Sewu is known to have a relatively harsh environment with limited access to permanent water sources and a short wet season. However, here we report evidence of occupation at the site of Gua Mandung since at least 11,073 cal BP. An abundance of terrestrial fauna remains alongside numerous bone tools with differing functionalities suggests that these early cave dwellers applied well-developed subsistence strategies to maximise the available resources. Gua Mandung records continuous exploitation of small to large terrestrial fauna including monkeys, porcupine, deer, pig, cattle, rat, snake, and monitor lizard. The site's proximity to nearby lakes and a -5 km walk to the coast also provided Gua Mandung's early inhabitants with secondary aquatic resources such as fish, freshwater shells, marine shells, barnacles, crab, and sea urchin. Based on our findings from the Gua Mandung excavation, and in comparison with surrounding archaeological sites, coastal resource exploitation appears to have been a common, albeit more minor, subsistence strategy employed by the early inland communities of the Gunung Sewu karst area.

J	Baerenklau, KA; Provencher, B				Baerenklau, KA; Provencher, B			Static modeling of dynamic recreation behavior: Implications for prediction and welfare estimation	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT												This paper examines the consequences of using a static model of recreation trip-taking behavior when the underlying decision problem is dynamic. Specifically we examine the implications for trip forecasting and welfare estimation using a panel dataset of Lake Michigan salmon anglers for the 1996 and 1997 fishing seasons. We derive and estimate both a structural dynamic model using Bellman's equation, and a reduced-form static model with trip probability expressions mimicking those of the dynamic model. We illustrate an inherent identification problem in the reduced-form model that creates biased welfare estimates, and we discuss the general implications of this for the interpretation of preference parameters in static models. We then use both models to simulate trip taking behavior and show that although their in-sample trip forecasts are similar, their welfare estimates and out-of-sample forecasts are quite different.

Five larval helminth parasites were recovered including the nematode, Contracaecum sp., the acanthocephalan Polyacanthorhynchus kenyensis, the digenetic trematode, Clinostomum sp. and two cestodes, Amirthalingamia sp. and Cyclustera sp. Both prevalence and intensity of the infection of these helminths increased in larger sized fish, whereas male fish were more heavily infected than females. No seasonality in infection level were observed. The health status of both fish species remained unaffected, although O. leucostictus from Oloidien Bay which harboured heavy infections of Contracaecum exhibited stuntedness and the lack of fatty deposits around the digestive caecum.																			0022-149X	1475-2697				JUN	2002	76	2					95	102		10.1079/JOH2001105	http://dx.doi.org/10.1079/JOH2001105								12015820					WOS:000175619500001
J	Blanchfield, PJ; Ridgway, MS				Blanchfield, PJ; Ridgway, MS			Reproductive timing and use of redd sites by lake-spawning brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												We provide a detailed description of a salmonine mating system based on daily observations of tagged individuals in a lake-spawning population of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) throughout two breeding seasons. Actual spawning occurred over a period of similar to 50 d. Over 90% of spawning males were present soon after spawning commenced and outnumbered females for the duration of the spawning period. The amount of time males and females remained on the spawning grounds increased with body size; however, males were present over a longer period than females of equivalent size. A distinct seasonal peak in spawning activity (similar to 15 d) accounted for 58 and 84% (1994 and 1995) of all reproduction and was coincident with a decline in water temperature below 11 degrees C and increased rainfall. Selection of redd sites by female brook trout was determined by groundwater flow which was significantly greater than at nonspawning sites. A preference for certain redd sites was observed, with 50% of spawnings occurring at 11 sites. The construction of multiple redds and duration in spawning activity by females increased with body size. Extensive reuse of redd sites and rapid replacement of females during removal experiments indicate that redd sites are a limiting resource.

J	Tang, HJ; Xie, P				Tang, HJ; Xie, P			Budgets and dynamics of nitrogen and phosphorus in a shallow, hypereutrophic lake in China	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Budgets and dynamics of nitrogen and phosphorus in Lake Donghu were investigated from Oct. 1997 to Sept. 1999. The water residence time was estimated to be 89 days in 1997-1998 and 124 days in 1998-1999. The total external loadings were 53 g N m(-2) yr(-1) and 3.2 g P m(-2) yr(-1) in 1997-1998, and 42 g N m(-2) yr(-1) and 3.1 g P m(-2) yr(-1) in 1998-1999. On average, about 80% of nitrogen and phosphorus input was from sewage outlets, while the rest was from land runoff and precipitation. Ammonium ion was the most abundant form of inorganic nitrogen in the sewage. The nutrient output was mainly through water outflow and fish catch. The percentages of nutrients in fish were estimated to be 7.8%-11.2% for nitrogen and 47.6%- 49.6% for phosphorus. Lake Donghu has a very high nutrient retention (63% for nitrogen and 79% for phosphorus) mainly due to its closure and long water residence time. Sedimentation is an important nutrient retention mechanism in this lake. Using mass balance method, we estimated that denitrification of Lake Donghu involves about 50% of the retained nitrogen. Lake Donghu is rich in inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus and showed great seasonal variation.

J	FORTIN, D; LEPPARD, GG; TESSIER, A				FORTIN, D; LEPPARD, GG; TESSIER, A			CHARACTERISTICS OF LACUSTRINE DIAGENETIC IRON OXYHYDROXIDES	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Diagenetic iron oxyhydroxides formed by the oxidation of iron(II) were allowed to deposit onto inert collectors vertically inserted into the sediments of eight lakes chosen to represent a range of lake pH values. Particles comprising the iron-rich deposits have been characterized at macroscopic (composition; X-ray diffraction) and microscopic (transmission electron microscopy; energy dispersive spectroscopy; electron diffraction) levels. The only crystalline forms of Fe(III) oxyhydroxides identified were poorly ordered ferrihydrite and lepidocrocite. Morphologies of lepidocrocite (lath-type) and presumably of ferrihydrite (spherical and ellipsoidal particles) are similar to those reported previously as being formed in the water column of seasonally anoxic lakes. Deposition of iron oxyhydroxides in the lake sediments also appears to occur on bacterial cells and on their exopolymers. Silicon, sulfate. chloride, phosphate, manganese, calcium, and aluminum represented minor components of the diagenetic Fe(III) oxyhydroxides, whereas organic carbon was a more abundant component. Calculations with a diffuse layer version of the surface complexation model using the ambient dissolved concentrations, and comparison of the predicted and measured compositions of the iron-rich particles suggest that sulfate, phosphate, and probably calcium were sorbed on the iron oxyhydroxides, whereas silicon was probably more firmly bound at the surface.																			0016-7037	1872-9533				SEP	1993	57	18					4391	4404		10.1016/0016-7037(93)90490-N	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(93)90490-N													WOS:A1993MC19200004

Core samples were taken monthly from eight points in each site from March to August 1999. Levante was more eutrophic, less saline, and held more and larger chironomid larvae than Murtulas. Larvae of six taxa were identified at Levante and five at Murtulas. Chironomus aprilinus and C. salinarius morphotypes dominated at Levante, whereas Tanytarsus spp. and C. salinarius dominated at Murtulas. In generalized linear models, there were significant effects of site, month, and site X month interactions on larval size at both family and taxon levels. On average, C. salinarius larvae were larger at MUR, probably due to a lower proportion of smaller instars and lower growth rates. Although the overall trend was for a reduction in mean larval size over time in both wetlands, mean size peaked in March at Levante and in May at Murtulas.

Gas bubbles were collected in floating traps deployed during 12- to 60-hour observation periods. Comparison of floating traps and floating chambers showed that about 98% of methane emission occurred by bubbling and only 2% occurred by diffusion. Average methane concentration of bubbles at our sites varied from 67% to 77%. Methane emission by bubbling occurred episodically, with greatest rates primarily between the hours of 0800 and 1400 LT. Events appear to be triggered by wind. The flux of methane associated with bubbling was strongly anticorrelated with water depth. Seasonal changes in water depth caused seasonal variation of methane emission. Bubble methane fluxes through the lake surface into the atmosphere measured during 24-hour intervals were least (10-200 mg m-2 d-1) at deeper sites (>7 m) and greatest (300-2000 mg m-2 d-1) at shallow sites (<2 m).

Agricultural runoff and poorly treated wastewater have entered this reservoir at alarming rates during past rainy seasons, causing the cultural eutrophication of this body of water and resulting in several massive fish kill events. In this study, shotgun metagenomic sequencing was used to examine the taxonomic and functional structure of microbial communities in Lake Cajititlan during the rainy season. Several water quality features and their interactions with microbial communities were also assessed to identify the major factors affecting the water quality and biota, specifically fish species. According to current water quality regulations, most of the physicochemical variables analyzed (dissolved oxygen, pH, Secchi disk, NH4+, NO3-, blue-green algae, total phosphorus, and chlorophyll-a) were outside of the permissible limits. Planktothrix agardhii and Microcystis aeruginosa were the most abundant phytoplankton species, and the dominant bacterial genera were Pseudomonas, Streptomyces, and Flavobacterium, with Pseudomonas fluorescens, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Aeromonas veronii representing the most abundant bacterial species. All of these microorganisms have been reported to be potentially harmful to fish, and the latter three (P. fluorescens, S. maltophilia, A. veronii) also contain genes associated with pathogenicity in fish mortality (fur, luxS, aer, act, aha, exu, lip, ser). Genetic evidence from the microbial communities analyzed herein reveals that anthropogenic sources of nutrients in the lake altered genes involved in nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and carbon metabolism, mainly at the beginning of the rainy season. These findings suggest that abiotic factors influence the structure of the microbial communities, along with the major biogeochemical cycles of Lake Cajititlan, resulting in temporal variations and an excess of microorganisms that can thrive in high-nutrient and low-oxygen environments. After reviewing the literature, this appears to be the first study that focuses on characterizing the water quality of a subtropical hypereutrophic lake through associations between physicochemical variables and shotgun metagenomic data. In addition, there are few studies that have coupled the metabolism of aquatic ecosystems with nutrient cycles.					de Anda, José/HTS-2413-2023; Hernández, Misael/ABD-1937-2020; DIAZ TORRES, OSIRIS/ISB-3807-2023; Senés-Guerrero, Carolina/AAT-2254-2021; Lugo, Yadira/AAS-7483-2021	Diaz Torres, Osiris/0000-0002-6211-245X; de Anda, Jose/0000-0001-9521-5968; Orozco-Nunnelly, Danielle Annette/0000-0003-3381-0504; 														1664-302X				DEC 2	2022	13								1037626	10.3389/fmicb.2022.1037626	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2022.1037626								36532453					WOS:000897908900001
J	Saavedra, NE; Rush, SA; Olin, JA; Paterson, G				Saavedra, Nicole E.; Rush, Scott A.; Olin, Jill A.; Paterson, Gordon			Combined tracers reveal the multi-dimensionality of resource partitioning among sympatric forage fish	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Quantifying the multi-dimensional nature of resource partitioning in-situ represents a fundamental challenge for understanding how environmental conditions contribute to the co-existence of sympatric species. For aquatic poikilotherms, the availability of temperatures at or near optima generally define the ranges and limitations of species biology and ecology. Specifically, how poikilotherms partition this abiotic resource remains a broader unknown in aquatic ecology. 2. Alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), deepwater sculpin (Myoxocephalus thompsonii), rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax), and round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) co-occur throughout Lake Ontario and are known to share common prey resources. Here, we used a combination of trophic tracers (stable isotopes), pollutants (polychlorinated biphenyls, PCBs), and bioenergetic modelling to illustrate resource partitioning of diet items and thermal habitat among Lake Ontario prey fish species. We predicted that the combined use of delta C-13, delta N-15, and PCBs will capture the multi-dimensional nature of resource partitioning among coexisting species inhabiting similar compartments within this ecosystem. 3. The delta C-13 and delta N-15 values confirmed our understanding of trophic relationships among these species. A bioenergetic model predicted temperature occupancies for each species and for individuals during the open water growing season when prey consumption rates are likely to be maximised and the PCB congener profiles were highly correlated with these predictions. Three-dimensional niche modelling demonstrated that ecological tracer assimilation is probably a direct result of species behavioural thermoregulation during the open water growing season when temperatures are at or near physiological optima. 4. These results demonstrate that the ability of aquatic poikilotherms to track optimal temperatures and exploit habitat and food resources is captured by their PCB congener profiles. Consumer PCB congener profiles integrate not only the specific prey resources consumed, but also the predominant thermal conditions under which those resources were acquired and assimilated and that subsequently regulate individual and species growth. Given their global ubiquity and capacity for interpretation under the assumptions applied to ecological tracers, consumer PCB profiles could greatly advance our understanding of the mechanisms regulating resource partitioning, especially among aquatic poikilotherms.					; Rush, Scott/AAI-9848-2020	Paterson, Gordon/0000-0001-8453-4197; Rush, Scott/0000-0001-5920-7768													0046-5070	1365-2427				FEB	2023	68	2					288	300		10.1111/fwb.14024	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.14024		DEC 2022											WOS:000916447800001

Fish carcass deposition to suppress invasive lake trout through hypoxia causes limited, non-target effects on benthic invertebrates in Yellowstone Lake	AQUACULTURE, FISH AND FISHERIES												Invasive species can have negative effects on native biodiversity and ecosystem function, and suppression is often required to minimize the effects. However, management actions to suppress invasive species may cause negative, unintended effects on non-target taxa. Across the United States, lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) are invasive in many freshwater ecosystems, reducing native fish abundance and diversity through predation and competition. In an integrated pest management approach, lake trout embryos in Yellowstone Lake, Wyoming, are suppressed by depositing lake trout carcasses onto spawning sites; the carcasses reduce dissolved oxygen concentrations as they decay, causing embryo mortality. We conducted a field experiment during one ice-free season at four sites in Yellowstone Lake to investigate the non-target effects of carcass treatment on benthic invertebrates, which could have consequences for native fish diets. While overall invertebrate density and biomass did not respond to carcass treatment, Chironomidae midges and Sphaeriidae fingernail clams decreased in abundance. Carcass treatment altered invertebrate community structure based on density, but not biomass. Carcass treatment to suppress invasive fish embryos has spatially localized, non-target effects on some benthic invertebrate taxa. Given the small spatial extent of carcass treatment within the lake, we conclude it is unlikely that carcass treatment will alter food availability for native fishes. In Yellowstone Lake, Wyoming, lake trout carcasses are used to suppress invasive lake trout embryos in an effort to conserve native Yellowstone cutthroat trout. Using a field experiment, we determined that carcass treatment had limited, non-target effects on benthic invertebrates.image					Tronstad, Lusha/JXN-4507-2024	Glassic, Hayley/0000-0001-6839-1026; Koel, Todd/0000-0001-6919-5828; Briggs, Michelle/0000-0002-4560-2799													2693-8847					DEC	2022	2	6					470	483		10.1002/aff2.72	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aff2.72													WOS:001125491800002
J	Shilla, DA; Asaeda, T; Kalibbala, M				Shilla, Daniel Abel; Asaeda, Takashi; Kalibbala, Martin			Phosphorus speciation in Myall Lake sediment, NSW, Australia	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												The amount of phosphorus and its fractions in the sediment of Lake Myall, NSW, Australia, was assessed using a sequential extraction technique. Five sedimentary phosphorus reservoirs were measured, namely loosely sorbed phosphorus (NH(4)Cl-P), iron associated phosphorus (BD-P), calcium bound phosphorus (HCl-P), metal oxide bound phosphorus (NaOH-P) and residual phosphorus ( organic and refractory P, Res-P). Samples were taken from the deep and shallow sites of the lake. During the analysis, the average concentrations of each fraction of phosphorus was calculated. The results depicted that the total phosphorus (TP) content and chemically extractable phosphorus in both fine and coarse sediment fractions from the deep sites of the lake were significantly higher than those of the shallow sites, except for HCl-P extracted from the fine sediment fraction. Sediment TP was also strongly and positively correlated to sediment Fe. The phosphorus in the sediment mainly consisted of BD-P and Res-P, while NH(4)Cl-P and HCl-P only contributed a minor part. The rank order of the different phosphorus extracts was similar for the two sites, namely Residual-P > BD-P > NaOH-P > HCl-P > NH(4)Cl-P.

J	Shao, ZJ; Xie, P; Yan, ZG				Shao, ZJ; Xie, P; Yan, ZG			Long-term changes of planktonic rotifers in a subtropical Chinese lake dominated by filter-feeding fishes	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The long-term changes (1956-1998) in density and species composition of planktonic rotifers were studied at two sampling stations (I, II) of Lake Donghu, a shallow eutrophic Chinese Lake densely stocked with filter-feeding fishes. Annual average densities of rotifers increased with an increase in fish yield and eutrophication, whilst species number decreased from 82 in 1962-1963 to 62 in 1994-1998. 2. During 1962-98, some species such as Anuraeopsis fissa, Polyarthra spp. (including P. dolichoptera & P. vulgaris), Trichocerca pusilla and Synchaeta oblonga increased their percentage in abundance remarkably, whilst the proportion of Keratella cochlearis decreased at two relatively eutrophic stations from 19 to 4.2% at Station I and from 30 to 3.2% at Station IL 3. The high r(max) of A. fissa probably made it more successful than other rotifers under high predation pressure by planktivorous fish. The decrease in the K. cochlearis population might be attributed partly to predation by Cyclops vicinus. 4. Small rotifers were less vulnerable to fish predation than large-sized cladocerans. Decreases in cladocerans coincided with increases in rotifers, suggesting that the indirect effect of fish predation on cladocerans might have partly contributed to the population development of rotifers in Lake Donghu during recent decades. 5. We also conducted surveys (1994-1998) of seasonal dynamics of rotifers at four sampling stations (I-IV) which have varied in trophic status after fragmentation of the lake in the 1960s. A total of 75 species were identified at the four stations. Both densities and biomass of rotifers were considerably higher in the two more eutrophic stations than in the two less eutrophic stations. This indicates that the population increase of rotifers at Stations I and II during recent decades might be partly attributed to eutrophication of the lake water.

Buffaloes play a major role in the transmission of Schistosoma japonicum to humans. The aim of the present study was to increase understanding of the epidemic characteristics of schistosomiasis japonica in water buffaloes in the Poyang Lake region, after achieving the national mid-term goal, and to provide a basis for further interventions. The baseline prevalence in two villages in the Poyang Lake region in May 2010 was compared with respect to usage, sex and age in the total study population. Seasonal dynamics from May 2010 to May 2011 were observed in a natural village in the studied area. The baseline prevalence of infection in both villages (Caohui and Gaozhou) was 4.94% in May 2010. The prevalence in buffalo younger than 12 months was 12.82% in Caohui and 15.11% in Gaozhou, which was significantly higher than that found in those aged 13-24 months and older than 24 months. Of the 28 infected buffaloes, 82.14% (23) were younger than 12 months. The flow of seasonal dynamics showed that S. japonicum infection buffaloes were found from May to July and from November to January of the following year. This survey suggested that it is necessary to conduct two mass treatments (especially for young animals) in late March or early April and November, with an additional treatment of positive animals in July or June.

Previous research has shown that increased concentrations of dissolved reactive P (DRP) in runoff from grassland are highly correlated to increased soil test P (STP) levels. We conducted an experiment to investigate the hypothesis that seasonal changes in field conditions (especially soil moisture) along with the practice of air-drying soil samples prior to analysis may affect such correlations. Grass plots with a aide range of STP were randomly divided into two groups. In May (wet season), soil samples were taken from each plot in the first group, simulated rain was applied (75 mm h(-1)) to produce 30 min of runoff, and filtered runoff samples were analyzed for DRP. Each soil sample was analyzed for H2O content, sieved (2 mm), and split into two subsamples. One subsample from each plot was kept field-moist at 4 degrees C, and the other was air dried. Phosphorus saturation was determined only on air-dry soil, but all soil subsamples were analyzed by Mehlich III and distilled H2O methods. In August (dry season), the second group of plots received the same treatment. All correlations of STP to runoff DRP were significant (P < 0.01), regardless of season or STP method. Water-extractable STP from air-dry soil (mean = 28.5 mg kg(-1)) and Mehlich III STP (mean = 145 mg kg(-1)) were not affected by season, but DRP concentration in August runoff (mean = 1.05 mg L-1) was almost double that in May (mean = 0.57 mg L-1), so the resulting correlations were affected. Water-extractable STP from field-moist sod was higher in August (mean = 23 mg kg(-1)) than in May (mean = 16 mg kg(-1)), and P saturation levels showed a similar trend. Runoff volumes were smaller in August, so season had little effect on mean DRP-mass loss.

J	Rothermich, MM; Guerrero, R; Lenz, RW; Goodwin, S				Rothermich, MM; Guerrero, R; Lenz, RW; Goodwin, S			Characterization, seasonal occurrence, and diel fluctuation of poly(hydroxyalkanoate) in photosynthetic microbial mats	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												In situ poly(hydroxyalkanoate) (PHA) levels and repeating-unit compositions were examined in stratified photosynthetic microbial mats from Great Sippewissett Salt Marsh, Mass., and Ebro Delta, Spain. Unlike what has been observed in pure cultures of phototrophic bacteria, the prevalence of hydroxyvalerate (HV) repeating units relative to hydroxybutyrate (HB) repeating units was striking. In the cyanobacteria-dominated green material of Sippewissett mats, the mole percent ratio of repeating units was generally 1HB:1HV. In the purple sulfur bacteria-dominated pink material the relationship was typically 1HB:2HV. In Sippewissett mats, PHA contributed about 0.5 to 1% of the organic carbon in the green layer and up to 6% in the pink layer. In Ebro Delta mats, PHA of approximately 1HB:2HV-repeating-unit distribution contributed about 2% of the organic carbon of the composite photosynthetic layers (the green and pink layers were not separated). Great Sippewissett Salt Marsh mats were utilized for more extensive investigation of seasonal, diel, and exogenous carbon effects. When the total PHA content was normalized to organic carbon, there was little seasonal variation in PHA levels. However, routine daily variation was evident at all sites and seasons. In every case, PHA levels increased during the night and decreased during the day. This phenomenon was conspicuous in the pink layer, where PHA levels doubled overnight. The daytime declines could be inhibited by artificial shading. Addition of exogenous acetate, lactate, and propionate induced two- to fivefold increases in the total PHA levels when applied in the daylight but had no effect when applied at night. The distinct diel pattern of in situ PHA accumulation at night appears to be related, in some phototrophs, to routine dark energy metabolism and is not influenced by the availability of organic nutrients.

J	Patel, AB; Fukami, K; Nishijima, T				Patel, AB; Fukami, K; Nishijima, T			Regulation of seasonal variability of aminopeptidase activities in surface and bottom waters of Uranouchi Inlet, Japan	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												The potential aminopeptidase activity (APA) vis-h-vis important ecological parameters of surface and bottom waters of Uranouchi Inlet (Japan), a semi-enclosed eutrophic coastal ecosystem, were studied on a weekly to biweekly basis from mid-August 1996 to early November 1997. The aim of this study was to investigate the main factors regulating the annual and seasonal dynamics of APA in the inlet. APA was estimated in short-term incubations as the V(max) of the rate of enzymatic hydrolysis of a fluorophore 7-L-leucyl-4-methyl couomarinylamide under conditions close to those of in situ. The water column structure at the study site changed considerably during the study period as the ecological parameters such as temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), nutrient contents, and bacterial abundance exhibited pronounced seasonal stratification (May to September). When the water column was mixed (October to March), surface and bottom waters possessed similar APA. But when the water column became stratified, pronounced differences became apparent, with surface water showing considerably higher APA. On extreme days, surface water possessed as much as similar to 20 times higher APA than that of bottom water. Thus, APA of surface water demonstrated strong seasonality and varied by almost 40-fold compared to that of bottom water, which varied only about 12-fold during the study period. Notably, bacterial abundances of both waters showed limited seasonality and varied only similar to 3-fold during the same period. These results imply that changes in APA are not merely a function of bacterial abundance but rather more of per-cell activity. On an annual basis, APA in both waters were positively correlated (p < 0.001) with temperature and bacterial abundance, and negatively correlated with salinity (p < 0.001 for surface and p < 0.01 for bottom water) but were not correlated (p > 0.05) with DO, chlorophyll a (p < 0.05; only for surface water), inorganic or organic forms of nitrogen (DIN, DON) or inorganic phosphorous (DIP) contents. Furthermore, when the water column was mixed, APA correlated strongly with temperature (p < 0.001; r = 0.87), and marginally (p < 0.05) with DIN (r = 0.43) and DIP (r = 0.40) content but not with DO (p > 0.05) content. In contrast, when the water column became stratified, APA correlated only marginally with temperature (0.01 < p < 0.05; r = 0.33) but strongly with DO (p < 0.001; r = 0.73), and negatively (p < 0.001) with DIN (r = -0.61) and DIP (r = -0.70) content. DON content did not show any correlation (p > 0.05) with APA regardless of whether the water column was mixed or stratified. These correlations suggest that temperature played a critical role in regulating the APA when the water column was mixed (October to March), and DO or inorganic nutrient contents (May to September) when the water column was stratified.																			0948-3055					MAR 31	2000	21	2					139	149		10.3354/ame021139	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame021139													WOS:000086766400004

Reproductive History and Nest Environment Are Correlated with Circulating Androgen and Glucocorticoid Concentrations in a Parental Care-Providing Teleost Fish	PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL ZOOLOGY												Using a long-term study population of wild smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu in a connected river-lake system, we investigated whether circulating glucocorticoid (cortisol) and androgen (testosterone) concentrations are influenced by reproductive investment and nesting environment in fish providing nest-guarding paternal care. For all individuals, we collected measures of reproductive history and the value of current parental care. We assessed nest environment and monitored individuals to quantify seasonal reproductive success. Finally, we measured circulating cortisol concentrations following a standardized stressor and circulating testosterone concentrations. Using general linear models, we found that poststress circulating cortisol concentrations were positively related to water temperature and were higher in fish nesting in the river than in the lake. Circulating testosterone concentrations were negatively related to water temperature and were higher in reproductively experienced fish. When considering the factors that influence reproductive success, we found that only parental size was positively related to current nest success. In summary, the results demonstrate that nesting environment is correlated with parental stress responses during parental care, while reproductive history and nesting environment are correlated with circulating androgen concentrations. Collectively, these results offer insight into the roles of both glucocorticoid and androgen steroid hormones during parental care in teleost fish.

Evidence from two species in a marine-derived midwater stratified crater lake on Satonda Island (Sumbawa, Indonesia) suggests their production of gemmules (resting bodies), a rare trait in marine sponges but common in freshwater forms, may be a survival mechanism in the lake's harsh environment. With its epilimnion hydrochemistry-characterized by changing alkalinity, salinity, and O-2 levels over the region's wet and dry seasons-the lake sustains only a few marine macroscopic organisms, among them the suberitid sponges Protosuberites lacustris comb. nov. and Suberites sp. (Hadromerida: Suberitida). Both species belong to the same group as sponges reported from other marine-derived lakes with strongly varying and extreme environmental (especially chemical) parameters. The morphological characters, taxonomic position, ecological adaptations, environmental conditions, and biota associated with the sponges in this ecologically unique site are presented here.

J	Leitao, M; Morata, SM; Rodriguez, S; Vergon, JP				Leitao, M; Morata, SM; Rodriguez, S; Vergon, JP			The Effect of perturbations on phytoplankton assemblages in a deep reservoir (Vouglans, France)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Disturbances, such as rainfall and hydrological management of Vouglans reservoir, seem to influence the establishment of the ecological system inside this man-made lake. In this paper, the main effect of these disturbances are changes in the z(mix):z(eu) ratio, with a shift in the composition and phytoplankton dynamics, and consequently in the Shannon's diversity. The seasonal changes found in the surface layers of Vouglans reservoir were typical for mesotrophic and temperate lakes, but some perturbations induced the 'reversion' to an earlier stage in the expected successional pattern during the stratification period. This early-state displayed an intensive proliferation of the filamentous ulotrichal Planctonema lauterbornii, which remained dominant in terms of abundance from the middle to the end of the stratification. The beginning of this period was characterized by the highest value of Shannon diversity index, followed by its marked decrease, whilst z(mix):z(eu) remained around 1. Despite the environmental variations which induced the reversion in this expected pattern, we found some sort of equilibrium, that is, stability in the assemblage simply expressed as a 'no-change situation', although not in the sense of equilibrium inside a competitive system. Moreover, peculiar freshwater red tides occurred in this reservoir involving Rhodomonas lacustris and Peridiniopsis durandi, whose dynamical events were also influenced by external forces.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUL	2003	502	1-3					73	83		10.1023/B:HYDR.0000004271.08002.73	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000004271.08002.73													WOS:000186636900006
J	Burneo, PC; Gunkel, G				Burneo, PC; Gunkel, G			Ecology of a high Andean stream, Rio Itambi, Otavalo, Ecuador	LIMNOLOGICA												A high Andean stream in the equatorial zone of Ecuador, the Rio Itambi, located at 2,600 to 4,600 m a.s.l., was studied to describe its physical structure, geomorphology, water chemistry and biodiversity. The Itambi catchment basin is characterized in its upper part by the volcanic sierra with > 70% slope, and in its lower part by lake deposits. The length of Rio Itambi is 17 km with a catchment basin of 11,271 ha; the annual flow amounts to 0.07-0.5 m(3)/s. Stream structure is evaluated using a modification of the German "Geomoiphological Structure Classification Method" with six main parameters (development of stream bed., longitudinal profile, transversal profile, bed structure, stream bank structure, and surrounding environment). Nowadays an impact of Rio Itambi's stream structure occurs due to anthropogenic activities. The water quality of Rio Itambi is presented on the basis of a monthly monitoring, and a comparison of rainy and dry season is given. An impact on quality is caused by human activities (sewage input, cattle raising), by landslides with a remodelling of the stream bed and by a low oxygen concentration due to altitude. Flora of stream banks as well as diatoms, macrophytes and fauna of stream bed were determined, and within the stream, biodiversity is low. In the upper part of the stream, this seems to be an effect of low oxygen saturation values and of landslide that remodel the stream bed, and in the lower part of the stream it is due to anthropogenic damage by sewage input.																			0075-9511					APR	2003	33	1					29	43		10.1016/S0075-9511(03)80005-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0075-9511(03)80005-1													WOS:000182973300004

Use of Wild Rice (Zizania palustris L.) in Paddy-Scale Bioassays for Assessing Potential Use of Mining-Influenced Water for Irrigation	MINE WATER AND THE ENVIRONMENT												As surface water resources become more intensely used, and occasionally non-useable, consideration of non-conventional water resources for anthropogenic use has become more prevalent. Potentially critical non-conventional water sources include flooded mine-pit lakes. However, water in these lakes can contain potentially problematic concentrations of contaminants of concern. We evaluated the potential use of elevated sulphate (SO4) mining-influenced waters with low to non-detect metals concentrations for irrigation of wild rice (Zizania palustris L.; WR), a culturally and economically important species. Two flow-through in-situ paddies were developed adjacent to two mine-pit lakes with differing chemical water characteristics; specifically, Pit A contained approximate to 350 mg SO4 L-1 and Pit C contained approximate to 1350 mg SO4 L-1. Throughout the course of multiple consecutive growing seasons, no adverse WR responses to these mining-influenced water exposures were observed. Based on data and observations from this study, potential use of mining-influenced waters containing elevated SO4 as the primary contaminant for appropriate irrigation purposes is supported. However, site-specific conditions and potential environmental risks must be considered prior to use of mining-influenced waters for anthropogenic applications.																			1025-9112	1616-1068				DEC	2022	41	4					938	953		10.1007/s10230-022-00908-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10230-022-00908-0		NOV 2022						36518101					WOS:000885231900001

Mill. (balsam fir) and Picea glauca (Moench) Voss (white spruce) to %PAR in two large (>1 ha) mixed-species forest sites, one in eastern Canada at Lac Duparquet, Quebec, and one in western Canada at Calling Lake, Alberta. Overstory tree locations and dimensions were obtained from aerial photographs or ground measurements and allometric relationships. Seasonal %PAR calculated by MIXLIGHT for the Calling Lake site was very similar to seasonal %PAR measured by quantum sensors (n = 5, %PAR range = 15%-33%, r = 0.93). Daily measurements of %PAR were also predicted well by simulations at both sites (n = 34-36, %PAR range = 1%-45%, r = 0.76). Functional relationships, designed to saturate at the maximum height growth potential of these sites, were developed to predict sapling height growth from simulated seasonal %PAR and initial height (R-2 = 0.74). These results demonstrate the potential of the MIXLIGHT simulator for estimating PAR at microsites within heterogeneous forests and for modeling understory tree growth.

The results based on the hybridization indicated that relative 16S rRNA abundance (RNA index) of Bacteria and Gram-negative mesophilic SRB detected by probes EUB 338 and SRB 385 with respect to all known organisms as detected by probe UNIV 1400 in surface sediments (0-6 cm) were 71% and 4.1% on average for 15 months, respectively. The RNA indexes of the major SRB genera to all bacteria in the 0-3-cm and 3-6-cm layers, on average, were 1.4% for Desulfobulbus, 0.6% for Desulfobacterium, and 0.5% for Desulfovibrio. The RNA indexes of Desulfobulbus showed relatively high values in those of detected SRB during almost all of the study periods, while Desulfobacterium and Desulfovibrio exhibited low relative abundance. The RN4 index of Desulfobulbus correlated with the rate of sulfate reduction in the sediment. Therefore: Desulfobulbus appears to be dominant in the active SRB population in the surface sediment.

Determination of high-resolution soil texture profile at the hillslope scale	GEODERMA												Large-scale quantification of soil physical properties is challenging due to their inherent spatial and temporal variability. This variability determines hydrologic and biogeochemical behavior of soils and influences their ecosystem responses. This study investigated electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) in an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) framework to test spatially variable linear and non-linear models to predict in-situ soil textures up to a depth of 6 m for the Piedmont Physiographic Region in Georgia. Soil resistivity was measured for several months across a hillslope and used as input for the ANN along with relative depth of investigation and lake levels, since our study sites were located on a shoreline. The models were cross validated and tested at independent sites. Overall, soil texture was strongly correlated to depth (-0.7 to 0.85) while resistivity had a significant yet weaker correlation (-0.27 to 0.33). The correlation between depth and texture changed markedly in the saprolite layers such that ANN-based models performed better than multivariate regression, capturing the linear rela-tionship between depth and texture in the shallow layers and the correlation between resistivity and texture for deeper depths. Within the ANN framework, depth alone generated an R2 = 0.55 and RMSE = 9.12 % for an independent site validation and resistivity improved the metrics marginally to 0.6 and 8.47 %, respectively. The R2 and RMSE for the deeper saprolite depths, however, improved from 0.01 and 6.36 % to 0.31 and 5.94 %, respectively. The predictions were also robust when based on a single ERT survey and time of data collection (i. e., dry vs wet season). The ANN model predictions were sensitive to the structure of model inputs with the best model importing resistivity and lake levels first, and the second layer processing the obtained information together with depth. These ERT based ANN models provided finer information than what is currently available from SSURGO while covering deeper portions of the subsurface and maintaining high vertical resolution.

Stratified Odds Ratios for Evaluating NBA Players Based on their Plus/Minus Statistics	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS IN SPORTS												In this paper, I estimate adjusted odds ratios by fitting stratified logistic regression models to binary response variables, games won or lost, with plus/minus statistics as explanatory variables. Adapted from ice hockey, the plus/minus statistic credits an NBA player one or more points whenever his team scores while he is on the basketball court. Conversely, the player is debited minus one or more points whenever the opposing team scores. Throughout the NBA season, the league's better players are likely to have positive plus/minus statistics as reported by Yahoo! Sports and 82games.com. Crude or unadjusted odds ratios estimate the relative probabilities of a player having a positive plus/minus in a win, versus a negative plus/minus in a loss. Home and away games are twin strata with teams playing 41 home games and 41 road games during an 82-game regular season. Stratum-specific odds ratios vary because some players perform better at home than on the road and vice versa. In order to adjust for home court advantage, stratified odds ratios and their 95 percent confidence intervals are estimated for each of the Los Angeles Lakers during the 2009-2010 regular season.																			2194-6388	1559-0410				FEB	2011	7	2							5	10.2202/1559-0410.1320	http://dx.doi.org/10.2202/1559-0410.1320													WOS:000443075300005

Water taken from Zegrzynskie Lake is characterized by elevated content of humic substances and algae bloom in hot seasons. The water is ozonated and chlorinated. The study was performed from October 1995 to November 1996. The water was analyzed on various stages of treatment and the following parameters were determined: HAAs, THMs, DOG, GOD, humic substances, UV absorbance, color and temperature. The big increase of HAAs concentrations occurred after water chlorination, up to 120 mu g/l. In 44% it was DCAA and in 40% TCAA. The highest concentration of HAAs was noticed in May and June, when water temperature was the highest and concentration of organic matter the biggest. The changes of HAAs concentrations with time were similar to those in THMs concentrations. The laboratory experiments on the water ozonation and chlorination indicated that ozonation has small influence on the HAAs formation. The study of the HAAs volatization during water boiling showed that removal of HAAs is rather small. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All fights reserved.

J	Vinebrooke, RD; Leavitt, PR				Vinebrooke, RD; Leavitt, PR			Effects of ultraviolet radiation on periphyton in an alpine lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY					Symposium on Regional Assessment of Freshwater Ecosystems and Climate Change in North America	OCT 24-26, 1994	LEESBURG, VA	Amer Soc Limnol & Oceanog, N Amer Benthol Soc, US EPA, US Geol Survey				Many alpine lakes have low concentrations of ultraviolet (UV) radiation-absorbing dissolved organic matter, yet receive higher UV radiation flux than low-elevation lakes. We tested whether ambient UV radiation affected periphyton development in a small alpine lake in Banff National Park, Canada. After 30 d, total periphytic biomass and chlorophyll accrual on artificial substrates were enhanced similar to 100% (t-test, P < 0.05) by removal of UV radiation (<400 nm). The inhibitory effect of UV radiation was species-specific, significantly suppressing (Bonferroni-adjusted t-test, P < 0.05) Achnanthes minutissima Kutzing but not other colonists. Although taxa apparently differed in their sensitivity to UV radiation, periphyton communities remained dominated by early successional taxa, especially A. minutissima (75% of total biovolume). In contrast, natural epilithic communities were dominated by cyanobacteria (Anabaena subcylindrica Borge, Calothrix sp.). These findings suggest that ambient UV radiation at alpine sites can suppress periphyton development by inhibiting littoral diatom production during the short ice-free season (July-September).

J	Takagi, S; Kikuchi, E; Doi, H; Shikano, S				Takagi, S; Kikuchi, E; Doi, H; Shikano, S			Swimming behaviour of Chironomus acerbiphilus larvae in Lake Katanuma	HYDROBIOLOGIA												We conducted a seasonal survey of the swimming behaviour of Chironomus acerbiphilus larvae in volcanic Lake Katanuma from April 1998 to December 2001. Swimming C. acerbiphilus density was much higher than other chironomid species in lakes. All C. acerbiphilus larvae (1st through 4th instars) swam, but the earlier instars (especially the 1st) had the greatest densities and fluctuations. First instars were never found in the benthic population. This result indicates that the 1st-instar larvae are planktonic. Low water temperature (below about 10 degrees C) resulted in the seasonal disappearance of swimming chironomid larvae. Chemical factors - oxygen depletion or presence of hydrogen sulfide - also restricted the distribution of swimming and benthic larvae. Larvae were distributed only in the oxygen-rich part of the lake bottom and swam only in the oxygen-rich layer of the water column. The density of older swimming C. acerbiphilus (3rd and 4th instars) tended to increase with increasing benthic larval densities. The chemical stress of oxygen depletion or presence of hydrogen sulfide during holomixis within and after the stratification period leads to conspicuous swimming behaviour of benthic C. acerbiphilus larvae. Almost all C. acerbiphilus larvae died on this occasion.

J	Esterby, SR				Esterby, SR			Review of methods for the detection and estimation of trends with emphasis on water quality applications	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Methods for the detection and estimation of trends which are suitable for the type of data sets available from water quality and atmospheric deposition monitoring programmes are considered. Parametric and non-parametric methods which are based on the assumption of monotonic trend and which account for seasonality through blocking on season are described. The topics included are heterogeneity of trend, missing data, covariates, censored data, serial dependence and multivariate extensions. The basis for the non-parametric methods being the method of choice for current large data sets of short to moderate length is reviewed. A more general definition of trend as the component of gradual change over time is consistent with another group of methods and some examples are given. Spatial temporal data sets and longer temporal records are also briefly considered. A broad overview of the topic of trend analysis is given, with technicalities left to the references cited. The necessity of defining what is meant by trend in the context of the design and objectives of the programme is emphasized, as is the need to model the variability in the data more generally.																			0885-6087	1099-1085				FEB	1996	10	2					127	149																WOS:A1996TZ26300002

K.) over up to 2 year annual cycles. Five particular lake algae (Anabaena spiroides Klebahn, Anabaena flos-aquae Brebisson ex Bornet & Flahault, Anabaena circinalis Rabenhorst, Microcystis aeruginosa Kutzing emend. Elenkin and Eudorina elegans Ehrenberg) were found to be the major contributors to cell-associated mucilage, particularly M. aeruginosa. Calculation of the total amount of cell-associated mucilage in the phytoplankton samples showed that it occupied 0.0001-0.007% (the latter during a bloom of Microcystis) of lake water volume within the epilimnion. Seasonal changes in the total volume of associated mucilage reflected the succession of mucilage-producing algal species in Rostherne Mere, which was closely correlated with the physico-chemical (temperature, oxygen, pH, nutrients) and biological (Secchi depth, phytoplankton) parameters within the lake. High levels of cell-associated mucilage present in the lake may have potential for binding metals or other ions in the aquatic environment. Colourimetric determination of the concentration of soluble EPS revealed concentrations of between 2.5 and 60 mg l(-1), with peak levels during the bacillariophyceaen bloom and late clear water phase. The second phase did not appear to relate directly to changes in algal population, and may result from bacterial activity, algal lysis or zooplankton activity. As soluble EPS forms a major component of the total amount of dissolved carbon in lakes, the study of the soluble EPS is important to understand the carbon cycle in freshwaters. No direct correlation occurred between algal-associated mucilage and soluble EPS over a single annual cycle.

J	Hay, WW				Hay, WW			Tectonics and climate	GEOLOGISCHE RUNDSCHAU												Tectonics and climate are both directly and indirectly related. The direct connection is between uplift, atmospheric circulation, and the hydrologic cycle. The indirect links are via subduction, volcanism, the introduction of gasses into the atmosphere, and through erosion and consumption of atmospheric gases by chemical weathering. Rifting of continental blocks involves broad upwarping followed by subsidence of a central valley and uplift of marginal shoulders. The result is an evolving regional climate which has been repeated many times in the Phanerozoic: first a vapor-trapping arch, followed by a rift valley with fresh-water lakes, culminating in an arid rift bordered by mountains intercepting incoming precipitation. Convergence tectonics affects climate on a larger scale. A mountain range is a barrier to atmospheric circulation, especially if perpendicular to the circulation. It also traps water vapor converting latent to sensible heat. Broad uplift results in a shorter path for both incoming and outgoing radiation resulting in seasonal climate extremes with reversals of atmospheric pressure and enhanced monsoonal circulation. Volcanism affects climate by introducing ash and aerosols into the atmosphere, but unless these are injected into the stratosphere, they have little effect. Stratospheric injection is most likely to oc cur at high latitudes, where the thickness of the troposphere is minimal. Volcanoes introduce CO2, a greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere. Geochemical effects of tectonic uplift and unroofing relate to the weathering of silicate rocks, the means by which CO2 is removed from the atmosphere-ocean system on long-term time scales.																			0016-7835					SEP	1996	85	3					409	437		10.1007/BF02369000	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02369000													WOS:A1996VL05100004
J	Compton, JA; Kerfoot, WC				Compton, JA; Kerfoot, WC			Colonizing inland lakes: Consequences of YOY fish ingesting the spiny cladoceran (Bythotrephes cederstroemi)	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Recently the exotic cladoceran Bythotrephes cederstroemi colonized inland lakes in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, facing warmer temperatures and greater exposure to smaller fish than in coastal waters of Lake Superior. However, the long caudal appendage (spine) of Bythotrephes protects it against young-of-the-year (YOY)fish predation. After experience, small fish (30-60 mm TL) develop aversion behavior, explaining why this prey item rarely occurs in their stomachs, despite ingestion of other prey species with core body lengths between 2-3 mm. Here we compare laboratory and field size-dependent feeding patterns for YOY of two common fish species (yellow perch, Perca flavescens; bluegills, Lepomis macrochirus) with field patterns from a typical bait-fish species (spottail shiner, Notropis hudsonius). Behavioral responses of bluegills indicate that deterrence is not a simple linear function of spine length, but that longer spines offer disproportionate protection, explaining why long spines are present at birth. Stomach contents of small perch (30-60 mm TL) confirm size-dependent avoidance, with only occasional consumption of Bythotrephes and rare puncture of stomach walls. However, examples of ingestion and frequent stomach puncture were found in the thinner-walled stomachs of spottail shiners. Out of 140 small fish collected when this species encountered high densities of Bythotrephes, 77 had Bythotrephes in stomachs or lower digestive tracts, and 50 (65%) had spines protruding through gut walls. Clearly, this bait-fish species is capable not only of ingesting large numbers of Bythotrephes, but of receiving injury in the process.																			0380-1330						2004	30			1			315	326		10.1016/S0380-1330(04)70394-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(04)70394-9													WOS:000227991500022

Bacterioplankton dispersal and biogeochemical function across Alaskan Arctic catchments	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												In Arctic catchments, bacterioplankton are dispersed through soils and streams, both of which freeze and thaw/flow in phase, seasonally. To characterize this dispersal and its potential impact on biogeochemistry, we collected bacterioplankton and measured stream physicochemistry during snowmelt and after vegetation senescence across multiple stream orders in alpine, tundra, and tundra-dominated-by-lakes catchments. In all catchments, differences in community composition were associated with seasonal thaw, then attachment status (i.e. free floating or sediment associated), and then stream order. Bacterioplankton taxonomic diversity and richness were elevated in sediment-associated fractions and in higher-order reaches during snowmelt. Families Chthonomonadaceae, Pyrinomonadaceae, and Xiphinematobacteraceae were abundantly different across seasons, while Flavobacteriaceae and Microscillaceae were abundantly different between free-floating and sediment-associated fractions. Physicochemical data suggested there was high iron (Fe+) production (alpine catchment); Fe+ production and chloride (Cl-) removal (tundra catchment); and phosphorus (SRP) removal and ammonium (NH4+) production (lake catchment). In tundra landscapes, these 'hot spots' of Fe+ production and Cl- removal accompanied shifts in species richness, while SRP promoted the antecedent community. Our findings suggest that freshet increases bacterial dispersal from headwater catchments to receiving catchments, where bacterioplankton-mineral relations stabilized communities in free-flowing reaches, but bacterioplankton-nutrient relations stabilized those punctuated by lakes.

Such changes are common drivers of genetic structure and adaptation. Embothrium coccineum (Proteaceae) is an emblematic tree of the South American temperate forest (around 20 degrees S of latitude) that has strongly been affected by topographic and climatic events. Previous studies have shown a marked genetic structure in this species, and distinct ecotypes have been described. Yet, little is known about their adaptive genetic responses. The main goal of this study was to investigate the effects of historical and contemporary landscape features affecting the genetic diversity and connectivity of E. coccineum throughout its current natural distribution. Using over 2000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we identified two genetic groups (a Northern and a Central--Southern group) that diverged around 2.8 million years ago. The level of genetic structure was higher among populations within the Northern genetic group than within the Central--Southern group. We propose that these differences in genetic structure may be due to differences in the assemblages of pollinators and in the evolutionary histories of the two genetic groups. Moreover, the data displayed a strong pattern of isolation by the environment in E. coccineum, suggesting that selection could have led to adaptive divergence among localities. We propose that in the Chilean temperate forest, the patterns of genetic variation in E. coccineum reflect both a Quaternary phylogenetic imprint and signatures of selection as a consequence of a strong environmental gradient.					; Alarcon, Diego/I-1990-2016; Alarcón, Diego/I-1990-2016; Hasbun, Rodrigo/F-8454-2014	Bertin-Benavides, Ariana/0000-0001-7510-0338; Hasbun, Rodrigo/0000-0002-4852-6154; Alarcon, Diego/0000-0003-3751-047X; Toro-Nunez, Oscar/0000-0001-6598-0511; Sepulveda Espinoza, Francisco/0000-0002-3623-6336; Guillemin, Marie-Laure/0000-0001-5703-7662; Varas-Myrik, Antonio/0000-0003-2787-6718													2045-7758					NOV	2022	12	11							e9474	10.1002/ece3.9474	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.9474								36381388					WOS:000880426700001

However, agricultural intensification and climate change have a negative impact on the available arable land, soil microbiome and, consequently, crop productivity. This study investigated the effects of seasonal changes on soil microbiome associated with runner bean cultivation. The results indicated that the presence of the runner bean and the soil processes affecting the carbon cycle differentially shaped the structure of the soil microbial community. Ultimately, this study highlights the importance of investigating soil microbiome in agriculture and is expected to contribute to future research for the development of novel preservation strategies for native soil ecosystem services. Leguminous crops play a key role in food production and agroecosystem sustainability. However, climate change and agricultural intensification have a significant impact on the available arable land, soil microbiome functions, and ultimately, crop productivity. The "Prespa bean" (Phaseolous coccineous L.) is an important leguminous crop for the agricultural economy of the rural areas surrounding the lake, Mikri Prespa, which is of significant ecological importance. The seasonal effects on soil microbiome structure, diversity and functions associated with the runner bean cultivation were investigated using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. The results indicated that the presence of the runner bean differentially shaped the soil microbial community structure. The runner bean was implicated in the recruitment of specific bacteria, by favouring or excluding specific classes or even phyla. Soil functions involved in nutrient availability and carbon metabolism, among other pathways, were associated with microbiome-plant interactions. The temporal relative abundance shifts could be explained by the impact of soil organic matter, the fertilization regime, and the equilibrium in carbon metabolic processes. This research has shown the effect of runner bean cultivation on the soil microbiome which, in future, may potentially contribute to research into sustainable agricultural productivity and the protection of soil ecosystem services.					; Stavridou, Evangelia/ISB-6465-2023; Madesis, Panagiotis/AAL-5980-2020	Lagiotis, Georgios/0000-0002-1260-3357; Madesis, Panagiotis/0000-0003-1447-3514; Karamichali, Ioanna/0000-0003-2664-9003; Stavridou, Evangelia/0000-0002-6579-3107														2079-7737				NOV	2022	11	11							1595	10.3390/biology11111595	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology11111595								36358296					WOS:000895306600001
J	Pöysä, H				Pöysä, H			Dynamics of habitat distribution in breeding mallards:: assessing the applicability of current habitat selection models	OIKOS												The applicability of ideal free, ideal despotic and ideal preemptive habitat selection models to explain dynamics of habitat distribution of breeding mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) was explored. Data from 35 lakes studied between 1985 and 2000 were used to examine overall habitat distribution of breeding pairs, breeding success in different habitats, within-year order of habitat occupation, and density dependence of habitat distribution and breeding success. Two habitat types, rich and poor, were defined based on the structure and luxuriance of shore vegetation; each lake belonged to one or the other of the habitat types. Breeding pairs used the rich habitat more than expected, breeding density also being higher there than in the poor habitat. Both average brood density and breeding success were higher in the rich habitat than in the poor. Breeding success was not density dependent, neither when analysed separately for the habitat types, nor in the study area in general. Within season, arriving mallard pairs did not occupy rich lakes earlier than poor lakes. An isodar analysis based on between-year variation of the breeding density in rich and poor habitats revealed that habitat distribution of breeding pairs was not density dependent. By contrast, density in the rich habitat increased and proportional use of the poor habitat decreased with increasing overall population density, i.e. the rich habitat got increasingly crowded. None of the habitat selection models considered was applicable to explain the dynamics of habitat distribution of breeding mallards.

J	Nagarajan, B; Yau, MK; Schuepp, PH				Nagarajan, B; Yau, MK; Schuepp, PH			The effects of small water bodies on the atmospheric heat and water budgets over the MacKenzie River Basin	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												The effects of small water bodies or lakes on the surface sensible and latent heat fluxes and the transport of heat and water vapour in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) over the Mackenzie River Basin (MRB) are studied from two cases, which occurred on 2 and 8 June 1999 during the warm season. The synoptic condition for the cases is representative of about 33% of the synoptic situation over the MRB. The two events are simulated using the Canadian mesoscale compressible community (MC2) model. A one-way nesting grid approach is employed with the highest resolution of 100 m over a domain of 100 km(2). Experiments were conducted with (LAKE) and without (NOLAKE) the presence of small water bodies, whose size distribution is obtained through an inversion algorithm using information of their linear dimension determined from aircraft measurement of surface temperature during MAGS (the Mackenzie GEWEX (Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment) Study) in 1999. The water bodies are assumed to be distributed randomly in space with a fractional area coverage of 10% over the MRB. The results show that, in the presence of lakes, the domain-averaged surface sensible heat flux on 2 June 1999 (8 June 1999) decreases by 9-3% (6.6%). The surface latent heat flux is enhanced by 18.2% (81.5%). Low-level temperature advection and the lake surface temperature affect the air-land/lake temperature contrast, which in turn controls the sensible heat flux. In the absence of lakes the surface wind speed impacts the latent heat flux, but in the presence of lakes the moisture availability and the atmospheric surface layer stability control the latent heat flux. The enhancement is smaller on 2 June 1999 as a result of a stable surface layer caused by the presence of colder lake temperatures. The domain-averaged apparent heat source and moisture sink due to turbulent transports were also computed. The results show that, when lakes are present, heating and drying occur in the lowest 100 m from the surface. Above 100 m and within the ABL, there was apparent cooling. However, the apparent moistening profiles reveal that lakes tend to moisten the ABL through transfer of moisture from the lowest 50-100 m layer.

J	LAMPERT, W				LAMPERT, W			PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY OF THE SIZE AT 1ST REPRODUCTION IN DAPHNIA - THE IMPORTANCE OF MATERNAL SIZE	ECOLOGY												I propose a mechanism of rapid phenotypic response of size at first reproduction (SFR) that may allow relatively large species of Daphnia to survive under variable fish predation. A single clone of D. magna isolated from a shallow lake with planktivorous fish is able to express the full range of SFR observed in the field (1.8-3.0 mm) when raised under controlled temperature and food conditions in the laboratory. Control of SFR is predominantly based on size differences in the eggs of the first and the following broods of Daphnia. First-brood eggs are smaller. They hatch into smaller neonates that mature at a smaller size. In the lake, fish may selectively remove large females, and this will increase the share of first-brood females in the population. Offspring of these females will mature at a much smaller size, so that the size response to predation is intensified. When predation ceases, some females can grow to larger sizes. They will contribute many large offspring to the population because the they have larger clutch sizes and larger eggs. This leads to a rapid shift toward large SFR. A single clone of D. magna was hatched from isolated eggs to measure the components of maternal size dependency, which is basic to this hypothesis. Strong positive relationships were found between female size and egg size, egg size and neonate size, neonate size and SFR, size of a female and its offspring's SFR, and female size and clutch size. The predicted pattem of SFR in relation to average body size is found in the lake, but the pattem of egg size is not clear, as egg size is strongly affected by changes in food abundance. This mechanism of phenotypic response may be a fortuitous effect of selection for maximum egg numbers in the first brood, but the increase of offspring size with maternal size may also be adaptive itself.																			0012-9658	1939-9170				JUL	1993	74	5					1455	1466		10.2307/1940074	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1940074													WOS:A1993LK42900015

The fish studied were crucian carp (Carassius auratus (gibelio) langsdoifii), an omnivorous species. Fish and sediments were collected from 14 rivers and lakes located in remote areas, agricultural areas, and small and large cities throughout Japan. The total toxic equivalent (TEQ) dioxin concentrations at the three remote sites were about 20% of the concentrations at the other I I sites, which all had similar concentrations. The average concentrations in fish collected from these 11 sites were 0.69 pg TEQ g(-1) wet wt. (95% Cl 0.52-0.85) or 57.3 pg TEQ g(-1) fat (95% CI 47.9-66.7). There were notable differences in congener profiles of polychlorinated p-dibenzodioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) between sampling areas. A chemical mass balance method was used to estimate the proportions of dioxin contributions from different sources. The sampling areas were classified into four groups on the basis of the predominant source of dioxin contamination: a combustion group, a chlornitrofen herbicide group, a chlornitrofen and pentachlorphenol herbicide group, and a remote group. The congener profiles of dioxin like polychlorinated biphenyls (DL-PCBs) were almost the same in all areas and close to those in Kanechlor, which indicates that pollution from PCB products has spread throughout Japan. From samples collected during the spawning season, it was determined that about 20% of the dioxins in adult females were transferred to the eggs, resulting in higher dioxin concentrations in adult males than in females. Biota-sediment accumulation factors (BSAFs) of 2,3,7,8-substituted PCDDs/DFs for crucian carp were larger than those of non-2,3,7,8-substituted congeners, and BASFs decreased with increasing number of chlorines. The BSAFs of DL-PCBs were 10 times greater than those of PCDDs/DFs, and BSAFs of mono-ortho type DL-PCBs were higher than those of non-ortho types. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

J	HOLLANDER, DJ; MCKENZIE, JA				HOLLANDER, DJ; MCKENZIE, JA			CO2 CONTROL ON CARBON-ISOTOPE FRACTIONATION DURING AQUEOUS PHOTOSYNTHESIS - A PALEO-PCO2 BAROMETER	GEOLOGY												A carbon-isotope study of the various carbon phases during an annual productivity cycle in eutrophic Lake Greifen, Switzerland, indicates that values for the photosynthetic isotopic fractionation (epsilon-p) between dissolved CO2 and particulate organic carbon (POC) and delta-C-13-POC increase in response to decreasing concentrations of dissolved carbon dioxide ([CO2(aq)]) due to increased carbon demand during photosynthesis. Seasonal changes in the dominant biological assemblage may also be related to [CO2(aq)] and may influence the fractionation as a consequence of changes in the dominant photosynthetic mechanism (CO2 vs. HCO3- utilization). A logarithmic relation between epsilon-p and [CO2(aq)] may be useful for evaluating partial pressures of paleoatmospheric CO2.																			0091-7613					SEP	1991	19	9					929	932		10.1130/0091-7613(1991)019<0929:CCOCIF>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/0091-7613(1991)019<0929:CCOCIF>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1991GF11500016

Response of sex ratio to timing of breeding in the small cyprinid Gnathopogon caerulescens	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The influence of hatching date on the sex ratio of wild Gnathopogon caerulescens was examined. Cohorts reared from eggs collected in the early and middle parts of the spawning season showed almost balanced sex ratios, with female bias in some cohorts. Cohorts born later in the season mostly displayed male bias, and the mean proportion of males later in the season was significantly higher than in early- and mid-season cohorts. These results indicate that the sex ratio of G. caerulescens changes with the time of breeding, increasing along with the ambient water temperature of the lake.																			0022-1112	1095-8649				OCT	2015	87	4					958	966		10.1111/jfb.12768	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfb.12768								26370909					WOS:000362454800009

Growth and reproductive biology of Capoeta damascina (Valenciennes, 1842) from a tributary of Tigris	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES SCIENCES												Growth and reproductive attributes were determined for Capoeta damascina, an endemic fish species from west of Iran. A total of 147 specimens of both sexes were sampled monthly from November 2008 to October 2009. The overall sex ratio was female biased. Males were aged 0-4 years and females 0-5 years. The von Bertalanffy growth parameters were estimated as; L-inf=34.81 cm, k=0.27 year(-1), t(0)=-0.65 for males plus unsexed samples, L-inf =46.29 cm, k=0.22 year(-1), t(0) =-0.59 for females plus unsexed samples and L-inf =67.52 cm, k=0.12 year(-1), t(0)=-0.79 for whole samples. The length-weight relationships were W=0.021L(2.815) for males, W=0.022L(2.824) for females and W=0.020L(2.836) for combined sexes, all of which exhibited a negative allometric growth. Spawning season started in May, ascending to June and ended in July for both sexes. Length at 50% maturity was estimated as 12.35 cm for males and 15.14 cm for females. Fecundity ranged from 1551 (2 years old) to 20523 (5 years old) eggs per fish. Losing of large individuals and decreasing in size at first maturity were observed in the studied population compared to data reported from other C. damascina populations, which could reflect an effect of overexploitation.					; Kamangar, Barzan/AAY-1795-2020; Ghaderi, Edris/JWA-4956-2024	Ghaderi, Edris/0000-0002-9875-7735; 													1562-2916					OCT	2015	14	4					956	969																WOS:000368440700013

Genetic differentiation of sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka from Kamchatka River basin and the lake-river systems of the west coast of the bering sea as inferred from data on single nucleotide polymorphism	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF GENETICS												The variability of 45 single nucleotide polymorphism loci (SNP) was studied in sockeye salmon from the Kamchatka River basin and four lake-river systems of the west coast of the Bering Sea. Based on the genetic differentiation estimates for the largest sockeye salmon populations of Eastern Kamchatka and Chukotka, the examined samples were combined into two regional groups represented by the population of the Kamchatka River drainage, which included numerous local subpopulations and seasonal races, and the northern population grouping from the rivers of Olutorsko-Navarinsky region, wherein the sockeye salmon from Maynypilginskaya Lake-River system was relatively isolated. Considerable divergence was observed between the island (Sarannoe Lake, Bering Island) and continental populations. Genetic heterogeneity was revealed and groups of earlyand late-maturing individuals were identified in the sample of late-run sockeye salmon from Kamchatka River. In Apuka River, subdivision of the spawning run into two genetically distinct spatial and temporal groupings was also observed. The results suggested that the differentiation of sockeye salmon samples by single nucleotide substitution frequencies was largely due to differences in the direction and strength of local selection at some loci in the population complexes and intrapopulation groupings from the examined river basins of Eastern Kamchatka, Chukotka, and Commander Islands.

A retrospective analysis of suspended solids deposition in Onondaga Lake, New York: Composition, temporal patterns, and drivers	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Long-term and seasonal temporal patterns in the deposition of total (TSS), fixed (FSS) and volatile suspended solids (VSS) were documented for eutrophic Ca2+-rich Onondaga Lake, New York, for the 1980-2008 interval. Weekly collections were made from sediment traps deployed below the thermocline from April to October in the deepest area of the lake (19.5 m). Downward fluxes of TSS (DFTSS), FSS (DFFSS) and VSS (DFVSS) decreased 42, 38, and 41%, respectively, following closure of a soda ash facility in 1986 that discharged ionic waste to the lake. The DFTSS decreased 47% from 2007 to 2008, driven mostly by lower CaCO3 deposition. Sediment accumulation rates derived from dry weight deposition were estimated to decrease from 0.8 cm/yr during 1980-1986 to 0.4 cm/yr during 1987-2007 to 0.2 cm/yr in 2008. On average, DFCaCO3 accounted for 83% of DFFSS and 69% of DFTSS. The event-like character observed for DFFSS was attributed to variations in CaCO3 precipitation, probably driven by variations in temperature, pH and the availability of nucleation sites. The DFVSS decreased 56% from 2.5 g/m(2).d to 1.1 g/m(2).d over the 1989 to 2008 interval. Decreased phosphorus loading from a municipal wastewater treatment facility explained 67% of the interannual variations in DFVSS. Weekly variations in the DFVSS were generally correlated with chlorophyll levels in the upper waters, and maximum values were observed during major phytoplankton blooms. Seasonal minima of DFVSS and DFFSS occurred during clear water phases, associated with Daphnia grazing, which were observed annually from 1987 to 2002, and again in 2008. Changes in primary production and lake chemistry could have significant effects on the burial of contaminants and microbial metabolism in the sediments.																			1040-2381	2151-5530					2010	26	1					43	53		10.1080/07438141003656005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438141003656005													WOS:000280285200005
J	Li, Y; Yang, LZ; Wang, C				Li, Yong; Yang, Lin Zhang; Wang, Chao			Evaluation of fertilizing schemes for direct-seeding rice fields in Taihu Lake Basin, China	TURKISH JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY												Field experiments were performed to identify an effective fertilizing scheme for direct-seeding rice (DSR) fields in the Taibu Lake Basin in east China. Based on local traditions, 3 typical fertilizing schemes (FS-1, FS-2, and FS-3) were evaluated, in consideration of ensuring a certain rice yield and relatively low nitrogen (N) loss. The base, seedling, tillering, jointing, and panicle fertilizers for FS-1 were all 20% of 270 kg N ha(-1), those for FS-2 were 30%, 30%, 0%, 25%, and 15% of 270 kg N ha(-1), and 15%, 20%, 25%, 20%, and 20% of 220 kg N ha(-1) for FS-3, respectively. The results show that the majority of fertilizer N for DSR should be applied as topdressing fertilizer and not as base fertilizer as in transplanted rice cultivation. Increasing base fertilizer would not significantly improve the growth or yield of rice due to the low uptake of N during the seedling stage, and in turn would lead to greater N loss. Under FS-1, FS-2, and FS-3, N loss was 91.4, 103.1, and 70.5 kg ha(-1), respectively, via surface runoff volatilization, and leaching. Furthermore, using different fertilizer N methods during the rice growing season led to different N uptake by rice plants. In the present study N uptake by rice was measured at 108, 91, and 102 kg N ha(-1) under FS-1, FS-2, and FS-3, respectively. At the same time, the rice yield with FS-1, FS-2, and FS-3 was 8530, 7780, and 8620 kg ha(-1), respectively. In modern agricultural management an effective fertilizer scheme should simultaneously benefit both rice yield and the water environment. As a result, FS-3 was used in this study for DSR cultivation in the Taihu Lake Basin, which resulted in good rice yield and totally reducing N loss of 20.9-32.6 kg N ha(-1).

Impact of a Kraft Pulp and Paper Mill Effluent on Phytoplankton and Macroinvertebrates in River Nzoia, Kenya	WATER QUALITY RESEARCH JOURNAL OF CANADA					7th International Conference on Fata and Effects of Pulp and Paper Mill Effluents Returned to Canada/9th International-Water-Association Symposium on Forest Industry Wastewaters	2009	Fredericton, CANADA	Int Water Assoc				Phytoplankton and macroinvertebrate assemblages were used to assess the impact of a kraft pulp and paper mill effluent in Kenya, on River Nzoia downstream of the discharge point in relation to changes in water quality during May to June and November 2008 (rainy and dry seasons, respectively). Total phosphorus concentration increased from 0.027 mg.L-1 upstream to 0.04 mg.L-1 downstream. Ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) concentration was 0.51 mg.L-1 upstream and 0.86 mg.L-1 downstream. Nitrate concentration stood at 1.18 mg.L-1 upstream compared with the 2.23 mg.L-1 downstream. The pH changed from 4.5 to 5.0 upstream to 5.5 to 6.0 downstream, while DO increased from 6.57 to 7.03 mg.L-1 downstream. The BOD5 (biochemical oxygen demand after five days) values remained almost unchanged from 4.63 mg.L-1 upstream to 4.67 mg.L-1 downstream. Taxon composition of phytoplankton and macroinvertebrates correlated with adverse environmental gradients resulting from the mill's effluent discharge. Overall, there was a shift in composition and abundance of both phytoplankton and macroinvertebrates, with the downstream site recording high numbers of tolerant taxa (i.e., Microcystis sp. and Chironomus sp.). It was recommended that water quality monitoring with effluents of this nature be done using a combination of chemical analysis and biological indicators such as phytoplankton and macroinvertebrates.

Drought caused an observed 4.0 to 5.1 m lake-head decline between 1923 and 1938; all but three either dried completely or declined to < 1.7 m depth. From the deepest (Elk Lake), a Pb-210-dated sediment core was analyzed for ostracode species distribution and geochemistry of C. Rawsoni shells (delta(18)O, delta(13)C, Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca). Mg/Ca and delta(13)C increased during drought at the same time that salinity-tolerant ostracodes thrived, suggesting increasing salinity. However, 6180 decreased during drought, anti-correlative with Mg/Ca. A numerical model for transient response of groundwater flow to drought, modeled after that of 1923-38, was constrained by drought-end recessional strand lines observed on air photos of one lake, with strand line elevations inferred from bathymetry. Simulated lake-water-level declines in the first 15 drought years were consistent with strand line elevations. The rate of decline was exponential at drought onset, slowing as water in lakes and wetlands receded to below land surface and lake evaporation declined. A near-steady state was attained between 40 and 50 simulation years after onset of drought, with the water table from 1-5 m below the level of dry lakebeds and only the two deepest lakes still holding water. They were, however, greatly constricted in area and depth. Simulated evaporation fluxes were reduced by over 50% within 15 years, despite increased ET rates, due to lake area constriction and water table declines. Both relate to land surface morphology beneath and around lakes. Model results suggest that take-bed elevations exert control on the rate and ultimate level to which groundwater is depressed by drought. The deepest lakes in any region will tend to become the focus of groundwater flow during sustained drought once takes around it dry out. The unexpected finding of decreasing shell delta(18)O in response to drought is interpreted as some combination of source and/or evaporation-reduction effects, such as seasonality of recharge/precipitation or reduced ET flux from wetlands that seep back into lakes.

Seasonal variation in cuckoldry rates in the socially monogamous cichlid fish Variabilichromis moorii	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Mating patterns in animal populations can respond to environmental conditions and consequently vary across time. To examine this variation in nature, studies must include temporal replicates from the same population. Here, we report temporal variation in genetic parentage in the socially monogamous cichlid Variabilichromis moorii from Lake Tanganyika, using samples of broods and their brood-tending parents that were collected across five field trips from the same study population. The sampled broods were either spawned during the dry season (three field trips) or during the rainy season (two trips). In all seasons, we detected substantial rates of extra-pair paternity, which were ascribed to cuckoldry by bachelor males. Paternity shares of brood-tending males were consistently higher, and the numbers of sires per brood were consistently lower, in broods that were spawned in the dry seasons compared to broods from the rainy seasons. In contrast, the strength of size-assortative pairing in our V. moorii population did not vary temporally. Seasonal fluctuations in environmental conditions, such as water turbidity, are proposed as a mechanism behind variable cuckolder pressure. Our data demonstrate the utility of long-term monitoring to improve our understanding of animal mating patterns.

Successional Changes in the Microbial Community of the Alkaline Lake Khilganta during the Dry Season	MICROBIOLOGY												Microbial processes in a shallow, saline, alkaline Lake Khilganta (Southern Siberia) were studied during the dry season. During the drought, a crust was formed on the lake surface, where low rates of production processes were observed, with predominance of anoxygenic photosynthesis at 2.3 mg C/(dm(3) day). The rates of microbial processes increased after short-term rains. During this period, a thin cyanobacterial mat was formed on the bottom, in which filamentous cyanbacteria Geitlerinema spp. predominated and the rate of oxygenic photosynthesis was up to 18 mg C/(dm(3) day). Subsequent water evaporation and salinity increase resulted in altered community types and their activity. Red spots emerged on the mat surface, where anoxygenic prototrophic members of the genus Ectothiorhodospira predominated. Anoxygenic photosynthesis became the main production process in microbial mats, with the rate of 60 mg C/(dm(3) day). At salinity increase to 200 g/L, the water remained in small depressions on the bottom, where extremophilic green algae Dunaliella sp. predominated, and the rate of oxygenic photosynthesis was 0.877 mg C/(dm(3) day). These changes in the type and activity of microbial communities is an example of succession of microbial communities in Southern Siberia saline lakes during drought.

J	Valtonen, ET; Gibson, DI				Valtonen, ET; Gibson, DI			Aspects of the biology of diplostomid metacercarial (Digenea) populations occurring in fishes in different localities of northern Finland	ANNALES ZOOLOGICI FENNICI												Diplostomid metacercariae were found at a high prevalence and in large numbers in the eyes of a wide variety of fish species from widely differing freshwater and brackish water environments in northern Finland. These parasites were found to infect the following: 21 of 25 fish species, some of which were marine, studied in the oligohaline, brackish waters of the Bothnian Bay, Baltic Sea; all nine fish species studied from a large, oligotrophic lake in NE Finland (Yli-Kitka); and all five studied fish species in a small, hypereutrophic lake (Kuivasjarvi). Diplostomids in the lens of the fishes of the Bothnian Bay, studied during two periods extending over seven years, suggest the presence of a stable and predictable system, despite the extremely narrow transmission window between the first (snail) and second (fish) intermediate hosts. Diplostomids in the lens of fishes from the Bothnian Bay and Lake Kuivasjarvi predominated (> 50% infection in 14 of 21 species) over those from the vitreous body of the eye in most cases, but were much lower (< 18%) in Lake Yli-Kitka. The situation in the vitreous body was quite the reverse, since diplostomids in this site predominated over those in the lens in fishes of Lake Yli-Kitka (> 80% prevalences in five of nine fish species). This difference is considered to be dependent on differences in the piscivorous bird fauna. The fact that diplostomid metacercariae accumulated in the fish, together with the lack of any real seasonal variation, confirms the longevity of these larvae in their fish intermediate hosts. Thus metacercariae form a reservoir which is mainly responsible for the maintenance of diplostomid suprapopulations in these northern latitudes.

And its ecological impact is yet to be revealed. This study selected soil bacterial community structure (BCS) as an indicator of ecological restoration to explore the ecological impact of PER project on DL wetland. Soil samples were collected from reed area (RA, where poplar had never been planted, as the end point of ecological restoration for comparison in this study), poplar planting area (PA), poplar retreat for 1-year area (PR1A) and poplar retreat for 2 years area (PR2A), then their soil properties and BCS were measured. The results showed that the PER project caused significant changes in soil properties, such as the soil organic matter (SOM) and moisture, and an increase in the diversity and richness index of soil BCS. The Shannon-wiener index of RA, PA, PR1A and PR2A were 3.3, 2.63, 2.75 and 2.87, respectively. The number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) changed similarly to the Shannon-wiener index. The Pearson correlation analysis and redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that the poplar retreat time, SOM and moisture content were the main factors leading to the increase of BCS diversity. All of these indicated that after the implementation of the PER project, the ecology of the lake area showed a trend of gradual recovery.

The total number of bacteria was measured by DAPI while bacterial community structures were estimated with fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) using oligonucleotide probes specific to ribosomal RNA of the domain Bacteria; the alpha, beta and gamma subclasses of the Class Proteobacteria; the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium group; the Order Planktomycetales; and the Domain Archaea. Denitrification was detected only where anoxia or low concentrations of dissolved oxygen were observed. Maximum in situ denitrification integrated in the water column ranged from 1.36 to 3.79 mmol-N2O m(-2) day(-1) in the rainy season and in the dry season, respectively, both at Station 1, the upstream portion of Barra Bonita Reservoir influenced by the sewage carried out by the river from Sao Paulo City. Bacterioplankton community analysis by FISH showed that the Alpha subclass of the class Proteobacteria was the main subgroup in the middle and low Tiete River (Fig. 3), represented by 10.3-19.2% of total, followed by the Beta Subclass of Proteobacteria and the Cytophaga/Flavobacterium group, represented by 8.3-13.3% and 3.4-10.9%, respectively). This result differs from the proportion of bacterial subgroups in water bodies of temperate regions, suggesting that bacterial communities of water bodies of the tropical region may differ from those of temperate regions.

The management of sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka in Bear Lake, Alaska, is based on the presumption that there are two. genetically isolated seasonal runs that exhibit a bimodal escapement pattern. We investigated the genetic composition and life history of the putative early and late runs in two consecutive years. Significant allele frequency differences at six microsatellite loci demonstrate restricted gene flow between the early and late runs (F-ST = 0.017). There were also significant, and presumably adaptive, differences between the runs with respect to body weight, somatic weight, ovary weight, and egg size among females after correction to equal body sizes. Further, scale pattern analysis revealed highly significant differences in the growth-at-age patterns of these runs. These results demonstrate that there are significant genetic differences between seasonal runs of sockeye salmon and provide support for the management strategy that has been employed for nearly 20 years to protect the genetic diversity of this species in Bear Lake.

Sensitivity analysis of a lake sturgeon population with early life stage density-dependent effects	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) exhibit a complex life-history strategy where behaviour, including habitat selection, depends on ontogenetic stage. Protection or recovery efforts for one stage may not impact other stages. Stage-structured models have been used to explore the sensitivity of the population to changes in vital rates of individual stages. Recent research demonstrates that juvenile mortality may be lower than estimated in prior modelling efforts and density-dependent. We constructed a Lefkovitch matrix model to reflect an updated understanding of the prerecruitment stages of the lake sturgeon. We then compared the model to a population of lake sturgeon on the Ontario-Minnesota border. Our model predicts that population growth rate, time to equilibrium, and final population size were most sensitive to changes to the survival of early adults, followed by subadults and juveniles. Sensitivity to changes in age-0 survival was very low in contrast to earlier modelling efforts, while sensitivities to juvenile (ages 1-7 years) and subadult (ages 8-23 years) were higher than previously reported values.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				NOV	2022	79	11					1992	2005		10.1139/cjfas-2021-0339	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2021-0339		OCT 2022											WOS:000872551200001

No differences were found in the diet of sympatrically-breeding Caspian and Herring Gulls (L. argentatus) that consisted mainly of fish: 57-82% of discarded food items and 71-94% of prey items detected in pellets were fish. The fish diet consisted of 6-14 species, depending on locality. At the gravel pit and at the river where fish ponds were located near the breeding colonies, Carp (Cyprinus carpio) was the dominant fish species in the diet, whereas at the reservoir, Roach (Rutilus rutilus) predominated. The size of fish caught by these gulls was relatively similar at all sites, median length being 14.8 cm at the river, 15.6 cm at the gravel pit and 17.0 cm at the reservoir. The proportion of species but not the size of fish differed significantly between egg-laying/incubation and chick-rearing periods at the gravel pit. These results highlight the importance of fish food for large gulls during the breeding season in recently-colonized inland habitats. We suggest that easily accessible foraging areas, such as fish ponds, crucially affect the food composition of these gulls. Such food opportunism could favor rapid colonization of inland habitats.					; Bukacińska, Monika/AAE-9629-2020; Betleja, Jacek/Q-9309-2016; Chylarecki, Przemysław/B-7696-2013; Bukacinski, Dariusz/KUF-0882-2024	Betleja, Jacek/0000-0001-8186-3411; Zagalska-Neubauer, Magdalena/0000-0002-9738-1393; Chylarecki, Przemyslaw/0000-0001-6863-4294; Bukacinska, Monika/0000-0002-4526-3141; Neubauer, Grzegorz/0000-0003-2123-0780; Bukacinski, Dariusz/0000-0003-0163-2950													0030-5685						2011	88	2					80	89																WOS:000291964800003
J	Harris, W				Harris, Willie			Mineral Distribution and Weathering in the Greater Everglades: Implications for Restoration	CRITICAL REVIEWS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The Greater Everglades encompasses two regions of mineralogical contrastthe Lake Okeechobee Basin (LOB) and the region south of the lake that includes the Everglades and Florida Bay. Lake Okeechobee is a transition zone with mineralogical similarities to both regions. Weathering in the LOB is mainly unidirectional and flow driven, whereas in the Everglades it tends to be cyclical and driven by diurnal and seasonal biogeochemical gradients. LOB soils formed in quartz-dominated marine sediments of various ages under diverse landscape, hydrology, vegetation, and weathering intensities. Calcite and quartz are dominant south of the lake, with quartz diminishing southward. Secondary calcite forms via algal photosynthesis to become a major constituent of marl soils and periphyton. Phosphorus immobilized via periphyton formation is mainly in microbial biomass, but calcite is essential to the process. Minerals of lesser abundance can have disproportionate ecological influence. These include phyllosilicates, oxides, sulfates, sulfides, and phosphates, which have roles in turbidity and biogeochemical processes affecting the fate of P, Hg, and possibly As. Mineral-related perturbations of ecological impact include inhibited precipitation of calcite in periphyton mats, enhanced Hg methylation via sulfide formation from agricultural sulfate, and entrainment of readily-suspended minerals via construction of canals. The nature and rate of Ca-P interactions bear on the rate of ecological recovery. Understanding the dynamics of mineral redistributions is critical for effective restoration.																			1064-3389	1547-6537					2011	41			1			4	27	PII 933741849	10.1080/10643389.2010.531191	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10643389.2010.531191													WOS:000287494000002

Three focal areas of elephants were discovered in the region stretching from Ngombe down to the region of Malebo. Due to insufficient data, only relative abundances were calculated and varied among these three different locations: 0.03 dung-piles/km (Ngombe-Lake Tumba), 0.04 dungpiles/km (Mbanzi-Malebo) and 0.33 dung-piles/km (Lukolela). Elephant trails in the Malebo-Mbanzi area were traversed 0.52 passages/day, within the range [0.50-3.0], indicating a permanent presence of elephants in the zone. Dung-piles in the dry and rainy seasons yielded an overall mean dung lifespan of mu = 109 days within the range [42-182] and seasonal mean lifespan mu = 127.6 days within [70-182] and mu = 87.33 days within [42-126] respectively. Dung-pile heights decreased following the equations y = -4.8818lnx + 16.278 and y = 26.025e (-0.3734+x) respectively. Seed counts on elephant dung-piles indicated that Dysplasia dewevrei, Klainedoxa gabonensis, Treculia africana and Anonidium mannii constituted ca 70% of seeds found in elephant dung-piles. Elephant movements were suspected by the layout of trails but their confirmation would need a more detailed study.

Trin. ex Steud.) on the species composition, richness and abundance of epiphytic midges (Diptera: Chironomidae) was studied in five shallow lakes of eastern Poland during three seasons (May, July and October) of 2001. The lakes represented three states: clear (macrophyte dominated), intermediate (phytoplankton-macrophyte dominated) and turbid (phytoplankton dominated). The trophic status of lake strongly affected the assemblages of chironomids living on the surfaces of common reed. Habitat conditions regulated mostly densities and relative abundance of midge taxa and did not have any significant influence on the number of taxa. The Canonical Correspondence Analysis of epiphytic fauna showed the significance of 5 environmental variables: Secchi disc visibility, dissolved oxygen, reed density, concentration of total phosphorous and epiphytic chlorophyll-a. The analysis separated epiphytic midges into two groups. The first group included taxa limited by low oxygen content and water transparency and corresponds with clear state habitats. To the second group belong taxa typical of eutrophic waters with densities determined by the concentrations of total phosphorous and chlorophyll-a, common in lakes of intermediate state and in particular of turbid state.					; Tarkowska-Kukuryk, Monika/T-7469-2018	Tarkowska-Kukuryk, Monika/0000-0001-5328-6944; 													1505-2249						2011	59	1					141	151																WOS:000288927700013

Vertical and temporal (small timescale) biomass distributions of Potamogeton perfoliatus and Myriophyllum spicatum were analysed in relation to their photosynthetic capacities to understand their coexistence, general presence over the northern shore of the lake seasonal shift of dominance within the community. Our results indicated the adaptation of these macrophytes to the rapidly changing and mostly low irradiance of the Lake Balaton originated from its high turbidity: both P. perfoliatus and M. spicatum had high photosynthetic activity (20 to 50 mg O(2).g drw(-1). h(-1)), low dark respiration (around 12-14% of maximal photosynthetic capacity) and high shade tolerance (I(c) of plants were 29 +/- 18 and 26 +/- 18 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1), respectively). The majority of photosynthetic parameters had no (or little) seasonal changes. On the other hand, in Lake Balaton P. perfoliatus and M. spicatum differed in vertical distribution of biomass: Myriophyllum concentrated its biomass in the upper, well-lit region of the water more strongly than the Potamogeton. Results suggest that the autogenic shift of dominance from Potamogeton to Myriophyllum in Lake Balaton can't be explained only by seasonal patterns of photophysiological changes, but supported by constitutive differences in plants architecture could led to the described phenomena.					; Tóth, Viktor/MFZ-7583-2025	Toth, Viktor/0000-0002-6182-2759; 													0003-4088					JAN	2011	47	2					141	150		10.1051/limn/2011002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/2011002													WOS:000292876800004
J	Haugen, TO				Haugen, TO			Growth and survival effects on maturation pattern in populations of grayling with recent common ancestors	OIKOS												Mortality and growth rates were shown to influence maturation patterns in five populations of grayling (Thymallus thymallus) in central Norway. The populations share recent common ancestors as they derive from introductions performed in 1910, and they inhabit lakes with different environmental conditions (i.e. length of growth season, lake area and fishing pressure). Mortality rate (range of Z-values: 0.36-0.77) and growth pattern varied strongly among the populations. Mortality rates were negatively associated with papulation mean age at maturity (r(sp) = - 0.90), supporting life-history theory which predicts early maturation to be favoured under conditions with high adult mortalities. Maturation reaction norms differed significantly among the populations. Individuals From one population showed no maturation plasticity (all individuals matured at age three), whereas rapid growers were found to mature earlier than slow growers in the remaining four populations. Life-history theory is again supported as it predicts rapid growers to mature early due to high age-specific fecundity and short generation times. Given low mortality risks, slow growers are predicted to delay maturation in order to gain high first-time fecundity. In high-mortality systems all individuals are predicted to mature early. This theory is supported by the present data as populationwise maturation plasticity increased with decreasing mortality rates. In the population with no maturation plasticity the corresponding high mortality rates were probably due to high fishing pressures.

Contrary to this global trend, Wax Lake Delta (WLD), Louisiana, USA recently formed (-1952) and is prograding as sediments delivered by a Mississippi River diversion accumulate at the coastal margin. The scientific community has debated about the degree to which deltas build through large-scale flood events, versus more regular seasonal flooding. Here, we use WLD as a natural laboratory to investigate the relative contributions to deltaic land growth of sediments delivered by large-scale flood events compared to sediments delivered during lesser river flows. We collected six sediment cores from a representative island in WLD and measured the stratigraphic distribution of excess 210Pb (i.e. 210PbTotal - 226Ra). Our data showed alternating layers of sediments with and without excess 210Pb. We attributed the deposition of sediments without excess 210Pb to large-scale flood events and the deposition of sediments with excess 210Pb to lesser river flows. With this approach, we found that 53% of the island-top sediments in WLD were deposited by large-scale flood events and 47% of the sediments were deposited during lesser river flows. Our results show that excess 210Pb has the potential to be a useful indicator of sedimentation mode on active delta surfaces and our results quantify the relative contribution of large-scale flood events to land growth and maintenance on a prograding delta.					; Bianchi, Thomas/L-4060-2014; Mohrig, David/O-1758-2013	Shields, Michael/0000-0002-6194-2689; Kenney, William/0000-0002-2273-8263; Mohrig, David/0000-0003-1828-4526													0025-3227	1872-6151				NOV	2022	453								106914	10.1016/j.margeo.2022.106914	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.margeo.2022.106914		OCT 2022											WOS:000926090500002

An increment was formed annually in the lapillar otoliths, with the formation of annuli occurring between May and August, and peaking in June. Fish spawned from April to October, with a peak period between May and June. The radius of the first annulus varied apparently among individuals, reflecting differences in the duration of the growth period prior to annulus formation owing to extended spawning seasons. Three types of first annulus observed could reflect differences in the periods when the fish were born. The age of sampled fish ranged from 0 to 4 years, among which 1- and 2-year age classes predominated. The mean standard length (SL) at age and growth rate of this population did not differ significantly from those of other native populations. Analysis of life history traits indicated no obvious correlation with either latitude or habitat, whereas SL distribution and age composition were found to vary along a latitudinal gradient. Furthermore, mean SL at age and growth rate showed differences between native and invasive populations. Relatively stable life history traits of this species may explain its dominant status in diverse ecosystems, with plasticity in terms of body size and growth contributing to its successful invasion of different habitats.

J	Dodson, JR; Ramrath, A				Dodson, JR; Ramrath, A			An Upper Pliocene lacustrine environmental record from south-Western Australia - preliminary results	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												A crater created by a supposed meteor impact and located about 30.5 degreesS latitude in Western Australia contains a well-preserved lake sequence of the Upper Pliocene age. This paper reports on the palaeomagnetic record, sediment patterns and selected chemical analyses, and alludes to some of the preliminary results from pollen, charcoal and diatom analyses. The chemical analyses indicate that the lake varied in water depth and that salinity and diatom production were related to climate change rather than changes in major nutrients. The palynological analysis, for the upper 20 m of sediment, shows a woodland and heath similar to today, interspersed with some chenopod shrub land phases, and minor elements include Nothofagus, Araucaria and Phyllocladus which are known from other Tertiary records from southern Western Australia. Charcoal is abundant in the record indicating that fire was a major environmental feature, long before Aboriginal people inhabited the continent. The palaeomagnetic record shows a good match with the Gaussian chron and includes the Kaena and Mammoth subchrons; and these were used as a basis for developing an age-depth model for the sequence. The sediment was subdivided into an upper unit of four lithozones and a lower unit. The upper unit, that dates from ca. 2.5 to 3.51 Ma was interpreted to have formed under a generally wetter climate than today, and with some relatively short intervals of semi-arid climate identified around 2.56 and 2.59 Ma. They were interpreted from episodes of chenopod shrub land that were associated with assemblages of saline habitat diatoms and carbonate and gypsum in the sediments. The sediment profile also included sections of laminated sediments which indicate that around 2.82, 2.86 and 2.96 Ma the climate was more variable and possibly seasonal compared to the rest of the record. These data indicate that the last million years of the Pliocene for south-western Australia endured several episodes of climate variability, thus lending support to the idea that the Pliocene was not a period of a uniform cooling trend gradually leading into the Quaternary glacial episodes.

The water column of this meromictic lake is highly stratified and contains distinctive oxic, suboxic, and anoxic layers. Changes in the redox state of the water column with depth affect the distribution of all the elements studied. Most noticeable are increases in dissolved Co, Cr, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn concentrations across the oxic-suboxic boundary, increases in dissolved As, Co, Cr, Fe, Mn, and V concentrations with depth in the anoxic layer, significant decreases in dissolved Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn concentrations in the anoxic region below the sulfide maximum, and large increases in acid soluble particulate concentrations of As, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mo, Ni, Pb, V, and Zn in the anoxic zone below the sulfide maximum. Thermodynamic calculations for the anoxic region indicate that all redox sensitive elements exist in their reduced forms, the primary dissolved forms of Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn are metal sulfide solution complexes, and solid sulfide phases of Cu, Fe, Mo, and Pb are supersaturated. Calculations using a vertical diffusion and reaction model indicate that the oxidation rate constant for Mn(II) in Hall Lake is estimated to be 0.006 d(-1) and is at the lower end of the range of microbial oxidation rates observed in other natural systems. The main geochemical processes influencing the distribution and speciation of trace elements in Hall Lake appear to be transformations of dissolved elements between their oxidation states (As, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, V), cocycling of trace elements with Mn and Fe (As, Co, Cr, Cu, Mo, Ni, Pb, V, Zn), formation of soluble metal sulfide complexes (Co, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn), sorption (As, Co, Cr, Ni, V), and precipitation (Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Pb, Zn).					; , James Murray/HCI-3547-2022	Murray, James/0000-0002-8577-7964; 													0016-7037					OCT	1994	58	19					3993	4008		10.1016/0016-7037(94)90262-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(94)90262-3													WOS:A1994PK70000003

The Elephant Marsh, Malawi - Part 2: two-dimensional hydrodynamic modelling in support of an eco-social assessment	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												The Elephant Marsh lies on the floodplain of the lower Shire River, in southern Malawi. It is both a cultivated, seasonal floodplain and a wetland, characterised by a complex mosaic of meandering channels, marshland and shallow lakes. In 2016, the Marsh was granted RAMSAR status based on a series of supporting studies, including the modelling of eco-social options for managing its ecological condition. This paper describes two-dimensional (2-D) hydrodynamic modelling using RMA2, in support of this eco-social assessment. The hydraulic model was parameterised using mostly existing data but augmented with bathymetric channel and lake surveys. Calibration and verification used water level data from the hydrometric network for the period 1999 to 2009. Generally, observed water level time-series are well replicated in the model, but there are large discrepancies prior to this period. These are due to temporal changes in hydraulic controls, mainly sedimentation, but also breaching of an embankment at the downstream end of the Marsh. Selected hydraulic-habitat variables (based on daily hydrological time-series 1976 to 2009) provide the indictors of hydrological and hydraulic change used to inform a DRIFT eco-social assessment. The Marsh displays moderate flood attenuation characteristics, but the importance of this will likely increase under continued sedimentation and predicted climate futures, which include more severe storms. The 2-D modelling contributes to an improved understanding of the Marsh's hydraulic behaviour, particularly regarding anthropogenic influences since the early 1900s.																			1608-5914	1727-9364				OCT 14	2022	47	3			SI		386	404		10.2989/16085914.2022.2124228	http://dx.doi.org/10.2989/16085914.2022.2124228		OCT 2022											WOS:000865036500001

Altitudinal and seasonal differences of tick communities in dogs from pastoralist tribes of Northern Kenya	VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY												Studies regarding the distribution and ecology of ticks in dogs from Eastern Africa are scarce. Our research was based on a long-term screening of ticks parasitising the domestic dogs living with indigenous people around Lake Turkana, Mt. Kulal and Mt. Nyiru areas, Northern Kenya. A total of 9977 ticks were collected from 1464 dogs of all ages and both sexes. Identification was performed using morphological keys and data were analyzed using the Repeated Measures ANOVA, post-hoc Scheffe test and F test, relating independent variables as seasons and regions. Final results were translated to maps using GIS software. Five species of ticks were identified: Rhipicephalus pulchellus, Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato (s.l), Rhipicephalus armatus, Amblyomma gemma and Hyalomma truncatum. Our results suggest a statistical difference of the tick community structure related to seasonal and altitudinal distribution. Parasitism with R. armatus and R. pulchellus was higher in September-October than in January, whereas, R. sanguineus s.l. was not influenced by the season. Rhipicephalus armatus was present exclusively on dogs living in semi-desert areas, while R. sanguineus s.l. was the dominant species present on the shores of Lake Turkana. Although R. pulchellus was present in the all studied areas, this species had a significantly higher abundance in the afromontane region of Mt. Kulal and montane xeromorphic forest of Mt. Nyiru; these regions are characterized by elevated humidity and cooler climate. Similar geo-climatic distribution is typical also for A. gemma, which was found in dogs exclusively in Mt. Kulal afromontane area. The current work represents the most extensive study performed on the tick community structure of dogs in Eastern Africa. The results showed a relatively limited tick species diversity, with clear seasonal differences and altitudinal distribution. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A characterization of non-biotic environmental features of prairies hosting the Dakota Skipper (Hesperia dacotae, hesperiidae) across its remaining US range	JOURNAL OF THE LEPIDOPTERISTS SOCIETY												Within the United States, the Dakota Skipper now occurs only in Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota. In these states it has been associated with margins of glacial lakes and calcareous mesic prairies that host warm-season native grasses. Preliminary geographic information system (GIS) analysis in North Dakota has indicated a close congruency between historic distribution of the Dakota Skipper and that of specific near-shore glacial lake features and related soil associations. This study analyzed humidity-related non-biotic microbabitat characteristics within three remaining occupied Dakota Skipper sites in each state during the larval growth period in 2000. Measured parameters included topographic relief, soil compaction, soil pH, moisture, and temperature at various depths, soil bulk density, soil texture, and temperature and humidity within the larval nest zone. Results of these efforts reveal two distinctive habitat substrates, one of relatively low surface relief with dense but relatively less compact soils, and another of relatively high relief with less dense but more compact soils. In the low-relief habitat, grazing appears to Compact soils unfavorably in otherwise similar prairies in the more xeric western portion of the range, potentially by affecting ground-water buffering of larval nest zone humidity.																			0024-0966					MAY 6	2008	62	1					1	17																WOS:000257164000001

In the Lerma River basin, half of the localities that once supported fish communities either no longer have water or are so polluted that fish cannot survive. Of 44 native fishes, 3 are now extinct, and 23 are greatly reduced in range or abundance. In Lake Chapala, total fisheries production has actually increased despite major declines in water quantity and quality, but the fisheries for several valuable native species have declined or collapsed, and exotics now constitute a substantial portion of the catch. In the Ayuquila River, several species have been locally extirpated, and major untreated industrial and municipal discharges, coupled with substantial water withdrawals for irrigation, preclude fish life during the dry season in 20 km of river that once supported an important subsistence fishery. Conservation priorities include protecting localities that still retain native fish assemblages, reducing water withdrawals and pollution discharges, and controlling fishing effort and harvest better. These efforts in west-central Mexico would benefit from increased collaboration among Mexican, U.S., and Canadian fisheries professionals.

During the period 1972 through 1993, annual averages have ranged from 1,223 to 2,311 mg C m(-2) d(-1) for primary production, from 127 to 246 mg m(-2) for chlorophyll, and from 39.3 to 98.5 g m(-2) for algal wet weight. The annual peak of these parameters was in April-May. Over 22 yr, variability in primary productivity was more closely related to changes in chlorophyll than to changes in algal biomass. No evidence was found for consistently increasing long-term trends in primary production, chlorophyll concentrations, or algal wet weight biomass from 1972-1993. Although the annual and semiannual averages of algal biomass were significantly higher in the past 11 yr than those in the previous decade, this pattern could arise from a long-term cyclical but self-compensating trend. The extended record indicates that despite population growth and intense economic development around the lake and in its catchment area, there has been no extreme eutrophication of Lake Kinneret from 1972 to 1993. We suggest that this relative resiliency of the Kinneret ecosystem is due to high ambient levels of alkalinity, calcium, and pH in the lake water acting to limit phosphorus availability, which in turn restricts the outgrowth of phytoplankton.

J	Lamoureux, SF; Bradley, RS				Lamoureux, SF; Bradley, RS			A late Holocene varved sediment record of environmental change from northern Ellesmere Island, Canada	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												A composite record of varve sedimentation is presented from high arctic meromictic Lake C2. The combination of a short runoff and sediment transport season with the strong density stratification of the lake lead to the formation of annual sediment couplers. This conclusion was confirmed by Pb-210 determinations. High intra-lake correlation of the varves allowed the construction of a composite record of varve sedimentation from overlapping segments of multiple sediment cores. Cross-dating between core segments isolated counting errors in individual cores, that could be attributed to minor sediment disturbances and vague structures. Resolving counting errors by cross-dating reduced the chronological error of the composite series to an estimated +/-57 years. The Lake C2 series is the first non-ice cap, high resolution late-Holocene environmental record from the Canadian high arctic. The composite varve series compares favorably with other high resolution proxies from the arctic, in particular with the ice core records from Devon Island and Camp Century, Greenland. A general correspondence between the varve record and other North American proxies for the little Ice Age period (1400-1900 AD) suggests that the Lake C2 record is sensitive to large-scale synoptic changes.

Geospatial assessment of seasonal water quality of Malad creek, Mumbai, India: An impact of sewage discharge	INDIAN JOURNAL OF GEO-MARINE SCIENCES												Water pollution of creeks and the marine environment is a serious concern across the globe due to rapid urbanization and industrialization. Mumbai, being a densely populated industrial hub of India is facing the impact of sewage pollution in creeks and coastal belts. In this study, one of the polluted creeks of Mumbai namely Malad creek is considered a study area to assess the seasonal variation of sewage pollution with special attention to satellite image analysis and tidal characteristics. For this, in-situ sampling corresponding with the date and time pass of satellite images and spectral analysis are carried out to assess spatio-temporal variation in the water quality of the creek as well as establish a statistical relationship between image analysis and ground data. The purpose of this study is to avoid the limitations of monitoring point-specific data, inaccessible remote areas, labour intensiveness, higher expense, and unavailability of temporal data in the conventional method. The study provides an adequate, effective, and comprehensive way to assess sewage pollution in waterbodies and suggests future research work like the health assessment of marine organisms and threats in eco-sensitive zones of the coastal environment.																				2582-6727				OCT	2022	51	10					811	821		10.56042/ijms.v51i10.2930	http://dx.doi.org/10.56042/ijms.v51i10.2930													WOS:001025412100002

Optical methods are widely used to monitor the concentrations of chlorophylls in algae or cyanobacteria in aqueous ecosystems, but they have very limited application in monitoring the bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) concentration in phototrophic bacteria. The paper describes comprehensively three new methods of quantitative analysis of the photosynthetic pigment of BChl d of green sulfur bacteria using spectral measurements in both initial samples of natural water (absorption spectra), and in pigment extracts in organic solvents (absorption and fluorescence spectra). A comparative analysis of the results from different methods is carried out using, as an example, natural water from the chemocline region in Lake Trekhtzvetnoe, one of the meromictic water bodies in the Kandalaksha Bay in the White Sea. Conclusions are drawn about the applicability conditions of different methods, their advantages and limitations. All three methods suggested have been proven to be efficient using, as an example, samples of natural water with BChl concentrations differing by orders of magnitude, from 5 to 5000 mg/m(3).

Berry			Stable isotope evidence for the biogeochemical transformation of ancient organic matter beneath Suess Glacier, Antarctica	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Glaciers overrun organic matter (OM) during periods of advance, making this overrun OM available as a metabolic substrate for subglacial microbes. The biogeochemical fate of this overrun OM remains poorly understood, ultimately limiting our understanding of subglacial biogeochemical cycling, particularly for cold-based glaciers. This study presents evidence for the biogeochemical transformation of algal mat material that was overrun by a cold-based glacier (Suess Glacier, Taylor Valley, Antarctica) during its advance 4840-3570 years BP. We use a suite of stable isotope analyses to show that active nitrogen cycling has depleted N-isotope values to amongst the lowest reported in Taylor Valley (-15.59 parts per thousand) from an initial value of similar to-1.88 parts per thousand, while potentially depleting C-isotope values by 2.46 parts per thousand. While this study examines biogeochemical conditions beneath a single glacier, all glaciers export meltwater during the melt season that may host algae and other OM in proglacial streams and lakes that may be overridden during glacier advance. As such, subglacial nitrogen cycling detected here may represent processes that occur in cold zones beneath glaciers generally.

J	Wurster, FC; Cooper, DJ; Sanford, WE				Wurster, FC; Cooper, DJ; Sanford, WE			Stream/aquifer interactions at Great Sand Dunes National Monument, Colorado: influences on interdunal wetland disappearance	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Between 1937 and 1995 a complex of more than 100 interdunal wetlands disappeared from Great Sand Dunes National Monument, Colorado. We investigated three hypotheses that could explain Welland disappearance: (1) dune movement during a severe drought in the 1950s buried the wetlands, (2) agriculture related ground water pumping lowered the regional water table, and (3) changes in local hydrologic processes led to wetland loss. We used regional stream flow records, ground water level measurements, natural stable isotope analyses, soil stratigraphy, buried seed banks, and ground water modeling to address these hypotheses. Hydrologic data and stable isotope analyses illustrated the interaction between Sand Creek, a nearby stream, and the unconfined aquifer in the area where wetlands occurred. When the intermittent Sand Creek flows, seepage through its bed creates a large ground water mound under the creek. The seasonal development and dispersion of this mound propagates pressure waves through the aquifer that influence ground water levels up to 2 km from Sand Creek. Our data suggest the primary factors contributing to wetland disappearance were recent climatic fluctuations and incision of the Sand Creek channel. Below average stream flow between 1950 and 1980 reduced the duration of Sand Creek flow across the dune complex, minimizing ground water mound development. Consequently, the water table in the unconfined aquifer dropped similar to 1.0 m and interdunal wetlands dried up. Twentieth Century incision of Sand Creek's channel reduced ground water mound height similar to 2.5 m, decreasing seasonal water table fluctuations at interdunal wetlands and contributing to the overall water table decline. Longterm wet and dry cycles affect the water table elevation more than channel incision, leading us to conclude that many interdunal wetlands are ephemeral features. Wetland area is maximized during consecutive years of above average Sand Creek discharge and minimized as the water table drops during dry periods. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Thiollay, JM				Thiollay, JM			Long-term changes of raptor populations in northern Cameroon	JOURNAL OF RAPTOR RESEARCH												Comparative mid-dry-season counts of diurnal raptors (42 species) were performed in similar conditions along nine road transects (total=1359 km) in 1973 and 2000 in representative areas of northern Cameroon to assess changes in abundance of species over the last three decades. The transects covered Sudanian and southern Sahelian woodlands, savannas, cultivated areas, and wetlands. Additionally, in 2000, three protected woodlands and one new artificial wetland were censused to document the raptor community of these habitats. All four broad categories of raptors (vultures, other resident species, Afrotropical, and Palearctic migrants) exhibited a decline in numbers, and only two species increased significantly, against 14 which decreased and 24 which did not show population changes. Overall, vultures declined by 67%, notably the formerly abundant Hooded (Necrosyrtes monachus) and White-backed (Gyps africanus) Vultures and Ruppell's Griffons (Gyps rueppellii). Their decrease was striking in every habitat and area. All large eagles (seven residents and three Palearctic migrants) also decrease significantly (83%). Only the two smaller migratory Wahlberg's (Aquila wahlbergi) and Booted Eagles (Hieraaetus pennatus) remained fairly stable or increased. Nine of the 11 smaller African residents did not change markedly; only the Black-shouldered Kite (Elanus caeruleus) increased three-fold and the Dark Chanting Goshawk (Melierax metabates) decreased significantly (62%). The five medium-size African migrants either decreased or increased, but not significantly, especially when differences in ecological conditions between years were taken into account. Among nice Palearctic migrants, kestrels decreased dramatically, whereas harriers remained at least stable. The new Maga Lake and associated rice fields were decidely poorer in most Palearctic migrants than were the former natural humid grasslands which they replaced. Habitat modification due to the rapidly increasing human pressure explained most changes. However, the collapse of vulture populations cannot be accounted for by these changes or by persecution.																			0892-1016					SEP	2001	35	3					173	186																WOS:000171671400001

The species is categorized on the Red List of Shiga Prefecture as a "Species of Concern", given a suspected population decline in Lake Biwa; however, its spawning ecology in the lake is yet to be fully elucidated. Therefore, in this study, we examined the spawning and migratory behavior of gin-buna crucian carp at a lakeside biotope connected to the lake via egg survey and acoustic telemetry. DNA analyses of field-collected eggs showed that gin-buna spawned in the biotope during March-April in 2019 and 2020. Three gin-buna captured in the biotope were tagged with acoustic transmitters and released into the lake in October 2019, and one individual returned to the biotope in March 2020. These results suggest that some individuals of gin-buna use the biotope as a spawning ground for multiple years.					; Yoshida, Makoto/AAF-5102-2020	Yoshida, Makoto/0000-0003-1702-5493; 													1341-8998	1616-3915				JUL	2023	70	3					386	397		10.1007/s10228-022-00893-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10228-022-00893-y		SEP 2022											WOS:000863153900001
J	Kramer, DB				Kramer, Daniel Boyd			Determinants and efficacy of social capital in lake associations	ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION												The hundreds of lake associations in Minnesota are examples of voluntary collective action organizations. Although these groups are organized for several purposes, their main concern is environmental management and specifically the improvement or preservation of lake water quality. Social capital probably affects organizational effectiveness. Survey and biophysical data were used to examine the determinants and efficacy of social capital in lake associations. Social capital production in lake associations was associated with water quality, lake size, recreational preferences, seasonality of residents, location, information sharing, per caput budget and relations with local government. Social capital also had a significant but small positive relationship with lake water clarity. Natural resource policy makers might consider investments in social capital as part of their strategy portfolio. Although statistical analyses of the role of social capital in local environmental management using large sample sizes are promising, several measurement and methodological difficulties remain.					; Kramer, Daniel/KWT-7108-2024	Kramer, Daniel/0000-0002-1284-4871; 													0376-8929	1469-4387				SEP	2007	34	3					186	194		10.1017/S0376892907004171	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0376892907004171													WOS:000252206400003

In this study, FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation (FAO56-PM), multiple stepwise regression (MLR), and Kohonen self-organising map (K-SOM) techniques were used for the estimation of daily pan evaporation (E-p) in three treatments, where C was the standard class A pan with top water, S was a pan with sediment covered bottom, and SM was class A pan containing submerged macrophytes (Myriophyllum spicatum, Potamogeton perfoliatus, and Najas marina), at Keszthely, Hungary, in a six-season experiment, between 2015 and 2020. The modelling approach included six measured meteorological variables. Average E-p varied from 0.6 to 6.9mmd(-1) for C, 0.7 to 7.9mmd(-1) for S, and from 0.9 to 8.2mmd(-1) for SM during the growing seasons studied. Correlation analysis and K-SOM visual representation revealed that air temperature and global radiation had positive correlation, while relative humidity had a negative correlation with the Ep of C, S, and SM. The results showed that the MLR method provided close compliance (R-2 = 0.58-0.62) with the observed pan evaporation values, but the K-SOM method (R-2 = 0.97-0.98) yielded by far the closest match to observed evaporation estimates for all three pans. To our best knowledge, no similar work has been published previously using the three modelling methods for seeded pan evaporation estimation. The current study differs from previous evaporation estimates by using neural networks even with those pans containing sediments and submerged macrophytes. Their evaporation will be treated directly by K-SOM, in which the modelling is more than the simple E-p of a class A pan filled with clean tap water.

Geochemistry of organic matter by multi-proxy analyses and temperature sensitivity of methanogenesis in clearwater Amazonian lake sediments	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												Despite the relevance of bottom sediments from clearwater floodplain lakes in organic matter preservation and degradation, there is a scarcity of data regarding the composition of molecular biomarkers and responses of benthic methanogenesis in Amazonian lakes in global warming scenarios. Here, surface sediments from a small clearwater floodplain lake (Jacund ' a Lake) in the Brazilian Amazon (Tapaj ' os River) were assessed in a combined approach between molecular biomarker composition and the sensitivity of methanogenesis under two experi-mental temperatures: 25 degrees C as control vs. + 4 degrees C as an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) global warming scenario for 2081-2100. Lipid biomarker composition (n-alkanes, sterols) in a 12-cm sediment core revealed a strong predominance of terrestrial-derived organic matter over aquatic contributions, indicating more refractory preserved organic matter, while aquatic organic matter represents substrates to biological degrada-tion. Moreover, alkanoic acids and microbial triterpenoids indicated an intense microbial contribution and elevated organic matter processing. Compound specific isotopic analysis confirmed the presence of methano-trophic microorganisms (diploptene delta 13C = -53.5 parts per thousand) and an uptake of depleted 13C in aquatic organic matter. Diagenetic transformation of biomarkers also indicated a highly anoxic depositional environment throughout the core. Methanogenesis in the upper 15-cm sediment layer under 25 degrees C (39.3 mg C-CH4 m- 2 d-1) was similar to higher rates reported in Amazonian lakes and increased about 60% in the treatment when the temperature increased by 4 degrees C. Despite the predominant terrestrial sources and subsequent refractory composition of organic matter, our findings integrating biomarkers and metabolic processes support that biomass stocks in clearwater lake sediments of the Amazon basin may be sensitive to global warming.

Functional forecasting of dissolved oxygen in high-frequency vertical lake profiles	ENVIRONMETRICS												Predicting dissolved oxygen (DO) in lakes is important for assessing environmental conditions as well as reducing water treatment costs. High levels of DO often precede toxic algal blooms, and low DO causes carcinogenic metals to precipitate during water treatment. Typically, DO is predicted from limited data sets using hydrodynamic modeling or data-driven approaches like neural networks. However, functional data analysis (FDA) is also an appropriate modeling paradigm for measurements of DO taken vertically through the water column. In this analysis, we build FDA models for a set of profiles measured every 2 hours and forecast the entire DO percent saturation profile from 2 to 24 hours ahead. Functional smoothing and functional principal component analysis are applied first, followed by a vector autoregressive model to forecast the empirical functional principal component (FPC) scores. Rolling training windows adapt to seasonality, and multiple combinations of window sizes, model variables, and parameter specifications are compared using both functional and direct root mean squared error metrics. The FPC method outperforms a suite of comparison models, and including functional pH, temperature, and conductivity variables improves the longer forecasts. Finally, the FDA approach is useful for identifying unusual observations.					; Scott, Thad/AAF-7151-2020	Durell, Luke/0000-0003-4981-9431; 													1180-4009	1099-095X				JUN	2023	34	4							e2765	10.1002/env.2765	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/env.2765		SEP 2022											WOS:000858917400001

Nearshore plankton and macroinvertebrate community structure is strongly associated with macrophyte abundance in a large lake with high shoreline development	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												The nearshore or shoreline-adjacent area in a lake provides essential habitats for aquatic organisms and it is the part of the littoral zone that is most impacted by human activities in the watershed. High land use and shore-line alteration have negative impacts on the nearshore environment, however, the nearshore area is rarely included in lake monitoring programs. To address this major data gap, we arranged to get access to private lake-front proper-ties in Lake Scugog, Ontario, Canada, with the goal of determining how nearshore biological communities (phyto-plankton, zooplankton, macroinvertebrates, and macrophytes) are influenced by local site conditions. Water quality samples and biological communities were collected over two field seasons (2018 and 2019). Redundancy analysis and generalized linear latent variable models showed that the phytoplankton, zooplankton, and macroinvertebrate communities in Lake Scugog had significant associations with macrophyte taxa abundances. Regressions showed that macrophyte abundance at each site significantly influenced phytoplankton, zooplankton, and macroinverte-brate abundance and phytoplankton and macroinvertebrate diversity. Even in lakes with a high degree of shoreline development, when macrophytes are allowed to flourish they can play an important role in supporting nearshore biological community abundance and diversity. Thus, their removal for navigation and aesthetic purposes has im-portant and largely negative implications for the maintenance of overall lake health.

The common carp Cyprinus carpio are known to cause major changes in lentic systems, but may not be solely responsible for large scale changes in these ecosystems. We used data from extensive collection efforts to gain insight into the importance of carp as drivers of ecosystem change in Lake Patzcuaro, Mexico. We compared the structure (fish density, biomass, diversity, and evenness) of fish assemblages from six Lake Patzcuaro sites with different habitat characteristics. Intersite comparisons were carried out for both wet and dry seasons. We explored the relationships between non-carp species and carp; and studied multivariate interactions between fish abundance and habitat characteristics. From a biomass perspective, carp was dominant in only four of six sites. In terms of density, carp was not a dominant species in all sites. Further, carp density and biomass were not negatively related to native species density and biomass, even when carp density and biomass were positively correlated to water turbidity levels. Carp dominated fish assemblages in the shallowest sites with the highest water turbidity, plant detritus at the bottom, and floating macrophytes covering the lake surface. These results suggest that the effect of carp on fish assemblages may be highly dependent on habitat characteristics in Lake Patzcuaro. Watershed degradation, pollution, water level loss, and other sources of anthropogenic influence may be more important drivers of Lake Patzcuaro degradation than the abundance of carp.					; Moncayo-Estrada, Rodrigo/Q-8229-2018; Ramirez, Juan Pablo/ITU-5096-2023; MAR-SILVA, VALENTIN/AAR-4448-2021	Balart, Eduardo F./0000-0001-8752-1017; Moncayo-Estrada, Rodrigo/0000-0003-0204-1482; 													0364-152X	1432-1009				SEP	2015	56	3					603	617		10.1007/s00267-015-0524-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-015-0524-y								25975439					WOS:000359161900003

AN ASSESSMENT OF FISH PREDATION ON THE ZEBRA MUSSEL, DREISSENA POLYMORPHA (PALLAS 1771) AFTER RECENT COLONISATION OF TWO MANAGED BROWN TROUT LAKE FISHERIES IN IRELAND	BIOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENT-PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL IRISH ACADEMY												The zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha, Pallas 1771) invaded Lough Sheelin in the midlands of Ireland in 2001, providing a novel potential food resource for the resident fish species. This paper assesses fish predation on the mussel after the recent colonisation of the lake (with supplementary data from Lough Arrow). In addition, implications for the resident fish community are considered. Roaca (Rutilus rutilus L.), and roach bream hybrids (R. rutilus x Abramis brama L.) were found to consume zebra mussels in all sampling seasons. For other fish species (European perch [Perca fluviavilis L.], northern pike [Esox lucius L.] and the brown trout [Salmo trutta L.]) the occurrence of zebra mussels in the diet was low, in addition to being seasonal, and possibly consumed as incidental by-catch in some cases. The incorporation of mussels into the diet represents the most important change to the feeding habits of cyprinids. Adult roach populations have not increased despite feeding on zebra mussels and appear to be the most negatively impacted fish taxa since the establishment of the mussel in the lake. Brown trout and perch may be advantaged in the long-term, most likely due to reductions in chlorophyll a, habitat changes and altered food resources. The extent of fish predation on zebra mussels does not appear to be sufficient to suppress the mussel population in the lake.

Portage connectivity does not predict establishment success of canoe-mediated dispersal for crustacean zooplankton	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												Although community structure may be largely determined by local abiotic and biotic conditions under moderate levels of dispersal, anthropogenic activities can enhance dispersal rates far beyond what would otherwise occur in natural systems. We investigated the potential impact of recreational canoeing on crustacean zooplankton community structure in Killarney Provincial Park, Canada, where canoes that are transported between lakes via portage routes may enhance zooplankton community connectivity by providing a dispersal "short-cut." We conducted a study to (1) quantify zooplankton attachment to canoe hulls after paddling through a lake and assess the importance of canoes to overall seasonal dispersal within a lake relative to other means of dispersal, (2) test the prediction that zooplankton survivorship is negatively correlated with portage duration using a mesocosm experiment, and (3) test whether variation in lake community composition was better explained by models based on reduced portage-corrected distances or true edge-to-edge distances between lakes along popular canoe routes. Here, we report the findings that canoes have the potential to act as frequent dispersal vectors, but appear to have little impact on community structure in portage-connected lakes. Substantial numbers of adult zooplankton became attached to canoe hulls and were able to establish viable populations even after exposure to portage conditions for 30 min. However, canoe-mediated dispersal only accounted for a very small proportion (< 1% in this case) of overall seasonal dispersal. Moreover, environmental variables explained the greatest amount of variation in community composition among park lakes. Nevertheless, this study indicates that canoe dispersal could be more effective for specific species such as Sida crystallina than is evident by analysis of entire communities and could facilitate the spread of invasive species amenable to attaching to boat hulls. Thus, the debate about whether community composition is more strongly influenced by local environmental conditions or regional dispersal may vary depending on the scale of consideration (i.e., individual species vs. whole community).					; Strecker, Angela/E-9430-2016	Arnott, Shelley/0000-0002-3834-703X; Strecker, Angela/0000-0001-9387-1654													1386-2588	1573-5125				MAR	2012	46	1					9	24		10.1007/s10452-011-9378-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-011-9378-4													WOS:000299842700002

The accelerated flow represents a substantial, through short-lived, change in ice discharge. During the period of rapid motion, meltwater-filled supraglacial lakes may have drained, which could have increased basal water pressure and caused the mini-surge. There are too few velocity measurements on other large outlet glaciers to determine whether this type of event is a widespread phenomenon in Greenland, but because most other outlet glaciers are at lower latitudes, they should experience more extensive melting, making them more susceptible to meltwater-induced surges.

Zooplankton samples were collected through surface horizontal tows by a modified WP2 net (via. mouth diameter 50 cm, length 180 cm, 150 mu m mesh size). Order Calanoida dominated the abundance with mean annual average of 75.29%. We observed abnormal protuberances on copepods, known as tumour-like anomalies (TLAs). Calanoida showed more frequent and prominent TLAs on its dorsal surface with highest mean percentage occurring during Jun. 2012 (1.64%). The percentage prevalence of TLAs on the Copepoda was highest during Jun. 2012 (1.36%) and least during Nov. 2012 (0.03%). It is suggested that these TLAs might be caused due to the presence of potentially high levels of toxic substances, which weakens the exoskeleton and thereby making them more susceptible to infections or due to wounds from parasites or might be related to the occurrence of symbiotic tantulocarids or might be due to the radiation stress as a control measure. Whatever the reason, these TLAs have become a serious emerging threat to the aquatic food web. Our investigation is the first of its kind in the coastal waters of the Saudi Red Sea, which needs further investigations in order to elucidate the possible reasons for these abnormalities.

J	Diodato, N; Esposito, L; Bellocchi, G				Diodato, Nazzareno; Esposito, Libera; Bellocchi, Gianni			A First Regional-Scale Estimate of Climate-Driven Terrestrial Carbon Export in Boreal Catchments	CLIMATE												Highly dynamic hydro-geomorphic processes are known to drive exports of carbon (C) from river basins, but are not yet fully understood. Within this study, we simulated total organic carbon (TOC) exports at the outlet of Lake Simojarvi in the Gulf of Bothnia (Finland) with a parsimonious hydrological model. With thorough consideration of the dependence of erosion and sediment transport processes on seasonal precipitation rates, a satisfactory agreement was obtained between modelling and experimental observations (1962-2005). This provided confidence in the capability of the parsimonious model to represent temporal and spatial export dynamics. In the period 1860-2014, TOC export at the outlet of Lake Simojarvi was estimated to be highest on average (similar to 5.5 Mg km(-2).year(-1)) over 1974-2014 while the lowest TOC export (similar to 2.5 Mg km(-2).year(-1)) was estimated in 1860-1918 (with high levels of interannual-to-multidecadal variation). Regional simulations indicate that TOC increased in recent decades (on average, 4-5 Mg km(-2).year(-1) in 1974-2014 against similar to 3 Mg km(-2).year(-1) in 1940-1973) in northern Scandinavia and Finland. Warming-induced variability of TOC (which depends on precipitation patterns) may have altered the rates of C exchanges in aquatic ecosystems over recent years. TOC exports may continue to increase in boreal catchments with increasing temperatures as represented by future projections.					; esposito, libera/KIB-0552-2024; Diodato, Nazzareno/B-3881-2009	Bellocchi, Gianni/0000-0003-2712-7979; 														2225-1154				JUN	2018	6	2							22	10.3390/cli6020022	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli6020022													WOS:000436491700004

Hydrologic Impact of Urbanization on Catchment and River System Downstream from Taihu Lake	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH					3rd International Conference on Water Resource and Environment (WRE)	JUN 26-29, 2017	Qingdao, PEOPLES R CHINA					This study examined the hydrologic impacts from rapid urbanization of a river valley and associated floodplain. The catchment downstream of the Taihu Lake was selected as the study region. Remote sensing images and topographic data for the period of post-1990 were employed to estimate hydrologic indicators for analyzing evolutionary features of the river system. Time series methods were adopted to analyze the hydrological effects on the watershed and river network resulting from rapid urbanization over the past 20 years. The results demonstrated that: (1) the number, length, and drainage density of rivers decreased from 1991 to 2006. The overall number of rivers decreased by 36.3%, and the overall river length was reduced by 25.5%; (2) the relationship between river length, river number, and stream order showed a geometric series over time, indicating a self-similarity in the river network that persisted even as the network changed due to urbanization; (3) the river network fractal dimension and complexity showed a decreasing trend over time, which indicated a simplification of the river system. In 1991, 2001, and 2006, the river network fractal dimension values were 2.24, 2.12, and 1.9, respectively; (4) excluding the influence of meteorological factors, there were at different levels increases in regional and seasonal precipitation. In addition, the difference in precipitation between urban and suburban areas increased gradually. Water levels also rose when the influence of precipitation was excluded.

The Monsoon leads to an annual increase of the water mass. However, GRACE data also displays the existence of a semi-annual cycle whose its origin is still uncertain. This cycle is characterized by a gain of water mass at the beginning of the dry season. In this study, 10-days GRACE data are used to understand the characteristics of this semi-annual cycle. Investigations of the rainfall events, rivers discharge peaks, and the Lake Chad water level variations suggest that they are not at the origin of this cycle. However, MODIS evapotranspiration data display an increase each 6 months, during the rainy season, and at the same time as the semi-annual cycle estimated by GRACE. This increase occurs in regions where the amount of clays at the surface exceeds 30%. The link between both signals and the proportion of clays at the surface leads us to the conclusion that the seasonal variation of the vertical permeability of clays controls the amount of water present in the unsaturated zone.

EXTRINSIC AND INTRINSIC PREDICTORS OF VARIATION IN INFECTION BY POSTHODIPLOSTOMUM MINIMUM MACCALLUM, 1921 (TREMATODA) IN SUNFISHES (LEPOMIS RAFINESQUE, 1819) FROM EASTERN OHIO	JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY												The trematode Posthodiplostomum minimum MacCallum, 1921 (white grub) is a common parasite of centrarchid fishes, frequently reaching high prevalence and intensity in local populations. However, significant variation in infection has been observed across Lepomis Rafinesque, 1819 sunfish species, which are common and abundant hosts for this parasite. Previous observations suggest both extrinsic factors (e.g., habitat-specific characteristics and environmental parameters) and intrinsic factors (e.g., host size, behavior, and susceptibility) as important predictors of infection in this parasite-host system. In the present study, we evaluated the prevalence and intensity of P. minimum in 6 sympatric species of Lepomis sunfish (total of 563 individuals) across 9 lakes in eastern Ohio, U.S.A., that range in surface area from 5.6 to 1,448.7 hectares, and assessed the importance of both extrinsic and intrinsic factors as predictors of infection. We found that collection site (extrinsic factor) and host body mass and species identity (intrinsic factors) were the strongest predictors of infection intensity. Specifically, infection intensity was negatively associated with lake surface area and positively associated host body mass. Lepomis macrochirus (bluegill sunfish) and hybrid sunfish displayed the highest infection intensities, whereas Lepomis cyanellus (green sunfish) and Lepomis gulosus (warmouth sunfish) were significantly less burdened. We were unable to conclude if the observed variation among host species was due to host ecology or susceptibility. These general findings were supported by classification and regression tree (CART) analysis, which optimally partitioned variation in individual host infection intensities by using lake size and host body mass (but not host species identity). Although infection intensity was negatively associated with lake surface area (even among host individuals of the same size and species), the causal mechanisms involved remain unresolved and should be the impetus of future work on this parasite-host system.																			0022-3395	1937-2345				JUN	2018	104	3					202	209		10.1645/17-131	http://dx.doi.org/10.1645/17-131								29553888					WOS:000435478700003
J	Arst, H; Reinart, A				Arst, Helgi; Reinart, Anu			Application of optical classifications to North European lakes	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												Two classifications (rough and fine) based on the optical properties of water were used to classify 42 Estonian, Finnish, and Swedish lakes. The rough classification was based on the amount of optically active substances (OAS: chlorophyll a, suspended matter, and colored dissolved organic matter) in the water. The basic variables of the fine classification were chlorophyll a concentration, beam attenuation coefficient of light in the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) region in the water (or corresponding Secchi depth), and the beam attenuation coefficient for filtered water at 380 nm. All optical classes were represented in the studied lakes by both classifications, when they changed their class depending on the seasonal and biological conditions. In a large lake, different parts of the lake belonged to different optical classes. The results obtained by both classifications were in good agreement. There was a concurrence between optical classes and water transparency by Secchi depth. Often the bio-optical variations of water properties are described from the measurements of all three OAS and Secchi depth because these parameters belong to routine monitoring datasets and have been carefully recorded. The water classes provide a method to summarize the influences of the different factors.																			1386-2588	1573-5125				DEC	2009	43	4					789	801		10.1007/s10452-008-9225-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-008-9225-4													WOS:000272847400001

Growth, biomass, and production of two small barbs (Barbus humilis and B. tanapelagius, Cyprinidae) and their role in the food web of Lake Tana (Ethiopia)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Growth, biomass and production of two small barbs (Barbus humilis and Barbus tanapelagius) and their role in the food web of Lake Tana were investigated. From length-frequency distribution of trawl monitoring surveys growth coefficient, I broken vertical bar' values were estimated at 3.71-4.17 for B. humilis and 3.70-4.14 for B. tanapelagius, respectively. Values for B. humilis were confirmed in pond experiments. Mean biomass of the small barbs was 13.3 kg fresh wt ha(-1), with B. humilis being most abundant in the littoral and sub-littoral zones, whereas B. tanapelagius was most abundant in the sub-littoral and pelagic zones. The two small barbs had a production of 53 kg fresh wt ha(-1) year(-1). Although their P/B ratios of about 4.0 were relatively high for small cyprinids, both their biomass and production were low in comparison with other small fish taxa in other tropical lakes. Of the zooplankton production only about 29% was consumed by the small barbs. However, they did not utilize calanoid copepods, which were responsible for approximately 57% of the zooplankton production and it is likely that small barb production was food limited during certain periods of the year. Piscivorous labeobarbs consumed about 56% of the small barbs production annually, but additionally, Clarias gariepinus, and many bird species were also preying on them. Therefore, limitation of Barbus production by predation during certain periods in the year cannot be excluded.

Physical, chemical, mineralogical and micromorphological properties were studied in selected soil transects. The soils are eutrophic as result of nutrient cycling, low weathering degree, and presence of primary minerals with nutrient reserves in their composition. The occurrence of well developed eutrophic soils (Oxisols) under caatinga (xeromorphic vegetation) on the flat tops all over the region is evidence of a paleo-weathering under wetter conditions. These Oxisols (P2 and P7 pedons) are kaolinitic and have a microgranular structure, while the Ki index, Fe-o/Fe-d ratio, Fe levels, and micromorphological and submicroscopic features are typical for this soil class. In the clay fraction they also contain gibbsite, illite, and goethite. The presence of illite, the K reserve, and the intergrade character indicate a low degree of weathering, contrasting with other typical Oxisols of more humid areas of Southeastern Brazil. All studied soils are pedogenetically polycyclic, revealing a current acidification trend at the surface, suggesting the occurrence of a more seasonal climate in a recent past. This trend of acidification induces the destabilization and breakdown of expansible 2:1 clays in subsurface and release of structural Mg and Al to more soluble fractions. This causes a Ca:Mg imbalance in B horizon. There is a marked influence of Na and/or Na + Mg on clay dispersion, causing a textural gradient and higher amount of dispersed clay in the soils. The high Na and K exchangeable amounts were ascribed to marine lagoon sprays to the soil surface, besides the Na and K coming from subsurface K-feldspar and Na/Ca plagioclase weathering. Based on the humic substance fractionation, it was observed a trend towards the formation and migration of organic complex such as Na-fulvates and Na-humates in Na-rich solutions, as indicated by a highly significant correlation between exchangeable Na and the fulvic and humic fractions.

It is well known since previously that profundal oligochaete assemblages of large lakes in Europe may be particularly indicative of the current trophic situation, but little has been known about smaller lakes in this respect. Characterizations based on oligochaete community structure in these lakes could be summarized in eight different groups: Characteristic oligochaete communities in oligotrophic lakes of relatively small size are Spirosperma ferox, Stylodrilus heringianus and Tubifex tubifex. Oligochaete species richness is low (1-3 species) and so is species abundance (<300 specimens . m(-2)). Very eutrophic lakes of the same size-range are largely dominated by the tubificids Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri and/or Potamothrix hammoniensis. Substitute or complementary species may be T. tubifex. Species richness is usually low (1-3 species), but abundance is high to very high (>5000 specimens . m(-2)). Mesotrophic to moderately eutrophic lakes of the same size categories contain more species than the above extremes, most of them being fairly tolerant to oxygene deficiency such as Tubifex ignotus, a number of species of the genera Aulodrilus and Limnodrilus and a variety of so-called Ponto-Caspian Potamothrix species, most of them having recently invaded south-eastern Sweden. Species richness is moderate to high (4-8 species), while abundance may vary considerably (range from about 300 to about 5000 specimens . m(-2)). In this respect, small- to middle-size lakes do not differ much from larger lakes. For the trophic characterization of lake water the mean concentrations of total-phosphorus (in mug . l(-1)) is generally regarded to be the most appropriate measure. The match between characterizations based upon oligochaete community structure and total-phosphorus concentrations is generally very good for large lakes. The present study shows that this applies fairly well also to the majority of the small- to middle-size lakes selected for this study. This has not been shown before. Obvious deviations from this rule could be caused by a scarcity of reliable chemical data, or considerable seasonal shifts in the chemical composition ot the water, which in its turn may be caused by short water residence time. Littoral elements in the fauna, which are generally less indicative, or effects of local inflows may also be more frequent here than in lakes of larger size.																			0018-8158					JAN	2002	468	1-3					53	61		10.1023/A:1015274323026	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1015274323026													WOS:000175212000006
J	Yan, XT; Liao, JH; Cao, XX; Han, ZW				Yan, Xinting; Liao, Jiahao; Cao, Xingxing; Han, Zhiwei			Temporal and spatial distribution characteristics and source analysis of dissolved organic nitrogen in the surface sediment of the Caohai Lake, southwest China	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Caohai Lake is a typical natural lake-type karst plateau wetland, which is sensitive to environmental changes, and the release of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in sediment is a potential factor of nitrogen pollution in this lake. Therefore, we aimed to reveal the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics and source analysis of DON in karst lake sediment. Surface sediment samples were collected from Caohai Lake in southwest China, and the sample locations were distributed across almost the entire wetland area, during both the wet and dry seasons. The DON content and fluorescence spectroscopy were determined and analysed using a three-dimensional fluorescence-parallel factor analysis (3DEEM-PARAFAC) model. The mean DON content in the sediment during the dry season (67.79 +/- 42.96 mg/kg) was higher than that in the wet season (28.57 +/- 20.97 mg/kg). There were four fluorescent components of DON in the sediment: C1 (tyrosine-like protein), C2 (terrestrial humus), C3 (tryptophan-like protein) and C4 (terrestrial humus). The DON in the surface sediment of Caohai Lake was influenced by terrestrial sources and biological activities. These findings help reveal the circulation mechanism of endogenous nitrogen in the lake and provide theoretical support for the prevention and control of nitrogen pollution in Caohai Lake.

The sample set contained six soil samples that were collected directly adjacent to large tropical rivers, and that were, therefore, subject to seasonal flooding. Molecular evidence for the formation of anaerobic microenvironments in these soils during the flooding period was obtained; this was based on the presence of several ring-A-degraded higher plant triterpenoids, products of the anaerobic degradation of 3-oxy-triterpenoids. The molecular distribution of other lipid classes such as n-alkanes, n-alkanols, fatty acids and sterols are also reported here and compared to the organic matter of rivers from the Orinoco Basin.

J	Chang, KH; Hanazato, T				Chang, KH; Hanazato, T			Predation impact of Leptodora kindtii on population dynamics and morphology of Bosmina fatalis and B-longirostris in mesocosms	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. We assessed the impact of predation by the invertebrate predator Leptodora kindtii on Bosmina longirostris and B. fatalis, which show seasonal and reciprocal succession patterns in Lake Suwa, in a mesocosm experiment using 20-L tanks with or without the predator under different food conditions. We also analysed morphological responses of the two Bosmina species to the predator in the tanks. 2. Bosmina fatalis dominated B. longirostris regardless of predator presence under high food density. However, the presence of Leptodora induced the dominance of B. fatalis more rapidly than its absence. On the contrary, no dominance of B. fatalis was observed in tanks with low food density, irrespective of the presence of the predator. Only B. fatalis showed morphological changes in response to the presence of Leptodora. 3. Mucrone length and antennule shape (angle between body and antennule and angle between antennules) showed marked responses at both high and low food densities, but antennule length responded only at high food density. Mucrone length seems to be a more effective defence against Leptodora. 4. The results suggest that B. fatalis is a superior competitor against B. longirostris and is more resistant to Leptodora predation, especially in good food conditions. The repeatedly observed seasonal succession of the two Bosmina species in the eutrophic Lake Suwa - the replacement of B. longirostris by B. fatalis following the occurrence of abundant Leptodora- seems to be caused by the selective predation of Leptodora on B. longirostris as well as the competitive ability of B. fatalis.						chang, Kwang-Hyeon/0000-0002-7952-4047													0046-5070					MAR	2004	49	3					253	264		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2004.01181.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2004.01181.x													WOS:000188989600003
J	Paukert, CP; Willis, DW				Paukert, CP; Willis, DW			Seasonal and diel habitat selection by bluegills in a shallow natural lake	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Habitat use by bluegill Lepomis macrochirus may be dictated by the avoidance of predators and the availability of prey. Previous work suggests that bluegills large enough to avoid predators will select habitats based on foraging profitability. However, these studies focused on smaller fish (<150 mm standard length) in laboratory experiments or in natural systems with distinct vegetated and open-water habitats. Our objective was to use radio telemetry to determine monthly and diel vegetation selection by larger (>200 mm total length [TL]) bluegills in a shallow (mean depth = 1.2 m), 332-ha, natural lake (Pelican Lake, Nebraska) with both emergent and submergent vegetation distributed throughout. A total of 78 bluegills (200-273 mill TL) were implanted with radio transmitters and relocated daily for 6 d per month (April-September); up to 20 of the tagged fish were relocated every 2 h for a 24-h period once each month. Regardless of diel period, bluegills used open-water, emergent vegetation, submergent vegetation, and mixed emergent- submergent vegetation habitat types in similar proportions. During April, June, and July, male bluegills positively selected emergent vegetation, whereas female bluegills showed no vegetation selection preference during any month. Throughout the study period, bluegills never avoided open-water habitats, suggesting that larger individuals may continue to use open-water habitats in proportion to their availability. In addition, emergent vegetation appeared to be important, particularly for male bluegills. Although the mechanism for the positive selection of emergent vegetation by males was unclear, the protection or enhancement of such habitats may facilitate the preservation of quality bluegill populations in shallow lakes.

Within this framework we studied the effect of resource limitation on the behaviour of mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) ducklings in boreal lakes. One group of 12 human-imprinted ducklings (4-16 days old) were taken to 11 "rich" lakes, i.e., with a relatively high concentration of total phosphorus in the water, and the other group of 12 ducklings to 11 "poor" lakes to forage for a period of 6 h. During this, a time budget study lasting 5 min was done of each of the 12 ducklings. In the rich lakes, ducklings fed significantly more and moved less than in the poor ones. This difference was particularly striking in above-surface feeding. Variation in foraging performance was associated with change in body mass of the ducklings: the less distance the ducklings moved and the more they fed above water, the more they gained mass. Earlier results had suggested that at least some of the boreal wetlands that lack duck broods year after year (70% of the total in one study) do so because they do not harbour enough food. Hence, it is possible that mallard populations are resource-limited at the brood stage during the breeding season.

J	dos Reis, RJ; Dias, NL				dos Reis, RJ; Dias, NL			Multi-season lake evaporation: energy-budget estimates and CRLE model assessment with limited meteorological observations	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												A lake evaporation study was conducted on a small water-supply reservoir (8.8 km(2)) in Minas Gerais State, Brazil, during 30 months. Air temperature and humidity, wind speed and direction, sunshine duration and solar radiation were measured continuously, together with monthly water temperature profiles. This allowed the calculation of evaporation by the energy-budget Bowen ratio (EBBR) method, as well as evaporation estimates using a climatological model, the Complementary Relationship Lake Evaporation (CRLE), which is widely used by electricity companies in Brazil. The CRLE is probably the most complete model available for lake evaporation that requires only monthly means of air temperature, air humidity and sunshine duration (or solar radiation), and provides estimates not only of monthly evaporation but of the rate of change of stored enthalpy in the lake's waters and equilibrium temperature, a surrogate of the actual water surface temperature. Since all of the model's variables are amenable to physical interpretation, it is possible to relate them to the actually measured values. We have found that the Priestley-Taylor equation, which is the basis of CRLE's evaporation estimates, performs Very well under conditions of positive (upward) sensible heat flux. The model's equilibrium temperature underestimates the actual water surface temperature but follows the same seasonal pattern. The model's estimates of the rate of change of stored enthalpy are generally poor, making the CRLE generate evaporation values that are delayed and damped in comparison with the EBBR method. The CRLE tends to overestimate evaporation slightly (8%) over the 30-month period. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Geochemical behavior and dissolved species control in acid sand pit lakes, Sepetiba sedimentary basin, Rio de Janeiro, SE - Brazil	JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES												This work shows the influence of pluvial waters on dissolved components and mineral equilibrium of four sand pit lakes, located in the Sepetiba sedimentary basin, SE Brazil. The sand mining activities promote sediment oxidation, lowering pH and increasing SO4 contents. The relatively high acidity of these waters, similar to ore pit lakes environment and associated acid mine drainage, increases weathering rate, especially of silicate minerals, which produces high Al concentrations, the limiting factor for fish aquaculture. During the dry season, basic cations (Ca, Mg, K and Na), SiO2 and Al show their higher values due to evapoconcentration and pH are buffered. In the beginning of the wet season, the dilution factor by rainwater increases SO4 and decreases pH values. The aluminum monomeric forms (Al (OH)(2+) and Al(OH)(2)(+)), the most toxic species for aquatic organisms, occur during the dry season, while AlSO4+ species predominate during the wet season. Gibbsite, allophane, alunite and jurbanite are the reactive mineral phases indicated by PHREEQC modeling. During the dry season, hydroxialuminosilicate allophane is the main phase in equilibrium with the solution, while the sulphate salts alunite and jurbanite predominate in the rainy season due to the increasing of SO4 values. Gibbsite is also in equilibrium with sand pit lakes waters, pointing out that hydrolysis reaction is a constant process in the system. Comparing to SiO2, sulphate is the main Al retriever in the pit waters because the most samples (alunite and jurbanite) are in equilibrium with the solution in both seasons. This Al hydrochemical control allied to some precaution, like pH correction and fertilization of these waters, allows the conditions for fishpond culture. Equilibrium of the majority samples with kaolinite (Ca, Mg, Na diagrams) and primary minerals (K diagram) points to moderate weathering rate in sand pit sediments, which cannot be considered for the whole basin due to the anomalous acidification of the studied waters.

J	Umaña-Villalobos, G				Umana-Villalobos, Gerardo			Temporal variation of phytoplankton in a small tropical crater lake, Costa Rica	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												The temporal variation in lake's phytoplankton is important to understand its general biodiversity. For tropical lakes, it has been hypothesized that they follow a similar pattern as temperate ones, on a much accelerated pace; nevertheless, few case studies have tried to elucidate this. Most studies in Costa Rica have used a monthly sampling scheme and failed in showing the expected changes. In this study, the phytoplankton of the small Barvas's crater lake was followed for more than three years, first with monthly and later with weekly samplings, that covered almost two years. Additional information on temperature and oxygen vertical profiles was obtained on a monthly basis, and surface temperature was measured during weekly samplings around noon. Results showed that in spite of its shallow condition (max. depth: 7m) and low surface temperature (11 to 19 degrees C), the lake stratifies at least for brief periods. The phytoplankton showed both, rapid change periods, and prolonged ones of relative stasis. The plankton composition fluctuated between three main phases, one characterized by the abundance of small sized desmids (Staurastrum paradoxum, Cosmarium asphaerosporum), a second phase dominated by equally small cryptomonads (Chryptochrysis minor, Chroomonas sp.) and a third phase dominated by the green alga Eutetramorus tetrasporus. Although data evidenced that monthly sampling could miss short term events, the temporal variation did not follow the typical dry and rainy seasons of the region, or any particular annual pattern. Year to year variation was high. As this small lake is located at the summit of Barva Volcano and receives the influence from both the Caribbean and the Pacific weather, seasonality at the lake is not clearly defined as in the rest of the country and short term variations in the local weather might have a stronger effect than broad seasonal trends. The occurrence of this short term changes in the phytoplankton of small tropical lakes in response to weather variations needs to be further explored in other lakes. Rev. Biol.

Performance and ecological impacts of benthic barriers for the control of an invasive plant in a small urban lake	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Yellow Floating Heart (YFH), Nymphoides peltata, is a rooted aquatic plant that is not native to North America, and can quickly establish nuisance populations in shallow lakes, rivers, and wetlands. There are few documented methods for effectively eradiating or controlling YFH. Little Albro Lake is a small (3 ha), shallow (< 5 m deep) meso-eutrophic lake in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada that experiences an annual YFH infestation covering > 50% of the lake during the growing season. A pilot study was conducted during the 2021 growing season to: (i) assess the feasibility of using benthic barriers to control YFH growth, and (ii) investigate the potential impacts of benthic barriers on ecosystem components. Two commercially available benthic barriers (Aquascreen, a permeable barrier, and Lake Bottom Blanket, an impermeable barrier) were tested in shallow (1 m water depth) and deep (3 m water depth) areas of the lake. A total of 18 test plots (6 permeable, 6 impermeable, 6 control), each measuring 3 m x 3 m, were established in early May 2021, and monitored throughout the growing season (May-September). Both types of barriers were effective in reducing YFH growth, with barriered plots possessing significantly less YFH coverage than control plots. Inspection of the permeable barriers after their removal from the lake, however, revealed that YFH had been able to grow through this type of barrier material. Several maintenance issues were also noted with both barriers including: (i) gas build-up under the barriers, which caused billowing, and (ii) an accumulation of sediment on top of the barriers and growth of YFH through these sediment layers. Both issues would need to be managed during a full-scale benthic barrier application program. An environmental effects monitoring program was also undertaken to understand the lake ecosystem and im-pacts of the barriers on the chemical and biological properties of the lakebed. The barriers had measurable impacts on the lakebed and generated lower oxidation reduction potential (ORP) in sediments, as compared to control plots with no barriers. Reduced ORP in lake sediments could facilitate the mobilization of redox-sensitive metals, such as arsenic and iron. There were only minor differences in benthic macroinvertebrate populations when comparing barriered and control plots. The bacterial alpha-diversity of the lakebed sediment was shown to differ by depth, with the shallow zone having higher observed ASVs and diversity levels. However, within the two depth zones, the barriers did not appear to have a large impact on bacterial community composition and potential functionality. In conclusion, benthic barriers can be used to prevent YFH growth, however barrier installations require maintenance and may reduce sediment ORP, potentially leading to release of redox-sensitive metals and nutrients.																			0925-8574	1872-6992				NOV	2022	184								106784	10.1016/j.ecoleng.2022.106784	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2022.106784		SEP 2022											WOS:000860264200002
J	Sim, LL; Davis, JA; Chambers, JM; Strehlow, K				Sim, Lien L.; Davis, Jenny A.; Chambers, Jane M.; Strehlow, Karin			What evidence exists for alternative ecological regimes in salinising wetlands?	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Land clearing in Australia's southwest has led to widespread salinisation of aquatic ecosystems. Four different ecological regimes (clear, submerged macrophyte-dominated; clear, benthic microbial community-dominated; turbid, phytoplankton-dominated; and turbid, sediment-dominated) have previously been identified in the salinising wetlands of this region. 2. Monitoring data from seven saline wetlands over an 18-month period were used to evaluate whether a continuum, simple threshold or alternative regimes conceptual model (sensu Hydrobiologia, 200/201, 1990, 367; Hydrobiologia, 200/201, 1990, 475) most appropriately represented transitions between these ecological regimes. We also aimed to identify whether factors other than salinity played a major role in defining ecological regimes or causing shifts between them. 3. Ordination of biological variables revealed a separation of benthic microbial community-dominated from submerged macrophyte-dominated sites and times. The mean salinities of these two groups were very similar, suggesting that a salinity threshold was not responsible for benthic microbial versus macrophyte dominance. No other environmental variable was found to have a strong, direct influence on the groupings. 4. The dynamics of regime change in saline wetlands appear not to be driven by any single variable, but by the combined effects of salinity and water regime on species life histories and competitive abilities. Macrophytes were powerful competitors, able to germinate and establish under a range of salinities, turbidities and water depths, and were favoured by seasonal drying. 5. Data from the seven wetlands indicated that the continuum, simple threshold and alternative regimes conceptual models did not appropriately represent transitions between ecological regimes in seasonally drying wetlands. Macrophyte and benthic microbial regimes occurred at overlapping salinity levels, excluding both the continuum and threshold models, and the regular occurrence of drying appeared to preclude the alternative regimes model. Drying prevented the development of strong positive feedback mechanisms, which might otherwise have maintained the benthic microbial community-dominated regime. We hypothesise that an alternative regimes model might still be valid for salinising ecosystems holding permanent water.

The content of mercury in mussel tissues increased with the size of the animal, but the relationship between Hg concentration and tissue weight was negative, indicating that the rate of mercury accumulation was lower than the tissue growth rate.

Swamps of the Upper White Nile	NILE: ORIGIN, ENVIRONMENTS, LIMNOLOGY AND HUMAN USE	Monographiae Biologicae											The Sudd swamps developed from a large lake which extended north to Khartoum during the Pleistocene. The main channels are stable over decades, but the bends show upstream migrations of about 20 m in 3 years. In permanent swamps the channels often have a band of Vossia, backed by papyrus, which in turn is backed by an extensive area of Typha domingensis. Before 1950 the Nile Cabbage, Pistia stratiotes, was an important part of the floating vegetation in permanent swamps, but in recent years it has been largely replaced by Eichhornia crassipes. Seasonal flooding enables the growth of grasses such as Echinochloa spp. and Oryza longistaminata. Further from the channels, where rain is the main source of water, Hyparrhenia rufa is the main grass. The grasslands grade into open woodland with Acacia seyal and Balanites aegyptiacus. A rich fauna was associated with Pistia, and a similarly rich fauna has developed around the invasive Eichhornia. The marginal vegetation shelters an association of microcrustacea, with a biomass 100 times that in the open water. Macro invertebrates are also abundant and diverse; for instance there are at least 70 species of aquatic Coleoptera, 60 species of mosquitoes, and a special fauna of terrestrial forms occurs in the umbels of papyrus. About 68 species of fish occur, and they occupy a wide range of niches, from mud feeders to carnivores.

Variation of water quality in Kakira catchment area, Jinja - Uganda	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH					9th Annual Symposium of the WaterNet/WARF SA/GWP-SA on Water and Sustainable Development for Improved Livelihoods	OCT 29-31, 2008	Johannesburg, SOUTH AFRICA	WaterNet, Water Res Fund SE Africa, Global Water Partnership SE Africa				Kakira Sugar Works Limited (KSWL) owns one of the largest commercial sugarcane plantations and factory in Uganda. KSWL uses fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides to enhance crop yields. This study was carried out to assess the effect of the KSWL sugarcane plantation on the water resources of Lake Victoria. Water quality assessment within and without the sugarcane plantation was carried out for six months over two seasons (wet and dry) and these were tested for physico-chemical parameters. Temperature values at all the sampling sites were <35 degrees C. pH values at all the sampling sites were within the range of 6.0-8.5 except S4 which was located in the outgrowers' field (pH = 5.9). Electrical conductivity values on the stream draining through the workers settlement was high (1412.3 mu S/cm) compared to the other sampling sites which had values <300 mu S/cm. NH4-N and TN values at all the sampling sites were <10 mg/l. Although TP and O-PO4-P values for all the streams were within standards recommended by the National Environment Standard (Standards for Discharge of Effluents onto Water or on Land Regulations) of 1999 for Uganda, the sampling sites including the one located at the lake did not qualify to be categorized as being pristine. Nutrient loads were higher during the wet season than in the dry season. Nutrient loads from the estate were higher than those from the outgrowers' field. in spite of the fact that nutrient concentrations were within permissible limits, it was concluded that annual nutrient loads of nitrogen and phosphorus could in a long run increase the trophic levels of Lake Victoria.

Helminth communities of the roach (Rutilus rutilus) from Kocadere stream in Bursa,Turkey: occurrence, intensity, seasonality and their infestations linked to host fish size	BULLETIN OF THE EUROPEAN ASSOCIATION OF FISH PATHOLOGISTS												Helminth communities and their prevalence, intensity and abundance were studied with respect to seasonal variation and host size in a population of roach (Rutilus rutilus) from Kocadere stream, Turkey. A total of 113 individuals of roach were examined for helminth parasites from February 2005 to January 2006. Of the 113 R. rutilus, 72 (63.7%) were found to be infected by one or more parasite species. In total, four helminth parasite species were identified: Monogeneans - Dactylogyrus crucifer; Cestoda - Bothriocephalus acheilognathi; Nematoda - Eustrongylides sp. larvae, and Contracaecum sp. larvae. D. crucifer was the most common species in this study and a total of 1946 specimens were recorded on 66 fishes. The abundance of D. crucifer varied highly significantly during the investigation period and increased from February to March-April (peak), followed by a sharp decrease thereafter. As regards the abundance of the parasite species depending on the fish length, the highest frequency of distribution of D. crucifer was found on host with 18.5 - 21.5 cm. However, no correlation existed between fish length and parasite abundance (r = -0.08; p>0.001). The overall prevalence and mean intensity were 58.4% and 29.4, respectively. The infection levels peaked (100%) in April, May and July. This species was not detected in the November and December samples. Two B. acheilognathi were found in one fish (0.8%) whereas Eustrongylides sp. larvae and Contracaecum sp. larvae were recorded in four (3.5%) and one (0.8%) fish examined, repectively.

J	Ludovisi, A				Ludovisi, A			Use of thermodynamic indices as ecological indicators of the development state of lake ecosystems: Specific dissipation	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS					Conference on Theoretical Fundamentals of Consistent Applications in Environmental Management	SEP, 2003	Villa Vigoni, ITALY					This paper proposes the ratio between the entropy produced and the exergy stored by the biological component of an ecosystem (which may be called the specific entropy production or the specific dissipation of a community) as a tool for understanding the evolution of ecological systems. Specific dissipation, which may be taken as representing a renewed version of Odum's Schrodinger ratio, is here proposed as an indicator of ecosystems maturity as well as an ecological orientor whose minimisation is expected throughout ecosystem development. After having presented an empirical method for estimating the specific dissipation in lake ecosystems, it has been applied to the characterization of the development state of the communities of a set of shallow lakes which lye from oligotrophic to hyper-eutrophic conditions. The adequacy of the proposed indicator has been tested and discussed along two different ecological series: the seasonal progression of phytoplankton and the trophic gradient. The results confirm that the ratio is an appropriate indicator of ecosystem maturity and support the hypothesis that its minimisation is one of the primary "goals" of ecosystem development.

J	Malmaeus, JM; Rydin, E				Malmaeus, JM; Rydin, E			A time-dynamic phosphorus model for the profundal sediments of Lake Erken, Sweden	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Phosphorus profiles in core samples from Lake Erken (Sweden) sediments are combined with a seasonal study of surficial sediments and pore water measurements to develop a model of the phosphorus dynamics in these sediments. Phosphorus is divided into four functional groups: inert phosphorus, organic phosphorus, phosphorus sorbed to iron and phosphorus dissolved in pore water. The model includes processes of sedimentation, burial, chemical equilibrium between dissolved phosphorus and phosphorus sorbed to iron, mineralization of organic phosphorus and vertical diffusion. The model is shown to produce reasonable profiles of concentrations of the four forms of phosphorus in the sediment compared with empirical data. About 50% of the settled phosphorus is eventually buried, and the rest is released to the overlying water column. The amount of phosphorus released is sensitive to temperature and oxygen concentration in the bottom water. Extrapolating the results to the whole area of sediment accumulation is not straightforward, but we suggest that around 3.0 tons of phosphorus is released annually from the profundal sediments of Lake Erken. Year to year variations in internal loading were related to the anoxic area, and we suggest that a shift in the sediment-water equilibrium of P due to an expected increase in temperature may result in increasing phosphorus concentration in the water column.																			1015-1621	1420-9055				JAN	2006	68	1					16	27		10.1007/s00027-005-0801-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-005-0801-6													WOS:000235912300003

Depositional conditions of carbonate-dominated palustrine sedimentation around the K-T boundary (Facies Rognacien, northeastern Pyrenean foreland, southwestern France)	PALEOENVIRONMENTAL RECORD AND APPLICATIONS OF CALCRETES AND PALUSTRINE CARBONATES	Geological Society of America Special Papers											The Facies Rognacien is a sequence of highly bioturbated and pedogenically modified palustrine carbonates that were deposited under oxic conditions around the Cretaceous-Tertiary (K-T) boundary in the northeastern Pyrenean foreland basin (SW France). The sedimentary structures and early diagenetic features identified (mottling, nodule formation, brecciation, pseudomicrokarst, cracking, charophytes, Microcodium) suggest deposition in a palustrine environment between the subarid and intermediate climate type. Sedimentological and paleoecological analysis enables us to distinguish two facies associations, the lacustrine pond facies and the freshwater marsh facies associations. The majority of the carbonates are attributed to the freshwater marsh facies. The lacustrine pond facies occurs only in isolated paleolows, and is identified on the basis of its paleobiological content (charophytes, ostracodes). This suggests that the palustrine carbonates of the Facies Rognacien were deposited in a seasonal wetland (carbonate-producing freshwater marsh), rather than in the marginal zone of a large, shallow lake. In this wetland paleoenvironment, all carbonates underwent widespread pedogenesis, and small, ephemeral ponds are of limited distribution, most likely recording deposition in paleolows.

The month of infection was estimated by subtracting 4 months from the date when eggs of F. gigantica were detected in faeces. Farmers were interviewed each month to record the nature of the agricultural and animal husbandry activities that occurred during the previous month, especially events that might have exposed cattle to infection with F. gigantica. Results support the conclusions that infection of cattle in riverbank villages acquired from about August or September until November originated from herbage and water in irrigation canals and dams on the riverbank, and that the progressively increasing monthly incidence from December until April (up to 87% per month in April 2000) was derived from herbage and water in recently harvested rice fields and lakes adjacent to the riverbank. The abrupt cessation of new infection in riverbank villages in May coincided with flooding of low-lying land, the movement of cattle to land above flood height on the riverbank, and a change of diet to dry-land crop residues, stored dry rice stalks, and herbage and water that were unlikely to contain metacercariae. It was concluded that snails in dams and canals on the riverbank became infected with F. gigantica after cattle were moved to the riverbank in May, and cercariae shed from these snails provided the new infections that occurred in cattle in August and September. In the village located away from the river, infection of cattle between September and March coincided with the rice harvest, supporting the conclusion that feeding of fresh rice stalks and stubble after the rice was harvested was the main source of infection. The low monthly incidence observed (up to 6.4% per month) was consistent with the hypothesis that snails did not survive in the dry rice fields between crops and that few snails would have been available from the small number of aquatic refuges that persisted through the dry season to recolonize rice fields during the wet season. Between April and August there was no opportunity for new infection because cattle were fed forage from around houses and headlands, and on dry-land crop residues and stored dry rice stalks. Control of fasciolosis was proposed using a single treatment of cattle with triclabendazole in riverbank villages in May when cattle were moved to the riverbank, and after harvest of the last rice field in villages located away from the river.

When sampled in 1999, the lake exhibited a permanent stratification separating the 3-5 m thick, oxygenated epilimnion from the anoxic hypolimnion. The rate of anaerobic organic carbon mineralization below the oxycline was on the order of 1 mumol C m(-2) s(-1) and did not show a pronounced difference between wet and dry seasons. Methanogenesis accounted for 76-83% of anaerobic carbon mineralization, with lesser contributions of sulfate reduction and dissimilatory iron reduction. Upward mixing of reduced inorganic solutes explained 90% of the water column O-2 demand during the dry season, while most O-2 consumption during the wet season was coupled to aerobic respiration of organic matter synthesized in the surface waters. Inorganic mercury species represented 10-40% of total dissolved mercury in the epilimnion, but were of relatively minor importance (less than or equal to10%) in the anoxic portion of the water column. Net production of soluble organic mercury compounds in the flooded soils and anoxic water column did not vary significantly between wet and dry seasons. Methylmercury accounted for about 15% of total dissolved mercury below the oxycline. Its estimated net production rate, 0.04 mg m(-2) yr(-1), is of the same order of magnitude as values reported for contaminated lakes and flooded terrestrial ecosystems.

The PM,, concentration had a large gradient from West to East, averaging 3 mu g/m(3) in most of the West compared to 13 mu g/m(3) in the Appalachian region. Coarse particle concentration (2.5-10 mu m) exhibited a small gradient from North to South, but no gradient from West to East. No change in PM(2.5) or PM,, was observed from 1988 to 1993 for sites with complete records. The elemental concentration (H, Na-Pb) was determined from all PM(2.5) Teflon filters and from the PM(10) filters from four sites: an eastern and western urban site (Washington, D.C. and South Lake Tahoe) and the nearest Class I site (Shenandoah and Bliss). Soil was the largest component of the coarse particle concentration. Sulfur accounted for 3% of the coarse particle concentration in the western pair, and 16-24% in the eastern pair. The urban sites had more organic, elemental carbon, and nitrate in the PM(2.5) fraction than the associated Class I sites, and more soil and organics in the coarse particle fraction.																			1047-3289					FEB	1997	47	2					194	203		10.1080/10473289.1997.10464422	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10473289.1997.10464422													WOS:A1997WJ72900010
J	Hall, LW; Anderson, RD				Hall, Lenwood W.; Anderson, Ronald D.			Historical Global Review of Acid-Volatile Sulfide Sediment Monitoring Data	SOIL SYSTEMS												Acid-volatile sulfides (AVS) are strongly associated with the bioavailability of some divalent metals such as cadmium, copper, lead, nickel and zinc. However, the global spatial variability of AVS for aquatic systems is unknown. The specific goals of this study were to: (1) summarize all available AVS monitoring data from all types of freshwater and saltwater waterbodies (streams/creeks, rivers, lakes/ponds/reservoirs and estuarine/marine areas) and (2) compare AVS concentrations from these various types of waterbodies considering both soil type classification and biomes. AVS measurements were reported from 21 different countries. A total of 17 different soil types were reported for all waterbody types and both podzols and luvisols were found in all waterbody types. Nine different biomes were sampled for all waterbody types. The temperate broadleaf and mixed forest biome was sampled for AVS in all waterbody types. Mean AVS concentrations ranged from 0.01 to 503 mu moles/g for 140 different waterbody types and the 90th centile for all these waterbodies was 49.4 mu moles/g. A ranking of waterbody type means from low to high AVS measurements showed the lowest mean value was reported for streams/creeks (5.12 mu moles/g; range from 0.1 to 39.8 mu moles/g) followed by lakes/ponds/reservoirs (11.3 mu moles/g; range from 0.79 to 127 mu moles/g); estuarine/marine areas (27.2 mu moles/g; range from 0.06 to 503 mu moles/g) and rivers (27.7 mu moles/g; range from 1.13 to 197 mu moles/g). The data provided in this study are compelling as it showed that the high variability of AVS measurements within each waterbody type as well as the variability of AVS within specific locations were often multiple orders of magnitude differences for concentration ranges. Therefore, a comprehensive spatial and temporal scale sampling of AVS in concert with divalent metals analysis is critical to avoid possible errors when evaluating the potential ecological risk of divalent metals in sediment.																				2571-8789				SEP	2022	6	3							71	10.3390/soilsystems6030071	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/soilsystems6030071													WOS:000859798300001

Based on PIE cloud computing platform, the study uses Landsat images and the empirical normalized water body index (ENDWI) to extract water body information of the large lakes in Sichuan province from 2000 to 2020 in the drought and rainy seasons, respectively, and uses the Mann-Kendall test to obtain the long-term trends of their area and climate. On this basis, the evolution of the lakes and their correlation with climate and human activities are analyzed. The results show that (1) In the past 20 years, the area of Lugu Lake, Qionghai Lake, and Luban Reservoir represent a decreasing trend, with Lugu Lake being the most affected. The area of Ma Lake, Three Forks Lake, and Shengzhong Reservoir increased, with the area of Shengzhong Reservoir increasing significantly; (2) During the drought season, all six lakes showed a decreasing trend in precipitation, with the most apparent decreasing trend for Lugu Lake (Slope = -0.8). Only Lugu Lake showed a decreasing trend in precipitation (Slope = -0.15) during the rainy season. The precipitation of Ma Lake, Three Forks Lake, Luban Reservoir and Shengzhong Reservoir showed a significant increasing trend (Slope value was greater than 1.96); (3) The temperatures of the remaining lakes all decreased in the drought season and increased in the rainy season, except that the temperature of Shengzhong Reservoir decreases throughout the year; (4) The area change of plain lakes is greatly affected by human activities, but the area of plateau lakes is are more impacted by climate. Our study improved the accuracy of long-term water body change monitoring with PIE-Engine Studio. Besides, the findings would provide reference for the implementation of sustainable water resources management in Sichuan Province.					; Meilian, Wang/KPB-1539-2024; Li, Weile/AAD-2385-2019; wang, youlin/GRS-4916-2022; liu, dongsheng/IWM-1597-2023; dai, Xiaoai/KJM-0593-2024; liu, xinyi/KFB-4466-2024	wang, meilian/0000-0003-3854-9755; , Xiaoai/0000-0003-1342-6417; shan, yunfeng/0000-0003-0047-1585; Li, Weile/0000-0002-3741-8801														2073-4441				SEP	2022	14	18							2816	10.3390/w14182816	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14182816													WOS:000856894600001

The impact of diquat on macrophytes and water quality in battle ground lake, Washington	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC PLANT MANAGEMENT												A nearly monotypic population of egeria (Egeria densa Planch.) was interfering with recreation in a popular lake in southwest Washington. In June 2003 the littoral zone was treated with the contact herbicide diquat (6,7-dihydrodipyrido [1,2-a2',1'-c] pyrazinediium dibromide). Aquatic plant frequency and biomass data were collected on all submersed species before treatment, and eight weeks, one year and two years after treatment. Water quality and herbicide dissipation data were also collected before and for one season after the treatment. Results from the aquatic plant data showed a significant reduction in egeria frequency and biomass after the herbicide treatment, although the species did not disappear entirely. Two native submersed species, water moss (Fontinalis antipyretica Hedw.) and stonewort (Nitella sp.), increased after treatment. However their increase was not enough to offset the egeria population reduction, as total plant abundance was significantly reduced after treatment. The herbicide dissipation data illustrated the dispersal of diquat throughout the lake and persistence at low concentrations (up to 10.4 ppb) in the water column for at least two weeks after treatment. Water quality data demonstrated a slight decrease in dissolved oxygen and water transparency following the herbicide treatment, potentially due to plant die-off and subsequent plant decomposition.																			0146-6623					JAN	2007	45						35	39																WOS:000245532200007
J	Kochi, K; Kobayashi, M; Hirotaka, S				Kochi, Kaori; Kobayashi, Makoto; Hirotaka, Sora			Diet of Ictalurus punctatus (Actinopterygii, Ictaluridae) in a mountain reservoir surrounded by forest land in Japan	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus (Rafinesque, 1818), is non-native to Japan and has been invading Japanese rivers and lakes after its introduction in Japan for aquaculture. Little information exists on the feeding habits of I. punctatus in small reservoirs surrounded by forests; therefore, it remains unknown how these fish may affect native species. Therefore, we investigated channel catfish-feeding habits in a small mountain reservoir (0.95 km(2) of submerged area) in Japan between June 2016 and September 2019. Stomach content and stable isotope analyses were performed to identify the species' food resources according to their lengths, seasons, and years. It was found that channel catfish with a length < 30 cm fed on aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates, and the 30-50-cm-long individuals tended to be ichthyophagous. Seasonal trends in its feeding habits were noted; in October and November, channel catfish relied on fish as a food resource. The conditions of this species were stable for months and years; its condition was greater than that reported in previous studies, including those from countries to which it is native. These results indicate that the reservoir environment constantly provided food resources for channel catfish, and they could survive in it.

J	Garnier, J; Billen, G; Sanchez, N; Leporcq, B				Garnier, J; Billen, G; Sanchez, N; Leporcq, B			Ecological functioning of the Marne reservoir (upper Seine basin, France)	REGULATED RIVERS-RESEARCH & MANAGEMENT												The Marne reservoir (Der and Champaubert Lakes, 48 km(2), 8 m mean depth) is one of the three major reservoirs constructed on the upper reaches of the Seine river to regulate its flow. The major features of the ecological functioning of the reservoir were analysed on the basis of results obtained in a 3-year routine sampling programme where the main variables of water quality were determined upstream, downstream and within the reservoir. Planktonic and benthic processes were also investigated in 1 year. A model of the reservoir was developed by coupling the RIVE model (which describes the major microbiological processes involved in the ecological functioning of aquatic systems), with a description of the morphology and hydrology of the reservoir. The model was used to simulate the seasonal and year-to-year variations of nutrients (N, P, Si) and phytoplankton biomass, and to compare them with the observed data. The model was then used to explore the effect of different control factors on denitrification, namely residence times and phosphorus loading. The results showed little influence on the absolute amount of nitrate denitrified within a realistic range of residence times and phosphorus loading. The Marne reservoir appears however to be a significant sink for nitrate (40% of the influx is eliminated), but this reduction represents only 10% of the nitrate flux at the outlet of the Marne sub-basin.

J	Pitt, KA; Kingsford, MJ				Pitt, KA; Kingsford, MJ			Geographic separation of stocks of the edible jellyfish Catostylus mosaicus (Rhizostomeae) in New South Wales, Australia	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The population structure of the commercially harvested jellyfish Catostylus mosaicus (Scyphozoa, Rhizostomeae) was investigated in estuaries and bays in New South Wales, Australia. Variations in abundance and recruitment were studied in 6 estuaries separated by distances ranging from 75 to 800 km. Patterns of abundance differed greatly among estuaries and the rank abundance among estuaries changed on 5 out of the 6 times sampling occurred. Great variation in the timing of recruitment was also observed among estuaries. Variations in abundance and recruitment were as extreme among nearby estuaries as distant ones. Broad scale sampling and detailed time series of abundance over a period of 2.7 yr at 2 locations showed no consistent seasonal trend in abundance at 1 location, but there was some indication of seasonality at the second location. At Botany Bay, the abundance of medusae increased with distance into the estuary and on 19 out of the 30 times sampling occurred medusae were found at sites adjacent to where rivers enter the bay. Medusae were found to be strong swimmers and this may aid medusae in maintaining themselves in the upper-reaches of estuaries, where advection from an estuary is least likely. Variability in patterns of abundance and recruitment suggested regulation by processes occurring at the scale of individual estuaries and, combined with their relatively strong swimming ability, supported a model of population retention within estuaries. Populations of C. mosaicus in individual estuaries and saline lakes in New South Wales should, therefore, be considered as separate stock units.

Structural variations among monocot emergent and amphibious species from lakes of the semi-arid region of Bahia, Brazil	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY												Temporary lakes are common in the semi-arid region of the State of Bahia and form water mirrors in the rainy season. In this period, various vegetal species appear having different life forms adapted to the seasonality conditions of the rainfall regime. This work surveyed the adaptive anatomical structures of some emergent and amphibious monocot species occurring in these lakes. We studied the anatomy of roots, rhizomes, leaves and scapes of Cyperus odoratus, Oxycaryum cubense, Pycreus macrostachyos (Cyperaceae) - amphibious species; and of Echinodorus grandiflorus (Alismataceae), Eichhornia paniculata (Pontederiaceae) and Habenaria repens (Orchidaceae) - emergent species. The anatomical features of the dermal, fundamental and vascular systems confirming the tendency of the adaptive convergence of these plants to temporary lacustrine the environment include: single layered epidermal cells with a thin cuticle layer in the aerial organs; the presence of air canals in all the organs; few or no supporting tissues; and less numerous conducting elements and thinner cell walls in the xylem. The reduction of the supporting tissues, the number of stomata, which can even be absent, and the number of conducting elements and the degree of cell wall lignification in the xylem of the emergent species is more accentuated than that of the amphibious species. The pattern of distribution of aerenchyma in the roots of the studied species was considered important to distinguish between amphibious and emergent life forms.

Three hydrodynamically different parts of the lagoon were selected, representing transitory oligohaline, intermediate freshwater and stagnant freshwater sites. L. kindtii was least abundant at the oligohaline site, never occurring at salinities greater than 4 psu. At the two freshwater sites, the abundance of L. kindtii varied from a low of < 0.1 up to 2.2 indv. L-1 during peak abundance. Two peaks of L. kindtii abundance were observed with timing differences between stations: at the stagnant site the population of L. kindtii peaked two weeks earlier relative to the more hydrodynamically active sites, likely due to a 2A degrees C higher May temperature. The small body size of L. kindtii in the lagoon (seasonal mean 2.68 +/- 0.6 mm) shows high fish predation pressure and predicts small cladocerans, juvenile copepods and rotifers being in the preferred prey size range. The calculated L. kindtii daily consumption during the population peak was as high as 100% of the daily zooplankton production, which implies high potential of this predator to shape the grazing zooplankton community in the lagoon.

Pseudacris regilla tadpole density differentially affects periphyton and macrophytes in a California vernal pool community	AQUATIC BOTANY												Biotic interactions between herbivores and primary producers are believed to play a major role in determining community composition of many ecological communities. How differences in herbivore abundance alter the relative importance of these interactions is not well understood, especially in seasonal wetland systems. This study investigated the effects of varying Pseudacris regilla (pacific chorus frog) larval densities on California vernal pool aquatic communities. It was hypothesized that with increasing tadpole density, macrophyte percent cover, biomass, diversity, and richness would decrease; while algae and zooplankton abundance, biomass and richness increase. The experimental mesocosm design consisted of five tadpole density treatments, and was arranged in a 5 x 5 randomized block design. Each density treatment was replicated five times. Macrophytes, algae and invertebrates were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic unit, and the biomasses of each community were quantified. Treatment effects were determined using both multivariate and univariate analysis of variance techniques. To detect differences in community composition, multivariate ordination analyses (ANOSIM, SIMPER, NMDS) were conducted. Increasing densities of P. regilla tadpoles had significant effects on the vernal pool macrophyte community. Plant diversity, species richness, biomass, and percent cover were all negatively affected by increasing tadpole densities. Macrophyte community structure was also found to be significantly different in the presence of tadpoles due to the fact that Downingia bicornuta, Ranunculus aquatilis, and Gratiola ebracteata were predominately isolated to mesocosms were P. regilla was absent. In addition, periphyton biomass was shown to be facilitated by increasing tadpole densities in the lower treatment ranges. Aquatic macroinvertebrates and phytoplankton communities, on the other hand, were not significantly affected by increasing tadpole densities. This study demonstrates the influence of P. regilla larvae on the primary producers within California vernal pool systems. Understanding the effects of these abundant consumers, and the mechanisms that drive the importance of their direct and indirect effects are essential for the conservation of vernal pools and the threatened species associated with them.

Diel cycle size-dependent trophic structure of neotropical fishes: a three year case analysis from 35 floodplain lakes in Colombia	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												Investigated were whether fish assemblages in 35 neotropical floodplain lakes along the Magdalena River, Colombia (ranging from 4 to 2333ha) have a trophic structure that is dependent on fish body size within the diel cycle (24h), and whether any changes to the trophic structure of fish assemblages occur during the diel cycle. Sampling was done during diel cycles in the rainy seasons between 2008 and 2011 (ten lakes in 2008, 20 in 2010, and five in 2011). Small fish (27-87mm) were most active from 06:01 to 18:00, while larger predatory fish (>87mm) were inactive during this time. In addition to fish body size, trophic group composition also varied throughout the diel cycle: insectivores, piscivores, and omnivore-insectivores were the dominant groups from 06:01 to 18:00; carnivores, carnivore-insectivores, and detritivores dominated from 18:01 to 06:00. This study highlights the importance of fish size in predicting predator-prey interactions during different periods of the diel cycle.																			0175-8659	1439-0426				AUG	2015	31	4					638	645		10.1111/jai.12748	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jai.12748													WOS:000358083600009

Spartial and Seasonal Variations in Concentrations of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Water and Sediment of Kisumu City Bay of Winam Gulf, Lake Victoria-Kenya	BULLETIN OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												Seasonal and offshore concentration variations for selected sixteen priority pollutant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in surface sediments and water of Car Wash and Kisat areas of Winam Gulf, Lake Victoria, have been investigated. PAHs concentrations in sediments and water range from 0.4 to 31.95 mu g/g dry weight and 3.32 to 55.8 mu g/L, respectively. Statistical analysis of the PAHs concentrations showed that the most contaminated samples are found during rainy season (April, 2006), 5 m offshore for sediments and 10 m offshore for water. Dry season (October, 2005) generally recorded lower concentrations. The variations showed significant difference (p <= 0.05) with season and distance of sampling from the shore.					; Lalah, Joseph/KHW-9278-2024	Kwach, Bowa/0000-0001-5829-1988; 													0007-4861	1432-0800				NOV	2009	83	5					734	741		10.1007/s00128-009-9830-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-009-9830-5								19629366					WOS:000270664300023

Water quality assessment in the Cherry Creek watershed: Patterns of nutrient runoff in an agricultural watershed	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Access to safe, high quality water for consumption, agriculture, industry, and recreation is critically important. Continuous agricultural and mining activities have impaired the waters of the Grand Lake watershed in the central Great Plains region of the United States. The Grand Lake watershed encompasses portions of southeast Kansas, southwest Missouri, northwest Arkansas, and northeast Oklahoma, and drains into Grand Lake in northeast Oklahoma. The Cherry Creek watershed drains approximately 882.2 km(2) (218,000 ac) of land in southeast Kansas and is a contributor of water to the Grand Lake watershed. This paper presents a water quality assessment in the Cherry Creek watershed, with an end toward mitigation of nonpoint source pollutants that are a major contributor to sediment and nutrient contaminants in Grand Lake. A hydrological model was developed using the Hydrological Simulation Program Fortran code and was updated, calibrated, and verified with measured data reported by US Geological Survey (USGS) and the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE). The model was extended to simulate water quality within the study area. Nitrate (NO3--N), total ammonia (TAM), total phosphorus (TP), and orthophosphate (PO43--P) concentrations measured at the USGS stations were used to calibrate the model, and concentrations reported by KDHE at downstream locations were used to verify the model. Results indicate good performance of the hydrological model as tests of fitness were within levels established in previous studies (root-mean-squared-error to standard deviation ratio [RSR] < 0.75; -30% < percentage bias [PBIAS] < 30%; R-2 > 0.6; NS > 0.5). Nutrient measurements below the minimum quantifiable limit (MQL) hampered precise simulation of nutrient changes, though simulated values were acceptable in terms of ranges of contaminant concentration values and seasonal trends. The calibrated model was used to estimate the probability that nutrient levels would exceed established water quality criteria for rivers and streams. Concentration values of NO3--N and TAM are shown to be low for an agricultural watershed: 75% of the NO3--N and TAM concentrations are lower than 0.41 mg L-1. The probability of NO3--N and TAM concentrations being toxic for aquatic communities is lower than 9%. Although model-estimated PO43--P concentrations were low in numerical value (ranging from 0 to 2.60 mg L-1), they could still promote eutrophication according to the accepted 0.05 mg L-1 criteria for maximum PO43--P concentrations in streams. Concentrations of PO43--P in Cherry Creek have a 30.4% probability of exceeding that threshold. Extensive use of animal manure (primarily poultry) or manure from cattle grazing on pasture may account for the elevated levels of PO43--P observed in the watershed. Although nutrient runoff from agricultural watersheds is anticipated to be a major contributor to elevated stream nutrient loads, these results indicate minimal contamination from Cherry Creek.					; Alarcon, Vladimir/P-9202-2016	Sassenrath, Gretchen/0000-0002-0807-1300; Alarcon, Vladimir/0000-0001-6629-5639													0022-4561	1941-3300				MAY-JUN	2018	73	3					229	246		10.2489/jswc.73.3.229	http://dx.doi.org/10.2489/jswc.73.3.229													WOS:000437987000005

Water Quality Assessment Using Physicochemical and Bacteriological Parameters of Fateh Sagar Lake, Udaipur, India	WATER RESOURCES												In the present study assessment of physicochemical and bacteriological parameters of Lake Fateh Sagar of Udaipur (Rajasthan), India was done. Water samples were collected during different seasons for analysis of physicochemical parameters such as pH, temperature, total alkalinity, total hardness, dissolved oxygen, biological oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand. In addition, the bacteriological analysis like total bacterial and coliform count was detected. Incidences of Escherichia coli and their antibiotic resistance pattern were analyzed, which is the major microbiological indicator of faecal contamination. The values of some physicochemical and many of the bacteriological parameters were found above the permissible limits for drinking water recommended by World Health Organization. E. coli isolates were identified by morphological, biochemical and molecular characteristics using E. coli specific 16S rRNA gene based primers namely 16E1, 16E2 and 16E3 and universal primers namely 27F and 1492R by PCR. It was found that most of E. coli strains were strongly resistant to kanamycin, ampicillin, cefixime, polymyxin B, penicillin, vancomycin, rifampicin and streptomycin. The study of water quality is of significant value because the drinking water supply of the city is dependent on this lake and present study indicated that the lake water is polluted with reference to these analyzed parameters.																			0097-8078	1608-344X				MAY	2018	45	3					427	435		10.1134/S0097807818030120	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0097807818030120													WOS:000434918000013
J	Pinto-Coelho, RM				Pinto-Coelho, RM			Effects of eutrophication on seasonal patterns of mesozooplankton in a tropical reservoir: a 4-year study in Pampulha Lake, Brazil	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Pampulha Lake has undergone rapid eutrophication. Annual maxima of total phosphorus and conductivity increased steadily from 1993 to 1996. Nitrogen quickly decreased after macrophyte removal in 1994, but increased again in the following years 2. The zooplankton was dominated by Daphnia gessneri, D. laevis, Diaphanosoma birgei and Thermocyclops decipiens. The biomass of major zooplankton organisms, including Daphnia and rotifers, increased during the period covered in this study. 3. Autocorrelation coefficients have confirmed the existence of recurrent seasonal patterns for both chemical and biological variables. 4. Daphnia, calanoid copepods and rotifers showed clear and recurrent seasonal patterns. Cyclopoid copepods and Diaphanosoma had temporal patterns more affected by longterm trophic changes. Other organisms such as Moina, Ceriodaphnia and Bosmina exhibited high temporal variability with no recurrent patterns. 5. There was a strong and positive correlation between total phosphorus and Daphnia biomass. Seasonal patterns of this cladoceran were also inversely associated with sestonic C:P ratios. Thus, Daphnia may be limited primarily by phosphorus and not by total food availability as expressed by particulate carbon. 6. This study suggests that increasing eutrophication has changed the structure as well as seasonal patterns of the zooplankton community in Pampulha Reservoir.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				AUG	1998	40	1					159	173		10.1046/j.1365-2427.1998.00327.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.1998.00327.x													WOS:000075462200014

A series of leaves, stems and fruits, preserved as impressions, from the Late Miocene Chiquimil Formation in Catamarca and Tucuman provinces are described. They correspond to: sterile fronds of Thelypteris aff. achalensis Abbiati (Thelypteridaceae, Polypocliophyta); four Cyperaceae, viz. achenia of Cyperocarpus sp., stalks and leaves of Scirpitis sp. 1 and S. sp. 2 and some other not classified remains of Cyperaceae; leaves of Nymphaea sp. (Nymphaeaceae) and leaflets and compound leaves of Schinus aff. terebinthifolia Raddi (Anacardiaceae). The Chiquimil Formation has been divided in two members; both (A, El Jarillal and B, Los Ba (n) over tilde os, in the Santa Maria and Villavil valleys, respectively) represent fluvial channels, flood plains and shallow lakes of low and high energy conditions. Plant communities of different associations are found: Nymphaeaceae in the water bodies, while Cyperaceae in swamps and flood plains. Marginal riparian woods contain Thelypteris aff. achalensis in the herbaceous strata and Schinus aff. terebinthifolia in the tree strata. Paleoenvironmental and climatic inferences are established in conjunction with information provided by sediments, associated fresh-water molluscan fauna and paleosols. It is concluded that this vegetation grew under seasonal, subtropical climate.																			0002-7014	1851-8044				SEP 30	2004	41	3					303	314																WOS:000224982500005
J	Jackson, JK; McElravy, EP; Resh, VH				Jackson, JK; McElravy, EP; Resh, VH			Long-term movements of self-marked caddisfly larvae (Trichoptera: Sericostomatidae) in a California coastal mountain stream.	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Over 140 000 larvae of the case-building caddisfly Gumaga nigricula were self-marked as they incorporated glitter into small. portions of their cases while reared in streamside troughs. These marked individuals were released into stream pools and their movements monitored in the dry season, when base flow was low and no spates occurred, and in the wet season when base flow was high and several spates occurred. 2. Of the 9,000-10 000 larvae released in each of two stream pools in the dry season, 4-20% (i.e. 377-1817 marked individuals) were observed on three sampling dates (4, 11 and 24 d after release). Most larvae (87-93%) remained within 4 m up- or downstream of the release line after 24 d. No larvae were found outside of the release pools, even after 37 d. 3. Of the > 120 000 larvae released in one stream pool near the beginning of the wet season, 408 larvae were recaptured 130-167 d later, a period that included 30 days of high flow associated with six spates. Estimated survivorship over this period was 0.7-6.2%; there was no relationship between survival and larval size at release. Most (75%) recaptured larvae were found in the pool where they were originally released. The remaining larvae were found downstream of the release pool. Larvae had generally dispersed only a short distance downstream of the release pool (median = 18 m, maximum = 222 m). In addition, four marked pupae were later found 436 m downstream of the release pool. 4. These results illustrate the sedentary nature of larval G. nigricula as well as the important role that high flow events play in larval mortality and dispersal. These case-building larvae move very little during low flow periods, even when food resources appear limiting. In contrast, the frequency and distance of larval dispersal are much greater during periods with high flow. 5. Our observations for G. nigricula support previously published inferences that larval dispersal within a stream can be limited for some aquatic insects. However, our observations also suggest that, even for a relatively sedentary species Like G. nigricula, larval dispersal during periods with high flow may contribute significantly to gene flow within a stream reach.

A total of 19 species of fish and 2 species of shrimp were recorded. W. attu (9.7-17.8%), Mystus vittatus (6.0-11.3%), M. aor (5.0-12.1%), Amblypharyngodon mola (4.4-9.3%) and Mastacembelus armatus (3.5-10.5%) dominated the catch. W. attu occupied the top position in abundance throughout the year, followed by M. vittatus and M. aor. Bagridae, Siluridae and Cyprinidae were three major families that contributed respectively 21.0, 17.4 and 16.1% of the total catch. Considerable seasonality was observed in the abundance of different fishes. A total of 14 different prey items were recorded, belonging to three major groups (fish, prawn and plant matters). The fish fed on at least eight species of small fishes (A. mola, M. vittatus, M. cavasius, Puntius stigma, P. ticto, Puntius sp., Glossogobius guris, and Heteropneustes fossilis) and some other unidentified small fishes. Other major prey items were small prawn, fish and prawn remains, and macroalgae. A. mola was the most important food item, contributing 23.7% of the total amount of diet by weight and 19.9% by frequency of occurrence. A. mola was followed by unidentified small prawn (13.7%), M. vittatus (13.1%), and unidentified small fishes (8.8%) by weight and by unidentified small fishes (15.9%), fish remains (12.5%), and M. vittatus (12.3%) by occurrence. Of the major diet categories, fish contributed 74.3% of the total diet by weight and 80.9% by occurrence, prawn contributed 18.5% by weight and 11.0% by occurrence and plants contributed 7.2% by weight and 8.1% by occurrence. A. mola and small shrimps were positively selected by W. attu. We concluded that W. attu is a piscivorous predator with potential impacts on prey fish communities; we also hypothesized that a specialized food-web based on the Kata fishery exists in and around the Katas which is of particular ecological significance.					; Rahman, Md.

Point frequency analysis performed at all available sites has shown that the 2-parameter Gamma probability density function is the best model for monthly rainfall frequency over Central and South Florida. The model's parameters estimated at 145 stations were used to provide monthly rainfall estimates for 10- and 100-year dry and wet return periods. Experimental and theoretical variograms computed for these estimates, as well as the Kriging estimation variance maps, show that the existing rain gage network is less capable of resolving monthly rainfall variation in the wet season than the dry season. May is the dry-to-wet transition month, while October is the wet-to-dry transition month with average rainfall of 4.5 inches. Monthly average rainfall is above 7 inches during the wet season and below 3 inches during the dry season. Two-thirds of the annual rainfall is accumulated in the wet season. Annual average rainfall is maximum (above 60 inches) in many areas along the east coast, and is minimum (below 45 inches) in many areas over Lake Okee-chobee and Central Florida. Rainfall maps show a changing pattern between the wet and the dry seasons. Frontal rainfall occurs in the dry season, while convective rainfall, tropical depression, and hurricanes occur in the wet season. Average rainfall is higher along the east coast area in the dry season and it is higher along the west coast area in the wet season.																			1093-474X					AUG	2000	36	4					833	848		10.1111/j.1752-1688.2000.tb04310.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2000.tb04310.x													WOS:000088737800013

After one-month exposure periods from May 1995 to February 1996, mean ciliate biomass decreased with depth (at 1 m 54 kg cm(-2), at 9 in 37 mu g cm(-2) and at 18 m 28 mu g cm(-2)), whereas the mean population density was relatively uniform (675 Ind. cm(-2) at 1 m, 592 Ind. cm(-2) at 9 m, and 678 Ind. cm(-2) at 18 m). Sessile forms (peritrichs and suctorians) were dominant during all exposure periods and at all three depth layers. Omnivorous ciliates were dominant in the epilimnion, whereas in the metalimnion and hypolimnion bacterivores and carnivores were most abundant. Ciliates inhabiting artificial substrates in the epilimnion had two temporal peaks of density and biomass: in June and in October. In the deeper layers these maxima appeared one or two months later. Seasonal changes in ciliate biomass and community and trophic composition were associated with changes in thermal stratification and vertical oxygen gradients as important abiotic parameters, periphyton biomass as food source, and the tufa deposit determining the properties of substrate.

J	Tufford, DL; McKellar, HN; Hussey, JR				Tufford, DL; McKellar, HN; Hussey, JR			In-stream nonpoint source nutrient prediction with land-use proximity and seasonality	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												This research developed multiple regression models relating land use to in-stream concentrations of total nitrogen (TOTN) and total phosphorus (TOTP) in eight, low-order watersheds on the coastal plain of South Carolina, The study area (4860 km(2)) included dominant land-use categories of agriculture, forest, urban, and wetland comprising the lower portion of the Lake Marion drainage. Land-use data were obtained from a pre-existing GIS database derived by classification of satellite images. The models partitioned land-use categories according to distance from stream channels using a series of buffer zones around each stream, Effects of point source contributions were removed from observed in-stream concentrations so that nonpoint source effects could be more clearly delineated. All models except two were significant at P < 0.05, The models for TOTN (r(2) from 0.25-0.63) explained more variability of stream nutrient concentrations than those for TOTE (r(2) from 0.16-0.39), Greater predictive strength for TOTN than TOTP likely reflects differing pathways from terrestrial to aquatic systems, Land close to the stream channel (<150 m) was a better predictor of nutrient concentrations than land away from the channel (>150 m), Land-use change scenarios (converting forest and wetland to agriculture) support the conclusion that management of stream water quality will be most effective with emphasis on riparian and adjacent lands. Seasonal models were generally significant (P < 0.05) and demonstrate that the seasonal profile of stream nutrient concentrations is dependent on the mosaic of land uses in a specific subbasin.																			0047-2425					JAN-FEB	1998	27	1					100	111		10.2134/jeq1998.00472425002700010015x	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq1998.00472425002700010015x													WOS:000071646800015

Measurements were carried out at six depths for each sampling point. We attempted to describe the behaviors of the two lakes under different natural conditions, in order to identify the impact of anthropogenic activities on the quality parameters of the two lakes. Our studies showed that the qualitative parameters of the water fluctuate as an effect of anthropogenic activities. A comparative analysis of the results gathered during three monitoring campaigns in 2016, 2018, and 2020 indicated that water quality was affected by anthropogenic activities such as mixing water layers which were characterized by different salinity values. The lakes tended to lose basicity, pH values varying between 9 at the surface level and 7 at -4 m. The thermal stratification phenomenon was only evident in the first year of monitoring; later on, the waters of both lakes appeared thermally homogenous down to the depth of -2 m. It was determined that the lakes had an uppermost freshwater layer, which disappeared during the bathing season because of vertical mixing. Interestingly, the two lakes showcased different behaviors at depths beyond -3 m. In addition, the infiltration of meteoric water that was polluted with nitrites and nitrates demonstrated the fact that anthropogenic activities that take place in the vicinity of the lakes generate negative effects on water quality. The presence of the heliothermal phenomenon was confirmed by the measurements made in the upper segment of the lakes. This layer of water consists of a mixture of fresh and salt water. The purpose of the research was to evaluate the water quality of the lakes, monitor its evolution during the bathing season and update the situation regarding the water quality of the two salt lakes by testing specific parameters.					; Micle, Valer/AAC-4725-2019	Simona Elena, Avram/0000-0002-2222-9397; Micle, Valer/0000-0003-1102-4537														2073-4441				AUG	2022	14	15							2366	10.3390/w14152366	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14152366													WOS:000839316600001

Assessment of surface irrigation potential and crop water requirement: the case of Megech watershed, Upper Blue Nile Basin, Ethiopia	SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												For the world's growing population, large improvements in food production are required. The majority of newly irrigated land will come from developing countries. Ethiopia has a substantial agricultural land resource. About 66% of the country's area is potentially appropriate for agriculture, but only 5% of this area has been developed. To examine the fundamental causes of this low level of irrigation development, land suitability for irrigation was estimated using pair-wise comparison matrix methods and arc GIS-based weighted overlay techniques, which consider the collaboration of ten factoring parameters. The results indicated that 5.6% of the area is highly suitable, 68.2% moderately suitable, 26.1 marginal suitable, and 0.1% were unsuitable for surface irrigation. To grow in these identified irrigable areas, seven crops were selected, and their gross irrigation demand was calculated using CROPWAT8.0. The discharges at the site of interest were estimated by transferring the river discharge at the gauged site to the site of interest on the same river using area ratio methods. The surface available flow was determined by generating a flow duration curve at Q-90% minimum flow, the estimated result is 0.044m(3)/s. By associating the gross irrigation demand of irrigable land with the available flow in rivers, the total surface irrigation potential of the study area was obtained as 181 ha. The river flow during the dry season is not sufficient for targeted irrigation sites. As the result revealed that the available dry river flow does not meet the available potential irrigable land, hence the government and decision-makers should plan storage structures that collect flow in the wet season for dry irrigation.

J	Kazantseva, TI; Adamovich, B				Kazantseva, T., I; Adamovich, B., V			Leading Factors of the Dynamics of Lake Ecosystems under a Changing Nutrient Load: Analysis of Long-Term Monitoring Data of Naroch Lakes	CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY												Since the second half of the 1970s, the ecosystems of lakes Batorino, Myastro, and Naroch have undergone anthropogenic eutrophication, targeted deeutrophication, and benthification caused by the introduction of the filter-feeding mollusk Dreissena polymorpha Pallas. The set of continuous series of seasonal mean values of eight parameters of each ecosystem obtained in 1978-2015 have been analyzed by mathematical-statistical methods of principal components (PCA) and singular spectra (SSA). The analysis showed that the complicated long-term dynamics of the set of the chosen parameters of the ecosystems was described during this period of time by three principal components by 92% and 90% for Lake Batorino and Lake Myastro, respectively, and by five principal components by 94% for Lake Naroch. We propose a biological interpretation of these principal components, i.e., a hypothesis of the factors exerting the greatest effect on the ecosystem dynamics during those years. The first main factor, which determines the dynamics of the ecosystems of lakes Batorino, Myastro, and Naroch by 63, 65, and 43%, respectively, is interpreted as the resistance of the lake ecosystem to a variable biogenic load, which is inversely related to the trophicity of the reservoir. The second main factor, which contributes 21, 15, and 22% to the dynamics of the ecosystem parameters of Naroch lakes (in the same order), was interpreted as solar radiation activity. The interpretation of the third main factor depends on the properties of a particular ecosystem. For ecosystems that are not deficient in biogenic elements (lakes Batorino and Myastro, with a contribution of the factor to the ecosystem dynamics of 8 and 10%), this may be the transfer of the primary organic matter to consumers of the next trophic level related to the structure of the food chain in the ecosystem. For an ecosystem in which the process of primary production formation is limited by the available amount of biogenic elements (Lake Naroch, in which the contribution of the third main factor to ecosystem dynamics is 13%), this very factor is the third main one, affecting the ecosystem long-term dynamics. The fourth main factor, which determines the dynamics of the Lake Naroch ecosystem by 9%, is also related to the process of primary production formation. Only the fifth main factor, which determined 7% of the dynamics of the ecosystem of Lake Naroch during the analyzed time period, controls the transfer of primary production to consumers of the first trophic level. Thus, our statistical study not only confirmed empirical regularities of the functioning of lake ecosystems, but for the first time enabled us to obtain quantitative assessments of the importance of each main factor for ecosystem development under specific conditions, depending on the trophicity of the water body.

A total of 944 Palaemon paucidens and 279 Neocaridina spp. were collected, and 203 immature T. chinensis were found attached to the carapace of these hosts. Mean prevalence was 23.1% for P. paucidens and 6.4% for Neocaridina spp. Newly hatched T. chinensis ectoparasitizing P. paucidens were detected in August 2018 (minimum body length of parasite 3.2 mm) and appeared continually until June 2019 (maximum body length of 10.3 mm) and were not observed in July. In contrast, T. chinensis on Neocaridina spp. were first detected in August of each year (with minimum body length of 2.0 mm) and were observed until September in 2018 and to November in 2019 (maximum body length of 5.8 mm). Ratios of the body length of T. chinensis to the carapace length of the host shrimp were almost constant (0.8-0.9) with the host species and parasite growth. Although infestation by early- life-stage individuals of T. chinensis was observed on both shrimp species, P. paucidens appeared to be the principal host for individuals larger than 6 mm in body length.

Diversity, prevalence, and intensity of gastrointestinal helminth infections in migratory, resident, and sedentary plains zebras (Equus quagga) in Masai Mara National Reserve and Lake Nakuru National Park, Kenya	VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY- REGIONAL STUDIES AND REPORTS												The diversity, prevalence and intensity of parasitic infections are influenced by factors such as movement patterns and land area available to the host. Zebras are known to harbour various genera of gastrointestinal helminths and facilitate parasite movement across large geographic areas through migration. Despite the harmful effects of helminths and their consequences on host population dynamics, little is known regarding helminth infection patterns in migratory, resident, and sedentary zebras. This study compared the diversity, prevalence, and intensity of helminth infections in zebras with different host movement patterns and space availability. Faecal samples were collected from migratory, resident, and sedentary groups of zebras between 2014 and 2015 and screened for helminth infection. They were infected by diverse groups of helminths including nematodes, trematodes and cestodes with the most prevalent being strongyle type nematodes. No significant difference in the diversity and prevalence was observed between the "three groups". Larvae were also recovered and identified species, cyathostomes, Strongylus edentatus, S.vulgaris, S. equinus, and Trichostronglus in order of abundance. The intensity of infection with the strongyle type nematodes, was highest in the migratory, then sedentary and lowest in resident zebras. It is plausible that the migratory zebras have higher energy demands and poor nutrition, resulting in reduced immune function hence high nematode burdens. Similarly, the sedentary population had high nematode burdens possibly due to high pasture contamination and depressed immunity due to the artificially restricted movement. The latter observation is particularly important in the design and size of sanctuaries in relation to parasitism.																			2405-9390					AUG	2022	33								100750	10.1016/j.vprsr.2022.100750	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vprsr.2022.100750								35820722					WOS:000819416800003

Restoration of deltaic wetlands in the Williamson River delta, Oregon, is regarded as one strategy that may increase larval nursery habitat and survival. This study examined larval sucker presence, growth, development, and feeding in pilot restoration wetlands at the Williamson River delta to determine whether wetland restoration provides habitat that is conducive to larval rearing. We compared results from the restoration wetlands to those in riparian and lacustrine wetland reference sites during 2003 and 2004. The seasonal timing of larval Lost River and shortnose suckers captured in the restoration wetlands was similar to that in reference sites during the April-July study period. The frequency of occurrence in the restoration wetlands was comparable to that in reference sites; larvae were collected in 90-100% of transects during periods of peak abundance. These data are an indication that restored wetlands provide critical habitat for larval suckers. Larval sucker length, developmental phase, and gut fullness in the restoration wetlands indicated that larvae were feeding, growing, and hence, rearing, in those areas. Water temperatures in the restoration wetlands were 3-4 degrees C higher than those in reference sites, especially early in the season, which may have increased the restoration sites' suitability for larval rearing compared with reference sites. Our results indicate that initial wetland restoration efforts at the Williamson River delta have successfully created suitable rearing habitat for larval Lost River and shortnose suckers and suggest that further large-scale wetland restoration in the delta will increase larval rearing opportunities and contribute to the recovery of these two endangered species.

J	Konter, A				Konter, Andre			Seasonal evolution of colonial breeding in the Great Crested Grebe Podiceps cristatus:: a four years' study at Lake IJssel	ARDEA												A field study at the Dutch IJsselmeer on colonial nesting of Great Crested Grebe Podiceps cristatus over four breeding seasons focused on the phenomenon of breeding aggregation. Grebes settled in two types of habitat: 'Bulrush' and 'Reed'. Pairs in Bulrush nested later in the season, and therefore produced smaller clutches, compared to pairs breeding in Reed. Breeding pairs showed high variability in the timing of arrival, nest building and egg laying ('laying date'). Pairs that started nest building early in the season took more time to produce a clutch. They also produced larger clutches, but experienced more egg loss, compared to pairs breeding later in the season. Corrected for laying date, year and habitat, there was no effect of coloniality as measured by nearest neighhour distance, on clutch size and egg loss. I conclude that colonial breeding in the Great Crested Grebe results from suitable habitat progressively filling-up with breeding pairs, without accruing any reproductive advantages.																			0373-2266	2213-1175				SPR	2008	96	1					13	24		10.5253/078.096.0103	http://dx.doi.org/10.5253/078.096.0103													WOS:000255981800003

Plants consumed by Eulemur fulvus in Comoros Islands (Mayotte) and potential effects on intestinal parasites	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY												The study of self-medication among animals-zoopharmacognosy-is founded on observations that suggest that wild animals use plants with specific biological properties that may be beneficial to them. To verify whether self-vermifugation occurs among Eulemur fulvus in the wild, we studied their feeding behavior in both the dry and humid forests of Mayotte (Comoros Islands). We used the focal individual sampling method over an annual cycle. We conducted a complementary study during the 2-mo mating season, via the scan sampling method (at 10-min intervals). Among the 29 plant species brown lemurs consumed, we tested 16 in vitro as antiparasitic agents on 3 experimental parasite models (Rhabditis pseudoelongata, Trichomonas vaginalis, Entamoeba invadens). We obtained crude extracts to be tested after 2 successive chemical extractions (ethyl acetate and methanol), and 7 of them, belonging to 4 different plant species, showed an antiparasitic property: lemurs consumed Annona squamosa and Mimusops comorensis in large amounts, but ingested Ixora cremixora and Syzygium jambos sporadically. The 4 plants were active on the flagellate but only one of them Ixora cremixora) also demonstrated antinematode properties. Humans use 2 of the plants as intestinal antiparasitic agents in traditional medicine and include numerous other plants in the diet. The relative lake of amoebas and flagellates in stools of Eulemur fulvus may be related to the consumption of plants with antiprotozoal properties. Nevertheless, in the absence of specific behavior that could be linked to a voluntary therapeutic action during our study, self-vermifugation in Eulemur fulvus remains elusive.

J	WISENDEN, BD				WISENDEN, BD			REPRODUCTIVE-BEHAVIOR OF FREE-RANGING CONVICT CICHLIDS, CICHLASOMA-NIGROFASCIATUM	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Cichlids are unusual among fishes because they have prolonged care of their young. Convict cichlids, Cichlasoma nigrofasciatum, are monogamous and have biparental care of their young. This species has been studied extensively in the laboratory, however, little is known of their reproductive habits in nature. Four populations of convict cichlids were studied in Costa Rican streams during the long dry season in 1990 and 1991. Basic physical and chemical parameters of the study sites are described. In the study area breeding fish paired size assortatively; large males with large females and small males with small females. A comparison of the size distribution of breeding fish to that of non-breeding fish showed that small males and in some cases, small females were excluded from breeding. This suggests competition among males for nest sites and mates or female-female competition. Further evidence of intrasexual competition in females is provided by the black colour phase adopted by some females. Some of these females were active in courtship and had mature ova. Cave guarding behaviour and reuse of caves show that a ready-made spawning site is an important resource shaping the mating system of this species. This description of basic natural history can serve as a source of testable hypotheses for future research and allow the results from laboratory studies on this and related species to be interpreted within the ecological context of the natural habitat.																			0378-1909					JUN	1995	43	2					121	134		10.1007/BF00002480	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00002480													WOS:A1995RC89400003

Issues of geologically-focused situational awareness in robotic planetary missions: Lessons from an analogue mission at Mistastin Lake impact structure, Labrador, Canada	ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH												Remote robotic data provides different information than that Obtained from immersion in the field. This significantly affects the geological situational awareness experienced by members of a mission control science team. In order to optimize science return from planetary robotic missions, these limitations must be understood and their effects mitigated to fully leverage the field experience of scientists at mission control. Results from a 13-day analogue deployment at the Mistastin Lake impact structure in Labrador, Canada suggest that scale, relief, geological detail, and time are intertwined issues that impact the mission control science team's effectiveness in interpreting the geology of an area. These issues are evaluated and several mitigation options are suggested. Scale was found to be difficult to interpret without the reference of known objects, even when numerical scale data were available. For this reason, embedding intuitive scale-indicating features into image data is recommended. Since relief is not conveyed in 2D images, both 3D data and observations from multiple angles are required. Furthermore, the 3D data must be observed in animation or as anaglyphs, since without such assistance much of the relief information in 3D data is not communicated. Geological detail may also be missed due to the time required to collect, analyze, and request data. We also suggest that these issues can be addressed, in part, by an improved understanding of the operational time costs and benefits of scientific data collection. Robotic activities operate on inherently slow time-scales. This fact needs to be embraced and accommodated. Instead of focusing too quickly on the details of a target of interest, thereby potentially minimizing science return, time should be allocated at first to more broad data collection at that target, including preliminary surveys, multiple observations from various vantage points, and progressively smaller scale of focus. This operational model more closely follows techniques employed by field geologists and is fundamental to the geologic interpretation of an area. Even so, an operational time cost/benefit analyses should be carefully considered in each situation, to determine when such comprehensive data collection would maximize the science return. Finally, it should be recognized that analogue deployments cannot faithfully model the time scales of robotic planetary missions. Analogue missions are limited by the difficulty and expense of fieldwork. Thus, analogue deployments should focus on smaller aspects of robotic missions and test components in a modular way (e.g., dropping communications constraints, limiting mission scope, focusing on a specific problem, spreading the mission over several field seasons, etc.).

J	Edwards, ME; Bigelow, NH; Finney, BP; Eisner, WR				Edwards, ME; Bigelow, NH; Finney, BP; Eisner, WR			Records of aquatic pollen and sediment properties as indicators of late-Quaternary Alaskan lake levels	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												We investigated whether techniques developed to evaluate qualitative lake-level changes in the temperate zone can be used in sub-arctic and arctic Alaska. We focused on aquatic pollen records and sediment properties (loss-on-ignition and magnetic susceptibility) from centrally-located sediment-surface samples and cores, as these are the most commonly reported data in the literature. Modern aquatic pollen values are generally low (< 5%) and may be zero, even in lakes with abundant aquatic macrophytes. Greater diversity and higher values of aquatic pollen are likely at depths < 5 m, but pollen is found in depths up to 15 m. It is absent at depths > 20 m. Spores of Isoetes and Equisetum and Pediastrum cell-nets, when present, tend to be widely distributed, even in deep water. At Birch Lake, interior Alaska, trends in aquatic taxa and sediment characteristics for the last ca. 12,000 C-14 yrs recorded in a single, deep-water core reflect the same water-level changes as do transect-based lake-level reconstructions - if modern distributional characteristics of pollen and spores are taken into account. The lake rose from extremely low levels at ca. 12,000 C-14 yr B.P. After a period of fluctuation, it rose to a relatively high level by ca. 8000 C-14 yr B.P. and then stabilized. A preliminary survey of aquatic pollen trends from other lake-sediment records suggests that the period ca. 11,000-8000 C-14 yr B.P. may have seen relatively low lake levels in north-western and interior Alaska and high levels thereafter. Changes in aquatic pollen and sediments are evident in north-eastern interior lakes at the same time, but they are more difficult to interpret. Aquatic pollen productivity in Alaskan lakes may partly depend on factors other than water depth (e.g. temperature, pH, nutrient status, or length of the ice-free season). An Alaska-wide reconstruction of late-Quaternary lake levels based on extant single-core data would be best done after further study of contributing factors that may control sediment properties and aquatic pollen distribution.

J	Haertel, SS; Eckmann, R				Haertel, SS; Eckmann, R			Diel diet shift of roach and its implications for the estimation of daily rations	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												In a small, 12 ha, mesotropic lake, roach Rutilus rutilus performed diet habitat shifts that clearly influenced the composition of their diet, During daytime, roach stayed in the littoral zone and concentrated on littoral prey, At night they were found in the pelagic zone, and pelagic prey items such as Daphnia spp. or Chaoborus flavicans dominated their food. On a seasonal scale, there were shifts in the importance of different food items and in the diet pattern of feeding intensity. Bioenergetics modelling in combination with an evacuation rate method for estimating daily rations allowed for changes in feeding modes to be taken into account, and so food item specific daily rations over the season could be determined. With the evacuation rate method applied on selected days, diet changes in diet compositions and feeding intensities could be quantitatively accounted for. When the 24 It integrated diet proportions were then used as an input parameter for bioenergetics modelling, food item specific consumption could he determined over the entire sampling season. The consideration of the diet diet shifts proved to be essential for the model output. If only the daytime or the night-time diet composition (derived from one single daily sampling) was taken into account for bioenergetics modelling, severe under- or overestimations of daily rations for specific food items resulted.

Attributes of Lake Okanagan evaporation and development of a mass transfer model for water management purposes	CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL												Understanding the water budget of the valley lakes in the water-stressed Okanagan region of British Columbia is important for allocating resources to maximize social well-being, environmental quality and the economy. However, high uncertainty in existing estimates of lake evaporation prevents sound water resource decision making. To address this uncertainty, buoy- and shore-based eddy covariance and meteorological instrumentation were deployed on the largest of the valley lakes, Lake Okanagan, for approximately 3 years. The objectives were to address the uncertainty in existing Lake Okanagan evaporation estimates by describing seasonal cycles and annual rates and the meteorological attributes controlling evaporation, and developing an accurate and useful model suitable for water managers and policy makers. Results indicate that two sites on Lake Okanagan experienced average annual evaporation of 725 and 835 mm over the study period. The difference can be attributed to spatial differences in surface water temperatures, vapour pressure gradients and atmospheric stability across the lake. Good relationships were found between evaporation rates measured with the eddy covariance systems and meteorological conditions at the offshore buoys, specifically between wind speed and the surface-atmospheric vapour pressure differences. From these relationships, a mass transfer model was developed. Accounting for the seasonal cycle in atmospheric stability increased the accuracy of monthly and annual evaporation estimates from this mass transfer model, but it remains inappropriate to predict daily or hourly evaporation. The study period included years that were climatically typical, so the evaporation observations could represent values close to the long-term mean, but this is unknown. The findings of this study highlight that long-term observations of the atmosphere consistently conditioned to the lake surface are needed for water managers and decision makers to have sound data and information on lake evaporation.																			0701-1784	1918-1817				JUL 3	2015	40	3					250	261		10.1080/07011784.2015.1046140	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07011784.2015.1046140													WOS:000359758000002

Estimating the extent of drained supraglacial lakes on the Greenland Ice Sheet	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Supraglacial lakes are a common feature of the ablation zone of the Greenland Ice Sheet and have significant implications for the water budget of the area, because when they drain they can increase the speed at which ice moves to lower elevations. One valuable tool in assessing the water balance of ice sheets is to track the volume of lakes as they form, through in situ measurements or by determining lake area and depth from aircraft or spacecraft imagery. However, since supraglacial lakes drain unpredictably and rapidly, it is possible that they can form and drain without being observed. Therefore, it is valuable to create tools that can detect the previous presence of supraglacial lakes after they have drained. Three methods of distinguishing drained supraglacial lakes in Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) satellite imagery and hyperspectral airborne imagery were analysed: spectral signature analysis on raw data, band ratio analysis, and textural analysis. All three methods show promise that they could be used to detect former (i.e. drained) supraglacial lakes, thereby refining estimates of the water balance of the Greenland Ice Sheet and providing valuable data to climate models.

Long-term changes in physical and chemical conditions of nutrient-poor lakes along a latitudinal gradient: is there a coherent phytoplankton community response?	AQUATIC SCIENCES												To evaluate climate and atmospheric deposition induced physical and water chemical changes and their effects on phytoplankton communities, we used complete time series (14 years, monthly measurements during the growing season) of 18 physical and chemical variables and phytoplankton data from 13 nutrient-poor Swedish reference lakes along a latitudinal gradient. We found numerous strong significant changes over time that were most coherent among lakes for sulfate concentrations, conductivity, calcium, magnesium, chloride, potassium, water color, surface water temperature and the intensity of thermal stratification. Despite these pronounced coherent physical and water chemical changes over Sweden, the phytoplankton biomass and species richness of six phytoplankton groups, measured at the same time as the water chemical variables, showed only few and weak significant changes over time. The only coherent significant change over Sweden, occurring in seven lakes, was observed in the species richness of chlorophytes. The number of chlorophyte taxa significantly declined over Sweden. Using a partial least square model for each lake, we attributed the decline primarily to an increase in water temperatures and water color, which were among the most important variables for the model performance of each lake. All other taxonomic groups were driven primarily by non-coherent changes in nutrient concentrations, pH and probably also non-coherent grazing pressure. We concluded that coherent phytoplankton responses can only be achieved for taxonomic groups that are driven primarily by coherent physical/chemical changes. According to our study, chlorophytes belong to such a group, making them possible global change indicators. Our findings give new insights into global change effects on different phytoplankton taxonomic groups in nutrient-poor lakes.

Mean crustacean biomass over the period 2003-2004 was 0.99 g C m(-2). The seasonal dynamics closely followed variations of chlorophyll a concentration and responded well to the dry season phytoplankton peak. The mean annual crustacean production rate was 23 g C m(-2) year(-1). The mean trophic transfer ef fi ciency between phytoplankton and herbivorous zooplankton was equal to 6.8%, indicating a coupling between both trophic levels similar to that in other East African Great lakes. These observations suggest a predominant bottom- up control of plankton dynamics and biomass in Lake Kivu. Whereas the present biomass of crustacean plankton in Lake Kivu is comparable to that of other African Rift lakes, the zooplankton biomass before Limnothrissa introduction was 2.6 g C m(-2), based on estimation from available historical data. So, if the sardine introduction in the middle of the last century led to a threefold decrease of zooplankton biomass, it did not affect zooplankton production to a level which would lead to the collapse of the food web and of the fi shery.

Water quality improvement has become an urgent priority in water resource management. As "the kidneys of earth," wetlands have been widely used in pollution control. To make the wetland play a better role in reducing pollution, various methods have been developed in recent years, especially wetland networks. Major factors influencing the functions of wetland are wetland categories, wetland area, wetland site and wetland hydrology, which are sometimes related to flood and dry seasons. Using wetland networks to improve water quality is an important and urgent work for environment protection, and also provides a useful method for water managers. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B. V.

J	Huchzermeyer, KDA				Huchzermeyer, K. David A.			Prevalence of pansteatitis in African sharptooth catfish, Clarias gariepinus (Burchell), in the Kruger National Park, South Africa	JOURNAL OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN VETERINARY ASSOCIATION												Pansteatitis was confirmed in sharptooth catfish, Clarias gariepinus (Burchell), from three main locations within the Kruger National Park (KNP); the Olifants River Gorge, Engelhard Dam on the Letaba River and from the Sabie River in the Sabiepoort. An increasing prevalence of pansteatitis was observed in catfish during repeated samplings from the Olifants Gorge from 2009 to 2011 and co-existence of old and recent lesions indicated on-going incitement of pansteatitis. Only a low prevalence of pansteatitis was observed in catfish sampled from the Olifants River upstream of the Gorge in the KNP and no pansteatitis was observed in catfish sampled from a rain-filled dam not connected to the Olifants River. Common to both the Olifants Gorge and the Sabiepoort is the damming of the rivers in Mozambique to form lakes Massingir and Corumana respectively. Anthropogenic activities resulting in potential pollution of the rivers differ greatly between these two catchments, providing argument against a primary pollution-related aetiology of the pansteatitis found at these two sites. Compared with other sites, analysis of stomach contents of catfish from the Olifants Gorge and the Sabiepoort strongly suggested that consumption of a predominantly fish diet was associated with the development of pansteatitis in these fish. In a farmed population of catfish used as positive control, development of pansteatitis could be ascribed to consumption of rancid fish waste from a trout slaughterhouse. In the Olifants Gorge, alien invasive silver carp, Hypophthalmychthys molitrix (Valenciennes), seasonally migrate upstream out of Lake Massingir to spawn. This schooling species is an obligate phytoplankton feeder with consequent high levels of adipose tissue n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. In the Olifants Gorge, at least, this may explain seasonal exposure to levels of polyunsaturated fats in the diets of catfish and crocodiles to which these animals are not adapted. The possible roles of diet, membrane lipid composition and metabolic rate of fish, sediment pollution and seasonal drop in environmental temperature in the pathogenesis of pansteatitis in the catfish are discussed. Further studies are needed to verify some of these speculations.																			1019-9128	2224-9435					2012	83	1							916	10.4102/jsava.v83i1.916	http://dx.doi.org/10.4102/jsava.v83i1.916								23327137					WOS:000324805100026

Nitrogen-15 Isotope Enrichment in Benthic Boundary Layer Gases of a Stratified Eutrophic Iron and Manganese Rich Lake	AQUATIC GEOCHEMISTRY												The applicability of the natural abundance of nitrogen gas isotope ratios was used to indicate the spatial distribution of nitrogen transformations in the water column and sediment pore waters of Lake Ngapouri, a small (area 0.19 km(2)), monomictic, eutrophic lake in the Taupo Volcanic Zone, North Island, New Zealand. Samples were collected from the epilimnion, hypolimnion, benthic boundary layer and at 5-cm intervals from the sediment pore waters at monthly intervals for 1 year. Values of delta N-15 [N-2] ranged from -1 to 0.28aEuro degrees in the epilimnion, -1.5 to 1.25aEuro degrees in the hypolimnion, -1.8 to 12.2aEuro degrees in the benthic boundary layer and -0.7 to 3.5aEuro degrees in sediment pore waters. Values of delta N-15 [N-2] showed a strong seasonal pattern that was related to the loss of dissolved oxygen in the hypolimnion during seasonal stratification. Increases in N-15-enriched dinitrogen take place in the benthic boundary layer during the periods of anoxia (taken to be dissolved oxygen concentrations < 6.3 mu M) and may be related to abundant ammonium substrate (up to 275 mu M) to support denitrification. Nitrate concentrations increased up to 36 mu M with increasing duration of anoxia. We hypothesise that an alternative electron acceptor besides oxygen is required to support the nitrification needed for the production of nitrate. Iron and manganese hydroxides and oxides from material sedimenting out of the water column may have induced chemo-nitrification sufficient to oxidise ammonium in the anoxic benthic boundary layer. The nitrate formed would mostly be rapidly denitrified so that the delta N-15 [N-2] would continue to become enriched during the presence of anoxia, as observed in hypolimnion and benthic boundary layer of Lake Ngapouri. The changes in delta N-15 [N-2] values indicate the potential use of isotope ratios to identify and quantify potential chemo-nitrification/denitrification in the water column and sediment pore waters of lakes.

J	Wang, ZC; Li, DH; Li, ZJ				Wang, Zhicong; Li, Dunhai; Li, Zhongjie			RAINFALLS ACCELERATE THE DECLINE PROCESS OF MICROCYSTIS (CYANOPHYCEAE) BLOOMS	FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN												In Lake Chaohu, China, a vertical stratification of water temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO) was observed on sunny days, whereas it was not obvious on rainy days and DO was low in the whole water body. This indicates that rainfall can lead to a vertical convection and a low DO. In this study, we found that the density of small Microcystis colonies (<100 mu m) was higher on rainy day than on sunny days, implying that rainfall had a mechanical impact on large colonies and broke them into small colonies. The measured results of algae collected on sunny day showed that oxygen removal in mucilaginous envelope, mechanical damage, and destruction of gas vesicles could significantly decrease the buoyancy of Microcystis colonies by 27.36 +/- 4.85% (p < 0.01), 45.57 +/- 5.29% (p < 0.01) and 18.23 +/- 3.24% (p < 0.05) in one-way ANOVA, respectively. However, when algae sampled on rainy day were treated with above mentioned three methods, the buoyancy of Microcystis colonies only decreased by 6.72 +/- 2.77% (p > 0.05), 33.37 +/- 4.02% (p < 0.01), and 13.34 +/- 3.58% (p < 0.05) in one-way ANOVA, respectively. These results suggested the rapid decrease in colony buoyancy on rainy days was not only due to the breakage of colonies but also due to the loss of oxygen bubble entrapped in mucilaginous envelope. Under simulated rainy day condition, the low DO in the water significantly decreased the photosynthetic activity, the up-floating velocity, and the growth rate of Microcystis colonies, which suggested that low-oxygen in some areas of lake could damage the photo-system of Microcystis and cause a bloom decline. The reculture of settled Microcystis colonies collected on rainy days showed that the recovery of photosynthetic activity and growth rate were very low, suggesting that most of the settled colonies could not act as seed source for the next bloom even though they were stirred and suspended in the water column after the weather conditions became suitable. Therefore, the physiological inactivity and the settling of Microcystis colonies under frequent heavy rainfall condition are the important reasons for the seasonal, rapid, irreversible collapse of severe algal blooms until the following year.

Since the late 1960s and early 1970s, when the species was at very low population levels, the Double-crested Cormorant has rebounded to its greatest population level in over 100 years. Such a significant increase has resulted in changes in community structure, and new stressors, in many aquatic ecosystems. Both Special Publications (1995 and 2013) have been focused on the biology and management of the species. The first volume dealt mainly with population growth and the resulting, immediate management issues. In the current volume, studies address the longer term situation, the implementation of two U.S. depredation orders and new research directions identified in the first Special Publication and in subsequent smaller cormorant symposia. Seventeen papers which comprise this volume are presented under six headings: introduction, impacts to natural resources, population dynamics, evaluation of control efforts, assessing fish consumption and bioenergetics, migration ecology and local and seasonal movements, and summary overview and future information needs. A second Special Publication on Double-crested Cormorants gives us an opportunity to assess how well cormorant biologists have addressed and answered questions we posed to ourselves 15 years earlier; it also provides us with a vision for the next 18 years.

The technical sodium pentachlorophenate (Na-PCP) was widely used during the period between the early 1960s and early 1990s to kill oncomelania, the intermediate host of Schistosomes. However, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) also contaminated the environment of Dongting Lake due to trace impurities of Na-PCP. In this study, 13 species of freshwater fish were collected from Dongting Lake and analyzed in wet and dry seasons. Temporal (wet and dry season) variations in PCDD/Fs in fishes from Dongting Lake were observed. The concentration of PCDD/Fs was considerably higher in the wet season than in the dry season and in areas in China where Na-PCP was not applied. The higher level of PCDD/Fs in the wet season may be attributed to the use of Na-PCP in the past and to the increase in the migration of PCDD/Fs from sediments to water in the wet season. The results indicate that the risk of PCDD/Fs contamination is connected with prior consumption of fishes that live in the Na-PCP application area. However, there was no difference in the concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) between the wet and dry seasons.					chen, bo/AAC-7188-2022; li, jingguang/JPL-5894-2023; Wu, Yongning/F-5818-2019	Wu, Yongning/0000-0001-6430-1302; Chen, Bo/0000-0002-9926-4377													0167-6369	1573-2959				APR	2018	190	4							232	10.1007/s10661-018-6533-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-018-6533-6								29556731					WOS:000429054600006

The freshwater crayfish were sampled 584 individual as seasonally from Egirdir Lake. Ten male and 10 female individuals were sampled randomly from caught crayfish in each two different size ranges (4.5-7.0, 7.1-9.9 cm) and each season. The gastrointestinal tract, gastric, intestine and midgut gland were individually dissected on ice for enzyme analysis and stomach contents. At the end of the study, amylase activities were affected by interaction of season x sex x size in intestinal, season x sex in midgut gland. However, any interaction was not determined in amylase activities of the gastric. Lipase activities were affected by interaction of season x sex x size in intestinal and gastric, season x sex in midgut gland. The protease activities in each organ were affected by interaction of season, sex and size (p < .05). In all organs, amylase and lipase activities were similar. However, the highest protease activity was in stomach while the lowest protease activity was the intestine. The protease activities were higher than amylase and lipase activities. There is a positive correlation between protease enzyme activities in gastric with gonad maturation and active feeding period. It can be said based on data of digestive system and high protease activity that A. leptodactylus is an omnivore species in need high protein. In addition, the reason for the low levels of lipase activity may be A. leptodactylus not prefer high fat foods or not fed high fat foods.

Using Benthic Indicator Species and Community Gradients to Optimize Restoration in the Arid, Endorheic Walker River Watershed, Western USA	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												The challenge of restoring watersheds in arid regions often requires the development of novel scientific tools to guide management. The Walker Basin Program was created to reverse ecological decline in an arid, endorheic watershed through scientifically guided restoration. As part of this programme, 3years of benthic macroinvertebrate samples were collected seasonally at 10 sites that represent the diversity of river environments from the high-mountain headwaters to a desert terminal lake. Samples were analysed to quantify baseline conditions in reference and degraded reaches of river and identify opportunities and constraints for aquatic community restoration. Naturally harsh environments in the lower river characterized by high temperatures and low base flow combined with a weak understanding of reference conditions to limit the utility of commonly used indices for quantifying biotic integrity. A flexible approach was employed using a combination of indicator species analysis, cluster analysis, canonical correspondence analysis, and community tolerance indices to evaluate the variation of benthic macroinvertebrate community composition across a set of environmental gradients. Results demonstrate that benthic communities in the watershed are primarily influenced by a longitudinal gradient related to elevation. A strong secondary community gradient caused by anthropogenic nutrient loading may constrain restoration effectiveness in some parts of the watershed. Restoration activities should improve water quality conditions and initially target areas of the watershed less affected by nutrient loading. Results also demonstrate that benthic communities shift longitudinally. These shifts should be monitored to inform adaptive management of restoration actions.

A bottom sediment sequence that formed in the period of 1885-2013 was investigated with a year/season time resolution using X-ray fluorescence with synchrotron radiation and conventional analysis. A depth-age model of the core was based on counting of the annual laminae. The model was checked by an analysis of the distribution of activity of Pb-210, Cs-137, U-238, and Ra-226. The dynamics of the glacier is considered through the intensity of clastic material inflow into the lake with the glacier melt water. In the elemental composition of the sediments, there are three groups of elements that reflect the periods of movement of the front edge of the glacier and the intensity of development of the aquatic biota. The first group of elements (Ca, K, Ti, Fe, and Mn) characterizes the inflow of clastic material when there are no significant changes in the boundaries of the glacier. The second group of elements (Ni, Cu, Br, and U) reflects the aquatic biota intensity. The third group of elements (Rb, Sr, Zr, Nb, Y, and Th) is some evidence that the displacement of the front edge of the glacier was significant. The glacier retreated rapidly in 1947-1970. The next period of steady degradation of the glacier took place in 1980-2000. Since 2000, the melting rate has slowed down. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

These deposits are interpreted as the sedimentary infill of shallow temporary lakes that were generated by slow growing episodes of alluvial fans that obstructed the Jachal River Valley. The association of fossil remains through the Holocene sedimentary sequence suggests that the accumulation of lacustrine sediments was affected by climate variations. The predominant aridity was punctuated by very few humid episodes characterised by fresh-water gastropoda and the intercalations of muddy sediments. The high proportion of charcoal particles in some samples indicates periodic forest fires. Abundant non-pollen forest remains suggest that an open zone dominated by several types of grasses underwent a dry season during part of the year. The palynomorph associations found in the Jachal River Valley Holocene lacustrine sediments suggest that the humid conditions were less intense than those in the San Juan River Valley located more than one hundred kilometres southwards. Our study suggests that lake formation could have been controlled by climate oscillation probably related to the ENSO variation at 30 degrees south latitude. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Modeling Temporal Trends in Aphid Vector Dispersal and Cucumber Mosaic Virus Epidemics in Snap Bean	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) has become a major limiting factor in snap bean production in the Great Lakes region of North America, and epidemics have occurred more frequently since the soybean aphid, Aphis glycines Matsumura, was introduced. Major aphid vectors of CMV epidemics were identified by statistically relating their temporal dispersal trends to the incidence of CMV. Alates were monitored weekly using water pan traps in 74 snap bean fields in New York and Pennsylvania from 2002 to 2006. Plants were tested for CMV by ELISA one time during late bloom in 2002 and 2003 and weekly over the season from 2004 to 2006. Principal vectors of CMV included Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris), A. glycines, Aphis gossypii Glover, and Therioaphis trifolii (Monell). Among these, A. glycines and T trifolii were likely responsible for severe CMV epidemics because they were among the most abundant species captured, they efficiently transmit CMV, and their dispersal activity was positively correlated with periods when CMV incidence was highest. Moreover, because high numbers of A. glycines and T trifolii disperse during July and August, snap bean fields planted beyond late June are at risk for infection during early vegetative stages and are subsequently more at risk for yield loss. In contrast, plantings up to late June are less likely to become infected during early developmental stages and should escape yield loss because major vectors are dispersing infrequently. CMV-resistant or tolerant snap bean varieties should be planted after late June to reduce the risk of yield loss.					; Shah, Denis/B-1885-2013; Fleischer, Shelby/AAN-1392-2020	Shah, Denis/0000-0002-4551-2216; 													0046-225X	1938-2936				OCT	2009	38	5					1347	1359		10.1603/022.038.0501	http://dx.doi.org/10.1603/022.038.0501								19825288					WOS:000270610000001
J	Montroy, DL				Montroy, DL			Linear relation of central and eastern North American precipitation to tropical Pacific Sea surface temperature anomalies	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												In past research the Southern Oscillation index has often been used as an indicator of the tropical Pacific climate, notably for El Nino and La Nina event occurrences. This study identifies calendar monthly teleconnection signals in central and eastern North American precipitation associated with an alternative tropical Pacific indicator, sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) patterns. Using an approximate 1 degrees resolution set of monthly precipitation totals for 1950-92, the work identifies monthly teleconnection relationships and their intraseasonal evolution. This builds upon previous studies that were limited to seasonal timescales. Here, a unique two-way statistical analysis is used to delineate linear SSTA-precipitation teleconnection patterns. First, a principal component analysis (PCA) is performed on a monthly tropical Pacific SSTA dataset for 1950-92 to identify the coherent modes of variability. The principal component (PC) score time series representing the most significant modes of SSTA variability (see below) are then correlated on a calendar-monthly basis with station precipitation anomalies, yielding associated ''correlation-based'' precipitation coherencies. In the second approach, PCA is applied to the precipitation anomaly data for each calendar month. Then, the resulting ''PC-based'' precipitation coherencies most central to each of the major correlation-based precipitation regions are identified, and their associated PC score time series are subsequently correlated with the tropical Pacific SSTA grid-cell data, yielding correlation-based SSTA coherencies that are then compared (generally favorably) with their PC-based forerunners. The three SSTA PC patterns used to seek teleconnection signals in central and eastern North American precipitation are the first unrotated PC (UPC1, emphasizing central tropical Pacific variability), and the first (VPC1, eastern tropical Pacific) and second (VPC2, western to north central tropical Pacific) Varimax-rotated PCs. The strongest such signals to emerge were for precipitation in the southeastern United States (positive association with UPC1 and VPC1 in November-March), Texas (positive association with UPC1 and VPC1 in November-March), the Great Lakes/Ohio River region (negative association with UPC1 and VPC1 in January-March), the southeastern United States (negative association with UPC1 and VPC1 in July-August), the southern Canadian prairie (negative association with UPC1 and VPC1 in November-January),and along a northern storm track (positive association with VPC2 in September-October). These results, derived from new datasets using a unique statistical approach, both broadly confirm and significantly clarify previous findings and present striking new associations.																			0894-8755					APR	1997	10	4					541	558		10.1175/1520-0442(1997)010<0541:LROCAE>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0442(1997)010<0541:LROCAE>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1997WV71800001

Spatial patterns of zooplanktivore Chirostoma species (Atherinopsidae) during water-level fluctuation in the shallow tropical Lake Chapala, Mexico: seasonal and interannual analysis	NEOTROPICAL ICHTHYOLOGY												This study addresses the influence of water-level fluctuations on fish distribution at two temporal scales: seasonal (dry and rainy) and interannual (low and high volume conditions). The analysis of abundance relationships among three zooplanktivore Chirostoma species at fifteen sites in Lake Chapala, Mexico, revealed the significant influence of contrasting conditions (P=0.0002). Seasonally, segregation was more related to species dominance in the dry season and exclusively related to environmental characteristics in the rainy season. Interanually, biotic influence occurred in the shallowest and the deepest episodes of the lake. Environmental characteristics influenced species distribution when the lake reached 25% of its volume. Site, depth, temperature, and salinity were the leading factors influencing fish distribution. These results emphasize the necessity to implement different management strategies according to lake volume, particularly when a critical threshold is reached.

J	Stockwell, JD; Johannsson, OE				Stockwell, JD; Johannsson, OE			Temperature-dependent allometric models to estimate zooplankton production in temperate freshwater lakes	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Empirical relationships between body size and temperature, and daily PIE of temperate freshwater zooplankton species were derived from the literature. Body size explained 81% of the variation in daily PIE of zooplankton at temperatures less than or equal to 10 degrees C and 48% at temperatures >10 degrees C. The two relationships did not differ in slope but significantly differed in elevation. The regression models were then applied to zooplankton samples collected from a midlake station in Lake Ontario to predict zooplankton seasonal production. Production estimates from the regression models, when compared with estimates from the egg ratio method for the same data set, were similar for cladoceran species, four and 10 times higher for two copepod species, and two times higher for total zooplankton production. In general, these differences are within the range expected based on previous studies that compared different production models. The regression models can provide quick, independent estimates of zooplankton production to complement estimates based on traditional, species-specific methods. Furthermore, the models can be used in conjunction with automated synoptic instruments, such as optical plankton counters and temperature probes, to provide production estimates that better represent large, complex systems such as the Great Lakes.

The MITgcm has not been rigorously validated for closed basins against field observations. Thus, qualitative and quantitative methods were used to validate the model and study the sensitivity to different model parameters against observed temperature data. The linear equation of state (EoS) yielded poor results, in comparison to the polynomial EoS formulations where the density gradient was large. The vertical density stratification was strongly sensitive to the background vertical viscosity and diffusivity (when > 10(-5) m(2)s(-1)), because the prescribed background values control mixing in the KPP scheme, except on the surface and bottom boundary layers. After calibration, the model correctly simulated the vertical stratification, upwelling, basin-scale seiche (with a horizontal mode-one period T-1 = 80 h) and surge formation with a basin-wide root-mean-square-error 1.9 degrees C. Flow visualization indicated that internal surges evolved due to (i) a wind-induced locally downwelled thermocline (wind duration < T-1/4), (ii) a basin-scale wind-induced upwelled thermocline (wind duration > T-1/4) and (iii) internal hydraulic jumps.					; Schweitzer, Seth/AAL-7306-2021	Schweitzer, Seth/0000-0002-9702-4337; 													1567-7419	1573-1510				OCT	2023	23	5			SI		1167	1192		10.1007/s10652-022-09868-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10652-022-09868-z		JUL 2022											WOS:000826133400001
J	Báldi, A				Báldi, A			Area requirements of passerine birds in the reed Archipelago of Lake Velence, Hungary	ACTA ZOOLOGICA ACADEMIAE SCIENTIARUM HUNGARICAE												I studied the area requirement of reedbed breeding passerine birds on 109 reed islands in Lake Velence, Hungary, in the breeding seasons of 1993 and 1994. The size of the smallest occupied reed island for the observed 8 passerine bird species varied from 0.02 ha (Savi's Warbler Locustella luscinioides) to 4.14 ha (Bluethroat Luscinia svecica). Three species occupied reed islands which were 8-18 times larger than their territory sizes (Sedge Warbler Acrocephalus schoenobaenus, Moustached Warbler A. melanopogon, and Bluethroat), three species occurred on reed islands 4-4.5 times larger than territory sizes (Great Reed Warbler A. arundinaceus, Reed Warbler A. scirpaceus, and Reed Bunting Emberiza schoeniclus), and two species occurred on islands half the size of their territory sizes in continuous reedbeds (Bearded Tit Panurus biarmicus, Savi's Warbler). This may suggest that the latter two species can utilise groups of small patches within a territory. The incidence functions showed that the probability of occurrence of the Moustached Warbler and the Bluethroat was not 1 even on the largest reed islands (7-25.7 ha), while it was 1 for the other 6 species. The importance of landscape matrix type in determining minimum area requirements was demonstrated using data on the occurrence of bird species in reed marshes within an agricultural landscape in the Po Plain (Italy). In this landscape much larger minimum areas were found than at Lake Velence.

Three sampling stations were selected, each station reflecting a specific sedimentary environment, benthic communities, and water depth. During this study the phytoplankton density was low. Spatial and seasonal variations of bottom DO concentration and DO flux have been observed during this study. The oxygen consumption rate at all study sites had a mean of -89 (+/-44) mmol m(-2) d(-1) while the oxygen production rate due to benthic algae had a mean of 131 (+/- 103) mmol m(-2) d(-1). There was a strong correlation (r = 0.91) between oxygen consumption rate and temperature. This was presumably because of the temperature influence on rates of microbial and macrobenthic processes. The mean benthic primary production rate at all study sites was 1216 (+/-957) mg C m(-2) d(-1) between June 2000 and February 2001. Annual gross benthic primary production was estimated from the gross mean daily benthic DO production ( P) and Redfield's C:O-2 ratio of 106:138 to be 420 g C m(-2) y(-1) at station HO, 250 g C m(-2) y(-1) at B2 and 340 g C m(-2) y(-1) at station 95. Thus, the mean gross benthic primary production was estimated as 1151 mg C m(-2) d(-1) at station HO, 685 mg C m(-2) d(-1) at station B2, and 932 mg C m(-2) d(-1) at station 95.																			1386-2588	1573-5125					2004	38	2					177	189		10.1023/B:AECO.0000032057.95464.ad	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:AECO.0000032057.95464.ad													WOS:000222064400007
J	Guèye, M; Kantoussan, J; Tine, M				Gueye, Moussa; Kantoussan, Justin; Tine, Mbaye			The impact of environmental degradation on reproduction of the black-chinned tilapia Sarotherodon melanotheron from various coastal marine, estuarine and freshwater habitats	COMPTES RENDUS BIOLOGIES												There is growing evidence that climate change has greatly altered environmental conditions in many aquatic ecosystems over the last decades, leading to changes in fish distribution and life history traits. Recent works conducted in Senegalese and Gambian coastal marine, estuarine and freshwater ecosystems have shown important changes in the intensity, frequency and breeding timing of wild population of Sarotherodon melanotheron in response to changes in salinity regimes. In addition to salinity, this study investigates the potential influences of other environmental factors that have received less attention on the reproduction of S. melanotheron from three different aquatic ecosystems in Senegal. The results demonstrate that day-length and temperature affect sexual maturity in both males and females from Guiers Lake and Hann Bay, but no such effects were found in upstream of the Saloum Estuary, where the spawning activity seems to be under the synergetic control of rainfall and salinity that apparently predominate over all the other ambient factors. This study demonstrated for the first time that aside from photoperiod and temperature, rainfall also influences fish reproduction in Hann Bay probably through its effects on water quality. Furthermore, our results confirm previous findings that changes in salinity regimes resulting from seasonal variations in precipitation and evaporation are the ultimate causes of temporal changes in the reproductive activity of the species in this estuary.

The development of ovary and testis was separated into 5 stages by the criteria. The ratio of females to males increased with total length. Females were sampled in slightly larger size and greater number. Mean size and age was greater for females (255 mm total length and 2.03 years, respectively) than males (227 mm and 2.44 years, respectively). Growth was described by 3 parameter von Bertalanffy model by otoliths as L-t = 459.01(1-exp[-0.126(t+0.416)]). The spawning season of M. salmoides was from April to June, with a peak in May by the gonadosomatic indices and the monthly proportions of female and male gonad stages. Ripe females were collected during the spawning period. Mean fecundity was 27656 +/- 1424 oocytes every female. Fecundity was positively correlated with total length, and it was described by mean fecundity 202.4 Total length - 38188. Higher fecundity well indicated that the largemouth bass has a flexible spawning strategy and has acclimatized well to Goe-san Lake.																			0254-8704					JUL	2013	34	4					747	754											24640252					WOS:000321481500013
J	PACE, ML; COLE, JJ				PACE, ML; COLE, JJ			COMPARATIVE AND EXPERIMENTAL APPROACHES TO TOP-DOWN AND BOTTOM-UP REGULATION OF BACTERIA	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												The regulation of bacterial community biomass and productivity by resources and predators is a central concern in the study of microbial food webs. Resource or bottom-up regulation refers to the limitation of bacteria by carbon and nutrients derived from allocthonous inputs, primary production, and heterotrophic production. Predatory or top-down regulation refers to the limitation of bacteria below levels supportable by resources alone. Large scale comparative studies demonstrate strong correlations between bacterial productivity and biomass, suggesting significant resource regulation. Comparisons of the abundances of heterotrophic flagellates and bacteria, however, imply that in some cases there may be top-down regulation of bacteria in eutrophic environments. Experimental studies in lakes support the importance of resource regulation and reveal little top-down control from protozoans. Increases in bacterial abundance and production with nutrient enrichment were limited in enclosure experiments with high abundances of the cladoceran, Daphnia. Regulation of bacteria by Daphnia may occur in many lakes seasonally and prevail in some lakes throughout the year where these animals sustain dense populations. In most situations, however, bacteria appear to be limited primarily by resources.					; Cole, Jonathan/G-4566-2011	Pace, Michael/0000-0001-5945-6131; 													0095-3628					SEP-OCT	1994	28	2					181	193		10.1007/BF00166807	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00166807								24186444					WOS:A1994PN36200010

In this study, we evaluate the influence of land use on the genetic and biochemical biomarkers of fish in streams of Brazilian savanna (Cerrado). We also evaluated whether biomarker responses are seasonally consistent. For this purpose, individuals of the Neotropical tetra fish Astyanax lacustris were exposed in cages for 96 h, in 13 streams draining agroecosystems with different degrees of disturbance during the dry and wet seasons. After exposure, blood, liver, and gills were collected for multibiomarker analyses (micronuclei, erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities, lipid peroxidation, antioxidant enzymes, and biotransformation enzyme). The results showed that the gradient of anthropic disturbance was positively associated with genotoxic damage (erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities) and negatively associated with antioxidant and biotransformation enzymes of the liver in both seasons. No association of the gradient of anthropic disturbance with the frequency of micronuclei and for most gill enzymes was found for both seasons. Landscape disturbance was also negatively associated with water quality in the wet season. These results indicate that changes in land use interfere with the genetic and biochemical processes of organisms. Thus, the multibiomarker approach may represent an effective strategy for assessing and monitoring terrestrial landscape disturbance.

Bubbles suspended in shallow ice in 20 lakes were observed as part of the operations of the 45th Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition in ice-free rocky areas along the eastern coast of Lutzow-Holm Bay (Syowa Oasis) in East Antarctica in 2004. Anomalous methane concentrations in bubbles suspended in lake ice and anomalous dissolved methane concentrations in lake water were frequently found. Methane concentrations in bubbles varied of 5 orders of magnitude, from 1.9 ppmv to 18% vol/vol. A procedure that makes estimations of methane flux from ice bubbles possible has been developed, on the basis of a relationship between bubble-density distribution, brightness observed by digital photographs, and methane concentration in bubbles. Such a procedure applied to Lake Oyako Ike in the Skarvsnes area, where the maximum methane concentration was observed, suggests that total bubble volume is about 0.6% of ice volume and the mass of methane in bubbles in the lake is about 74 kg. Almost all gases in bubbles are released to the atmosphere in the early ice melt season (a period of a few weeks in December and January). By applying area fraction frequency distributions to methane concentration ranges for 20 lakes surveyed, extrapolation to the whole Syowa Oasis, including 110 lakes, would give a provisional estimate of total emission of about 2 tons-CH4/yr.

Temporal variation in the spatial aggregation of the freshwater bivalve Elliptio complanata was studied at a sandy site in an oligotrophic lake over three years. 2. Epibenthic populations varied in aggregation over the season bringing animals closer together during spawning. The complex link between movements of mussels and aggregation dynamics suggested a functional reproductive role for horizontal locomotion of unionid mussels in lentic systems. 3. The rate of locomotion did not differ systematically among males, females or hermaphrodites, and was independent of gravidity, whether compared during spawning, after spawning or throughout the ice-free season. 4. In spite of the high reproductive output of mussels and the energetic cost of locomotion, no relationship was found between the rate of movement of spawning gravid mussels and reproductive output.

J	Schaller, T; Moor, HC; Wehrli, B				Schaller, T; Moor, HC; Wehrli, B			Sedimentary profiles of Fe, Mn, V, Cr, As and Mo as indicators of benthic redox conditions in Baldeggersee	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Concentration profiles of Mg, K, La, Fe, Mn, V, Cr, As and Mo were determined in samples from a freeze core taken at the deepest site of Baldeggersee in 1993. The special coring technique allowed an exact dating of the sediment samples and an annual resolution of the profiles. Long term changes in benthic redox conditions produce diagnostic trends in several metal profiles. Fe, As and Mn enrichments trace the onset of anoxia at the deepest site of the lake. High values of Mo concentrations and Cr/V ratios indicate periods of stable anoxic conditions in a meromictic hypolimnion. A comparison of oxygen time series with metal profiles between 1950 and 1990 indicates that Mn reacts sensitively to large seasonal variations of deep-water oxygen concentrations.

Because data could not be transformed to meet the assumption of normal distribution, distance matrices were constructed from vectors of observed chlorophyll-a (CHL), photosynthetic active radiation intensity (PAR), soluble reactive phosphorous (SRP), dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), dissolved oxygen (DO), water density (DEN), and incremental change in water density/depth (DEL). Multiple regression analyses then were based on permutation evaluations of the relationships between distance matrices (partial Mantel analyses). Results indicated that resource availability (PAR and DIN) was most frequently related to chlorophyll-a, although DEN and DEL often were significant within individual lakes. Hence, resource relationships were strongest across lakes and seasons whereas density relationships also were important within individual lakes. Moreover, DCM appeared sensitive to threshold levels of DEN and PAR, suggesting that controls may exist as both discrete (threshold) and continuous functions of both resource availability and water density.

Impact of terrestrial carbon input on methane emissions from an Alaskan Arctic lake	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Arctic warming is expected to increase thermokarst erosion in thaw lakes, thus inducing large emissions of CH4 to the atmosphere. To reduce uncertainties about the mechanisms, magnitude and timing of methane emissions, we conducted an in-situ experiment to simulate lake expansion following thermokarst erosion. Three tundra horizons were excavated, incubated at the bottom of a thaw lake and subsequently monitored for CH4 ebullition from mid-season until lake freeze-up. Although the permafrost and seasonally frozen active layer emitted little CH4 throughout the experiment, ebullition from the thawed active layer began the first week, quickly reaching rates ( 39 mg CH4 m(-2) day(-1)) comparable to background ebullition in Siberian thaw lakes. While the long-term fate of permafrost carbon from thermokarst lake expansion remains uncertain, the short-term methane release is dominated by upper active layer carbon. Thus, deepening of the upper active layer in a thaw lake dominated landscape should increase CH4 ebullition rates. Citation: Mazeas, O., J. C. von Fischer, and R. C.

Rivera			RETRACTED: Pastoral Paleoclimate Palimpsests of the South-Central Andes: High-Altitude Herder Dwellings in the 2nd Millennium a.d. (Retracted Article)	JOURNAL OF FIELD ARCHAEOLOGY												Past and present high-altitude pastoralists are often considered remote and marginal to complex societies and socioeconomic systems. Seasonal transhumance and long-distance caravanning cause herders to make their temporary homes in inter-nodal high-altitude regions, "spaces between" that fuel and funnel people, resources, and ideas between nodes of economic and political activity. This study presents the results from excavations at the Yayamari site (4850 masl) located in the Sibinacocha valley of the Cordillera Vilcanota between the Cusco and Lake Titicaca regions, two major centers of populations and power in the Andes during the 2nd millennium a.d. We complement our analysis of the ephemeral material record of pastoral architecture and artifact assemblages from Yayamari with regional environmental and culture-historical information. We propose that Yayamari juxtaposes centuries-long, far-ranging cultural and economic affiliations with the mundane activities of intermittent pastoral home-making in a high-altitude setting rich in natural resources and supernatural meaning.

J	Winder, M; Buergi, HR; Spaak, P				Winder, M; Buergi, HR; Spaak, P			Seasonal vertical distribution of phytoplankton and copepod species in a high-mountain lake	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Many zooplankton species migrate to deeper water layers during the day to reduce light-dependent mortality risk at the surface layers. Theories explaining diel vertical migration (DVM) of zooplankters share the assumption that the surface waters are more food-rich compared to the deep-water layers and that zooplankters; return at night to the surface to profit from the warmer, food-rich environment. However, evidence suggests that the resources in deep-water layers can be as profitable as in the upper water layers for zooplankton. Those deep-water food maxima have often been overlooked in freshwater. In this study we investigated the vertical distribution of phytoplankton together with the vertical day and night distribution of copepod species in a high-mountain lake with a deep-water phytoplankton maximum dominated by cryptophytes and blue-greens. All copepod species, including the small-sized individuals avoided the upper strata during daytime. Adult Cyclops abyssorum migrated almost throughout the entire year. In contrast, the Eudiaptomus gracilis and copepodites of C. abyssorum and nauplia of both species did not migrate but remained in the same water layers day and night. Secchi depth transparency significantly correlated with daytime depth of adult copepods. Daytime depths are usually associated with high concentration of algal biovolume and moderate temperature. Although food conditions are better in deeper strata, for some species the warmer temperatures in the surface waters may be the reason why they migrate to shallower depths during the night.

Macrophytes support denitrification by supplying organic carbon. Organic carbon available to denitrifying bacteria is released from plant litter and from living macrophytes. Macrophytes offer attachment surfaces for epiphytes, also producing organic matter, and for denitrifying bacteria. Emergent macrophytes are generally more productive than submerged macrophytes, but submerged macrophytes have more epiphytes and offer a larger attachment area in the water column for denitrifying bacteria. Emergent and submerged vegetation differ in their seasonal patterns of release of organic carbon. We conclude that a mixture of emergent and submerged macrophytes may be beneficial for nitrogen removal in wetlands with a surface-flow of nitrate-rich water. The influence of vegetation on wetland hydraulics must also be considered. A wetland design with deeper parts favoring submerged macrophytes alternating, along the water few, with shallower parts covered by emergent macrophytes, may promote denitrification processes and distribution of water flow.					; Weisner, Stefan/AAP-1457-2020	Weisner, Stefan/0000-0002-5181-0391; 													0044-7447					SEP	1994	23	6					363	366																WOS:A1994PN58600008

Growth response of soda lake bacterial communities to simulated rainfall	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Moderately saline soda lakes harbor extremely abundant and fast growing bacterial communities. An interesting phenomenon of an explosive bacterial growth in shallow soda lakes in Eastern Austria after dilution with rainwater, concomitantly with a significant decrease in temperature was observed in a former study. In the present study, we tried to identify the factors being responsible for this enhanced bacterial growth in laboratory batch cultures. Three experiments were performed with water taken from two different lakes at different seasons. Natural soda lake water was diluted with distilled water, artificial lake water, sterile filtered soda lake water, and grazer-free water to test (1) for the influence of compatible solutes released to the environment and reduced salt stress after osmotic down-shock, (2) for the influence of nutrients, which may be washed in from the dry areas of the lake bottom after rainfall and (3) for the decrease of grazing pressure due to dilution. The potential influence of (4) viruses was indirectly deduced. The response of the bacterial community to the manipulations was measured by changes in bacterial numbers, the incorporation of H-3-leucine and the concomitant determination of the amount of H-3-leucine uptaking bacteria by microautoradiography. The influence of the environmental factors enhancing bacterial growth after a simulated rainfall event showed variations between the lakes and over the seasons. The addition of nutrients was, in all experiments, the main factor triggering bacterial growth. The decrease in grazing pressure and viral lysis after dilution was of significant importance in two of three experiments. In the experiment with the highest salinity, we could show that either compatible solutes released after osmotic down-shock and used as a source of nutrients for the soda lake bacterial populations or reduced salt stress were most probably responsible for the observed marked enhancement of bacterial growth.

J	Donovan, LA; Richards, JH				Donovan, LA; Richards, JH			Juvenile shrubs show differences in stress tolerance, but no competition or facilitation, along a stress gradient	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 We investigated experimentally differences in abiotic stress tolerance and the effects of plant-plant interactions for two desert shrubs, Chrysothamnus nauseosus and Sarcobatus vermiculatus, along a soil salinity (NaCl) and boron (B) gradient at Mono Lake, California, USA. Based on differences in natural distribution, and the classical expectation of a trade-off between competitive ability and stress tolerance, we hypothesized that (i) Chrysothamnus would have greater competitive ability than Sarcobatus at the low salinity end of the gradient, and that (ii) Sarcobatus would be more stress tolerant than Chrysothamnus. 2 Juvenile target plants of Chrysothamnus and Sarcobatus were planted into four sites along the gradient. Biomass was determined by destructive harvests over two growing seasons. At each site, interspecific relative competitive ability was assessed as the effect of Sarcobatus neighbours on Chrysothamnus targets compared to the effect of Chrysothamnus neighbours on Sarcobatus targets. Stress tolerance was assessed as the ability of each species to survive and grow, in the absence of neighbours, at different sites along the gradient. 3 The two species did not differ in the relative strength of plant-plant interactions, providing no support for the expectation that Chrysothamnus had greater competitive ability than Sarcobatus. Furthermore, there was no evidence for competition or facilitation, either interspecific or intraspecific, at any site in either year of the study. However, fertilization treatments demonstrated nutrient limitations, soil water reached limiting levels and root systems of targets and neighbours overlapped substantially. It is therefore surprising that plant-plant interactions among juveniles apparently play little role in the growth and survival of shrubs in this saline desert habitat. 4 Sarcobatus was more stress tolerant than Chrysothamnus and the two species performed optimally at different sites along the gradient. Sarcobatus juveniles grew best at the two most saline sites and survived at all sites, whereas Chrysothamnus juveniles grew best at a low-salinity site and did not survive at the most saline site. The difference in site of optimal performance may be due to differences in nutrient limitations or to interactions between nutrient availability and sodium (Na) and B tolerance.

Biological N fixation (BNF), as a main contributor to N loading, plays a critical role in the N cycle. The N-2 fixation rate (N(2)fix) is regulated by many factors and is usually higher under conditions of N deficiency. Most studies have focused on the regulation of factors that influence the N(2)fix in specific aquatic ecosystems or artificial conditions, while fewer have focused on large scale such as the latitudinal distribution of N(2)fix. To understand the regulation of the N(2)fix in latitudinal zones, the key factors, and the underlying mechanism, we compared the N(2)fix in 27 lakes located in different latitudinal zones and analyzed the main regulators. The results showed that (1) heterocyst density (D-Het) and the N(2)fix were highest in low-temperate lakes and were 2.5-2.7 and 11.6-22.1 times greater than in high-temperate lakes and tropical lakes, respectively, in the 99th quantile; (2) D-Het increased and then decreased with increasing latitude and radiation, and peaked at 30.28 degrees N and 2300 J/cm/d; (3) D-Het was positively correlated with temperature and increased slightly with increasing temperature; (4) N(2)fix increased and then decreased with increasing latitude, temperature and radiation, and peaked at 38.8 degrees N, 24.21 degrees C and 2120 J/cm/d. The results suggest that BNF could be regulated by larger scale factors, e.g., temperature and radiation in latitudinal scale. Compared with high-temperate lakes and tropical lakes, low-temperate lakes may face more difficulties in controlling eutrophication due to the potentially higher N loading from BNF under similar nutrient and morphometric conditions.

Thus, identifying the trends in the water quality and the factors which influence the trends along a diverted river is a prerequisite to ensuring the safety of the water diversion. As an important control unit of the Eastern Route of the South to North Water Diversion Project, the hilly eastern region of Nansi Lake Basin (ENLB) suffers excess water pollution in the water transferred into Nansi Lake during the flood season. The comprehensive pollution index (CPI), the Mann-Kendall trend test and analysis of variances were used to characterize the spatiotemporal variation of water quality in the three main mountainous rivers of the ENLB. The contribution of different factors which influencing the variation of the water quality parameters may be explained using ridge regression analysis. The results showed that the CPI for the three major rivers decreased significantly from 2000 to 2012. The rivers had problems in compliance, and this was most noticeable in the Guangfu River. The main pollutants exceeding the water quality standards were the chemical oxygen demand and total phosphorus. The GDP per capita was the largest factor which influenced the changes in the regional water quality, with the average contribution being 30%. An increase in the water storage capacity was shown to have a positive effect on improving the water quality. The results provided a scientific basis for establishing a regional pollution control strategy and would give support to the planning of future water diversion projects.					yang, ray/JOJ-7331-2023; ZHANG, YU/IRZ-5949-2023															2296-665X				JUL 1	2022	10								931642	10.3389/fenvs.2022.931642	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2022.931642													WOS:000827288500001

The lakes were remote from direct anthropogenic influences and ranged in surface area from 89 to 35 000 ha. Fish mercury concentrations were not related to ratios of drainage basin area to lake size, to ratios of epilimnetic area to lake size, to lake alkalinity, or to the concentration of mercury in lake sediments. Rates of mercury methylation (M) were positively dependent on water temperature whereas rates of methyl mercury demethylation (D) were inversely related to temperature. Thus, M/D was strongly temperature dependent. Mercury concentrations in four fish species were significantly positively correlated with mean epilimnetic water temperatures (r2's ranged from 0.66 to 0.88). This suggested that higher water temperatures in smaller lakes during the open-water season influenced M/D ratios and were the cause of higher fish mercury levels. No lake size related variation was observed in the mercury concentrations in benthivorous fishes. Our hypothesis that epilimnetic temperature affects mercury concentrations in fish deserves further attention, given the possible effects of climate warming on mercury contamination of fishery resources.

Length-frequency analyses of populations from the Great Lakes and review of historical benthic studies suggest that the mussel was introduced into Lake St. Clair in late 1986, probably as a result of the discharge of ballast water from an ocean-crossing vessel. Following the 1990 reproductive season, Dreissena populations ranged from the head of the St. Clair River, through Lake St. Clair, the Detroit River, Lake Erie, the Welland Canal, and the Niagara River to the western basin and southern shoreline of Lake Ontario. Isolated populations were found in the St. Lawrence River and in harbours in Lakes Huron, Michigan, and Superior. The rapid dispersal of this organism has resulted from its high fecundity, pelagic larval stage, bysso-pelagic drifting ability of juveniles, and human activities associated with commercial shipping, fishing, and boating (research and pleasure). Virtually any waterbody that can be reached by boaters and fisherman within a few days travel of the lower Great Lakes, particularly Lake Erie, seems to be at risk of being invaded by this nuisance species.																			0706-652X					AUG	1991	48	8					1381	1388		10.1139/f91-165	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f91-165													WOS:A1991GC70700005

The earliest evidence for a supraorbital salt gland in dinosaurs in new Early Cretaceous ornithurines	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Supraorbital fossae occur when salt glands are well developed, a condition most pronounced in marine and desert-dwelling taxa in which salt regulation is key. Here, we report the first specimens from lacustrine environments of the Jehol Biota that preserve a distinct fossa above the orbit, where the salt gland fossa is positioned in living birds. The Early Cretaceous ornithurine bird specimens reported here are about 40 million years older than previously reported Late Cretaceous marine birds and represent the earliest described occurrence of the fossa. We find no evidence of avian salt gland fossae in phylogenetically earlier stem birds or non-avialan dinosaurs, even in those argued to be predominantly marine or desert dwelling. The apparent absence of this feature in more basal dinosaurs may indicate that it is only after miniaturization close to the origin of flight that excretory mechanisms were favored over exclusively renal mechanisms of salt regulation resulting in an increase in gland size leaving a bony trace. The ecology of ornithurine birds is more diverse than in other stem birds and may have included seasonal shifts in foraging range, or, the environments of some of the Jehol lakes may have included more pronounced periods of high salinity.

J	Morgan, DL				Morgan, DL			Distribution and biology of Galaxias truttaceus (Galaxiidae) in south-western Australia, including first evidence of parasitism of fishes in Western Australia by Ligula intestinalis (Cestoda)	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												The freshwater trout minnow, Galaxias truttaceus, is restricted to the small catchments of the Goodga and Kalgan Rivers in Western Australia. Its large geographic separation from populations in south-eastern Australia, and subsequent reproductive isolation and variation in the prevailing environmental conditions, has created marked differences in biology (and morphology) between the eastern and western populations of G. truttaceus. The biology (spawning period, longevity, growth rates, diet and parasitism) of G. truttaceus in the Goodga River is described and then compared with information on the biology of diadromous and landlocked populations in south-eastern Australia (i.e. Tasmania) (see Humphries 1989). In the Goodga River, ca. 34 and 8% of males and females, respectively, attain maturity at the end of their first year, while only four mature males and one mature female 0+ fish were found in the Tasmanian populations. Adults migrate upstream prior to spawning which peaks during April and May. Larvae, which hatch at ca. 6.5 mm (cf. 7.5-9.0 mm in Tasmania), move downstream into Moates Lake for a few months before re-entering the river. Of the 810 G. truttaceus collected, ca. 53, 34, 10, 2, 1, 0.2 and 0.1% belonged to the 0+, 1+, 2+, 3+, 4+, 5+ and 7+ age classes, respectively. In contrast, the Tasmanian populations have a much higher proportion of older fish. At the end of their first, second and third years, the males on average attain 60, 84 and 95 mm total length (TL), respectively, whereas females attain 63, 89 and 103 mm TL, respectively at those ages. Only one fish > 140 mm TL was captured, which contrasts with the Tasmanian fish, where a substantial proportion are > 140 mm TL. The diet of fish > 40 mm TL consisted of between 65 and 96% terrestrial fauna (mainly coleopterans and hymenopterans) in the different seasons. Larval fish diets were largely comprised of copepods. The occurrence of the introduced cestode Ligula intestinalis in ca. 7% of G. truttaceus represents the first record of this parasite inWestern Australia. It was found to cause gonadal retardation and gross morphological deformities, the latter of which possibly increases the risk of avian predation.					; Morgan, David/H-9794-2019	Morgan, David/0000-0003-1948-1484; 													0378-1909					FEB	2003	66	2					155	167		10.1023/A:1023645506913	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1023645506913													WOS:000182583800005
J	Welker, JM; Brown, KB; Fahnestock, JT				Welker, JM; Brown, KB; Fahnestock, JT			CO2 flux in Arctic and alpine dry tundra: Comparative field responses under ambient and experimentally warmed conditions	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												We compared growing season CO2 flux patterns between botanically similar arctic and alpine dry tundra ecosystems in Alaska and Colorado under ambient and experimentally warmed conditions. Measurements were taken during the 1997 growing season, 3 yr after the warming treatments were begun. Under ambient weather conditions, arctic dry tundra at Toolik Lake, Alaska was a net source (4 g CO2-C m(-2)) of CO2 to the atmosphere, while alpine dry tundra at Niwot Ridge, Colorado, was a net CO2 sink (7 g CO2-C m(-2)) during the growing season. Experimental warming of arctic tundra by 1 to 3 degrees C, resulted in a sevenfold (32 g CO2-C m(-2)) increase in this ecosystem's carbon source activity. Similar warming in alpine tundra changed this ecosystem from a net carbon sink to a net carbon source of 8 g CO2-C m(-2) over the growing season. In the Arctic, increased CO2 efflux with warming was largely the result of increased rates of ecosystem respiration throughout the entire growing season, while in the alpine ecosystem respiration increased only early in the growing season. Rates of photosynthesis were generally not affected by experimental warming at either site. These data suggest that global warming will accentuate the carbon source activity of dry tundra in the northern foothills of Alaska and will change the net CO2 exchange of alpine dry tundra in the northern Rocky Mountains from a net CO2 sink to a source.

J	Yabunaka, K; Hosomi, M; Murakami, A				Yabunaka, K; Hosomi, M; Murakami, A			Novel application of a back-propagation artificial neural network model formulated to predict algal bloom	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY					4th IAWQ International Symposium on Systems Analysis and Computing in Water Quality Management (WATERMATEX 97)	JUN 17-20, 1997	QUEBEC CITY, CANADA	Intl Assoc Water Qual, Univ Laval				This paper describes the novel application of an artificial neural network (ANN) model based on the backpropagation method formulated to predict algal bloom by simulating the future growth of five phytoplankton species and the chlorophyll a concentration in the second largest lake in Japan: eutrophic freshwater Lake Kasumigaura. Comparison of observed and calculated values showed that (i) seasonal variations in the biomass of Microcystis spp, were well-predicted with respect to the timing and magnitude of algal bloom, and (ii) the concentration of chlorophyll a, as an indicator of the total biomass of phytoplankton, was well predicted in general. The resultant correlations for the other species, however, showed that model learning was insufficient to effectively predict species biomass; thereby indicating that some unknown factors which are not represented by the set of water quality parameters used as model input data affect phytoplankton growth. A sensitivity analysis performed on input parameters showed that chlorophyll a concentration was mainly affected by PO4-P concentration, while cyanobacteria and diatom species were affected by NO3-N and NH4-N concentrations, respectively. These results indicate that the ''algal bloom'' ANN model achieved reasonable effectiveness with respect to learning the relationship between the selected water quality parameters and algal bloom.

J	Li, XW; Shen, YM				Li, Xinwen; Shen, Yongming			Numerical simulation of the impacts of water level variation on water age in Dahuofang Reservoir	FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE												The transport timescales were investigated in response to water level variation under different constant flow rates in Dahuofang Reservoir. The concept of water age was applied to quantify the transport timescales. A three-dimensional hydrodynamic model was developed based on the Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC). The model was calibrated for water surface elevation and temperature profiles from April 1, 2008 to October 31, 2008. Comparisons of observed and modeled data showed that the model reproduced the water level fluctuation and thermal stratification during warm season and vertical mixing during cold season fairly well. The calibrated model was then applied to investigate the response of water age to water level changes in Dahuofang Reservoir. Model results showed that water age increases from confluence toward dam zone. In the vertical direction, the water age is relatively uniform at upstream and stratifies further downstream, with a larger value at bottom layer than at surface layer. Comparisons demonstrated that water level variation has a significant impact on transport timescales in the reservoir. The impact of water level drawdown on water age is stronger at bottom layer than at surface layer. Under high flow conditions, the water age decreases 0-20 days at surface layer and 15-25 days at bottom layer. Under mean flow conditions, the water age decreases 20-30 days at surface layer and 30-50 days at bottom layer. Furthermore, the impact is minor in the upstream and increases further downstream. The vertical stratification of water age weakens as the water level decreases. This study provides a numerical tool to quantify the transport timescale in Dahuofang Reservoir and supports adaptive management of regional water resources by local authorities.																			2095-0195	2095-0209				JUN	2015	9	2					209	224		10.1007/s11707-014-0460-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11707-014-0460-9													WOS:000353833800005

Species Identity and Nest Location Predict Agonistic Interactions at a Breeding Colony of Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) and Great Blue Herons (Ardea herodias)	WATERBIRDS												Recent dramatic growth of the North American Interior population of Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) has led to concern about potential impacts of this species on co-nesting colonial waterbirds. Previous investigations of these concerns have focused on Double-crested Cormorant interactions with other species within homogeneous breeding environments, making broad patterns difficult to identify. The present study examined how nest location, nest density, and species identity mediate agonistic interactions among Double-crested Cormorants and Great Blue Herons (Ardea herodias) nesting at a colony site in central Minnesota, USA. Twenty-six Double-crested Cormorant nests and 27 Great Blue Heron nests were observed for 30 min weekly for 8 weeks during the breeding season to estimate frequency of agonistic behavior and identify species-level patterns of interaction. Most agonistic interactions observed (81%) were intraspecific interactions among Double-crested Cormorants; Great Blue Herons engaged in a higher combined total count of interspecific and intraspecific interactions when they nested near Double-crested Cormorants. Interspecific interactions were more common among ground-nesting birds than among tree-nesting birds. This study suggests that further investigation into impacts of Double-crested Cormorants on co-nesting birds is most warranted for ground-nesting colonies.

J	Kuczynska-Kippen, N				Kuczynska-Kippen, Natalia			The Impact of the Macrophyte Substratum and Season on Crustacean Zooplankton Communities of Three Shallow and Macrophyte-Dominated Lakes	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												I conducted a three-season study on three lakes in three different habitats (Chara tomentosa bed, Typha angustifolia stand, and the open water) in order to determine the best predictors of microcrustacean distribution. The seasonal composition and abundance of crustacean zooplankters were typical of the pelagic zone in temperate lakes, and there was no appreciable difference in the zooplankton communities among the lakes. The lowest species richness and total abundance were in the open water zone, while the highest richness and abundance were within the C. tomentosa stand. Moreover, two cladoceran species (Acroperus harpae and Chydorus sphaericus) were uniquely associated with C. tomentosa. Canonical correspondence analysis identified density of plant stems and oxygen and total organic carbon concentrations in the water as the most important factors structuring the distribution of the microcrustacean community. Stepwise multiple forward regression confirmed that plant stem length and biomass were biometric parameters that influenced crustacean density. Total nitrogen concentration and pH were implicated in the density of Ceriodaphnia pulchella, while temperature and conductivity influenced A. harpae abundance.

J	Chlost, I; Cieslinski, R				Chlost, Izabela; Cieslinski, Roman			Effects of environmental and anthropogenic determinants on changes in groundwater levels in selected peat bogs of Slowinski National Park, northern Poland	GEOLOGOS												The present study focuses on two Baltic-type peat bogs in Slowinski National Park, namely that at Zarnowskie and at Kluki, located in the Lake Lebsko catchment and both characterised by a centrally located dome with a very marshy fringe area featuring an emerging marshy coniferous forest (Vaccinio uliginosi-Pinetum). The Zarnowskie bog is under active protection. A total of 24 flow barriers were installed in drainage ditches during the years 2006 and 2007. The purpose of these barriers was to put a halt to water outflow. In addition, 30 hectares of young pine forest were cleared in order to decrease loss of water via evapotranspiration. Kluki peat bog is only partially protected by Polish law. The lack of efforts to prevent outflow via the canal is due to the fact that the canal is utilised to drain meadows in the vicinity of the village of Lokciowe outside of the national park. Peat formation no longer occurs in this peat bog. The hydrological condition of the bog is catastrophic as a result of its main canal, referred to as Canal C9, which is 2.5 to 3.0 m deep and 10 m wide in places. Both peat bogs are monitored for fluctuations in groundwater. Research has shown that changes in water levels fluctuate based on season of the year and geographical location, which is illustrated quite well using the two studied peat bogs. The water retention rate of the Zarnowskie peat bog may be considered fairly high and is likely to improve due to protective measures enabled by Polish environmental laws. The water retention rate of the bog is consistently improving thanks to these measures, fluctuations in water level are small and the water level does not drop under 0.5 m below ground level even under extreme hydrometeorological conditions. This yields optimum conditions for renewed peat formation in this area. One potential threat is the Krakulice peat extraction facility, which is located in the southern part of the bog close to the boundary with the national park.					; Cieslinski, Roman/A-5427-2008	Cieslinski, Roman/0000-0002-5313-1923; CHLOST, Izabela/0000-0002-4425-178X; 													1426-8981	2080-6574				MAR	2018	24	1					13	27		10.2478/logos-2018-0002	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/logos-2018-0002													WOS:000432491300002

In this paleolimlogical study, seventeen (14+3) new diatom records for freshwater algal flora of Turkey were determined on sediment core samples at five different locations collected in July 2006 from Lakes Ladik (Samsun) and Hazar (Elazig). We recorded seventeen diatom taxa belonging to Naviculales (8), Cymbellales (2), Eunotiales (2), Bacillariales (2), Fragilariales (1), Tabellariales (1) and Aulacoseirales (1) orders from Lakes Ladik (Samsun) and Hazar (Elazig). All of the reported taxa are new records for freshwater algal flora of Turkey. General information on the morphology and taxonomy of the species are briefly described in this paper, with their illustrations.

J	Lindström, S				Lindstrom, Sofie			A review of the enigmatic microalga Tetranguladinium Yu etal. 1983 ex Chen etal. 1988; palaeoecology, stratigraphy and palaeogeographical distribution	PALYNOLOGY												The probable zygnematacean zygospore Tetranguladinium is recorded in Mesozoic strata from southern Scandinavia for the first time. Tetranguladinium, which exhibits morphological similarities to the extant filamentous green alga Mougeotia, occurs in Jurassic-Cretaceous (J/K) boundary (latest Tithonian-Early Berriasian) assemblages from the Vomb Trough, southern Sweden and on the Danish island of Bornholm. The J/K boundary strata of southern Scandinavia were deposited in marginal marine settings, varying from freshwater marshes, lakes and flood plains, to lagoons, shoreface, and shallow marine to fully marine environments. The assemblages containing Tetranguladinium are diverse, consisting of spores and pollen, the colonial green alga Botryococcus, various other zygnematacean zygospores e.g. Ovoidites, Schizosporis and Tetraporina, and rare marine dinoflagellate cysts. A review of published fossil occurrences of Tetranguladinium reveals that its stratigraphical range extends at least from the Late Guadalupian (Mid Permian) to the Holocene. It has been recorded from Africa (Tanzania), Asia (China, Korea), Australia, northwest Europe (Denmark, Great Britain, Sweden), North America (Canada, USA), and South America (Argentina). Depositional and palaeoclimatological data for the known localities of Tetranguladinium confirm a preference for freshwater settings in a humid warm temperate to subtropical-tropical climate, often with a pronounced dry season. The palaeogeographical positions of all the known Tetranguladinium localities indicate that it is has stayed restricted within narrow belts between 30-40 south and 30-60 north of the palaeoequator since the Late Jurassic.

Biogeochemical Modelling of a Seasonally Anoxic Lake: Calibration of Successive and Competitive Pathways and Processes in Lake Aydat, France	AQUATIC GEOCHEMISTRY												A reactive transport model was developed to describe seasonal variations of biogeochemical and physical processes in Lake Aydat. The model includes physical processes such as vertical mixing, sedimentation and advection related to inflows into the lake and biogeochemical conversion processes in the water column and in the sediment surface layer. The reactions described in the model include primary redox reactions such as primary production, aerobic and anaerobic respiration, methanogenesis and secondary reactions established between oxidants and reducers produced by the primary reactions. After adjusting various kinetic constants, the model reasonably reproduced the main features of seasonal variations of dissolved oxygen and nitrate depth profiles and pH. The reactive transport model was also used to quantify the relative importance of different biogeochemical pathways. For instance, ferrous denitrification seems to play an important role when stratification is increasing.

Diversity of bacterial community in different habitats of the same river, as well as seasonal variation, was also examined. Methods and Results Oligonucleotide probes specific for the domain Bacteria and five bacterial groups (high GC content, low GC content, Alpha-, Beta- and Gammaproteobacteria) were used. The Gram-positive populations were dominated by Firmicutes (low GC content), while Gammaproteobacteria showed increased abundances compared to Betaproteobacteria, although an enrichment step for samples was used, something which might had favoured the gamma subclass. Seasonal and along river variations were observed for Gram-negative bacteria but not for Firmicutes. Conclusions We conclude that the changes in bacterial community composition was correlated with environmental conditions and resulted from interactions brought about by physical and biological factors. To our knowledge, this is the first study describing structure and diversity of a bacterial community in a Greek freshwater system, with the use of FISH.

This study examined the seasonal variation in plasma concentrations of T-4 in juvenile American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) from three populations in central Florida, USA. One site, Lake Woodruff National Wildlife Refuge, is considered a reference site whereas the other two lakes, Lake Apopka and Orange Lake, are significantly impacted by human activity. Juvenile American alligators ranging from 75-150 cm in total length were hand-captured at night from November 2000-April 2002. Plasma thyroxine concentrations were analyzed using a radioimmunoassay (RIA) previously validated for alligator plasma. Juvenile American alligators display seasonal variation in circulating T-4 concentrations. Plasma T-4 concentrations decrease from August/September to November and then begin a slow rise until April, at which point they plateau. Sex of juveniles influenced plasma concentrations of T-4 in some months but did not appear to alter the pattern in seasonal variation. The pattern we observed in plasma T-4 concentrations is not directly related to an environmental factor such as ambient temperature but is similar to that seen in plasma sex steroid concentrations during the reproductive cycle of adult alligators. Although the pattern and plasma concentration of T-4 exhibits significant variation among the three lakes studied, the pattern in seasonal variation appears similar. Comparing the seasonal pattern in plasma T-4 with plasma concentrations of sex steroids (testosterone and estradiol-17 beta) or corticosterone could provide important information on the peripubescent life stage of the American alligator.

Abiotic factors that affect the distribution of aquatic macrophytes in shallow north temperate Minnesota lakes: a spatial modeling approach	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												Macrophytes are an integral component of lake communities; therefore, understanding the factors that affect macrophyte community structure is important for conservation and management of lakes. In Sibley County, Minnesota, USA, five of the largest and most recreationally important lakes were surveyed using the point-intercept method. At each point the presence of macrophytes were recorded, water depth was measured, and a sediment sample was collected. Sediment samples were partitioned by determining sand, silt, clay, and organic matter fractions. The richness of macrophytes in all lakes were modeled via generalized linear regression with six explanatory variables: water depth, distance from shore, percent sand, percent silt, percent clay, and percent sediment organic matter. If model residuals were spatially autocorrelated, then a geographically weighted regression was used. Mean species richness (N point(-1)) was negatively related to depth and distance from shore and either positively or negatively related to silt depending on the lake and which macrophytes were present. All species richness models had pseudo-R-2 values between 0.25 and 0.40. Curlyleaf pondweed (Potamogeton crispus) was found at 44% of all sampling points in one lake, and its presence was related to water depth, percent silt, and percent sediment organic matter during early season surveys. Results from this study exhibit the inhibitory relationship between water depth and macrophyte growth. The results from these models suggest interactions are complex between macrophytes, environmental factors, and sediment texture; and that these interactions are species and site specific. A single landscape scale model would not be appropriate to capture the in-lake processes driving macrophyte distribution and abundance; and management strategies will need to be developed on a lake-by-lake basis.

J	Nielsen, DL; Hillman, TJ; Smith, FJ; Shiel, RJ				Nielsen, DL; Hillman, TJ; Smith, FJ; Shiel, RJ			The influence of seasonality and duration of flooding on zooplankton in experimental billabongs	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												The regulation of Australian lowland rivers such as the River Murray has resulted in changes to the flooding characteristics of many associated wetlands. It has been suggested that these changes in flooding have changed the pattern of response of many wetland biota. The substantial variability in the size and shape of these wetlands makes limited field observations difficult to interpret. To overcome this variability 16 experimental billabongs were constructed in which factors that tray cause changes to populations within billabongs could be manipulated. In this paper we report on experiments that test the hypothesis that changing the pattern of flooding alters the density and diversity of rotifers and microcrustaceans in billabongs. The experimental billabongs were sampled fortnightly for two years. During this time four flood events were imposed. Flooding of the experimental billabongs resulted in increased microcrustacean abundance. Rotifer abundance rarely increased following flooding. Changing the time of flooding did not modify this response. Observed changes in community structure following flooding result from changes in the relative densities of taxa already present rather than changes in the community composition.

J	LEISTER, DL; BAKER, JE				LEISTER, DL; BAKER, JE			ATMOSPHERIC DEPOSITION OF ORGANIC CONTAMINANTS TO THE CHESAPEAKE BAY	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												To estimate loadings of contaminants from the atmosphere to the Chesapeake Bay, ambient atmospheric concentrations and wet deposition fluxes of several polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were measured at a shore-based station between June 1990 and December 1991. Geometric mean concentrations of individual PAHs in air ranged from 0.003 (dibenz[ah]anthracene) to 1.4 ng m-3 (phenanthrene) and the observed temporal variability in PAH levels in the air ranged from 0.1 to 41% about the respective geometric mean concentrations. The mean ambient atmospheric PCB concentration over the Chesapeake Bay during the study period was 0.21 ng m-3, with a relative standard deviation of 56%. PCB concentrations in the air were slightly correlated with air temperature. Volume-weighted mean (VWM) concentrations of individual PAHs in precipitation ranged from 1.1 (dibenz[ah]anthracene) to 17 ng l-1 (pyrene). The VWM t-PCB concentration was 1.6 ng l-1. The temporal variability of HOC concentrations in rainfall was as large as one order of magnitude, with no apparent seasonal trend, suggesting highly variable HOC scavenging processes. Assuming a dry deposition velocity of 0.49 +/- 0.23 cm s-1 dry particle fluxes of PAHs ranged from 1 +/- 0.4 (anthracene) to 16 +/- 7 (fluoranthene) mug m-2 yr-1. The dry deposition velocity was derived using monthly average wind speeds and temperature differentials derived for the Chesapeake Bay area from climatological compilations (Quinn T. L., Ondov J. M. and Holland J. Z. (1992) Dependence of deposition velocity on the frequency of meteorological observations for the Chesapeake Bay. J. Aerosol Sci. 23, S973-S976; Wu Z. Y., Ondov J. M., Holland J. Z. and Lin Z. C. (1992) Dry deposition fluxes of elements in Chesapeake Bay aerosol. J. Aerosol Sci. 23, S969-S972]. Wet fluxes of PAHS ranged from 1 (anthracene) to 20 (pyrene) mug m-2 yr-1. Total (wet + dry) fluxes ranged from 2 +/- 0.4(anthracene)to 35 +/- 7 (pyrene) mug m-2 y-1. The t-PCB wet flux was 1.9 mug m-2 yr-1, with the estimated dry particle flux accounting for 75% of the total flux (3.3 +/- 0.6 mug m-2 yr-1). The t-PCB wet flux in Chesapeake Bay is similar to that of rural Minnesota [2 mug M-2 yr-1, Franz T.P., Eisenreich S.J. and Swanson M. B. (1991) Evaluation of precipitation samplers for assessing atmospheric fluxes Of trace organic contaminants. Chemo 23, 343-361]. Annual atmospheric loadings of individual PAHs to the surface waters of the Chesapeake Bay were calculated by extrapolating the total flux to the surface area of the Chesapeake Bay. Individual PAH loadings range from 23 +/- 5 (anthracene) to 403 +/- 81 (pyrene) kg yr-1 and the t-PCB annual atmospheric loading is 38 +/- 7 kg yr-1.

On the finest grid (5-km resolution) centered over Lake Ontario, MM5 produced a snowband in the correct location having a size and orientation similar to the band observed by the WSR-88D radar at Binghamton, New York. The simulated precipitation distribution agreed well with the observed snowfall during the first 18 h during the time when the snowband was in its midlake position extending into the Tug Hill plateau. During the last 12 h of the simulation, when both the observed and simulated snowbands lay along the south shore of Lake Ontario, the simulated snowfall at inland locations of Oswego County was less than observed. During this period, the simulated precipitation over Lake Ontario appeared to be excessive, although no radar data or ground truth was available to confirm this. Two short-wave troughs interacted with the Lake Ontario snowband. The temporary weakening of the snowband after passage of the first trough was simulated well in the triply nested MM5 simulation. A comparison was made between the operational Eta Model run and an MM5 simulation on a grid of comparable resolution (80 km) in handling the passage of the second more vigorous short wave. Both the Eta and the 80-km MM5 were a few hours too early with the passage of this trough. The nested-grid version of MM5 was correct in simulating the rapid southward movement of the band to Oswego County just after the second trough moved east of the lake. However, because of the timing error with the trough, MM5 was premature by a few hours in the southward shift of the snowband. Results on the 15-km grid indicated that moisture plumes from Lake Huron and Georgian Bay fed into the Lake Ontario band. In the lowest few hundred meters, these plumes were deflected around the Shelburne Plateau, which lies between Lake Huron and Lake Ontario. Future research will focus on interactions between circulations downwind of Lake Huron and snowbands that form over Lake Ontario. The results of the 4-5 January 1995 simulation are sufficiently encouraging to suggest that MMS may be used to make real-time forecasts of lake-effect snowstorms. The lead author is participating in a COMET cooperative project to provide lake-effect snow forecasts, in GEMPAK format, to the National Weather Service Forecast Offices at Buffalo and Binghamton using a 20-km nested grid over Lakes Huron, Erie, and Ontario. Despite relatively coarse resolution, MM5 has produced useful predictions of snowband location and movement during the 1996/97 and 1997/98 lake-effect snow seasons.																			0882-8156					DEC	1998	13	4					893	920		10.1175/1520-0434(1998)013<0893:MMSOTJ>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0434(1998)013<0893:MMSOTJ>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000077663200001
J	Lowe, RL; Pillsbury, RW				Lowe, RL; Pillsbury, RW			Shifts in benthic algal community structure and function following the appearance of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas), proliferation in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron is associated with increased water clarity and increased light levels on benthic substrata in the littoral zone. We hypothesized that the filtering activities of Dreissena and associated increases in light penetration should affect the structure and function of benthic algae in the bay. Monthly quantitative benthic algal samples were collected from natural substrata by SCUBA in the littoral zone of the bay through the growing seasons of 1991 (initial Dreissena colonization), 1992 and 1993 (post-Dreissena colonization). Algal community structure was examined microscopically and productivity rates were measured using carbon-14 in sealed acrylic chambers in situ. Our data demonstrate that, following Dreissena proliferation, light penetration, benthic algal biomass, chlorophyll concentrations and rates of benthic primary productivity have increased. These changes coincided with a shift from diatom domination of the benthic algal community to a flora dominated by filamentous green algae (Zygnematales). We suggest that these shifts have the potential to affect benthic food webs within littoral zones of the Great Lakes.																			0380-1330						1995	21	4					558	566		10.1016/S0380-1330(95)71066-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(95)71066-8													WOS:A1995TP51700013
J	Boyd, M; Running, GL; Havholm, K				Boyd, M; Running, GL; Havholm, K			Paleoecology and geochronology of glacial lake hind during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition: A context for Folsom surface finds on the Canadian prairies	GEOARCHAEOLOGY-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL												Stratigraphic and paleoecologic (palynomorph, macrobotanical) data obtained from a cutbank of the Souris River in southwestern Manitoba establish some fundamental parameters of Folsom land-use in association with a proglacial lake on the Canadian Prairies. By dating the regression of glacial Lake Hind, we observed that recorded Folsom sites are restricted to areas of the Hind basin drained shortly before 10,400 yr B.P. This pattern may therefore record the interception of seasonal resources on recently-drained proglacial lake surfaces. Based on paleovegetation reconstructions, we note that these surfaces were rapidly colonized by emergent and aquatic vegetation following regression, generating a viable resource base for Folsom hunter-gatherers. However, low plant productivity and diversity may have greatly limited the extent to which this locale was exploited, in contrast to nonperiglacial regions on the Plains. We also suggest that wetland plant succession during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition was due, at least locally, to climate-forced fluctuations in groundwater levels.

J	Takano, K; Igarashi, S; Mikami, H; Hino, S				Takano, K; Igarashi, S; Mikami, H; Hino, S			Causation of reversal simultaneity for diatom biomass and density of Phormidium tenue during the warm season in eutrophic Lake Barato, Japan	LIMNOLOGY												The diatom biomass of Lake Barato, as measured from July to September, decreased simultaneously with an increase in filament density of Phormidium tenue after 1997. There was a high negative correlation between the diatom biomass and the densities of P. tenue (r2 = 0.928). Although total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations decreased from 1996, TN:TP ratio increased from 1997 because the TP concentration became markedly lower. The decrease in diatom biomass might have been due to the loss in phosphorus available for algae. Because the increase in density of P. tenue might have been due to the decrease in diatom biomass, experiments using a growth inhibitor for diatoms were performed to examine whether the density of cyanobacteria increases without diatom growth. Samples of the lake water collected in three seasons (August and October 1998, May 1999) were incubated with and without germanium (Ge) as a growth inhibitor of diatoms. The increase in density of P. tenue was inhibited concurrent with the increase in diatom biomass in the first and middle stages of incubation without the addition of Ge in August 1998 and May 1999. In contrast, a higher density of P. tenue was observed in the incubation with diatom growth inhibited by Ge over the same period. These results suggest that diatoms have an effect in restraining the growth of P. tenue.																			1439-8621	1439-863X				AUG	2003	4	2					73	78		10.1007/s10201-003-0094-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-003-0094-1													WOS:000185183700002

A machine-learning approach to predict success of a biocontrol for invasive Eurasian watermilfoil reduction	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Myriophyllum spicatum, more commonly known as Eurasian watermilfoil (EWM), is one of the most invasive aquatic plants in North America, causing negative ecological and economic impacts in ecosystems where it proliferates. Many control strategies have been developed and implemented to mitigate EWM growth and spread, although the results are mixed and there is no consensus on lake-specific strategies. Here, we describe the development of a predictive model using a support vector technique, that predicts the success of biological pest control using Euhrychiopsis lecontei (the milfoil weevil), a milfoil specialist, to reduce EWM in lakes. Such a model is informed by lake characteristics (limnological and landscape) and augmentation strategies. To develop our predictive model, we performed a metadata analysis from 133 published peer-reviewed literature and professional reports of milfoil weevil augmentation field experiments that contained information on lake characteristics. The predictive model's algorithm uses a support vector machine (SMV) to learn patterns among lake characteristics, along with the recorded augmentation strategy and the reported success of each study, where success is a measure of EWM change over a season and is recorded in a variety of ways (e.g., EWM biomass change, EWM percent change, EWM visual change, etc.,). Overall, the model results suggests that shallower lakes, more frequent weevil augmentations, and larger weevil overwintering habitat are the most important predictors for EWM reduction success by weevil augmentation. Although watermilfoil weevil augmentation is a promising mitigation strategy, it may not work for all lakes. However, in terms of suggesting weevil augmentation, our model is a valuable tool for lake stakeholders and resource managers, who can use it to determine whether milfoil weevil augmentation, which can be very costly due to the difficulties in finding and raising milfoil weevils, will be a useful and sustainable approach to control EWM in their lake community.																			1051-0761	1939-5582				SEP	2022	32	6							e2625	10.1002/eap.2625	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eap.2625		JUN 2022						35397182					WOS:000805018800001

Novel Combined Approach of GIS and Electrical Tomography to Identify Marsh/Lake at Kastrouli Late Mycenaean Settlement (Desfina, Greece)	QUATERNARY												The Kastrouli Late Bronze settlement in Phocis province, central Greece, has been proved to have been an important center in the periphery of the Mycenaean palaces. It was reused at least partially and was cultivated until the 20th century. The presence of a flat area off the Kastrouli hill and the seasonal flooding nowadays led to the present investigation, questioning the formation of an ancient lake or marsh/swamp. A methodological approach was applied combining the digital elevation model (DEM) and GIS of the wider and confined area, examining slopes between 0 and 5 degrees (0 and 8.75%), with electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) traverses of around 300 and 500 m, reaching a depth of 100 m. The ERT data were rapidly collected on profiles and provided a cross-sectional (2D) plot. It was found that, in the area, there is a basin with a length of 100 m and a depth of around 40-50 m. The sedimentation process over the millennia has filled the basin, with the upper 5-6 m surface layers of the area having a low resistivity. The presence of two natural sinkholes with apparent engineered hydraulic works is noted to conform to drainage and produce a habitable environment, protecting the cultivated land and avoiding a swamp associated with health issues.					; Tsokas, Grigorios/AAQ-9043-2020; Evelpidou, Niki/AAE-7862-2020; LIRITZIS, IOANNIS/A-9444-2013	Tzouxanioti, Maria/0000-0002-2871-5847; Tsokas, Grigorios/0000-0002-4803-4985; Evelpidou, Niki/0000-0001-7817-4471; Louvaris, Prodromos/0000-0001-9200-6810; FIKOS, ILIAS/0000-0002-8321-9117													2571-550X					JUN	2022	5	2							26	10.3390/quat5020026	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/quat5020026													WOS:000815944600001
J	Qiao, G; Li, HW				Qiao, Gang; Li, Hongwei			Lake Water Footprint Determination Using Linear Clustering-Based Algorithm and Lake Water Changes in the Tibetan Plateau from 2002 to 2020	PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING												Satellite altimetry is an effective technique for monitoring water level changes in inland lakes in remote areas, such as the Tibetan Plateau. Lake water footprint (LWF) determination from tracks of satellite altimetry data is a preliminary step for generating lake water level sequences. However, the traditional method of LWF determination using accurate lake boundaries extracted from remote sensing images is laborious, and the images do not always exist. Another method dedicated to a single satellite altimeter sensor; i.e., physical parameter-based algorithm has been designed, but this method sometimes fails when data are influenced by surroundings such as wetlands or glaciers. To overcome these problems, we present a novel linear clustering-based approach for LWF determination to generate a time series of lake water levels by using multi-mission satellite altimetry data sets over typical lakes of the Tibetan Plateau. Our method projects all footprints onto two matrices. This approach is then illustrated using Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite, Environmental Satellite, and CtyoSat-2 altimetry data sets for four typical lakes in the Tibetan Plateau. Among all the methods, our method performs best in terms of accuracy. Finally, the time series lake water levels of 179 lakes in the Tibetan Plateau were extracted using our method. The results indicate that from 2002 to 2020, the average water level of most lakes increased by 0.167 +/- 0.155 m/a, whereas a decreasing trend of 0.066 +/- 0.047 m/a was observed in the Yarlung Zangbo river basin. The different precipitation conditions in the inner basin and the Yarlung Zangbo river basin are suggested to be the major reasons for the opposite trends. The proposed method performs well for Tibetan lakes with planar water stages and small seasonal fluctuations but is not applicable for lakes with other conditions, which requires further study.

A normal distribution of the majority of parameters and a different degree of their interrelation and dependence on some environmental factors (salinity, ion composition, and ratio) were recorded. The analysis included seasonal, interannual, and sexual variability of Artemia. The greatest influence of salinity and separately of main ions (except for carbonates, hydrocarbonates, and calcium) on the abdomen and furca structure is shown. No correlation was found between water salinity and body length. The cluster analysis of a complex of morphological parameters showed grouping of populations by salinity of lakes instead of their geographical position and sexual structure of populations.

J	Liu, XQ; Wang, HZ				Liu, Xue-Qin; Wang, Hong-Zhu			Food web of benthic macro invertebrates in a large Yangtze River-connected lake: the role of flood disturbance	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												This Study was conducted in Lake Dongtinghu, a large river-connected lake on the Yangtze River flood-plain, China. Our goal was to determine trophic relationships among benthic macroinvertebrates, as well as the effects of flood disturbance on the benthic food web of a river-connected lake. Macroinvertebrates in the lake fed mainly on detritus and plankton (both zooplankton and phytoplankton). Food web Structure in Lake Dongtinghu was characterized by molluscs as the dominant group, low connectance, high level of omnivory. based oil detritus and primary production, and most ingestion concentrating on a few links. Our analyses showed that flood disturbance is an important factor affecting the benthic food web in Lake Dongtinghu. The numbers of species and functional feeding groups (FFGs), and the density and biomass of macroinvertebrates decreased significantly during flooding. Connectance was higher during the flood season than in other seasons, indicating that floods have a strong effect on connectance in this Yangtze River-connected lake. Flood effects on the benthic web were also evident in the decrease of niche overlaps within and anion, FFGs. Our results provide useful information regarding biodiversity conservation on the Yangtze floodplain. Reconstructing and maintaining natural and regular flow regimes between Yangtze lakes and the river is essential for restoration of macroinvertebrates on the floodplain.

Concentration-exposure time relationships for controlling sago pondweed (Stuckenia pectinata) with endothall	WEED TECHNOLOGY												The submersed macrophyte, sago pondweed, frequently grows to nuisance levels in water conveyance systems throughout the western United States and can cause problems in lakes, reservoirs, and other water bodies. The liquid dipotassium and dimethylalkylamine salt formulations of endothall were evaluated for controlling sago pondweed using short exposure times (3 to 24 h) under controlled environmental conditions (14: 10 h light: dark; 21.5 C). Endothall treatments ranged from 1 to 10 mg ai/L (dipotassium salt) and 0.5 to 5 mg ae/L (dimethylalkylamine salt). Sixteen concentration and exposure time (CET) combinations were evaluated in each study. At 4 wk after treatment, all CET combinations significantly reduced shoot biomass (43 to 99%) of sago pondweed compared with the untreated reference. Reduction in shoot biomass was greater in plants that received higher herbicide doses and longer exposure times. In addition, more than half of the endothall CET combinations controlled sago pondweed by at least 90%, with some providing > 98% control. At the endothall CETs evaluated, regrowth of sago pondweed could occur after 4 wk, and some level of retreatment might be required to maintain plant control throughout the growing season. Results indicate that endothall shows promise as an alternative vegetation management tool in flowing-water environments.																			0890-037X	1550-2740				JAN-MAR	2008	22	1					146	150		10.1614/WT-07-121.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1614/WT-07-121.1													WOS:000254237700026
J	Topcu, A; Pulatsue, S				Topcu, Akasya; Pulatsue, Serap			Phosphorus fractions in sediment profiles of the eutrophic Lake Mogan, Turkey	FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN												This study was conducted between July 2004 and June 2005 to determine the seasonal and spatial patterns of phosphorus in the littoral sediment of Lake Mogan, and its potential release into the lake water. Total phosphorus and phosphorus fractions in the sediment and overlying water samples were taken mainly from a selected station in the lake, and additionally, some chemical and physical parameters were measured. The amount of released phosphorus was estimated using the total filterable orthophosphate concentrations related to the sediment pore as well as overlying waters with the water content of the sediment, and the diffusion coefficient depending on the temperature. During the research period, sediment phosphorus release fluctuated between 0.002-0.062 mu g.m(-2)d(-1) reaching a minimum in November and a maximum in June. The estimated values of phosphorus release into the lake quantitatively suggest that the effect of sediment over the trophic level of the lake was minimal. During the research period, total phosphorus (TP) concentrations of the sediment samples varied between 286.00 mu g g(-1) DW and 892.25 mu g g(-1) DW, and the trophic level of the lake was found to be eutrophic. The greater proportion of phosphorus fractions preventing phosphorus release into the lake was estimated to be organically-bound (Org approximate to P; 36%), and this fraction was followed by the calcium-bound (Ca approximate to P; 35%), iron+aluminium-bound (Fe+Al approximate to P; 16%) and carbonate-bound (CO3 approximate to P; 13%) phosphor-us fractions, respectively. With regard to low-sediment phosphorus release into the lake, the iron+aluminium-bound fraction (Fe+Al approximate to P) was effective because of the high iron content of the sediment (13450-44450 mu g C, g(-1) DW). During the research, another effectual component in the low-release of phosphorus was a high TFe/TP ratio (mean 45.33). High sediment clay content and macrophyte presence at the station were the other effective factors of low-sediment phosphorus release. In this study, the internal phosphorus load was estimated to be 43 kg y(-1) for the lake's area, and it was determined that in order to protect the trophic level of the lake, a priority monitoring programme should be carried out, while phosphorus adsorption kinetics are examined.

Induced production of MTs in a wide variety of organisms exposed to heavy metals has made them popular exposure indicators. While it has been postulated that the three different isoforms of MT play different physiologic roles, methods to discern induction separately have not been available. The development of real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) primers and TaqMan probes to measure the two MT isoforms found in salmonid fish are described. Assuming a high degree of homology between the isoforms and within different groups of salmonids, the sequences for MT-I and MT-II from rainbow trout were used to develop primers and probes for lake trout using the Primer3 program. Two sections of each isoform that varied by only a few nucleotides were targeted. SYBR Green validated the primer specificity, and melt curve analysis further ensured that only one product was amplified. Analysis of archived samples from fish captured in unmanipulated reference lakes or from lakes experimentally treated with cadmium or ethynylestradiol (EE2) afforded an examination of seasonal and contaminant influences on MT-I and MT-II mRNA expression.

To transform proxy data into climate parameter values, standardisation procedures are defined and described. As each type of biotic and abiotic proxy provides its own climate parameter a detailed climate reconstruction may be obtained. The 'Multi-Proxy DataBase for Palaeoclimate Reconstruction' is a specially designed computer database that facilitates data processing and management of Weichselian climate proxies. This paper describes the application of multi-proxy evidence to reconstruct the climate across lowland northwest and central Europe during the interval 41-38 BP. For this period the mean temperature of the warmest month is estimated at 10 to 11 degrees C and the mean temperature of the coldest month ranges from -27 to -20 degrees C. The annual range suggests a cold continental setting with an estimated mean annual temperature between -9 and -4 degrees C. A north to south transition from (dis)continuous permafrost to seasonally frozen ground is suggested by periglacial evidence.

Ex Steud.) were studied in the littoral zones of two human-made lakes in the Trebon Basin (South Bohemia, Czech Republic): (1) Opatovicky fishpond, a 500-year-old fishpond, and (2) Halamky sand pit, a new lake formed by sand extraction in the 1970-1990s. Clones were identified using the RAPD method within morphologically different stands. The clones were propagated vegetatively and cultivated under comparable conditions in a common garden experiment for one vegetation season. Morphological and growth characteristics of the cultivated plants were recorded and compared with those found in the original reed stands. The younger (30-year old) population was genotypically more diverse than the older (500-year old) population. In addition, the younger population demonstrated correspondence of genotypic and phenotypic variation, while the older did not. The results indicate that the genetically determined morphological features (especially shoot length) are manifested more fully in the phenotype of the plants of the younger (Halamky) population, whereas environmental factors affect the phenotype to a greater extent in the older (Opatovicky) population.

In our research, we measured the ice thickness of the Planpincieux Glacier (North-west Italy) and detected the bedrock topography using ground-penetrating radar. Additionally, we investigated the glacier surface morphology using structure from motion and the glacier kinematics using digital image correlation of terrestrial images. A digital terrain analysis showed evidence of recurrent crevasses whose position corresponded to bedrock steps. On average, since 2014, their positions varied between 6 and 14 m and were 40 +/- 8 m downstream of the bedrock steps. Bedrock and glacier topography presented out-of-phase correlated undulations that approximately fit a sinusoidal function of different amplitude. Moreover, we show the morphological evolution of an unstable sector whose thickness at the end of the ablation seasons has remained approximately constant since 2014. Contrarily, the ice melting during the 2020 ablation season caused a volume loss of > 30%. Since, in general, the damages provoked by a potential ice avalanche depend primarily on the involved volume, this finding demonstrates that frequent morphology monitoring is essential for correct glacial hazard assessment.

However, the understanding about the dynamics of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic components of picoplankton in shallow eutrophic freshwater environments is still poor. Very few studies in these ecosystems reveal the taxonomic composition of picoeukaryotes. The main objective of this study was to investigate the seasonal dynamics of phototrophic picoplankton with the emphasis on the eukaryote community composition in a large shallow, eutrophic lake of the northern temperate zone (Lake Vortsjarv). Phytoplankton pigments were employed to determine the taxonomic composition of photoautotrophic picoplankton. We found out that photoautotrophic picoplankton constitutes an important part of the phytoplankton community in Lake Vortsjarv and its contribution can be highly variable (from similar to 9.3% to similar to 39%) in different years. The eukaryotic photoautotrophic picoplankton was dominated by diatoms followed by chrysophytes and other minor groups. Picoeukaryotes were prevailing in low-light conditions and low temperatures as their predominance in the picoplankton community was tightly linked to the presence or absence of ice cover. Ice cover strongly suppressed the growth of picocyanobacteria. Total phosphorus, turbidity and metazooplankton abundance had a clear relationship with photoautotrophic picoplankton chlorophyll a.

J	Muhammetoglu, AB; Soyupak, S				Muhammetoglu, AB; Soyupak, S			A three-dimensional water quality-macrophyte interaction model for shallow lakes	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												A dynamic three-dimensional water quality model for macrophyte-dominated shallow lakes was proposed and tested. The proposed model is capable of simulating macrophytes and its interactions with water quality constituents such as dissolved oxygen (DO), organic nitrogen, ammonia, nitrate, organic phosphorus, orthophosphate, biochemical oxygen demand, phytoplankton and the sediment layer in shallow lakes. An existing two-dimensional hydrodynamic model has been utilized in conjunction with the water quality model to simulate water levels, velocities and flow rates. The modelled macrophyte processes are photosynthesis, respiration, mortality and excretion. Hourly simulation of photosynthesis process has been realized. The hourly simulations need special attention to predict diurnal variations of DO in macrophyte dominated lakes. The proposed water quality simulation model was subjected to calibration, verification and prediction processes using the data collected from Mogan Lake, Turkey. Mogan Lake exhibits wide variations of macrophyte biomass seasonally. The lake also exhibits highly variable DO levels both seasonally and diurnally. Statistical error quantification methods have been utilized to test the goodness of fit between the water quality model predictions and field measurements. Good agreement has been achieved between model predictions and measurements. Moreover, uncertainty analysis has been carried out for macrophyte and DO constituents. The analysis showed that the magnitude of the saturated growth rate of macrophyte is the most sensitive model parameter both for macrophyte and DO. The proposed water quality simulation model gave some promising initial results as a management tool to predict the expected reductions for the undesired consequences of eutrophication problem.

The fossil remains studied consist of mainly dissociated bones and teeth, belonging to 28 species, which show selective anatomical representation and characteristic types of damage (fragmentation, etching, puncture marks), which are documented quantitatively. Predation and scavenging were important factors in the accumulation of the assemblage, with little subaerial weathering. The main predators are identified as the mammals Paramiacis sp. and Amphiperatherium species B, both present as fossils and themselves also predated, plus two possible owls not represented in the fauna. Scavenging is attributed to the predators, plus glirids, possibly nyctitheres and insects. The accumulation of remains in the lake environment is interpreted to result from seasonal retreat and advance of the lake margin, with minimal hydraulic transport. Comparison is made with a previous study of a similar micromammalian assemblage in the younger Priabonian Osborne Member, whose depositional environment is a floodplain pond. The similarities and differences are assessed in the context of a similar assemblage, although with a different dominant mammalian predator. Low post-mortem transport in each case is shown to have resulted in the preservation of an assemblage, which closely reflects the original community with some of its key trophic interactions.																			1935-3952	1094-8074				2022 MAY	2022										10.26879/1214	http://dx.doi.org/10.26879/1214		MAY 2022											WOS:000804379400001

Use of a modified form factor to compare condition among North American lake sturgeon stocks	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY					3rd Annual Conference on Sturgeons of the North American Chapter of the World-Sturgeon-Conservation-Society	AUG 31-SEP 02, 2010	World Sturgeon Conservat Soc (WSCS), N Amer Chapter (NAC), Bozeman, MT		World Sturgeon Conservat Soc (WSCS), N Amer Chapter (NAC)			In fisheries management it is often useful to compare length and weight relationships or condition among populations across a species range. Currently, the most commonly used metric for this is relative weight (Wr), although some problems have arisen with the use of Wr including the impact of seasonal changes in body condition due to reproduction, and length-related biases in standard weight equations. We propose the use of a modified form factor (mFF) based on the regression of log10a vs beta (weightlength model parameters) within a species, to provide a quick and meaningful comparison of mean condition among North American lake sturgeon populations. We used the a and beta parameters from 63 lake sturgeon weightlength models from 43 lake sturgeon populations from throughout their range in the equation to calculate the mFF for the 63 samples. Modified form factor values of juvenile, adult male, and female lake sturgeon from the Winnebago System, Wisconsin, in various stages of reproductive development had a 98.0% correlation with their respective relative condition values over a wide range of mFF values. Simple t-tests on sets of mFF values can be used to test the condition differences between populations or sub-samples within populations. Lake sturgeon from the Winnebago System, Wisconsin, USA were found to show WL relationships best described in two stanzas: all juveniles <71.1 cm, and juveniles and adults combined, but separate by sex, =71.1 cm. Likelihood ratio tests found significant differences between male and female (>71 cm) WL models; juvenile (=71 cm) and male (>71 cm) models; and juvenile (=71 cm) and female (>71 cm) models.

During 173 days, diel DO cycles were measured in situ along with the main driving variables of pH, wind speed (WS), and net solar radiation (Rn) in a temperate shallow lake. Best-fit multiple non-linear regression (MNLR) models of diel DO time series were built and validated on a monthly basis, with R(2) values ranging from 42.4% in September to 95.4% in November for validation. The strong relationship between diel DO and pH (r = 0.6) appeared to be related to the patterns of ecosystem productivity and respiration, and sensitivity of decomposing bacteria to changes in pH. pH-driven lake metabolism appears to have significant implications for diel and seasonal lake metabolism in a changing global environment.

Knowledge of the overlap of spawning migrations of sea lampreys and other fish species are vital for the efficient operation of the Commission's barrier program. The migration of sea lamprey spawners was compared with the migration of four other fish species using trap captures at electric barriers on eight Lake Superior tributaries during 1954 to 1979. The passage of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax), longnose suckers (Catostomus catostomus), and white suckers (Catostomus commersoni) prior to the capture of sea lampreys was quantified as the proportion of the annual catch of each species. Average passage over all streams and years was smallest (5%) for longnose sucker and largest (21%) for rainbow smelt. Passage prior to first sea lamprey catch was significantly different among rivers for all four species and significantly different among years for rainbow trout. Much of the variability in annual passage was unexplained by river or year effects. It is suggested that stream-specific information on run times of sea lampreys and other fishes be used to define timing of seasonal barrier operations. If barrier operations are timed to block the entire sea lamprey spawning run, then fish passage devices are needed to pass rainbow trout, rainbow smelt, longnose suckers, and white suckers.																			0380-1330						2003	29			1			403	409		10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70503-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70503-6													WOS:000221321300030

Concentrations of ubiquitous pigments (beta-carotene, pheophytin a) were correlated to total algal biomass standing crop (r = 0.56-0.65; P < 0.01) during the ice-free seasons, but not to carbon fixation or water-column chlorophyll (Chi). Indicator pigments were correlated to ice-free season algal biomass for cyanobacteria (echinenone, aphanizophyll) and chlorophytes (lutein-zeaxanthin, pheophytin b)(r = 0.53-0.55, P < 0.05), weakly correlated for cryptophytes (alloxanthin, alpha-carotene; r = 0.32-0.40, P < 0.10), but were uncorrelated for chrysophytes and diatoms (fucoxanthin, Chl c) or dinoflagellates (peredinin). Premanipulation concentrations of fossil pigments (nmol pigment .(g organic matter)(-1)) from green algae and filamentous cyanobacteria (myxoxanthophyll) increased 4- to 10-fold in response to eutrophication of Lake 227. N-2-fixing cyanobacteria (recorded as aphanizophyll) replaced chlorophytes after the nitrogen additions decreased threefold in 1975. In contrast, accumulation rates of pigments (nmol pigment . m(-2) . yr(-1)) were rarely correlated with algal standing crop or production and were less satisfactory than fossil concentrations for the purpose of detecting changes in phytoplankton community composition.

Microbial profile and its changing rates of Lake Burullus, Egypt as wastewater receiving body	WATER AND ENVIRONMENT JOURNAL												Understanding the impacts of seasonal variations on fate and distribution of natural and introduced microbes are important for proper public health, risk assessment and water management of Lake Burullus, Egypt (LB) as water receiving body. The effects of mixing processes on microbial loads in Lake and discharged aquacultural wastewater (AQ) and agricultural drainages (AG) were assessed. Microbiological examinations of discharged waters in this study revealed that total bacterial count (TBC), and total coliform count (TCC) were significantly high at P0.05 in aquacultural wastewater than both LB and AG. Total fecal coliform count (TFC) and total fecal streptococcus (TFS) were determined and showed that AG has significantly high at P0.05 comparing to both LB and AQ. No seasonal differences in-between all indictors values of LB, while AG wastewater values were mostly higher than both AQ and LB water samples with declining attitude between sampling points. In case of TBC, TCC and TFC, the microbial loads of lake water were highly affected by receiving water but in case of TSF, the water shows no affects. Contrary, for discharged waters, both show reduction in count that is meaning of dilution processes. As excessive discharge of raw wastewater may present a risk related to high increased rate of TBC and TCC in lake water annually by 27.8 and 33.0% at 500 m points, respectively.

Factors Controlling the Fractionation and Seasonal Mobility Variations of Ga and In in Systems Impacted by Acidic Thermal Waters: Effects of Thermodynamics and Bacterial Activity	AQUATIC GEOCHEMISTRY												This work assessed both the fractionation and the seasonal mobility variations of Ga and In in systems impacted by acidic thermal waters. This was accomplished by performing thermodynamic calculations using the PHREEQC algorithm and by assessing the activity of acidophilic iron-oxidizing bacteria. The pH of the Kusatsu thermal waters in Gunma Prefecture, central Japan, is rapidly increased following the addition of a lime suspension. After an abrupt pH increase, under which conditions free ions of Ga and In and their complexes with Cl- and SO4 (2-) exist only in negligible quantities, the majority of dissolved Ga and In is removed by sorption onto suspended hydrous ferric oxides (HFOs). These HFOs are then transported to an artificial lake without significant sedimentation along the river. Subsequently, the suspended HFOs settle out and are added to sediments without significant fractionation between Ga and In. The Tamagawa thermal waters in Akita Prefecture, northeast Japan, are also treated with lime. However, complete neutralization requires mixing with some tributary streams, leading to a gradual downstream increase in pH. Dissolved Ga is, in general, sorbed by HFOs in upstream areas, leading to wide dispersal of Ga across the entire watershed. In comparison, In is transported to the lake inlet predominantly as a Cl- complex species without significant removal along the river, with the majority being precipitated in an artificial lake, where Cl- concentrations are too low to form stable complex species with In, and thus, dissolved In is sorbed by HFOs. As a result, In is effectively concentrated within downstream lakebed sediments, whereas Ga is dispersed along the river. Seasonal variations in Ga mobility within the Tamagawa field between snowmelt and low-flow seasons are primarily controlled by pH, because hydrolysis reactions of these metals, which are related to sorption reactions, tend to occur in the upstream regions in the snowmelt season. However, under warmer conditions, HFO formation preferably occurs due to the activity of acidophilic iron-oxidizing bacteria. Thus, under similar pH variations, dissolved Ga is more effectively removed by HFOs during warmer seasons. On the contrary, because HFOs are abundantly formed in low-flow season, even under colder conditions, before In hydrolysis reaction starts to occur, In mobility is less affected by water temperature and then bacterial activity.

J	Ratcliff, DR; Wurtsbaugh, WA; Zustak, J				Ratcliff, Donald R.; Wurtsbaugh, Wayne A.; Zustak, Joseph			Evaluating the Effectiveness of Grassbed Treatments as Habitat for Juvenile Black Bass in a Drawdown Reservoir	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Many reservoirs in arid regions experience highly variable water levels caused by seasonal inflow fluctuations and designated outflow requirements. At Shasta Lake, California, managers plant cereal-grain grassbeds on exposed drawdown shorelines to increase juvenile fish habitat, localize productivity, and increase invertebrate fish prey. To determine the efficacy of these plantings, the abundance of juvenile black basses Micropterus spp. (20-55 mm standard length) and the amount of periphyton and macroinvertebrate prey were compared among three treatment types: (1) planted grassbeds of cereal barley Hordeum vulgare; (2) artificial rope grassbeds, which eliminated physical deterioration and nutrient release; and (3) nonplanted control sites with predominately sand and gravel substrates. In comparison with control areas, juvenile black bass abundance averaged 54 times higher in planted grassbeds and 230 times higher in artificial grassbeds. Periphyton (chlorophyll a) and benthic invertebrate biomass did not differ significantly between planted grassbeds and control sites. In artificial grassbeds, periphyton was more than two times the control levels, and benthic invertebrate biomass was more than 12 times tire control levels. We conclude that the long-term availability of physical structure, rather than nutrient release associated with decomposition of grassbed materials, drives use and effectiveness of grassbed treatments. Future management decisions in drawdown reservoirs should emphasize increasing long-term availability and integrity of physical habitat for juvenile fishes in the littoral zone.

The aim was to simulate the effect of increased concentrations of DOC that will be a predicted effect of increased temperature and precipitation. The study aimed to provide information on the overall effects of such increased levels of DOC on the pelagic food-web, as well as the increased attenuation of UV-radiation (UV-R) caused by increased DOC. The biomass development of phytoplankton, heterotrophic bacteria and ciliates from 15. July (shortly after ice-off) to 8. August revealed a consistent pattern across all enclosures. Initial phytoplankton biomass decreased from maxima around 600 mug Cl-1 towards 50 mug Cl-1 by the end of July. Similarly, ciliate biomass decreased from similar to100 to 5 mug Cl-1, while heterotrophic bacteria decreased from initially 280 mug Cl-1 to biomasses near 100 mug Cl-1. Over the same period, zooplankton biomass (almost a monoculture of Daphnia tenebrosa) increased from < 40 to some 170 mug Cl-1. These patterns were reflected also in decreasing absolute production of bacteria and phytoplankton, while production: biomass ratio remained fairly constant. In general, the study demonstrated a very dynamic system over the brief ice-free season, where Daphnia grazing had a strong impact on the unicellular biota. Additions of DOC initially stimulated planktonic production, yet this effect was soon overruled by Daphnia grazing. This stimulating effect could be a result both of increased UV-R attenuation and some growth stimulating effect. Since no corresponding stimulating effect was observed in the bag shielded with Mylar filter to screen off UV-B, the latter cause seems most likely.

J	Dumont, HJ; Segers, H				Dumont, HJ; Segers, H			Estimating lacustrine zooplankton species richness and complementarity	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Literature and original information reveals that lakes at any latitude may be expected to lodge +50 spp. of cladocerans, against +150 spp, of rotifers in the temperate, and +210 spp. in the tropical zone. Collector's curves can be used to estimate the number of species present at any point in time in a lake. Hyperbolic regression and Chao's non-parametric estimator were used to extrapolate from species numbers observed to true numbers present. Estimates for rotifers were better (had lower variances) than for cladocerans, and both were better in the temperate than in the tropical zone, where more species co-exist than in the temperate zone but where many more species are rare. Approximate numbers of samples required to approach true instantaneous species richness were calculated. However, a test in a (sub)tropical lake in Brasil where such an 'asymptotic' number of samples was collected and examined failed to reduce the variance, while recording a number of species higher than predicted. We conclude that seasonal succession was still significant here, and that more research is needed to determine the minimum number of sampling repeats needed for a full census. Lakes with an ATBI (All Taxa Biological Inventory) for rotifers and cladocerans were compared by a complementarity index. This revealed geographic gradients between lakes, strong for cladocerans, but less so for rotifers. It is argued that this mainly reflects a difference in the state of taxonomic advancement between these two groups, and that the theory of cosmopolitanism must be abandoned for both.

J	González, EJ; Ortaz, M; Peñaherrera, C; de Infante, A				González, EJ; Ortaz, M; Peñaherrera, C; de Infante, A			Physical and chemical features of a tropical hypertrophic reservoir permanently stratified	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Physical and chemical parameters of Pao-Cachinche reservoir (Venezuela) were measured in four stations (S1-S4) during an eighteen months period from September 1997 to February 1999. The tributaries of this reservoir introduce high amounts of nutrients from domestic wastewaters and from poultry and pig farms located in the basin. Thermal stratification was well established throughout the study period. Mountainous topography protects the water surface from mechanical action of wind, preventing water mixing. Hypoxic/anoxic conditions prevailed from 6-7 m depth down to the bottom in the limnetic stations. A strong smell of H2S was detected below the 10 m level. The low water transparency (max. 1.5 m) may be mainly attributed to a high biogenic turbidity. Water salinity was low, as the maximum conductivity measured (260 muS cm(-1)) suggests. The water was alkaline in the upper layers during the day time (pH > 8.0), due to the high phytoplanktonic productivity, whereas in deeper layers, where decomposition processes predominate, pH was acidic (close to 6.0). Orthophosphate concentrations were high, reaching maximal concentrations in the deeper part of the reservoir (greater than 800 mug l(-1)). Total phosphorus exceeded 1000 mug l(-1) in the hypolimnion during the dry season. Ammonia was the dominant inorganic nitrogen species, and its values were greater than 4000 mug l(-1) in the hypolimnetic layer during the dry season. Nitrates and nitrites were present in relatively low concentrations, except for the Paito stream entrance, where nitrate concentrations remained above 260 mug l(-1). Pao-Cachinche reservoir can be considered hypertrophic, according to Salas & Martino's criteria for tropical warm lakes, and could be classified as meromictic and warm monomictic, according to Lewis tropical lake types.

J	Pajuste, K; Frey, J				Pajuste, K; Frey, J			Nitrogen mineralisation in podzol soils under boreal Scots pine and Norway spruce stands	PLANT AND SOIL												N mineralisation was investigated in the mor humus layer of a podzol at a forested catchment area of Saarejarve Lake in Eastern Estonia. The investigated areas were pine ( Rhodococcum understorey) and spruce ( Vaccinium understorey) stands, which are permanent sample plots of an integrated monitoring network. The seasonal pattern of net N mineralisation was studied by incubating undisturbed cores of mor humus ( 0 - 8 cm) in buried polyethylene bags in situ. Samples were collected and incubated between July 1996 and April 1998. The period of incubation was approximately 1 month, except for wintertime when incubation lasted till thawing of ground (similar to 5 months). The amounts of mineral nitrogen formed during monthly incubations in vegetation period vary considerably (0.4-8.7 kg ha(-1)). About 70% of the variation of net ammonification could be explained by environmental factors temperature, initial moisture and pH. Ammonium was the dominant form of mineral nitrogen, which is typical for mor humus. The rate of nitrification was very low, and most of the annual net nitrification occurred during just one or two months ( May - June, October) depending on site and year. Measured annual net N mineralisation was 29.2 kg ha(-1) for the spruce stand and 23.6 kg ha(-1) for the pine stand. These measures were found to be in good accordance with other N-fluxes in the ecosystem.																			0032-079X					NOV	2003	257	1					237	247		10.1023/A:1026222831694	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1026222831694													WOS:000186046200023
J	Warnock, RE; Gieskes, WWC; van Laar, S				Warnock, RE; Gieskes, WWC; van Laar, S			Regional and seasonal differences in light absorption by yellow substance in the Southern Bight of the North Sea	JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH												Absorption spectra (250-800 nm) of yellow substance were measured in 1993 and 1994 along five onshore-offshore transects in the Southern Eight of the North Sea in different seasons. All spectra had a common shape, so the amount of yellow substance could be established using one reference wavelength as a proxy variable. The exponential slope parameter at 380 nm (S) of the absorption spectra ranged from -0.016 to -0.023 per nm when regression was based upon the 250-650 nm wavelength range; values were 25% lower when fitting was performed over the more restricted waveband 360-540 nm, partly due to a minor shoulder at 260-275 nm in all spectra. The concentration of yellow substance, expressed as the absorption coefficient at 380 nm (a(380); m(-1)), varied over an order of magnitude, from low values down to 0.17 m(-1) in the English Channel, up to 1.00-1.25 m(-1) near the Rhine and Scheldt outflow, to maxima of up to 1.75 m(-1) in the neritic-estuarine waters at the entrance to the shallow Wadden Sea. This regional distribution pattern was in agreement with the known water-mass circulation and with the location of sources of yellow substance: highest concentrations close to the shore under the influence of freshwater inflow, lower values with increasing distance from the coast, where Atlantic Ocean water is the major water-mass component. No significant seasonal variation in yellow-substance concentration was found anywhere when a correction was applied for salinity. Extrapolation to zero salinity yielded an absorption coefficient at 380 nm of 5.38 m(-1) for the freshwater input at both the Texel and Walcheren transects, but of 3.29 m(-1) at the Noordwijk transect, reflecting differences in yellow-substance concentration between the Rhine, the Meuse, and Lake IJssel, as previously noted in fluorescence measurements. Yellow-substance concentration was not only correlated with salinity but also, albeit much less, with chlorophyll concentrations; the contribution of phytoplankton to the yellow-substance pool was marginal but significant. A relation appeared to exist between yellow-substance absorbance at 380 nm and yellow-substance fluorescence intensity; fluorescence measurements in the southern North Sea can be translated to absorption (more appropriate for ocean colour detection by remote sensing) by equating I mFl unit to an absorption coefficient at 380 nm of 0.056 m(-1), and using the exponential relation a(ys)(lambda) = a(ys)(lambda(ref)) exp(-S(lambda - lambda(ref))) for extrapolation to UV-Vis spectral absorption.

J	Polivka, KM; Friedli, LM; Green, EC				Polivka, Karl M.; Friedli, Lisa M.; Green, Elizabeth C.			Stream inflow and predation risk affect littoral habitat selection by benthic fish	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. We examined small, fishless headwater streams to determine whether transport of macroinvertebrates into the littoral zone of an oligotrophic lake augmented food availability for Cottus asper, an abundant predatory fish in our study system. We sampled fish and macroinvertebrates during the recruitment and growth season of 2years, either monthly (2004) or bi-monthly (2005), to observe whether stream inputs increased prey availability and whether variation in total macroinvertebrate biomass was tracked by fish. 2. Observations from eight headwater streams indicated that streams did not increase the total macroinvertebrate biomass in the shallow littoral zone at stream inflows, relative to adjacent plots without stream inputs (controls). The taxonomic composition of stream macroinvertebrates drifting toward the lake differed from that in the littoral lake benthos itself, although there was no evidence of any species change in the composition of the littoral benthos brought about by stream inputs. 3. Although streams made no measurable contribution to the biomass or taxonomic composition of the littoral macroinvertebrate benthos, there was substantial temporal variation in biomass among the eight sites for each of the (n=7) sample periods during which observations were made. Variation in total biomass was primarily a function of bottom slope and benthic substrata in the lake habitats. Dominant taxonomic groups were Baetidae, Ephemerellidae (two genera), Leptophlebiidae, Chironomidae (three subfamilies) and Perlodidae, although we did not determine the specific substratum affinities of each taxon. 4. Mixed effects linear models identified a significant interaction between macroinvertebrate biomass and plot type (stream inflow vs. control) associated with fish abundance. Across the observed range of macroinvertebrate biomass, fish showed a significant preference for stream inflows, but more closely tracked food availability in the controls. For young-of-the-year (YOY), a negative effect of temperature was also included in the model, and we observed lower temperatures at stream inflows. However, abundance of predatory adults affected habitat selection for YOY. Lake-bottom slope also accounted for variation in abundance in both fish models. 5. Our results suggest that the effect of fishless headwater streams on downstream fish may not always be through direct delivery of food. In this study system, fish preferred stream inflow plots, but this preference interacted with macroinvertebrate biomass in a manner that was difficult to explain. For YOY, predation risk was related to the preference for stream inflows, although the specific factor that mitigates predation risk remains poorly understood.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				MAY	2013	58	5					986	994		10.1111/fwb.12101	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12101													WOS:000317625900011
J	Fritsen, CH; Priscu, JC				Fritsen, CH; Priscu, JC			Cyanobacterial assemblages in permanent ice covers on Antarctic lakes: Distribution growth rate, and temperature response of photosynthesis	JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												The proliferation of microalgae in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica is intricately linked to the seasonal cycle involving the freezing and melting of water. Anecdotal observations and preliminary sampling have found cyanobacterial cells in ice covers on lakes in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, and several of these ice covers are known to undergo seasonal freeze-thaw cycles. Therefore, we sought to determine the distribution and abundance of cyanobacterial assemblages in several permanent ice covers throughout the McMurdo Dry Valleys and to determine their rates of growth and their photosynthetic physiologies upon encountering liquid water. We found that the majority of the permanent ice covers contained cyanobacterial assemblages in close association with sedimentary material. Cyanobacterial biomass was conspicuously absent in sediment-free ice covers, suggesting that the seasonal interaction between the sediments, ice, and solar radiation present the necessary liquid water environment for cyanobacterial growth. All assemblages exhibited extremely low rates of photosynthesis when first exposed to liquid water. Despite the low rates of photosynthesis, a large proportion (41 %) of the photosynthate was incorporated into protein, indicating that the cells were undergoing efficient net cellular growth. The short-term response (24 h) of photosynthesis to a range of temperatures showed optimum rates occurring at temperatures >15 degrees C, which is similar to those of psychrotrophic cyanobacteria isolates from soil and stream habitats, which we believe provides the inoculum for the in- ice habitats.																				1529-8817				AUG	1998	34	4					587	597		10.1046/j.1529-8817.1998.340587.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1529-8817.1998.340587.x													WOS:000075712400004

However, most studies have focused on the Neolithic Age, with limited evidence for earlier periods. The Shalongka (SLK) site on the northeastern QTP spans the Epipaleolithic to Bronze Age and contains cultural deposits, so provides a good basis for unraveling the evolutionary history of the human-land relationship. In this study, we sampled the 420-cm-thick section T1406E at the SLK site and undertook lithologic stratigraphic description and analysis of grain size, redness, magnetic susceptibility, geochemical elements, pollen and charcoal. Dating control was provided by accelerated mass spectrometry C-14 and optically stimulated luminescence methods. Results show that SLK site was affected by the local fluvial sedimentary environment. The absolute dating results of the SLK site have revealed that humans occupied the site during the Epipaleolithic (8.5-7.3 cal ka BP), Yangshao culture (5.9-5.1 ka) and Qijia Culture (4.1-3.9 cal ka BP). Pollen analysis showed that the humans lived in a landscape that was predominated by forest-steppe. Consolidating with multidisciplinary evidence, we learned that Epipaleolithic sites were occupied by microlithic hunter-gatherers and comprised by relatively fixed seasonal central campsites, and their mobility was significantly decreased from the early to late period. Subsequently, farmers of the Yangshao culture migrated from the low elevation (Chinese Loess Plateau) to the upper Yellow River valleys on the QTP and founded the earliest settlement villages (~5.9 ka) on the QTP. People of the Qijia culture adopted diversified survival strategies under the settled lifestyle. In all, we infered that SLK site may play an important role in the communication and integration between different people and cultures.

Morbidity and mortality were monitored every third day during the breeding season from 1994 to 1996 from inside a tunnel-and-blind system. Affected eggs and birds were collected for examination and diagnosis. The cause of mortality was determined for 105 eggs, 178 nestlings (less than or equal to 4-wk-old), 1393 post-nestling chicks (>4-wk-old), and 10 adults. The main causes of mortality were infertility or embryonal death, avian predation, displacement of eggs and chicks from the nest, starvation from sibling competition, Newcastle disease, coyote predation, human-induced suffocation, and entrapment. In 49% of the cases, avian predation and displacement from the nest of eggs or nestlings was associated with human disturbance. Thirty-six nestlings, 40 post-nestling chicks, and three adults were examined for the presence of parasites. Contracaecum spiculigerum was found in the proventriculus; Amphimerus elongatus in the liver; Piagetiella incomposita in the gular pouch; Eidmanniella pellucida, Pectinopygus farallonii, and Ceratophyllus lari in the plumage; and Thermyzon sp, in the nasal and oral cavity. Contracaecum spiculigerum was associated with ulcerative gastritis, A. elongatus with multifocal hepatitis and bile duct hyperplasia, and P, incomposita with ulcerative stomatitis, but these lesions were not considered fatal. Other diseases included beak deformity, abnormal rotation of the carpel joint, hypopigmentation, and eye loss. Overall mortality of cormorant chicks between hatching and the end of the breeding season varied from 25 to 48%. The most important causes of mortality were Newcastle disease, which killed 21% of hatched chicks in 1995, sibling competition (maximum 12% in 1994), and coyote predation (2% in 1994).

Its population status, habitat characteristics, and relation to historical and current human land use are investigated. The species has a restricted and fragmented distribution pattern. Five locations, four within Pamvotida Lake 2 basin and one in Lake Paramythia, cover a total of 0.12m(2). It is strongly dependent on wet grasslands, flooded on a seasonal basis. The greatest population density is recorded in the site with the greatest diversity of dominant plant species. Ch. lacustris is estimated to have lost 85-99% of its habitat during the last 50 years due to wetland drainage. The main threat to the species survival is further habitat loss by urbanisation around Pamvotida Lake and by land conversion to agriculture in Paramythia Lake, even though both sites belong to the Natura 2000 network. The species status is Critically Endangered and it should be listed in Annex 11 of the Habitat Directive (92/43/EEC) as a priority species for conservation. Restoring wet grasslands, protecting them from further urbanisation and drainage, and monitoring species population are the main measures proposed for its conservation.					; Kati, Vassiliki/AAB-9418-2020	Kati, Vassiliki/0000-0003-3357-4556; 													1366-638X	1572-9753				MAR	2006	10	1					65	74		10.1007/s10841-005-2642-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10841-005-2642-y													WOS:000235150200007

Vegetation control, burned windrows, high-speed mixing. bedding plow, breaking plow. and disk trenching treatments were evaluated on a site with high brush potential, relatively dense soils, and average nutrient availability. This article summarizes impacts of treatments on soil density, soil chemical properties, and tree nutrition 5, 10 and 15 years after treatments and on the growth of planted white spruce (Picea glauca [Moench] Voss) after 15 growing seasons. Mixing, bedding plow, and disk trenching treatments decreased soil density and improved nutrient availability relative to no treatment, and effects were still significant after 15 years. Soil carbon and nitrogen increased substantially over time in treatments where there was a vigorous re-establishment of the plant community after disturbance. Although vegetation control did not improve soil physical or chemical properties relative to no treatment, it ranked among the top four treatments, with burned windrows, mixing, and breaking plow, in terms of white spruce growth after 15 years.																			0742-6348	1938-3762				MAR	2006	23	1					35	46		10.1093/njaf/23.1.35	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/njaf/23.1.35													WOS:000236288900006
J	Cook, CB; Orlob, GT; Huston, DW				Cook, CB; Orlob, GT; Huston, DW			Simulation of wind-driven circulation in the Salton Sea: implications for indigenous ecosystems	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The Salton Sea, the largest 'man-made' water body wholly within California, was formed in 1904 as the result of a levee failure along the Colorado River. Initially, flow into the Salton `Sink' created a fresh water lake about 24 m deep with a water surface about 85 m below the level of the ocean. Salinity of the water body, at first roughly the same as the river, rose rapidly due to solution of previously accumulated residual salt, then following levee repair, adjusted to the combined influence of agricultural drainage accretions and evaporative losses. Water levels adjusted accordingly, at first declining then rising slowly until the mid 1930s when a level about 75 m below ocean level was reached. Thereafter, both water levels and salinity gradually rose, so that at present the surface elevation of the Sea stands near -69.5 m and salinity is approaching 45 g l(-1), about 30% above ocean salinity. The Salton Sea Authority is seeking practical methods for reducing water levels and controlling salinity within ranges that will protect beneficial uses of the Sea, its adjacent lands, and its indigenous ecosystems, both aquatic and avian. Proposed solutions include various physical changes in the bathymetry and configuration of the Sea, especially its southern basin. Because circulation in the Sea is driven primarily by wind stresses imposed on the water surface, and circulation changes are likely to affect the Sea's quality and ecology, a methodology for quantifying the effects of specific alternatives is required. For this purpose a mathematical model for simulation of the hydrodynamic behavior of the Sea has been developed, calibrated to data gathered by a field investigation conducted in 1997, and applied to alternative schemes that will isolate sections of the southern basin, thus changing the natural wind induced circulation in areas that are ecologically sensitive. The Salton Sea Hydrodynamic/Water Quality Model is constructed using the finite element method to represent the bathymetry of the Sea as it currently exists, or may subsequently be modified, in a three-dimensional grid. Given certain boundary conditions, for example wind stresses imposed on the surface, the model solves the three dimensional equations of motion and continuity, the advection-dispersion equation, and an equation of state dependent upon temperature and salinity, to obtain temporal and spatial descriptions of velocities and temperatures over a specified period of time. Using data derived from 1997 field measurements of velocities using acoustic Doppler current profilers and temperature sensors, the model was calibrated to reproduce mathematically the historic experience of field observation. The model successfully replicated principal features of the Sea's behavior, especially the persistence of a counterclockwise gyre in the southern basin and seasonal stratification. Once calibrated, the model was applied to evaluate the possible effects of changing water surface elevations in the Sea and altering its configuration to isolate sections for evaporative concentration of salts. These effects, evident in changes in velocity, were quantified with regard to their possible impacts on the aquatic habitat and the health of the Salton Sea ecology. A comparative evaluation of alternatives is presented.																			0018-8158					APR	2002	473	1-3					59	75		10.1023/A:1016517331869	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1016517331869													WOS:000177008500005
J	Schulting, RJ; Richards, MP				Schulting, RJ; Richards, MP			Dogs, ducks, deer and diet: New stable isotope evidence on Early Mesolithic dogs from the Vale of Pickering, North-East England	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE												We present new carbon and nitrogen isotope values for two domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) and an aquatic bird (Grus grus) from the Mesolithic sites of Star and Seamer Carr, Yorkshire, England. Previous measurements of the carbon isotopes of the Seamer Carr dog were undertaken by Clutton-Brock and Noe-Nygaard (1990). They interpreted the delta C-13 values as indication a partly marine diet, and suggested that this was evidence for a seasonal movement of people and their domestic dogs between the coast and the inland Seamer Carr site. Day (1996) questioned this interpretation, arguing that the dog's delta C-13 values resulted from the consumption of aquatic foods from the ancient lake in the Vale of Pickering, thereby undermining any suggestion of seasonal movements to the coast. Day's argument is based on the assumption that the freshwater lake near Seamer/Starr Carr contained delta C-13-enriched dissolved CO2 from limestone, resulting in plants and aquatic birds with values mimicking those of a marine system. Here, we re-measure the carbon and nitrogen isotope values indicate that the Seamer Carr dog did indeed consume significant amounts of marine protein, while the Star Carr dog did not. The aquatic bird did not have enriched delta C-13 values as Day predicted, and therefore we found no evidence to support Day's assumptions. Our new data supports the position that there could have been seasonal movements between the coast and inland during the Early Mesolithic at the site of Seamer Carr.					; Richards, Michael/A-9374-2008; Richards, Michael/O-3717-2016	Schulting, Rick/0000-0002-4444-766X; Richards, Michael/0000-0001-5274-8887; 													0305-4403					APR	2002	29	4					327	333		10.1006/jasc.2002.0707	http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/jasc.2002.0707													WOS:000176379300001
J	Lesack, LFW; Marsh, P; Hecky, RE				Lesack, LFW; Marsh, P; Hecky, RE			Spatial and temporal dynamics of major solute chemistry among Mackenzie Delta lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The Mackenzie Delta of the Canadian arctic is a complex environment, containing similar to 25,000 lakes, where annual river flooding may exert a considerable degree of control over the ecological characteristics of lakes in the system. The solute composition of 92 lakes representing differing frequencies and durations of flooding was determined from among three clusters of lakes distributed over a north-south (N-S) gradient along the eastern margin of the delta. The solute compositions yield an end-member system of dominant solutes (shifting among Ca(2+) plus HCO(3)(-), Mg(2+) plus HCO(3)(-), Ca(2+) plus SO(4)(2-)) in correspondence with a gradient from frequently flooded lakes to infrequently flooded lakes. This end-member system is consistent between years and along the N-S elevational gradient of the delta. The solute composition of the frequently hooded lakes appears to be stable among years, while the composition among infrequently hooded lakes is not stable. The end-member system is consistent with the seasonal dynamics in solute composition observed for three lakes, representing differing flooding regimes, plus the dynamics of the nearest main distributary channel. The dominance of local hydrological and biogeochemical processes in about one-third of the lakes in the delta, where flooding occurs less frequently than every year, is not consistent with a common paradigm where flooding from river channels is thought to dominate the annual flushing, nutrient replenishment, and reinitialization of lacustrine ecosystems on the floodplains of major world rivers.																			0024-3590					NOV	1998	43	7					1530	1543		10.4319/lo.1998.43.7.1530	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1998.43.7.1530													WOS:000077285000013

Here we report a high-resolution reconstruction of Caribbean climate based on O-18/O-16 ratios in ostracod shells from Lake Miragoane, Haiti. Our results show that the climate was dry and the lake level low during the latter part of the Younger Dryas chronozone (10.5-10 kyr BP), but that water level in the lake rose at the end of the last deglaciation (approximately 10-7 kyr BP), reflecting the wetter conditions of the early Holocene which persisted for nearly 4,000 years. Lake level declined at approximately 3.2 kyr BP with the onset of a drier climate which generally prevailed throughout the late Holocene. These long-term changes in Caribbean climate are generally similar to those found for Africa over the same period, and can be largely explained by orbitally induced (Milankovitch) variations in seasonal insolation which modified the intensity of the annual cycle. Superimposed on the orbitally forced climate trends are more abrupt climate events that result from complex, nonlinear interactions in the ocean-atmosphere system. The interpretation of Antillean biogeography and the development of Caribbean and Mesoamerican culture must be considered in the context of such shifts in climate.

The taxa identified included members of Cyanoprokaryota (8), Bacillariophyta (46), Chlorophyta (54), Euglenophyta (30), Cryptophyta (2), Dinophyta (1) and Xanthophyta (1). In the phytoplankton, Cyclotella ocellata, Aulacoseria distans, Trachelomonas hispida, T volvocina var. punctata, Cryptomonas ovata, Pediastrum spp., and Scenedesmia spp. were common organisms. Seasonal variations in phytoplankton appeared to be related to availability of light and temperature rather than various measured nutrients.

Comparison of emission rates with and without the presence of aboveground vegetation indicated that over 90% of the emission was plant-associated transport. Further evidence of this association was found in a linear correlation of CH4 emission with aboveground plant biomass (R=0.93). To test the importance of aboveground plant photosynthetic production on methane production, aboveground vegetation was clipped from sites continually over the growing season. Both emissions and dissolved pore water CH4 were reduced relative to adjacent vegetated areas. A significant correlation (R=0.93) of CH4 emissions with net CO2 exchange in this fen gives evidence of the close association between new plant production and methanogenesis.																			0886-6236	1944-9224				SEP	1992	6	3					225	231		10.1029/92GB00710	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/92GB00710													WOS:000211488400001

REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												The diet and reproduction of fish communities in three biotopes (river, stream, and lake) of the Mesa), floodplain-river complex (Puerto Abeja, Serrania de Chiribiquete National Natural Park, CaquetA, Colombia) were sampled during the "high water" level or flooding period. A total of 79 species of fishes from 15 families and four orders were collected between July and September 2000. The most important items in their diet were fruits and seeds. Approximately 46 % of captured fish were near maturity, and 35 % were mature. The feeding and reproductive behavior of these fish were consistent with other studies on migratory Amazonian species during the high water period, when the floodplain plays an important role in the availability of food and refuge. During this period the fish make use of the vast food availability to accumulate fat reserves that later produce the energy needed for gonadal maturation and breeding migrations.					; Blanco-Parra, Maria del Pilar/E-7162-2010	Blanco, Maria del Pilar/0000-0003-2492-2168; Bejarano Rodriguez, Ivonne/0000-0002-6407-1751; 													0034-7744	2215-2075				SEP	2006	54	3					853	859											18491626					WOS:000244698300017

Seasonal activity, relative abundance, and size-class structure of the american alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) in a highly disturbed inland lake	SOUTHWESTERN NATURALIST												We monitored an inland population of American alligator (Alligator mississipiensis) in Lake Raven, Huntsville State Park, Walker County, Texas from September 2000 to August 2001. We found alligators exhibited year-round activity in Lake Raven, with the lowest occurrence of alligators in December and January. The greatest numbers of alligators were surveyed in June and September. However, in September, 47% of the observed individuals were hatchlings. Water temperature was a significant predictor of alligator activity over air temperature and explained 37% of the observed variation in seasonal activity. A population index estimated that Lake Raven supported 0.19 alligators per hectare, with most of these alligators being juveniles and in the size class of 0.6 to 0.9 m. We also found alligators used all regions of the perimeter of the lake and were observed mostly 5 m from the shoreline. Because there is limited information on inland alligator populations in Texas, this study offers information on the seasonal activity, relative abundance, and size-class structure of alligators inhabiting a relatively small (85 ha) and highly disturbed inland lake. This information might be useful for future studies and comparisons with coastal alligator populations.																			0038-4909	1943-6262				SEP	2006	51	3					346	351		10.1894/0038-4909(2006)51[346:SARAAS]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1894/0038-4909(2006)51[346:SARAAS]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000240865400006

This study aims to investigate the possible pollution sources from catchments with different types of land use and landscape patterns and develop the relationships between water quality and the catchment hydro-geological and environmental variables. Data from 10 monitoring sites in Trondheim formulated the basis of the case study. Thermotolerant Coliform Bacteria (TCB) and Total Phosphorus (TP) were applied as main indicators to represent the water quality in the recipient rivers, streams and in Trondheim Fjord. Based on the GIS-oriented spatial analysis, 15 hydro-geographical and landscape parameters were selected as explanatory variables. Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) models were developed at catchment and river reach scales to study correlations between the explanatory variables and the response variables, TCB and TP, in rain and snow seasons. The study showed that the spatial landscape patterns resulted in differences in the concentrations of TCB and TP in the recipients. The agricultural land was shown to be the main pollution source, leading to a higher concentration of TP in streams. Buildings, roads, and other impervious areas have induced an increase in both TCB and TP. In contrast, the forest areas, lakes, river density and steep river slopes were shown to have capacity to filter incoming P-rich runoff, thus prevent pollutant conveyance and accumulation in recipients.					; lu, jm/JPK-3675-2023	Lu, Jinmei/0000-0002-3236-2968; 													1606-9749	1607-0798				MAY	2022	22	5					5558	5574		10.2166/ws.2022.181	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/ws.2022.181		APR 2022											WOS:000788689400001
J	McGurk, MD				McGurk, MD			Comparison of fecundity-length-latitude relationships between nonanadromous (kokanee) and anadromous sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE												This study compared fecundity-length-latitude relationships between 25 kokanee populations (15 natural and 10 introduced) and 48 sockeye salmon populations. Significant differences confirmed the hypothesis that the two Oncorhynchus nerka variants follow different reproductive strategies: (i) fecundity is more highly correlated with length for kokanee than for sockeye salmon; (ii) kokanee have higher fecundity-length regression slopes and lower intercepts than sockeye salmon; (iii) kokanee populations share a common fecundity-length regression slope, but sockeye salmon populations do not; and (iv) average lengths and fecundities of kokanee decrease with increasing latitude, but those of sockeye salmon do not. The first three findings confirm that kokanee maintain a constant egg size while increasing egg number with increasing body size but that sockeye salmon increase both egg number and egg size with increasing body size. Kokanee egg sizes may be less variable than those of sockeye salmon because kokanee have lower and less variable energetic costs of spawning migration and tend to use spawning gravel with smaller and less variable particle sizes. Latitudinal clines in kokanee length and fecundity may reflect latitudinal gradients in temperature and duration of the growing season. Such environmental gradients may explain why kokanee populations are rarely found as far north as Alaska.																			0008-4301					OCT	2000	78	10					1791	1805		10.1139/cjz-78-10-1791	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-78-10-1791													WOS:000089523900013
J	Carrias, JF; Amblard, C; Bourdier, G				Carrias, JF; Amblard, C; Bourdier, G			Protistan bacterivory in an oligomesotrophic lake: Importance of attached ciliates and flagellates	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Seasonal and depth variations of the abundance, biomass, and bacterivory of protozoa (heterotrophic and mixotrophic flagellates and ciliates) were determined during thermal stratification in an oligomesotrophic lake (Lake Pavin, France). Maximal densities of heterotrophic flagellates (1.9 x 10(3) cells ml(-1)) and ciliates (6.1 cells ml(-1)) were found in the metalimnion. Pigmented flagellates dominated the flagellate biomass in the euphotic zone. Community composition of ciliated protists varied greatly with depth, and both the abundance and biomass of ciliates was dominated by oligotrichs. Heterotrophic flagellates dominated grazing, accounting for 84% of total protistan bacterivory. Maximal grazing impact of heterotrophic flagellates was 18.9 x 10(6) bacteria 1(-1) h(-1). On average, 62% of nonpigmented flagellates were found to ingest particles. Ciliates and mixotrophic flagellates averaged 13% and 3% of protistan bacterivory, respectively. Attached protozoa (ciliates and flagellates) were found to colonize the diatom Asterionella formosa. Attached bacterivores had higher ingestion rates than free bacterivorous protozoa and may account for 65% of total protozoa bacterivory. Our results indicated that even in low numbers, epibiotic protozoa may have a major grazing impact on free bacteria.

J	Merrill, AG; Benning, TL				Merrill, AG; Benning, TL			Ecosystem type differences in nitrogen process rates and controls in the riparian zone of a montane landscape	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Nitrogen (N) inputs to the world's aquatic ecosystems have increased over the past 100 years. Riparian zones and other wetlands are known to remove N from ground and surface waters before they enter lakes and streams. However, the effect of riparian wetlands on water quality has been shown to differ dramatically among sites. Sources of landscape variation in riparian N dynamics have been poorly documented and rarely quantified. Within the Lake Tahoe Basin (LTB), we hypothesized that differences in riparian N dynamics correlate to differences in ecosystem type. To test this hypothesis, we randomly selected 20 plots, four each of five ecosystem types, along a tributary to Lake Tahoe. Throughout the snow-free season, we measured soil N transformations and groundwater chemistry in each plot. We found significant differences in denitrification potential, net mineralization, net nitrification and groundwater nutrient flux among different ecosystem types. These results suggest that classification of riparian zones into ecosystem types might be useful in predicting landscape differences in riparian water quality effects. We also tested for factors expected to directly and indirectly control riparian N process rates using data collected at each study site. Using correlation and multiple regression analysis, we found that N process rates were most highly correlated with different control factors according to ecosystem type. Differences in direct and indirect control factors among ecosystem types indicate that construction of mechanistic, landscape models of riparian processes might be most accurately done by stratifying the riparian zone into ecosystem types rather than by viewing it as a single, homogeneous part of the watershed.

J	Echevarría, G; González, N				Echevarria, Gabriela; Gonzalez, Nirson			Fish trait diversity in littorals of two floodplain lakes of the highly biodiverse Caura River, Venezuela	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												We studied the trait diversity and structure in the fish communities of two floodplain lakes of the Caura River: Aricagua and Paramuto, during one hydrological cycle. We calculated taxonomic and a functional alpha and beta diversities and made comparisons among hydrological seasons and among habitats within each lake based on rarefactions. The trait structure was explored with an RLQ (analysis of a table R of environmental conditions, a table L of abundances of species and a table Q of species traits) analysis, and pairwise relationships between environmental variables and traits were explored with fourth-corner analyses. Despite its smaller extension, Paramuto showed higher alpha taxonomic and trait diversities. The substrates of open sand and those covered by leaf litter were the most diverse habitats in terms of both species and traits. The trait structure of the fish communities was influenced by the hydrological seasons, the lakes as well as water pH and temperature, and in a lesser degree dissolved oxygen, habitat type and total dissolved solids in the water. These factors constitute the habitat templet for the fish community's composition and trait structure.

J	El-Shazli, A; Hörmann, G; Wagner, PD; Fohrer, N				El-Shazli, Ahmed; Hoermann, Georg; Wagner, Paul D.; Fohrer, Nicola			Comparison of water balance method and alternative evaporation methods applied to the Aswan High Dam Reservoir	ERDE												Aswan High Dam Reservoir (AHDR) is a large human-made reservoir situated in southern Egypt and northern Sudan. The reservoir is located in a typical arid zone so that evaporation results in a significant water loss from the reservoir. To quantify these evaporation water losses, different methods can be applied. The water balance method was used to estimate water losses of the AHDR during 43 open-water seasons. Compared to earlier publications, this study used longer time series data and more evaporation approaches. Moreover, we evaluated the deviation between evaporation rates as derived from the water balance method and as calculated using 16 evaporation/evapotranspiration formulas. Five approaches are not well suited for use at the AHDR because they underestimated evaporation rates (e.g. Stephens-Stewart model), or overestimated evaporation rates (e.g. de Bruin model). Annual evaporation rates obtained by the Bowen ratio energy balance method at the three floating stations Raft, Allaqi and Abu Simbel were estimated at 7.9, 6.9 and 6.7 mm d(-1), respectively. The monthly water losses of the years 1978 to 1984, a period with reasonable evaporation rates, are used to estimate the evaporation losses. The results of the study show a systematic deviation between the monthly average values determined using the water balance method through the period 1978 to 1984 and the monthly mean values determined by the 16 evaporation calculation approaches at three floating stations. This deviation is particularly clear in the months of May, June and September (primarily lower estimates) as well as in July (primarily higher estimates). The deviation can be attributed to the simplicity of the water balance method as well as to its limited suitability for large reservoirs as the AHDR over short periods like a month. Among the 16 evaporation calculation approaches the mass transfer method provided the most reasonable results under the given site conditions.					; Fohrer, Dr., Nicola/C-6313-2011; Fohrer, Dr., Nicola Fohrer/C-6313-2011	Hormann, Georg/0000-0002-3141-9264; Wagner, Paul/0000-0002-1594-398X; Fohrer, Dr., Nicola/0000-0002-7456-6301; 													0013-9998						2018	149	2-3			SI		117	131		10.12854/erde-2018-349	http://dx.doi.org/10.12854/erde-2018-349													WOS:000445800700006

Through biweekly census, from April to November 2015, seasonal variation in leaf age structure of the Eelgrass Zostera marina L. was studied in Swan Lake of Shandong Peninsula, China by examining density, dimensions and biomass of shoots relative to leaf ages. In addition, we examined if variability in leaf age structure was related to water temperature and/or underwater irradiance. The leaf density, number of leaves per shoot, leaf area index, total leaf area per shoot and leaf biomass of young and old Z. marina leaves were far less than those of the mature leaves with percentages of >50% in all leaf ages. The leaf age structure of mature Z. marina leaves exhibited a clear seasonal variation with significant peaks in early July, which corresponded with the seasonal changes in shoot density and biomass of Z. marina. The results demonstrated that mature leaves would be a leading component in leaf age structure of Z. marina. Curve Estimation revealed that the seasonal variation in leaf age structure of Eelgrass was closely positively related to water temperature. The results provided data that could prove helpful in quantitative studies of leaf-age dependent aspects of Seagrass ecology.

They play a key role since they are a link in the interaction network with members of other communities. Temporal changes in the community structure of the Rotifera assemblage is related to hydrologic phases. Goals: In this study, we focus on testing the hypothesis that the seasonal changes in alpha diversity and abundance (standing stocks) of Rotifera (Monogononta), considering also limnological variables, are mainly related to rainfall patterns. We consider four seasons based on rainfall: rainy, very rainy, dry, and very dry. Methods: Between 2008 and 2009, rotifers were sampled monthly with a plankton net in qualitative and quantitative sampling, and seven limnological variables were recorded at three sampling stations along Lake Amapa. Results: We found approximately 23% of all Rotifera listed for the Amazonia. The high Menhinick index revealed a high species dominance, except in the rainy season. The Shannon index did riot show a greater distribution of organisms (0.3844 to 0.8886) independent of the layer and time season. In general, the equability index showed that all species were equally abundant in all seasons, with higher values at the surface and in the middle of the water column. The limnological variables also showed differences between all seasons in at least a layer of the water column. Conclusions: The seasons influenced the fluctuations in the communities of Rotifera of Lake Amapa, which led to a different species distribution pattern over time.

One of the most important threats comes from the biotic environment including interactions at the trophic level. An unidentified issue was the occurrence and importance of phytophagous insects inhabiting S. lapponum in terms of real threats to growth and development as well as specific plant reactions to herbivores. The aim of the study was to recognize the occurrence of phytophagous insects inhabiting S. lapponum, i.e. an endangered species, and estimation of physiological changes caused by the herbivorous species feeding. The field study was conducted in a locality of S. lapponum population in the peat bog near Bikcze Lake (Polesie Lubelskie Region) in 2014-2015. In each growing season from the end of April to September, 100 stems of S. lapponum shoots with similar length were examined once a month. Selected parameters of chlorophyll a fluorescence were measured and the accumulation of H2O2 was visually detected in leaves collected from the control plants and from those attacked by herbivores using the 3',3-diaminobenzidine (DAB) method. We found the presence of 8 phytophagous insect species from 4 orders (Coleoptera, Diptera, Hemiptera and Lepidoptera) on S. lapponum. Most of the shoots were inhabited by Lochmea caprea, Aphrophora salicina and Aphis farinosa. On the basis of the measurements of chlorophyll a fluorescence and H2O2 accumulation under phytophagous insects feeding, we have demonstrated that S. lapponum was able to maintain photosynthesis under insect attack and that the accumulation of H2O2 in leaf blades indicates local rather than systemic stress response to herbivore feeding. Phytophagous insects feeding caused relatively weak disruptions to host plant physiology and S. lapponum is able to maintain photosynthetic efficiency under insect attack. Variation in plant traits influence host plant selection and performance of herbivorous insects. Comparative studies are needed to assess the species composition and population numbers of insects occurring on plants from other S. lapponum populations. Detailed knowledge of the biotic factors affecting the occurrence of S. lapponum would facilitate establishment of the form of its conservation.					; Hawrylak-Nowak, Barbara/P-1129-2018; Kmiec, Katarzyna/JHU-3765-2023	Pogorzelec, Magdalena/0000-0003-2584-2186; Banach-Albinska, Barbara/0000-0002-9434-2540; Hawrylak-Nowak, Barbara/0000-0002-2935-1491; Kmiec, Katarzyna/0000-0003-2272-4512													1641-1307	2083-8387					2018	79						131	139		10.12657/denbio.079.012	http://dx.doi.org/10.12657/denbio.079.012													WOS:000435409900012

The climatological and environmental variability in East Africa increases this complexity. Long rainfall isotope datasets are needed to fill the lack of observations in this region. At Kisiba Masoko, Tanzania, rainfall and rain isotopic composition have been monitored during 6 years. Mean year profiles allow to analyse the seasonal variations. The mean annual rainfall is 2099mm with a rain-weighted mean composition of -3.2 parts per thousand for delta O-18 and -11.7 parts per thousand for delta H-2. The results are consistent with available data although they present their own specificity. Thus, if the local meteoric water line is delta H-2=8.6 delta O-18+14.8, two seasonal lines are observed. The seasonality of the isotopic composition in rain and deuterium excess has been compared with precipitating air masses backtracking trajectories to characterize a simple scheme of vapour histories. The three major oceanic sources have two moisture signatures with their own trajectory histories: one originated from the tropical Indian Ocean at the beginning of the rainy season and one from the Austral Ocean at its end. The presented isotopic seasonality depends on the balance of the intertropical front and provides a useful dataset to improve the knowledge about local processes.

Size distribution of larvae entrained and the role of fine mesh screening in excluding larvae at an operating power plant	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Patrick PH, Powell J, Mason E, Tai M-K, Stanko T, Dziedzic HD. 2018. Size distribution of larvae entrained and the role of fine mesh screening in excluding larvae at an operating power plant. Lake Reserv Manage. 00:00-00.This study clearly demonstrated the importance of measuring larval length and head capsule dimension in assessing larval fish entrainment and in determining the performance of screen mesh openings in excluding larvae. We determined the size distribution of fish larvae entrained at the Campbell Power Plant on Lake Michigan and assessed the potential of 4 screen mesh sizes (range, 1.59-9.53mm [1/16-3/8 in] plus an open-pipe control) in reducing the number and size of entrained larvae. Fish larvae were collected using an entrainment pump net-in-water design. Different sizes of larvae, based on both total length and head capsule size, were entrained at the Campbell Plant, and size ranges varied with species. Entrainment densities also varied with season and diurnally. The screens tested in our study were not effective in excluding larval fish. There was no statistical difference (P > 0.05) in the number of larvae entrained among the different screen sizes tested. Most organisms entrained during screen mesh testing were small (<10mm total length) and had head capsule sizes (1.0mm) smaller than the smallest screen mesh size tested.

A total of 157 diatom taxa have been reported in phytoplankton, epilithon and epipelon. Cymbella affinis, Epithemia turgida and Gomphonema olivaceum were the most common taxa on the basis of relative frequency both in phytoplankton and benthic algal associations. Hierarchical cluster analysis clearly grouped the taxa into two major clusters, discriminating common and dominant species than rare and scarce taxa. Principal component analysis, revealing the spatial and temporal variation of dominant and subdominant taxa, suggested seasonality of diatoms in different habitats of the lake. Most of the diatoms recorded in Lake Hazar that are typical alkalibiontic and oligotraphent species occurred rarely or scarcely in phytoplankton and periphyton. On the other hand, reaching to high abundances of meso-eutraphent species indicated a response to increased nutrients in the lake.

J	Ulrich, S; Röske, K				Ulrich, Sabine; Roeske, Kerstin			Autumnella lusatica gen. nov. and sp. nov. (Chlorophyta, Trebouxiophyceae), a new phytoplankton species in acidic lignite pit lakes	PHYCOLOGIA												We describe a novel green algal species that has been recorded for a decade but not specified during phytoplankton monitoring of acidic pit lakes in Saxony, Germany. Based on sequences of 18S rDNA, the ITS1-5.8S rDNA-ITS2 region and 16S rDNA, the novel alga is described as Autumnella lusatica gen. nov. & sp. nov. within the class Trebouxiophyceae. A close phylogenetic relationship led to the assignment of the morphologically similar Koliella corcontica Hindak to the new genus. Autumnella lusatica grows well in a neutral culture medium for green algae. In the type locality, the new species is characterized by (1) tolerance against acidity down to pH 3.0; (2) ability to propagate and establish enormous biovolumes at conditions of acidic pH, low total phosphorus (TP) and total inorganic carbon (TIC) concentrations; and (3) unusual seasonal growth dynamics with maximum and minimum biovolumes in October and June, respectively. As in other lakes, A. lusatica was abundant in the oligotrophic lake, Haberdorfer See, and caused chlorophyll a concentrations up to 30 mu g l(-1) at pH values between 3.0 and 3.5, TIC concentrations of usually < 1 mg l(-1) and TP of < 10 mu g l(-1) in the euphotic zone. During its main growth phase, A. lusatica increased the total carbon in the euphotic zone on average by 2 mg l(-1) or a factor of eight by C accumulation. Its growth rate could be even greater than that of some typical mixotrophic competitors. During lake stratification, the species preferred the epilimnion, supported by the formation of oil droplets in the cytoplasm.																			0031-8884						2018	57	3					251	261		10.2216/17-46.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.2216/17-46.1													WOS:000435440300002

Contribution of Koayu, calculated using delta N-15 values of spawned Ayu eggs, was much greater than that of Ooayu in general, as previously reported. Ooayu spawned more eggs in the upper area of the spawning ground and did so late in the season.

J	Sinha, NK				Sinha, Nirmal K.			Borehole indentor - A tool for assessing in-situ bulk ice strength and micromechanics	COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												National Research Council (NRC) borehole indentor (BHI) is increasingly being used in the Arctic for measuring in-situ bulk strength of ice and its seasonal variation in conjunctions with investigations on climate change. Before NRC-BHI system was taken to the Arctic, its performance was evaluated on columnar-grained Si ice in Dow's Lake, Ottawa. Si ice with its huge and clear grains is ideal for microstructural analysis of indented ice and understanding the micromechanisms of failures (ductile and brittle) under three-dimensionally confined BHI conditions involving large volumes of ice. The upper yield (UY) strength was shown to exhibit power-law dependence on average stress rate to UY. This power-law is universally applicable to low-salinity (0.3 ppt) brackish-water S2 ice and various types of sea ice - first-year S3, granular and frazil, second-year S3 and multi-year ridge ice. The concept of shift function is introduced for quantifying the effect of temperature on BHI-UY strength. For 0.62 m thick Si ice sheet at an average temperature of -3.8 degrees C (or 0.986 T(m)) the failure indentation is constant for strength of 15 to 30 MPa or stress of 1.5 x 10(-3) E to 3.0 x 10(-3) E - analogous to high-temperature creep failure strains under comparable normalized stresses in metal and complex alloys - thus establishing the same physics of deformation and failure processes. For BHI tests, the preferred independent and controllable variable, however, is the indentation rate. Both BHI-UY and BHI-flow strength (for 5 mm penetration, say) also obey power-law dependence on indentation rate and 0.1 mm s(-1) is suggested for standardization. While UY failures are characterized by parabolic zone of deformed, recrystallized and HIPed (hot isostatically pressed) ice, premature brittle fractures occurring at speeds at or higher than 0.2 mm s(-1), are caused by the propagation of cracks nucleated at the ice-indentor contact surface. Two different measures of the degree of maturity in brittle fractures are proposed - one based on failure time and the other on UY stress. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TMDLs are based on a BAF (bioaccumulation factor), which is the ratio of methyl mercury in fish to dissolved methyl mercury in water. Analysis of fish tissue and aqueous methyl mercury samples collected at a number of locations and over several seasons in a 118-km reach of the Savannah River demonstrated that species-specific BAFs varied by factors of three to eight. Factors contributing to BAF variability were location, habitat, and season-related differences in fish muscle tissue mercury levels and seasonal differences in dissolved methyl mercury levels. Overall (all locations, habitats, and seasons) average BAFs were 3.7 X 10(6) for largemouth bass, 1.4 X 10(6) for sunfishes, and 2.5 X 10(6) for white catfish. Determination of representative BAFs for mercury in fish from large rivers necessitates collecting large and approximately equal numbers of fish and aqueous methyl mercury samples over a seasonal cycle from the entire area and all habitats to be represented by the TMDL.																			0090-4341					FEB	2004	46	2					236	243		10.1007/s00244-003-2305-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00244-003-2305-5								15106676					WOS:000188848000013

During 1996-2002, atrazine concentrations in the atmospheric gas and particle phases were investigated at three Canadian Integrated Atmospheric Deposition Network (IADN) sites including two lakeside sites (Burnt Island and Point Petrel and a rural inland site (Egbert). Strong seasonality with peak concentrations occurring in late April-early July was observed. An atrazine usage map for Canada (sum: 870t) and the United States (sum: 34 500 t) in 2002 was created. Local application and regional atmospheric transport both appear to contribute to its atmospheric occurrence, while the latter might episodically result in high concentrations events. No strong temperature dependence was observed for atrazine particle-gas partitioning. Recent measurement results of atrazine in precipitation samples collected at Egbert and another agricultural site, Vineland, through the Canadian Atmospheric Network for Currently Used Pesticides (CANCUP), are also presented. Dry, wet, and gas exchange deposition all contribute to atmospheric inputs of atrazine to the Great Lakes. For Lake Ontario, gas exchange is estimated to be of similar magnitude to dry and wet deposition.					; Yao, Yuan/A-9150-2017; LI, YI-FAN/U-7024-2019	/0000-0001-5731-4455; 													0013-936X	1520-5851				NOV 15	2007	41	22					7639	7644		10.1021/es0701715	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es0701715								18075068					WOS:000250974700011
J	Folk, TH; Hepp, GR				Folk, TH; Hepp, GR			Effects of habitat use and movement patterns on incubation behavior of female wood ducks (Aix sponsa) in southeast Alabama	AUK												We examined effects of movement patterns and habitat use of female Wood Ducks (Aix sponsa) during incubation on incubation constancy and recess frequency. Incubating females (n = 41) were equipped with subcutaneous radiotransmitters and subsequently located during daily recess events. Using compositional analysis, we determined beaver ponds, creeks, ephemeral wetlands, and lake-influenced habitats ranked higher in preference than other available aquatic habitats (i.e. managed impoundments, farm pond, and lake habitats). An inverse relationship between female use of the top four ranked habitats and recess range size suggested that those were high-quality habitats. Mean (+/-SE) incubation constancy (n = 40 nests) was 81.3 +/- 0.8%, and females took an average of 2.2 +/- 0.3 recesses day(-1). Incubation period averaged 31.8 +/- 0.3 days, and there was a weak inverse relationship between incubation period and incubation constancy. Incubating females lost 3.9 +/- 0.8% of early incubation body mass, but body-mass changes were not associated with use of preferred habitats (i.e. beaver ponds, creeks, ephemeral wetlands, and lake-influenced areas). Initiation date of incubation and percentage use of preferred habitats were the most important variables describing variation in incubation constancy. Constancy declined later in the breeding season and with increased use of preferred habitats. Recess frequency decreased with increasing variation in distances that females traveled from the nest. Wood Ducks nesting at southern latitudes generally are not energetically constrained during incubation, and nest attentiveness is only weakly associated with incubation period. We would expect stronger relationships between habitat use, body-mass dynamics, and incubation behavior under environmental conditions that are more severe or less predictable.

J	Douglas, GB; Adeney, JA				Douglas, GB; Adeney, JA			Diagenetic cycling of trace elements in the bottom sediments of the Swan River Estuary, Western Australia	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												Teflon strips were used in-situ in the bottom sediments at two sites in the Swan River Estuary to collect diagenetic Fe-Mn oxyhydroxides and monitor monthly changes in their morphology and trace element geochemistry. This study demonstrates that substantial concentrations of trace elements accumulate at the redox front during the formation of diagenetic Fe-Mn oxyhydroxides. It is likely that the Fe-Mn oxyhydroxides initially nucleate and grow on the Teflon strips via bacterial activity. Trace element geochemistry of the diagenetic Fe-Mn oxyhydroxides is influenced by changes in the supply of trace elements from either the bottom sediments and/or water column or changes in the physico-chemical status of bottom and porewaters. If sufficient diagenetic Fe-Mn oxyhydroxides are preserved in the upper layer(s) of the bottom sediment it is possible that diagenetic (secondary) trace element enrichment profiles may be produced which modify the historical input of natural or anthropogenic trace element sources. Alternatively, partial or complete dissolution of the diagenetic Fe-Mn oxyhydroxides in response to temporal changes in the redox status of the bottom sediment may lead to a substantial underestimate of trace element fluxes in historical bottom sediment profiles. This study highlights that considerable care must be taken when interpreting short- to long-term geochemical profiles in bottom sediments due to the possible occurrence of rapid, seasonally mediated diagenetic processes.

We used long term data (1880-1997) on Bythotrephes longimanus in Eurasian waterbodies to characterize its ecology and tolerance re different ecological factors. Depending on season and environmental conditions of the waterbody, Eurasian B. longimanus:rs may undergo cyclomorphosis and can exist as two distinct forms (B. longimanus or B. cederstroemi). Regional forms of the species (B. l. var. balticus, B. l. var. transcaucasicus, and B. l. var. arcticus) have also been described. Occurrence and density of Bythotrephes populations varies across geographical scales, and are apparently affected primarily by water temperature and salinity. Bythotrephes is limited to regions where water temperature ranges between 4 and 30 degrees C, although the species prefers waters between 10 and 24 degrees C. Bythotrephes tolerates salinity values between 0.04 and 8.0 parts per thousand, though it prefers water between 0.04 and 0.4 parts per thousand. These factors strongly restrict Bythotrephes' distribution in warmer and more saline waters of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), particularly in southern Russia and Kazakhstan. Local abundance and distribution of Bythotrephes is affected by abiotic factors, including basin morphometry and Bushing rate, temperature, oxygen concentration and pH, as well as by lake trophic status and fish predation. Planktivorous fish may restrict habitat use by Bythotrephes to regions of basins where overlap between these groups is minimized. Rivers, canals, and ephemeral waterbodies serve as important modes of Bythotrephes' dispersal throughout the CIS and western Europe. Morphological adaptations (e.g. a long caudal process, cyclic parthenogenesis, and production of resting eggs) permit Byhotrephes to tolerate seasonally inhospitable conditions, assist in its dispersal and range extension, and minimize fish predation.

J	Hall, CJ; Burns, CW				Hall, CJ; Burns, CW			Responses of crustacean zooplankton to seasonal and tidal salinity changes in the coastal Lake Waihola, New Zealand	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Lake Waihola is a shallow, tidal, coastal lake that receives brackish inflows resulting in salinities of up to 4.8parts per thousand. We determined the importance of salinity and tidal currents on crustacean zooplankton abundance and distribution in this lake over 2 years. Tidal currents were traced using drogues, and zooplankton was sampled over tidal cycles. Tidal currents reached velocities of 35 cm s(-1) closest to the tidal inlet channel. Salinity explained 26% of the variation in the abundance and species composition of the zooplankton assemblage, and accounted for >60% of the species-environment correlation. Increases in salinity resulted in a change in crustacean dominance from the freshwater calanoid copepod, Boeckella hamata Brehm, and cladoceran, Daphnia carinata King, to the estuarine copepod, Gladioferens pectinatus Brady. The abundance of D. carinata was negatively correlated with chlorophyll a concentrations, although chlorophyll a was not correlated with salinity. Future increases in salinity and tidal currents may cause significant changes in the zooplankton community structure.																			0028-8330					MAR	2003	37	1					31	43		10.1080/00288330.2003.9517144	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.2003.9517144													WOS:000183237600004

Proglacial lakes can affect glacier dynamics, catchment hydrology and have the potential to cause glacial lake outburst floods. Therefore, monitoring the onset and development of proglacial lake formation is relevant to understand glacial processes and anticipate glacier response to climate change. In this study, we integrate geomorphological and ice-dynamic information to assess proglacial lake development in Exploradores Glacier, Chilean Patagonia. We monitor recent spatial and temporal changes in the lower trunk of Exploradores Glacier (10 km(2)) to provide a 20-year observation record by combining eight uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAV) surveys between 2019 and 2020, with high-medium resolution satellite imagery (Rapid Eye and Landsat) between 2000 and 2018. We use feature tracking techniques, digital surface elevation model analysis and field data to create a multi-temporal scale (inter-annual and seasonal) and a multi-spatial (cm to km) data set. Our analysis shows that surface velocity overall trend has not changed over the last 20 years and that surface velocity near the terminus is significant (>10 m a(-1)). Moreover, an exceptional advance over moraine deposits was detected. We also found low downwasting rates (<0.5 m a(-1)) close to the glacier terminus which are attributed to sufficient ice flux and the insulation effect of the debris-covered surface. However, hundreds of supraglacial ponds were observed and are currently coalescing and expanding by ice-cliff backwasting favoring glacier disintegration. Lastly, it was found that calving losses at the east marginal lake equaled ice-flux input into the lake for the UAV monitored period. This study contributes to a better understanding of glacial lake dynamics during proglacial lake development, and our results may help ice modelling efforts to predict glacier response to future climate scenarios.

Macrofungi were surveyed on these plots at weekly intervals during the fruiting season over 3 years. During this survey 177 species were recorded, including 30 species inhabiting leaf litter, 36 ectomycorrhizal species, 29 non-mycorrhizal soil-inhabiting species, and 79 wood-inhabiting species. This species richness is comparable to, but slightly higher than, that reported by other plot-based studies undertaken in hardwood forests. We compared the ability of seven species-richness estimation techniques to determine the true species richness on these plots. While some estimators performed better than others, in general the estimations were too low based on the following year's data and were not consistent from year to year. We found some evidence of spatial autocorrelation of communities of fungi found in adjacent subplots. This indicates that the benefit of using contiguous subplots to increase the homogeneity of the area sampled needs to be balanced against the possibility of underestimating the species richness of an area because of spatial autocorrelation.					; Murphy, Jack/R-3847-2019	Schmit, John Paul/0000-0003-3781-2750; 													0008-4026					JUL	1999	77	7					1014	1027		10.1139/b99-055	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b99-055													WOS:000084044700011
J	Lucas, CH				Lucas, CH			Population dynamics of Aurelia aurita (Scyphozoa) from an isolated brackish lake, with particular reference to sexual reproduction	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The annual cycle of abundance. growth and sexual reproduction of the scyphomedusa Aurelia aurita was examined over a 12 month period in an isolated, shallow, brackish, man-made body of water: Horsea Lake, England. Strobilation started in December and ephyrae were present through June in varying numbers, suggesting a 7 month period of near-continuous recruitment. Horsea Lake has a dense A.aurita population, with the peak abundance of 24.9 m(-3) occurring in mid-May. Medusae (>10 mm) were present in the water column from March through January. Maximum bell diameter of 105 mm was observed in late September. However, medusa growth was very poor (G ranged between -0.03 and 0.07 day(-1) over a 12 month period), and monthly mean bell diameters were typically <50 mm. For most of the year, the abundant A.aurita population was most likely severely food limited as a result of a numerically and species-poor mesozooplankton community dominated by the calanoid copepods Acartia margalefi and Acartia tonsa. Nevertheless, the very small A.aurita medusae were still able to attain sexual maturity and reproduce. Ripe female medusae carrying fertilized eggs and planula larvae were first observed in May and June, although the main period of planula larva production was September-December. In November, all females were ripe, the smallest being 19-20 mm bell diameter. At both Horsea Lake and a nearby productive estuary, Southampton Water, planula larva production increased linearly with wet weight, although compared with the larger A.aurita medusae from Southampton Water. reproductive output at Horsea Lake was low. Aurelia aurita in Horsea Lake showed plasticity in its population characteristics in response to environmental conditions, with both fecundity and size to maturity varying on a seasonal basis. Medusae appeared to partition the available food resources into either somatic growth when food was abundant or reproductive effort when food was scarce.

J	Wang, ZP; Zeng, D; Patrick, WH				Wang, ZP; Zeng, D; Patrick, WH			Methane emissions from natural wetlands	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Methane is considered one of the most important greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Because of the strict anaerobic conditions required by CH4-generating microorganisms, natural wetland ecosystems are one of the main sources of biogenic CH4. The total natural wetland area is estimated to be 5.3 to 5.7 x 10(12) m(2), making up less than 5% of the Earth's land surface. However, natural wetland plays a disproportionately large role in CH4 emissions. Wetlands are likely the largest natural sources of CH4 to the atmosphere, accounting for about 20% of the current global annual emission. Out of the total amount of CH4 emitted, northern wetlands contribute 34%, temperate wetlands 5%, and tropical systems about 60%. Because of the unique characteristics and high productivity, wetland ecosystems are important in the global carbon cycle. Natural wetlands are permanently or temporarily saturated. Strict anaerobic conditions consequently develop, which allows methanogenesis to occur. But the thin oxic layer and the oxic plant rhizophere promote activity of CH4-oxidizing bacteria or methanotrophs. Thus, both CH4 formation and consumption in wetland systems are microbiological processes and are controlled by many factors. Eight of the controlling factors, including carbon supply, soil oxidation-reduction status, pH, temperature, vegetation, salinity and sulfate content, soil hydrological conditions and CH4 oxidation are discussed in this paper.																			0167-6369					SEP	1996	42	1-2					143	161		10.1007/BF00394047	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00394047								24193498					WOS:A1996VB07900010
J	Frau, D; Pineda, A; Mayora, G; Devercelli, M				Frau, Diego; Pineda, Alfonso; Mayora, Gisela; Devercelli, Melina			Phytoplankton taxonomic and functional diversity in two shallow alluvial lakes with contrasting river connectivity	AQUATIC SCIENCES												The mechanisms behind phytoplankton diversity patterns in natural ecosystems still remain elusive. In two shallow lakes with contrasting river connectivity, we first explored how diversity within each sampling (alfa diversity, alpha), among samplings (beta diversity, beta 1), and among hydrological seasons (beta 2) contributed to the diversity registered throughout the whole year (gamma diversity, gamma). Then we estimated the importance of several environmental and temporal factors as structuring factors of these diversity patterns. To do this, we sampled the two lakes-one laterally isolated and other laterally connected lake with the Parana River System-during a complete hydrological year. For the analyses, we considered both the species and the functional group level. At the species level, temporal variation (beta 1 + beta 2) made the main contribution for gamma diversity at the connected lake, possibly related to the constant species input from the river system. For the isolated lake, however, alpha was the main contributor. Regarding functional groups, alpha was the most important for both lakes, although no element of gamma diversity was different from the null model. Environmental factors like conductivity, turbidity, nutrient availability, and flood phases appeared as more relevant for the connected lake. Temporal processes (e.g., succession, ecological drift) were critical for the observed diversity patterns in both lakes. These results were consistent particularly considering the taxonomical approach. Our main findings are that the environment influences phytoplankton diversity patterns; however, other dynamics occurring on temporal scales may be more relevant for the phytoplankton community.

The channel starts in an open pit lake through one of the Concepcion Mine main galleries, located in the Iberian Pyrite Belt, about 10 km northwest of Rio Tinto mining complex (southwest Spain). This gallery intercepts one of the largest and oldest underground mining work locations called "gallery Carmen", allowing the exit of AMD affected waters. This channel is the first AMD polluting source in the Odiel basin. Thus, at the end of the rainy season, we conducted water sampling along this channel, from its source to its mouth, to further analyse its characterization and interpret the cause-effect relationships through the application of Fuzzy Logic and classical statistics tools. The interdependent relationship between the measured physicochemical parameters are set in order to propose a model, capable of describing the evolution of contaminants in response to the processes and reactions taking place within the affected channel and the Odiel river. The present work concluded the existence of natural attenuation processes for the mining channel, despite the entrances of other drainages in the AMD channel with different hydrochemical characteristics imposing modifications on it. This indicates that these media have a high vulnerability to external stimuli.

In this study, the variation characteristics of P in overlying and leaching water under the conditions of fertilizer reduction and straw application and its impact on the environment were studied through a two-season rice field experiment. Four treatments were set, including no fertilizer without straw (CK), conventional fertilization (CF), 20% reduction in nitrogen (N) and P fertilization (RF), and 20% reduction in N and P fertilization with the wheat straw (RFWS). The results showed that RF could effectively reduce the risk of P loss due to its ability to decrease the concentration of P in overlying and leaching water. RFWS increased P concentrations in overlying and leaching water of rice fields. Total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) was the main form of total phosphorus (TP), and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) was the main form of TDP. The concentration of TP, TDP, and SRP in the overlying and leaching water peaked on the first day after fertilization, and then gradually decreased. The high-risk period of P loss was 0 to 10 days after fertilization. This study could provide appropriate strategies to reduce the risk of P loss during local rice cultivation and protect local water resources from eutrophication.					; Yang, Yajun/JFJ-8563-2023	Zhou, Wei/0000-0002-9137-3085; 														2073-4441				APR	2022	14	8							1250	10.3390/w14081250	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14081250													WOS:000785203900001
J	Sánchez-Carrillo, S; Alvarez-Cobelas, M; Angeler, DG				Sánchez-Carrillo, S; Alvarez-Cobelas, M; Angeler, DG			Sedimentation in the semi-arid freshwater wetland Las Tablas de Daimiel (Spain)	WETLANDS												Despite sedimentation being recognized as a very important process in wetlands, very little is known about its dynamics. This study analyzed sedimentation on a short-term scale in the semiarid floodplain wetland Las Tablas de Daimiel National Park (central Spain). In monthly sampling intervals during 1997 and 1998, we measured seasonal and spatial sedimentation patterns of total solids, organic and mineral matter, nitrogen, and phosphorus using sediment traps. The highest mean mass accumulation rates were obtained at the wetland-input site (135 +/- 57 g m(-2) d(-1)), but a decrease in sedimentation rates was noted with increasing distance from the inflow (49 +/- 39 g m(-2) d(-1) in the terminal zone of the wetland). Flow and water level explained only 13% of variance in sedimentation, The sedimentation patterns presented clear seasonality, coinciding with the period of vegetation growth. There existed a marked spatial heterogeneity in sedimentation that can be attributed to differences in vegetative cover. In vegetated areas, sedimentation of solids was related with nutrient deposition coming from detritus. Sedimentation of mineral matter dominated over the organic fraction. Autochthonous material comprised a very important fraction of accumulated sediment (between 31-57% of mineral matter and 45-65% of organic matter). Sedimentation of autochthonous total phosphorus made up about 90% of total settling phosphorus. Reed (Phragmites australis) and sawgrass (Cladium mariscus) plant cover significantly explained sedimentation of organic matter in the wetland (R-2 = 0.78 and 0.57, respectively). The contribution of phytoplankton primary productivity to total organic carbon sedimentation was negligible and observed only at the deeper sampling stations. The autochthonous mineral matter of the settling seston may originate either from primary precipitation of endogenic calcite and/or rapid mineralization of organic matter on the sediment surface. Accretion rates were very high (1.61-3.87 cm yr(-1)), suggesting that the wetland will silt up within the next century if present rates are maintained. Thus, sedimentation dynamics must be involved in management strategies in order to conserve important wetlands.					; Sanchez-Carrillo, Salvador/L-1098-2014	Angeler, David/0000-0003-2197-7470; 													0277-5212	1943-6246				MAR	2001	21	1					112	124		10.1672/0277-5212(2001)021[0112:SITSAF]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1672/0277-5212(2001)021[0112:SITSAF]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000167840100010

Temporal coherence of water quality variables in a suite of Missouri reservoirs	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												A six-year time series of water quality data from four eutrophic prairie reservoirs located in adjacent watersheds in northwest Missouri were analyzed for seasonal patterns and temporal coherence of temperature, dissolved oxygen, transparency, major ions, nutrients, suspended solids and chlorophyll. Water temperature was strongly seasonal as determined by the square of the average correlation of monthly means among years. No other variable was consistently seasonal in all four reservoirs, although two reservoirs exhibited strong seasonality for total and dissolved nitrogen and nitrate. Percent temporal coherence, measured as the square of the correlation between paired reservoir data sets, ranged from >= 98% for water temperature to <15% for chlorophyll. Ionic constituents (especially magnesium and alkalinity) and phosphorus fractions (dissolved, total and soluble reactive) had the strongest coherence (43-66%) averaged across all reservoir pairs. Algal biomass as chlorophyll and volatile solids had the weakest temporal coherence (0-21%). Other variables showed intermediate coherence (>= 35%) for one or more reservoir pairs. Coherence strength between reservoirs was related to juxtaposition of catchments and probably reflects catchment-specific features. Temporal synchrony among these reservoirs may reflect a greater influence of external conditions on nutrients than transparency or algal biomass.

Controlled experiments compared the impact of goldfish in both mud- and gravel-bottomed outdoor pools, with either caged or non-caged vegetation. High levels of turbidity were generated by foraging goldfish in mud pools (P < 0.01). All non-caged submersed plants (Potamogeton) showed extensive grazing damage and all of the unprotected submersed and emergent forms were uprooted. Data from Stoneycroft pond where a feral goldfish population reached 15-17 000 individuals ha(-1), confirmed the experimental findings showing goldfish to be benthic herbivores, causing a visible increase in turbidity and decrease in aquatic vegetation. Gut analysis revealed goldfish to have little diet overlap with native amphibians. High turbidity should reduce the success of predators feeding on goldfish, and may decrease the foraging success of other competitors. The sporadic distribution of goldfish in Canada may be linked to site characteristics, specifically the susceptibility of the area to turbidity generation.

An Environmental DNA Assessment of Fish Assemblages on Artificial Reefs in the Northern Gulf of Mexico	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Globally, estuarine and marine fisheries have declined over the past century, and a variety of approaches have been employed in an attempt to improve fisheries, including the development of protected areas, implementation of catch regulations, hatchery stocking, and habitat augmentation. The focus of this study was to assess the impact of the introduction of artificial reefs on the fish assemblages in the northern Gulf of Mexico (nGOM). Unfortunately, assessing the success of artificial reefs has been problematic due to the high turbidity of the region and the difficulty of using traditional sampling gears to assess species diversity at reefs. To accomplish this, we gathered environmental DNA metabarcode data (12S) to assess the impact of reef age (1-19 years), construction material (limestone, concrete, shell, and oil and gas), and season on the fish assemblages at nine artificial reefs in the nGOM. The results indicate higher species richness at reefs versus paired control sites as well as differences between seasons, reef materials, and reef positions. Our results suggest that this technique is a viable method of monitoring ray-finned fish species on artificial reefs and can provide baseline information on the fish assemblages associated with artificial reefs in the nGOM.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				MAY	2022	151	3					297	321		10.1002/tafs.10352	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tafs.10352		MAR 2022											WOS:000772990100001
J	Gelda, RK; Effler, SW				Gelda, RK; Effler, SW			Estimating oxygen exchange across the air-water interface of a hypereutrophic lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Patterns of estimates of oxygen flux (J) across the air-water interface of hypereutrophic Onondaga Lake, NY, U. S. A., are characterized for time scales ranging from diel to seasonal for an 8-month period. The analysis is supported by a high frequency (most often hourly) monitoring program, conducted with a robotic buoy, that included measurements of dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, and fluorometric chlorophyll a in the lake's surface waters, vertical profiles of DO through the epilimnion, and wind speed and solar radiance. The magnitude and direction of J is demonstrated to vary dramatically at diel, day-to-day, and seasonal time scales. Thus, large errors in estimates of J may result from extrapolating flux calculations made from short-term data to longer time periods. The variations in J were driven by variations in metabolic activity and meteorology, and were mediated by departures from equilibrium DO concentrations and wind-driven turbulence. Extended periods of high J values are shown to coincide with intervals of large departures from equilibrium DO concentrations, but day-to-day differences are driven mostly by variations in wind. A distinct diel pattern of J estimates is manifested for average conditions, with substantially higher J values during daylight hours. This pattern reflects the common diel patterns of the drivers of both higher DO oversaturation and wind speed over those hours. It is demonstrated that the magnitude of J is substantial relative to net changes in the epilimnetic DO pool, and thus must be accommodated accurately in estimates of primary production and community respiration that are to be based on diel monitoring of DO in the water columns of productive lakes.

Our goal was to determine the overlap of habitats selected, based on profiles of temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO). We used hydroacoustics to ascertain the seasonal habitat selection of rainbow smelt and gill nets to sample Atlantic salmon in the Inland Sea of Lake Champlain, Vermont. We identified patterns of smelt habitat selection by overlaying the acoustically determined vertical distributions of smelt onto profiles of water temperature and DO. To verify species composition of acoustical targets, we performed midwater trawls using a stepped-oblique method and found that rainbow smelt constituted 99.5% of trawl catches. Trawl catches and acoustic fish density were correlated, indicating that acoustic targets represented trawled fish. Atlantic salmon habitat selection was estimated from temperature and DO profiles taken at gill nets that caught salmon. Data for Atlantic salmon and rainbow smelt demonstrated extensive spatial overlap in habitat selection during the three sampling seasons. Our results provide greater insight into the predator-prey interactions of these species as mediated by environmental factors. Because Atlantic salmon are stocked, this insight into the predator-prey interactions may assist managers in effectively regulating stocking numbers.																			0002-8487					NOV	2002	131	6					1180	1193		10.1577/1548-8659(2002)131<1180:HSOPAP>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(2002)131<1180:HSOPAP>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000180881100016

Assessment of temporal trends in the water table depth was made with the use of the linear regression analysis. The results obtained indicate that the mean water table depth and mean high and low water table depths were deeper in the soil at the upper part of the slope in comparison with soil located at the footslope. A higher amplitude of water table was observed in Retisols than in Gleysols but the highest variability of water table level was noted in the soils at the footslope compared to those at the slope summit. In Retisols, with each month of observation from 1993 to 2012, the water table showed a tendency to increase. These trends were the highest from January to April, which may be related to the tendency of increasing monthly sums of precipitation in December, January and February. In the Gleysol at the footslope, in the period 1993-2012 and in the vegetation season, the water table depth showed a tendency to decrease. This trend may be due to the impact of water table on the soil water content at the root zone, which is used in the process of evapotranspiration.					; Kozłowski, Michał/AFJ-2077-2022	Komisarek, Jolanta/0000-0002-2986-0229; Kozlowski, Michal/0000-0001-7940-4312													2300-4967	2300-4975				DEC	2017	68	4					167	173		10.1515/ssa-2017-0021	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/ssa-2017-0021													WOS:000433608000001

The Hydrometeorology of the Kariba Catchment Area Based on the Probability Distributions	EARTH INTERACTIONS												In this paper, monthly, maximum seasonal, and maximum annual hydrometeorological (i.e., evaporation, lake water levels, and rainfall) data series from the Kariba catchment area of the Zambezi River basin, Zimbabwe, have been analyzed in order to determine appropriate probability distribution models of the underlying climatology from which the data were generated. In total, 16 probability distributions were considered and the Kolmogorov-Sminorv (KS), Anderson-Darling (AD), and chi-square (x(2)) goodness-of-fit (GoF) tests were used to evaluate the best-fit probability distribution model for each hydrometeorological data series. A ranking metric that uses the test statistic from the three GoF tests was formulated and used to select the most appropriate probability distribution model capable of reproducing the statistics of the hydrometeorological data series. Results showed that, for each hydrometeorological data series, the best-fit probability distribution models were different for the different time scales, corroborating those reported in the literature. The evaporation data series was best fit by the Pearson system, the Lake Kariba water levels series was best fit by the Weibull family of probability distributions, and the rainfall series was best fit by the Weibull and the generalized Pareto probability distributions. This contribution has potential applications in such areas as simulation of precipitation concentration and distribution and water resources management, particularly in the Kariba catchment area and the larger Zambezi River basin, which is characterized by (i) nonuniform distribution of a network of hydrometeorological stations, (ii) significant data gaps in the existing observations, and (iii) apparent inherent impacts caused by climatic extreme events and their corresponding variability.					; Adeola, Abiodun/M-6094-2019; Adeola, Abiodun Morakinyo/M-6094-2019; Botai, Joel/NIV-1657-2025	Botai, Joel/0000-0003-4355-0662; Adeola, Abiodun Morakinyo/0000-0002-6105-7110; 														1087-3562				MAR	2015	19								4	10.1175/EI-D-14-0019.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/EI-D-14-0019.1													WOS:000351597800001

The abundant occurrence of cyanobacteria is accompanied by danger of oxygen imbalance in the aquatic environment and the secretion of toxins that are possible threat to human health and life. Cyanobacterial cell growth depends on a number of physical (temperature, light exposure), chemical (pH, concentration of compounds containing nitrogen and phosphorus) and biological (the presence of other organisms) factors. This paper presents the results of the analysis of water from reservoirs located in southern Wielkopolska region (Pokrzywnica-Szale, Goluchow and Piaski-Szczygliczka). Some important physico-chemical parameters of water samples taken from investigated reservoirs as well as cyanotoxins concentration were determined. Furthermore, the cyanobacterial species were identified. There was also an attempt made to correlate the water parameters with the cyanobacteria development and cyanotoxins production. On the basis of the results obtained in the analyzed season, it can be concluded that water from Pokrzywnica and Goluchow reservoirs was rich in nutrients, hence the intense cyanobacterial blooms and cyanotoxins in water were observed.					; Andrijewski, Grzegorz/C-4862-2015; Szczukocki, Dominik/AAC-4482-2019	Szczukocki, Dominik/0000-0003-1110-019X; Krawczyk, Barbara/0000-0002-0153-5432; 													2083-4772	2083-4810				MAR	2015	41	1					15	23		10.1515/aep-2015-0002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/aep-2015-0002													WOS:000351240000002
J	Herbig, C				Herbig, Christoph			Recent archaeobotanical investigations into the range and abundance of Neolithic crop plants in settlements around Lake Constance and in Upper Swabia (south-west Germany) in relation to cultural influences	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE												An overview is presented of the cultivated plants found at Lake Constance (Bodensee) and in the Upper Swabia region including the Federsee (Baden-Wurttemberg/south-west Germany) between 4000 and 2400 cal BC. This work relates to recent archaeobotanical investigations of the waterlogged sediments of 30 different Neolithic lakeside settlements. These sites provided almost 500,000 crop plant macroremains, excellently preserved under waterlogged conditions. Taken in conjunction with other previously collected samples from the region, they provide an added dimension to the understanding of crop plant development in the lakeshore Neolithic in south-west Germany. Most probably due to cultural impacts from south-east Europe there has been a progressive change in the principal cereals cultivated. In the early phase of the Late Neolithic a tetraploid naked wheat had predominated (Triticum durum Desf/turgidum L). However, emmer (Triticum dicoccon Schrank) became the most abundant cereal during the late phase of the Late Neolithic. A simultaneous increase in the cultivation of flax (Linum usitatissimum L) and poppy (Papaver somniferum L.) is similarly connected to southeastern influences. Superimposed upon this, there were in Upper Swabia complex settlement patterns towards the end of the Neolithic period. There is evidence that some sites were devoted to the cultivation of oil and fibre plants. These sites were probably only used during the growing season and subsequent period of crop processing.

J	Hessen, DO; Skurdal, J; Braathen, JE				Hessen, DO; Skurdal, J; Braathen, JE			Plant exclusion of a herbivore; crayfish population decline caused by an invading waterweed	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												The population of the crayfish Astacus astacus was recorded in Lake Steinsfjorden (southeast Norway) over the period 1979-1996 by studies of total catch effort (baited traps) and catch per unit effort over the season. Over the years 1979-1987, total population of exploitable crayfish (>9.5 cm) was 194,000 (+/-62,000 SD), and the catches were evenly distributed over the shallow areas. After 1987 there was a sudden decrease in population size, reaching a level of 92,000 (+/-22,000 SD) for the 10 years that followed. From 1977 onwards the Canadian pondweed Elodea canadensis invaded the lake and established dense covers over large parts of the shallow areas. The crayfish were gradually excluded from areas covered by Elodea, while the yield from remaining areas remained relatively constant. Direct observation by test-fishing and diving confirmed the virtual absence of crayfish within the Elodea stands. Dense stands may directly interfere with movement of adult crayfish, and also strong fluctuations in O-2 and pH were recorded within the stands, probably acting as a stress factor. Although anoxia was not observed in this survey, it may occur during years of massive dieback of Elodea. Thus, while crayfish are able to feed on Elodea, they are unable to control the rapid growth over large areas of this invader, and somewhat paradoxically the herbivore is spatially excluded by its potential resource.

J	Shun, T; Duffy, CJ				Shun, T; Duffy, CJ			Low-frequency oscillations in precipitation, temperature, and runoff on a west facing mountain front: A hydrogeologic interpretation	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												This paper examines the space-time patterns of annual, interannual, and decadal components of precipitation, temperature, and runoff (P-T-R) using long-record time series across the steep topographic gradient of the Wasatch Front in northern Utah. This region forms the major drainage area to the Great Salt Lake. The approach is to use multichannel singular spectrum analysis as a means of detecting dominant oscillations and spatial patterns in the data and to discuss the relation to the unique mountain and basin hydrologic setting. Results of the analysis show that high-elevation runoff is dominated by the annual and seasonal harmonics, while low-elevation runoff exhibits strong interannual and decadal oscillations. For precipitation and temperature, only the annual/seasonal spectral peaks were found to be significantly different from the underlying noise floor, and these components increase with altitude similar to the mean orographic pattern. Spectral peaks in runoff show a more complex pattern with altitude, with increasing low-frequency components at intermediate and lower elevation. This pattern is then discussed in terms of basin storage effects and groundwater-stream interaction. A conceptual hydrogeologic model for the mountain and basin system proposes how losing streams and deep upwelling groundwater in the alluvial aquifer could explain the strong low-frequency component in streams entering the Great Salt Lake. The phase-plane trajectories of the dominant components for P-T-R are reconstructed as a function of altitude showing the relation of hydrogeologic conditions to the strongest oscillations in mountain runoff and discharge to the Great Salt Lake. The paper shows that weak interannual and decadal oscillations in the climate signal are strengthened where groundwater discharge dominates streamflow.																			0043-1397					JAN	1999	35	1					191	201		10.1029/98WR02818	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/98WR02818													WOS:000078123800017

Although overall intensities of infection were lower than previously, and there were some differences in the relative intensities of individual helminth species, site differences remained significant and were consistent across replicated subsites. In keeping with site differences in helminth infection and adrenal gland weight and asymmetry, voles at site 1 (high intensity infection) had higher circulating concentrations of corticosterone than those at site 2 (low intensity infection). Since males were sampled outside the breeding season, and thus non-scrotal, testosterone levels were low and did not differ between sites. As previously, voles at site 1 also showed greater hind foot asymmetry. Dyadic interactions between males from the same and different sites in the laboratory showed that males from site 1 were significantly less aggressive, especially when confronted with intruder males from site 2. There was no relationship between aggressiveness and intensity of infection overall or at site 1, but a significant negative relationship emerged at site 2. Aggression thus appeared to be downregulated at the higher intensity site independently of individual levels of infection. Terminal corticosterone concentrations were greater at site 1 and lower among residents that initiated more aggression. While corticosterone concentrations rose over the period of testing, they did not correlate with the amount of aggression initiated or received.					; Stachoń, Małgorzata/AGB-0372-2022; Behnke, Jerzy/L-6176-2015	Stachon, Malgorzata/0000-0001-7984-2232; Bajer, Anna/0000-0001-6199-8458; Gromadzka-Ostrowska, Joanna/0000-0002-9529-3744													0022-149X	1475-2697				SEP	2003	77	3					185	195		10.1079/JOH2003194	http://dx.doi.org/10.1079/JOH2003194								12895277					WOS:000184515900001
J	Qu, WC; Morrison, RJ; West, RJ				Qu, WC; Morrison, RJ; West, RJ			Inorganic nutrient and oxygen fluxes across the sediment-water interface in the inshore macrophyte areas of a shallow estuary (Lake Illawarra, Australia)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Rates of inorganic nutrient and oxygen fluxes, and gross community primary productivity were investigated using incubated cores in July, August and September 2001, in a seagrass meadow of Lake Illawarra, a barrier estuary in New South Wales, Australia. The results indicated that rates of gross primary productivity were high, varying from C = 0.62 to 1.89 g m(-2) d(-1); low P/R ratios of 0.28 - 0.48 define the system as heterotrophic and indicate that more carbon is respired than is produced. In order to determine the effect of macroalgae on O-2 and nutrient fluxes, measurements were also conducted on cores from which the macroalgae had been removed. The results showed that the O-2 fluxes during light incubations were significantly lower in the cores without macroalgae ( P < 0.01), indicating that macroalgae could be a significant contributor to the primary production in the lake. In general, nutrient fluxes showed a typical diurnal variation with an efflux from sediments in the dark and a reduced efflux ( or uptake) in the light. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (NO2-+ NO3-+ NH4+) net fluxes were directed from the sediments towards the water column and dominated by the NH4+ fluxes (> 80%). NO2-+ NO3- and o-P fluxes were always very low during the sampling period. The increasing tendency of net nutrient effluxes, especially NH4+ from July to September, is consistent with the increase of the water temperature and seagrass biomasses. However, in September, significantly lower light, dark and net NH4+ effluxes were found in the cores with macroalgae (SA-sediments) compared with the cores without macroalgae (S-sediments). These results support the hypothesis that actively-growing dense macroalgal mats (i.e., algal blooms in September) may act as a filter reducing the flux of nutrients to the water column.

Investigators suggested that changes in delta(15)N values measured in urine, hair, and blood may be a good indicator of lean-tissue losses. During our investigations into the effects of population density on body condition and reproduction of female Arctic ground squirrels (Spermophilus parryii plesius) near Kluane Lake, Yukon, Canada, we examined the relations between body condition and delta(15)N values. Data obtained from 20 livetrapped female ground squirrels suggested that reproductive females from a population with moderate density and low food availability experienced a reduction in body condition, as indicated by mass loss and changes in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and glucose concentrations. In contrast, those from a population that failed to reproduce successfully and had high density and low food availability experienced no nutritional stress. Similarly, those females from a high-density population with high food availability (i.e., supplemented food) that reproduced successfully suffered no noticeable nutritional stress. In contrast to our prediction, delta(15)N values did not show a decline with increasing body mass, and animals in poor and excellent body condition had similar delta(15)N values. In addition, female ground squirrels from the same group with access to similar types of food (natural or supplemented) and with similar body masses, BUN, and blood glucose concentrations showed a difference of up to 1.8% in delta(15)N values. Thus, our results suggest that the ecological process (i.e., diet selection) may have obscured the physiological one (i.e., recycling of nitrogen). Therefore, we recommend that field ecologists studying animal diets using stable-isotope analysis use alternative techniques when attempting to evaluate the body condition of their subjects.																			0008-4301	1480-3283				SEP	1999	77	9					1373	1378		10.1139/cjz-77-9-1373	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-77-9-1373													WOS:000084047400005
J	Ranzi, R; Grossi, G; Bacchi, B				Ranzi, R; Grossi, G; Bacchi, B			Ten years of monitoring areal snowpack in the Southern Alps using NOAA-AVHRR imagery, ground measurements and hydrological data	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Monitoring snow cover in alpine areas is important for the estimation of the water storage during the snowmelt season, especially in view of irrigation, hydropower production and water supply. Cost-efficiency and fine temporal resolution of images from the satellite-borne NOAA-AVHRR sensor indicate this source of information as a suitable candidate for monitoring snow cover extent. This information can also be used for validation of distributed snowmelt models. As a result of a long-term study, ten years of snow covered area depletion curves have been estimated using remote sensing in seven watersheds of size larger than 400 km(2) in the Southern Alps. Coupling of satellite imagery with detailed topographic data and some ground measurements of snowpack depth and density provides regional estimates of snow water equivalent in northern Italy, upstream of Lakes Maggiore, Come, Iseo, Idro, and Garda. The basin water equivalent estimates are compared with the values obtained from the hydrological water balance equation used in two of the selected watersheds and computed for different snowmelt seasons.

J	Kaeding, LR				Kaeding, L. R.			A CLIMATE-BASED INDEX OF HISTORIC SPAWNING-STREAM HYDROLOGY	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Reproductive success of stream-spawning Oncorhynchus fishes (Pacific salmon, rainbow trout, cutthroat trout and their allies) may be greatly affected by stream discharge or its covariate, stream temperature, during the spawning season. Because such data for the physical environment may not have been routinely collected as part of previous investigations of these fishes, identification of simple but robust indices of historic, seasonal stream discharge and temperature, using long-term climate data sets, would be important, especially to investigations of historic population dynamics. This study examined statistical associations among several climate variables and the spawning-season (approximately June) discharges and temperatures of Clear Creek, a Yellowstone Lake tributary used by spawning Yellowstone cutthroat trout, Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri (YCT), from the lake. Correlation analysis showed that total water-year degree-days (calculated on the basis of mean daily air temperature>0 degrees C) at Lake Village, on the lake's north shore, was a robust index (both negative and positive, respectively) of consecutive, total semi-month metrics of creek discharge and temperature during the YCT spawning season. This study (and subsequent use of the Lake Village degree days metric as an environmental variable in a dynamic, age-structured model of the lacustrineadfluvial YCT population of Clear Creek) showed how exploratory analyses of the fragmentary but long-term and regionally unique data sets for Clear Creek discharge and temperature revealed a simple but robust index of climate variation important to understanding the historic dynamics of Clear Creek's YCT population, which is a key spawning stock of Yellowstone Lake. In addition, the extensive statistical associations among the climate variables, along with the temporal trends in two key variables, broadly showed how climate varied across the Yellowstone Lake region during the past several decades. Those observations have implications for the historic, seasonal hydrology of all Yellowstone Lake tributaries used by spawning YCT. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Hancza and L. Dejguny, northeastern Poland) and a "metalimnetic niche" is described. Phytoplankton analysis conducted during July and August 2006, 2007, and 2008 indicated that the total phytoplankton biomass in both lakes was relatively small (from 0.6 to 5.2 mg dm(-3)), with maximum values mainly occurring in the metalimnion. The lowest number of species and diversity indices values were usually observed in the metalimnetic layers. Lake Hancza was dominated by diatoms (e.g. Cyclotella spp.) whereas Lake Dejguny was mainly dominated by cyanoprokaryotes (e.g. Planktothrix agardhii), with a distinct predominance of diatoms (e.g. Tabellaria flocculosa) in 2007. The common features of the phytoplankton assemblages in both lakes were a tolerance to nutrient and light deficiencies. A cluster analysis of the taxonomic patterns indicated large dissimilarities between the lakes. The phytoplankton assemblages developed under the influence of seasonal conditions, especially in Lake Hancza. The distinction between metalimnetic and epilimnetic phytoplankton assemblages only appeared in Lake Dejguny.					; Hutorowicz, Andrzej/O-5061-2019; Napiorkowska-Krzebietke, Agnieszka/I-3874-2018	Hutorowicz, Andrzej/0000-0002-2976-1079; Napiorkowska-Krzebietke, Agnieszka/0000-0001-8361-0290													1730-413X	1897-3191				MAR	2013	42	1					89	98		10.2478/s13545-013-0059-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s13545-013-0059-x													WOS:000317577100011

Species Diversity and Qualitative Assessment of Ground Beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) in Three Riparian Habitats	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												In a 3-yr study involving saltcedar-free, saltcedar-infested, and burned habitats in a riparian area at Lake Meredith, TX, the number of carabid species collected, diversity indices, and indicator species varied significantly among habitats. A 3-yr average of 15, 14, and 24 carabid species were collected from the saltcedar-free, saltcedar-infested, and burned habitats, respectively. Values for species richness, Shannon's and Simpson's diversity indices, and evenness index for pooled data collected from 2005 to 2007 were higher in the burned habitat followed by the saltcedar-free habitat and the saltcedar-infested habitat. Within-year parameters across the three habitats generally followed the pooled data results with some variation. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling analyses clearly indicated groups of carabid species preferred specific habitats. Five species in the burned area had indicator species percentage values >50% (Agonum punctiforme, Agonum texanum, Brachinus alternans, Harpalus pensylvanicus, and Poecilus chalcites). In the saltcedar-infested and saltcedar-free habitats, only one species in each habitat had indicator species percentage values that exceeded 50%: Calathus opaculus and Cicindela punctulata punctulata, respectively.

The experiment was conducted over 4 years (1 pretreatment year followed by 3 years with weekly P additions during the growing season). To avoid any undesirable eutrophication effects, the total P concentration was increased from 4-5 mu g P center dot L-1 to a moderate level of 10-12 mu g P center dot L-1. Compared with the pretreatment year, the P additions increased the average TIN retention in the experimental lake by nearly 70% (from 53 to 88 mmol center dot m(-2)center dot year(-1)) during three growing seasons. However, when considering that the reference lake experienced a 55% decrease in TIN retention during the same period, the increase might have been even larger. This underlines the role of P (both natural and anthropogenic) as an important regulator of N retention in upland lake districts that in large parts of southernmost Norway contribute significantly to the N loading on coastal marine areas.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				FEB	2005	62	2					312	321		10.1139/F04-233	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F04-233													WOS:000228083800007

An endemic population is known on Long Point peninsula, Lake Erie, Ontario, but I. scapularis adults have also been collected from other localities within the province. To test the hypothesis that distribution of the blacklegged tick is limited by cold climatic extremes, 35 fed female, 70 unfed adult, and 70 unfed nymphal I. scapularis were held in containers within four natural habitats on Long Point (42 degrees 36' N; 80 degrees 5' W) and at northern localities near Ottawa (45 degrees 27' N; 75 degrees 42' W), Hearst (49 degrees 40' N; 83 degrees 41' W), and Kenora (49 degrees 47' N; 94 degrees 29' W), Ontario, from early December 1991 until May 1993, At the northern localities 84.8 and 30.5% of fed females and unfed adults survived overwinter, respectively On Long Point, 56.4% of fed females and 23.6% of unfed adults successfully overwintered. Longevity of fed females and unfed adults was increased by >2 mo at the northern localities compared with Long Point, although survival rates for unfed nymphs at the northern sites and on; Long Point were similar. Females within the four habitats on Long Point, and at Kenora and Ottawa, laid eggs from late April to mid-May, whereas eggs were deposited in late June at Hearst. Emergence of larvae from eggs began in late July or early August on Long Point and at Ottawa. Larvae were first observed in early October at Kenora, and no larvae emerged during 1992 at Hearst. Some eggs that overwintered during 1992-1993 at the northern sites were viable; however hatching rate was <10%. The minimum duration of the life cycle of I. scapularis is extended when ticks are introduced into regions of the province with seasonal degree-day accumulations lower than those observed on Long Point. Delays in deposition of eggs and emergence of larvae at Hearst and Kenora were likely a result of insufficient accumulation of degree-days above threshold temperatures for development in 1992. Though some eggs can overwinter successfully suggesting that latitude-related reduction in seasonal temperature may not limit distribution of this tick in Ontario, hatchability was low. This factor, combined with innate incremental mortality at each instar, difficulty in finding a mate, and low density of medium to large mammal hosts for adults, may mitigate against establishment of I. scapularis by introduction of individual ticks into certain northern regions.

Concurrently, ambient conditions including water temperature, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), Secchi disc transparency, dissolved oxygen and phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll-a) were measured. Results of both light- and dark-bottle experiments are used to 1) demonstrate that Lake Apopka is not heterotrophic as reported in the literature, 2) provide preliminary estimates of phytoplankton primary production, 3) discuss shortcomings in experimental methodology and 4) evaluate sources, of temporal variability in phytoplankton primary production. No strong seasonal patterns were found in ambient physical and chemical conditions with the exception of water temperature. Whole-basin estimates of net organic carbon sedimentation are used as an independent approach to estimate phytoplankton primary production. The magnitude of net primary production ranged from approximately I to 2g C m(-2) d(-1) for three direct estimates and from to 3 to 5 g C m(-2) d(-1) for the indirect method. We conclude that short-term temporal variability in primary productivity is controlled mainly by meteorological forcing of wind-induced turbulence and resuspension of meroplankton. Our study shows that obtaining precise and accurate direct estimates of phytoplankton photosynthesis and production are more complex than might be anticipated from the application of standard techniques.

J	Downhower, JF; Brown, LP; Matsui, ML				Downhower, JF; Brown, LP; Matsui, ML			Life history variation in female Gambusia hubbsi	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Gambusia hubbsi populations occur in a variety of fresh and brackish-water habitats on Andros, Bahamas. These include shallow water sites (tidal creeks, lakes, roadside ditches), and blueholes (vertical solution caves). In some blueholes G. hubbsi is the only species present, in others it co-occurs with other species, principal among these is a predator, Eleotris pisonis. By contrast to blueholes, shallow water sites have highly variable temperature and depth. In addition, they are frequented by avian piscivores and may be occasionally occupied by piscivores such as Eleotris. We sampled 10 shallow water sites, 14 blueholes where Eleotris is absent and 12 blueholes where Eleotris co-occurs with G. hubbsi. We measured and compared variation in female body size, fecundity, and reproductive investment among these three habitats. The observed patterns of life history variation are only partially in accord with expectations from theory regarding the effects of predation and seasonality on life history variation. Samples from populations that colonized a series of man-made trenches (Well Fields), a set of introductions into that habitat, and changes in life history traits of lab-raised females from three blueholes, suggest that the observed pattern of life history variation in other habitats also reflects differences in food availability among habitats, and imperfectly reflects the potential phenotypic variability of this species.																			0378-1909	1573-5133				DEC	2000	59	4					415	428		10.1023/A:1026552527018	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1026552527018													WOS:000165661500007
J	Van den Broeke, M				Van den Broeke, Matthew			Seasonally and Diurnally Varying Cold Front Effects along the Minnesotan North Shore of Lake Superior	ATMOSPHERE												Cold fronts are typically associated with cooling, drying and a strengthening wind that shifts to have a northerly component. Cold front effects at a particular point, however, are dependent upon pre-existing air mass characteristics. Here, we examine 634 passages of synoptic-scale cold fronts in northeastern Minnesota from 2010 to 2018. While these fronts are associated with the expected effects in some areas, they are often associated with warming and enhanced drying in the region directly influenced by an air mass from Lake Superior (coastal sites). Coastal sites experience warming during more than half of cold frontal passages, in contrast to proximate inland sites out of the influence of the lake. This warming, combined with a removal of the moist lake air mass, often leads to a sharp post-front decrease in relative humidity. These relatively unusual local effects indicate a need to carefully consider characteristics of the lake air mass and likely changes during cold frontal passage when forecasting regional temperature and fire weather conditions.																				2073-4433				MAR	2022	13	3							441	10.3390/atmos13030441	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos13030441													WOS:000775963700001

Therefore, our goal was to collect and systematize all available phenological data and abundances of gelatinous organisms based on scientific surveys from 1996 to 2020 and a "citizen science" sighting program in the southern Croatian waters. The inter-annual variability and seasonality of planktonic Cnidaria and Ctenophora were described. A total of 590 reports was received from citizens, which summed up to result in 870 data together with the scientists' records. In total, 15 species were recorded. Of these, scyphomedusa Pelagia noctiluca accounted for 34 %, followed by ctenophora Cestum veneris (19 %) and the scyphomedusa Cothylorhiza tuberculata (17 %). Mass occurrence was most frequently found in P. noctiluca and then in C. tuberculata and C. veneris. Isolated mass occurrence was recorded for the freshwater hydromedusa Craspedacusta sowerbii, found in Lake Kuti near the mouth of the Neretva River, and for the scyphomedusa Aurelia cf. solida. The three species A. solida, Mnemiopsis leidyi and C. sowerbii are not native to European waters. Considered that alien species are invading the Adriatic Sea and human impact and global warming are increasing, it is crucial to carefully monitor the occurrence of gelatinous zooplankton taxa and to conduct studies focused on deciphering their ecological impact in marine ecosystems. Therefore, our empirical analysis of 25 years of observations provides essential information on the variation of gelatinous zooplankton in the Southern Adriatic region.

J	Moorhead, DL				Moorhead, Daryl L.			Mesoscale dynamics of ephemeral wetlands in the antarctic dry valleys: Implications to production and distribution of organic matter	ECOSYSTEMS												Ephemeral wetlands in the Antarctic dry valleys alternate as sites of in situ net primary production when inundated and sources of organic matter for eolian export when desiccated. Evidence of this switch was obtained from observations made in two field seasons (2001 and 2003), coincidentally separated by a season of exceptionally high water yield from nearby glaciers (2002). In 2001, organic matter on soil surfaces adjacent to several ponds in Taylor Valley often exceeded 500 g C/m(2). One pond had a total stock of approximately 1,388 kg organic C on soils within 20 m of the shoreline. These materials formed concentric rings around the pond, suggesting historically higher water levels, consistent with aerial photographs taken a decade earlier (1993). In 2003, these materials were submerged by water apparently received during the intervening year. Also in 2003, pitfall traps were placed along the edges of exposed organic matter adjacent to another pond to evaluate organic material erosion by wind. Over 4.5 days, traps collected 0.22 +/- 0.12 to 2.91 +/- 1.68 g C/m(2), both confirming and quantifying wind transport. These results indicate that organic matter production and movement, driven by seasonal and decadal patterns of inundation/desiccation of small, ephemeral wetlands, overlay longer term (centuries and millennia) and larger scale (landscape) patterns of production and distribution driven by regional fluctuations in hydrological balance between glaciers and large freshwater lakes.																			1432-9840	1435-0629				FEB	2007	10	1					86	94		10.1007/s10021-006-9005-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-006-9005-8													WOS:000246766000009
J	Koren, N; Klein, M				Koren, N; Klein, M			Rate of sedimentation in Lake Kinneret, Israel: Spatial and temporal variations	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												The rate of sedimentation in Lake Kinneret was measured over several years by means of sediment traps, in up to seven different locations in the lake. Gross sedimentation rates measured in the sediment traps vary from about 1.5 kg m(-2) a(-1) in the deepest part of the lake up to 10 kg m(-2) a(-1) near the mouth of the upper Jordan river. The rate of sedimentation near the Jordan's inflow is highly correlated to flow discharge in the river, while in the centre of the lake the seasonal sedimentation pattern is mainly correlated to the bloom period of Peridinium gatunense. During the bloom period of Peridinium gatunense sedimentation rates all over the lake are very similar, indicating that the Peridinium is evenly distributed in the lake. The average suspended sediment discharge of the upper Jordan river flowing into the lake is 41 000 ton a(-1).

J	Power, M; McKinley, RS				Power, M; McKinley, RS			Latitudinal variation in lake sturgeon size as related to the thermal opportunity for growth	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The relationships between age-specific total lengths, weights, condition factors, and a measure of the thermal opportunity for growth (TOG; calculated as the sum of degree-days greater than 5 degrees C) were estimated for lake sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens from data available for 16 populations spread throughout much of the species' natural range. The TOG explained a significant proportion of the observed variation in length at age irrespective of age. Correlations between weight at age and condition factor improved significantly as lake sturgeon aged, although TOG remained a poor indicator of the differences in condition at age among sturgeon populations. As elsewhere in the literature, declines in length and weight at age occurred at higher latitudes. However, growth rates (mm/degree-day), when adjusted for TOG, showed a significant inverse relationship between growth rates and latitude. The latitudinal countergradient in growth rates partially compensates for reduced growth opportunities in northern populations of lake sturgeon.																			0002-8487					JUL	1997	126	4					549	558		10.1577/1548-8659(1997)126<0549:LVILSS>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1997)126<0549:LVILSS>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1997XU26600001

The data revealed a significant accumulation of LAS in Burullus and Edku water, sediments, and fish muscle compared to those recorded in the Nile River as a reference site. The study showed seasonal changes in the serum concentrations of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione reductase (GSH) for fish tilapia. The ANOVA test displayed a significant difference between different seasons (p <= .001). The results of the current study exhibited the effect of increasing the concentration of LAS on the fishes of Burullus and Edku lagoons. The study showed low concentrations of serum activity, CAT, SOD and GSH in comparison with the values in the control fish (Nile River fish). It causes oxidative stress, severe disruption, followed by cytotoxicity. In excessive production of reactive oxygen species, the serum of SOD, CAT and GSH are exploited for detoxification. Alterations in histopathological structure were observed in both Burullus, and Edku fish liver and gills compared to those in the control fish.					; Hagres, Ahmed/KCJ-4983-2024	hagras, ahmed/0000-0002-1159-5703; Elgammal, Maie/0000-0003-1473-2117; 													0275-7540	1029-0370				MAR 16	2022	38	3					233	251		10.1080/02757540.2022.2032002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02757540.2022.2032002		FEB 2022											WOS:000762210800001

The sites vary in surficial geology, elevation, vegetation, and precipitation seasonality, and these differences provide a tool to evaluate the importance of large-scale climatic change relative to localized catchment proces%s on aquatic ecosystem evolution. All assemblages underwent synchronous shifts in community structure in the intervals of 13.9-13.8, 13.2-13.1, 11.3-11.0 and 8.8-8.7 cal ka. The shift at 11.3-11.0 cal ka also is evident in other proxy records from these sites, such as pollen and charcoal, which suggests large-scale climatic influences on both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Because the shifts in diatom assemblages are synchronous in lakes with variable geological settings and local precipitation patterns, we infer that large-scale climatic change was the principal driver of aquatic ecosystem evolution in this region during the late-Glacial and early Holocene periods.

J	Thys, I; Leporcq, B; Descy, JP				Thys, I; Leporcq, B; Descy, JP			Seasonal shifts in phytoplankton ingestion by Daphnia galeata, assessed by analysis of marker pigments	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												To determine food selectivity in Daphnia galeata, a common freshwater cladoceran, the carotenoid pigments in the guts of animals collected in a meso-eutrophic reservoir were analysed. Using the ratios of carotenoid to chlorophyll a for the main marker pigments enabled an investigation of the algal diet of this herbivorous zooplankton at the class level in natural conditions. To allow a comparison with data from pigments, food-removal experiments were carried out using Daphnia spp. isolated from the lake, fed with the algal assemblages present in the lake at different times. For both methods, based on gut-pigment analysis and food removal, the total and class-specific grazing rates were calculated, and food selection over time was assessed from the mean of selectivity indexes. Except for three dates, both methods agreed on the qualitative composition of the diet of D. galeata. This herbivorous species fed preferentially on the most available algae in the edible size range, and showed positive selection for cyanobacteria and cryptophytes during most of the growing season. The gut-pigment method seems to be an interesting tool for following the algal selectivity of freshwater cladocerans in natural conditions.

J	Majewski, MS; Foreman, WT; Goolsby, DA				Majewski, MS; Foreman, WT; Goolsby, DA			Pesticides in the atmosphere of the Mississippi River Valley, part I - rain	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Weekly composite rainfall samples were collected in three paired urban and agricultural regions of the Midwestern United States and along the Mississippi River during April-September 1995. The paired sampling sites were located in Mississippi, Iowa, and Minnesota. A background site, removed from dense urban and agriculture areas, was located near Lake Superior in Michigan. Herbicides were the predominant type of pesticide detected at every site. Each sample was analyzed for 47 compounds and 23 of 26 herbicides, 13 of 18 insecticides, and three of three related transformation products were detected in one or more sample from each paired site. The detection frequency of herbicides and insecticides were nearly equivalent at the paired Iowa and Minnesota sites. In Mississippi, herbicides were detected more frequently at the agricultural site and insecticides were detected more frequently at. the urban site. The highest total wet depositional amounts (mu g pesticide/m(2) per season) occurred at the agricultural sites in Mississippi (1980 mu g/m(2)) and Iowa (490 mu g/m(2)) and at the urban site in Iowa (696 mu g/m(2)). Herbicides accounted for the majority of the wet depositional loading at the Iowa and Minnesota sites, but methyl parathion (1740 mu g/m(2)) was the dominant compound contributing to the total loading at the agricultural site in Mississippi. Atrazine, CIAT (a transformation product of atrazine and propazine) and dacthal were detected most frequently (76, 53, and 53%, respectively) at the background site indicating their propensity for long-range atmospheric transport.

Initial increases in the population of this species were associated with windy days and the first downward movement of the thermocline into an anoxic hypolimnion after an extended period of stable stratification and no flow. Exponential growth and bloom formation coincided with the arrival and retention of first wet-season inflows into the river impoundment. Cyanobacteria and rotifers dominated the planktonic assemblage and chytrids (cyanobacterial pathogens) were present when the cell density of cyanobacteria peaked.

J	Forney, WM				Forney, William M.			Nutrients across Time: Relationships with Climate, Hydrology, and Land Use in Four Rivers of the Pacific Northwest	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Understanding the temporal dynamics and drivers of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) provides a critical link to better management of nutrient-related impacts such as eutrophication and harmful algal blooms (HABs). DIN and DIP are a primary control on persistent eutrophication and HABs in the Pacific Northwest (PNW). An understudied phenomenon, this paper examines multi-decadal trends in DIN and DIP concentrations and loads, and their relationships to climatic and hydrologic factors (e.g., stream and air temperature, discharge, precipitation) in the PNW. Dissolved constituents act as a broad sentinel of linkages between watershed and in-stream mechanisms such as nitrification, denitrification, nutrient use efficiency, evapotranspiration, hydrologic connectivity, groundwater extraction, irrigation, and land uses. As opposed to the total N and P often used in individual, autochthonous, lentic systems, DIN and DIP are used here as measures of multiscaled processes in allochthonous lotic systems with diverse flow paths. Time-series data from public agencies were used for up to 20 years in river outlets from the Willamette, Salmon, Spokane, and Yakima watersheds. Seasonal Mann Kendall (SMK) tests suggest significant decreasing multi-decadal trends in DIN and DIP loads for three out of four watersheds (for DIN, SMK = -0.104; for DIP, SMK = -0.081, -0.181, and -0.213), significant decreasing trends in DIN concentrations for one of the four watersheds (SMK = -0.144), and significant decreasing trends in DIP concentrations in three of the four watersheds (SMK = -0.120, -0.135, and -0.157). Multivariate regressions found significant relationships for concentrations, loads, and ratios when regressed against stream and air temperatures, precipitation, and discharge (16 significant regressions, with adjusted R-2 values between 0.016 and 0.65). Highlights of these regression results are as follows: (1) precipitation, discharge, and water and air temperatures help to explain DIN and DIP concentrations and loads, (2) changes in DIN concentrations are sensitive to more hydroclimatic variables than DIP concentrations, and (3) DIP concentrations are positively correlated with stream temperature while DIP loads are negatively correlated with stream temperature. Furthermore, seasonal changes in nutrients - and their potential to alter aquatic productivity during a year - has received little attention in the literature. Regressions established significant seasonality or monthly variation of DIN and DIP concentrations and loads in all four watersheds (20 significant regressions, with adjusted R-2 values between 0.038-0.65). Nutrient thresholds of DIN (0.3-0.5 mg/L) and DIP (0.05-0.005 mg/L) concentrations were used to analyze N- and P-limitation. P-limitation is known to occur in lakes, and N-limitation is known to occur in rivers. Surprisingly, except for one watershed (Salmon), nutrient concentrations for both DIN and DIP in all watersheds were shown to be above the limitation thresholds across multiple seasons. In certain situations, such as where significant decreasing trends continue, the DIN:DIP ratio suggests seasonal switching between N- and P-limited could create ideal conditions for HABs. The findings of this study have important implications for water resource management issues such as agriculture, land use development, fish populations, timber harvests, water quality, and public health.																			1093-474X	1752-1688				APR	2022	58	2					220	247		10.1111/1752-1688.12993	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1752-1688.12993		FEB 2022											WOS:000755112100001

J	Hebert, CE; Morrison, HA				Hebert, CE; Morrison, HA			Consumption of fish and other prey items by Lake Erie waterbirds	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Lake Erie. provides valuable habitat for large populations of waterbirds that rely on fish and other aquatic biota for food. To better understand the relationship between waterbirds and their prey, it is important to quantify the role of waterbirds in the food web. Field observations of their population sizes and diet preferences were applied to a bioenergetics model to estimate consumption of fish and other items by waterbird species occupying the three basins of Lake Erie in the late 1990s. The total quantity of fishes consumed annually by resident and migrating birds on Lake Erie Was 18,776 metric tons. Fish consumption by nesting and migrant waterbirds was greatest in the western basin of Lake Erie (14,784 metric tons/yr) followed by the eastern (2,078 metric tons/yr) and central (1, 914 metric tons/yr) basins. Migrant populations of red-breasted mergansers consumed the most fish (6,612 metric tons/yr). These diving ducks consumed approximately 35% of the total amount of fish consumed by waterbirds on the lake. Nesting populations of double-crested cormorants (5,857 metric tons/yr), nesting populations of herring gulls (1,597 metric tons/yr), and migrant common mergansers (1,149 metric tons/yr), were the second, third, and fourth largest consumers of fish from Lake Erie, respectively. Waterbirds consume approximately four times more fish by weight than were harvested by Ontario's commercial fishery in 2000; however, in general, the species of fishes most often consumed by waterbirds are not of economic importance. However, there may be exceptions to this rule.																			0380-1330						2003	29	2					213	227		10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70428-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70428-6													WOS:000183819000002
J	Lee, HW; Park, SS				Lee, Hye Won; Park, Seok Soon			A hydrodynamic modeling study to estimate the flushing rate in a large coastal embayment	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												A three-dimensional hydrodynamics model was applied to a coastal embayment on the west coast of the Korean Peninsula to examine the potential effects of a large reclamation project (the Saemangeum Project). To understand and analyze the impacts of the coastal structures associated with the Project on the hydrodynamics, as well as the composition ratio of the saltwater to freshwater, the seasonal distribution of the residence time and flushing rate were examined using the salinity and tracer simulation as dilution indicators. The calibrated and verified model was used to examine changes in the tidal elevation, salinity, residence time and flushing rate. The results indicate that the completion of the fourth sea dike will limit circulation, and that the salinity inside the dike would be dominated by rainfall and runoff. The flushing rate was estimated to decrease after the construction of the dike, such that biogeochemical changes could occur in the sea water and sediment. From this study, it was concluded that the three-dimensional hydrodynamic model can successfully simulate the changes in elevation, residence time and flushing rate in the Saemangeum Embayment and become a useful tool for determining a management plan to maintain the water quality of coastal embayments.

Monitoring studies should be planned during any wide-scale malaria control program integrating insecticide-treated materials, to evaluate their effects and effectiveness on epidemiologically relevant parameters. Such operational control interventions may be challenged by insecticide resistance spread within vector populations, as a result of wide insecticide pressure. A nationwide distribution of long-lasting insecticidal nets was implemented throughout Niger in 2005. We studied the population genetic structure of major malaria vectors across Nigerien Sahel, and investigated potential effects of this large malaria control intervention. Wild-caught Anopheles gambiae sensu lato females from seven villages and two wet seasons were genotyped at 12 microsatellite loci. The genetic diversity within both species appeared homogenous between villages and years. The estimated genetic differentiation among samples was very low within both species, indicating high gene flow across the area. An absence of differentiation was also found between 2005 and 2006 wet seasons, for all samples but one, showing that the net distribution did not impact significantly the genetic diversity and structure of vector populations in a single year. We provide valuable results participating to document effects of large malaria control programs, to maximize the efficiency of available tools in future interventions.					ariey, frederic/P-1185-2017; Duchemin, Jean-Bernard/AAE-8077-2020; Brisse, Sylvain/M-8723-2013; ROGIER, Christophe/C-2550-2008; Duchemin, Jean-Bernard/D-7000-2011	Duchemin, Jean-Bernard/0000-0001-5044-4855; Czeher, Cyrille/0000-0001-6192-5216; Brisse, Sylvain/0000-0002-2516-2108; LABBO, Rabiou/0000-0002-4373-4974; 													0022-2585	1938-2928				MAY	2010	47	3					355	366		10.1603/ME09173	http://dx.doi.org/10.1603/ME09173								20496583					WOS:000277597000010

Forest and Surface Water As Predictors of Borrelia burgdorferi and Its Vector Ixodes scapularis (Acari: Ixodidae) in Indiana	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY												The objective of this study was to assess whether the distribution of Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, and its vector tick Ixodes scapularis Say (Acari: Ixodidae) across Indiana is influenced by large-scale landscape features, specifically the proportion of forest within the surrounding landscape and the distance to water features such as lakes and major streams. Hunter-killed deer were checked for ticks in designated check-stations in the opening firearm hunting season between 2005 and 2007. Hunting locations for 3,600 deer were used in ArcGIS (ESRI, Redlands, CA) to examine the influence of forest and water features in the surrounding area on the occurrence of the tick and bacteria. In total, 82 of the 92 (89%) Indiana counties were sampled from 2005 to 2007. The proportion of tick-infested deer was 13.6, 15.8, and 25.5% in these years, respectively. There was a significant nonlinear response for I. scapularis to forest cover in 1 yr that indicated a greater probability of this tick presence at intermediate levels of forest area. Infested does were harvested in significantly more forested areas than bucks. No significant correlation was found neither between levels of forest area and B. burgdorferi nor between water bodies and both organisms.

Cores representing approximately 100 yr of accumulation have increasing concentrations of organic matter over this period, indicating increased accumulation of organic carbon, rapid early diagenesis, or a combination of these processes. Stable carbon isotopes and organic tracers show that virtually all of this increase is of marine origin. Evidence from two cores near the river mouth, one within the region of chronic seasonal hypoxia and one nearby but outside the hypoxic region, indicate that changes consistent with increased productivity began by approximately the mid-1950s when the inorganic carbon in benthic forams rapidly became isotopically lighter at both stations. Beginning in the mid-1960s, the accumulation of organic matter, organic delta(13)C and delta(15)N all show large changes in a direction consistent with increased productivity. This last period coincides with a doubling of the load of nutrients from the Mississippi River, which levelled off in the mid-1980s. These data support the hypothesis that anthropogenic nutrient loading has had a significant impact on the Louisiana shelf.

REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ZOOLOGIA												Species richness and diversity of waterbirds of a natural lake In southeastern Brazil. Increases and decreases of waterfowl population have been used as an indicator of water quality and habitat quality. The aim of this paper was to survey and monitor waterfowl population at the largest natural lake of the 'Area of Environmental Protection' of Lagoa Santa, Southeast Brazil. The 'Lagoa do Sumidouro' holds approximately 253 ha with a 12,072 m of perimeter. Species richness and abundance was estimated from June 1999 to December 2002, It was recorded 27 species of 12 families. Twelve species were considered residents, while eight migratory and another seven species did not present any seasonal pattern. Ardeidae was the most representative family holding 23% of the species followed by Anatidae (15%) and Socolopacidae (11%). Platalea ajaja Linnaeus, 1758 is considered threatened to extinction, while Mycteria americana Linnaeus, 1758 and Ciconia maguari (Gmelin, 1789) are considered rare for the state of Minas Gerais.There was no difference of species richness among the three main seasons ('wet,'dry', and 'transitional'). Species diversity was higher during the wet season. The occurrence of threatened and migratory species at 'Lagoa do Sumidouro' makes the lake an area of extreme biological importance.

California. Previous work reported on basic ecological parameters including distribution, abundance, and species composition of these algal (cyanobacterial)dominated crusts. As a step toward building an ecological model in support of the military installation natural resources management plan, we determined the photosynthetic rate of the algal crusts under controlled laboratory conditions using a portable photosynthesis system. We examined the relation between the environmental conditions of light intensity, crust moisture content. antecedent crust moisture content, and atmospheric CO2 concentration, on photosynthetic rates. Maximal photosynthetic rates were 4.97 and 7.75 mumol m(-2) s(-1) for cryptobiotic crusts collected from dunes (upland crusts) and from pans (aquatic remnant crusts), respectively, which corresponds well with the upper range of previous reports for such algal crusts. Light saturation levels were about 1500 and 1500-2000 mumol m(-2) s(-1) for cryptobiotic crusts from both the dunes and the pans respectively. Optimal moisture content of the crusts for photosynthesis was 15-30% and 90-100% for crusts from dunes and pans respectively: both lower and higher moisture contents resulted in decreased rates of photosynthesis. With increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations up to at least 1000 ppm, photosynthesis of both sorts of crusts increased linearly to rates several times that of rates at natural CO2 concentrations.																			0367-2530	1618-0585					2002	197	2					143	151		10.1078/0367-2530-00024	http://dx.doi.org/10.1078/0367-2530-00024													WOS:000174653800007
J	Johnson, RM; Warburton, J				Johnson, RM; Warburton, J			Annual sediment budget of a UK mountain torrent	GEOGRAFISKA ANNALER SERIES A-PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												Research into torrent erosion focuses heavily on bedload transport dynamics and debris flow propagation during specific events. As a result, there is limited understanding of the sediment budgets operating in torrent systems over longer time-scales. The aim of this study is to construct a sediment budget of the main geomorphological processes operating in a mountain torrent sediment system over a full year. The study site is Iron Crag which is a small torrent system (catchment area 2.4 ha) situated in the northern Lake District, UK. The site has the characteristic morphology of a torrent: multiple hillslope sediment sources, steep channel, gorges, and a basal alluvial fan. A measurement scheme was designed to monitor process activity, linking the sediment sources and sinks, from December 1998 to December 1999. Over this time period the sediment budget demonstrates that 184 tonnes of sediment was supplied to the alluvial fan (which acted primarily as a sediment sink). Channel (70%) and bank (25%) sources dominated the sediment supply, and surface processes and rockfall on the hillslopes (5%) made only a minor contribution. Temporal variations in process activity are significant. Surface processes and rockfall display seasonal variations in yield, whilst channel and bank yields are influenced by individual storm events. Site-specific meteorological data are used to explain these observations and freeze-thaw activity and rainfall characteristics are shown to be important controlling factors.																			0435-3676	1468-0459					2002	84A	2					73	88		10.1111/1468-0459.00162	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1468-0459.00162													WOS:000178655600001

These lakes were both affected by sewage inputs driving them to a high trophic status. However, whereas sewage inputs entered Laguna del Pueblo directly, wastewater reached Laguna de Manjavacas after running for 8 km through a small riverbed, where natural processes caused partial mineralisation of organic matter. Moreover, water quality was further improved before entering the main water body of Laguna de Manjavacas, since water crossed through a wetland and high amounts of organic matter and inorganic nutrients were retained there. Anyway, in both lakes spatial heterogeneity was mainly associated with the distance to sewage inputs, and this was also reflected by the sediment chemistry. The patterns of water evaporation and precipitation-dissolution of salts strongly determined the salinity of their waters. During the warmest period (which coincided with the main drought period) water losses by evaporation increased water salinity, whereas a higher dilution was found during the cold rainy period. However, the relatively higher amount of low-salinity sewage inputs in Laguna del Pueblo allowed this lake to maintain its hyposaline characteristics. In contrast, Laguna de Manjavacas shifts from hyposaline to hypersaline following the seasonal cycle with different rain and temperature regimes, as the relative importance of the permanent wastewater inputs was lower here than in Laguna del Pueblo. Inorganic nutrient dynamics was determined in both lakes both by the sewage supply and by consumption by phytoplankton, with soluble P depletion following algal blooms.

J	Karpuz, NK; Jansen, E				Karpuz, Nalan Koc; Jansen, Eystein			A HIGH-RESOLUTION DIATOM RECORD OF THE LAST DEGLACIATION FROM THE SE NORWEGIAN SEA: DOCUMENTATION OF RAPID CLIMATIC CHANGES	PALEOCEANOGRAPHY												Although the pulsating nature and the abruptness of the last deglaciation are well documented in marine and land records, very few marine records have so far been able to capture the high-frequency climatic changes recorded in the Greenland ice core Dye 3. We studied high-resolutions sediment cores from SE Norwegian Sea, which display a detailed climatic record during the last deglaciation comparable to that of Dye 3. Accelerator mass spectrometray age control of the cores enables us to correlate this record in detail with continental records. The results indicate that the surface waters of the SE Norwegian Sea were seasonally ice free after 13,400 B. P. The Bolling/Allerod interstadial complex (13,200-11,200 B. P.) was a climatically unstable period with changing Arctic-Subarctic conditions. This period was punctuated by four progressively more severe sea surface temperature (SST) minima: between 12,900-12,800 B. P. (BCP I); 12,500-12,400 B. P. (BCP II); 12,300-12,000 B. P. (OD I); and 11,800-11,500 B. P. (OD II). The Younger Dryas (YD) (11,200-10,200 B. P.) represents the severest and most prolonged cold episode of this series of climatic deteriorations. It was bounded by very rapid SST changes and characterized by Arctic-Polar conditions. The first true warm Atlantic water incursion to the SE Norwegian Sea took place around 10,100 B. P., followed by a brief cooler condition between 9900-9600 B. P. (YD II). The early Holocene climatic optimum occurred between 8000-5000 B.P. A conceptual model is proposed where meltwater fluxes are suggested to cause the observed instability in the SST record.

Biological Interpretation of the Third Main Factor Influencing the Long-Term Dynamics of Hydrological and Ecological Parameters of the Three Naroch Lakes under Changing Nutrient Load in 1978-2015	CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY												The data of continuous monitoring of the Naroch Lakes system, which includes eutrophic Lake Batorino, mesotrophic Lake Myastro, and oligo-mesotrophic Lake Naroch, are used to search for the factors most affecting the long-term dynamics of the state of a lake ecosystem under a changing nutrient load. The set of continuous series of seasonal mean values of eight parameters of each ecosystem obtained in 1978-2015 is analyzed by singular spectrum analysis (SSA) and principal component analysis (PCA). The third principal component (F3), which contributed 8.2, 9.8, and 13.3% to the dynamics of ecosystems of Lake Batorino, Lake Myastro, and Lake Naroch, respectively, turns out to be connected with phyto- and zooplankton biomass, as well as with the parameters characterizing the processes of destruction and biochemical decomposition of organic matter. A comparison of statistical relationships and periods of the dominant cyclic components of principal components F3 and the associated parameters of ecosystems allow us to conclude that the interpretation of the third main factor under conditions of changing nutrient load depend on the characteristics of a particular ecosystem. In nutrient-rich ecosystems, it can be interpreted as the transfer of produced primary organic matter to consumers of the next trophic level, related to the structure of the food chain in the ecosystem. In the ecosystems where the process of primary production is limited by nutrient(s), this factor is represented by the available amount of nutrients, which is the third main factor affecting its long-term dynamics.

Reproductive costs, condition and carotenoid-based colour in natural populations of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus)	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Male threespine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, display an orange/red throat during the breeding season, which is carotenoid-based colour. We examined the relationship between energy-based costs of reproduction and colour in three lacustrine populations of threespine stickleback: two benthic (Willow and Big Beaver) and one limnetic (Lynne) ecotypes. In two lakes (Willow and Big Beaver) where benthic males defend nests against cannibalistic groups, males paid higher energy costs than in the third lake (Lynne) where cannibalistic groups are absent. We then examined colour variation within each population. Males from Lynne Lake did not change colour during the parental stage, whereas males from Willow and Big Beaver lakes became more intensely coloured. In addition, colour was typically independent of condition within stages. We propose that energy-based reproductive costs could explain some of the observed variation in colour by altering the payoffs associated with signalling effort during current versus future reproduction.																			0906-6691	1600-0633				JUN	2008	17	2					292	302		10.1111/j.1600-0633.2007.00279.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0633.2007.00279.x													WOS:000255552200009

A community-based bacteriological study of quality of drinking-water and its feedback to a rural community in Western Maharashtra, India	JOURNAL OF HEALTH POPULATION AND NUTRITION												A longitudinal study of the bacteriological quality of rural water supplies was undertaken for a movement towards self-help against diseases, such as diarrhoea, and improved water management through increased community participation. Three hundred and thirteen water samples from different sources, such as well, tank, community standpost, handpumps, percolation lakes, and streams, and from households were collected from six villages in Maharashtra, India, over a one-year period. Overall, 49.8% of the 313 samples were polluted, whereas 45.9% of the samples from piped water supply were polluted. The quality of groundwater was generally good compared to open wells. Irregular and/or inadequate treatment of water, lack of drainage systems, and domestic washing near the wells led to deterioration in the quality of water. No major diarrhoeal epidemics were recorded during the study, although a few sporadic cases were noted during the rainy season. As a result of a continuous feedback of bacteriological findings to the community, perceptions of the people changed with time. An increased awareness was observed through active participation of the people cutting across age-groups and different socioeconomic strata of the society in village activities.																			1606-0997	2072-1315				JUN	2008	26	2					139	150											18686548					WOS:000257767800003

We evaluated the phenotypic plasticity in life history and behavioural traits of two coexisting Daphnia. species, D. pulicaria (2 mm) and D. galeata mendotae (1. 4 mm), in response to seasonal changes in predation by YOY yellow perch. (Perca, flavescens) in a mesotrophic lake. We expected that the large-sized D. pulicaria, the most likely subjected to size-selective predation by YOY perch, will show stronger antipredator responses than the small-sized D. galeata mendotae. To test this hypothesis, we examined changes in life history) and behavioural traits in juveniles and adults of both species during four TOY fish predation periods that were selected based on the presence of YOY perch. in the pelagic zone and the relative abundance of Daphnia prey in their gut contents. Our study supports the scenario of negative size-selective predation by gape-limiled YOY perch on both Daphnia species. The electivity index indicated that no daphnids with a body length > 1. 75 nun were predated by YOY yellow perch. Coexisting Daphnia exhibited phenotypic plasticity in their antipredator defenses based on their vulnerability to seasonal changes in size-selective predation of YOY perch. Juvenile Daphnia were the targeted prey and they responded by a decreased body length. Behavioural defenses were the dominant strategy used by both adult Daphnia populations to withstand high predation. A decreased size at maturity was not employed by Daphnia, except at the very end of the predation period. Behavioural defenses are short-term strategy adopted to avoid predation. Both antipredator defenses became unnecessary expenses and were no longer sustained after the predation period.

The examined lake margin deposits without purple beds at Sinsu Island are overlain by the Gusandong Tuff, and are thus correlated with the upper part of the Haman Formation. The main lithofacies of the lake margin deposits at Sinsu Island consist of planar-to cross-laminated medium-to fine-grained sandstone (sand flat deposits), alternation of fine-grained sandstone and shale or mudstone (mud flat deposits), calcareous silty mudstone (mud flat deposits with pedogenic carbonates), and intraformational clast-bearing coarse-grained sandstone to pebble conglomerate (sand flat -mud flat). Four ranks are assigned to these deposits according to their relative proximity to source area. On the basis of the stratigraphic changes of these proximity ranks, six types of cyclic sedimentation are recognized: alternation of siltstone and mudstone laminae, alternation of fine-grained sandstone and shale (a few mm to 1 cm thick), alternation of sandstone-dominated intervals and shale-dominated intervals within the intervals of alternation of fine-grained sandstone and shale (a few cm thick), alternation of planar-to cross-laminated medium-to fine-grained sandstone and interlaminated to thin-bedded fine-grained sandstone and shale (a few cm to a few decimeters thick), alternation of interlaminated to thin-bedded fine-grained sandstone and shale and calcrete-bearing deposits (a few cm thick), and alternation of calcrete-rich deposits and calcrete-poor deposits (more or less 10 m thick). These cyclic sedimentation might have resulted from the fluctuation of sheetflood energy due to seasonal changes and short-term to long-term climate changes. The characteristics of the cyclic deposits at Sinsu Island are compared to those recorded in the lake margin deposits of the overlying Jindong Formation. This reflects that lithological changes from the Haman Formation (alluvial plain deposits) to the Jindong Formation (lake margin deposits) was attributed to climate change.																			0435-4036	2288-7377					2007	43	1					1	19																WOS:000410554000001

Concentrations of Mn, As, and other metals were determined in water, sediment,. sh tissues ( Puntius gonionotus) and pond snails ( Filopaludina martensi). Sampling was carried out in 3 periods ( February, May, and August) in 2005. Metal analysis was performed by using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer ( ICP- MS). Concentrations of Mn and As in lakewater ranged from 40 - 382 and 0.68 - 8.79 mu g L-1 whereas the USEPA ( Mn) and WHO ( As) guidelines for drinking water are 50 and 10 mu g L-1, respectively. Concentrations of some metals ( Al, Cr, Mn, and Fe) in water were found to be higher in the area where water. owed into the lake from a small river than in other areas. The highest metal concentrations were found in the period of the dry season ( May 2005). Among different sampling sites, the patterns of metal accumulations were different. Estimated fishery product consumption from the lake was calculated and the results indicated that the concentrations of metals in these products were lower than the recommended average daily dietary intake. Therefore, the consumption of. sh and pond snail from this water resource may not pose a risk of metal toxicity. However, monitoring of the levels of Mn and As in lakewater should be carried out routinely so that appropriate prevention of contamination from these toxic metals can be implemented.

We used a model (MEL-GEM, Marine Biological Laboratory General Ecosystem Model) of ecosystem C and nitrogen (N) dynamics to predict and analyze historical (1829-1990) changes in C storage in a N-limited, tussock-tundra ecosystem near Toolik Lake on the North Slope of Alaska. The model simulates stand-level photosynthesis and N uptake by plants, allocation of C and N to foliage, stems, and fine roots, respiration in these tissues, turnover of biomass through litterfall, and decomposition of litter and soil organic matter. We first calibrated the model by deriving a single parameter set that closely simulated the response of tussock tundra to decade-long experimental manipulations of nutrients, temperature, light, and atmospheric CO2. The calibrated model predicts that historical increases in temperature and atmospheric CO2 have increased total ecosystem C storage. Higher temperatures increased soil and plant respiration, but those losses of C were overcompensated by increased photosynthesis resulting from redistribution of N from soil to plants. This redistribution of N was due to increased net mineralization and uptake of N. Increases in atmospheric CO, also increased photosynthesis, but consequent increases in C storage were constrained by limits on increases in the C:N ratio of vegetation. In contrast, hypothesized historical decreases in soil moisture substantially decreased simulated total ecosystem C storage as a result of large increases in soil respiration. With decreased soil moisture, increases in photosynthesis associated with redistribution of N from soil to plants only partially compensated for respiratory C losses, as plant uptake of N could not keep pace with increased N mineralization rates. Consequent losses of N from the ecosystem contributed to the declines in C storage under drier conditions. Based on the combined effects of reconstructed historical changes in atmospheric CO2, mean growing-season temperature, and two alternative soil moisture scenarios, the model predicts a -5.4 to +2.3% change in ecosystem C from 1829 to 1990. These estimates are consistent with field evidence that historically recent changes in C storage of tussock tundra have been relatively small. However, the model also predicts that relatively large transient losses of ecosystem C (50-180 g.m(-2).yr(-1)) may frequently have occurred since the late 1800s, with one of the largest simulated C losses of the 20th century occurring from 1988 to 1990 (3-yr average = 133 g C.m(-2).yr(-1)). These simulated losses were similar to losses measured in tussock tundra at Toolik Lake from 1983 to 1990 (e.g., 1990 losses = 156 g Cm-2.yr(-1)) but nonetheless suggest that these measured losses may be transitory in nature.

A backward water vapor transfer model was also employed to investigate the contribution of water vapor evapotranspiration from the Gyaring and Ngoring lakes and various surface types to the local precipitation. The results show that without the Gyaring and Ngoring lakes, the sensible heat is increased by 120%, whereas the latent heat is decreased by 58.5%, and the height of atmospheric boundary layer increases from 500 to 1,500-2,000 m during daytime over the lake area. The sum of sensible and latent heat fluxes in the lake area simulated by the experiment with and without the lakes is 185.8 and 130.3 W m(-2), respectively. The precipitation amount over the lake area is significantly increased without considering the lake effect, generally by more than 20-40 mm. About 63.8% of the total precipitation in Gyaring and Ngoring lakes is contributed by the external water vapor sources. The evapotranspiration from the grassland is the secondary water vapor source for the precipitation in the Yellow River source area, and 25.2% of the total precipitation is contributed by this source. Around 4.2% of the total precipitation in the lake area is contributed by the evaporation from the Gyaring and Ngoring lakes.

These rocks were deposited on a high relief unconformity that developed on granite. Deposition within relief on the unconformity, possibly in the lee of a granite buttress, protected the rocks from erosion during subsequent overriding by the ice sheet. The succession reflects deposition in a glacial-fed to ice-contact lake that contained a freshwater crustacean fauna. Centimetre- to decimetre-scale basal layers include breccia and coarse-grained sandstone. The occurrence of breccia resting on weathered granite suggests sedimentation as scree and as mass flow deposits. Overlying decimetre-to metre-scale stratified diamictites interbedded with metre-scale, coarsening-upward successions of siltstone to cross-laminated sandstone suggest lacustrine deposition by suspension settling, rain out of ice-rafted debris, and deltaic progradation. Thin zones with abundant conchostracans and/or with prolific trace fossils, in addition to less common remains of other crustaceans, attest to the presence of a low diversity benthic fauna. Conchostracans are concentrated in a series of thin beds that reflect moderately lengthy, perhaps seasonal, periods of free-flowing water. Patchy vertical and lateral distribution of intense bioturbation and profuse trace fossils probably reflect repeated colonization events during times of favourable environmental conditions. Massive diamictite overlies the basal rocks and indicates that the ice-marginal lake was subsequently overridden by the late Palaeozoic ice sheet. Occurrences of lodgement till, glacitectonite and deformation till suggest deposition from temperate or warm-based ice, whereas underlying lacustrine and deltaic deposits, along with a crustacean and trace fossil fauna, suggest temperate periglacial conditions. Previous studies have stressed that upper Palaeozoic glacigenic deposits in Antarctica, and in Gondwanaland, record deglaciation events. In contrast, rocks at Mt. Butters provide an unusual glimpse into an ice-margin lake and its fauna just prior to ice sheet advance.

J	Lehmann, MF; Bernasconi, SM; McKenzie, JA				Lehmann, MF; Bernasconi, SM; McKenzie, JA			A method for the extraction of ammonium from freshwaters for nitrogen isotope analysis	ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												The measurement of delta (15)N values of inorganic nitrogen species is an important analytical tool to trace nitrogen species in order to understand nitrogen cycling in aquatic systems. Nitrogen isotope analysis of freshwater ammonium has, however, been hindered by the lack of a simple and reliable technique to measure delta (15)N values at natural abundance levels. We present a simple and rapid method to concentrate ammonium from freshwater samples for on-line N-isotope ratio determination. Ammonium is collected by adsorption on N-free cation exchange resins. The dried N-loaded exchange resin is then directly combusted to produce N(2) gas for subsequent delta (15)N analysis. The method was evaluated with simulated freshwater solutions containing varying amounts of standard NH(4)(+)-N (delta (15)N = 2.1 parts per thousand) and potentially interfering inorganic and organic compounds. In general, the cation exchange resin method gives accurate and reproducible delta (15)N values (sigma (1) < 0.3 parts per thousand; n = 10). Because of adsorption interference, high concentrations of cations in solution may cause ammonium loss but do not result in measurable isotope fractionation. Replicate extractions of the ammonium standard added to water collected from four Swiss lakes demonstrate the good performance of this method when applied to low ionic strength natural water samples with modest concentrations of dissolved organic nitrogen.

J	Inci, U				Inci, U			Lignite and carbonate deposition in Middle Lignite succession of the Soma Formation, Soma coalfield, western Turkey	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL GEOLOGY												The middle Miocete carbonate-dominated units that are called the Middle Lignite succession of the Soma Formation from the Soma coalfield of western Turkey were analyzed and two facies associations containing eight facies were determined from the detailed measured sections of the opencast lignite mines. The sedimentological, stratigraphical, and palaeobotanical data, and regional geology indicate alluvial and/or floodplain, shallow freshwater carbonate lakes, and lake margin environments, including forest mountain swamps in the intramontane basin which was developed on the collision-related basement rocks. The Middle Lignite succession displays cyclic depositional nature consisting of alternating fine-grained siliciclastic rock, lignite and freshwater carbonate rock. Some diagenetic features and algal laminations/structures in carbonate rocks, as well as paleosol relies and geological evidence of the lignite-forming paludal (swampy) conditions suggest alternating wet and dry periods in depositional system. The lignite deposition occurred in wetlands that formed during deposition of the Middle Lignite succession in alluvial plain and shallow carbonate lake-margins. The paleobotanical/palynological considerations, sedimentological features and depositional setting of the Middle Lignite succession indicate a seasonal, warm and semi-arid or dry climate for lignite deposition. The subsidence, sediment supply, seasonal climate, topography, and pre-Miocene carbonate basement may suggest main factors for lignite formation and preservation. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

The ratios of total dissolved Zn (10-40 nM) to dissolved Cu (7-20 nM) were [Zn]:[Cu] = 0.5-3 in samples taken at different seasons of a year; the ratios of the free aquo ion concentrations [Zn2+]:[Cu2+] were similar to 10(6). pCu was in the range of 14.5-15.9 and pZn 8.6-9.5 at different times and depths. The release of Zn from electrochemically inert complexes upon addition of Cu suggested direct competition of Cu and Zn for ligands in all lake-water samples examined. The selectivity of the natural ligands for Cu over Zn was evaluated as the conditional constant for the reaction Cu2+ + ZnL(1) = Zn2+ + CuL(1); K = (1.4 +/- 0.9) x 10(6) (average in the euphotic zone; pH 8). These highly selective ligands are probably of biological origin.																			0024-3590					SEP	1995	40	6					1142	1152		10.4319/lo.1995.40.6.1142	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1995.40.6.1142													WOS:A1995RY89500013

To characterize spatial patterns in juvenile lake sturgeon (<1000 mm TL) based on survey collections, 'hot spots' were identified through optimized hot spot analysis (HSA). This HSA was then interpolated by inverse distance weighted analysis to determine extent of identified 'hot spots' and 'cold spots'. Additionally, habitat variables (i.e., water depth, water velocity, and dominant substrate type) were investigated using a single season occupancy model to determine their influence on juvenile lake sturgeon occupancy probability. In total, 1203 juvenile lake sturgeon were captured across 4197 surveys. Three unique 'hot spots' were identified; western Lake Erie, Fighting Island in the Detroit River, and the North Channel in the St. Clair River. Interpolated 'hot spots' encompassed 73.1 km(2) in western Lake Erie, 4.7 km(2) near Fighting Island, and 6.6 km(2) in the North Channel. Detection probabilities within 'hot spots' ranged from 8.8%-43.4%. No habitat variables significantly predicted juvenile lake sturgeon occupancy. Juvenile lake sturgeon were captured in western Lake Erie where the water depth was >5.1 m and odds of occupancy increased with increased water velocity. Juvenile lake sturgeon in the Detroit and St. Clair River 'hot spots' were captured at sites with mean benthic water velocities ranging from 0.20-0.60 m/s and where water depth was >7.3 m. Irrespective of waterbody, 69% of all juveniles were detected over dominant sand and gravel substrates. These results provide valuable insight about juvenile habitat use that can help managers formulate effective conservation and restoration strategies supporting the continued recovery of Great Lakes lake sturgeon.

Our analysis is based on a 27-year record of the Daphnia population, SD, and the concentration of chlorophyll a (Chl-a), as well as shorter-term characterizations of minerogenic particle concentrations in the lake and application of an optical theory-based SD model previously tested for the lake. The first hypothesis is supported by (a) the consistency of seasonal patterns of Chl-a, SD, and Daphnia biomass, (b) the consistency of Daphnia biomass maxima with literature values associated with the CWP, (c) the positive relationships demonstrated between interannual differences in Daphnia biomass (and estimated grazing rates) and peak SD and duration of high clarity events, and (d) because during CWPs, estimated grazing rates exceed by a wide margin reasonable maximum values of phytoplankton growth rates. The second hypothesis is supported by (a) demonstration that the minerogenic particle sizes responsible for b(m) (and so its influence on SD) are within the size range subject to Daphnia grazing, and (b) application of the SD model, in the context of SD and Chl-a observations, showing that a reduction in b(m) is necessary to explain the high SD values observed during CWPs. Finally, a review of the growing literature on the contribution of b(m) to the overall particle scattering coefficient in various lakes suggests that minerogenic particles are often important to the SD signature of CWPs.

Hydrologic Landscape Classification to Estimate Bristol Bay, Alaska Watershed Hydrology	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Hydrologic landscapes (HLs) have proven to be a useful tool for broad scale assessment and classification of landscapes across the United States as they help organize larger geographical areas into areas of similar hydrologic characteristics. We developed a HL classification for the Bristol Bay watershed of southwest Alaska that incorporates indices of annual climate and seasonality, terrain, geology, and the influences of large lakes and glaciers. A HL classification is particularly useful in this large watershed because of its hydrologic and landscape variability, important salmon fishery, variety of environmental and potential anthropogenic stressors, and lack of widespread hydrologic data. Following creation of Bristol Bay basin-wide HL classes, we compared the HL distributions within watersheds grouped by two calculated runoff parameters derived from available long-term streamflow records and found HL distributions within these groups provided predictive insight on hydrologic behavior. Using these developed runoff groups, we estimated expected hydrologic behavior in watersheds across the larger Bristol Bay watershed that lacked gauged streamflow records. The HL approach provides a scientific basis for estimating the first-order hydrologic behavior of watersheds and landscapes that lack detailed hydrologic information.

In New York, where Tipula paludosa Meigen and Tipula oleracea L. (Diptera: Tipulidae) were first detected in 2004, baseline data on the extent of establishment is needed to monitor range expansion, make predictions about pest status, and guided management efforts. The incidence of both species was therefore addressed at two spatial scales to ascertain how widespread they were across the state and across sites of recent local establishment. Based on divergent natural history. T. oleracea was predicted to be more widespread both geographically and locally than T. paludosa. To delimit the current area of occurence surveys were conducted from 2004 to 2006. T. paludosa was detected in four countries and T. oleracea in 12 countries. In western New York. T. oleracea was established in more than a six-fold greater area than T. paludosa. T. oleracea was additionally detected on Long Island shown to be a geographically disjunet area of establishment. To measure local incidence, putting greens and tee boxes were scouted on golf courses. Contrary to predictions, 56-97 and 22.56% of those surfaces were already infested by T. paludosa and T. oleracea, respectively, within one or two seasons after initial detection. Because damage thresholds are relatively high, scouting for the insect, rather than its injury, will promote earlier detection. Given the impact of invasive Tipula across diverse turf habitats, continued range expansion will have serious repercussions for regional turfgrass management.																			0022-0493	1938-291X				APR	2009	102	2					652	658		10.1603/029.102.0225	http://dx.doi.org/10.1603/029.102.0225								19449646					WOS:000264899500026

Histopathological study of bream (Abramis brama) and asp (Aspius aspius) living in a PCB-polluted freshwater lake revealed abnormal cellular changes in the renal corpuscle of both species. Dilation of glomerular capillaries (DGC), mesangial edema (ME), an adhesion between visceral and parietal layers of Bowman's capsule (ABC), and filling of Bowman's space (FBS), were highly prevalent features in lake fish. The prevalence of each of these lesions was significantly lower, or totally absent in fish caught from reference locations. Cellular alterations in liver, gill, gonads, spleen, and intestine were all linked to seasonal changes. The results suggest that some of the observed histopathological changes in renal glomeruli, particularly DGC and ME, could possibly indicate a prolonged chemical stress caused by PCBs and related compounds. It is also possible that chronic PCB exposure may have suppressed and weakened the immune systems of exposed fish making them more vulnerable to secondary parasitic infections.																			0044-7447	1654-7209				MAY	2001	30	3					122	126		10.1639/0044-7447(2001)030[0122:HOFFFA]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1639/0044-7447(2001)030[0122:HOFFFA]2.0.CO;2								11436658					WOS:000169200200002

The marsh is a wetland on the Mediterranean coast of Spain with high spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Allozyme and morphometric analysis showed that Brachionus group plicatilis (formerly, Brachionus plicatilis and currently split into B. plicatilis and B. rotundiformis) was composed of three groups of genotypes with no evidence of gene flow between them (B. plicatilis, B. rotundiformis SM and B. rotundiformis SS). Correlations between seasonal and spatial distributions, on one hand, and temperature and salinity, on the other hand, were consistent with the results of experimental studies on population dynamics. Accordingly, B. plicatilis is a euryhaline, low temperature group; B. rotundiformis SM is adapted to high temperature and low salinity conditions; and B. rotundiformis SS is adapted to high temperature and high salinity conditions. The groups had different mictic responses to density, salinity and temperature, which can be explained to some extent as an adaptive escape response, given their different ecological preferences. These differences imply a partial ecological barrier to male-female encounter between groups. Mating experiments showed that most copulations occurred within a group. B. plicatilis has a mating recognition system different from those of either B. rotundiformis SM or SS, whereas the two B. rotundiformis groups had partially differentiated mating preferences. Cross-mating experiments performed in the laboratory failed to produce any detectable hybrids. We conclude that three sympatric sibling species inhabit Torreblanca Marsh. The remarkable association between genetic differences among clonal groups and their ecological preferences, mixis response and mating behavior is hypothesized to play a role in stabilizing sympatry, and gives insight into the evolution of genetic divergence and speciation in rotifers.

Elements Accumulation and Nutritive Value of Phragmites Australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steudel in Lake Burullus: A Ramsar site, Egypt	CATRINA-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES												The present study aims to assess the role of Phragmites australis in the accumulation of elements and nutritive value to test its suitability to use as a potential forage plant for cattle, goats and sheep in lake Burullus, Egypt. Different plant organs were collected from the sampling sites for estimating seven heavy metals (Mn, Pb, Co, Cu, Cd, Zn, and Fe) and six nutrients (Na, K, Ca, Mg, P and N) as well as the physical and chemical characteristics of water. In addition, seven organic constituents (total ash, carbohydrates, total lipids, crude fibers, crude protein, digestible crude protein and total digestible nutrients) were estimated, and three nutritive values (digestible energy, metabolized energy, net and gross energy) were calculated. The results revealed that an increase in heavy metals accumulation in the rhizome and decreased in the order of rhizome > stem > leaves. Moreover, positive linear relationships were found between these heavy metal concentrations in plant organs and those in water. Thus P. australis can serve as a good accumulator and bioindicator of heavy metals in the polluted water bodies. On the other hand, the nutrients are decreased in the order of stems > leaves > rhizomes. The leaves had the highest total ash, crude protein, digestible crude protein, digestible energy, metabolized energy and net energy, while the stems had the highest total carbohydrates and crude fibers. Therefore, the results revealed that the underground rhizomes had the ability to accumulate heavy metals and thereby used as a phytoremediator; while its aboveground parts had the highest nutrient and nutritive values, which consider the plant as good forage for animals.					; Al-Sodany, Yassin/AAJ-7411-2020; El-sheikh, Mohamed/AAO-4652-2020	The International Journal of Environmental Sciences, Catrina/0009-0004-0194-3219; 													1687-5052	2090-2786					2013	8	1					51	63																WOS:000450985300008
J	Amendas, G; McConnachie, G; Pournou, A				Amendas, George; McConnachie, Glenn; Pournou, Anastasia			Selective reburial: a potential approach for the in situ preservation of waterlogged archaeological wood in wetland excavations	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE												Excavations at Dispilio, a prehistoric lakeside settlement in northern Greece, have revealed a significant number of vertical wooden piles that need to be protected during and after excavation. Lifting of the piles is not possible and approaches such as reburial, cannot currently be implemented as excavation is still in progress. In 2005, several posts were "selectively buried" on an experimental basis, by encasing them in PVC pipes and backfilling with the surrounding sediment. This approach appeared to be capable of protecting the piles during excavation and be a potential solution for their post-excavation preservation. This preliminary study sets out to asses if this alternative approach to reburial could be an effective in situ preservation method. Fresh beech and pine samples were "selectively buried" similarly to the encased piles, and exposed to open excavation conditions. Retrieval of samples was undertaken every three months over a one year period and their condition was assessed by their physical properties, chemistry and biodeterioration. As no baseline data existed for the site, spot measurements of Eh, T, pH and water table were recorded every three months at three dipwells located inside the excavation trench. Physical properties of both buried and exposed pine and beech samples did not indicate considerable decay as longer exposure periods appear to be necessary to adequately reflect the effects of deterioration. However, assessment of micromorphology and chemistry showed some differences in the deterioration degree of the exposed samples compared to those buried in sediment. Monitoring results showed high seasonality in all environmental parameters throughout the 12 month monitoring period and indicated a hazardous environment for wood preservation. Preliminary results obtained showed that the "selective reburial" is directly dependant on overall site conditions. It reconstructs a similar microenvironment to the site burial environment and therefore can be effective for sites that favour wood preservation. In contrast to typical reburial, "selective reburial" can be applied during excavation without impeding its progress. However for environments like the one studied, this method is not recommended after excavation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Reproductive biology of Bagrus docmak in the Victoria Nile, Uganda	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												Aspects of the reproductive biology of Bagrus docmak in the Victoria Nile were investigated between November 2005 and October 2006. Macroscopic and histological analysis of the gonads confirmed it as an asynchronous batch spawner which spawns throughout the year with bimodal spawning peaks coinciding with rainfall seasons. The first spawning peak occurred from March to May, the second from September to November. The sex ratio did not significantly deviate from 1:1. Length at sexual maturity was 33.6 cm and 31.6 cm fork length (FL) for females and males, respectively. Batch fecundity ranged from 1 000 eggs in 34 cm FL fish to 43 000 eggs in 79 cm FL fish, and correlated linearly with FL (r=0.72) and body weight (r=0.79). Mean relative batch fecundity was 6 eggs g(-1) (SE 2). These results could guide research into the possibility of artificially inducing the fish to spawn, and its subsequent culture.

Natural variation in enzyme activity of the African cichlid Pseudocrenilabrus multicolor victoriae	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMISTRY & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY												This study describes the metabolic capacities of the African cichlid Pseudocrenilabrus multicolor victoriae from four sites in Uganda, East Africa. Fish were captured during the dry season, from two aquatic systems in different regions (Lake Nabugabo and Mpanga River). Within the Lake Nabugabo region, individuals were sampled from Lake Kayanja (normoxic) and Lwamunda Swamp (hypoxic): within the Mpanga River system, individuals were sampled from Bunoga and Kahunge (characterized by seasonal variation in dissolved oxygen (DO.)). Enzyme activity levels of pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, and cytochrome C oxidase were measured in four tissues: white skeletal muscle, heart, brain, and liver. Two additional enzymes were measured in the liver, malate dehydrogenase and fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase. Regional differences between enzyme activities in most tissues were evident; however, little variation was observed between two sites within a region despite differences in D.O. In general, P. multicolor from the Mpanga River system displayed greater anaerobic enzyme activity in white skeletal muscle, lower gluconeogenic enzyme activity in the liver, and an overall higher enzyme activity in the heart and brain tissues than fish from the Nabugabo region. The latter may reflect a long-term adaptation to low-oxygen conditions at the metapopulation level in the Nabugabo region. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Difficulties in assessing striped bass in reservoirs include their low density and the inability to distinguish species with hydroacoustic data alone. Despite these difficulties, mobile hydroacoustic surveys have potential to provide useful data for management because of the large sample volume compared to traditional methods such as gill netting and the ability to target specific areas where striped bass are aggregated. Hydroacoustic estimates of reservoir striped bass have been made using mobile surveys, with data analysis using a threshold for target strength in order to focus on striped bass-sized targets, and auxiliary sampling with nets to obtain species composition. We provide recommendations regarding survey design, based in part on simulations that provide insight on the level of effort that would be required to achieve reasonable estimates of abundance. Future surveys may be able to incorporate telemetry or other sonar techniques such as side-scan or multibeam in order to focus survey efforts on productive habitats (within lake and vertically). However, species apportionment will likely remain the main source of error, and we see no hydroacoustic system on the horizon that will identify fish by species at the spatial and temporal scale required for most reservoir surveys. In situations where species composition can be reliably assessed using traditional gears, abundance estimates from hydroacoustic methods should be useful to fishery managers interested in developing harvest regulations, assessing survival of stocked juveniles, identifying seasonal aggregations, and examining predator-prey balance.

MAIZE GRAIN YIELD RESPONSE TO THE DISTANCE NITROGEN IS PLACED AWAY FROM THE ROW	EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE												Correct placement of side dress nitrogen (N) fertilizer could increase nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and maize yield production. Field studies were established to evaluate application of midseason (V8 to V10), variable liquid urea ammonia nitrate (28%), N rates (0, 45, 90 and 134 kg N ha(-1)) and different application distances (0, 10, 20 and 30 cm) away from the maize row on grain yield and NUE at Haskell and Hennessey in 2009, Efaw in 2010 and Lake Carl Blackwell, Oklahoma in 2009 and 2010. A randomized complete block design with three replications was used throughout the study. Results indicated that maize grain yield in sites with adequate rainfall increased significantly (p < 0.05) with N rate, and poor N response was recorded in sites with low rainfall. Across sites and seasons, varying side dress N application distance away from the maize row did not significantly (p < 0.05) influence maize grain yield and NUE even with no prep-plant applied. Environments with adequate rainfall distribution had better maize grain yields when high side dress N rates (90 and 134 kg N ha(-1)) were applied 0 to 10 cm, and a higher NUE when 45 kg N ha(-1) was applied 0 to 20 cm away from the maize row. For low N rates (45 kg N ha(-1)), increased maize grain yield and NUE were achieved when side dress N was applied 0 to 20 cm away from the maize row at locations with low rainfall distribution. Across sites and seasons, increasing side dress N to 134 kg N ha(-1) contributed to a general decline in mean NUE to as low as 4%, 35%, 10%, 51% at Hennessey, Efaw, LCB (2009) and LCB (2010) respectively.

ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER ROTIFERA IN A SEASONAL POND OF THE UNIVERSITY OF PUNE (MAHARASHTRA, INDIA)	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The present work describes the occurrence and diversity of rotifers with respect to the physicochemical parameters in a seasonal pond of Pune (India) for a period of one year. The study reports 45 rotifers belonging to 3 orders, 15 families and 26 different genera. Of these, 1, 30 and 38 are new records to India, Maharashtra state and Pune district respectively. The pond water exhibits a typical range of temperature (20.7-30.5 degrees C) and alkaline nature (7.4-9.5), characteristic of tropical freshwater bodies. The rotifer fauna is characterised by moderate diversity and evenness, higher dominance, and very low temporal community similarities. The study also reveals dominance of eurythermal and eutrophic rotifer species. Rotifer richness is positively correlated to rainfall and temperature, whereas a negative correlation between pH and conductivity is observed. Rotifer abundance is positively correlated with pH, whereas no such correlation is observed with temperature and conductivity. Conservation of seasonal water bodies is essential, as these habitats may reveal interesting relationships between the physicochemical parameters and the rotifer fauna present there.					; Pai, Kalpana/JAO-4323-2023	Vanjare, Avinash/0000-0003-1936-9652; 													1589-1623	1785-0037					2013	11	4					525	539		10.15666/aeer/1104_525539	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/1104_525539													WOS:000329196300002
J	Yamamoto, Y; Shiah, FK				Yamamoto, Yoshimasa; Shiah, Fuh-Kwo			Potential importance of lagoons as breeding grounds for bluegill Lepomis macrochirus in Lake Biwa, Japan	LIMNOLOGY												Exotic bluegill Lepomis macrochirus have been propagating in the littoral region of Lake Biwa and its tributary lagoons. To investigate the reproductive activity of bluegill in the prespawning season, fish samples were collected from three sites at the littoral region of the lake and their nearby lagoons. The number of females relative to the total number of specimens tended to be higher in lagoons than in the adjacent littoral sites in the lake. The females collected from lagoons had significantly larger ovaries than those from the lake. The means of gonadal somatic index of females in the lake ranged from 1.77 to 3.44, whereas those in lagoons ranged from 4.35 to 12.2. The higher temperature conditions of lagoons appeared to be responsible for the higher maturation of ovaries of the fish in lagoons. The environmental condition of lagoons is potentially suitable for the active growth of larvae, subsequently increasing their overwintering success. Therefore, earlier spawning of bluegill in lagoons might have contributed to the propagation of bluegill in Lake Biwa to some extent.

J	Yokogawa, K				Yokogawa, Koji			Morphological variations in bluegill, Lepomis macrochirus, with particular emphasis on growth-related changes	ICHTHYOLOGICAL RESEARCH												Morphological variations in bluegill, Lepomis macrochirus, including growth-related changes, sexual dimorphism and morphological differences between populations in different habitats, were examined in samples from three reservoirs in Kagawa, Japan. Body measurements demonstrated frequent growth-related proportional changes, particularly in body depth, body width, caudal peduncle length and head length, which all showed relative increases, whereas first dorsal fin length, caudal fin length and orbital diameter became relatively shorter. Body weight increased relatively with growth, with relative growth coefficients of 3.339-3.454 for regressions between total length and body weight. Such body weight increases were likely due to the relative increases in body depth and width, and caudal peduncle depth. Although counts of fin spines, fin rays and gill rakers did not change with growth, those of scales tended to increase. Males were significantly larger than females in body depth, caudal peduncle length, head length and body weight. Sexual dimorphism was also apparent in body coloration during the breeding season. In addition, a number of morphological differences were observed between individuals from different habitats.

In the present investigation, a large shallow lake ecosystem was studied to determine the spatial and seasonal variation of the composition and concentration of humic substances. Concentrations of total dissolved organic matter, humic acid, and fulvic acid were found to display significant spatial distributions (1.3... 13.5 mg/L, DOM; 0.1... 5.4 mg/L, HA). The distribution is described by using mapping techniques and the analysis, of the spatial distribution of the lake. An analysis of the seasonal variations also indicated the dependence of the occurrence of these compounds on meteorological and hydrological conditions. To identify the potential sources of these organic materials, an analysis was made of the ratio of humic and fulvic acid fractions and total DOM. It was found that areas of high DOM concentration coincided with the areas of highest HA percentage of total DOM. Furthermore using the ratio of the normalised concentrations of HA, FA, and residual DOM (< 5000 g/mol) it was found that areas dominated by each are spatially distinct. This confirms the hypothesis that in these shallow lakes, photodegradation and bacterioplankton activity will create a residence time dependent zonation of each component of the total DOM.

The course of both rivers is interrupted by a series of reservoirs with quite different geographical, morphometric, climatic, hydrodynamic and chemical characteristics. The planktonic diatom Asterionella formosa Hassall, which has undesirable cyclic effects from the water management point of view, was studied in this complex of reservoirs located in the Mediterranean region. The results indicate that only the monomictic calcareous reservoirs show a bimodal pattern of Asterionella formosa abundance. The population dynamics of this algal species was found to depend on both the morphometric features and the hydraulic mode of management ( retention time) used at each reservoir, as well as on the physical ( temperature, suspended matter) and chemical ( nitrogen, silica, calcium) characteristics of the water.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUL	2003	501	1-3					45	58		10.1023/A:1026251101534	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1026251101534													WOS:000186041800006

Although emergency spillways have been constructed to prevent dam failures, overtopping and possible breaching may still occur due to excessive inflows in raining seasons. As a result, the downstream valleys will have serious inundation and the safety of people and properties will be in immediate danger. The purpose of this work is to simulate and to analyze the inundation potentials downstream of Tsao-Ling landslide lake using a hydrologic/hydraulic approach and GIS (Geographic Information System) technology. Hydrologic analysis is employed to describe regional rainfall-runoff characteristics and to design rainfall/runoff scenarios. One-dimensional dam break flood routings are performed with different return periods of rainfall events and dam failure durations for downstream creeks. The depletion hydrographs of dam break routings are applied into two-dimensional overland flow simulations for downstream lowlands. The results of hydraulic computations are evaluated with GIS maps for inundation potentials analysis, which can be used to assist the planning of emergency response measures.					; Li, Ming-Hsu/AAD-4938-2020; Hsu, Ming-Hsi/E-8153-2010	Li, Ming-Hsu/0000-0003-3383-6130; 													0921-030X					MAR	2002	25	3					289	303		10.1023/A:1014852711669	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1014852711669													WOS:000174582100005

Interpopulation variability for these mussels was relatively small in foot tissues because of the slow turnover time. Seasonal and spatial variations among the delta N-15 values of mussels might be due in part to the natural variation in delta N-15 values of potential food sources and the variation in the amount of human pollutions discharged into various locations of the lake. Although the increase of mussel delta N-15 values was accompanied by the increase of nutrient concentrations in most situations in this study, statistically significant correlations were only 22% of the total correlations in this survey, which might be attributed to the different time-scale variations in nutrient concentrations and isotope signatures and the unknown details of the trophic pathways and metabolism for incorporation of these nutrients.

Six tracking series were conducted between 1994 and 1995 to analyse the seasonal and diel movements of the fish. In each series, four to 12 roach were tagged externally and located every 2 h for up to 14 days using radiotelemetry. Roach were highly active, moving up to 10 km downstream to Lake Dameritzsee, and up to 6 km upstream from their release site. The fish, which mostly swam greater distances upstream during the day and downstream at night, were most active during the spawning season. Their habitat range varied greatly. Close-range habitat, based on 50% of all radiolocations, varied between 5 and 1350 m (mean. (X) over bar=296 m). Wide-range habitat, based on 90% of ail radiolocations. varied between 75 and 3820 m ((X) over bar=1006 m). The fish preferred different sections of water at different times of year, casting doubt on the relevance of the term home range. Generally; roach stayed close to the bank structures of the main channel during the day and moved to the stagnant waters at night. Consequently, they were most active at dawn and dusk.

Alternative future likely synthetic sequences can be numerically generated provided that the underlying generating mechanism of the lake level fluctuation phenomenon is identified. Simple linear and periodic nonlinear models are used for modeling the deterministic part in the lake level records. Linear trend is eliminated from the original lake level historic data by regression line technique. The nonlinear part needs two stages for its identification. First Fourier series is applied to model interannual periodicities in the lake level fluctuation series and then monthly standardization procedure is applied for seasonal periodic nonlinear component modeling. A second order Markov model is found suitable for the remaining stochastic parts. The application of the methodology is presented for the Lake Van monthly level data in eastern Turkey. Suitable models an identified and their parameters are estimated for trend, periodic and stochastic parts. Likely, synthetic lake levels are generated by the stochastic model and hence lake level extreme values are depicted for the next 2, 6, 12, 24, 60 and 120 months with risk calculations. Such risk calculations take into account the stochastic characteristics of the lake level fluctuations only. The deterministic parts as linear trends and periodicities are added to the stochastic extreme events for the actual simulation of the lake levels. The model presented in this paper is not for time prediction of future lake levels but rather for the simulation of possible equally likely extreme lake level value occurrences over any desired future period.

IMPROVED RRS AND TURBIDITY RETRIEVAL FROM OLI IMAGES IN COMPLEX INLAND WATERS: A CASE STUDY FOR LAGUNA DE BAY	XXIV ISPRS CONGRESS: IMAGING TODAY, FORESEEING TOMORROW, COMMISSION I	ISPRS Annals of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				24th ISPRS Congress on Imaging Today, Foreseeing Tomorrow	JUN 06-11, 2022	Nice, FRANCE	Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing				Spatiotemporal monitoring of water quality parameters such as turbidity in inland waters is desirable to better understand productivity and mitigate the negative impacts of pollution induced by increasing anthropogenic activities. However, precise retrieval of water quality parameters in complex turbid waters from the remote sensing reflectance R-rs remains a challenging task due to the varying optical complexity of the water body. In this study, a modified version of the Atmospheric Correction for OLI-lite (ModACO) scheme for turbid inland waters, which implements a linear extrapolation of MR aerosol reflectance in the visible bands instead of a nonlinear function, is presented. The performance of the proposed method and other existing algorithms such as the Atmospheric Correction for OLI-lite (ACOLITE), Management Unit of the Noth Seas Mathematical Models (MUMM) scheme, SeaDAS standard processing, and SWIRL were evaluated. The R-rs retrievals from these models were then used as input for turbidity estimation and mapping of Laguna de Bay. Results show lowest R-rs error in all five spectral bands (443, 482, 561, 655, and 865 nm) on ModACO-based retrievals. Relative to the ACOLITE and other atmospheric correction schemes, the proposed method reduced the R-rs retrieval errors in terms of RMSE and MAPE by more than 50% Similarly, significant improvements in turbidity retrievals were achieved from ModACO-based R-rs values, wherein comparable accuracy was observed from red/green ratio and the single MR band turbidity models. Turbidity maps of Laguna de Bay show elevated values from the mid of dry season, which may be associated with point source discharge and wind-induced resuspension of bottom sediments. The lake turbidity then drops by the end of dry season, which is linked to the absence of prevailing strong winds that may increase in-water mixing. Using the aforementioned method, accurate monitoring of turbidity can be done to determine and mitigate possible degradation on the water quality of Laguna de Bay and other productive turbid inland waters.																			2194-9042	2194-9050					2022	5-1						67	75		10.5194/isprs-annals-V-1-2022-67-2022	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/isprs-annals-V-1-2022-67-2022													WOS:000867698700008
J	Gang, X; Long, SX; Dang, AZ				Gang, Xiang; Long, Shengxing; Dang, Anzhi			Nutrients Affecting the Characteristics of Food-Web Structure in Aquatic Ecosystem of Pearl River	POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES												The water quality has degraded with economic development globally. However, the relationship between food-web structure and nitrogen and phosphorus is of rare concern. To study food chain in this ecosystem, we measured the concentrations of stable isotope value delta C-13 and delta N-15 in aquatic matter and organisms in Pearl River. The delta C-13 and delta N-15 concentrations ranged from -41.2% to -19.4% and from 0.81% to 25.4%, respectively. The delta C-13 concentrations in consumers were significantly higher than the particulate organic matter (POM), periphyton, phytoplankton, and higher aquatic plants. The delta C-13 of POM was likely derived from phytoplankton and exogenous organic detritus entering from a tributary, rather than from endogenous phytoplankton in the main river channel. The delta C-13 of phytoplankton was derived from eutrophic water with high nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations. Total delta C-13 was significantly higher in fish than in POM, phytoplankton, higher aquatic plants, and zooplankton, indicating that those components were the main carbon sources for fish. The carbon sources tended to be the same for different fish species in the same season at the same site, but different for a given fish species among seasons and sampling sites. This finding suggested that the feeding habits of different fish species converge as an adaptation to change environment. The food chain was longer (trophic level = 4.4) in river subsections with more carnivorous fish, such as Erythroculter pseudobrevicauda and Coilia grayii, and shorter in areas with more omnivorous fish. The total nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations in the water were negatively correlated with food- chain length (R-2 = 0.67, P<0.05; R-2 = 0.40, P<0.05). These results suggested that limiting nitrogen and phosphorus inputs into the water body would reduce the ecological risk in this area.																			1230-1485	2083-5906					2022	31	5					4641	4658		10.15244/pjoes/150387	http://dx.doi.org/10.15244/pjoes/150387													WOS:000888867900014

Excess nutrients of anthropogenic origin may be an essential factor that gives rise to these blooms. Goals: This work aimed to study an unusual bloom of the chlorophyte Chlamydomonas in an urban lake from a morphological and chemical approach. Methods: The study site was a small lake located in Cantera Oriente, Mexico City. Sampling was performed in February 2016 (the cold-dry season); environmental variables were measured in situ, and surface samples were obtained for organism abundance and chlorophyll-a concentration. An additional sample was freeze-dried for chemical analyses, and another sample was fixed in glutaraldehyde for ultrastructural studies by SEM, TEM, LM, and confocal microscopy, using the stain Nile red to detect the presence of intracellular lipids. Results: The results of morphological observations agreed with the characteristics of the description of C. reinhardtii. The bloom abundance values were high (6.98 x 10(5) +/- 1.37 x 10(5) cells mL(-1)), confirmed by the high values of chlorophyll-a concentration (5548 +/- 796 mu g L-1). The carbohydrate:protein ratio of the cells (0.15) indicates high protein synthesis during the enormous algal proliferation. The low lipid content (6.5 %) is associated with the absence of intracellular lipid granules and may be related to the availability of nitrogen and phosphorus and high vegetative multiplication. C. reinhardtii synthesizes essential fatty acids, such as alpha-linolenic acid (Omega 3), a precursor of beneficial lipids in human cardiovascular and neurological health. Conclusions: The bloom consisted mainly of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and it significantly correlated with the chlorophyll a concentration, indicating high photosynthetic capacity and active cell division. Linoleic acid (Omega 3), an important substance for human health, was present in the alga composition. A controlled culture of this alga could improve the Omega 3 concentration offering a biotechnological resource for the future.																			0188-8897					JAN-APR	2022	33	1					1	14																WOS:001024920900001

Lake Batlava is a lake built in the 1970s. This lake is located in the village of Batlava in the municipality of Podujeva. The supply of this lake with water is made from the Brvenica river. Monitoring was finished during the period from December 2020 to May 2021. The sample were taken in three championic places: at the entrance of the lake, in the middle and in the spill, on two levels, in the surface and at depth of 30 cm. The analyzed microbiological parameters are: total coliforms, fecal coliforms, fecal streptococci and aerobic mesophilic bacteria. The physical-chemical parameters are: dissolved oxygen, saturation with O-2, water temperature, pH value, electrical conductivity, total soluble matter, total suspended matter, turbidity, chemical demand for oxygen, biochemical demand for oxygen, total organic carbon, nitrate, total solidity of calcium, magnesium, ammonia ion, chloride, sulphates, fluurite, M-alkalines, bicarbonates and heavy metals, such as: Fe, Pb, Mn, Cu, Cd. The results showed that most physical-chemical and microbiological parameters are within the limit allowed by the WHO and EPA, except in some cases where during the precipitation season there have been several overruns and for this reason, it is recommended to take monthly monitoring of the water of Lake Batllava to achieve a real assessment.					; Paçarizi, Musaj/AAD-8320-2021	Pacarizi, Musaj/0000-0002-1097-6619; 													2299-8993						2022	23	9					231	240		10.12911/22998993/151906	http://dx.doi.org/10.12911/22998993/151906													WOS:001057853300007

As in this study, the surface area of Hamrin Lake was calculated from satellite images during the period from October 2019 to September 2020, with an average satellite image for each month, furthermore,by utilizing the Normalized Differences Water Index (NDWI), the largest surface area was 264,617 km2 for October and the lowest surface area 140.202 km(2) for September. The surface temperature of the lake water was also calculated from satellite images of the Landsat 8 satellite, based on bands 10 (Thermal Infrared 1) and 11 (Thermal Infrared 2) that are sensitive to thermal radiation, as the highest surface temperature reached in June 45.49 degrees C degrees Celsius due to the high temperatures for this month and the lowest in February 3.09 degrees C degrees Celsius, which is one of the months in which temperatures drop to the lowest level. The utilization of remote sensing and GIS innovations has helped a lot in checking changes, whether in surface area or temperature, which saves effort, time and cost. The results of this study put decision makers in taking the necessary precautions for the seasons of water scarcity and drought to meet the community's water needs in the areas of multiple human consumptions and at the same time take advantage of rainy seasons and water abundance to develop long-term strategic plans to maintain a sustainable water balance.					; Khalaf, Ahmed/JVD-7770-2023	Bahjat Khalaf, Ahmed/0000-0002-2506-4604; 													2078-8665	2411-7986					2022	19	5					1130	1139		10.21123/bsj.2022.6420	http://dx.doi.org/10.21123/bsj.2022.6420													WOS:000869189200014

Therefore, we infer that spatial patterns of zooplankton communities could be related to metacommunity concepts and their importance may depend on the size of the aquatic/terrestrial transition zone (ATTZ). Herein, we explored the relative importance of limnological (LIMNO) and FLOOD variables in zooplankton community by analyzing data from 272 sites across three floodplain lakes in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. Our results showed that the variation in the zooplankton community can be well explained by the LIMNO and FLOOD variables in all of the lakes under the low water level season. However, during the high water level season, neither LIMNO nor FLOOD can explain the spatial variances of zooplankton. Therefore, our results indicated that testing biogeographical theories and macroecological laws using zooplankton should consider temporal aspects of flood pulse. Furthermore, we noted that the number of explained variance by local variables is negatively correlated with the size of the ATTZ. Metacommunity concepts provide complementary insights in explaining zooplankton spatial patterns within large floodplain systems, which also provide a theoretical basis for ATTZ protection in floodplain management.

In this study, objectives have been made to evaluate the spatial and seasonal (dry and wet periods) variations of diffusive fluxes of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) in water-atmosphere interface and limnological variables (water and sediment) in densely urbanized wetland areas of a tropical reservoir located in the Sao Paulo metropolitan area. Three sampling stations (S1, S2, and S3) covering areas with different levels of aquatic pollution and land use were evaluated. Nonparametric analysis and one-way analysis of variance indicated the spatial and temporal influence of limnological variability on CH4 and CO2 fluxes. In general, S2 presented higher mean emissions for CH4 (0.31 g m(-2) day(-1)) and CO2 (60.9 g m(-2) day(-1)) compared with the other two stations in both sampling periods, in which maximum mean fluxes in S1 were 0.20 g m(-2) day(-1) and 18.3 g m(-2)day(-1), whereas in S3 the mean values were <0.09 g m(-2) day(-1) and 3.5 g m(-2) day(-1) for CH4 and CO2, respectively. These higher emissions in S2 are related to the proximity to point source discharge of raw sewage from a very urbanized area, as well as lower dilution capacity (water depth=0.4 m). S3 showed lower gases emissions, while S1 presented the intermediate gases flows due to the deepest water column (2.5 m) and higher capacity of pollutant dilution. Thus, we associate higher CH4 and CO2 emissions with the proximity of pollution discharges and lower dilution capacity. The results indicate higher emissions for shallow water, highlight the influence of disorderly occupation in urban areas, and clarify that adequate wastewater treatment is urgent to prevent wetland degradation and to minimize CH4 and CO2 emissions.

Invertebrates associated with the submersed Egeria najas and the floating rooted Pontederia azurea were chosen to provide a model involving different microhabitat complexity. The results suggest that vegetation structure provided by the two macrophyte species supported significant differences in the density of animals, with invertebrate abundance of E. najas twice as high as on P. azurea. Abundance showed no significant differences in both contrasting sampling dates, growth and decline. Our result clearly showed invertebrates exclusively associated with each macrophyte species, as well different invertebrate taxa dominating in each sampling date (decline: Cladocera; growth: Aphididae, Belostomatidae and Planorbidae). We also show that working at the taxonomic levels of family could be a sensible trade-off between taxonomic identification effort versus reaching reliable and useful results for environmental monitoring and natural resource management in highly diverse subtropical wetlands. Our results emphasize the role of vegetation structure on invertebrate communities, as well suggest that the growth cycle of macrophyte populations could be a relevant variable influencing these animals in pristine subtropical wetlands.					; Perez, Alejandra Patricia/NTQ-2898-2025	Franceschini, Celeste/0000-0002-2378-9820; Gallardo, Luciana/0000-0001-6410-9273; Perez, Alejandra Patricia/0000-0003-2334-4191; Sabater, Lara Milena/0000-0001-7102-9087; CORONEL, Juan Manuel/0000-0001-6667-2780													0001-3765	1678-2690					2022	94			4					e20210965	10.1590/0001-3765202220210965	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/0001-3765202220210965								36541975					WOS:000904536000001

Necessary measures should be taken to control environmental pollution by analyzing the conditions and parameters that cause pollution and monitoring the water quality in water bodies such as lakes, streams, rivers and ponds. Akkopru Stream is one of the rivers flowing into Lake Van and it has great importance within the borders of Van/Turkey. The data in this study were used to perform water quality analysis based on the physicochemical parameters obtained from Akkopru Stream. A total of 22 water quality parameters were used to determine water quality at the discharge into Lake Van. Evaluation of these parameters was made according to the regulation about water pollution control (Turkey). As a result, Akkopru Stream has Class I water quality in terms of seasonal conditions and water parameters. Among the parametric analysis methods, trend distribution, normality, correlation, matrix table, regression and normal distribution of the data set were examined and the relationships between parameters were interpreted statistically. According to the results, most of the parameters were within the normal range, solid matter and hardness effects were correlated, and matrix relations and regression equations were related to other parameters.					; Yetmen, Hursit/AAF-5663-2021; Hapoglu, Hale/KIE-3032-2024	Hapoglu, Hale/0000-0003-0464-9483; Yetmen, Hursit/0000-0003-4164-6951; 													1944-3994	1944-3986				JAN	2022	247						244	257		10.5004/dwt.2022.28047	http://dx.doi.org/10.5004/dwt.2022.28047													WOS:000762247600023

Meanwhile, the rapid increase of earth observation-based global surface water datasets provides valuable opportunities for evaluating inter-annual or seasonal surface water dynamics. This study investigated the potential of using long-term EO-based surface water products for regional drought monitoring. In particular, the dynamic of surface water over the middle reach of the Yangtze River from 1999 to 2020 was analyzed based on the GLAD product. Furthermore, we explored the linkage between surface water anomalies (i.e., Dynamic Water Index, DWI) and Standardized Precipitation Index (measured by SPI). The preliminary results showed that: (1) DWI was significantly coupled to 12-month SPI, which confirmed that dynamic surface water extent can be used as an indicator for hydrological drought; (2) The correlation between DWI and SPI (1-month, 3-month, 6-month, 12-month) in extreme wet climate was lower than in extreme drought climate; (3) It is challengeable to distinguish the difference in coupling strength between dynamic surface water and hydrological drought caused by DWI defined with different water types (i.e., all types versus seasonal water). Much more attention should be paid to evaluating the uncertainty of the new index caused by missing values across regions.

J	You, C; Wu, GJ; Wang, NL; Zhao, HB; Xu, C; Xia, CH				You, Chao; Wu, Guangjian; Wang, Ninglian; Zhao, Huabiao; Xu, Chao; Xia, Cuihui			Progress of levoglucosan records and vegetation fire changes in environmental media	CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE												Vegetation fire, also called biomass burning, wildfire, landscape fire, bushfire, forest fire, scrub fire, crop residue burning, peat bog fire, savanna fire and grass fire, are spontaneous combustion of plants in a natural setting. Vegetation fires began soon after the appearance of terrestrial plants in the Silurian about 420 million years ago. The regime of vegetation fire has varied with long-term changes in global climate and shorter-term regional changes in climate and vegetation since then, and human beings have altered fire activity since the mid-Holocene, especially in recent years. Vegetation fire affects vegetation distribution, ecological structure, biogeochemical and hydrologic cycles, geophysical processes, and the climate system at local to global scales. Vegetation fire is one of the largest sources of trace gases and aerosols in the Earth's atmosphere. It contributes more than half of black carbon and about 80% of primary organic aerosol worldwide. Besides, smoke aerosol from vegetation fire is composed of hundreds of chemical components, and many of which (e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) are known to be harmful to human health. Fire smoke causes more than 600000 premature deaths annually worldwide. Therefore, understanding the spatial-temporal changes of vegetation fire is of great importance. Using some specific biomarkers for tracing changes and emissions of vegetation fire has become a research focus in recent years. Among various chemical components, anhydro-sugars are mainly emitted by pyrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose when burning temperature exceeds 300 degrees C, whereas the contribution of fossil fuel emissions seems to be negligible. Levoglucosan accounts for more than 90% of anhydro-sugars in the nature. Levoglucosan has been reported with a lifetime longer than ten days under most atmospheric conditions, and thus could be transported far from the fire sources. The annual total levoglucosan emission is estimated at about 3.8 Tg (million ton) per year worldwide, however, when atmospheric degradation is considered, the atmospheric budget of levoglucosan is only about 1.9 Gg (kiloton) as calculated by the GEOS-Chem global 3-D chemical transport model. Eventually, levoglucosan is scavenged out the atmosphere to be deposited on earth surfaces by precipitation or gravitational processes. Its presence has been detected in various environmental medias including atmospheric aerosols, precipitation, lake/sea water, snowfall, glacier snow/ice, lake/ marine sediments. High levoglucosan concentration/flux is usually found in middle and low latitudes where intense fire sources are nearby. In comparison, extreme low concentration/flux are found on highmountains, polar regions and marine sites where levoglucosan can only arrive by long distance transportation. Levoglucosan has been widely used as a biomarker for tracing fire emissions ranging from event to glacial-inter glacial timescales. For example, levoglucosan has been detected in lake sediments older than 430 ka years before present under anoxic environmental conditions. This work summarized the recent progress of levoglucosan records and vegetation fire changes in various environmental media. Levoglucosan in atmospheric aerosols can reflect fire emissions from event to seasonal scales, and levoglucosan records in glacial ice and lake/marine sediments can reveal fire evolution from seasonal to glacial-interglacial timescales. Overall, the current knowledge supports that levoglucosan should be an ideal biomarker for tracing vegetation fire changes on Earth's surface. However, more evidences are needed in the near future to better understand its stability, interpret its records in ice core and sediments, as well as its relation with other proxies.					chaoqun, xu/AAX-8730-2021; You, Chao/AAD-7049-2022	Xu, Chao/0000-0003-1242-556X; You, Chao/0000-0001-7825-675X													0023-074X	2095-9419					2022	67	21					2522	2534		10.1360/TB-2021-1237	http://dx.doi.org/10.1360/TB-2021-1237													WOS:000836800300011

By 1996, G. fasciatus successfully colonized the littoral zone of Lake Ladoga and, via the Neva River, invaded the Neva Bay, the freshwater part of the Neva Estuary. In 1999, G. fasciatus was first registered in the inner Neva Estuary, the very first record of the Baikalian amphipod in brackish waters of the Baltic Sea. Distribution, abundance, reproduction and population structure of G.,fasciatus in the Neva Estuary were studied during 1998-2000. In some locations of the Neva Estuary, maximum densities of G. fasciatus reached 3500 ind. m(-2). In general, density and biomass of G. fasciatus in the freshwater part of the Neva Estuary were higher (around 1.5 fold) than in the brackish-water part. Fecundity of this amphipod averaged 10-20 eggs per female, depending on body size of females and season. In order to assess the possibility of further spread of G.,fasciatus in the Baltic Sea, the salinity tolerance of this species was determined in a series of laboratory experiments. Our results showed that the invasive amphipod G. fasciatus is potentially able to colonize shallow coastal habitats of, for example, the Gulf of Bothnia, Gulf of Riga and other parts of the Baltic Sea with water salinities ranging from 1 to 5 psu.					; Panov, Vadim/E-3927-2016; Berezina, Nadezhda/R-1968-2016	Berezina, Nadezhda/0000-0003-3057-5596; Panov, Vadim/0009-0003-0738-0800; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB 15	2004	514	1-3					199	206		10.1023/B:hydr.0000018219.28645.3a	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:hydr.0000018219.28645.3a													WOS:000220784400019
J	Hughes, GB; Giegengack, R; Kritikos, HN				Hughes, GB; Giegengack, R; Kritikos, HN			Modern spectral climate patterns in rhythmically deposited argillites of the Gowganda Formation (Early Proterozoic), southern Ontario, Canada	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												Rhythmically deposited argillites of the Gowganda Formation (ca. 2.0-2.5 Ga) probably formed in a glacial setting. Drop stones and layered sedimentary couplets in the rock presumably indicate formation in a lacustrine environment with repeating freeze-thaw cycles. It is plausible that temporal variations in the thickness of sedimentary layers are related to interannual climatic variability, e.g. average seasonal temperature could have influenced melting and the amount of sediment source material carried to the lake. A sequence of layer couplet thickness measurements was made from high-resolution digitized photographs taken at an outcrop in southern Ontario, Canada. The frequency spectrum of thickness measurements displays patterns that resemble some aspects of modern climate. Coherent periodic modes in the thickness spectrum appear at 9.9-10.7 layer couplets and at 14.3 layer couplets. It is unlikely that these coherent modes result from random processes. Modern instrument records of regional temperature and rainfall display similar spectral patterns, with some datasets showing significant modes near 14 yr in both parameters. Rainfall and temperature could have affected sedimentary layering in the Gowganda argillite sequence, and climate modulation of couplet thickness emerges as the most likely explanation of the observed layering pattern. If this interpretation is correct, the layer couplets represent predominantly annual accumulations of sediment (i.e. they are varves), and the thickness spectrum provides a glimpse of Early Proterozoic climatic variability.

This study investigated the structure and morphological characteristics of crustal landforms in a modern playa located in the West Juyan Lake, western Inner Mongolia of China, through an integrated analysis of high-resolution remote sensing images obtained from Google Earth, pedestrian field surveys, and unmanned aerial vehicle photography. The study area covers approximately 2,650 ha and the number of salt crust patches was 3,491. Across this area, the coverage and number of salt crust patches varied with elevation and sedimentary environment. The results show that the polygonal patch pattern of the salt crust landforms was fractal, and similar polygonal patch perimeter to area ratios and landscape index values prevail in the study area. The wind erosion of material on the surface of the Gobi Desert, a mountain torrent alluvial fan, and material carried by seasonal river water probably provided the provenance of the regional salt crust landforms. The structure and morphological characteristics of salt crust in typical playas of the arid and semiarid region are important for better understanding their composition and sedimentary environment. This study can help reveal relevant information regarding environmental change and provide a reference for saline dust emissions from playas in arid areas.

J	Koschorreck, M				Koschorreck, M			Nitrogen turnover in drying sediments of an Amazon floodplain lake	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												In the Amazon floodplain large areas are subject to annual cycles of drying and rewetting. The turnover of nitrogen in the periodically drying sediments is an important regulator of floodplain fertility. In the present study the transition of a lake sediment from flooded to dry conditions was studied with respect to microbial nitrogen turnover. Soil nitrogen pools, as well as the activity and abundance of denitrifying and nitrifying bacteria, were investigated during one dry season. During the first weeks after drying, most of the inorganic nitrogen vanished from the sediment. The process was inhibited by a nitrification inhibitor, showing that coupled nitrification-denitrification was responsible for the nitrogen loss. Assimilation by plants or microbes, as well as leaching, were not important mechanisms of nitrogen loss. During a period of only 10 days, 59% of the total denitrification and 94% of the total N2O emission during the dry period occurred. Cell numbers of denitrifiers were not correlated with activities. Denitrification was not correlated with other sediment variables but was regulated by the patchy distribution of reduced and oxidized zones in the uppermost centimeters of the sediment. This heterogeneity was probably introduced by the bioturbation of small insects, which was restricted to a rather short time period shortly after drying.

To study nutrient limitation of bacteria and to determine the sources supporting nutrient-limited bacterial growth, 5 nutrient deletion/dilution experiments were carried out in Laguna Bufeos. We carried out 3 experiments during 3 consecutive low-water seasons and 2 experiments during 1 high-water season. No evidence of N or P limitation was observed during the 2 experiments in the high-water season. Conversely, bacteria were limited by P in the 3 experiments in the low-water season. Limitation by N occurred only in one of the low-water experiments. Nutrient-limited bacterial growth rates equaled 37 to 86% of nutrient-saturated growth rates. Nutrients recycled by microzooplankton, mainly heterotrophic nanoflagellates and oligotrich ciliates, were the major nutrient source supporting P- or N-limited growth. Our results suggest a strong control of bacterial growth rates by P in Amazonian white-water lakes during the low-water season, while this limitation is alleviated during the high-water season, probably through supply of new nutrients from the river. The strong nutrient limitation of bacteria and the dependence of bacteria on nutrients supplied by their predators can be expected to slow down the decomposition of organic matter in Amazonian floodplain lakes. This may partly explain why these ecosystems are often rich in organic matter.					; De Meester, Luc/F-3832-2015	Rejas, Danny/0000-0003-2561-1214; Muylaert, Koenraad/0000-0001-9645-4063; De Meester, Luc/0000-0001-5433-6843													0948-3055	1616-1564				APR 28	2005	39	1					57	67		10.3354/ame039057	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame039057													WOS:000229259900006

The average catch per fisherman was 22 kg day(-1). There were significant differences between subsistence and commercial fishing, and also across different seasons of the year. Catch was higher in the dry season and in the lake environment, followed by the river environment. The flooded forest was exploited in the rainy season. Out of a total of more than 70 fish species, 10 taxa comprised 75% of the catch. The catch in the Monte Alegre region concentrated on smaller species for local consumption. Prochilodus nigricans (Spix & Agassiz) was the most important species, followed by Liposarcus pardalis (Castelnau) and Plagioscion spp. Comparisons between quantities of fish consumed and fish marketed indicated that the fishery has a much more important role in the region than previously thought.

In the Andes, bofedales, a specific type of peat-producing wetland, are essential for the sustainability of mountain ecosystems and indigenous pastoralist communities. The Chucuyo bofedal in northern Chile is affected by climatic variability and water extraction for agricultural uses via the Lauca canal. Herders in the local community also actively manage this wetland according to their traditional ecological knowledge to ensure permanent fodder for their animals. In this article, we analyze the annual behavior of the Chucuyo bofedal after the wet season. Based on precipitation data, extracted water flows, vegetation vigor from satellite images, and an ethnographic approach, we determined that the bofedal's productivity was negatively correlated with the amount of precipitation and positively correlated with the surface area of the wetland. However, water extraction via the Lauca channel had no significant relationship with either surface area or vegetation vigor. We identify community practices and traditional ecological knowledge as key elements in the maintenance of these ecosystems. This situation is critical in the context of an aging population and the current pattern of migration out of the region to urban areas. The results provide substantial empirical evidence for future decision-making regarding the conservation of these ecosystems.

The heart of the submersible voltammetric probe is a gel-integrated microsensor including either a single or an array microelectrode. The integration of a microelectrode in a gel is a novelty which protects its surface from fouling and allows its application for direct measurements in complex media. The main features of this kind of microsensors for in situ measurements in natural waters are discussed. Reliability and validity of concentration profiles obtained using the VIP System have been demonstrated by comparing in situ and on-field voltammetric data with those obtained using classical techniques. The advantages of combining the VIP System with classical techniques for environmental study are also illustrated. In particular, (i) specific measurements of the mobile forms (i.e., hydrated Mn2+ and small complexes with size smaller than a few nanometers), the colloidal forms (a few nanometers to 1 mu m) and the particulate forms (>1 mu m), which are three key fractions for understanding Mn biogeochemical cycles as well as (ii) the discrimination between seasonal and temporal variations can be performed with minimum sample handling and analysis time.																			0013-936X	1520-5851				MAY 15	1998	32	10					1515	1521		10.1021/es9706108	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es9706108													WOS:000073648700023

JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY												We investigated the ability of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) to colonize small streams (<30 m wide), which have been considered to have low susceptibility to invasion. We examined European literature concerning riverine mussel populations and sampled lake and stream sites in the St. Joseph River basin (Indiana-Michigan, USA) for mussels. The presence of colonized upstream lakes (rather than stream size) was the critical watershed feature determining zebra mussel invasion of streams because such lakes served as a source of veligers that drifted into outflowing streams. For all sites, there was a significant positive association (p < 0.001) between zebra mussel presence in lakes and in their outflowing streams. Two streams in the St. Joseph River basin (average widths: 20 m and 7 m) had mussel densities that declined exponentially from >1000/m(2) at the lake outlet to about 10/m(2) within 1 km downstream of the colonized take, although isolated mussels were found up to 12 km downstream. This pattern persisted for 3 y (1993-1995) with no substantial change in mussel distribution or abundance. Stream populations appear not to be self-sustaining, but rather they rely on an upstream source of larvae. Our findings suggest that zebra mussel distributions in flowing water ecosystems are best described by a source-sink model, wherein streams (''sinks'') are the recipient for larval mussels produced in lakes (''sources'').

However, the area is undergoing serious problems such as high deforestation rates, soil erosion and over exploitation and extinction of species. These factors have all contributed to the current loss of biodiversity. Also, biological inventories are still incomplete. One of the least explored sites is the semiarid zone of Tehuantepec isthmus, around the locality of Santa Maria del Mar, Oaxaca, Mexico. The area includes floodable grasslands, mangrove areas and dry forest, providing a range of potential habitats for different species. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of temporal lakes on spatial and temporal composition of the avifauna in Santa Maria del Mar, in order to generate information regarding this group within the region and the state, and to understand the importance of flood areas for resident and transitory birds. We conducted 12 avifauna surveys between July 2006 and June 2008, and established two transects of 2km length in each of four habitat types (beach, grassland, dry forest, and mangrove). We found a total of 75 species, corresponding to 16 orders and 30 families Within an area of 26km(2), we significantly found 10.1% of the total number of bird species recorded for the entire state, and 6.6% of the total reported in Mexico. The families most represented were: Ardeidae, Laridae and Scolopacidae. Over the entire study period, dry forest was the most diverse habitat; followed by mangrove, grassland and the beach. Of all the species recorded, 38.6% were found at the edge or in the temporal lakes. We found a significant difference in species composition between seasons in the grassland, but no difference in the other habitats. Our results showed a significant effect of temporary lakes on avian diversity during the wet season; it also demonstrated the importance of grassland conservation given its relevance for presence of waterbirds. We suggested a continued and more intense monitoring; and proposed the designation of the area as an Important Conservation Bird Area (AICA).					; Carrillo-Reyes, Arturo/F-6267-2010	Carrillo-Reyes, Arturo/0000-0001-8351-5496; Rioja-Paradela, Tamara/0000-0003-2127-0790														2215-2075				DEC	2014	62	4					1523	1533		10.15517/rbt.v62i4.12994	http://dx.doi.org/10.15517/rbt.v62i4.12994								25720185					WOS:000347141900021
J	Stockner, JG; Macisaac, EA				Stockner, JG; Macisaac, EA			British Columbia lake enrichment programme: Two decades of habitat enhancement for sockeye salmon	REGULATED RIVERS-RESEARCH & MANAGEMENT					International Workshop on Remedial Strategies in Regulated Rivers	SEP 25-28, 1995	LYCKSELE, SWEDEN	Swedish Environm Protect Agcy				The anadromous sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus neuka) is the most valuable salmonid species on the Pacific coast of North America. Juvenile sockeye rear for 1-2 years in lakes, where they feed primarily on crustacean zooplankton. As a result of overfishing and habitat loss for over a century, most British Columbia nursery lakes are now recruitment limited, with too few adult salmon returning to spawn and provide fry. However, declining adult escapements have also resulted in a significant loss of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) nutrients supplied by decomposing adult carcasses and the lakes have become less productive (oligotrophication) for rearing sockeye fry. To reverse this process and increase sockeye salmon abundance, in 1976 the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans began enriching nursery lakes with nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients to increase their productivity and fry-rearing capacity. Many of the objectives, techniques and results from the Lake Enrichment Programme are also applicable to the management of regulated watersheds where mitigation for possible long-term reductions in freshwater habitat productivity is a concern. Over the last two decades, 20 lakes were fertilized weekly through the growing season with liquid fertilizers. The lakes have received limnological and fisheries assessments that have focused on pelagic food-webs and production processes. The lakes have shown a positive response at all trophic levels to nutrient additions, with an increase in activity and doubling of bacteria abundance, increases of 50-60% in autotrophic picoplankton abundance and phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll) and up to twofold increases in primary production and zooplankton biomass. This enhanced lake production has increased growth and survival of juvenile sockeye and increased smelt weights (> 60%) resulting in larger sockeye adult returns worth 10-20 million dollars per year to the Canadian economy. The benefit:cost ratio of lake fertilization is the best of currently available salmonid enhancement techniques.																			0886-9375					JUL-OCT	1996	12	4-5					547	561																WOS:A1996VK75500017

Bacterial production data for these lakes had not been recorded until now. The present study had as working hypothesis that bacterial production may contribute significantly to carbon fixation, particularly in lakes rich in organic matter and that this production varies diurnal and seasonally thus altering BP/PP ratios. In order to test this hypothesis the study had as objective to estimate phytoplankton and bacterioplankton production rates along with the concentrations of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in two periods of the day (morning and afternoon) and in two seasons (dry and rainy), in four lakes, being two lakes within the Rio Doce State Park and two at its surroundings. Among the selected lakes, Lake Amarela showed the highest nutrient concentrations and highest bacterial production. The results allow to conclude that despite exhibiting lower values when compared with the ones recorded for phytoplankton production, bacterioplankton production is essential to the general metabolism of the lakes, particularly for those rich in organic matter and exhibiting oligo-mesotrophic conditions.					; Barbosa, Francisco/M-6225-2019; Petrucio, Mauricio/AAC-6232-2019	Barbosa, Francisco Antonio/0000-0002-2026-6936; Petrucio, Mauricio/0000-0002-7242-9426													0018-8158					FEB 1	2004	513	1-3					71	76		10.1023/B:hydr.0000018167.43745.33	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:hydr.0000018167.43745.33													WOS:000220784200007

Nutrient assays were performed to determine if the same nutrients that limit phytoplankton also limit periphyton growth in the lake. Nutrient diffusing clay substrates containing agar spiked with nitrogen, phosphorus, or both, along with nutrient-free controls, were incubated at four sites in the lake. Three sites were located in a pelagic-littoral interface (ecotone) and one site was located in the interior littoral region. Incubations lasted for 20-26 days, and were repeated on a quarterly basis between 1996 and 1997, to incorporate seasonal variability into the experimental design. The physical and chemical conditions at each site also were measured. Periphyton biomass (chlorophyll a and ash-free dry mass) was highest at the littoral and northern ecotone sites. At the littoral site, nitrogen limited biomass in four of five incubations, although the largest biomass differences between the treatments and controls (less than or equal to3 mug cm(-2) as chl) were probably not ecologically significant. Periphyton biomass at the western and southern ecotone sites was low compared to the other two sites. Increases in water column depth and associated declines in light penetration strongly correlated with periphyton growth and suggested that they may have limited growth most often at all three ecotone sites. Nitrogen also was found to limit periphyton growth approximately 20% of the time at the ecotone sites and phosphorus was found to limit growth once at the west site.					; east, t/KVY-8260-2024; Steinman, Alan/B-8723-2014	Steinman, Alan/0000-0002-4886-4305; 													0018-8158					APR	2001	448	1-3					27	39		10.1023/A:1017529432448	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017529432448													WOS:000169863400005

Effects of parents and Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) on nest predation risk for a songbird	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Nest predation limits avian fitness, so ornithologists study nest predation, but they often only document patterns of predation rates without substantively investigating underlying mechanisms. Parental behavior and predator ecology are two fundamental drivers of predation rates and patterns, but the role of parents is less certain, particularly for songbirds. Previous work reproduced microhabitat-predation patterns experienced by Yellow Warblers (Setophaga petechia) in the Mono Lake basin at experimental nests without parents, suggesting that these patterns were driven by predator ecology rather than predator interactions with parents. In this study, we further explored effects of post-initiation parental behavior (nest defense and attendance) on predation risk by comparing natural versus experimental patterns related to territory density, seasonal timing of nest initiation, and nest age. Rates of parasitism by Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) were high in this system (49% nests parasitized), so we also examined parasitism-predation relationships. Natural nest predation rates (NPR) correlated negatively with breeding territory density and nonlinearly (U-shaped relationship) with nest-initiation timing, but experimental nests recorded no such patterns. After adjusting natural-nest data to control for these differences from experimental nests other than the presence of parents (e. g., defining nest failure similarly and excluding nestling-period data), we obtained similar results. Thus, parents were necessary to produce observed patterns. Lower natural NPR compared with experimental NPR suggested that parents reduced predation rates via nest defense, so this parental behavior or its consequences were likely correlated with density or seasonal timing. In contrast, daily predation rates decreased with nest age for both nest types, indicating this pattern did not involve parents. Parasitized nests suffered higher rates of partial predation but lower rates of complete predation, suggesting direct predation by cowbirds. Explicit behavioral research on parents, predators (including cowbirds), and their interactions would further illuminate mechanisms underlying the density, seasonal, and nest age patterns we observed.

J	Rooney, AA; Bermudez, DS; Guillette, LJ Jr				Rooney, AA; Bermudez, DS; Guillette, LJ Jr			Altered histology of the thymus and spleen in contaminant-exposed juvenile American alligators	JOURNAL OF MORPHOLOGY												Morphological differences in spleen and thymus are closely related to functional immune differences. Hormonal regulation of the immune system has been demonstrated in reptilian splenic and thymic tissue. Spleens and thymus were obtained from juvenile alligators at two reference sites in Florida, USA: Orange Lake and a National Wildlife Refuge, Lake Woodruff, as well as from a contaminated lake, Lake Apopka. Lake Apopka has been extensively polluted with agricultural pesticides. Tissues were prepared for histological analysis to determine if previously detected endocrine abnormalities associated with contaminant exposure might also be reflected in morphological differences in splenic and thymic structures important for immunological response. Similar tissues were taken from captive-raised juvenile female alligators (3 years old) that were hatched from eggs collected on Lake Woodruff and Lake Apopka. Differences in thymic ratios (medulla/cortex) were found among alligators collected from the two lakes (P = 0.0051). Alligators from Lake Apopka had smaller thymic ratios than animals from either reference lake. Males from Lake Woodruff had significantly smaller lymphocyte sheaths in the spleen than females (P = 0.0009), indicative of a normal sexual dimorphism. Lymphocyte sheath width differed among females obtained from the three lakes, with females from Lake Apopka having the smallest sheath width and those from Orange Lake having the largest. Malpighian body area was largest in alligators from Orange Lake, intermediate in Lake Woodruff, and smallest in Lake Apopka. In contrast to that observed for wild-caught animals, no difference was found in the thymic medulla/cortex ratio of captive-raised female alligators (P = 0.378). Captive-raised female alligators from Lake Apopka and Lake Woodruff displayed lake-associated differences in lymphocyte sheath width as observed in wild animals; Lake Apopka alligators had smaller lymphocyte sheath width compared to Woodruff alligators (P = 0.0396). In contrast to wild-caught animals, area of the Malpighian bodies did not differ by lake in the captive-raised female alligators (P = 0.066). The enlarged thymic cortex suggests a change in T-lymphocyte maturation within the thymus of alligators from a contaminated environment, Lake Apopka. The results point to alterations in the histology of the thymus and spleen. Further studies are required to examine the functional significance of these observations.					; Rooney, Andrew/AAX-3728-2021	Rooney, Andrew/0000-0002-1756-5185; 													0362-2525	1097-4687				JUN	2003	256	3					349	359		10.1002/jmor.10090	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jmor.10090								12655616					WOS:000182902300009
J	Lamoureux, SF				Lamoureux, SF			Catchment and lake controls over the formation of varves in monomictic Nicolay Lake, Cornwall Island, Nunavut	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												On the basis of thin-section sedimentology, Cs-137 and Pb-210 profiles, and the pronounced seasonality of runoff and sediment delivery, sediments from Nicolay Lake, Cornwall Island, Nunavut (77 46'N, 94 40'W) are interpreted as varves. In thin section, the laminae are conformable, normally graded units of silt and clay. Depending on the location in the lake, the varves frequently contain one or more subannual rhythmites and inclusions of coarse sand and silt grains. Given the unstratified nature of the lake, the rhythmites are interpreted as products of sediment inflow events derived from rainfall, snowmelt, or mass wasting processes. In the most proximal site, these rhythmites may reflect insolation-driven diurnal variations in sediment transport. Isolated coarse grains in the varves are interpreted as eolian sediments washed off the lake ice cover. The lake is currently isothermal, and persistent ice cover and cold inflow prevent the formation of thermal stratification. The high accumulation rate is a critical factor in varve formation and it is probable that increased sediment yield during the past 500 years has led to the formation of varves, compared to the underlying massive mud that accumulated when deposition was focused inland of the lake during higher relative sea level. Evidence in the catchment indicates that high-elevation deglacial deposits have acted as an important fine-grained sediment source throughout the Holocene. These sediments moved progressively downstream through a series of basins by successive degradation and aggradation controlled by glacioisostatic emergence, hence, limiting the progression of this paraglacial sediment wave to areas upstream of the lake until the late Holocene. These results identify the importance of shifting catchment boundary conditions on sediment yield throughout the Holocene, and also indicate the difficulty of interpreting low-frequency yield variations as the direct consequence of changing climate in similar varve records.																			0008-4077	1480-3313				SEP	1999	36	9					1533	1546		10.1139/e99-040	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/e99-040													WOS:000084257500009
J	Gómez, LS; Fuentes, OE				Sequeira Gomez, L.; Escolero Fuentes, O.			The application of electrical methods in exploration for ground water resources in the River Malacatoya sub-basin, Nicaragua	GEOFISICA INTERNACIONAL												Nicaragua is being substantially affected by climate change, whose impact is to be seen in marked seasonal variations of climatic and hydrometric parameters. Rainfall has declined sharply over the last decade within a strip of land that runs parallel to the Pacific Ocean and extends from the extreme northwest of Lake Nicaragua (also known as Cocibolca) to the Departments of Madriz and Nueva Segovia and beyond the border with Honduras. Droughts and water shortages have changed the way of life of local inhabitants along the strip, which includes the Malacatoya sub-basin. Shallow aquifers and surface water levels have been notably reduced. This has increased the need to seek new water sources in the sub-basin from a flow-systems viewpoint, applying hydro-geological, geophysical and hydro-geochemical techniques to create a conceptual model of how the systems operate. This article describes the application of 10 Continuous Vertical Electrical Soundings (CVES) and nine Vertical Electrical Soundings (VES), accompanied by a geological evaluation. Taken together, these techniques permit the identification and characterization - in terms of space and depth - of the aquifer formations present in three sub-areas of the sub-basin. Geophysical results indicate that the thickest aquifers were to be encountered in the Rio Malacatoya and Las Banderas quaternary units (unconfined aquifers). In these units, the flow is through porous media. In Teustepe, in the Rio Grande de Matagalpa, Cerro Oluma, La Libertad and Santa Lucia tertiary units, the flow is through fractured media (semi-confined aquifers).

The evaporative component of the model considers the catchment to be composed of one of three surface types-forest, agricultural land or water surface. Values of the model parameters for the forest and agricultural lands were obtained from experimental studies carried out in the dry zone of India. Estimates of average monthly potential evaporation, together with measurements of monthly rainfall, were used in the model to predict the monthly levels of Lake Malawi. These were compared with observed levels. From 1896 to 1967 the major fluctuations in lake level, both seasonally and annually, are well described by this model (excepting the period from 1935 to 1945, immediately following the time when there was no outflow from the lake) using a value of 64% for the forest coverage of the catchment. The overall agreement between prediction and observation indicates that variations in rainfall alone, without changes in either evaporative demand or in the hydraulic regime of the lake, are sufficient to explain lake level changes. For the more recent period (1954-1994), model predictions of lake level which take into account a decrease in forest cover of 13% over the period 1967-1990 (consistent with the actual decrease in forest cover for this period) agree well with observations both annually and seasonally. Without this decrease in forest cover, the model predicted that the lake level would have been about 1 m lower than that observed during the southern African drought of 1992. The model, in conjunction with real-time rainfall data obtained from land-based gauges, radar or satellite observations, can be used for real-time water resource management applications such as the operation of barrages regulating the flow from Lake Malawi or for the issuing of flood or drought warnings.																			0022-1694					AUG	1995	170	1-4					123	135		10.1016/0022-1694(94)02679-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-1694(94)02679-6													WOS:A1995RH48000009
J	Odegaard, C; Rea, DK; Moore, TC				Odegaard, C; Rea, DK; Moore, TC			Stratigraphy of the mid-Holocene black bands in Lakes Michigan and Huron: Evidence for possible basin-wide anoxia	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												The post- glacial history of the Great Lakes has involved several changes in lake levels throughout the latest Pleistocene and Holocene, resulting from the changing position of the retreating Laurentide ice sheet, outlet incision and isostatic rebound. The final lowering of lake levels occurred at approximately 7600 C-14 yr BP, after which lake levels began to rise again to the Nipissing highstand at approximately 4700 C-14 yr BP. During this time of rising lake levels, black bands of iron sulfide were being formed in the sediments of all five of the Great Lakes. These bands signify suboxic to anoxic conditions, at least within the sediments and possibly at the sediment- water interface, during the middle Holocene warm interval. During this interval, the climate was warmer and drier than present, possibly resulting in the occasional absence of seasonal turnover in the lakes. We examined a series of piston cores from northern Lakes Michigan and Huron and found that the black bands are correlatable among cores taken from within the same basin. The observation that the banding can be correlated suggests a basin- wide cause, near- bottom or sub- bottom anoxia in the northern Michigan and northern Huron sediments during the mid- Holocene warm period. The sedimentary and geochemical processes in the Great Lakes during the middle Holocene warm interval are good indicators of possible future scenarios for the lakes as a result of global warming, as 21(st) - century temperatures are predicted to reach similar levels due to increased concentrations of greenhouse gases.

J	Markovic, S; Armenio, V				Markovic, Sara; Armenio, Vincenzo			Laboratory-scale investigation of a periodically forced stratified basin with inclined endwalls	JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS												We present results of numerical simulations of a stratified reservoir with a three-layer stratification, subject to an oscillating surface shear stress. We investigate the effect of sloped endwalls on mixing and internal wave adjustment to forcing within the basin, for three different periods of forcing. The simulations are carried out at a laboratory scale, using large-eddy simulation. We solve the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations under the Boussinesq approximation using a second-order-accurate finite-volume solver. The model was validated by reproducing experimental results for the response of a reservoir to surface shear stress and resonant frequencies of internal waves. We find interesting combinations of wave modes and mixing under variation of the forcing frequencies and of the inclination of the endwalls. When the frequency of the forcing is close to the fundamental mode-one wave frequency, a resonant internal seiche occurs and the response is characterized by the first vertical mode. For forcing periods twice and three times the fundamental period, the dominant response is in terms of the second vertical mode. Adjustment to forcing via the second vertical mode is accompanied by the cancellation of the fundamental wave and energy transfer to higher-frequency waves. The study shows that the slope of the endwalls dramatically affects the location of mixing, which has a feedback on the wave field by promoting the generation of higher vertical modes.						armenio, vincenzo/0000-0002-2945-9152													0022-1120	1469-7645				DEC 2	2021	932								A13	10.1017/jfm.2021.991	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2021.991													WOS:000725018200001

P movement in soil was investigated by using the KH2 (PO4)-P-32 tracker method, and the amount of P leached from the soil layer in different depths was estimated by measuring P concentrations in the soil solution and saturated hydraulic conductivities in field. Determination was done about one month after P application. There was 46% and 42% of total P-32 retained in the 0 - 5cm layer of soil in the Yixing site and in the Changshu site respectively. The P-32 retained in the 25 - 30 cm layer was only about 1 - 2% of the total P-32 added. Furthermore, 8.01% of P-32 in the soil of Yixing site and 16.8% of P-32 in the soil of Changshu site was lost from the layer 0 - 30 cm soil. The seasonal amounts of P leached from the top soil layer and from bottom layer are about 4.5 - 5.8% and 1.6 - 2.1% of the total P application, respectively. Changes of total P concentrations in soil solutions during rice growth showed that the fertilizer P applied before flooding of the paddy fields suffered a flash leaching loss and a slow leaching loss. We concluded that the fertilizer P could quickly move in the flooded paddy rice field and parts of it can enter into surface water and ground water. Unless the P application is well managed the risk of P loss and consequently environmental pollution exist.

Assessment of Suspended Sediment Budget of the Lena River Delta Based on the Remote Sensing Dataset	IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS												This study evaluates long-term and seasonal changes of sediment budget in Lena delta based on remote sensing dataset. Since 2000 Landsat images have been applying during ice-free period, from June to September. The sediment concentration at the delta topset was compared with sediment concentrations data at the outlets of: the Main, the Olenekskaya, the Tumatskyaya, the Trofimovskaya and the Bykovskaya channels to calculate suspended sediment budget in delta. The sediment concentration was calculated based on the archive Landsat images (more than 30 images). We have estimated influence of air temperature on thermal coastal erosion and the accumulation of sediments in the river Lena's delta. The increase of the daily average air temperature from 5 degrees C to 14 degrees C plays critical role in the degradation of permafrost and the activation of the processes of thermal erosion and thermal denudation of the right channels coasts and this fact means that these results can help to estimate special aspects of biochemical budget of the delta.

Waterfowl use of mine tailing ponds in comparison with beaver ponds in boreal eastern Canada	AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY												Wetlands are essential for many animal and plant species. However, many of these ecosystems are being degraded. Wetland degradation affects the habitat of certain groups of species such as waterfowl, which use these environments at different stages of their life cycle. In this study, we assessed the quality of man-made wetlands, i.e., mine tailing ponds, in comparison to beaver ponds, which are natural wetlands used by waterfowl. We conducted repeated surveys of breeding waterfowl species present on 12 mining ponds and 38 beaver ponds in boreal western Quebec, Canada. We also conducted brood surveys and considered environmental variables at the sites that could affect their occupancy. Conditions at the mining ponds appear to be as favorable for the establishment of breeding waterfowl as those observed in beaver ponds. Using site occupancy models, we found that five out of the six species studied were as likely to occupy and breed in mining ponds as in beaver ponds: Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), Ring-necked Duck (Aythya collaris), American Wigeon (Mareca americana), Green-winged Teal (Anas crecca), and Hooded Merganser (Lophodytes cucullatus). Both adults and broods of Common Goldeneye (Bucephala clangula) were more likely to use mining ponds than beaver ponds, but we did not find a direct relationship between goldeneye occupancy and environmental variables at our sites. Overall, the results of our study suggest that mining ponds have the potential to be managed for waterfowl and used by this group during the breeding season. However, further studies are required to assess the long-term effects of mining ponds on wildlife, particularly regarding contaminants such as heavy metals likely present at such sites.					; Imbeau, Louis/A-6642-2009	Imbeau, Louis/0000-0003-4111-8059; Mazerolle, Marc/0000-0002-0486-0310													1712-6568					DEC	2021	16	2							24	10.5751/ACE-02003-160224	http://dx.doi.org/10.5751/ACE-02003-160224													WOS:000739877700028

The Baikal Amphipod Gmelinoides fasciatus (Amphipoda, Crustacea) in the Diet of Perch in the Littoral Zone of Lake Onega (Age and Seasonal Characteristics)	BIOLOGY BULLETIN												This paper focuses on the role of the invasive amphipod Gmelinoides fasciatus in the food web of Lake Onega, the northern range limit of the amphipod in the European part of Russia. Its significance as food is evaluated for the European perch Perca fluviatilis (L.) a populous fish species which is most common in the littoral zone of the lake. This invader is established to have become dominant in the diet of perch throughout the year. Its occurrence in the perch diet when the fish is 1-3+ years old averages about 80%, decreasing at older fish ages and being replaced by other representatives of the benthos, as well as by young fish. As to biomass, the role of the invader in the feeding of young perch (1-7+ years old) averages 50% (up to 79%, for 1-2+ years old) during the year. The percentage of invaders in the perch diet is decreased down to 3-10% with distance off the shore (at depths of more than 1.5 m). The introduction of G. fasciatus to Lake Onega is regarded to be positive, as it has increased the potential productivity of fishing in the lake.

J	Hu, X; Xue, L; Bürgmann, R; Fu, YN				Hu, Xie; Xue, Liang; Burgmann, Roland; Fu, Yuning			Stress Perturbations From Hydrological and Industrial Loads and Seismicity in the Salt Lake City Region	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH												The interconnection between anthropogenic and natural surface loads and seismicity continues to be poorly understood. The metropolitan Salt Lake City in Utah hosts various industrial, hydrological, and tectonic processes, including the Bingham Canyon mine and its associated tailings facility, precipitation and water storage at the surface and in aquifers, as well as the seismically active Wasatch Fault Zone. The March 18, 2020 M5.7 Magna earthquake occurred east of a mine tailings impoundment that receives similar to 60 million tons/yr of ore waste products since the early 1900s. Here we investigate the spatiotemporal elastic stress changes due to anthropogenic mass transfer and natural hydrological loading and unloading. Two local earthquake clusters host persistent microseismicity and the 2020 M5.7 Magna earthquake sequence. The amplitude and sign of the computed Coulomb stress changes at seismogenic depths strongly vary with the receiver fault geometry, the frictional coefficient, and the location, and can reach tens of kPa and similar to 1 kPa/yr due to the tailings loads, a substantial fraction of background tectonic loading. The long-term and seasonal stress changes from regional hydrological processes are only up to a few kPa. A lack of statistically significant seasonality in seismicity across Utah suggests a weak control by cyclic hydrological loads. Explicit knowledge of the fault architecture is essential to allow for seismic hazard assessment considering external stress loading. Plain Language Summary The anthropogenic surface modifications in naturally hazardous environments have received relatively little attention due to their small dimensions and shallow locations. We note a compelling spatial correlation between a mine tailings impoundment and the March 18, 2020 M5.7 Magna earthquake, its aftershocks, and persistent earthquake clusters in the Salt Lake City region. This highly populated region hosts various industrial, hydrological, and tectonic processes. Here we characterize the spatiotemporal stress changes since the early 1900s due to the industrial and hydrological sources. The modeled elastic stress changes in the three dimensional subsurface vary in sign and magnitude, depending on the location, geometry, and frictional properties of active faults. Comprehensive characterization of fault architecture and seismic monitoring near sites of industrial production is warranted in critical geological and tectonic settings to ensure socioeconomic health and sustainable development.					; Burgmann, Roland/AAE-5138-2022	Fu, Yuning/0000-0002-9226-3857; Hu, Xie/0000-0002-6744-7291; Xue, Liang/0000-0002-7071-1057; Burgmann, Roland/0000-0002-3560-044X													2169-9313	2169-9356				DEC	2021	126	12							e2021JB022362	10.1029/2021JB022362	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021JB022362													WOS:000751383000030

Cloacal temperatures of 739 caimans of different sizes captured between 1830 hrs and 2200 hrs were measured with a digital thermometer between August 1996 and September 1999 in the same area. The masses of caimans monitored ranged from 3 to 42 kg, and caiman size affected the amplitude of body temperatures. Small caimans generally had lower mean body temperatures than larger caimans only at the beginning of the night in the cool season before body temperatures equilibrated with water temperatures. Mean body temperature was 25.7 degrees C in the cool season and 30.1 degrees C in the warm season, with a minimum of 16.9 degrees C and a maximum of 37.9 degrees C. In the warm season, caimans spent more time in shady areas, on land or in the water, than exposed directly to sunlight, and body temperatures only slightly exceeded water temperatures. In the cool season, caimans basked in the sun, both on land and in water, and caimans on land achieved body temperatures up to 15 degrees C above water temperatures, but body temperatures of caimans on land rarely exceeded air temperatures during daylight hours. Gravid females did not have higher temperatures than females that were not gravid. The caimans appeared to vary from near thermoconformity in the warm season to active thermoregulation when water temperatures were less than about 28 degrees C. However, caimans often appeared to give low priority to thermoregulation, and much shuttling behavior may occur for reasons unrelated to thermoregulation.

J	Prasad, MBK; Ramanatran, AL				Prasad, MBK; Ramanatran, AL			Solute sources and processes in the Achankovil River basin, Western Ghats, southern India	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL												A time series survey was carried out in 2002 to understand the hydrogeochemical processes taking place in the Achankovil River of the Western Ghats Range. The water is neutral with pH and EC ranges from 6.32 to 7.56 and 24-54 mu S cm(-1), respectively. Chloride and sodium are the dominant anion and cation in the water respectively. Correlation analysis of the chemical parameters of the water shows that few ions have additional sources. The majority of carbonate is derived from carbonate weathering followed by silicate weathering. Cation concentrations show decreasing trend from upstream to downstream in contrast to the increasing trend in the major world rivers. Dissolved silica in pre-monsoon water is low. The river chemistry is dominated by rock weathering induced by precipitation. Thermodynamic plots show that dolomite, kaolinite, albite and chlorite are in equilibrium with the river water. Chemical weathering is predominant here compared to physical weathering. The overall material transport seems to be lower compared to the other Indian rivers; nevertheless, the solute loads are comparable to certain large rivers such as the River Cauvery in southern India. The solute flux including the nutrient flux is very high among the Western Ghats rivers in relation to its size, which will certainly supplement the productivity of the lake/estuary and the coastal waters. Since this study is restricted to a one-year period, long-term data procurement and analysis along with micro nutrients studies are needed, which are lacking in the present study, to gain insight into the material flux by this river into the Arabian Sea.					; AL, Ramanathan/E-7217-2012	AL, Ramanathan/0000-0002-3491-2273; 													0262-6667	2150-3435				APR	2005	50	2					341	354		10.1623/hysj.50.2.341.60653	http://dx.doi.org/10.1623/hysj.50.2.341.60653													WOS:000228434400010
J	Ovidio, M; Philippart, JC; Baras, E				Ovidio, M; Philippart, JC; Baras, E			Methodological bias in home range and mobility estimates when locating radio-tagged trout, Salmo trutta, at different time intervals	AQUATIC LIVING RESOURCES												Radio tracking has been extensively used to enhance our knowledge on the movement and home range of fish in general and salmonids in particular. However, the use of various temporal sampling protocols is likely to overlook fish movements, and produce experimental artefacts, the amplitude of which is unknown and may compromise comparison of fish behaviours revealed by different protocols. Starting from a day-by-day tracking study of brown treat in Belgian waters (Aisne stream, nine fish, minimum 39 daily locations per fish), we re-examined their home range and mobility, through a subsampling process, as if the fish had been located at longer time intervals (2-14 days). The estimates from subsamples were compared to the original data set in order to quantify the corresponding reduction of accuracy from observed data, and how far this could be predicted on the basis of locating frequency. The results clearly indicate that all intervals longer than one day generally generate substantial biases (reduction of accuracy from 0 to 82% for home range and from 5 to 92% for mobility) but these can be partly corrected through the use of predictive models. This analysis demonstrates that any comparison between studies relying on different locating frequencies can generate some ambiguity when interpreting biological phenomena or geographical differences.

A combination of bottom-up and top-down eutrophication control measures has been implemented in both lakes since 1979. Dividing time-series data from 1976 to 1993 into three distinctive management periods has facilitated a comparative analysis of the two lakes regarding both the seasonal and long-term dynamics in response to eutrophication control. Results of the study have demonstrated that non-supervised ANN are an alternative technique: (1) to elucidate causal relationships of complex ecological processes, and (2) to reveal long-term behaviours of ecosystems in response to different management approaches. It has been shown that external nutrient control combined with food web manipulation have turned both lakes from nitrogen to phosphorus limitation, and from blue-green algae to diatom and green algae dominance.

HYDROBIOLOGIA					International Conference on Trophic Cascades in Shallow Freshwater and Brackish Lakes	AUG 20-25, 1995	WARSAW, POLAND	Inst Ecol, Polish Acad Sci, Univ Warsaw, Polish Hydrobiol Soc				Sediment cores were collected from two of the Norfolk Broads and two of the West Midland Meres, to test the hypothesis that rooted macrophytes increase the sediment release rate of phosphorus during the growing season. These were taken from inside and outside plant beds (mixed Myriophyllum spicatum and Chara sp. in Hickling Broad and Nuphar lutea in Burntfen Broad, Mere Mere and Little Mere). The overlying water was replaced with a standard water designed to mimic lowland freshwater. After an overnight 'batch' incubation the water was analysed for TP and SRP. From this their release rates were calculated. Interstitial measurements of SRP were also made for some of the Broads cores at the end of the incubation period. The data were analysed using General Linear Models. TP and SRP were the responses for both data sets. Factors for the Broads were inside/outside plant beds, date, and site, whilst for the Meres the factors of date and site could not be delineated. Release rates in this study were affected by a number of factors (plants, site and date).

However the large variability between replicates highlights the logistical difficulties in running such experiments.																			0018-8158					JAN 17	1997	342						27	34		10.1023/A:1017019713123	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017019713123													WOS:A1997WZ13900004

In this study, vertical profiles of water temperature, dissolved oxygen, electric conductivity, turbidity, and chlorophyll a were measured in 2014, 2015, 2017, and 2018 in two Sumatran deep lakes, Lakes Maninjau and Singkarak. In Lake Maninjau, intensive surveys on the profiles were also conducted in three different seasons in 2018. The comparison of the profiles between 2015 and 2017 indicated the events of large convection down to the lake bottoms happened in both of the lakes. Similarly, small convection down to around 30 m depth was found in the period between May and Jul, 2018. Air temperature drops up to five degrees centigrade were observed in these periods, confirmed by the changes in lake surface temperature estimated by MODIS imagery for the lakes. The magnitudes of the convective events were discussed with the observed amounts of heat loss and the estimated heat transfer through lake surface. Furthermore, the influences of such events on anoxic hypolimnetic waters were evaluated and considered from the view of climate change.					; Matsushita, Bunkei/E-1036-2014; Setiawan, Fajar/AAV-7115-2021; Subehi, Luki/W-4045-2019; Dianto, Aan/JJC-9457-2023; Fukushima, Takehiko/S-9801-2019	Fakhrudin, Muh./0000-0003-0751-9983; Fukushima, Takehiko/0000-0003-2494-309X; 													1439-8621	1439-863X				APR	2022	23	2					375	383		10.1007/s10201-021-00686-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-021-00686-8		NOV 2021											WOS:000722782900001

J	Humphries, M; McCarthy, T				Humphries, Marc; McCarthy, Terence			Chemical sedimentation as a driver of habitat diversity in dryland wetlands	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Freshwater wetlands located in dryland environments are characterised by high evapotranspiration rates and frequent periods of desiccation, which strongly influence the water chemistry and solute budgets of these systems. The transpiration of groundwater, especially by trees, is an important mechanism through which dryland wetlands can lose water. This process can lead to groundwater salinization and the precipitation of substantial quantities of minerals within the soil, the accumulation of which can have profound consequences for wetland structure and function. This paper aims to bring together current knowledge on the processes that result in solute accumulation and chemical sedimentation which assist in maintaining freshwater conditions in many seasonal dryland wetlands. Examples from central and southern Africa, Australia and South America are presented to illustrate the geomorphically diverse settings under which chemical sedimentation can occur, and the importance of these processes for the resilience and longevity of dryland wetlands. We show that the localised development of saline groundwater and subsurface precipitation of minerals within soils can play a key role in creating and maintaining the habitat diversity of dryland wetlands. Wetland vegetation localises the accumulation of deleterious constituents, thereby preventing widespread salinization and playa-lake formation, and thus ensuring that the bulk of the surface water remains fresh. Although such processes remain widely understudied, we suggest that chemical sedimentation could be a common phenomenon in many dryland wetlands and have important implications for the future management of these ecosystems.

Here, we address the issue of spatial and temporal variations in DOM quantity and quality in a deep tropical lake (Brazil). We measure DOC, Chl-a, suspended solids, nutrients and CDOM metrics in surface water samples taken from 21 sampling sites during six campaigns, and we quantify their links with water depth and rainfall estimates. Temporal effects explain between 74.5 and 94.5% of the variance in DOC, SUVA(254), a(CDOM440), and Chl-a, and all those parameters were influenced by rainfall. In contrast, spatial variations affect more S275-295 and a(CDOM254). The contributing drainage area varies spatially in morphology and geometry, and each portion affects a specific part of the lake, resulting in a spatial variation in DOM quantity and quality. Our findings demonstrate the importance of the input of allochthonous DOM (which depends on seasonal rainfall and drainage area shape) to DOM dynamics in a tropical lake. The study area is receiving lower rates of precipitation in recent times, and our results suggest that this may alter the seasonal patterns of input of DOM and nutrients in the lake, with possible impacts on water quality, aquatic biota and ecosystem functioning.

J	Feibel, CS				Feibel, CS			Tephrostratigraphy and geological context in paleoanthropology	EVOLUTIONARY ANTHROPOLOGY												The fossiliferous and artifact-rich sites of East Africa, which are central to our understanding of early hominid evolution, also preserve a detailed record of explosive volcanism. The products of these eruptions, ash, lapilli, and pumice, are collectively known as tephra. They drifted down from the skies or washed down rivers in later rainy seasons, and now provide a key to both dating and correlation, and with them the establishment of a geologic framework for evolution. While some tephra can be directly dated, particularly through mineral phases they contain, the glass component of most ashes has a geochemical fingerprint that is unique to a particular eruption. That fingerprint defines an isochronous marker, a layer in time. By identifying characteristic geochemical signatures from far-flung localities, geologists can correlate sequences, establish relationships in time, and compile longterm records from local sections. Much of our understanding of the pattern and timing of Plio-Pleistocene evolution in East Africa is based on this tephrostratigraphic framework.																			1060-1538						1999	8	3					87	100																WOS:000082297300004
J	Henderson, PA; Crampton, WGR				Henderson, PA; Crampton, WGR			A comparison of fish diversity and abundance between nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor lakes in the Upper Amazon	JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY												A comparative study was undertaken of Amazonian fish diversity and density (abundance and biomass) in nutrient poor (blackwater) and richer (whitewater varzea) habitats in the vicinity of Tefe, Brazil. The whitewater sampling sites, in the floodplain of the Rios Solimoes and Japura, had high turbidity (Secchi disc 0.03-0.7 m), a conductivity of 64-110 mu S cm(-1) at 25 degrees C and a pH of 6.6-6.9. The blackwater sites Lagos Amana, Iama and Tefe had a low turbidity (Secchi disc 2.0-2.2 m), a conductivity of 7-11 mu S cm(-1) at 25 degrees C and a pH of 5.3-6.0. The fish communities of open water, floating meadow and forest margin were sampled. Both whitewater and blackwater sites held high diversity fish communities with many species in common. Whitewater habitats were more diverse yielding 108 species, compared with only 68 from blackwater. Fish density within floating meadow was estimated during high water April and May 1994, and low water October 1994 and March 1995. During the high water season fish biomasses in blackwater lakes (31.1 g m(-2)) were significantly greater than those of either whitewater lakes (13.4 g m(-2)) or whitewater river channels (3.45 g m(-2)). At low water, in October, whitewater channels were generally found to hold the highest fish biomass (204 g m(-2)) although in March a blackwater site yielded the highest fish biomass recorded (285.9 g m(-2)). The amount of floating meadow habitat within whitewaters is however much greater than that in blackwaters. It is suggested that blackwaters may offer a stable habitat resulting in a high standing crop. In comparison, variation in conditions such as dissolved oxygen concentration in the whitewater may limit standing crop, but still allow periods of high productivity. Evidence was found for migration of fish from varzea lakes during periods of low oxygen availability. The high diversity and biomass of fish caught in both whitewater and blackwater lakes indicates that water acidity and conductivity are poor predictors of fish diversity and density in tropical floodplain lakes.

Timing of management practices requires an understanding of pest population dynamics in given cropping systems. Our study was designed to establish the population trends of B. invadens in mango orchards and to determine if population fluctuations were reflected in fruit infestation levels during changes in mango phenology. Materials and methods. Bactrocera invadens flies were trapped weekly from February 2011 to November 2012, using methyl eugenol and DDVP (dichlorvos) insecticidal strips. Trapping was done in three mango orchards in the Luweero district of Uganda's Lake Victoria Crescent. Mango fruit samples were incubated for the retrieval of puparia to calculate positivity (proportion of fruits infested) and fruit infestation indices (number of puparia per kg of fruit) for each stage of fruit maturity. Results. Mean trap catches of adult B. invadens varied significantly over the months (range : similar to 11 flies per trap per day (FTD) to over 590 FTD; P <= 0.0001). During each year, infestations peaked during June-July and January-February. Trap catches were higher in the major fruiting season compared with the minor fruiting season and were the highest when mango was at the physiological maturity and ripe stages. Fruit infestation and positivity were highest for fruit at the physiological maturity and ripe stages and lowest at the fruit set stage. Discussion. Our findings show that B. invadens is present year-round and all stages of mango fruit development are susceptible to attack. Thus, control measures should be implemented throughout the year and preferably started at fruit set to lessen fruit fly population build-up and damage to fruits.																			0248-1294	1625-967X				NOV	2014	69	6					473	480		10.1051/fruits/2014033	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/fruits/2014033													WOS:000344622100005
J	Burns, KC				Burns, KC			Broad-scale reciprocity in an avian seed dispersal mutualism	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim Coevolved relationships between individual species of birds and plants rarely occur in seed dispersal mutualisms. This study evaluates whether reciprocal relationships may occur between assemblages of bird and plant species. Location Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada (48degrees 50' - N, 125degrees 22' -W). Methods The distribution and fruiting phenologies of seven shrub species were compared to seasonal changes in habitat selection and seed dispersal by six fruit-eating bird species. Results Shrub species inhabiting forest understorey habitat had earlier fruiting phenologies than shrub species inhabiting forest edge habitat along lake and bog margins. Birds showed a parallel pattern in habitat selection, being more abundant in the forest understorey early in the fruiting season, and more abundant in the forest edge later in the season. Rates of seed deposition covaried with avian habitat selection, in such a way that birds directed seed dispersal into habitats preferred by shrubs. Conclusions These results depict a broad-scale pattern in the abundance of birds and fruits indicative of reciprocal interactions. Seasonal changes in seed dispersal to each habitat appear to reinforce the relationship between shrub habitat affinities and fruiting phenologies. Phenological differences between habitats may also reinforce seasonal changes in avian habitat selection. Therefore, although reciprocal interactions between pairs of bird and plant species are rare, broad-scale reciprocal relationships may occur between assemblages of bird and plant species.

The aim of this study was to assess how different top-down control in lakes containing a single fish population of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and naturally fishless lakes affects the characteristics and structure of littoral macroinvertebrate communities throughout the ice-free season. Nektonic and zoobenthic communities were examined through univariate community characteristics [abundance, species density, species richness (D), evenness (J'), diversity, H')] and multivariate species assemblages. The total abundance of nektonic and zoobenthic communities and their univariate diversity indices were similar between fish-present and fishless lakes over the entire sampling period. However, species assemblages for both types of macroinvertebrate communities were significantly different between fish-present and fishless lakes throughout the season. Typically, the same invertebrate species occurred in the two lake types; but their relative abundance was different. The results of our study show that the top-down control in fish-present and fishless lakes leads to different littoral community structures, which were not perceptible through the studied univariate community characteristics. This study highlights the importance of selecting appropriate indicators for the assessment of invertebrate communities in lakes of the eastern Canadian Boreal Shield.

The QWASI fugacity/aquivalence multispecies model was applied to examine Hg dynamics through a steady-state analysis of high loading conditions. The analysis indicated that the Carson River supplies most Hg in the water and upper sediments, with minimal inputs from the atmosphere and the Truckee Canal. Model estimates suggest that more than 90% of Hg entering the system from the Carson River at high flow is retained in the sediment of the reservoir, with export removing the remainder. Losses due to volatilization are negligible. The amount of methylmercury (MeHg) in the reservoir can be accounted for by inputs from the Carson River with minimal methylation occurring in the reservoir. The lack of species conversion and high retention rate appear to be due to the unreactive mineralogy of particulate Hg. Thus, we suggest that Hg dynamics are similar to that of other highly particle-reactive metals where fate is determined by particle movement. Finally, model results suggest an additional source of Hg to the system, which we hypothesize is from deep contaminated sediment that enters the system through sediment mixing caused by seasonal wet and dry cycles and sediment resuspension.

Night sampling improves indices used for management of yellow perch in Lake Erie	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												P>Catch rate (catch per hour) was examined for age-0 and age-1 yellow perch, Perca flavescens (Mitchill), captured in bottom trawls from 1991 to 2005 in western Lake Erie: (1) to examine variation of catch rate among years, seasons, diel periods and their interactions; and (2) to determine whether sampling during particular diel periods improved the management value of CPH data used in models to project abundance of age-2 yellow perch. Catch rate varied with year, season and the diel period during which sampling was conducted as well as by the interaction between year and season. Indices of abundance of age-0 and age-1 yellow perch estimated from night samples typically produced better fitting models and lower estimates of age-2 abundance than those using morning or afternoon samples, whereas indices using afternoon samples typically produced less precise and higher estimates of abundance. The diel period during which sampling is conducted will not affect observed population trends but may affect estimates of abundance of age-0 and age-1 yellow perch, which in turn affect recommended allowable harvest. A field experiment throughout western Lake Erie is recommended to examine potential benefits of night sampling to management of yellow perch.

This study investigated the temporal-spatial status of P in sediment-water in riparian wetlands located in the southern region of Taihu Basin. Two sets of laboratory simulation study, 1) static columns and 2) steady-flow flumes representing wetland in both dry and rainy seasons, were carried out to understand the characteristics and mechanisms of P interaction between sediment and overlying water. In wetland sediments, significant increases in total P (TP) and NaHCO3 (pH=8.5) extractable P (Olsen-P) occurred with the increase of NaOH+EDTA extractable P (NaOH+EDTA-P). After comparing the P adsorption capacity (Q(max)) with TP in the sediment, there could be a risk of P export from the sediment. In the static column experiment, dynamic characteristics of dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) in the overlying water can be divided into buffer reaction, rapid adsorption, and slow adsorption. A quasi U-pattern curve was observed in the steady-flow flume experiment, i.e., DRP in the overlying water decreased initially and then increased. Because upstream water with high P concentration flowed over the test wetland during rainy seasons, the ecological role of P interception by the sediment could be weakened.					zhang, zhijian/GPK-3598-2022; Li, Shuai/ABD-5132-2021														0277-5212	1943-6246				FEB	2010	30	1					149	157		10.1007/s13157-009-0006-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-009-0006-1													WOS:000275642500013

The life-history patterns of the cladoceran Daphnia hyalina, widely distributed throughout northern temperate lakes, were observed to vary in the presence of different size-selective predators. 2. These changes were apparently initiated by waterborne cues released by predators. 3. In the presence of a cue released by predators preferring large adult D. hyalina, the daphnids reproduced at a smaller size and used a higher percentage of resources for reproduction than in the absence of this cue. The opposite was observed when daphnids were exposed to a cue originating from a predator preferring small juvenile D. hyalina. 4. The chemically induced responses in life-history traits took place within one generation of a single clone. 5.

Use of remotely sensed derived metrics to assess wetland vegetation responses to climate variability-induced drought at the Soetendalsvlei wetland system in the Heuningnes Catchment, Western Cape province, South Africa	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												Wetland vegetation plays an important role in the environmental functioning of wetlands through the provision of ecosystem services, such as food and critical habitat for organisms that live in or near water resources. The ecosystem services provided by wetland vegetation are facing several pressures due to the impacts of drought. Drought can induce significant declines in overall plant productivity and even lead to high rates of plant mortality. Therefore, assessing vegetation response to a drought is important for wetland assessment. In this study, the subtle changes in vegetation distribution were used as a proxy to examine and quantify the extent of drought impacts on the Soetendalsvlei wetland within the Heuningnes Catchment, South Africa. First, the vegetation health information was extracted by calculating the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) during the wet and dry seasons for the period between 2014 and 2018. The derived NDVI results were further statistically linked to the corresponding rainfall and evapotranspiration observed during the study period. An analysis of NDVI results revealed that gradual vegetation health change occurred across the study area. The highest derived NDVI (0.5) for wetland vegetation was observed during 2014, but progressively declined over the years. Change in vegetation health indicated a significant (r = 0.8-0.92) and positive correlation to the amount of rainfall received over the same period, whereas with evapotranspiration the relationships showed an opposite trend (r = -0.7 to -0.5). The results of this study highlight the importance of integrating remotely sensed data and climate variability information in assessing wetland vegetation seasonal and long-term variations. Such information can help in decision-making on the conservation of wetlands and effective monitoring of wetland ecosystems.					; Dube, Timothy/O-5006-2019	Dube, Timothy/0000-0003-3456-8991; NDLALA, NOLUTHANDO/0000-0002-7641-6999													1608-5914	1727-9364				APR 3	2022	47	2					185	196		10.2989/16085914.2021.1993778	http://dx.doi.org/10.2989/16085914.2021.1993778		NOV 2021											WOS:000717371700001

First, based on the real heat transfer process, this study proposes relevant hypotheses and governing equations for heat calculation models involving completely melted water, ice-bearing water, water-soil interface, and soil under water. The models consider the water surface as a thermal boundary on account of the natural buoyancy convection mechanism in water and the phase transition process. Second, this study verifies the accuracy of the calculation models regarding the measured water and permafrost temperatures. The four seasonal vertical temperature changes in the water according to this model are found to be consistent with the actual temperature-change trend, and the permafrost temperature under water is also consistent with the actual temperature field. This study thus provides theoretical support for the thermal impact analysis of water in permafrost regions.

To demonstrate potential changes in lake regime, we used a 12-yr empirical data set of temperature, solar radiation, precipitation, and main-channel water level for the model runs, with the temperature and precipitation modified using results from a 2xCO(2) GCM (general circulation model) run. With these data, modeled water levels for a high-closure lake decline more rapidly between episodes of flooding, ice covers are thinner, and the ice-covered season is much shorter than at present. If precipitation were to decrease slightly instead of increasing slightly as suggested by the GCM, the decrease in lake level between flooding episodes is much faster, and a typical high-closure lake would disappear within 10 yr.																			0024-3590					JUL	1996	41	5					849	856		10.4319/lo.1996.41.5.0849	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1996.41.5.0849													WOS:A1996VN45800006
J	Koppitz, H				Koppitz, H			Effects of flooding on the amino acid and carbohydrate patterns of Phragmites australis	LIMNOLOGICA					Lake Shores 2003 International Conference	JUN 19-21, 2003	Konstanz, GERMANY					Changes in the contents and composition of dissolved amino acids and carbohydrates were monitored in different Phragmites australis stands in Germany. Four different reed clones planted in 1997 in a degraded fen area in NE-Germany were compared with respect to the seasonal development in the total amount of amino acids and sugars in the basal culm internodes. The individual Phragmites clones showed significant differences in the absolute content of both parameters indicating an influence of the genotype. Flooding affected the ratio of amino acids to carbohydrates within the reed clones. Plants grown in flooded parts of the fen area revealed a significantly higher total amino acid content together with a lower total content of carbohydrates. Furthermore, the effects of extreme flooding on the content and composition of amino acids and carbohydrates in the basal culm internodes of Phragmites australis were studied in nine reed stands with different degrees of damage on Lake Constance. Shoots from extremely damaged reed stands were characterised by a significant decrease in the total content of carbohydrates, an increase in the total content of amino acids and an increase in the share of 7 aminobutyric acid. These changes in the content and composition of carbohydrates and amino acids were discussed with respect to their value as stress indicators, such as for oxygen deprivation which causes a hypoxic metabolic state in Phragmites australis stands.																			0075-9511					MAY	2004	34	1-2					37	47		10.1016/S0075-9511(04)80020-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0075-9511(04)80020-3													WOS:000222030800006

Quantitative Biofacies Analysis to Identify Relationships and Refine Controls on Paleosol Development, Prince Creek Formation, North Slope Alaska, USA	GEOSCIENCES												Late Cretaceous coastal plain deposits of the Prince Creek Formation (PCF) offer a rare glimpse into an ancient, high-latitude, arctic greenhouse ecosystem for which there is no modern analog. Here, we employ quantitative biofacies analysis to explore the spatio-temporal variability in PCF palynomorph and microbiota assemblages from nine paleosol horizons exposed along the Colville River, North Slope, Alaska. Biofacies results provide insight into paleoenvironmental controls on the coastal plain ecosystem. Cluster and ordination analyses recognize five biofacies and the following two assemblage types: (1) fern and moss dominated assemblages and (2) algae dominated assemblages. Ordination arrays biofacies along environmental gradients related to soil moisture and marine influence. Fern and moss dominated biofacies from regularly water-logged paleosols along lake and swamp margins on the lower delta plain clearly segregated from algae dominated assemblages of periodically drier levee-overbank paleosols. These results support previous interpretations from the sedimentology, paleopedology, and geochemistry of PCF paleosols that suggest that fluctuations in the water table, related to seasonal river discharge and variations in topography and drainage, controlled soil development and vegetation growth across the coastal plain. This quantitative biofacies-based approach provides an independent predictive tool and cross-check for interpreting environmental conditions along any ancient coastal ecosystem.

The purpose of this study is to analyse the bivariate characteristics of drought (i.e., duration and severity) using two indices including SPI (standard precipitation index) and SPImod (modified SPI) associated with copula functions. For this purpose, rainfall data of six stations were used for the period of 1971-2017. At first, the characteristics of drought were extracted using the two indices. Then, through coding in the MATLAB software environment, eight families of Archimedean copula functions were applied. The simultaneous return period and conditional and Kendall returns were also investigated. The result showed that the Joe copula function was the best predictor for the analysis of both intensity and duration of drought for the study area. The correlation coefficients of Spearman, linear correlation and Tau Kendall computed for the SPI of stations were >0.65, >0.72 and >0.48, respectively, while all of them were significant. At a given critical probability level, t, the value of the Kendall return period was much greater than the standard return period, so that this difference increased with increasing t value. The results obtained from the time series of indices indicated that at least 40% of the months were dry, and the severity of droughts in the Urmia station was much higher than other stations during the studied period. Moreover, SPImod to a large extent eliminates the disadvantages of conventional SPI and takes into account seasonal variations of precipitation in the calculation of SPI.

Although N. awatschensis may serve as an essential energy channel to higher trophic levels, its feeding ecology has been studied only in sheltered and desalinated Lake Kasumigaura. To determine major food sources for N. awatschensis, monthly sampling was conducted during the day along the microtidal Yura River estuary from March 2014 to July 2015. Additional sampling was conducted in May 2019 to assess diel vertical migration in relation to feeding. Microscopic examinations revealed that benthic diatoms (e.g. Bacillaria paxillifer and Navicula spp.) dominated in the stomach irrespective of developmental stage, diel cycle, or season. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios in N. awatschensis and its potential food sources indicated great contributions to the diet of N. awatschensis from benthic microalgae (mainly benthic diatoms) in 2014 and from particulate organic matter (mainly phytoplankton) in 2015. Although N. awatschensis always concentrated close to the bottom in 2019, diel vertical migration might have happened in 2015, when fresh water occupied the whole estuary possibly due to river mouth clogging. Under the stagnant and oligohaline conditions, N. awatschensis could have swum up into the water column and fed on phytoplankton at night in 2015. This hypothesis may resolve the apparent contradiction between the microscopy and stable isotope analysis in 2015. In the Yura River estuary, N. awatschensis feeds primarily on benthic diatoms, although it can utilize phytoplankton flexibly in response to prevailing environmental conditions.

J	Berman, T; Wynne, D				Berman, T; Wynne, D			Assessing phytoplankton lysis in Lake Kinneret	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We determined lysis rates of phytoplankton cells in Lake Kinneret and in lake-water microcosms by measuring the activities of particle-associated and dissolved esterases and the decay rate of the latter. Over a 2-yr period from May 2002, dissolved esterase activity (DEA) in epilimnetic lake water, corrected for nonenzymatic hydrolysis of the assay substrate, fluorescein diacetate (FDA) averaged 39 nmol FDA L-1 h(-1), (range 6-120 nmol FDA L-1 h(-1)) and particulate esterase activity (PEA) averaged 93 nmol FDA L-1 h(-1) (range 20-244 nmol FDA L-1 h(-1)). Algal cell esterase content normalized to chlorophyll (Chl), PEA Chl(-1), averaged 6.9 nmol FDA (mu g Chl)(-1) h(-1), range 0.4-18.7 nmol FDA (mu g Chl)(-1) h(-1). In monoalgal cultures, levels of PEA Chl(-1) also varied widely both with algal species and growth phase. Most (> 90%) of the PEA in the lake was associated with algal cells, thus bacteria, protozoa, and zooplankton were insignificant sources of DEA. Decay rates of DEA in lake water averaged 0.16 (SD +/- 0.13) h(-1) and were much faster than those previously reported for marine waters. Based on these data, calculated phytoplankton lysis rates (LR) in Lake Kinneret averaged 0.91 (SD +/- 0.59) d(-1), with more rapid rates roughly corresponding to seasons of lower Chl concentrations. Because of the high variability in the measured key method parameters (DEA, PEA Chl(-1), DEA decay rates) and uncertainty of extrapolation to daily values, we prefer to regard these rates of phytoplankton lysis as apparent and suggest that they may be overestimates. Nevertheless, our results indicate a sizable flux of PEA from phytoplankton to DEA in this lake and emphasize the potential importance of phytoplankton cell lysis as a dynamic process for transferring material from the particulate phase of the primary producers to the soluble phase in aquatic environments.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				MAR	2005	50	2					526	537		10.4319/lo.2005.50.2.0526	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2005.50.2.0526													WOS:000227835200013
J	Vijverberg, J; Koelewijn, HP; van Densen, WLT				Vijverberg, J; Koelewijn, HP; van Densen, WLT			Effects of predation and food on the population dynamics of the raptorial cladoceran Leptodora kindtii	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We assessed the trophic status of Leptodora kindtii in the food web of a shallow, eutrophic lake in which 0+ age group fish were the main predators. The mean biomass of 0+ fish during three successive years varied from 0.39 g dry wt m(-2) in the first year to 0.05 g dry wt m(-2)in the second year to 2.49 g dry wt m(-2) in the third year. In the years with high fish biomass, densities of small-bodied (< 1-mm) cladocerans (e.g., Bosmina spp., Chydorus sphaericus) were relatively high, whereas in the year with low fish biomass, densities of large-bodied Daphnia galeata were high, and densities of small-bodied cladocerans were lower. During the three study years, the predation pressure of juvenile fish and biomass and production of Leptodora were negatively correlated. Despite the low 0+ fish biomass in the second year, the Leptodora population densities were high only during the first part of the growing season. The elevated Leptodora mortality in July coincided with the lowest observed densities of small-bodied cladocerans, preferred prey items of Leptodora, and with an abundance of large-bodied Daphnia, the preferred food for 0+ fish. We conclude that the population dynamics of Leptodora during the growing season is predominantly regulated by direct predation effects.																			0024-3590					MAR	2005	50	2					455	464		10.4319/lo.2005.50.2.0455	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2005.50.2.0455													WOS:000227835200007
J	Saint-Jacques, N; Harvey, HH; Jackson, DA				Saint-Jacques, N; Harvey, HH; Jackson, DA			Selective foraging in the white sucker (Catostomus commersoni)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												The white sucker (Catostomus commersoni) is a widespread and often abundant North American species. This benthivore can play an important role in the ecology of both fish and benthic communities in lakes and streams. However, the feeding behaviour and ecology of the white sucker have received limited study beyond a description of gut contents from small samples of fish. In this study, the diet of white suckers was determined in relation to season and depth distribution of the fish, as well as to the abundance and type of zoobenthos sampled at the site of fish capture. Suckers fed predominantly on either zoobenthos or zooplankton, with some seasonal variation. They specialized on particular prey and also on the largest individuals within their "speciality," thus exhibiting both resource partitioning and size-selective predation. These findings demonstrate that white suckers can be extremely flexible in their use of resources as opposed to being simple generalist feeders. This attribute, plus their tolerance of a range of environmental conditions, partly explains the abundance of white suckers and their wide distribution in temperate lakes and streams.

J	Brandl, Z				Brandl, Z			Feeding strategies of planktonic cyclopoids in lacustrine ecosystems	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS					6th International Conference on Copepoda	JUL 29-AUG 03, 1996	OLDENBURG, GERMANY					Present knowledge of feeding tactics and behaviour, food composition and consumption, and feeding strategies of planktonic cyclopoid copepods is synthesized. Planktonic freshwater cyclopoids consume both plant and animal food. Predatory feeding is highly selective: prey species differ in their size, defense structures, the distance at which they are recognized by the cyclopoid, defensive behaviour when attacked, and their occurrence in the same space as the predator. Within a prey species, cyclopoids select for smaller individuals. The impact of cyclopoid predation on the other zooplankton may be an important source of mortality. However, algal material is consumed to a large extent by the adult and later developmental stages and is a necessary food source for the youngest stages, which have to compete with other planktonic herbivores. Some implications of these food requirements for life strategies of planktonic cyclopoid species in the seasonally changing environments are discussed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Caceres, CE				Caceres, CE			Seasonal dynamics and interspecific competition in Oneida Lake Daphnia	OECOLOGIA												I investigated the population dynamics and competitive interactions of two species of the suspension-feeding crustacean Daphnia in Oneida Lake, N.Y. Both species have persisted in the lake for decades, but their water-column densities are negatively correlated. The larger Daphnia pulicaria dominates in some years, the smaller D. galeata mendotae in others, and in some years one species replaces the other seasonally. Although this pattern results in part from annual variation in vertebrate predation pressure, predation alone cannot explain the irregular daphnid dynamics. In 1992-1995, I examined the water-column abundances, birth and death rates of both species. D. pulicaria dominated in two years, D. galeata mendotae was replaced by D. pulicaria in one year and in 1994, both species persisted in low numbers. To test the effect of temporal changes on the strength of intra- and interspecific competition on both juvenile and adult daphnids, I manipulated a series of field enclosures in 1994 and 1995. The outcome of competition varied within and between years, and its effects were most evident at the highest densities and lowest resource levels. For adults of both species, the effects of interspecific competition were detected more often than those of intraspecific competition. Lipid reserves (a metric of fitness) among juveniles were generally low, with those of D. galeata mendotae often being less than those of D. pulicaria. Contrary to the results of other studies examining competition in daphnids, spatial segregation and predictable within year reversals in competitive dominance most likely do not play a large role in fostering coexistence of the Oneida Lake daphnids. Instead, coexistence of these competitors is promoted by interannual variation and long-lived diapausing eggs.																			0029-8549	1432-1939				JUN	1998	115	1-2					233	244		10.1007/s004420050512	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s004420050512								28308457					WOS:000074424700029

We used 15 site variables derived from maps to explain forest site productivity in southern and central Finland expressed as dominant height of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.) with ages of 30-110 years. These site variables were grouped into two: Group 1 with seven variables describing geographical conditions of sites including climate, and Group 2 with eight variables describing local morphometric and soil properties. We calculated slope and aspect from a 25 X 25 m DEM. The catchment area, calcium content in soil, length of the growing season, radiation index, sea index, lake index, past highest shoreline and total annual temperature sum with threshold +5 degrees C were also obtained. Then we classified the landforms of 688 sample plots into four major types and 15 sub-types. We applied regression analysis to explain the tree height as a function of the tree age and the phytogeomorphological site variables. When the tree height was explained with the tree age and the Group I variables, the remaining standard error of the model was 16.6-17.9%. When the Group 2 variables were added to the analysis, the standard error decreased slightly. The most significant variables were the temperature sum, latitude coordinate and length of the growing season. Other significant variables were elevation, slope and aspect. The major landform types, sub-types and watershed area did not explain the tree height. Furthermore, if the forest site types determined in the field were included, the remaining standard error decreased by ca. 2%, showing the importance of field information. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

J	Yurista, PM				Yurista, PM			Cyclomorphosis in Daphnia lumholtzi induced by temperature	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Cyclomorphosis is a well known phenomenon in Daphnia that involves a regular, seasonal, or induced change in body allometry. Long helmets and tail spines were induced in laboratory cultures of Daphnia lumholtzi with temperature of 31 degrees C as the proximal cue (temperature of locally occurring peak abundance in Kentucky Lake). The effect was greater in embryos than juveniles or adults exposed to the temperature cue. 2. The temperature cue appears to have a threshold value (animals cultured at 25 or 28 degrees C did not develop elongated helmets or spines). The helmet and spine length receded both with D. lumholtzi kept at a constant 31 degrees C temperature and when water temperature was decreased. 3. The induced helmet in this experiment (0.66 mm, 1.0 mm animal) was significantly longer than values reported in the literature for induction by planktivorous fish kairomones (0.25 mm, 1.2 mm animal). The strong response to a proximal cue of temperature may require the second weaker chemical cue for maintenance. It is suggested that a synergistic explanation with two cues may be more appropriate for cyclomorphosis induction and maintenance in Daphnia lumholtzi that could be tested with further studies.																			0046-5070					FEB	2000	43	2					207	213		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2000.00543.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2000.00543.x													WOS:000085242200004
J	Gehrold, A				Gehrold, Andrea			Species-specific habitat use of wing-moulting waterbirds in response to temporary flightlessness	IBIS												The choice of the moulting habitat is of paramount importance for wing-moulting waterbirds that have to cope with a flightless period of several weeks. However, some species might have more restricted habitat requirements during moult than others, for example due to a highly specialized feeding ecology. The moult-related habitat use of five species (Gadwall Anas strepera, Red-crested Pochard Netta rufina, Common Pochard Aythya ferina, Tufted Duck Aythya fuligula, Coot Fulica atra) was compared at a European inland moulting site that offered a variety of water bodies characterized by different levels of nutrient concentration, water depth, shoreline vegetation density and disturbance. To determine location- and species-specific densities, birds were regularly counted throughout the moulting seasons of 2010 and 2011. In 2011, additional data on Gadwalls were used to assess differences in requirements between the flightless phase of moult and the periods before and after. Furthermore, habitat choice of 38 tagged Gadwalls was compared among two to four successive years. During the moulting season, all species showed clear preferences for specific levels of nutrient content, suggesting an active choice of suitable food sources in both food specialists and generalists. Species showing the strongest attachment to shallow water (Gadwall and Coot) were most sensitive to human disturbance and increasing water depths, and species averse to diving (Gadwall) used ponds with dense shore vegetation while flightless. For Gadwalls, habitat conditions rather than nutrient supply became increasingly important during the flightless phase. Average return rates of 59 and 54% were recorded for male and female Gadwalls, respectively, and the repeated use of familiar locations could be demonstrated in the majority of returning birds (65%). Familiarity with the habitat apparently plays an important role and may enable individuals to compensate for suboptimal conditions at the moulting site.																			0019-1019	1474-919X				OCT	2014	156	4					850	863		10.1111/ibi.12190	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ibi.12190													WOS:000341885300013
J	Apolinarska, K				Apolinarska, Karina			Reconstructions of the early and middle Holocene climate and environment based on δ13C and δ18O records in biogenic carbonates; Lake Niepruszewskie, western Poland	ACTA GEOLOGICA POLONICA												The present study investigates environmental conditions during sediment accumulation in Lake Niepruszewskie, western Poland. Palaeolimnological reconstructions are based on stable isotope composition (delta C-13 and delta O-18) of a wide range of biogenic carbonates occurring in the sediments, including shells of several gastropod species and the bivalve genus Pisidium, carapaces of ostracods belonging to the subfamily Candoninae and encrustations and oogonia of the aquatic macrophyte genus Chara. According to the radiocarbon dates obtained, accumulation of the sediment sequence began in the early Atlantic and terminated in the early Subboreal. Both delta C-13 and delta O-18 records reveal significant and frequent fluctuations that are attributed to repeated changes in the Lake Niepruszewskie water balance. However, conditions of prevailing long water residence time, accompanied by high productivity within the lake, are reflected in a C-13-enriched carbon-isotope record. Minimum delta C-13 and delta O-18 values were recorded for the earliest Atlantic and maximum values characterize the interglacial optimum during the middle and late Atlantic. Discrepancies observed between isotope records of particular taxa reflect the specific season and subhabitat of each carbonate secretion. C-13-enriched Chara encrustations and oogonia are consistent with their precipitation within the photic zone, which is commonly C-13-enriched due to the photosynthetic activity of macrophytes and phytoplankton. The carbon isotope composition of Lymnaea auricularia shells indicates that breathing behaviour leaves its imprint on delta C-13 in snail shells. In aquatic air-breathing pulmonate gastropods this results in C-13-depletion in shells. Isotope records of individual shells of two snail species, Valvata piscinalis and Gyraulus laevis, indicate that in order to obtain mean delta C-13 and delta O-18 values that are representative of a 5 cm thick sampling interval, stable isotope signatures of more than five shells must be obtained.					; Apolinarska, Karina/AAZ-3588-2020	Apolinarska, Karina/0000-0002-3507-5139; 													0001-5709	2300-1887					2009	59	3					359	370																WOS:000271026200004

Tusk pairs in the Ziegler Reservoir mastodon (Mammut americanum) assemblage: Implications for site taphonomy and stratigraphy	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												The Ziegler Reservoir (ZR) mastodon assemblage consists of remains from dozens of individuals that represent one or more populations living in a high-elevation region of the Colorado Rocky Mountains during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5. Several left-right pairs of mastodon mandibular tusks were discovered in different stratigraphic units, challenging previous assumptions that depositional units preserving mastodon remains sample a comparable succession of regional populations through time. It is now recognized as likely that at least some of the specimens contained in these layers were transported from original deposits located on the lake margin, and that successive slumps transported parts of the same skeleton on different occasions, depositing them in different stratigraphic units. Assigning both tusks of a pair to the lowest depositional unit in which either occurs alters the temporal pattern in season of death for ZR mastodons and somewhat modifies a census of individuals, but does not significantly affect the secular trend previously detected in average oxygen isotope values. Two tusks with matching isotope profiles were previously treated as potential evidence of a catastrophic death event that had been proposed to explain the assemblage of remains, but these are now considered to be from the same individual. Newly paired records highlight the importance of careful taphonomic studies for any synthetic analysis of paleoecological history. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

The aircraft position is determined by kinematic global positioning system (GPS) methods. The distance to the glacier surface is determined with a laser ranger. The accuracy is about 0.3 m, sufficient to permit future changes to be observed over short time intervals. Long-term changes can be estimated by comparison of profiles with existing maps. Elevation profiles obtained in 1993-94 from three glaciers in central and south-central Alaska are compared with maps made about 1950. The resulting area-averaged, seasonally corrected thickness changes during the interval are: Gulkana Glacier (central Alaska Range) -11m, Worthington Glacier (central Chugach Mountains) +7 m, and Bear Lake Glacier (Kenai Mountains) -12 m. All three glaciers retreated during the interval of comparison. The estimated uncertainty in the average thickness change is +/-5 m, which is mainly due to errors in the existing maps. Constraints on the accuracy of the maps are obtained by profiling in proglacial areas.

We tested the hypothesis that advective transport regulates zooplankton biomass in the Hudson and in lakes, estuaries, and rivers for which we have published values. In the Hudson, zooplankton biomass was negatively correlated with discharge over the entire season (P < 0.0001) as well as during the warmer period of the year (P = 0.007) when biomass was greatest. The spatial distribution of zooplankton over 160-km transects was heterogeneous. Downstream changes in the abundance of a dominant species, Bosmina longirostris, indicate that certain areas of the river support net population growth whereas other areas are population sinks. We infer that zooplankton biomass in the Hudson is a function of the balance between reproduction determined by resources and losses due to advection. Zooplankton biomass differs among lakes, estuaries, and rivers in a manner consistent with the differences in water residence time. Biomass is highest in lakes, lower in saline estuaries and tidal rivers, and lowest in rivers. Advective losses appear to be important in explaining differences between planktonic communities in lentic and lotic environments.

This study describes and illustrates non-heterocytous filamentous cyanobacteria found in lagoon systems on the coastal plains of Rio Grande do Sul State. Collections were carried out in different freshwater bodies along the eastern (Casamento Lake area) and western (Tapes City area) margins of the Patos Lagoon (UTM 461948-6595095 and 542910-6645535) using a plankton net (25 mu m mesh) in pelagic and littoral zones as well as by squeezing submerged parts of aquatic macrophytes, during both the rainy and dry seasons, from May to December/2003. Twenty two species belonging to the families Phormidiaceae (eight taxa), Pseudanabaenaceae (seven taxa), Oscillatoriaceae (six taxa), and Spirulinaceae (one taxon) were identified. Among these species, five are reported for the first time from Rio Grande do Sul State: Leptolyngbya cebennensis, Microcoleus subtorulosus, Oscillatoria cf. anguina, O. curviceps and Phormidium formosum.

J	Boschker, HTS; Cappenberg, TE				Boschker, HTS; Cappenberg, TE			Patterns of extracellular enzyme activities in littoral sediments of Lake Gooimeer, The Netherlands	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												The seasonal variation in enzymatic activities against protein and several polysaccharides together with esterase as a measure of general hydrolytic activity was studied in a transect of sediments through the littoral zone of Lake Gooimeer, The Netherlands. Absolute activities showed a linear relation with organic matter content of the sediments. Patterns of activities were different between inside and outside a reed bed. Inside, polysaccharide hydrolyzing activities dominated, whereas protein related activity was relatively more important outside the bed. This pattern of activities was related to the polymeric composition of the dominant sources of organic matter as determined in a previous study, which changed from a macrophyte dominance to an algal or cyanobacterial dominated system going from inside to outside the reed bed. This suggests that patterns of enzyme activities can be used as a new approach to infer available sources of organic matter in natural systems.

Three testing stations were established in locations typical of this lake. In the estuarine lake Gardno, one can distinguish three areas with various levels of salinity, with a sampling site for each of these areas. The volume of water taken as samples varied, depending on the techniques used. During the experiment, surface microlayer samples of ca 0.1 and 0.25 mm were obtained. The subsurface water was obtained at the depth of 15 cm. The collected samples were analysed with an atomic absorption spectrometer in order to determine the concentration of cadmium and manganese. Cadmium accumulation in microlayers of surface waters in Lake Gardno was dependent on the concentration of this metal in the deep waters and varied with water salinity. In turn, counts of heterotrophic bacteria had a significant effect on the concentration of manganese. Concentrations of both metals in analyzed surface water microlayers were higher than in the subsurface layer.																			1898-6196						2010	17	4					497	503																WOS:000285632200006

This paper presents the extent of deforestation in Nakuru and Naivasha region (Rift Valley, Central Kenya) between the years 1986 and 2005 and its effects upon thermal characteristics of the landscape. Such changes have immense impact on hydrological regimes of the Rift Valley lakes in central Kenya. Multispectral data from Landsat TM, ETM+ and Terra Aster were used to determinate dense and humid forests as well as their changes over time. A field observation, realized during the "dry" rainy season in October 2008, confirmed evident decline of precipitation and consequent low water discharge from the deforested catchment in the rivers and water level in lakes.					; Hesslerová, Petra/ABF-9902-2020	Hesslerova, Petra/0000-0001-6836-9056; 															978-90-481-9585-5; 978-90-481-9584-8				2010							263	273		10.1007/978-90-481-9585-5_19	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-90-481-9585-5_19	10.1007/978-90-481-9585-5												WOS:000321676000019
J	McCarthy, V; Irvine, K				McCarthy, Valerie; Irvine, Kenneth			A test of stoichiometry across six Irish lakes of low-moderate nutrient status and contrasting hardness	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The importance of stoichiometric food quality constraints in influencing zooplankton community structure and distribution in six lakes with categorical variations in alkalinity were investigated by assessing the relationship between seston nutrient content, bulk zooplankton nutrient content and the abundance of individual zooplankton taxa. Stoichiometric processes were viewed in the context of the overall biotic and abiotic environment. Distinct differences in the distribution of certain zooplankton taxa between high- and low-alkalinity lakes were observed and size-distribution analyses suggested that the size-selective foraging behaviour of fish may have been responsible for determining seasonal variation in community structure. Nevertheless, a positive correlation was observed between bulk zooplankton C:P content and bulk seston C:P content, and a negative relationship between Daphnia abundance and the seston C:P and N:P ratios, which suggests that with declining food P content, high-P taxa are replaced by low-P taxa. This would suggest that stoichiometric food quality constraints are in part involved in structuring the zooplankton community of the six lakes of this study. Although classic models of lake trophic structure based on carbon input (bottom-up) and predation (top-down) may provide explanations for broad community patterns, stoichiometry may provide an alternative or additional mechanism for understanding the details of zooplankton species composition and dynamics.

Plankton Ecology and Diversity	ECOLOGY OF THREATENED SEMI-ARID WETLANDS: LONG-TERM RESEARCH IN LAS TABLAS DE DAIMIEL	Wetlands Ecology Conservation and Management											In this chapter we describe plankton responses induced by fluctuating hydrology and eutrophication process in the semi-arid TDNP wetland. We have followed the planktonic community since 1992, at seasonal and interannual scales, covering as well the spatial heterogeneity of the wetland. The studied planktonic components were bacterioplankton, autotrophic picoplankton, nano and microphytoplankton and zooplankton, including ciliates. Plankton has been studied in terms of species composition (diversity), functional groups, spatial heterogeneity, population dynamics. The present data from this wetland allow us to determine which factors (resources and conditions) are relevant for each group and how their specific responses affect the food web. Bacterioplankton biovolume ranged between 0.1 and 5.0 mm(3) l(-1), autotrophic picoplankton (0-1.7 mm(3) l(-1)), nano- and microphytoplankton (0.03-774 mm(3) l(-1), more than 90% nanoplankton), zooplankton (0.01-280 mm(3) l(-1), more than 50% ciliates). Plankton community shows an evident spatial heterogeneity, with the seasonal and inter annual dynamic of all groups differing between wetland areas. Shallowness and hydrologic conditions impinge strongly on the seasonal dynamics of plankton communities; patterns during drought and wet periods were different. Therefore, a lack of pattern among plankton assemblages is the most remarkable feature. We suggest that alternative states of plankton taxonomic structure in this eutrophic semiarid wetland occur as a sequence of substitutions, due to close coupling with sediment and hydrological disturbance. The autogenic trajectory is not attained and the trophic relationships or top-down control are possibly irrelevant.

Changes in Plasma Retinol of American Kestrels (Falco sparverius) in Response to Dietary or in Ovo Exposure to Environmentally Relevant Concentrations of a Penta-Brominated Diphenyl Ether Mixture, De-71	JOURNAL OF TOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH-PART A-CURRENT ISSUES												Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) are ubiquitous, lipophilic, and bioaccumulative brominated flame retardants. Plasma retinol concentrations of captive adult American kestrels were assessed at the beginning of the breeding season following 3 wk of daily dietary exposure to vehicle (control), low (0.3 ng/g wet weight [ww]), or high (1.6 ng/g ww) concentrations of DE-71 and in their 25-d-old nestlings following embryonic exposure by maternal deposition to environmentally relevant low (291 +/- 48 ng/g ww) or high (1111 +/- 160 ng/g ww) sum (sigma) PBDE concentrations. Unexpectedly, low in ovo concentrations of total--hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) were detected. Plasma retinol concentrations of adult males exposed to higher DE-71 concentrations were negatively correlated with in ovo sigma PBDE, BDE-100, and HBCD levels. Maternal (13%) and nestling (11%) retinol levels were lower in the low-exposure group compared to respective controls, and biologically significant since their retinol levels were correlated with hatching success and growth, respectively. Maternal retinol levels were also correlated with BDE-153. The underlying mechanisms may involve (1) PBDE exposure, hydroxylated (OH-) metabolites, and subsequent changes in retinol mobilization; (2) decreased maternal food consumption; and (3) reduced maternal retinol yolk deposits. The apparent lack of retinol changes in the high-exposure kestrel may reflect compensation occurring, either by increased mobilization and transportation of retinol, and/or higher food consumption in these birds. When highly mobile as evidenced during reproduction or development, retinol concentrations of adult and nestling kestrels are sensitive to environmentally relevant PBDE and HBCD levels.					; Fernie, Kim/NPJ-3036-2025	Fernie, Kim/0000-0003-3073-3208; 													1528-7394	1087-2620					2010	73	23					1645	1654	PII 928293383	10.1080/15287394.2010.501720	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15287394.2010.501720								20967677					WOS:000283322400003

Leaf Area Index (LAI) of reed communities, evaporation rate of open water surface and meteorological conditions were also recorded. Meteorological conditions were divided into sunny, un-sunny (cloudy, overcast) and rainy days, the transpiration rate in rainy days was regarded as 0. Environmental-flow of reed community in different months was calculated according to the transpiration and evaporation. Results show that the environmental-flow differed significantly among different meteorological conditions. In particular, the environmental-flow in sunny condition was 1.58 times of un-sunny conditions on average. Under given meteorological conditions, the environmental-flows of reed communities in the Baiyangdian Lake during June to September in 2006 were 0.19 x 108, 0.25 x 108, 0.38 x 108, and 0.18 x 108m3, The actual environmental-flows of reed communities in Baiyangdian Lake from June to September were 2.25, 2.08, 3.17 and 2.57 times of the estimated values. Meteorological condition had a significant impact on the plants and wetland, when it was full considered the accuracy of environmental-flow calculation would be improved.

A complex of small benthic Fragilaria-type taxa generally dominated the fossil diatom communities reflecting shallow, alkaline, and likely low light conditions resulting from minerogenic turbidity or extensive ice cover throughout the Holocene. Shifts in diatom assemblages occurred with changes in local vegetation, inferred from pollen and stomate records, and shifts in charcoal-inferred fire frequency (e.g., lowering of tree line and reduced fire frequency (approx. 7500 cal. years BP) and establishment of modern alpine tundra (approx. 3500 cal. years BP). Importantly, striking changes in diatom communities (e.g., during the mid-Holocene (approx. 5500 to approx. 3500 cal. years BP) and Medieval Warm Period (approx. AD 800 to approx. AD 1250)) occurred without evidence of vegetation shifts. During these times, diverse periphytic diatoms dominated suggesting improved benthic habitat availability with longer growing seasons and probably reduced alkalinity and turbidity with warmer- and wetter-than-present climates. Diatom analysis from this alpine lake provides a sensitive record of climate-related limnological responses, but also refines our previous understanding of Holocene climate changes in the northern Rocky Mountains inferred from terrestrial-based paleoecological records.					; Smol, John/A-8838-2015	Pisaric, Michael/0000-0003-3806-8986; Smol, John/0000-0002-2499-6696; 													0008-4026					AUG	2005	83	8					968	982		10.1139/B05-045	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/B05-045													WOS:000232856200003

The succession of phytoplanktonic populations with a monospecific trend permits the large differences in FA composition according to phytoplanktonic classes, or even according to genera for dominant algae to be pointed out. Thus, we have established that Chlorophyceae had a high content of 18:3(n-3), 20:4(n-3) and 16:3(n-3) FA, whereas Dinophyceae could be identified by higher 16:0, 18:4(n-3), 20:5(n-3) and 22:6(n-3) FA levels, and lower 18:3(n-3) and C16 polyunsaturated FA levels. Diatoms could be characterized by high values of the FA ratio [14:0 + 16:1(n-7) + 16:2(n-4) + 16:3(n-4) + 16: 4(n-1)/16:0]. In addition, a close relationship was noted, on one hand, between Aulacoseira italica biomass and a high 16:2(n-4), 16:3(n-4) and 16:4(n-1) FA level and, on the other hand, between Asterionella formosa biomass and high 14:0 and 16:1(n-7) levels. So, the main phytoplanktonic classes or genera were characterized by some FA or ratios of FA, which could be used as specific natural biomarkers for studying the transfer of organic matter through the aquatic food web.																			0142-7873					APR	1997	19	4					469	490		10.1093/plankt/19.4.469	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/19.4.469													WOS:A1997WT34400005

Our results showed that there was no significant difference between the mean of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the wet season (3. 90 +/- 0. 40) mg .

S-275 similar to 295 in the wet season (21. 48 +/- 1. 56) mu m(-1) was significantly higher than that in the dry season (19. 24 +/- 0. 98) mu m(-1) (t-test, p<0. 001). Using CDOM fluorescence and parallel factor analysis, four fluorescence components were obtained including a microbial humic-like C1, a tryptophan-like C2, a tyrosine-like C3, and a terrestrial humic-like C4. C1 and C4 increased with increasing TP, TN, Chl-a, and DOC (p<0. 01), and we further found a positive relationship between DOC and tryptophan-like C2 (p<0. 05). There were seasonal differences in the optical component and sources of CDOM in Chaohu. In the wet season, terrestrial humic-rich CDOM contributed primarily while in the wet-to-dry transition season, autochthonous CDOM derived from algal degradation contributed to the lake's CDOM pool. In order to protect the water quality of the lake effectively, certain control measures should be carried out in the watersheds of the Shiwuli River and the Nanfei River.																			1000-0593					OCT	2021	41	10					3286	3293		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2021)10-3286-08	http://dx.doi.org/10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2021)10-3286-08													WOS:000715857400048

Abundance of the salamander Ambystoma andersoni in relation to seasonal dynamics and spatial heterogeneity in Zacapu Lake, Michoacan, Mexico	REVISTA MEXICANA DE BIODIVERSIDAD												The presence and abundance of amphibians is highly related to habitat characteristics and seasonal dynamics (rainy and dry seasons). In this study, Ambystoma andersoni was used to determine the relationship between the abundance and the environmental dynamics in Zacapu Lake, Michoacan, Mexico. Monthly samplings were performed in 9 sites grouped in 3 zones (east, centre, west) along the rainy and dry seasons. Physicochemical parameters -temperature, oxygen concentration and pH- and spatial heterogeneity -vegetation, substrate- were measured in situ. The results showed significant seasonal differences in the abundance of A. andersoni (rainy vs. dry) and spatially (zone). In general, Zacapu Lake showed a low seasonal difference regarding the limnological variables obtained, highlighting significant differences between zones in temperature and pH. However, temporal and spatial differences in the abundance of A. andersoni were present, and showed a positive relation with both variables. These results are useful to propose management and conservation plans (e.g., priority zones and local fisheries) of a microendemic species of amphibian occurring in an area with high anthropic impact.

These were S. damnosum s.s., S, dieguerense, S. konkourense, S. leonense, S. sanctipauli, S, sirbanum, S. soubrense, S. squamosum, and S. yahense. Some of these species were found to consist of two chromosomal variant populations. These were S. konkourense 'Konkoure' and 'Menankaya' forms, S. sanctipauli sensu stricto and 'Djodji' form, S. soubrense 'Chute Milo' and 'Beffa' forms. The distribution of these twelve cytological taxa was assessed in relation to the two main vegetation zones of West Africa (forest and savanna), topography, river size and other factors. The range of each species was influenced by seasonal climatic changes in wind movement and river water level. The most widely distributed species were S. sirbanum and S. damnosum s.s., associated with savanna areas, recorded from all river basins. Simulium dieguerense was restricted mainly to Western Mall on the Rivers Bafing and Bakoye in the Senegal River basin. Simulium squamosum was identified from rivers draining mountainous areas in both the forest and savanna zones. Simulium yahense was found in small permanent rivers along a wide forested band parallel to the coast and was absent from the plains of Togo and Benin. Members of the S. sanctipauli subcomplex had restricted distributions except for S. sanctipauli s.s., which was widespread in large rivers of the forest zone from Sierra Leone to the Volta Lake in Ghana. Simulium soubrense 'Beffa' form occurred in Togo and Benin, S. soubrense 'Chutes Milo' form in Guinea, both 'Konkoure' and 'Menankaya' forms of S. konkourense occurred predominantly in Guinea and S. leonense in Sierra Leone. The relevance of the distribution maps and the importance of the data bank to vector control larvicidal operations are discussed.																			0269-283X					OCT	1998	12	4					345	358		10.1046/j.1365-2915.1998.00118.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2915.1998.00118.x								9824818					WOS:000076933100002

These samples have been analyzed for alkanes, triterpenes, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). We found that naturally occurring hydrocarbons predominate in the river and on the shelf These hydrocarbons include biogenic alkanes and triterpenes with a higher plant/peat origin, diagenetic PAHs from peat and plant detritus, petrogenic alkanes, triterpenes, and PAHs from oil seeps and/or bitumens, and combustion PAHs that are likely relict in peat deposits. Because these components vary independently, the season is found to strongly influence the concentration and composition of hydrocarbons in the Mackenzie River. While essentially the same pattern of alkanes, diagenetic hopanes, and alkyl PAHs is observed in all river and most shelf sediment samples, alkane and triterpene concentration variations are strongly linked to the relative amount of higher plant/peat material. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecular-mass profiles also appear to be tied primarily to varying proportions of peat, with an additional petrogenic component which is most likely associated with lithic material mobilized by the Mackenzie River at freshet. Consistent with the general lack of alkyl PAHs in peat, the higher PAHs found in the river are probably derived from forest and tundra fires. A few anthropogenic/pyrogenic compounds are manifest only at the shelf edge, probably due to a weakening of the river influence. We take this observation of pyrogenic PAHs and the pronounced source differences between two sediment samples collected at the shelf edge as evidence of a transition from dominance by the Mackenzie River to the geochemistry prevalent in Arctic regions far removed from major rivers.					; Macdonald, Robie/A-7896-2012	Macdonald, Robie/0000-0002-1141-8520; 													0016-7037	1872-9533				JUL	1993	57	13					3041	3061		10.1016/0016-7037(93)90292-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(93)90292-5													WOS:A1993LM78800009
J	FERNANDO, CH				FERNANDO, CH			ZOOPLANKTON, FISH AND FISHERIES IN TROPICAL FRESH-WATERS	HYDROBIOLOGIA												About 40% of all fish species occur in freshwater, although only 1% of the globe is occupied by freshwaters. The tropics harbour a high percentage of these fishes. Freshwater zooplankton on the other hand is far less diverse than its marine counterpart and the tropics do not harbour a markedly high percentage of freshwater species either. The antecedents of freshwater zooplankton appear to have come from riverine and terrestrial habitats via temporary habitats (ponds, floodplains). The present zooplankton composition has also been shaped by, among other factors, the highly efficient zooplanktivorous modern teleosts which have restricted the formerly widespread Branchiopoda mainly to fishless freshwaters. Those Branchiopoda frequently co-existing with fishes (Cladocera) have their size composition strongly influenced by fish predation. Circumstantial evidence indicates that pelagic zooplankton (Cladocera, Copepoda, Rotifera) appear to provide a relatively scarce food supply relative to the littoral region for the early stages of fishes. Also, unpredictability of zooplankton may be involved here. These factors have led to the loss of planktonic eggs and the siting of fish breeding in shallow littoral situations, where other animal foods besides zooplankton are also available, especially for later stages of juvenile fish. The Ostariophysi breed in the shallow expanses of flood waters while the Cichlidae, some of which breed like Ostariophysi, also breed in standing waters in the littoral of lakes or floodplains. In all these locations zooplankton and benthic organisms, especially insects, are available. The cichlids are, in addition, provided with parental care. Predation on young fishes is also reduced by these strategies. Young fishes may also be adapted to feed on patches of zooplankton and other food in their breeding grounds. Tropical pelagic clupeids and cyprinids may breed continuously. Some of these clupeids in rivers breed at low water. Zooplankton, supplemented by other animal food is more critical to achieving the potential fish yields in the tropics than in temperate freshwaters because fish yields in the tropics can be very high indeed. The high metabolic rate of young fishes in the tropics adds to the demand for food. Tropical freshwaters have a relatively high primary production but a low zooplankton/phytoplankton ratio. Zooplankton is kept small in size and biomass by continuous predation. Herbivorous fishes can sustain very high fish yields in the tropics but they must have a high fecundity and high survival of young produced seasonally, mainly in rivers or even continuously as in lakes and reservoirs to weather predation. Rich littoral zooplankton and benthos combined with omnivory and a higher efficiency in the use of the available animal food by newly hatched fishes may be critical factors linking fish yields to zooplankton in tropical freshwaters. The ability of herbivorous tilapias to give very high fish yields in shallow tropical lakes may also be due to their efficient use of animal food, algae and microphagy in young stages besides other favourable adaptations like opportunistic feeding on detrities and the ability to feed on and digest cyanobacteria, abundant in the tropics. The high percentage of the global fish species found in freshwaters and the ability of some species to produce very high fish yields is proof that biological strategies used by freshwater fishes are highly successful. Recently, it has been shown that an ancient marine food chain duplicated in the ancient tropical lake, Tanganyika, is far more efficient than more recently evolved food chains in lakes and reservoirs. Understanding these strategies will assist both in fish culture and management of freshwater fisheries.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN 7	1994	272	1-3					105	123		10.1007/BF00006516	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00006516													WOS:A1994MV62000010

The lake serves for recreation and as an operational water reservoir, supplying a quarter of the water consumption of Israel. Analysis by closed loop stripping apparatus (CLSA), coupled with GC/MSD, olfactory GC and other detectors, revealed that the odorous compounds belong to the methylsulfide Family, including, dimethylsulfide, dimethyldisulfide, dimethyltrisulfide and methyl methanethiosulfonate. The odor episodes coincide with a bloom of Peridinium gatunense algae. Peridinium gatunense rich samples, taken from the lake during the bloom season, emitted the same sulfur compounds. Depth profiles of Peridinium algae, sulfur compounds, dissolved oxygen, pH and temperature revealed strong correlation between the algal photoinduced motion in the water column and the distribution of dimethyldisulfide and dimethyltrisulfide, while the concentrations of dimethylsulfide and methyl methanethiosulfonate did not follow the same trend. In all cases, the dimethyloligosulfides were produced in the oxic region and were independent of the anoxic conditions in the hypolimniumon or in the sediment. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Comparison of streamflow patterns in drainages of two major terminal basins: the United States Great Basin and Mongolia's Central Asian Internal Drainage	INLAND WATERS												Current understanding of how streamflow in terminal basins is driven by climatic and hydrogeomorphic characteristics is limited, despite the fact that these closed systems show an increased sensitivity to climate change in terms of streamflow and an increase in demand for water resources. We examined streamflow patterns in 2 major terminal basins, the Great Basin in the United States (US-TB) and the Central Asian Internal Drainage in Mongolia (MN-TB). We obtained daily flow data spanning 1990 to 2014 for both basins, established hydrological indices (HIs), and selected a subset of HIs that best described streamflow patterns. A between-class analysis was used to detect differences in streamflow patterns between these basins. We employed the RESonate tool to delineate hydrogeomorphic patches (HPs), evaluated streamflow variation across distinct HPs, and examined ranges of streamflow variation and hydrogeomorphic variation expressed in each of the terminal basins. Of a subset of 45 HIs, seasonal high flow, flooding frequency, and baseflow best characterized streamflow in HPs. Streamflow in MN-TB was driven by high flow duration, whereas in US-TB streamflow was characterized by significantly larger low-flow conditions. The MN-TB exhibited a greater range of streamflow variation between HPs but showed a lesser range of variation in hydrogeomorphology. Our study is the first to establish HIs and describe streamflow patterns in terminal basins on a large scale. Our study also contributes needed perspectives on streamflow patterns in 2 different terminal basins with complex topographies, thereby providing valuable information for stream ecologists and water resource managers.					; Maasri, Alain/F-7995-2010	Erdenee, Bolortsetseg/0000-0002-7674-1580; Maasri, Alain/0000-0003-1236-8374; Gelhaus, Jon/0000-0003-1249-6739; Hayford, Barbara/0000-0001-9680-2179; Thorp, James/0000-0003-2757-9860													2044-2041	2044-205X				JUL 3	2021	11	3					368	380		10.1080/20442041.2021.1956269	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20442041.2021.1956269		SEP 2021											WOS:000698288300001
J	Butchart, SHM				Butchart, SHM			Population structure and breeding system of the sex-role reversed, polyanduous Bronze-winged Jacana Metopidius indicus	IBIS												Bronze-winged Jacanas Metopidius indicus studied from 1995 to 1997 at Vembanur lake in southern India had a consistent sex-ratio bias of about 1.9 males per female. Only half of males and females defended territories and thus could breed; the remaining birds were non-resident floaters. Floaters were lighter and younger than residents. Bronze-winged Jacanas were sea-role reversed: females were 60.3% heavier and behaviourally dominant to males, which carried out all the incubation and chick care. The ratio of potential reproductive rates was skewed to females by about 4:1, indicating that strongly reversed sexual selection probably operates in this species. Each year about 60% of resident females were monogamous and 40% were polyandrous with up to four males. Over 60% of resident males were in polyandrous groups. Heavier females had larger harems and produced more clutches per season. The peak breeding season was late July to early September. Over 90% of clutches were depredated before hatching. Nearly half of clutches of artificial eggs were attacked by rodents, the rest by birds. Mean clutch mass was only 16.8% of female mass, giving this species one of the greatest capacities of any shorebird for laying multiple clutches. High predation rates and low energetic costs of parental care may have been important factors influencing the evolution of sex-role reversal and polyandry in jacanas.					; Butchart, Stuart/Y-2711-2018	Butchart, Stuart/0000-0002-1140-4049; 													0019-1019	1474-919X				JAN	2000	142	1					93	102																WOS:000084564900012
J	SMITH, RMH; ERIKSSON, PG; BOTHA, WJ				SMITH, RMH; ERIKSSON, PG; BOTHA, WJ			A REVIEW OF THE STRATIGRAPHY AND SEDIMENTARY ENVIRONMENTS OF THE KAROO-AGED BASINS OF SOUTHERN AFRICA	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES												The Karoo Basin of South Africa was one of several contemporaneous intracratonic basins in southwestern Gondwana that became active in the Permo-Carboniferous (280 Ma) and continued to accumulate sediments until the earliest Jurassic, 100 million years later. At their maximum areal extent during the early Permian, these basins covered some 4.5 million km2. The present outcrop area of Karoo rocks in southern Africa is about 300 000 km2 with a maximum thickness of some 8000 m. The economic importance of these sediments lies in the vast reserves of coal within the Ecca Group rocks of northern and eastern Transvaal and Natal, South Africa. Large reserves of sandstone-hosted uranium and molybdenum have been proven within the Beaufort Group rocks of the southern Karoo trough, although they are not mineable in the present market conditions. Palaeoenvironmental analysis of the major stratigraphic units of the Karoo succession in South Africa demonstrates the changes in depositional style caused by regional arid localized tectonism within the basin. These depocentres were influenced by a progressive aridification of climate which was primarily caused by the northward drift of southwestern Gondwana out of a polar climate and accentuated by the meteoric drying effect of the surrounding land masses. Changing palaeoenvironments clearly influenced the rate and direction of vertebrate evolution in southern Gondwana as evidenced by the numerous reptile fossils, including dinosaurs, which are found in the Karoo strata of South Africa, Lesotho, Namibia and Zimbabwe. During the Late Carboniferous the southern part of Gondwana migrated over the South Pole resulting in a major ice sheet over the early Karoo basin and surrounding highlands. Glacial sedimentation in upland valleys and on the lowland shelf resulted in the Dwyka Formation at the base of the Karoo Sequence. After glaciation, an extensive shallow sea covered the gently subsiding shelf, fed by large volumes of meltwater. Marine clays and muds accumulated under cool climatic conditions (Lower Ecca Group) including the distinctive Mesosaurus-bearing carbonaceous shales of the Whitehill Formation. Subduction of the palaeo-Pacific plate reslted in an extensive chain of mountains which deformed and later truncated the southern rim of the main Karoo Basin. Material derived from these ''Gondwanide'' mountains as well as from the granitic uplands to the north-east, accumulated in large deltas that prograded into the Ecca sea (Upper Ecca Group). The relatively cool and humid climate promoted thick accumulations of peat on the fluvial and delta plains which now constitute the major coal reserves of southern Africa. As the prograding deltas coalesced, fluvio-lacustrine sediments of the Beaufort Group were laid down on broad gently subsiding alluvial plains. The climate by this time (Late Permian) had warmed to become semi-arid with highly seasonal rainfall. Vegetation alongside the meander belts and semi-permanent lakes supported a diverse reptilian fauna dominated by therapsids or ''mammal-like reptiles''. Pulses of uplift in the southern source areas combined with possible orographic effects resulted in the progadation of two coarse-grained alluvial fans into the central parts of the basin (Katberg Sandstone Member and Molteno Formation). In the upper Karoo Sequence, progressive aridification and tectonic deformation of the basin through the late Triassic and early Jurassic led to the accumulation, in four separate depositories, of ''redbeds'' which are interpreted as fluvial and flood-fan, playa and dune complexes (Elliot Formation). This eventually gave way to westerly wind-dominated sedimentation that choked the remaining depositories with fine-grained dune sand. The interdune areas were damp and occasionally flooded and provided a habitat for small dinosaurs and the earliest mammals. During this time (Early Jurassic), basin wide volcanic activity began as a precursor to the breakup of Gondwana in the late Jurassic and continued until the early Cretaceous. This extrusion of extensive flood basalts (Drakensberg Group) onto the Clarens landscape eventually brought Karoo sedimentation to a close.

A growth curve was estimated on the basis of monthly standard length. The relationship between standard length and weight was utilized for calculating the mean weight on the survey day in a particular month. Total monthly catches in Lake Kasumigaura and Lake Kitaura were calculated using partial monthly pond smelt catch obtained from processing plants located near the lakes between July and December. The total monthly catch was calculated from the total monthly catch weight and the monthly mean weight. The number of boats operating each month, compiled by the Kasumigaura-Kitaura Fisheries Office of Ibaraki Prefecture, was also employed. The estimated initial population sizes were compared with the population level index (PLI) estimated from survey data before the start of the fishing season. No significant differences were detected among the initial population sizes estimated by DeLury method, cohort analysis and PLI. The estimates ranged from 7.4 million to 410 million in Lake Kasumigaura, and from 7.7 million to 44 million in Lake Kitaura.

These reservoirs are engineered systems designed to serve specific purposes. Water from these sources is not only utilized for drinking purposes, but also for commercial and industrial use. Thus, a thorough limnological study is essential. The present study is carried out at Bakreswar reservoir in Birbhum district, which was created by the dam, built on Bakreswar River. The major purpose of the reservoir is to supply drinking water to the surrounding villages and to use Bakreswar Thermal Power Station for cooling their power plant. A previous study on this reservoir has shown temporal variation of environmental factors as well as good assemblage of zooplankton. In order to get a more detailed preview on zooplankton groups, seasonal diversity is calculated for four major groups of zooplanktons (Cladocera, Ostracoda, Copepoda and Rotifera) with the software PAST. Spatial pattern analysis of zooplankton community is also performed to propose possible hypotheses explaining reasons underlying the causal factors for any such variation. Moreover, community ordination is done using SPSS 20 to understand the overall ecosystem functioning of the reservoir. The results show that Station I and Station III are more diversified in all the seasons compared to Station II. The mode of distribution is clumped, and the degree of clumping varied with different functional groups of studied zooplankton as seen in the two methods used. So it can be concluded that the zooplankton community of this reservoir is diverse and shows horizontal clumped distribution pattern and niche separation among the groups to avoid competition. The results help in formulating proper strategies for advanced water quality management and conservation of reservoir ecosystem.					; RAKSHIT, DR.

Composition and dispersal of riverine and lake phytoplankton communities in connected systems with different water retention times	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Lake phytoplankton community structure may be influenced by both internal factors (predation, competition, resource constraints) and external ones, such as dispersal of materials and cells between connected habitats. However, little is known about the importance of cell dispersal for phytoplankton community structure in lakes. 2. We investigated the abundance and dispersal of phytoplankton cells between connected rivers and lakes, and analysed whether similarities in phytoplankton community composition between rivers and lakes were primarily related to cell import rates or to characteristics of the local habitat. We focused on lakes along a gradient of theoretical water retention times (TWRT). Two data sets from Swedish lakes were used; a seasonal study of two connected boreal forest lakes, differing in TWRT, and a multi-lake study of 13 lakes with a continuous range of TWRTs. 3. Phytoplankton cells were transported and dispersed in all investigated rivers. In the seasonal study, cell import rates and similarities in phytoplankton community composition between the lake and its inlet(s) were much higher in the lake with a shorter TWRT. Phytoplankton community structure in different habitats was associated with total organic carbon (TOC). This indicates that local habitat characteristics may be important in determining lake phytoplankton community composition, even in the presence of substantial cell import. 4. The multi-lake study also showed a negative relationship between TWRT and similarities in phytoplankton community composition between inlets and lakes. Moreover, similarity in community structure was related to both cell import rates from inlet to lake and differences in habitat characteristics between inlet and lake. However, the variable most strongly correlated with community structure was TOC, indicating that species sorting rather than a mass effect was the most important mechanism underlying the correlation between community structure and retention time. 5. Overall, our data suggest that local habitat characteristics may play a key role in determining community similarity in this set of lakes covering a large range of habitat connectedness. Due to the strong co-variations between cell dispersal and TOC, it was hard to unequivocally disentangle the different mechanisms; hence, there is a need for further studies of the role of dispersal for phytoplankton community structures.

A total of nine sampling sites were selected in this study, namely: Sungai Datang (St. 1), Sungai Cenahan (St. 2), downstream of Sungai Gumum (St. 3), mid of Sungai Gumum (St. 4), Sungai Kura-kura (St. 5), Sungai Melai (St. 6), Sungai Jemberau (St. 7), upstream of Sungai Paya Merupuk (St. 8) and downstream of Sungai Paya Merupuk (St. 9). Eleven water quality parameters were selected and analyzed in-situ and ex-situ during two sampling seasons. Laboratory analyses were carried out according to the HACH and APHA. Results of the study indicated that the pH content ranged from 3.2 to 6.32, dissolved oxygen from 0.27 to 6.4 mg/L, conductivity from 14.33 to 85.7 mu S/cm and temperature from 24.1 to 32.1 degrees C. Total dissolved solids ranged from 22.67 to 184 mg/L, total suspended solids from 1.17 to 79.11 mg/L and turbidity from 4.67 to 28.67 NTU. Nutrients such as ammonical nitrogen (0.01 to 0.57 mg/L), nitrate (0.7 to 2.9 mg/L), phosphate (from not detectable to 0.50 mg/L) and sulphate (from not detectable to 2.0 mg/L) were also studied. This showed that most of the feeder rivers have contributed to high nutrient values in Tasik Chini. Statistically, the relationship between water quality parameters were correlated as very weak and moderately correlated (R(2) = 0.40). Phosphate and sulphate were significantly correlated as positive slope; turbidity and nitrate showed negative slope with discharge during both the seasons (R(2) = 0.651; R(2) = 0.624). Recent activities such as deforestation, mining, agriculture and tourism have taken place in the surrounding areas of the lake. These activities were expected to influence the stability of the water quality of the feeder river of Tasik Chini.

Sixteen Amazonian, Andean, and Caribbean lakes, lagoons, and swamps were sampled over a year. The aim was to determine if it was possible to obtain a reliable matrix of input pigment ratios that may be used in freshwater habitats with different environmental conditions. There were no clear differences among regions for most of the ratios of marker pigments to Chlorophyll a (Chl a) in most of the phytoplankton groups. Only the zeaxanthin/Chl a ratio showed clear variations among areas. The estimates for the mean relative contribution of each phytoplankton group calculated for the pigment ratios obtained in each separate habitat and season were very similar to the estimates calculated using the average pigment ratio obtained for all habitats and seasons. Our study suggests that the matrix of the average pigment ratio obtained in this study can be used to estimate phytoplankton class abundances with the CHEMTAX program in freshwater habitats with different limnological conditions.					; Barreiro, Aldo/C-9472-2012; Barreiro Felpeto, Aldo/C-9472-2012	Aranguren-Riano, Nelson J./0000-0003-0117-1015; Aguirre, Nestor/0000-0002-0047-3807; Barreiro Felpeto, Aldo/0000-0002-8196-3823													1541-5856					DEC	2008	6						643	652		10.4319/lom.2008.6.643	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lom.2008.6.643													WOS:000208058700001

Previous investigations paid more attention to TSS of the surface layer in reservoirs, while suspended particles are prone to settle, resuspend, and aggregate at the bottom of reservoir. There may be different patterns of the TSS in different depths. This study is to assess the TSS concentration by weight analysis, find the evidence of the existence of flocculated suspended particles by in situ underwater imaging analysis, and discuss the impact of the flocculation process of suspended solids on water quality in deep reservoirs. Although the TSS concentration is lower than other reservoirs with the same trophic level, many flocs were found at the bottom of the deep-water area (> 15 m) in the Biliuhe Reservoir according to the recordings of the in situ underwater camera. The further comprehensive analysis demonstrates that the fine particle in flood season and resuspension is the main source of suspended flocs at the bottom of the reservoir. While the slow settling velocity results in the flocculation of fine suspended particles and long-term residence in the bottom layer of the reservoir. TSS has a significant correlation with iron and total phosphorus. Resuspension, flocculation, and settling impact on the transport of suspended sediment and associated contaminants. The evidence from this study suggests that the impact of flocs on water quality should be further discussed to ensure water supply safety.

J	Raisin, GW; Mitchell, DS; Croome, RL				Raisin, GW; Mitchell, DS; Croome, RL			The effectiveness of a small constructed wetland in ameliorating diffuse nutrient loadings from an Australian rural catchment	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												This paper assesses the capacity of a small (450 m(2)) constructed wetland in Victoria, Australia, to decrease nutrient loads generated by both background flows and storm events within the period March 1993 to January 1995. Under Australian conditions the effectiveness of wetlands in controlling diffuse pollution is influenced by extreme hydrological events which often carry a large proportion of the annual load from the catchment. The wetland retained a varying proportion of the nitrogen and phosphorus load over a range of hydrological events and seasonal conditions. The wetland also acted as a source of these nutrients on occasions. An annual nutrient budget was calculated for the period February 1994 to January 1995 by measuring all loads between and during storm events entering and leaving the wetland. The wetland 'retained' 10 kg N yr(-1) (23 g N m(-2) yr(-1)) of nitrogen and 1.24 kg P yr(-1) (2.80 g P m(-2) yr(-1)) of phosphorus, representing 11 and 17%, respectively of the incoming nutrient loads for the budget period. Storm event size influenced the impact of the wetland on the nutrient loads generated in these events. Increasing event volumes generally resulted in decreased nutrient interception. The results of this study indicate that for significant load reduction to occur the scale of the wetland should be such that there is sufficient residence time to enable wetland processes to operate. Small strategically located wetlands high up in catchments which will have a cumulative impact on runoff generated in large storm events are likely to be more effective in intercepting nutrient loads than larger downstream structures.

J	Mustapha, MK				Mustapha, Moshood K.			Phytoplankton assemblage of a small, shallow, tropical African reservoir	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												I measured physico-chemical properties and phytoplankton in the small, shallow tropical reservoir of Oyun (Offa, Nigeria) between January 2002 and December 2003. 1 identified 25 phytoplankton genera in three sampling stations. Bacillariophyceae dominated (75.3%), followed by Chlorophyceae (12.2%), Cyanobacteria (11.1%) and Desmidiaceae (0.73%). The high amount of nutrients (e.g. nitrate, phosphate, sulphate and silica) explain phytoplankton heterogeneity (p<0.05). Phytoplankton was abundant during the rainy season, but the transition period had the richest assemblage and abundance. Fluctuations in phytoplankton density were a result of seasonal changes in concentration of nutrients, grazing pressure and reservoir hydrology. The reservoir is eutrophic with excellent water quality and a diverse phytoplankton assemblage: fish production would be high. These conditions resulted from strategies such as watershed best management practices (BMPs) to control eutrophication and sedimentation, and priorities for water usage established through legislation. Additional measures are recommended to prevent oligotrophy, hypereutrophy, excessive phytoplankton bloom, toxic cyanobacteria, and run-off of organic waste and salts. Rev. Biol.

This study evaluates the ecological requirements of the species, and includes a survey of the literature. Although S. lapponica has been reported thus far only in the Northern Hemisphere, the probability of its bipolar distribution is relatively high (22%). Distribution is probably ecologically determined, water temperature (correlated with latitude or seasonal fluctuations), and lower pH seem to be the primary environmental variables. A local vs. global ratio reflects, to a certain extent, the degree of sampling effort expended in the studied area, but a considerable increase in the number of revealed taxa was apparent when the area was expanded.

Trin. ex Steud. were studied in wetlands in the Czech Republic (Rozmberk fishpond), Hungary (Lake Ferto and Kis-Balaton), and Denmark (Vejlerne Nature Reserve). Pore water concentrations of lactic, formic, acetic, propionic, butyric, oxalic, citric, tartaric, malic and fumaric acid were analysed by HPLC and shown to vary both qualitatively and quantitatively between sites. Acetic acid was prevalent at all sites, and dominated together with citric, malic, and tartaric acid at Rozmberk fishpond, with lactic and oxalic acid at Lake Ferto and Kis-Balaton, and with lactic and propionic acid at Vejlerne Nature Reserve. The maximum total concentrations of organic acids recorded were 2984 and 2215 mu mol l(-1) at a land and a deep-water site of Rozmberk fishpond, 1673 and 2216 mu mol l(-1) at a healthy and damaged stand of Lake Ferto, 1006 and 1642 mu mol l(-1) at a healthy and damaged stand of Kis-Balaton, and 570 and 223 mu mol l(-1) at a healthy reed stand and a lagoon at Vejlerne Nature Reserve, respectively. At Rozmberk fishpond the concentrations of lower organic acids were considered sufficiently high to diminish the plants vigour and possibly to induce die-back. At Lake Ferto and Kis-Balaton the organic acids are unlikely to have had a toxic effect on the reeds at the sampling time because of the relatively high pH (similar to 7) in these wetlands. However, because of the great spatial and seasonal variability in organic acid speciation and concentration, organic acid phytotoxity may affect the reed also at these sites. At Vejlerne Nature Reserve, the toxic effect on the reeds is unlikely because of consistently low concentrations of organic acids. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Hrivnák, R				Hrivnák, R			Effect of ecological factors on the zonation of wetland vegetation	ACTA SOCIETATIS BOTANICORUM POLONIAE												The influence of some ecological factors to aquatic and marsh vegetation was studied during 1998-2000. Three basic vegetation units (Caricetum buekii, Typhetum latifoliae and Ceratophylletum submersi) and three transitional communities were defined in the belt transect, which was established along the moisture gradient. The content of available soil nutrients in individual vegetation types differed only in case of the Ceratophyllum submersum community, where a higher magnesium and nitrogen content accumulated due to specific environmental conditions. Water and marsh vegetation is usually characterised by a pronounced spatial and temporal dynamics. In the studied area, its zonation was dependent from the terrain morphology, and both depth and duration of floods. The fluctuation of ground and surface water table during a three-year period caused changes in the occurrence and cover of several species (e.g. Carex buekii, Typha latifolia, aquatic macrophytes). Pronounced changes in the cover of some species occurred even within a single vegetation season due to the long-term sink of water table below the ground surface.

Water temperature, conductivity, pH, total alkalinity, dissolved oxygen, and concentrations of NH4-N, NO2-N, NO3-N, total-N, PO4-P, total-P, DOC, and chlorophyll-a were measured in seven rivers stretches (sampling stations). Total yeasts, faecal and total coliforms, and heterotrophic bacteria were also determined. The studied areas were considered to be under oligotrophic to eutrophic conditions. The variables that presented highest positive correlation with faecal coliforms were total-P and total-N, and heterotrophic bacteria density was identified as a good parameter to differentiate the ecosystems. These results suggested the inclusion of the trophic level and the distinct activities within a watershed as important elements when proposing conservation and restoration areas.					; Barbosa, Francisco/M-6225-2019; Petrucio, Mauricio/AAC-6232-2019	Barbosa, Francisco Antonio/0000-0002-2026-6936; Rosa, Carlos/0000-0002-0056-9075; Petrucio, Mauricio/0000-0002-7242-9426													1516-8913	1678-4324					2005	48	4					625	633		10.1590/S1516-89132005000500015	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1516-89132005000500015													WOS:000231670600015

Diet composition was fairly uniform throughout the day but changed substantially over the seasons. The fish fed opportunistically; differences between seasons reflected changes in prey availability. During the intensive feeding and growing period (May-September), fish were found in the upper 20 m of the lake feeding primarily on cladocerans. Large and non-evasive species, Daphnia spp. and Bythotrephes longimanus, were the most numerous and frequent organisms in the diet during the major part of the growing season. Smaller (Bosmina spp.) as well as evasive species (cyclopoid copepods) were consumed in large numbers when larger, non-evasive species were rare in the lake. The fish showed strong preference for the least abundant crustacean, B. longimanus, while the most abundant crustaceans, calanoid copepods, were rare in the diet. The fish not only selected particular species but, within each species, selected the larger individuals. Diel vertical migration of the prey items in this lake could be, at least in part, attributed to fish predation pressure. The observed selectivity patterns shown by the fish are explained in terms of prey visibility, escape ability, the overlap in distribution of predators and prey in time and space, the profitability of the prey and the present trophic state of the lake.

J	Baird, TA; Acree, MA; Sloan, CL				Baird, TA; Acree, MA; Sloan, CL			Age and gender-related differences in the social behavior and mating success of free-living collared lizards, Crotaphytus collaris	COPEIA												Field studies on collared lizards at Lake Arcadia Dam, Edmond, Oklahoma, revealed that the social and spatial behavior of individuals differed depending on gender and male age. Body size measurements of known lizards over a three-year period revealed that females greater than or equal to 70 mm SVL at the beginning of the activity season in April become reproductively active in their first year, males greater than or equal to 100 mm in April are two years and older (adults), whereas smaller males (60-90 mm) are in their first full year (yearlings). Experimental introduction of female intruders onto occupied female home ranges elicited aggression in four of 17 trials. However, female home ranges overlapped one another greatly, and intrasexual female aggression occurred infrequently These results suggest that female collared lizards at Arcadia Lake do not defend exclusive territories but that occasional aggression may play some other role in the social relationships among adjacent females. Areas occupied by adjacent adult males overlapped little and were defended against other adult males primarily by high rates of travel punctuated with frequent display. Yearling males occupied nondefended home ranges within adult male territories by adopting subordinate tactics characterized by low rates of display and travel and rapid retreat from adult males. The home ranges of approximately 60% of the females were overlapped by the territory of a single adult male. In cases of multiple adult male overlap, one of the males overlapped a larger percentage of the female home range and interacted more frequently with these females than did the other adult males. Most female home ranges were also overlapped partially by as many as four yearling males. Adult males initiated encounters with females much more frequently than did yearlings, and females were almost always receptive to adult males whereas they more often withdrew from yearling males. Estimates based on the relative frequencies of interactions of females with each overlapping male indicated that annual male mating success was correlated with ape class, snout-vent length, hourly frequency of social acts initiated, and rate of travel, such that mating success of adult males far exceeded that of yearlings. Among adult males alone, one estimate of mating success was weakly correlated only with the number of females on territories. Our results show that, even though male mating success is low during their first year, yearlings remain on adult male territories by adopting subordinate behavior patterns, perhaps because this tactic enhances future opportunities to inherit territories and mates.																			0045-8511					MAY 16	1996		2					336	347																WOS:A1996UM94900008

However, in the lakes studied, speciation was found to be far from thermodynamic equilibrium A Superfund site is a major source of As to the watershed, with the Aberjona River being the main conduit for As found in the Mystic Lakes. Total As concentrations in the water column decrease downstream, from > 100 nM in the Hall's Brook Storage Area (HBSA), where As(III) enters via reducing groundwater, to < 20 nM in the Lower Mystic Lake (LML); the sediments of all the lakes are sinks for As. Biologically mediated reduction, at rates of 0.2-0.5% of the total As day(-1), and methylation, at rates of 0.4-0.6% of the total As day(-1), occur in the mixed layers of these lakes. However, these processes are slow or absent in the hypolimnion, allowing As(V) to accumulate in seasonally anoxic hypolimnetic waters. High micromolar concentrations of As, predominantly As(III) persist in the saline, sulfidic monimolimnion of the LML. The production of As(III) and methylated As species in the water column of these lakes inhibits the removal. of As to the sediments, thereby increasing the mobility of As in this watershed.

Floating gardens, mostly for tomato cultivation, are a unique and profitable method of agriculture used by people living on and around the lake. This study investigated the water quality of Inle Lake and how it has been affected by the different agricultural practices used in tomato cultivation on floating garden beds, by measuring pollution levels. Water samples were collected from the sites representing two types of agricultural practice from four villages. The first was designated as being grown under good agricultural practices (GAP), and the other as under non-good agricultural practices (non-GAP), with this study undertaken during wet season, 2019 and dry season, 2020. Two additional sets of water samples were collected as references. One of these sets was from the center of the lake and the other from an inlet stream to the lake. All water samples were analyzed for physical and chemical properties. The results found that Ca2+, Mg2+ and HCO3- were dominant in the lake surface water. The results showed significant differences in the mean values for some water quality parameters between the GAP and non-GAP of each study sites in both seasons. In particular, nutrient pollution from chemicals such as nitrogen and phosphorus from the non-GAP were significantly higher than those from GAP. Water quality index was calculated to describe the overall quality of lake surface water. It was observed that the water quality was almost threatened in the floating garden areas. In comparison between two practices, the non-GAP gave the higher water quality index value than the GAP. This investigated that poor management of fertilizers usage has had a negative effect on the water quality of the lake. The differences seen in water quality from the GAP and non-GAP areas, point to ways to successfully manage sources of water pollution in order to better conserve the lake by sustainable agricultural production.																			2289-5981	2289-599X				SEP-OCT	2021	17	5					593	608																WOS:000714459600009

Long-Term Assessment of Surface Water Quality in a Highly Managed Estuary Basin	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH												Anthropogenic developments in coastal watersheds cause significant ecological changes to estuaries. Since estuaries respond to inputs on relatively long time scales, robust analyses of long-term data should be employed to account for seasonality, internal cycling, and climatological cycles. This study characterizes the water quality of a highly managed coastal basin, the St. Lucie Estuary Basin, FL, USA, from 1999 to 2019 to detect spatiotemporal differences in the estuary's water quality and its tributaries. The estuary is artificially connected to Lake Okeechobee, so it receives fresh water from an external basin. Monthly water samples collected from November 1999 to October 2019 were assessed using principal component analysis, correlation analysis, and the Seasonal Kendall trend test. Nitrogen, phosphorus, color, total suspended solids, and turbidity concentrations varied seasonally and spatially. Inflows from Lake Okeechobee were characterized by high turbidity, while higher phosphorus concentrations characterized inflows from tributaries within the basin. Differences among tributaries within the basin may be attributed to flow regimes (e.g., significant releases vs. steady flow) and land use (e.g., pasture vs. row crops). Decreasing trends for orthophosphate, total phosphorus, and color and increasing trends for dissolved oxygen were found over the long term. Decreases in nutrient concentrations over time could be due to local mitigation efforts. Understanding the differences in water quality between the tributaries of the St. Lucie Estuary is essential for the overall water quality management of the estuary.					; Melesse, Assefa/F-9931-2013	Price, Rene/0000-0003-1050-7270; Vithanage, Jagath/0000-0002-8469-9618; Moncada, Angelica/0000-0002-6473-6768; Melesse, Assefa/0000-0003-4724-9367														1660-4601				SEP	2021	18	17							9417	10.3390/ijerph18179417	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18179417								34502000					WOS:000694153900001

A total of 710 individuals (male = 392 and female = 318) were collected from the Cochin Estuary having TL and BW ranging from 43.2-93.2 mm and 1.45-13.64 g respectively were used for the study. The von Bertalanffy growth curve showed the growth coefficient (K) and growth performance index (o) were 0.700/year and 3.796 respectively. Natural mortality (M = 1.24/year) of P. maculatus was higher than fishing mortality (F = 0.12/year), and present level of exploitation (E = 0.10) was less than 60% of the predicted maximum exploitation, which indicates that the stock is sustainable under current fishing strategy. There were two recruitment periods per year. Males were predominant in the catches and the overall sex ratio was 1.00:0.81, which significantly deviated from theoretical 1:1 distribution with 55.20% males and 44.80% females. The pattern of gonadosomatic index (GSI) and proportion of mature individuals suggest two peaks in the spawning season of P. maculatus occurred during May to July and October to December. The length at 50% maturity (L-50) for males and females was estimated at 71.00 mm TL and 69.96 mm TL respectively. The absolute fecundity estimates vary between 508 and 830 eggs with an average of 683 and the relative fecundity fluctuated between 69.17 and 108.78 eggs/gram with an average of 89.21. The biological information on growth, mortality, exploitation, spawning season, length at first maturity and fecundity provided in this study will be useful for developing sustainable management practices to conserve this poorly known cichlid species.					; Renjithkumar, Chelapurath Radhakrishnan/AAW-5005-2021	, Renjithkumar/0000-0001-6569-5075; 													0212-5919	2366-1674				OCT	2021	37	2					905	915		10.1007/s41208-021-00322-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s41208-021-00322-3		SEP 2021											WOS:000691955700002

The wetland was operated seasonally in compliance with regulatory requirements to compensate for impacts to stilts, avocets, and other wildlife exposed to elevated selenium concentrations, fluctuating water levels resulting in nest flooding, and high nest-predation rates at the TLDD agricultural drainage evaporation basins. Water supply for the wetland was from low-selenium (typically <2 mu g/L) saline agricultural drainage water, although the facility also had capability to blend and use freshwater and saline supplies. Coincident with wetland construction, 2 evaporation basins totaling 1,174 ha. were physically modified and operated to discourage their use by shorebirds. In the first year of wetland operation (1995), American avocet and black-necked stilt nest construction at the wetland was 17.6 nests/ha. This compares to a preproject (1994) combined density of 1.9 nests/ha at the evaporation basins. From 1995 through 2004, annual nesting attempts by American avocets and black-necked stilts at the wetland averaged 2,896 per year (24.8 nests/ha). American avocets and black-necked stilts represented 91% of the nests observed at the wetland. Over the 10-year monitoring period, nest success at the wetland averaged 82% for American avocets and 75% for black-necked stilts. We estimated nest predation rates at the constructed wetland to be <1%. During the same period, American avocet and black-necked stilt nesting at the evaporation basins declined from 2,266 in 1994 to 9 in 2004. The constructed wetland has proven to be effective in attracting and providing suitable nesting habitat for large numbers of avocets and stilts. Results of this long-term study confirm the validity of management recommendations for American avocets and black-necked stilts and suggest that agricultural drainage can be successfully managed to provide highly productive managed wetlands.																			0022-541X					JAN	2008	72	1					143	151		10.2193/2005-553	http://dx.doi.org/10.2193/2005-553													WOS:000252624700017

Organisms living in interstitial spaces of this zone create a community called hydropsammon. Microzonation and seasonal dynamics of hydropsammon rotifers were studied in psammolittoral of deep, eutrophic Lake Mikolajskie (North-eastern Poland) in 2005. An aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that the top 0.5 cm of bottom sands (=epihydroarenal) plays a role of a transitory microzone between adjacent water layer and a deeper 1.5 cm layer of sands (=endohydroarenal). Sampling cores were taken at a station 1.5 m from water's edge once or twice a month since April till October 2005. Three samples were taken: 5-cm thick water layer (AWL - adjacent water layer), 0.5-cm thick layer of water and sand from the transitory level (EPIH - epihydropsammon) and 2-cm thick slice of sand (ENDOH - endohydropsammon). From 94 species found in the lake 15% were restricted to AWL, 20% to endohydropsammon and only 5% to epihydropsammon. From 57 species found in epihydroarenal 52 (91%) were common with neighboring microlayers, i.e. AWL and endohydroarenal. The highest rotifer densities were noted in the endohydroarenal zone if expressed in area units. However, the rotifer densities in epipsammon if expressed in the same volume of occupied environment were ca 40 times higher than in adjacent water and about twice of those noted in endohydroarenal. This may suggest that epihydroarenal plays a role of both a transitory zone and a refugium for animals from adjacent water layer. Reasons for this phenomenon are still not clear.																			1505-2249						2008	56	2					351	357																WOS:000256959500015
J	Menges, ES; Marks, PL				Menges, Eric S.; Marks, Peter L.			Fire and flood: Why are south-central Florida seasonal ponds treeless?	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												While seasonal ponds in the scrub landscape of the Lake Wales Ridge in south-central Florida are favorable for establishment of small south Florida slash pines (Pinus elliottii var. densa), few seasonal ponds have mature trees. We hypothesize that disturbances (fire and/or flooding) periodically exclude trees from seasonal ponds. We studied the demography of slash pines in relation to water level and fire for a decade from 1992-2001 in four seasonal ponds, two with long and two with short hydroperiods. Seasonal ponds were favorable for pine growth (0.1-0.6 m increase in height annually, growth from grass-stage to one meter in about 7 y) and annual survival (survival generally over 80% in years without fires). Most recruitment (appearance of seedlings in a "grass stage") occurred in drier ponds. Flooding episodes occurred in most years and lasted 3-11 mo. Mortality increased with flooding intensity (summed flooding depth) in 3 of 9 y and was concentrated in pines <1 m tall. Growth rates were unaffected by flooding. A low-intensity prescribed fire created 72% mortality, while a large intense wildfire caused nearly 100% mortality. Although South Florida slash pine can survive short-term flooding and moderately intense fire, both flooding and fire can exclude trees from many seasonal ponds. Fire was a stronger force during our study. Seasonal ponds in south-central Florida are usually treeless not because conditions are generally unfavorable for growth and establishment of south Florida slash pines, but because episodic flooding and fire cause massive mortality of seedling and sapling pines.																			0003-0031	1938-4238				JAN	2008	159	1					8	20		10.1674/0003-0031(2008)159[8:FAFWAS]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1674/0003-0031(2008)159[8:FAFWAS]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000252783900002

Depth profiles of total Hg (HgT) and methylmercury (MeHg) were compared with geochemical and microbiological variables, to identify factors influencing MeHg levels in tailings. HgT and MeHg were highly variable in tailings (0.2-73.5 mol kg(-1) and < dl-56.4 nmol kg(-1), respectively), and were influenced by a complex set of in situ factors. Elevated MeHg was linked with > 5 mu mol kg(-1) Hg(T), organic matter, hydrology, abundance and activity of sulfate reducing bacteria, and demethylation processes. Methylmercury levels in tailings from a wet, bog-like site appeared to undergo seasonal fluctuations, with higher concentrations measured in September and October, and lower concentrations in May. Evaluations of amalgamation tailings should examine MeHg and Hg(T) transport out of low-lying, saturated tailings dumps after snowmelt and major rainfall events, and should take into account the possibility of seasonal variation in MeHg levels in northern regions.

Responses of syrphids, elaterids and bees to single-tree selection harvesting in Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario	CANADIAN FIELD-NATURALIST												The species composition of hoverflies (Syrphidae), click beetles (Elateridae), and bees (Apoidea) was studied to determine whether there was a positive response in these flower-seeking insect groups to gaps in the canopy created through single-tree selection harvesting of Sugar Maple (Acer saccharum) and Yellow Birch (Betula alleghaniensis) in hardwood forests of the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence forest region of Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario. There were significantly more hoverflies and bees collected in forest stands harvested within the previous five years than in wilderness zone (unharvested at least for 40 years) stands or stands harvested 15-20 years previously (old logged stands). Click beetles, especially Selatosomus pulcher (LeConte), were collected most often in old logged stands. Bees and click beetles were collected significantly later in the season in logged than in wilderness zone stands. Malaise traps resulted in higher capture rates for syrphids than pan traps, and only with these higher capture rates did we detect a significant increase in species richness in recently logged stands over that in wilderness stands. Changes in the numbers and phenology of flower-visiting insects may impact on reproductive success of flowering plants of the forest understory and deserves further study.

For a two-year measurement period, a dynamic model of lake water level leads to an accurate determination of the water balance at a daily time step. An isotopic balance model (6180 and 62 H), including the Craig and Gordon evaporation model, has been coupled with the water balance model in order to simulate the evolution of the lake water isotopic composition. We propose that the moisture buildup over the lake surface affects the isotopic balance during the seasonal isotopic enrichment. A mixture between a vapour in isotopic equilibrium with rainfall (75%) and the locally evaporated moisture (25%) provides a good simulation of the lake water isotopic composition.

The total amount of carbon contained in moss and soil layers (to the depth of 50 cm beneath the mineral soil surface) was 7.2 kg m(-2), about 47% of which was in the L and FH horizons of the soil. Soil microbial biomass per dry weight of soil was largest in the L horizon, while the biomass per ground area was largest in the FH horizon. Soil respiration rate, measured using a portable infrared gas analyzer, was highest in the FH horizon, exceeding 50% of the total soil respiration. Low but significant CO2 emission was detected even in deeper soil horizon (E horizon). We also examined the respiration rate of cut roots and the effect of root excision on respiration. The contribution of root respiration to total soil respiration, calculated from root biomass and respiration rate of cut roots, was about 54%. The amount of carbon evolved through microbial respiration during the snow-free season (June-October) was estimated as 221 g C m(-2). Micro-organisms in the L horizon showed high respiratory activity as compared with those in deeper soil horizons.					; Nakatsubo, Takayuki/V-4520-2019	Nakatsubo, Takayuki/0000-0003-3329-0123; 													0912-3814					APR	1998	13	1					17	26		10.1046/j.1440-1703.1998.00244.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1440-1703.1998.00244.x													WOS:000073652300003
J	PLATT, NH; WRIGHT, VP				PLATT, NH; WRIGHT, VP			PALUSTRINE CARBONATES AND THE FLORIDA EVERGLADES - TOWARDS AN EXPOSURE INDEX FOR THE FRESH-WATER ENVIRONMENT	JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY PETROLOGY												Palustrine carbonates are shallow fresh-water deposits showing evidence of subaqueous deposition and subaerial exposure. These facies are common in the geological record. The intensity of modification is highly variable depending on the climate and the length of emergence. Palustrine limestones have previously been interpreted as marginal lacustrine deposits from fluctuating, low-salinity carbonate lakes, but several problems remain with existing facies models: 1) palustrine carbonates possess a lacustrine biota but commonly display fabrics similar to those of calcretes and peritidal carbonates; 2) the co-occurrence of calcrete horizons and karst-like cavities is somewhat unusual and appears to indicate contemporaneous carbonate precipitation and dissolution in the vadose zone; 3) the dominance of gray colors indicates water-saturation, apparently inconsistent with the evidence for strong desiccation overprint; 4) profundal lake deposits are generally absent from palustrine sequences, and sublittoral facies commonly make up only a small proportion of total thicknesses; 5) no good modem analogue has been identified for the palustrine environment. Analogy with the Florida Everglades suggests a re-interpretation of palustrine limestones, not as pedogenically modified lake margin facies but as the deposits of extensive, very shallow carbonate marshes. The distribution of environments in the Everglades is determined by the local hydrology, reflecting the control of seasonal water-level fluctuations and topography. Climate and topography were the main controls on deposition of ancient palustrine carbonates. As in peritidal sequences, aggradational cycles are capped by a range of lithologies (evaporites, desiccation and microkarst breccias, calcretes, lignite or coal horizons etc.), permitting interpretation of the climate. Careful analysis of lateral facies variations may permit reconstruction of subtle topography. Consideration of the Florida Everglades as a modem analogue for the palustrine environment has suggested the development of an exposure index for fresh-water carbonates.					; Platt, Nigel/NAZ-8174-2025	Platt, Nigel H/0000-0002-1131-0704; 													0022-4472					NOV	1992	62	6					1058	1071																WOS:A1992JX76100010
J	Castillo, MM				Castillo, MM			Influence of hydrological seasonality on bacterioplankton in two neotropical floodplain lakes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Seasonal fluctuation in river stage strongly affects the ecological functioning of tropical floodplain lakes. This study was conducted to assess the influence of hydrological seasonality on bacterial production and abundance in two floodplain lakes of the Autana River, a blackwater river in the Middle Orinoco basin, Venezuela. Water samples for nutrient chemistry, chlorophyll a, and microbiological determinations were collected in two floodplain lakes and in the mainstem of the river during 1997-98. DOC and chlorophyll a concentrations were similar between mainstem and lake sites during high water when river and lakes were well connected but became different during the period of low water when the interaction was minimal. Higher values of bacterial production were observed in the floodplain lakes (0.62-1.03 mug C l(-1) h(-1)) compared to the mainstem sites (0.17- 0.19 mug C l(-1) h(-1)) during the period of low water, while during the period of high water river and lake sites showed similar levels (0.04 mug C l(-1) h(-1)). Bacterial numbers followed bacterial production in the floodplain lakes, reaching higher numbers during the period of low water (1.41-2.40 x 10(6) cells ml(-1)). Availability of substrate and inorganic nutrients, pH, and inputs and losses of bacterial cells could be determining the observed seasonal patterns in bacterial production and abundance. The Autana lakes exhibited a strong seasonal pattern in the chemical and biological conditions, showing higher productivity during the lentic phase that lasted between 5 and 6 months.					; Castillo, Maria/D-1759-2013	Castillo Uzcanga, Maria Mercedes/0000-0002-6623-6513; 													0018-8158					OCT	2000	437	1-3					57	69		10.1023/A:1026598123694	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1026598123694													WOS:000165818100003
J	Petterson, G; Odgaard, BV; Renberg, I				Petterson, G; Odgaard, BV; Renberg, I			Image analysis as a method to quantify sediment components	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Varved lake sediments, with their annual to seasonal resolution, have a high potential for inferring past environmental and climatic conditions. To fully utilize the information present in varved records, high-resolution analyses, which often are time-consuming and difficult to perform, are desirable. The investigation reported here aims at (i) developing image analysis as a method for estimating annual accumulation rates of sediment components such as minerogenic matter, organic matter and biogenic silica, and (ii) assessing the relative importance of these components for changes in varve thickness. Image analysis was used to digitize the grey-scale variations and to measure the varve thickness of 540 varves (476-1015 AD) from Lake Kassjon in northern Sweden. From the 35 cm long digitized sediment sequence, 108 consecutive five-year samples were cut out quantitatively, and relationships between grey-scale variations and sediment dry mass and individual sediment components were assessed. There is a strong correlation between corrected grey-scale (i.e. the product of grey-scale and varve thickness) and the dry mass accumulation rate (r = 0.90, p < 0.001). With a stepwise multiple regression a significant model (R-2 = 0.81) between corrected grey-scale and the accumulation rates of minerogenic matter (r = 0.90, p < 0.001) and biogenic silica (r = 0.26, p < 0.012) was obtained. Considering the minor contribution and weak significance of biogenic silica, image analysis can be used as a fast and non-destructive method to infer past annual accumulation rates of dry mass and minerogenic matter in Kassibn. The model of the relationship between changes in varve thickness, and water content and accumulation rates of sediment components has little predictive power (R-2 = 0.45). The result shows that the varve thickness in Kassjon, at least during the period 476-1015 AD, is not determined by a single sediment component but partly depends on interactions between the major sediment components.

J	Nagelkerke, LAJ; Sibbing, FA				Nagelkerke, LAJ; Sibbing, FA			Reproductive segregation among the Barbus intermedius complex of Lake Tana, Ethiopia. An example of intralacustrine speciation?	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Reproductive segregation among the large barbs Barbus intermedius complex, Cyprinidae, of Lake Tana, Ethiopia, was investigated in the mouths and upstream reaches of rivers tributary to the lake, during the spawning seasons of 1993 and 1994. The percentage of running fish of four Barbus morphotypes [Acute (Ac), Bigmouth big-eye (Be), Intermedius (In), and Shorthead (Sh)] peaks with the highest water level of the lake. Large differences are apparent in the minimum fork length of running fish among morphotypes [c. 12 cm for male Sh and 28 cm for male Bigmouth small-eye (Se)]. Significant differences occur in temporal, but especially in spatial patterns of the relative abundance of running morphotypes, when the lake is compared with the four major river mouths and their upstream reaches. These different relative abundances are dearest among Ac, Be, In, Sh and Troutlike (Tr). Also, the absence from the rivers of some morphotypes that are usually abundant in the lake itself [Barbel (Ba), Dark (Da), Lip (Li), and Zurki (Zu)], and the abundant presence in the rivers of Tr, rare in the lake, strengthen the hypothesis that spatial and/or temporal spawning segregation is present among the morphotypes. There are indications that Bighead (Bh) and Zu spawn in the lake itself, while other morphotypes were only found running in or near rivers. Combined with the morphological, ecological, and genetic differences, these data suggest the existence of several Barbus species, forming a unique species flock, which probably evolved within the lake. The presence of several, instead of one Barbus species complicates management of sustainable fisheries and protection of the lake's biodiversity. Present results show the importance of the rivers for Barbus reproduction and stress the urgent need for careful management of fishing activities in spawning times and areas.

By 1980, the diversity of trees on all but one of these islands was far lower than on mainland plots of comparable size. A restricted subset of tree species has spread on these islands, notably Protium panamense, Scheelea zonensis, Oenocarpus panamanus and Swartzia simplex. We constructed a null model to predict how chance would change tree diversity and the similarity of tree species compositions of different islands, assuming that each mature tree has equal chances of dying and/or reproducing, regardless of its species. This model cannot account for the diminished diversity of the changes in vegetation on these islands: some factors must be favoring a particular set of tree species. Two factors, exposure to wind and absence of mammals, seem needed to bring about the vegetation changes observed on these small islands. Their vegetation shows many signs of wind damage and of adaptation to resist wind, reflecting its exposure to dry season winds and storm winds sweeping across the lake from the west. Their most common tree species appear to have spread because mammals rarely visit these small and isolated islands. Seed of these common species are normally much eaten by mammals and do not need burial by mammals to escape insect attack. A thorough grasp of plant-animal interactions is needed to understand the events that have taken place on these islands. Identifying those 'keystone animals' essential for maintaining plant diversity is a necessary element of reserve design and forest management in the tropics.

Moderate spatial resolution remote sensing instruments, which have (near) daily repeat intervals, but contain less detailed spectral and spatial information, have been employed much less frequently in archaeology. However, moderate remote sensing data offer distinct advantages for archaeological research as they can be used to relate archaeological, ecological, and climactic data at vast spatial scales. To show this potential, we use moderate remote sensing data to examine the impact of landscape heterogeneity on the spread of indigenous maize horticulture in the northern Great Lakes during Late Precontact (ca. AD 12001600). Analyzing National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery, we identify differences in freeze/thaw cycles across inland lakes in Michigan, showing that some large inland lakes produce a microclimatic amelioration, possibly extending the growing season for prehistoric maize cultivation. Conducting geospatial analyses, we find that burial mounds and maize cultivation practices were associated preferentially with larger inland lakes with microclimates. We could not have found these dynamic interrelationships between microclimates, burial mounds, and maize cultivation if not for both the frequent temporal imaging and large spatial coverage provided by moderate resolution remote sensing imagery.

Characterization of the diatom flora in the Lower Mountain Fork (Oklahoma, USA), a novel regulated river with a disjunct population of the diatom Didymosphenia geminata (Bacillariophyta)	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												Regulated rivers are novel ecosystems with altered temperature and flow regimes that can be used to test distribution patterns of microscopic organisms, such as diatoms. Our objective was to describe the spatial and seasonal patterns of diatoms in a cold-water, oligotrophic river within a region of warm-water, mesotrophic rivers. The Lower Mountain Fork, in south-east Oklahoma (USA), is maintained as a year-around, stocked fishery by the release of cold, hypolimnetic water from Broken Bow Lake and is the southern-most known site of Didymosphenia geminata in North America. Epilithic diatoms were sampled six times at nine sites over a distance of 15.5 km and, within this area, 27 times at the site of the main Didymosphenia bloom. Percentage composition data were analysed for assemblage composition using multivariate analysis, nutrient specificity using a diatom-based metric, and species associations using similarity profiles. Eighty-eight taxa were found, of which 10 were unidentifiable and included local undescribed species and species clusters. Three species [Gomphonema (parvulum morph), Achnanthidium rivulare and Achnanthidium minutissimum] comprised over 60% of the diatom abundance at all sites, and downstream and seasonal patterns were evident for both these and less abundant taxa. Notably, diatom assemblages in the three sites below the dam were similar to that at the lowermost site, below a much smaller dam. The oligotraphentic diatom assemblage reflected the water chemistry of the river. The Didymosphenia bloom had been scoured by a large spate prior to the study and the species was present at two of the nine sites in low numbers but failed to bloom during the study, possibly because of a trend towards increasing phosphorus concentrations in the reservoir (Didymosphenia blooms under low P concentrations). No other species shared Didymosphenia's distribution pattern over the study reach, highlighting the novelty of Didymosphenia's presence in the river.					; Desianti, Nina/AAH-2185-2020	Cooper, Joshua/0000-0001-6355-4420; Bergey, Elizabeth/0000-0002-7160-6590; 													0967-0262	1469-4433				MAY	2017	52	2					225	237		10.1080/09670262.2016.1266035	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09670262.2016.1266035													WOS:000399647500008

Chemicals investigated were: alfa-hexachlorocyclohexane (a-HCH); beta-hexachlorocyclohexane (beta-HCH); gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (gamma-HCH); delta-hexachlorocyclohexane (delta-HCH); Heptachlor; Heptachlor epoxide; Aldrin; Dieldrin; Endosulfan I; Endosulfan II; 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2 his (p-chlorophenyl) ethane (p,p' DDT; 1,1-dichloro-2,2 bis (p-chlorophenyl) ethylene (p-p'DDE); 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis (p,p'-chlorophenyl) ethane (p-p'DDD); 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis-(o,p'-chlorophenyl) ethane (o-p'DDD); Methoxychlor; Endrin. Concentrations found for beta-HCH and Dieldrin were above the maximum permissible values recommended by international organizations (E.C. Council Directive 1980). Mean values found in positive samples were 14.20 mug/L (0.01-208.10) and 9.35 mug/L (0.07 -145.00) for beta-HCH and Dieldrin, respectively. For a total number of 314 samples, the percentage of positive samples ranged from 68.6 % for Heptachlor to 16 % for Aldrin. Concentration values and the percentage of positive samples in ground water were significantly lower than those found in surface water. In some surface samples, the values were higher than the allowed maximum (1 to 3 mug/L). Samples taken in different seasons did not show significant differences.																			0717-9324					JUN	2003	48	2					7	12																WOS:000183467400001

A previously published paper presented the experimental design and baseline data for humans and bovines. This paper presents basic data for the four villages using remote sensing, and baseline data for snails that includes geographic information systems and remote sensing technology to classify the areas of bovine grazing ranges and habitats suitable for snails. A new method for sampling Oncomelania snails in China is used to determine the distribution, density, and infection rates of snails throughout the grazing ranges from season to season over a four-year period. Hypothetically, treating bovines should reduce infection rates in snails to below the critical number necessary to maintain infections in man and bovines.					sleigh, adrian/J-4540-2019; Lin, Dandan/GRJ-2233-2022; Williams, Gail/S-8833-2019; McManus, Don/AAC-5394-2020	Williams, Gail/0000-0002-4822-5263; Sleigh, Adrian/0000-0001-8443-7864; McManus, Donald/0000-0001-6443-1449													0002-9637					APR	2002	66	4					359	371		10.4269/ajtmh.2002.66.359	http://dx.doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.2002.66.359								12164289					WOS:000177062400005
J	Kowalski, KP; Wilcox, DA				Kowalski, KP; Wilcox, DA			Differences in sedge fen vegetation upstream and downstream from a managed impoundment	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed the restoration of wetlands impacted by a series of drainage ditches and pools located in an extensive undeveloped peatland in the Seney National Wildlife Refuge, Michigan. This study examined the nature and extent of degradation to the Marsh Creek wetlands caused by alteration of natural hydrology by a water-storage pool (C-3 Pool) that intersects the Marsh Creek channel. We tested the hypothesis that a reduction in moderate-intensity disturbance associated with natural water-level fluctuations below the C-3 dike contributed to lower species richness, reduced floristic quality and a larger tree and shrub component than vegetation upstream from the pool. Wetland plant communities were sampled quantitatively and analyzed for species richness, floristic quality and physiognomy. Aerial photographs, GIS databases and GPS data contributed to the characterization and analysis of the Marsh Creek wetlands. Results showed that there was lower species richness in vegetated areas downstream from the pool, but not the anticipated growth in shrubs. Wetland vegetation upstream and downstream from the pool had similar floristic quality, except for a greater number of weedy taxa above the pool. Seepage through the pool dike and localized ground-water discharge created conditions very similar to those observed around beaver dams in Marsh Creek. In essence, the dike containing the C-3 Pool affected hydrology and wetland plant communities in a manner similar to an enormous beaver dam, except that it did not allow seasonal flooding episodes to occur. Management actions to release water from the pool into the original Marsh Creek channel at certain times and in certain amounts that mimic the natural flow regime would be expected to promote greater plant species richness and minimize the negative impacts of the dike.

Theoretically, this might lead to a competitive elimination of either one but there are multispecies temporal larval communities persisting over the years. We hypothesized that larvae of two common European anuran species segregate their trophic niches despite their omnivorous habits and possible similarity of trophic levels. We assessed interspecific differences in food assimilation at larval and postmetamorphic stages of two anurans in an ecosystem of forest lake and an adjacent terrestrial ecosystem using a stable isotope approach. Trophic level of tadpoles of both species corresponded to those of some benthic invertebrate predators. Trophic positions of postmetamorphic juveniles corresponded to those of terrestrial invertebrate predators. The unpredictable decrease of delta N-15 values in anuran tissues during the transition from aquatic to terrestrial habitats corresponded to the differences between aquatic and terrestrial isotopic baselines whereas dynamics of normalized delta N-15 confirmed an increase in their trophic level. Finally, we detected a strong segregation of trophic niches of the two species at both larval and postmetamorphic stages. The described niche separation provides an important prerequisite for decreasing possible intraspecific competition and promoting long-term co-existence of these syntopic anurans.

J	Krivtsov, V; Sigee, DC				Krivtsov, V; Sigee, DC			Importance of biological and abiotic factors for geochemical cycling in a freshwater eutrophic lake	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Here we report the results of a comprehensive biogeochemical monitoring of Rostherne Mere in 1998, including changes in dissolved oxygen, organic carbon and nitrogen, nitrate/nitrite, ammonia, Al, Na, S, K, Mg, Ca, Si, Fe, Mn, orthophosphate, particulate N & P, suspended solids, temperature, pH, chiorophyll-a and zooplankton. The results demonstrated the major influence of primary producers on the overall geochemical cycling of N, P and Si, and suggested that the significance of zooplankton might have been previously underestimated. For major anions and cations, however, the influence of biota on lake water concentrations appeared to be negligible, reflecting the fact that these chemicals were present far in excess of plankton requirements. Thus changes in concentrations of Ca, K, Na, Mg and S were rather limited and must have reflected changes in hydrological and meteorological parameters. K, however, demonstrated a transitional pattern, reflecting some influence of biological uptake. During the stratification period, the slow processes of bacteria] decomposition in the hypolimnion gradually released chemicals contained in the materials accumulated in the bottom layer, remarkably increasing the concentrations of dissolved compounds of those elements present in amounts comparable with the pool stored in the sedimenting detritus (e.g. orthophosphate P, ammonia N, Si and DOC). The decomposition also resulted in a drop in the redox potential, followed by partial denitrification and chemical release from the sediments. The hypolimnion of the Mere was confirmed to remain at the stage of Mn release, characterised by accumulation of DOC, orthophosphates, ammonia and initial stages of denitrification. High levels of P released from the sediments during the stratification period suggest that the lake's recovery after sewage diversion might be further delayed.

J	Lombardo, P				Lombardo, P			Applicability of littoral food-web biomanipulation for lake management purposes: Snails, macrophytes, and water transparency in northeast Ohio shallow lakes	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Seven shallow-to-intennediate-depth, meso-eutrophic lakes in northeast Ohio were surveyed July-August 1998 to evaluate a macrophyte-based littoral food-web (and its possible manipulation) role in increasing or maintaining water transparency. Macrophyte and periphyton growth were determined from pre-weighed C demersum sprigs and biomass developed on glass tiles, respectively; littoral snail densities were estimated from assemblages in large-mesh cages at 1-m depth. Other variables were monitored weekly in situ. Lakes were generally phosphorus (P)-limited, but differed significantly in perceived state (turbid, stable or unstable clear-water), water transparency (SD), total phosphorus (TP) and chlorophyll a concentration (chla), vegetation cover (VC), snail density, sprig growth and periphyton biomass. The most richly vegetated lake was also the most stable (seasonally and long-term) clear-water lake, but midsummer SD was more strongly correlated with watershed:lake surface area. C demersum growth was negatively correlated with periphyton biomass; meristem production was lower in turbid lakes, but was influenced by TP. Snail abundance tended to follow food (periphyton) and substrate (VC) availability, but was lower in crayfish-present lakes. Correlations between lake-describing variables were nonlinear with frequent outliers. When integrated with information from the literature, the results suggest that littoral food-web biomanipulation may be employed as a management technique in some cases. More often, macrophytes and the macrophyte-driven, snail-mediated clear-water stable state may (re)establish naturally in suitable lakes after conditions are brought above a "threshold" for plant growth. Frequent exceptions in observed patterns in this study and elsewhere suggest that applicability of littoral food-web biomanipulation should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

The purpose of this study was to determine the hydrodynamic and ecological responses of the system to short forcing events such as strong winds or flood, when the 1-D assumption is no longer valid. To reach this goal, we developed a 3-D ecological model that describes the biogeochemical processes in the lake and the sedimentary transport. It was applied on the lake Burragorang (near Sydney, Australia). Results show that for wind events, lateral heterogeneities may be as strong as in the vertical direction. Ir there are major hydrodynamic influences on the ecosystem behavior, living communities responses seem to be very quick. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Sediment samples were collected at different locations from Kolleru Lake at different seasons in a year over a period of three years and analyzed for eight selected pesticides. In general, pesticides were present at all locations. The selected pesticides alpha -BHC, gamma -BHC, malathion, chlorpyrifos and endosulfan were present at higher concentrations than isodrin, dieldrin and p,p'-DDT. The concentrations of alpha -BHC, gamma -BHC malathion, chlorpyrifos, isodrin, endosulfan, dieldrin and p,p'-DDT in sediments were 1.2-388, 1.4-212, from below the minimum detection limit (BDL)-186, 1.1-292, BDL-38.6, BDL-206, BDL-128 and BDL-191 mu gkg(-1) dry weight, respectively. The aim of this study is to evaluate baseline data, to try to account for the concentration of pesticides in sediments and to discuss their potential to affect human beings and aquatic organisms.

Yet, the recovery of aquatic systems is usually focused only on nutrient management. In our work, we presented the case of an urban and hypereutrophic environment (Pampulha reservoir, Belo Horizonte, Brazil) that receives discharges from several streams and was treated with lanthanum modified bentonite (Phoslock (R)) and microbial bioremediation (Enzilimp (R)). Our goals were to evaluate whether the treatment could improve the water quality and characterize the spatiotemporal variation of dissolved organic matter sources and indices according to absorbance and fluorescence measurements from the reservoir and streams post-application months (2018). In our results, the reservoir showed a relative decrease in its phosphorus concentration compared to data from before the treatment. On the other hand, carbon concentrations reached expressive values in the post-application months following a similar pattern found in the streams. Our data showed that the reservoir's high resistance in its hypereutrophic condition was related to the elevated loading of external inputs coming from the streams. The parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) identified four main carbon sources, two of them being potential tracers of organic pollution in the Pampulha reservoir and watershed, together with absorbance and fluorescence indices. Our findings suggest that carbon parameters can be essential tools to provide adequate monitoring and optimization of water recovery attempts in complex, polluted environments.

Methylmercury in lake bed soils during re-flooding of an Appalachian reservoir in the northeastern USA	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS												Mercury methylation, where inorganic mercury (Hg) is converted to methylmercury (MeHg), can increase in soils when flooded. While effects of the initial flooding of soils on MeHg production have been well studied, less is known about impacts of re-flooding on MeHg production. Lake Perez, an impounded recreational reservoir in the Appalachian Highlands, was completely drained then re-filled 7 years later. We use a combination of chemical, soil physical, and microbial data to quantify changes in MeHg before and after re-flooding of the lakebed. Portions that were transiently saturated due to pluvial flooding had the highest pre-flooded MeHg concentrations. When the lake was re-flooded, concentrations of MeHg in subaqueous soils increased by a factor of 2.74 (+174%) on average. Substantial variability was observed among the sampling sites, with smaller increases in MeHg at sites subjected to seasonal flooding during periods when the reservoir was drained. The increase of soil MeHg after re-flooding was lower in this study compared to studies that evaluated soil MeHg after initial flooding, indicating that re-flooding of a former lake bed caused a smaller response in MeHg production compared to initial flooding of terrestrial land. This study advances understanding of the environmental impact of impounded reservoirs.

Both species used braided channel/backwater habitats for feeding more than expected, based on availability, and open pool and main navigation channel less than expected. Most individuals of both species fed <5 km from their breeding colony and avoided sites >10 km away. Habitat and distance need to be considered simultaneously when assessing habitat quality for herons and egrets. The Great Blue Heron flew farther to feeding sites during the care-of-young period than during incubation and the Great Egret showed the opposite pattern. The Great Blue Heron tended to feed solitarily; only 10% of the feeding flights ended at a location where another heron was already present. About one-third of Great Egret feeding flights ended at a location with another egret already present. Colony placement on the landscape seemed to be a function of the feeding radius of each colony.

Lake Pikrolimni is located in the basin of Kilkis plain, northern Greece, formed in a shallow depression. Lake Pikrolimni is not fed by any major river, and the hydrography of the area shows that no perennial streams enter the lake directly. In the past, the major source of water to the lake was ground water. Today the dominant inflow to Lake Pikrolimni is meteoric water. The meteoric origin of the water is one of the necessary geochemical conditions that are indispensable and responsible for the formation of carbonate-bicarbonate sodium (Natron, Trona) minerals. Pikrolimni brines lie on an evaporation trend given by delta D = 4.74 parts per thousand and delta O-18 = -13.38 parts per thousand. Both isotopic values (delta O-18 and delta D) increase with salinity, which in turn varies considerably with flooding and evaporation. In dry seasons, part of the lake is desiccated and the margins are locally covered by salts, including Na-carbonate-bicarbonate minerals, Na-sulfate and Na-chloride minerals. These minerals are submitted to repeated wetting and drying cycles under alkaline and strong evaporating conditions. This salt dissolution is reflected in Cl/Br ratios of Pikrolimni water.

Tracking of 241 adult sockeye salmon to 27 spawning locations revealed both essential habitats and the relationship between spawn timing and seasonal turbidity cycles. Sixty-six percent of radio-tagged sockeye salmon spawned in turbid waters (>= 5 nephelometric turbidity units) where visual observation was difficult. Spawning in turbid habitats coincided with seasonal temperature declines and associated declines in turbidity and suspended sediment concentration. Because spawn timing is heritable and influenced by temperature, the observed behavior suggests an adaptive response to glacier-fed habitats, as it would reduce embryonic exposure to the adverse effects of fine sediments.

Here we report on breeding condition and copulation of otters in June from Yellowstone Lake in Yellowstone National Park.

J	OLSON, MS; PLATT, WJ				OLSON, MS; PLATT, WJ			EFFECTS OF HABITAT AND GROWING-SEASON FIRES ON RESPROUTING OF SHRUBS IN LONGLEAF PINE SAVANNAS	VEGETATIO												The effects of habitat and timing of growing season fires on resprouting of shrubs were studied in second-growth longleaf pine savannas of the west Gulf coastal plain in the southeastern United States. Within the headwaters of three different drainages of the Calcasieu River in the Kisatchie National Forest in western Louisiana, replicated permanent transects were established that extended from xeric upland longleaf pine savannas into downslope hydric seepage savannas. All shrubs were mapped and tagged, and numbers of stems were counted prior to any fires. Replicated prescribed fires were set early (June) and late (August) during the 1990 growing season; maximum fire temperatures were measured within both upland and seepage habitats within each transect. Shrubs were relocated; stems were recensused two and twelve months after the fires. At least some shrubs of all species resprouted from underground organs; none regenerated solely from seed banks in the soil. There was no reduction in total numbers of stems one year after fires compared to before fires, either in the upland or in seepage savannas. In addition, there was no reduction in total numbers of stems one year after early or late growing season fires. Fire-related mortality was restricted to small shrubs (< 18 stems) and was not associated with high fire temperatures. The rate of resprouting varied among species and between habitats. Resprouting occurred more rapidly in seepage than upland savannas, but more resprouts were produced in upland than seepage savannas one year after fires. In contrast to other upland species, Vaccinium arboreum and V. elliottii delayed resprouting more than two months following fire. Stems of Rhus copallina and Pyrus arbutifolia, species with long rhizomes, increased more after fires in June than fires in August. We suggest that growing season fires may block further recruitment of shrubs into longleaf pine savannas, but reduction in numbers of large shrubs may require additional management.																			0042-3106					AUG	1995	119	2					101	118		10.1007/BF00045593	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00045593													WOS:A1995TA07700002

Microcystins (MC) have become common potential hazardous pollutant in aquatic environments for their great toxicity, widespread distribution and structural stability. These toxin, producing mainly by Microcystis, are family of monocyclic heptapeptides with many different isomerides. On the basis of the recent development of pollution status of microcystins and their ecotoxicological studies on aquatic organisms, we introduce the physicochemical properties and the fate of microcystins, their pollution in natural waters, reservoir water and potable water in China and their accumulation in some aquatic products, summarize the molecular toxicity mechanisms and their ecotoxicological effects on common aquatic plants and fishes which are the important components of aquatic ecosystem. Finally, the main research trend in this area are discussed.

As the only intermediate host of schistosomiasis, Oncomelania's breeding and distribution influence the prevalence and transmission of schistosomiasis directly. The cercaria of Schistosoma has a significant seasonal variation in Poyang Lake. This paper selects molluscicidal Oncomelania statistics, temperature, and precipitation of eight epidemics of schistosomiases in Poyang Lake. It constructs schistosomiasis transmission index prediction model of Poyang Lake to predict the propagation of Schistosomiasis. It analyzes the spatial variation of Oncomelania islet making use of Theil coefficient. Then, it analyzes the epidemic of Schistosomiasis spatial and temporal distribution features making use of GIS, Excel and SPSS in Poyang Lake based on climate changes. The results have shown that, the rapid increase of population in epidemic is not only related to the change of temperature and precipitation in each county, but also related to temperature positively and precipitation inversely in Poyang Lake. The transmission of Schistosomiasis is not only of great differences in time but also in scale with large district and spatial variation in Poyang Lake Region. Appropriate habitat of Oncomelania and schistosoma has been moving northward, which maybe result in the transmission of schistosomiasis moving northward. Further impacts on the epidemic situation of schistosomiasis spread in Poyang Lake Region. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In some years, floods are much more severe than others; in particular, when there is a combination of high discharge from upstream and a high run-off from rainfall within the area. Actions taken by villagers could help build resilience at household and community levels against these more serious floods and thus reduce the risks of disasters, loss of life, and costly damage. In a detailed study of impacts and responses to floods in Angkor Ang village in Prey Veng Province, we found evidence of major barriers to effective actions by villagers and other actors working at community and other levels. Building and maintaining resilience in flood-prone communities requires that attention be given to local capacity and knowledge, differences in wealth or poverty, gender relations, and local participation. Moreover, these factors need to be examined in various social processes before, during, and after major floods.																			1574-0919		978-94-007-0933-1				2011	45						241	+		10.1007/978-94-007-0934-8_14	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-0934-8_14													WOS:000291707200014

The effect of sampling scales on the interpretation of environmental drivers of the cyanotoxin microcystin	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Tillmanns AR, Pick FR. 2011. The effect of sampling scales on the interpretation of environmental drivers of the cyanotoxin microcystin. Lake Reserv Manage. 27: 183-193. Microcystins (MC), a class of cyanobacterial toxins, were measured in one shallow moderately eutrophic lake over 3 years and compared with results from multi-lake regional studies taken from the literature to understand how the choice of sampling regime affects observed correlations between microcystins and environmental conditions. Our results show that correlations between MC seston content and environmental factors are quite dependent upon the temporal sampling scale. The within-year variation in total MC seston content was high, almost an order of magnitude higher than that of the abiotic variables measured and that of algal biomass (Chl-a) but similar to the variation in the density of cladoceran zooplankton. At the temporal scale of seasons, no significant correlations could be detected between MC seston content and environmental variables, but at the monthly scale, pH and temperature were positively correlated with MC seston content. At the weekly scale, reactive phosphate was weakly correlated with MC seston content (with a lag of 12 d) as detected through time series analysis. Furthermore, the factors previously associated with microcystins at a larger spatial scale in among-lake studies (namely total phosphorus, total nitrogen, and light attenuation) did not explain the temporal MC seston content variation within one lake at any sampling scale.

Methods: Rat Sertoli cells were isolated and cultured. Purity of extracted Sertoli cells was identified by Feulgen staining method. Viability of primary rat Sertoli cells and the maximum dose of non-cytotoxicity of MC-LR on Sertoli cells were ascertained with MTT method after the cells were treated with the different concentrations of MC-LR for 24h. LDH, MDA, SOD, ROS in Sertoli cells were analyzed after Sertoli cells were cultured with different concentrations (0 mu g/L, 0.15 mu g/L, 1.5 mu g/L, 15 mu g/L) of MC-LR for 6, 12, 24h,. Results: The Sertoli cells model was obtained to study the toxic effects of MC-LR. The highest non-toxicity concentration of MC-LR was 15 mu g/L. The level of ROS in cells increased after exposed to the different concentrations of MC-LR, and there was a statistically significant difference when cells were exposed to 15g/L compared to control cells(P<0.05). There was no statistically significant difference of MDA between control cells and cells exposed to MC-LR (P>0.05). The changes of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage amount were not significant after cells were cultured with the different concentration of MC-LR (P>0.05). The decreases of superoxide dismutase (SOD) were found to be dependent on the dose (P<0.05). Conclusion: MC-LR caused change of ROS in this study, but it had no effects on MDA. MC-LR had no effects on leakage rate of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) but enhanced the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD). The results suggested that MC-LR can induce oxidative stress in primary cultured rat Sertoli cell, but can not lead to lipid peroxidation.

Use of artificial-substrate samplers to identify relations between periphytic diatom community composition and hydro-limnological conditions in shallow lakes of Old Crow Flats, Yukon Territory (Canada)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Concern over effects of climate warming on shallow northern lakes elicits need for agency-led, long-term, biomonitoring programs to implement protocols applicable across large, remote landscapes. Here, we analyze composition of periphytic diatom communities accrued on artificial-substrate samplers in 33 and 48 lakes spanning broad hydrological gradients of the lake-rich Old Crow Flats (Yukon, Canada) during ice-free seasons of 2008 and 2009, respectively, to explore the ability of this approach to discern ecological responses to differences in basin hydrology and water chemistry. Multivariate analyses demonstrate water chemistry and periphytic diatom community composition differ among three isotope-defined hydrological lake categories (snowmelt-dominated, rainfall-dominated, intermediate). Some snowmelt-dominated lakes support moderate percent abundances of Rossithidium pusilla, Sellaphora laevissima, Tabellaria flocculosa str. III and T. fenestrata, associated with relatively high concentrations of major nutrients and DOC. Rainfall-dominated lakes have higher pH and ion content, yet diatom composition overlapped extensively with intermediate and snowmelt-dominated lakes. Water chemistry and diatom community composition did not differ between study years, despite almost four-fold greater snowfall in 2009. Thus, periphytic diatom communities on artificial-substrate samplers capture ecological differences across hydro-limnological gradients of Old Crow Flats, but longer time-series of data are required to assess their ability to track temporal responses to hydro-climatic variation.					; Hall, Roland/K-3165-2019	Hall, Roland/0000-0002-0314-6449; Mohammed, Wathiq/0000-0002-3084-1148; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV	2021	848	19					4551	4567		10.1007/s10750-021-04661-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-021-04661-3		JUL 2021											WOS:000675759600003
J	Krause, C; Wörz, A; Thiv, M				Krause, Cornelia; Woerz, Arno; Thiv, Mike			Molecular analysis of the extinct Central European endemic Saxifraga oppositifolia subsp amphibia and its implications on glaciation biogeography	ALPINE BOTANY												Extinction of biodiversity due to human activities is a severe global problem. In Europe, however, only a few plant species died out so far. We investigated a dubious, disregarded taxon-Saxifraga oppositifolia subsp. amphibia-which became extinct in the 1960s. It exclusively occurred in a specific niche, namely in seasonally flooded waterside bank vegetation around Lake Constance in Germany and Switzerland. It has either been interpreted as a glacial relict or as a recent dealpine taxon. Using herbarium material, we conducted phylogenetic analyses based on ITS and cpDNA sequence variation. The taxon shared a chloroplast haplotype of S. oppositifolia, which is mainly distributed in the Alps, favouring the dealpine hypothesis. Nuclear data revealed several paralogous copies nested inside S. oppositifolia, most of which, however, differed from other S. oppositifolia accessions including those from the vicinity of Lake Constance. The oldest mean stem node ages of these ITS copies date between 0.91 and 0.28 my. Contradicting cpDNA, this may indicate that this saxifrage was a distinct taxon and possibly a relict originating in Middle Pleistocene glaciations. If so, the present study exemplifies that arctic-alpine plants survived in specific niches at low altitudes during interglacials and that corresponding taxa with a limited distribution are especially prone to extinction.					; Krause, Cornelia/P-6049-2014	Krause, Cornelia/0000-0002-7886-3629; 													1664-2201	1664-221X				APR	2017	127	1					85	95		10.1007/s00035-016-0183-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00035-016-0183-5													WOS:000398467800008

The aim of the research was to determine interactively total metals available in the waters of the inner Puno bay of Lake Titicaca, Peru. It was conducted between January and November 2016 by a non-probabilistic for convenience and applying the theoretical method by comparison among six stations of selection. Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd, As, Hg were the determined and quantified elements using atomic absorption spectrometry by inductively coupled plasma with axial view (ICP-AES). It was observed that between the stations there were no statistically significant differences (p <= 0.05) when there was an availability of exposure among all the elements, although when comparing each element per station, there were differences for the rainy (January-February-March) and dry season (September-October-November). By comparing each station and between seasons, we found that there was no statistically significant difference, although the higher concentration levels were for the dryness season. We conclude that there is environmental exposure by metals in the waters of the Inner Bay and where their concentrations are permanent during the whole period of the year, being able to bring negative consequences not only for the ecosystem, but also to the human health itself given activities of community benefit that are developed in this geographic space.

J	Heitz-Weniger, A				Heitz-Weniger, Annekaethi			Palynological investigations at the Late Bronze-Early Iron Age lakeshore settlement of Luokesa 1 (Moletai District, Lithuania): a contribution to the Middle-Late Holocene vegetation history of the south-eastern Baltic regions	VEGETATION HISTORY AND ARCHAEOBOTANY												Today, the settlement site of Luokesa 1 (L1) lies under water at the northern edge of Lake Luokesa in the Baltic Uplands, south-eastern Lithuania. Its 60 cm-thick Late Bronze-Early Iron Age cultural layer lies on top of lake marl. During excavations in 2008 and 2009, core samples at L1 were taken for the purpose of multidisciplinary investigations. From this material, five on-site pollen diagrams were created in parallel with geo-archaeological investigations and the examination of the botanical macro-remains. Two of these cores mainly comprised the cultural layer, another two consisted largely of the underlying lake marl and the fifth contained primarily the transition from the lake marl to the cultural layer. The chronological sequence was established through 11 AMS dates. The woodland history, starting from the Late Atlantic period, was recorded. The Quercetum mixtum values are quite low in the Subboreal, with the coniferous forest consisting mainly of Pinus and, though significantly less, Picea. At the transition to the cultural layer (Subatlantic) the pollen curves are highly variable, showing peaks in the curves for Betula and Alnus. Pollen from aquatic plants is also present. Changes in riparian vegetation and turbulent sedimentation conditions are to be expected and can be explained by a drop in the water level. As L1 was located on damp ground at that time, water influxes alternating with dry episodes were observed. In the area around L1 the sedge belt was less pronounced, and riparian woodland extended all the way to the shores of the lake. Pollen analyses of four sheep/goat dung samples provide information on the grazing season and pasture location of these domestic animals. The paper also discusses layer formation processes such as water level fluctuations and hiatuses.																			0939-6314	1617-6278				JUL	2014	23	4			SI		383	402		10.1007/s00334-014-0456-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00334-014-0456-0													WOS:000338232900005

Seasonal distributions of planktonic protozoans (HgCl2 fixed samples) and bacteria (AODC) were sampled at the surface and bottom, fortnightly from April 1988 to March 1989. Species composition and biomass (wet weight) of protozooplankton were analysed. Protozoan densities ranged from 3.60 x 10(3) to 3.89 x 10(5) ind l(-1) at the surface and from 7.11 x 10(3) to 9.75 x 10(4) ind l(-1) at the bottom, and the biomass ranged from 37 to 1170 mug l(-1) and from 63 to 4958 mug l(-1). The highest densities and biomass of both protozoans and bacteria were detected during the water column stratification period with anoxia at the bottom (warm-wet season). The smallest protozoan species prevailed at the surface and the largest at the bottom. Chlamydophrys sp., Arcella hemisphaerica, Mesodinium pulex and Halteria grandinella were numerically more important. On the other hand, Holophrya cf. discolor. Arcella hemisphaerica, Paramecium spp. and Spirostomum teres were dominant in biomass. Coccoid bacterial cells were abundant, except during the wet season when a phototrophic elongated ovoid bacterium, Thiopedia rosea, accounted for 61% of the total bacterial biomass at the bottom. The controlling factor of the protozooplankton is probably the food availability (bacteria) associated with dissolved oxygen and high temperatures.

The characters assessed were head filoplumes, thigh patch feathers, colour of cheek, neck and upper breast Plumage, colour of gular skin, and colour of suborbital skin. More intensely developed sexual characters at the time of pair formation were associated with significantly earlier breeding. Pairs that bred earlier fledged significantly more chicks than those breeding later. However, correlations between the number of chicks fledged and the intensity of the parents' sexual characters at pair formation were generally weak and not significant. An exception was the colour of the cheek, foreneck and upper breast plumage: males (but not females) with the darkest plumage in these areas fledged significantly more chicks than others. Correlations between paired male and female sexual character intensity were weak, and significant only in the case of suborbital skin colour. Other factors may have been more important than these characters in influencing mate selection.																			0908-8857	1600-048X				MAR	2002	33	1					23	30		10.1034/j.1600-048X.2002.330105.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1034/j.1600-048X.2002.330105.x													WOS:000174932300004

This is the most detailed study to date of Oxyura diet in the Palearctic region. Food items from at least 27 families of invertebrates and at least ten families of aquatic plants were identified. The method of collection of ducks and rapid digestion of soft-bodied invertebrates may have overestimated the importance of plant matter However, animal foods were more important, constituting 73% of aggregate volume of gullet contents. In both duck species and their hybrids, benthic chironomid larvae and pupae were the most important food item, present in 69% of gullets and 75% of gizzards, and constituting 35% of aggregate volume and 26% of aggregate percentage in gullets. Angiosperm seeds were the next most important dietary component, and crustaceans (mainly Amphipoda, Cladocera and Isopoda) and green plant material were of secondary importance. No significant differences in diet were detected between duck species, sex or age classes. Birds sampled in the breeding season had more nematodes, but these may have been parasitic. Chironomids were less abundant in Ruddy Ducks collected from northern Spain outside of the range of the White-headed Duck.

A small colony of approximately 75 pairs nested relatively late in the season, and egg laying occurred from about June 15 to June 29. Average clutch size in 19 marked nests was 2.5, which was low compared to that reported for most other ibis populations. Hatching success was 43% (13 of 30 eggs remaining in active nests). The geometric mean DDE egg residue (2.23 mug/g wet weight) was similar to those reported in other ibis populations where DDE-incluced shell thinning adversely affected reproductive success. Two of 16 eggs collected from marked nests had a flexible shell that easily indented with slight finger pressure. Overall mean eggshell thickness of 23 eggs was 0.264 mm, 15% thinner than shells of museum eggs collected before the widespread use of DDT. Only 1 of 23 eggs contained mercury at potentially harmful concentrations (>2.5 mug/g dry weight). Selenium in 74% of the eggs exceeded background concentrations (<3.0 mug/g dry weight), but none exceeded the toxic threshold (>8.0 mug/g dry weight).

A total of 2372 fungal colonies (1032 from air and 1340 water) was counted on 216 petri plates. We isolated twenty mould species belonging to 9 genera. Scopulariopsis brevicaulis, Penicillium expansum and Cladosporium herbarum were the most abundant species (22.0%, 13.4% and 12.9%, respectively). Cladosporium herbarum and sphaerospermum are very common in air samples (29.7% and 27.0%, respectively). Many of the species isolated are rarely in the atmospheric and water environment such as Aspergillus niger and Cladosporium variabile.

J	Rosas, FCW; Zuanon, JAS; Carter, SK				Rosas, FCW; Zuanon, JAS; Carter, SK			Feeding ecology of the giant otter, Pteronura brasiliensis	BIOTROPICA												The food habits of the giant otter, Pteronura brasiliensis, were determined by analyzing fecal samples collected year-round from communal latrines at Xixuau Creek (00 degrees 48'S, 61 degrees 33'W), Jauaperi River (central Brazilian Amazon) between 1993 and 1994. Communal latrines were also sampled during the low water season at Aquidauana River (19 degrees 32'S, 56 degrees 40'W), Pantanal of Mato Grosso do Sul (central Brazil). Fragments of vertebrae, mandibles, teeth, scales, and fn spines provided an estimate of the diet composition. Remains of fish were present in all of the samples. The main fish groups found at Xixuau Creek were Perciformes, represented specifically by Cichlidae (97.3% of all samples), Characiformes (86.5%) and Siluriformes (5.4%). The Characiformes were represented mainly by Erythrinidae (Hoplias sp. 90.6%), followed by Serrasalmidae (28%). The Anostomidae occurred with a frequency of 18.7 percent, while Characinae, Bryconinae, and Cynodontidae were only observed in 3.1 percent of the Characiformes records. At: Aquidauana River, the Characiformes were the most frequent fish group, represented in 100 percent of all samples, followed by Siluriformes (66.6%) and Perciformes (33.3%). The fish from the main groups identified in the diet of the giant otters prefer riverbanks, lakes, and flooded forests. The feeding habits of Pteronura brasiliensis are probably influenced by the vulnerability and abundance of the prey consumed by this carnivore.

Geochemistry of Alluvial Soils Composed of Metal-Enriched Sediments, Main Stem of the Coeur d'Alene River, Idaho	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL												Metal-enriched sediments produced from Ag, Pb, and Zn mining have been alluvially deposited on riparian areas along the Coeur d'Alene River in northern Idaho. Ten pedons were sampled with the objective to assess the influence of soil pedogenesis on the vertical distribution of Fe, Mn, and trace elements through these sediments and into the underlying native alluvial materials. Depth of metal-enriched sediments varied from 20 to 104 cm. The pH was similar in both parent materials, ranging from 4.9 to 6.8. The metal-enriched sediments had a high concentration of Fe, Mn, and trace elements relative to horizons of native alluvium. Depth distribution of Fe, Mn, and ratios of Fe from selective dissolution as well as microscopic and macroscopic morphological expressions of redoximorphic features were evidence of pedogenic redistribution of elements. Results suggest that redistribution was largely driven by redox changes from seasonal flooding and high water tables, resulting in dissolution/precipitation of Fe-Mn hydrous oxides. Location of the highest concentration of elements varied with depth within the metal-enriched zone and was not apparently linked to a hydrologic discontinuity between parent materials. Initial deposition of hydrous oxides may be in the capillary fringe above the water table, but data suggests that once a zone of secondary Fe deposition was established, this cementation likely influenced soil hydrology. Subsequent deposition of hydrous oxides apparently continued at this pedogenic interface. Iron was present in various forms (crystalline and noncrystalline hydrous oxides, metal-organic complexes with humic substances) and these compounds function as sinks for trace elements.																			0361-5995	1435-0661				JUL	2012	76	4					1462	1477		10.2136/sssaj2011.0442	http://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2011.0442													WOS:000306355900034
J	Guevara, SR; Catán, SP; Marvin-DiPasquale, M				Ribeiro Guevara, Sergio; Perez Catan, Soledad; Marvin-DiPasquale, Mark			Benthic methylmercury production in lacustrine ecosystems of Nahuel Huapi National Park, Patagonia, Argentina	CHEMOSPHERE												Seasonal trends of benthic methylmercury (methyl-Hg) production were examined in both littoral and open water sites of three lakes (Escondido, Moreno, and Morenito) in the North Andean Patagonia region of Argentina. Potentials of methyl-Hg production were measured by amending sediment samples with inorganic Hg-197(II), incubating for either 24 and 32 h at room temperature, and subsequently assaying the radiolabelled organomercury produced. Seasonal variations of benthic methyl-Hg production were studied but no significant correlation was observed. Lake littoral sites exhibited up to two fold higher methyl-Hg production potentials in most cases. Sediment from lakes Moreno and Morenito generally exhibited much lower (up to 10 fold) methyl-Hg production potentials than those from Lake Escondido, possibly due to differences in particulate and dissolved organic matter quantity and quality, which is higher in Lake Escondido and primarily allochthonous, whereas in lakes Moreno and Morenito is primarily autochthonous. This study represents the first to directly examine benthic microbial Hg(II)-methylation in aquatic ecosystems of Patagonia. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Carrick, H; Barbiero, RP; Tuchman, M				Carrick, H; Barbiero, RP; Tuchman, M			Variation in Lake Michigan plankton: Temporal, spatial, and historical trends	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Lake Michigan has been impacted by excessive material loading and invasion by exotic species; however, few studies have evaluated the recent basin-wide response of the lake to these changes, particularly given the reduction of phosphorus loads since the 1970s. From 1994-95, quarterly measurements were made of physical-chemical conditions, plankton biomass, and plankton species composition at 18 stations throughout the lake (n = 111). Sampling sites were clustered according to their physical-chemical similarity; these zones corresponded with depositional regions in the lake (Deep water, Shallow water, and Impacted regions). While plankton biomass did not vary among lake-zones, species composition was zone-specific suggesting that several factors (food web structure, nutrient cycling, and physical mixing) may determine the distribution of species throughout the lake. Plankton biomass and gross composition (phyla) were variable in time (seasons), and exhibited predictable succession patterns. Phytoplankton peaked in June corresponding with the upward mixing of nutrients, while zooplankton peaked during mid-stratification (August) when water temperatures were most warm. Finally, the basin-wide estimates for both total phosphorus and phytoplankton biomass were lower compared with historical estimates (measured in 1970s) and significant differences were not observed between near- and offshore regions. Despite this, the data also show that phytoplankton species composition varies widely throughout the lake, and that some nearshore sites do support impacted assemblages.																			0380-1330						2001	27	4					467	485		10.1016/S0380-1330(01)70661-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(01)70661-2													WOS:000173010400007
J	Gliwicz, ZM				Gliwicz, ZM			Species-specific population-density thresholds in cladocerans?	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The population density of a Daphnia species seems more dependent on properties specific to the species than on those specific to the point in the season, location within a lake basin or the given lake itself. In spite of week-to-week fluctuations, the population density for each of two common European Daphnia species was found to be remarkably similar within single lakes (from station to station on a single date, and from date to date at a single station) as well as from lake to lake, regardless of trophic state. All lakes on all dates revealed densities in the range 10-50 ind l(-1) for the smaller-bodied D. cucullata and 1-5 ind l(-1) for the larger-bodied D. hyalina, in spite of different intensity of reproduction resulting from different food levels (chlorophyll a between 0.2 and 4.2 mug/l). It can be asserted that the population density of each species remains far below the carrying capacity of the habitat K, and does not depend on food levels, which merely set the rate of population increase, while the population density reflects the species' vulnerability to predation by planktivorous fish. The reactive distance (the distance over which a foraging fish can see its prey) in 1+ roach, a dominant planktivore in the lakes studied, has been found to be twice as great for D. hyalina as for D. cucullata, whatever the light intensity. The relative reactive field volume was therefore an order of magnitude greater for the former than for the latter, showing that the densities of the two prey species would be assessed by a foraging roach as equal when, in reality, they differed by an order of magnitude, as they do in various lakes and in various seasons. The first of the two conclusions is that whatever the growth and reproduction in a population of a cladoceran such as Daphnia, its density would be fixed by mortality induced by fish predation. The second would be, that the difference between the bottom-up and top-down effects in freshwater is more than merely the upward or downward direction along the food web, since the bottom-up effects are about the flow control (the rate of net production, individual growth rate, rate of reproduction) and the top-down about the standing-crop control (biomass, individual body size, population density level).																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN	2001	442	1-3					291	300																WOS:000167924900028

This humid phase (Tauca phase) was likely due to strenghtened tropical (monsoonal) circulation, which brought continental moisture to the Atacama Altiplano. The lake level of Laguna Lejia (23 degrees 30'S, 4350 m) at that time was up to 25 m higher than it is today. Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca data from lake sediments show that, what today is a highly saline lake was a freshwater lake at that time. Seasonally-laminated calcareous sediments were deposited between 13 500 and < 10 400 yr B.P. indicating the maximum of the humid phase. Climatic changes in the past are important for current groundwater resources. C-14 and H-3 data from lake-, ground- and well water suggest that modern groundwater formation (i.e. water < 40 years) in the Altiplano is very limited under current arid conditions. We conclude that significant amounts of the water resources in this area originated during the time of the late-glacial and early Holocene humid climate. Tritium data from snow samples show that the moisture in the Altiplano at 22-24 degrees S is mainly of continental origin, whereas precipitation from the westerlies hardly contributes to the water supply in this area. This precipitation pattern matches the paleodata, and we suggest that current precipitation formation may provide an analogue framework for late-glacial circulation in this area.																			0921-2728					NOV	1995	14	3					241	252		10.1007/BF00682426	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00682426													WOS:A1995TD95100003
J	Sarch, MT				Sarch, MT			Fishing and farming at Lake Chad: Institutions for access to natural resources	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Lake Chad is a vitally important wetland in the semi-arid Sahel corridor. It provides the basis of many thousands of livelihoods which depend on its seasonal fluctuations to renew fish stocks, farmland and rangeland. This paper describes how access to farmland and fishing rights has evolved on the Nigerian shore of the lake. The paper aims to assess the applicability of different institutional approaches to natural resource management on the lake shore. Although many recent approaches to natural resource management have reflected a 'Tragedy of the Commons' approach, a growing literature both in support and critical of Hardin's (1968) thesis has followed. Four distinct approaches are considered: (1) institutional intervention to prevent 'tragedy'; (2) institution erosion brought about by such interventions; (3) models of institutional adaptation to resource scarcity; and (4) approaches which perceive institutions as a crucial determinant of social and economic development In examining which institutional approaches may be relevant at Lake Chad, it is anticipated that this paper will provide insights which will be relevant to policy-makers, resource managers and students working in environments where resource fluctuation inhibits stable property rights and state resource management has proved neither feasible nor successful. The western shore of Lake Chad has been under the jurisdiction of Borno State in its various guises since the end of the fourteenth century and is currently one of 36 states in the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Although the administrative status of Borno itself has varied, it has been dominated by a Kanuri aristocracy for most of ifs existence. The Kanuri administration has continued to operate in a remarkably similar way over the past 150 years. Traditionally, it has played a crucial role in allocating access to farm land. In recent years, the 'Kanuri administration' has not only maintained its pre-colonial authority over farming on the lake shore, but has expanded if to cover new areas of the lake floor and the increasingly lucrative fishing opportunities which federal government has been unable to regulate. This success suggests that collaboration with the organisations which operate such institutions could be beneficial, if not essential, to the success of natural resource management.

The negative relationship between egg thiamine and lipid concentration to post-hatch larval growth and survival in teleost species, coupled with the limited research of egg thiamine in Acipenseriform species of conservation concern, including lake sturgeon, indicates that study of thiamine concentrations lake sturgeon eggs is warranted. Eggs were collected from females (N = 12) during the early and late portion of the spawning run in 2007 in a wild population from Black Lake, MI. Concentrations of thiamine, lipid and fatty acid concentration were measured along with female biological information (body size and egg size) and characteristics of larvae at hatch. Significant differences in egg thiamine concentrations were observed between early- and late-spawning females (mean +/- SD: 2.36 nmol center dot g(-1) +/- 1.09 vs. 0.73 +/- 0.25 nmol center dot g(-1), W = 0.05, p < .01). No significant relationships were observed between female body size or egg size and egg lipid or thiamine concentration. Differences in lipid and thiamine concentrations were not predictive of larval body size or yolk sac volume at hatch. Total and phosphorylated thiamine were correlated with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, suggesting that dietary items were likely partially responsible for provisioning of essential compounds. Given the negative effects of low egg thiamine concentration on larval survival in other fish species globally, results indicate that further research in areas of nutrient acquisition and thiamine effects on larval survival, natural recruitment, and hatchery feeding strategies is warranted for lake sturgeon.					; Lee, Bong Joo/HKE-7093-2023; Dabrowski, Konrad/MAI-4829-2025	Lee, Bong-Joo/0000-0002-7222-4885; Larson, Douglas/0000-0002-5264-9499; Crossman, James/0000-0002-7134-982X													0175-8659	1439-0426				OCT	2021	37	5					655	663		10.1111/jai.14239	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jai.14239		JUL 2021											WOS:000669884100001
J	NEARY, AJ; GIZYN, WI				NEARY, AJ; GIZYN, WI			THROUGHFALL AND STEMFLOW CHEMISTRY UNDER DECIDUOUS AND CONIFEROUS FOREST CANOPIES IN SOUTH-CENTRAL ONTARIO	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE RECHERCHE FORESTIERE												By measuring incident precipitation, throughfall, and stemflow chemistry, the roles of coniferous- and deciduous-dominated forest canopies as a source of and sink for ions in precipitation were examined. A regression technique for distinguishing between external (dry deposition) and internal (canopy leaching) sources of ions in the throughfall flux was evaluated. The effect of seasonal changes in the forest canopy on throughfall and stemflow chemistry was also examined. Throughfall comprised 74 and 84%, respectively, of the hydrologic flux at the coniferous and deciduous sites. Sulphate fluxes were highest at the coniferous site during both growing and dormant seasons, suggesting either a higher scavenging efficiency of the needles for atmospheric SO42-, or higher SO42- leaching from the foliage. The deciduous site neutralized acidic inputs, as demonstrated by its net negative H+ flux year round. The buffering capacity of the coniferous forest was exceeded by the higher amount of acid interception by the canopy. Nitrate behaved conservatively and base ions were exported from the canopy. Stemflow contributions of ions, although low, were generally higher than the contribution of stemflow to the hydrologic flux (2-3%). Independent dry deposition measurements for the growing season, when compared with net SO42- flux, overestimated dry deposition collected by the deciduous canopy, but were comparable to the flux at the coniferous site. These data suggest that dry SO2-SO42- deposition may be responsible for all SO42- enrichment seen in throughfall at these sites. A regression technique for separating internal and external ion sources in throughfall yielded inconsistent results, and attributed virtually all ion enrichment to internal sources. Problems with false assumptions and spurious correlations are discussed. We conclude that this method is not satisfactory for separating ion sources. Seasonal patterns in throughfall chemistry are present. During the growing seasons bases exchange for H+ and are exported similarly with SO42- . Hydrogen retention mirrors SO42- export. Base cations (particularly K+) are leached from the canopy primarily during senescence, but from the stem of the tree primarily during the dormant period. This was most evident at the deciduous site. Chloride behaved in a similar manner, while NH4+ and H+ were retained during the senescent period.																			0045-5067					JUN	1994	24	6					1089	1100		10.1139/x94-145	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x94-145													WOS:A1994PB67500002

Wild spawners were angled at the beginning of the spawning season. Only females with a condition coefficient value higher than the mean were included in the experiment and then stimulated with Ovopel. Group A (n=20) was given standard treatment (0.2 pellet kg(-1) and 1.0 pellet kg(-1) after 12 h), whereas group B (n=8) was treated with a single dose of 2.0 pellets kg(-1). After fertilisation with the dry method, the glutinous eggs attached to the bottom of flow-through aquaria were incubated at 17.1-18.4degreesC. Throughout incubation (85Ddegrees), dead eggs were removed and counted. The same was done with dead larvae, those with deformed bodies or those with empty alimentary tracts after 2 days of external feeding. Two injections of Ovopel resulted in a significantly (Pless than or equal to0.05) higher ovulation rate in comparison with the single dose (70 and 25% in groups A and B, respectively). The individual hatching rates were very high (98.4-100%), as was the share of good quality larvae (91.1 and 96.5% of stripped eggs in groups A and B, respectively). These results indicate that the standard propagation method used with commercially important cyprinid species can also be used to successfully breed E. perenurus.

Through the Neogene, these events caused environmental changes, which mirrored in the composition of faunal assemblages as well. The aquatic environments gradually changed from marine, brackish to caspibrackish and to freshwater lakes due to isolation, followed by development of ephemeral lakes and alluvial plains. The terrestrial record documents some faunal (mammalian) successions from the Middle Miocene to the Pliocene (HRI 3 - HRI 1), attended by the retreat of the subtropical zone vegetation at the beginning of the Late Miocene. The immigration of new ,,Hipparion" fauna, as well as the replacement of swamp vegetation by a ,,coniferous forest" of the temperate zone can be interpreted as the first appearance of the seasonality with lowered humidity at the Pannonian-Pontian boundary. The Late Pontian to Early Pliocene fauna as well as flora support the increase of humidity in temperate climate, followed by the temperature drop in next periods.																					80-210-3566-8				2004							65	84																WOS:000231561000008

Reed (Phragmites australis) detritus decomposition was studied in a stream, a freshwater lake and a salt marsh on a seasonal basis at a total of 20 sampling stations using the leaf pack technique. Overall, the spatial variability of leaf decomposition rates was more pronounced than the temporal variability, decomposition rates in the stream being 3.6 and 5.2 times faster than in the freshwater lake and salt marsh, respectively. The intra-habitat spatial variability of leaf decay rates in the stream was also higher than in the other systems. Environmental features were relevant factors affecting intra-and inter-habitat variation of reed decay rates, and their relevance to leaf detritus decomposition showed a strong seasonal variation.					sangiorgio, franca/C-4052-2009; Pinna, Maurizio/AGM-1535-2022	sangiorgio, franca/0000-0002-0837-6673; Pinna, Maurizio/0000-0001-8335-4098													0275-7540	1029-0370					2004	20			1			S353	S366		10.1080/02757540410001664594	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02757540410001664594													WOS:000208520200029

The highest maximum concentrations were observed for atrazine (1,039 ng/L), metolachlor (736 ng/L), and D-simazine (281 ng/L). No pesticide concentrations exceeded water quality guidelines/criteria for the protection of aquatic life and drinking water.

Sedimentology of the Miocene evaporitic succession in the north of Cankiri-Corum basin, central Anatolia, Turkey	CARBONATES AND EVAPORITES												The upper Miocene non-marine sediments of the Cankiri-Corum basin in central Anatolia, have both evaporitic and non-evaporitic successions. These sediments were deposited in an evaporitic lake which had temporary episodes of palustrine conditions in response to seasonal or climatic changes. The successions show different facies such as sulfates, carbonates and siliciclastics. The sulfates comprise primary, reworked and diagenetic gypsum. The primary deposits are predominantly laminated gypsum, bedded gypsum and selenite. The reworked (detrital) gypsum comprises gypsite, gypsarenite, gypsrudite and breccias. The diagenetic type comprises micro- and macrogypsum nodules. The carbonates mainly include clayey limestone, oolitic limestone and dolomite. The siliciclastics comprise red beds and both channel and non-channel, conglomerates and mudstones.Laminated gypsum, composed of alternating gypsum and dolomite, was a result of environmental schizohalinity. Bedded gypsum was precipitated in the deeper part of the lake during high evaporation periods. Chevron-type selenite crystals formed on saline mud flats during the times of aridity, whereas the discoidal-type seen in the organic-rich mudstones occurred in the gypsiferous marshes during the times of humidity. Reworked (detrital) gypsum dominates the lake margin. These formed during periodic wet episodes that caused reworking of primary gypsum. Gypsum nodules occurred as both early and late diagenetic products. Carbonates and siliciclastics were deposited during the freshening periods of the lake.Climatic or seasonal changes were the main causes of the depositional styles of the upper Miocene evaporitic and non-evaporitic lacustrine deposits in Cankiri-Corum basin. Additionally, the transition upward from alluvial to lake environment implies an important change in drainage patterns that likely occurred as a result of marginal fault activity.					; Seyitoglu, Gurol/AAH-4466-2020	Seyitoglu, Gurol/0000-0001-7993-898X; 													0891-2556	1878-5212				SEP	2002	17	2					197	209		10.1007/BF03176485	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF03176485													WOS:000507140000014

Sediments were collected from soft bottoms of 41 water systems and fed to midge larvae. These sediments were analyzed for organic matter (OM) content, total C, N, and P, carbohydrates, proteins, fatty acids, pigments, and grain-size distribution. A microbial assay was used as an indicator of the fraction of easily biodegradable OM. Positive correlations of larval growth or survival with polyunsaturated fatty acids, pigments, and labile OM were found when these biochemical variables were standardized based on dry mass. When variables were standardized based on mass of OM, additional significant positive correlations between larval growth and P, carbohydrates, proteins, and fatty acids of bacterial origin were detected. Similarly, multivariate analyses revealed stronger correlations between larval growth and survival and biochemical variables standardized by OM compared to those standardized by dry mass. We postulate that dilution of OM by mineral particles caused the difference between the standardization methods. Organic matter content of sediments, particularly labile organic matter, appeared to strongly influence detritivore growth.					; van den brink, Paul/AAT-7144-2020; van den Brink, Paul/E-8315-2013	van den brink, Paul/0000-0002-7241-4347; 													0887-3593					SEP	2002	21	3					443	456		10.2307/1468481	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1468481													WOS:000177578100007

Surface water extent dynamics from three periods of continuous Landsat time series; subregional differences across Argentine plains	REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION												The Pampean region in Argentina is an extensive plain characterized by abundant shallow lakes that fulfill many environmental, ecological, and social functions. This study aims to detect the multiannual lake area changes in this region during 2001-2009 using remote sensing, including lakes as small as >= 10,000 m(2) or 1 ha. Landsat scenes of the wet (2008-2009), normal (2006), and dry (2008-2009) seasons were obtained, and using remote sensing techniques, the number and area of shallow lakes were calculated. The spatiotemporal variation of shallow lakes was studied in different climate periods in eight singular subregions. Spatial associations between annual precipitation and lake number and area were analyzed through the development of a Geographic Information System (GIS) at a subregional scale. During the study period the total lake area in the Pampean region decreased by 5257.39 km(2) (62 %), but each subregion showed different responses to climatic events. In seven of them, the differences between climate periods prove to be statistically significant (P>0.01). The relationship between precipitation and lake number and area revealed the domain of positive association. We conclude that climate factors play a dominant role in lake changes across the Pampean plains. However, other factors such as origin, topographic and edaphic characteristics intensify or mitigate changes in surface hydrology.

In this study, a methodological approach is presented to spatially assess the trophic state of large territories based on public water quality databases. The trophic state index (TSI) includes total nitrogen, total phosphorus, chlorophyll A, chemical oxygen demand, and Secchi disk depth values as water quality indicators. A geographical information system (GIS) was used to manage the spatiotemporal attributes of the water quality data, in addition to spatially displaying the results of TSI calculations. As a case study, this methodological approach was applied to determine the critical regions for mitigating eutrophication in the state of Jalisco, Mexico. Although a decreasing trend was observed for the TSI values over time for most subbasins (2012-2019), a tendency for extreme hypereutrophication was observed in some regions, such as the Guadalajara metropolitan area and the Altos region, which are of high economic relevance at the state level. A correlation analysis was performed between the TSI parameters and rainfall measurements for all subbasins under analysis, which suggested a tendency for nutrient wash-off during the rainy seasons for most subbasins; however, further research is needed to quantify the real impacts of rainfall by including other variables such as elevation and slope. The relationships between the water quality indicators and land cover were also explored. The GIS methodology proposed in this study can be used to spatially assess the trophic state of large regions over time, taking advantage of available water quality databases. This will enable the efficient development and implementation of public policies to assess and mitigate the eutrophication of water sources, as well as the efficient allocation of resources for critical regions. Further studies should focus on applying integrated approaches combining on-site monitoring data, remote sensing data, and machine learning algorithms to spatially evaluate the trophic state of territories.

Zooplankton of Lake Pyasino and the Rivers Flowing into It after the Diesel Spill in 2020	CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY												At the beginning of August, 2 months after 20 000 t of diesel fuel spilled into the Bezymyanny Stream (which took it out to the Daldykan and Ambarnaya rivers), the large Norilsk expedition of the Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences, sampled net zooplankton at 13 stations located in both sections of these rivers and Lake Pyasino with the Pyasina River outflowing from it. A comparative analysis of the species composition, abundance, biomass, and saprobity index of zooplankton at these stations has been carried out. The productions of rotifer and crustacean zooplankton and potential production of planktivorous fish in Lake Pyasino have been calculated. Based on the state of zooplankton, a gradual improvement in water quality has been observed from river areas exposed to the oil products to the northern part of the lake and the River Pyasina outflow. The low abundance and biomass of zooplankton in the lake (43 800 +/- 17 550 ind./m(3), 112.8 +/- 26.2 mg/m(3), on average) due to the dominance of rotifers (Ploesoma truncatum (Levander), Bipalpus hudsoni (Imhof), and Conochilus unicornis Rousselet) resulted in low values of zooplankton production and the potential production of planktivorous fish (0.85 kg/ha per season).

EVALUATING COMPOSITIONAL FIDELITY AND SOURCES OF MORTALITY OF SHORELINE FISH CARCASSES IN A FRESHWATER LAKE COMMUNITY IN WESTERN CANADA	PALAIOS												Taxonomic comparisons of death assemblages with extant communities continue to provide insight for ecological studies but whether demographic aspects such as age structure, sex ratio, and causes of mortality arc accurately captured by the former remains little studied. At a 110 ha dystropic lake in western Canada, seasonal shoreline accumulations of fish carcasses were collected annually for 12 years (N=4499) during 95 full lake-circuits and analyzed for taxa, body size frequencies, sex ratio relative to live-captures and sources of mortality. Rank order of the four fish species (Gasterosteus aculeatus, Oncorhynchus clarki, O. keta, Salvelinus mabna) was similar for live-captures and carcasses. Of the dominant species (G. aculeatus), modal adult body length (similar to 80 mm SL) was the same for carcasses and live-captures and shifted by about 10% over 30 years with parallel trends between the groups for both sexes. Age-specific body size was about 5% larger (P<0.001) in carcasses than live-captures. Carcasses were significantly female-biased (2:1) each year relative to a population sex ratio of 1:1 in the lake. There was a complete absence of juvenile fish (<30 mm) among carcasses but these constituted 70% of the live population. Estimated relative contributions to mortality for the carcasses include starvation (<1%), parasitism (3%), senescence (4%) and lethal injuries from predator attack (70-80%). If these carcasses are representative of a fossil series in freshwater lake sediments, then several demographic parameters including age-specific body size, age-class frequencies and sex ratio depart substantially from the live population. As well, the virtual absence of avian piscivores in the carcass assemblage, the major source of predation on the fish population, warrants additional attention in paleoecological studies.																			0883-1351	1938-5323				JUL	2021	36	7					260	268		10.2110/palo.2020.045	http://dx.doi.org/10.2110/palo.2020.045													WOS:000679659700002

Hydrology and the functioning of seasonal wetland aquaculture-agriculture systems (Fingerponds) at the shores of Lake Victoria, Kenya	AQUACULTURAL ENGINEERING												Experimental seasonal wetland-based integrated aquaculture-agriculture systems called 'Fingerponds' were established at two sites (Nyangera and Kusa villages) at the shores of Lake Victoria in Kenya to enhance the wetland fishery potential. This paper examines the hydrological characteristics of Fingerponds. In Fingerponds' design, the water supply is un-regulated and the water balance is maintained by natural losses and gains. At the beginning of the season, flood events are critically important for the initial water supply to the ponds. During their functional period (which lasted for about 6 months into the dry season after flood recession), precipitation accounted for nearly 90% of the total water gains while seepage and evaporation contributed an average of 30-70% of the losses, respectively. Seasonal pond water budgets indicated that the losses outweighed the gains leading to a progressive decline of water depth during the dry season. A prediction of the effect of pond volume and weather conditions on the functional period for fish production was carried out using a dynamic simulation model. The results indicated that the culture period can be extended by 2.5 months by deepening the ponds to an average depth of 1.5 m: this would increase the overall fish harvest. Drier weather accelerated losses and shortened the culture period by 1-2 months. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Impact of Holocene climate change on silicon cycling in Lake 850, Northern Sweden	HOLOCENE												Diatom-rich sediment in a small subarctic lake (Lake 850) was investigated in a 9400 cal. yr BP sediment record in order to explore the impact of Holocene climate evolution on silicon cycling. Diatom stable silicon isotopes ( delta 30 Si BSi ) and biogenic silica (BSi) indicate that high BSi concentrations in sediment throughout the Holocene are associated with a lighter Si isotope source of dissolved silica (DSi), such as groundwater or freshly weathered primary minerals. Furthermore, higher BSi concentrations were favoured during the mid-Holocene by low detrital inputs and possibly a longer ice-free period allowing for more diatom production to occur. The diatom delta 30 Si BSi signature shows a link to changes in regional climate and is influenced by length of diatom growth period and hydrological fluctuations. Lighter Si isotopic values occur during the mid-Holocene, when climate is inferred to be more continental and drier, with pronounced seasonality. In contrast, a heavier Si isotopic signature is observed in the early and late Holocene, when oceanic influences are thought to be stronger and the climate wetter. The delta 30 Si BSi values have generally lighter signatures as compared with other studies, which supports a light DSi source.

J	Zurek, R				Zurek, Roman			Zooplankton of a flooded opencast sulphur mine	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												The zooplankton community of a flooded opencast sulphur mine was investigated during two years. The complicated physical and chemical relationships in this water-filled pit caused an atypical plankton assemblage. At the time of the investigation 20 species of rotifers, 6 of Cladocera, and 8 species of Copepoda were found. A single Ostracod and Chaoborus flavicans were also noted in the samples. Usually the epilimnion was monopolised by rotifers whereas the hypolimnion had a more diversified assemblage of rotifers, cladocerans and copepods. The result of clustering analysis indicated that each predator was associated with its own group of prey. Discrimination analyses showed weak seasonal differences in the zooplankton and three zones in the vertical profile - epilimnetic, upper hypolimnetic and anaerobic. Principal component analysis reduced the chemical parameters to the main contributors of conductivity (the main anions and cations) plus toxic sulphide and hydrogen sulphide. The animals were classified by the first two components into two groups: cold stenotherms and medium-sized filtrators, such as Bosmina longirostris. A specific analysis of vertical profiles generated five variants of diel vertical migrations. When time-space distributions of the plankters were analysed the highest numbers of different species were usually in different times and depths. The epilimnion was inhabited by small fishes and was dominated by rotifers but was free from C. flavicans which inhabited the cold hypolimnion, together with the remaining invertebrate predators (copepods and Asplanchna).Chaoborus and the other invertebrate predators participated more evenly in the contributions of species to the total density. In the presence of invertebrate predators the structure of the rotifer population shifted from soft-bodied species to spined or fast-moving species. When the predation pressure was too strong, as in the hypolimnion, the soft-bodied species were, in practice, absent. When the pit was in an oligotrophic state the hypolimnion population was composed of up to 60-90% rotifers. When the trophic state shifted to mesotrophy, the proportion of cladocerans increased.																			1386-2588	1573-5125				JUN	2006	40	2					177	202		10.1007/s10452-005-9002-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-005-9002-6													WOS:000240830000005

The water policy provides for mandatory reserve (environmental flow) which should be sustained in a water resource. Four out of the six main catchments in Kenya face water scarcity. Further water resource quality objectives for many rivers are yet to be determined. This study applied Water Evaluation and Planning System (WEAP21) to study the implications of implementing the water reserve in Perkerra River which is among the few rivers that drain into Lake Baringo. The Tennant method was used to determine minimum environmental flows that should be sustained into the lake. WEAP21 was used to perform hydrological and water management analysis of the catchment. Mean monthly discharge time series of the catchment monitoring stations indicate that Perkerra River is becoming seasonal. The results further show that implementing the reserve with the present level of water management and development will increase the demand by more than 50%. With good regulation policies Chemususu dam project will reduce the impact of the reserve on abstractive uses by 20 to 40% and ensure that Perkerra River does not dry up.

A kinetic-based model was used to predict congener-specific bioaccumulation factors of PCBs in phytoplankton samples collected from Green Bay, Lake Michigan. These values were compared to the measured bioaccumulation factors, and the sum of the residuals was used to evaluate the model's predictive quality. The sorbing matrix fraction (F-M) that minimized the sum of residuals of the model was then solved by iteration. The appropriateness of using dry weight, organic carbon fraction, or lipid fractions as the sorbing matrix fraction was determined by measuring their correlation to the optimum F-M. It was determined that the F-M correlated best with the organic carbon fraction, and this correlation appeared to be independent of both the spatial and seasonal differences of the field samples.																			0013-936X					MAY 1	1999	33	9					1516	1519		10.1021/es980710t	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es980710t													WOS:000080107000045

Rock Magnetic Characterisation of Tropical Soils From Southern India: Implications to Pedogenesis and Soil Erosion	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												In this study we report the rock magnetic properties of surface soil samples and their spatial variability from the northernmost district of Kerala to understand pedogenic processes and soil erosion. The magnetic signal is mainly from fine grained pedogenic magnetite as other sources like anthropogenic and lithogenic magnetite, bacterial magnetite and greigite are absent. The surface soil samples were collected from four locations (Aribail, Kodlamogaru, Miyapadavu and Seethangoli). Magnetic properties (c(lf), c(fd,) c(ARM,) IRM's at different field strengths) determined on these samples exhibit significant variations for the four locations. Aribail samples contain a lower concentration of magnetic minerals whereas Miyapadavu samples exhibit higher values. The magnetic mineralogy is softer and the magnetic grain size finer in Miyapadavu samples whereas it is harder and coarser in Aribail samples. The magnetic properties of samples from other locations (Kodlamogaru and Seethangoli) exhibit wide variations. In general, the magnetic concentration increases, grain size decreases and mineralogy become softer as one traverses from NW to SE in the study area. Such variations in soil magnetic properties may be due to the geographical location of sampling sites and vulnerability to erosion, as other factors like parent rock, rainfall, temperature and vegetation are almost similar in all the four locations. Our study also indicates that higher production of pedogenic magnetite occurs in the monsoon season and the time lag between erosion of magnetite during heavy rains and production of 'new magnetite' is not very large. This data would also serve as primary database for future pollution studies.

Comparison of anchovy biomass estimates measured by trawls, egg production methods and hydro-acoustics in the Chesapeake Bay and the Korea Strait	OCEAN SCIENCE JOURNAL												We compared estimates of anchovy biomass derived from trawl surveys, egg production method (EPM) and acoustic surveys, conducted in two remote regions. Biomass density of bay anchovy Anchoa mitchilli was estimated in Chesapeake Bay, USA, by trawls, EPM and acoustics from 1989 to 2000. Biomass density of Pacific anchovy Engraulis japonicus was estimated in the Korea Strait using EPM, simulation-based daily cohort analysis and acoustics from 1984 to 2006. Most of the existing estimates already had considered body-size-dependent gear selectivity, highlyvariable instantaneous natural mortality of anchovy eggs, and avoidance of trawl nets by adult anchovy. Despite great variability in the ratio of trawl to acoustic biomass estimates (0.034-8.35), annually-averaged biomass density of young-ofthe-year individuals derived by the two methods were similar for bay anchovy in Chesapeake Bay and Pacific anchovy in the Korea Strait (0.83 and 0.70 g m(-3), respectively). Results suggested that, despite substantial uncertainty, anchovy biomass estimates are generally compatible between EPM and acoustics. However, reported estimates of biomass density derived from the two acoustic surveys in the Korea Strait differed by a factor of 28, suggesting that further improvements in calibrations are required to reliably estimate anchovy biomass. The comparisons suggested that all biomass estimates could be biased and will require comparison and validation by other, independent sampling methods.

Nitrous Oxide Emissions from Soils in Louisiana's Atchafalaya River Basin	WETLANDS												The Atchafalaya River Basin functions as a net sink for nitrogen delivered by the Mississippi and Red Rivers. Continued influx of river-borne sediment drives rapid habitat change on the floodplain, and lakes are transitioning to seasonally flooded baldcypress swamps and bottomland hardwood forests. As flooding regimes change, leading to more intermittent wet and dry cycles, soil conditions become more conducive to incomplete denitrification resulting in increased N2O emissions. The objective of this laboratory study was to determine if sediments in the Basin are potential sources of N2O emissions, and if emission rates differ among habitats types. Results indicate that potential N2O emission rates are low, and differ by habitat type. Lake sediments had the highest potential denitrification rates (53.68 g N-2-N ha(-1)d(-1)), while baldcypress sediments had the highest potential N2O emissions (2.31 g N2O-N ha(-1)d(-1)). Unflooded bottomland hardwood sediments had very low denitrification potential and were not a source of N2O emissions, but emissions of both N-2 and N2O increased after bottomland hardwood sediments were flooded. These results suggest that overall N2O emissions are low, but management strategies aiming to improve water quality and reduce greenhouse gas emissions should consider each habitat separately when modeling nitrogen removal within large floodplains.					; Scaroni, Amy/AAL-1874-2020; Nyman, John/D-3903-2009	Nyman, John/0000-0002-9792-9072; 													0277-5212	1943-6246				JUN	2014	34	3					545	554		10.1007/s13157-014-0521-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-014-0521-6													WOS:000336288800013

The Trophic State of Patagonian Argentinean Lakes and its Relationship with Depth Distribution in Sediment Phosphorus	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The parameters used to determine the trophic state of a water body are: total phosphorus (TP), transparency (Secchi disk depth) and chlorophyll a. However, these parameters show strong seasonal fluctuations which may hinder the estimation of trophic state. Some authors have proposed that sediments be used as an additional tool to evaluate the trophic state of a water body. The aim of this study was to determine the depth distribution of sediment TP in relation with the lake trophic state. Nine sediment corers from water bodies located in Patagonian Region (Argentina) were studied. The nutrient concentrations in pore water and in sediments were analyzed. The results obtained showed that there is a relationship between the depth distribution of sediment TP and the trophic state for all studied environments. Two exceptions were noted to this general pattern (Lakes Caviahue and Lacar). Our findings indicate that both pore water and sediments could be considered as the best parameters to estimate the tropic state of a water body compared to the water column.

Black bears can readily habituate to urban clusters, and wildlife managers need to monitor and manage these urban bear populations. We modified DNA-based CMR for black bear using hair-snares to take into account the small home ranges of urban bears, urban bear behavior, and human safety within Mammoth Lakes, California, USA. We conducted this study for 3 field seasons in 2010, 2011, and 2012 from June to July. Each field season, we implemented a CMR with 6 encounter occasions, each 7 days in length. We used the traditional corral hair-snare design modified for human safety and chose multiple non-consumable and minimally consumable lure types to prevent food conditioning and a trap-happy response. In 2012, we also tested 3 additional hair-snare designs more appropriate for urban areas: natural rub, haphazard-wire snare, and tennis ball snare. In 2010, we collected an insufficient number of hair samples for CMR by putting hair-snares in the periphery of the urban cluster, which we call the urban-wildland interface. However, in 2011 and 2012, when we put hair-snares in the city center as well as the surrounding urban-wildlife interface and increased hair-snare density, we obtained a sufficient number of hair samples to estimate population density using closed capture CMR models. These adjustments to hair snaring study design in urban areas helped increase capture and recapture rates to be similar to our wildland area. To achieve high capture rates using hair-snares in the urban area, we put out hair-snares at a density approximately 4 times greater than in our wildland study area and distributed them throughout the entire urban area, and not just on the urban-wildlife interface. In addition, setting hair-snares near anthropogenic features used by bears in urban areas (e.g., culverts, utility poles, dumpsters) and adding spent cooking oil to lures also increased our capture rate. Finally, the corral hair-snare had the highest capture rates of our 4 hair-snare designs. After adapting a study design for hair-snaring wildland bears, our methods were efficient for urban areas, having high capture and recapture rates (> 0.30) and good precision for abundance estimates (coefficient of variation < 0.2), while maintaining human safety.																			1934-4392	1936-8046				SPR	2017	11	1					64	77																WOS:000403125200008

Analysis of Errors in Estimating Changes in Water Body Areas by Satellite Data: Case Study of Thermokarst Lakes in Yamal Peninsula	WATER RESOURCES												Errors in the estimates of changes in the area of individual water bodies and their groups have been studied in the central part of Yamal Peninsula based on Landsat satellite imagery. For the first time, the overlap zone of two satellite images along satellite trajectory has been proposed for the choice of the most efficient algorithm for identifying water surfaces and estimating the errors in water body area measurements. Empirical equations have been derived to describe the relationship between the error in estimates of changes in the areas of individual water bodies and their groups and the areas themselves. The seasonal and many-year variations in water body areas have been identified in the zone of intense construction of facilities at the Bovanenkovskoe oil-gas condensate field.																			0097-8078	1608-344X				MAR	2017	44	2					180	191		10.1134/S0097807816060038	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0097807816060038													WOS:000398107300002

One of the driving factors is nutrient enrichment from human activities in the catchment, which is causing eutrophication. This has been associated with, among others, the rapid proliferation of water hyacinth, alga blooms, and with general disruption of the lake ecosystem. Most of pollution to the lake flow via the natural wetlands. In order to understand how wetlands function within the Lake Victoria ecosystem a wetland model has been developed. The main objective of the model is to establish and simulate the buffering processes and capacity of individual wetlands (that is, their ability to absorb sediments, nutrients and pollutants) within the Lake Victoria basin. It was found that in both seasonal and permanent swamp there is a net export of organic matter produced in the wetlands. Most of the inorganic phosphorous were retained in the wetlands (60% to 90% removal) while there was a. negative retention of nitrates probably due to the export of organic matter which associate very much with nitrates.

Rainbow trout performance in food-limited environments: implications for future assessment and management	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												We evaluated the performance of rainbow trout in food-limited lake and hatchery environments using whole-body water content as a proxy for fish energy reserves and lipid content. Relative abundance of rainbow trout stocked in an oligotrophic lake from 2002 to 2006 decreased by 88% in 145 days. Whole-body water content of rainbow trout increased following stocking in the lake and similar increases in water content were observed in fish from a food-deprived hatchery treatment. Water content in the fed hatchery fish was significantly lower than water content observed in stocked lake fish. Traditional metrics of body condition (i.e., Fulton's K and relative weight) based on length-weight relationships were insufficient to detect the observed changes in whole-body water content for all lake and hatchery treatments. We conclude that depletion of energy reserves contributed to poor survival and low angling returns of stocked rainbow trout in the study lake.																			0270-5060					JUN	2012	27	2					159	170		10.1080/02705060.2012.657864	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2012.657864													WOS:000304454400001

D19313	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												[1] Diurnal variation in methane fluxes can cause systematic errors in flux estimates, particularly at places with aquatic vegetation. Closed chamber measurements were made during the ice-free period in central Finland. Methane fluxes were quantified at an interval of a few hours for several boreal lakeshore communities consisting of Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud. and of wetland sedges, grasses, and herbs. The automated measurement system was operated for 4 months in a P. australis stand and for 2 months in a site with mixed wetland vegetation. Additional manual measurements lasted for a few days. In P. australis stands the CH4 fluxes were typically highest around noon. On the average, efflux of CH4 measured during office hours (0800 - 1600 local time (LT)) should be corrected using a factor 0.68 to obtain a more reliable estimate of daily CH4 release. The fluctuation magnitude varied between different locations and over the study period, being the greatest in the most productive parts of the stands in August. A harmonic regression model, scaled with temperature and stand biomass, was successfully applied to reconstruct CH4 flux in P. australis stand. In the sedge, grass and herb stands the diurnal fluctuation in CH4 flux was generally small. Commonly, daily maximum in efflux occurred during evening or night and large ( threefold) diurnal differences were occasionally found. Daytime measurements alone can result in a slight or moderate underestimate of the total flux for the wetland communities. These results recommend that spatial and seasonal differences in diurnal CH4 flux dynamics should be considered when planning measuring or modeling CH4 fluxes.					; Saarnio, Sanna/A-2258-2017	Saarnio, Sanna/0000-0002-1915-0370; Alm, Jukka/0000-0002-1470-8849; 													2169-897X	2169-8996				OCT 12	2004	109	D19							D19313	10.1029/2004JD004782	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2004JD004782													WOS:000224578500005

Los Molinos reservoir represents an essential source of supply for the capital city (with 1.5 million inhabitants). The use of the water body is multiple, including not only the supply of water for human consumption, but also production of electric power, flood control, irrigation, recreation and touristic activities, with some small settlements existing within the boundaries of the lake. Since three decades back, a deterioration of the water quality has been observed, as well as eutrophication signs and periodic algal blooms. Within the scope of an interdisciplinary and interinstitutional research project, a seasonal-and currently monthly-monitoring was started in 1999. In this paper, main sources of phosphorus are identified, as well as their contribution to the total load of the reservoir by means of using the Flux modeling software and indirect calculations. Additionally, hydrodynamic and quality models (Dysrem-Caedym) are also applied, calibrated with field data. Finally, satellite images (Landsat) are used as a tool to develop models of space distribution of quality parameters (chlorophyll-a) in a reflectance function. The combination of remote sensing methods and numerical simulation for the behavior of the system associated to field works will allow to generate new bases for water resources planning and administration, especially on semi-arid regions, such as the Los Molinos reservoir case.																			0186-4076					APR-JUN	2005	20	2					121	135																WOS:000228774000009
J	Bernier, L; Warren, LA				Bernier, L.; Warren, L. A.			Microbially driven acidity generation in a tailings lake	GEOBIOLOGY												In situ characterization and geochemical modelling of acid generation in a mine tailings lake (Moose Lake, ON, Canada) over a 2-year period (2001-2002; surficial lake pyrrhotite slurry disposal initiated in 2002) show that bacteria significantly impact acidity behaviour through particle-associated S oxidation and that they do so under conditions that differ from those controlling abiotic pathways. Seasonal epilimnetic pH decreases occurred in both years, decreasing from approximately 3.5 in May to 2.8 by September (2001) or July (2002). Epilimnetic acid generation rates were depth-dependent, with maximal rates observed not at the surface of lake where O-2 concentrations were highest, but rather within a geochemically reactive zone (approximately 1 m thick) of steep, decreasing O-2 gradients and dynamic Fe and S geochemistry in the lower epilimnetic region of the lake. Acid generation occurred dominantly through particle rather than aqueous pathways, but model predictions of acid generation via abiotic pyrrhotite oxidation involving either O-2 or ferric iron (Fe3+) predicted neither the observed rates nor the depths at which maximal rates occurred. In contrast, model predictions based on microbial pathways involving both O-2 and ferric iron (Fe3+) agreed extremely well with both the observed depth profile of H+ generation and the observed rates at any given depth. Imaging showed extensive microbial colonization of epilimnetic-associated pyrrhotite particles commonly with significant biofilm formation. FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) probing of the community in both pelagic and particle compartments indicated mixed communities occurred in both, and that Acidithiobacillus spp. accounted for 2-46% of the total community in either compartment. Initiation of pyrrhotite slurry discharge at the lake surface in 2002 was accompanied by a relative increase in the number of particle-associated microbes, as well as a relative proportional decrease of Acidithiobacillus spp. in the total microbial community. Given the widespread occurrence of bacteria across mining environments, the implications of our results extend beyond this specific site and provide new insight into bacterially driven processes contributing to bulk system characteristics which are not currently well constrained.					; Bernier, Luc/GXG-5136-2022	Bernier, Luc/0000-0002-5468-1548; 													1472-4677	1472-4669				APR	2005	3	2					115	133		10.1111/j.1472-4669.2005.00047.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-4669.2005.00047.x													WOS:000207171800004

The results showed that different levels of water discharge, turbidity, conductivity, TDS and nutrients could lead to the development of significantly different phytoplankton assemblages in inlets of shallow hypertrophic lakes. The multiple regression analysis identified water discharge, turbidity and water temperature as the driving factors behind the dynamics of phytoplankton biovolume in the studied inlets. The first two axes of Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) explained 78% of the total variance in dominant phytoplankton species at Sigirci Inlet and 88% at Koca ay Inlet, respectively. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationships between water discharge, temperature, conductivity, turbidity, pH, TDS, nitrate, ammonium, phosphate and the seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton assemblages of two inlets of the shallow hypertrophic Lake Manyas, Turkey by means of multivariate statistical analysis.

Potential effects of dietary lipid reduction on growth and reproduction of lake whitefish in Northern Lake Michigan	BIOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT OF COREGONID FISHES - 2005	Advances in Limnology				9th International Symposium on Biology and Management of Coregonid Fishes	JUL 21-AUG 27, 2005	Olsztyn, POLAND					We compiled information on the lipid content, growth, condition, population abundance and biomass, and recruitment of lake whitefish in Lake Michigan during 1976-2004 to evaluate whether a change in the benthic food web has reduced the amount of dietary lipids available for their consumption. Mean annual lipid content of skin-on fillets declined from 12.2% wet weight during 1977-1993 to 7.1 % during 1994-1999. The lowest lipid values occurred after 1994. There was a strong seasonal and spatial effect on lipid content. Growth rate was negatively related to population abundance but only weakly. The lowest growth rates occurred when lipid levels were low and population abundance and biomass were high. Population abundance and biomass of lake whitefish, and density of the amphipod Diporeia spp. explained only 22% of the variability in lipid levels, and population abundance explained the largest proportion of the variation in lipid levels. There was no evidence that recruitment was affected by reductions in lipids, growth, or condition. We suggest that the decrease in abundance of Diporeia spp. and the concomitant increase in colonization by dreissenid mussels may have resulted in a decrease in dietary lipid available to lake whitefish. We recommend that fishery agencies establish a dedicated program to monitor lipid content of lake whitefish. Managers must recognize that yields per recruit experienced during the 1980s and early 1990s cannot be sustained given the reduced production capacity of lake whitefish.																			1612-166X		978-3-510-47062-4				2007	60						311	+																WOS:000249090200025
J	Brandenberger, J; Louchouarn, P; Herbert, B; Tissot, P				Brandenberger, J; Louchouarn, P; Herbert, B; Tissot, P			Geochemical and hydrodynamic controls on arsenic and trace metal cycling in a seasonally stratified US sub-tropical reservoir	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												The phase distribution of trace metals and oxyanions, including U and As, in 2 surface water bodies was investigated within a South Texas watershed hosting a high density of surface U mine pits and tailings. The objectives of the study were to evaluate the environmental legacy of U mining, with particular emphasis on the spatial and temporal variability of water quality in Lake Corpus Christi, a downstream reservoir that serves as the major water resource to a population of similar to350,000 people in the region. Lyssy Pond, a livestock pond bordered by U mine tailings, was used as a model case-study site to evaluate the cycling of U mine-derived oxyanions under changing redox conditions. Although the pond showed seasonal thermal and chemical stratification, geochemical cycling of metals was limited to Co and Pb, which was correlated with redox cycling of Mn mineral phases, and U, which suggested reductive precipitation in the pond's hypolimnion. Uranium levels, however, were too low to support strong inputs from the tailings into the water column of the pond. The strong relationships observed between particulate Cr, Cs, V, and Fe suggest that these metals are associated with a stable particulate phase (probably allochthonous alumino-silicates) enriched in unreactive Fe. This observation is supported by a parallel relationship in sediments collected across a broad range of sediment depositional processes (and histories) in the basin. Arsenic, though selectively enriched in the pond's water column, was dominated by dissolved species throughout the depth of the profile and showed no sign of geochemical cycling or interaction with Fe-rich particles. Arsenic (and other oxyanions) in the water columns of Lake Corpus Christi and Lyssy pond were not affected by the abundant presence of Fe-rich particles but instead behaved conservatively. No evidence was found of anthropogenic impacts of U mines beyond the purely local scale. Arsenic's presence within the Nueces drainage basin is related to interactions between surface and groundwaters with U- and As-rich geological formations rather than large-scale transport of contaminants downstream of the U mine pits and tailings. A quantitative mass balance model, constructed using monthly hydrological data for the reservoir, provides quantitative evidence of seasonal evaporative concentration of As in surface waters demonstrating the predominance of hydrodynamic over geochemical constraints, on the cycling of this element.

At this arid site, the surface roughness varies between extremely smooth (salt lakes, clay pan) and very rough (alluvial fans, eroded salt formations). The moisture varies from very dry (alluvial fans) to wet (wet clay, salt crust with water ponds) with seasonal changes in certain areas. While the surface geometry is stable for certain surface types (alluvial fans, thick salt crusts), it changes for others as a result of the changing water level and erosion by wind and rain. The changing surface roughness, moisture, and vegetation conditions cause large variations of the backscattering and coherence. This information is used to distinguish different surface types, Furthermore, interferometry was used to map the topographic height.

J	Hu, FS; Ito, E; Brubaker, LB; Anderson, PM				Hu, FS; Ito, E; Brubaker, LB; Anderson, PM			Ostracode geochemical record of Holocene climatic change and implications for vegetational response in the northwestern Alaska range	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Trace-element analysis of the calcareous shells of ostracodes in a sediment core from Farewell Lake provides the first limnogeochemical record for climatic reconstructions in Alaska. When compared with pollen data from the same site, this record offers new insights into climatic controls over vegetation dynamics during the Holocene. The low Mg/Ca ratios and high Sr/Ca ratios suggest that a relatively cold dry climate prevailed in this region between 11,000 and 9000 pr B.P. (uncalibrated C-14 ages are used throughout the paper). This result contrasts with previous interpretations of a thermal maximum at this time, corresponding to the widespread establishment of Populus woodland/forest. The trace-element record suggests, instead, that the warmest period of the early Holocene at Farewell Lake was between 8500 and 8000 yr B.P. during the decline of Populus. Marked decreases in Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca suggest a major increase in effective moisture around 6500 yr B.P., which coincided with the establishment of Picea boreal forests in the Farewell Lake region, This climatic change was probably widespread throughout much of Alaska and adjacent Canada and might have induced the rapid spread of Alnus and the shift from Picea glauca to F. mariana dominance across that region. Our geochemical record also suggests that the late-Holocene climate history was more complex than previously thought on the basis of palynological studies, According to this record, growing-season temperatures increased 6000-4500 pr B.P., decreased 4500-1500 yr B.P., and increased with fluctuations afterward. After 6000 pr B.P. stratigraphic changes in pollen percentages of Picea appear to be positively related with those of Mg/Ca. This relationship implies that once the threshold of effective moisture was crossed for the establishment of Picea forests temperature was the primary control of Picea population density.

It is still at different stages for completion. Thirteen samples were collected from RBOD III and RBOD I (Hairdin Pumping Stations, Balochistan to Sehwan, Manchar lake, Sindh), and a reference sample was collected from river Indus at Kotri Barrage. The sampling scheme was repeated three times in 2009 and 11 samples were collected from RBOD I during 2018. The water samples were analysed for about 27-41 different parameters, including physicochemical, cations, anions, trace metals and the presence of microbiological organisms. The variation in the water quality was examined pre- and post-monsoon season and flows of water at Kotri Barrage. A significant variation was observed in quality of water pre and post monsoon. Higher concentrations were reported during pre-monsoon season. The water quality index (WQI) indicated that most of the samples were within poor water category for both drinking and irrigation purposes. Gibb's diagrams demonstrated that evaporation was dominant (85.7%) on the hydrochemistry of the water samples. The Cd, Pb, Ni, Cr and As crossed the permissible limits at a number of sampling stations. The water samples were also examined for multivariate analysis including principal component analysis (PCA), cluster analysis, piper diagrams and coefficient of variation. Chloride (Cl-) and sodium were dominant, followed by calcium, magnesium, sulphate and bicarbonate. The average values of analyses (n = 4) indicated RSD within 4.0%.

Effects of Chase Boat Use, Electrofishing Duration, and Water Velocity on Sample Efficiency and Size Structure of Blue Catfish	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Chase boats are used to assist in the capture of Blue Catfish Ictalurus furcatus because they often surface relatively far from the electrofishing boat (electrofisher) when incapacitated by low-frequency, pulsed DC. We conducted this study to determine how chase boat use affects size-related and capture efficiency metrics of Blue Catfish, and we concurrently examined possible confounding effects of sample duration and velocity on these metrics. We used DC at 15 pulses/s in 5- or 10-min runs during four trials that were stratified by reservoir zone, season, and macrohabitat over a 2-year period in Pool 10 of the Arkansas River (Lake Dardanelle, Arkansas). We captured 4,330 fish in 96 samples and analyzed the catch data by size-group (all fish; >199, >299, and >509 mm). We compared samples of fish captured by an electrofisher alone with those collected by the electrofisher in combination with a chase boat (chase+). The electrofisher-only protocol captured a greater proportion of fish less than 300 mm compared to the chase+ protocol, but length-frequency distributions of larger-size fish did not differ. Overall catch was greater for the chase+ protocol, with the difference generally increasing by size-group except for the largest fish. Catch efficiency was greater for 5- versus 10-min samples for both protocols, with the relative difference increasing as fish size increased. Calculated values of the proportional size distribution of quality-size fish were sufficiently similar among all combinations of protocol and duration for management purposes. The practical implication is that an electrofisher-only protocol can be used to collect representative samples of Blue Catfish, but the use of a chase boat increases the average catch per boat.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				OCT	2021	41			1	SI		S388	S399		10.1002/nafm.10599	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.10599		MAY 2021											WOS:000655829300001

A previous report documented the high viral abundance in Mono Lake, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis of viral DNA from lake water samples showed a diverse population based on a broad range of viral genome sizes. To better understand the ecology of bacteriophages and their hosts in this unique environment, water samples were collected between February 2001 and July 2004 for isolation of bacteriophages by using four indigenous bacterial hosts. Plaque assay results showed a differential seasonal expression of cultured bacteriophages. To reveal the diversity of uncultured bacteriophages, viral DNA from lake water samples was used to construct clone libraries. Sequence analysis of viral clones revealed homology to viral as well as bacterial proteins. Furthermore, dot blot DNA hybridization analyses showed that the uncultured viruses are more prevalent during most seasons, whereas the viral isolates (A phi and phi 2) were less prevalent, confirming the belief that uncultured viruses represent the dominant members of the community, whereas cultured isolates represent the minority species.

The assay is highly reliable and repeatable, and is probably the most sensitive assay for microcystin detection to date. Results of the survey indicated the presence of microcystins in the water samples, and the concentration of microcystins appeared to be related to the degree of eutrophication and water temperature. There is also a correlative relationship between the quantity of microcystins and the abundance of microcystin-producing cyanobacteria (Anabaena and Oscillatoria) in the water bodies over a year cycle. In the present study, the positive detection of microcystins in water bodies having no signs of algal bloom warns of considerable potential threat of these waters to public health.

Real Time PCR detection of Macrobrachium rosenbergii (de Man, 1879) larvae with emphasis to their ecology	AQUATIC LIVING RESOURCES												Species specific identification of early larval stages of many decapod crustaceans sampled from plankton collections remains cumbersome owing to lack of distinguishable characteristics, where DNA based molecular methods provide accurate results without taxonomic ambiguities. In the present study, an attempt was made to detect temporal occurrence of early zoea of freshwater prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii (de Man) using real-time PCR assays in polyhaline, mesohaline and oligohaline areas of a tropical positive estuary, the Vembanad lake (S. India). High caridean larval abundance could be recorded in polyhaline areas in all seasons while it could be recorded in monsoon season in mesohaline and oligohaline areas. 113 DNA isolations were successfully made from morphologically identified taxonomic units (MOTU) and SYBR Green based RT-PCR amplifications using designed primer for M. rosenbergii yielded positive detections in 38 samples (34%) representing all seasons in all three zones. Positive detections could be recorded in all months except May in mesohaline areas and differed significantly (F = 17.2 p < 0.01) with the same in polyhaline and oligohaline areas. The present results of molecular detection of M. rosenbergii larvae extend confirmation of its breeding ground in Vembanad lake where appropriate management strategies could be enforced for stock conservation of this species.

In this study, a systemic model for closed-loop LWHP systems was developed for the system performance analysis. Field measurements of the heat transfer coefficient of submerged coils were conducted under various conditions for the purpose of model application. The model has been used for the dynamic simulations of a closed-loop LWHP system in Zhuzhou, a city in south China. The daily average coefficient of performance of the system was found to be within the range of 2.8 to 3.2 in 183 days of the 229-day cooling and heating seasons. The influences of lake area and depth on system performance were analyzed through the comparisons among the hourly entering fluid temperatures in three scenarios. The comparison results indicate that deep lakes are more favorable for cooling performance improvement than for heating performance improvement. For two lakes with identical volume, the deeper lake is more favorable for cooling performance improvement than the larger lake except in September.

The aims of the present study were to study the geographical distribution of the calanoid copepod Boeckella brevicaudata (Brady, 1875) and the community structure of the zooplankton assemblages in which this species occurs. This last purpose was approached by applying null-models analyses based on species co-occurrence and niche-sharing. The species itself inhabits sub-Antarctic islands as well as southern South America. The results of the co-occurrence null model analysis revealed that the communities with this species have no regulating factors, whereas the niche overlap null model analysis revealed that these species share the same ecological niche. We thus found low abundances for all species, with specifically low B. brevicaudata abundance, at low mineral contents of the water. The results obtained were similar among sites in southern Argentinean and southern Chilean Patagonia, and on sub-Antarctic islands of which data were available.

Spatio-temporal changes in the rotifer plankton composition were examined in the main channel and its tributaries. The majority of species found are tolerant of a wide range of pH, whereas others prefer neutral to alkaline values. The total rotifer plankton density increased downstream from the headwaters to the middle sector of the river. The associated shallow lakes and tributaries were an important source of species. Variations in density and number of species were shown to be associated with conductivity, and species tolerant of high conductivity conditions were especially prevalent (upper 7,000 muS cm(-1)). Rotifer density was influenced by hydrological conditions, which promoted maximum values during low water periods and in the high water condition promoted the incorporation of species from shallow lakes connected with the river during flood events. The species associations found are related to such water parameters as conductivity and nutrient availability and to the presence of ponds and shallow, waterlogged depressions connected in varying extent to the main channel.

J	Carrick, HJ; Steinman, AD				Carrick, HJ; Steinman, AD			Variation in periphyton biomass and species composition in Lake Okeechobee, Florida (USA): Distribution of algal guilds along environmental gradients	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Many environmental factors (disturbance, resources, grazing pressure) collectively interact to influence periphyton abundance and species composition, particularly in large lakes where environmental gradients are commonplace. We assessed the link between variation in key environmental factors and changes in periphyton biomass and taxonomic composition in Lake Okeechobee, Florida, USA. Epiphyton and epipelon were collected quarterly from plant grab samples (10 sites) and sediment cores (15 sites) at fixed locations during 1994-95 (n = 98) in the lake. Samples were analyzed microscopically to estimate periphyton biomass and species composition, and physical and chemical conditions at each site were measured. Periphyton biovolume was high throughout the year (range epiphyton: 0.05-175 mm(3)/g and epipelon: 0.03-16 mm(3)/cm(2)) and was dominated by diatoms and cyanobacteria (30-50 % on average), with chlorophytes being subdominant (4-20 %). Although epipelic cyanobacteria were more abundant during the wet season (June-October), limited seasonal variation was observed for other groups, and this was attributed to the relatively constant climate characteristic of this subtropical geographic region. Both epiphyton and epipelon biovolume were greatest in protected inner marsh sites, while epipelon was also abundant in the pelagic zone where a meroplankton assemblage was dominant. Functional groups of species (guilds) were formed according to their adaptive response to changing resources and disturbance. In turn, algal guilds in Lake Okeechobee (flocculent, metaphyton, adnate, meroplankton mats) reflected local nitrogen and phosphorus inputs as mediated by strong lake-wide gradients in light penetration and physical disturbance.

J	Araki, S; Kunii, H				Araki, Satoru; Kunii, Hidenobu			Relationship between seed and clonal growth in the reproduction of Carex rugulosa Kuk. in riverside meadows	PLANT SPECIES BIOLOGY												Carex rugulosa Kuk. develops riverside vegetation in brackish marshes along the lower parts of rivers. Because the rhizomatous ramets grow densely (590-950/m(2)) in its developed population, it is expected that seedlings cannot get enough light to grow if seeds germinate in crowded ramets. We studied the reproductive contribution of seed in a marshy meadow of the Ohashi River, Japan. The number of seeds produced was 6900-14 200/m(2) in 2002. The number of buried seeds in the following germination season differed among sites from 1190 to 2690/m(2). No seedlings were observed at plots where the ramets from rhizomes grew densely. In contrast, seedlings appeared in plots where all rhizomatous ramets were artificially cut. The number of seedlings corresponded to 17.5-39.5% of that of buried seeds. All these seedlings were submerged and died when it rained heavily. In the genotype analysis using allozyme detection, one of the phosphoglucoisomerase loci (Pgi-2) indicated a pair of alleles. Among eight plots (each plot was 50 or 60-cm square), four showed an excess of heterozygotes and two showed homozygote domination in the Pgi-2 genotype. These results suggest that: (i) seed germination is suppressed in crowded ramets; (ii) seedling survival is severely reduced by inundation; and (iii) the population is usually maintained by clonal growth. As germination is induced in open areas, it is hypothesized that the main role of seed is recovery after vegetation decline caused by environmental stresses or colonization to other areas without dense vegetation.																			0913-557X					AUG	2008	23	2					81	89		10.1111/j.1442-1984.2008.00216.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-1984.2008.00216.x													WOS:000257757900003

However, there is still limited information about viral abundance and ecology in the rivers. We studied virioplankton abundance in relation to bacterial abundance, chlorophyll a (Chl a; expressed as total Chl a, Chl a in green algae, and in cyanobacteria), and environmental parameters (inorganic nutrient concentration, temperature) in two Czech rivers throughout a 6-month period. Viral abundances reached similar values in both rivers and ranged from 1.85 to 58.1 x 10(6) viruses/ mL and from 1.68 to 47.4 x 10(6) viruses/mL in the Svratka and the Morava River, respectively. The temporal variations in viral and bacterial abundances were large in both rivers, as they varied by more than one order of magnitude during the study. We did not observe a spatial variability in viruses or other biotic parameters in spite of differences in some environmental parameters within each river and also between the two rivers. Significant cross-correlations among viruses, bacteria, Chl a, and orthophosphate concentration were found, suggesting that these parameters may influence viral abundance and dynamics in the rivers.

J	O'Driscoll, MA; Parizek, RR				O'Driscoll, MA; Parizek, RR			The hydrologic catchment area of a chain of karst wetlands in central Pennsylvania, USA	WETLANDS												Shallow depressions found in karst terrains may contain wetlands (karst pans) that fluctuate seasonally in response to climatic conditions. This study examined the ground-water hydrology of a chain of 17 wetlands, ranging in size from 0.06 to 0.4 hectares, located in an Appalachian karst valley in central Pennsylvania, USA. The study objective was to determine the contributing area of wetland source waters. A variety of hydraulic head, soil stratigraphy, and water chemistry-data indicate that the combined contributing areas of these wetland ponds extend to a maximum distance of approximately 150 in from the ponds. The hydrologic catchment area of the ponds during January and February, 1999 (approximately 2-8 hectares) was significantly smaller than catchment area based on topography (69 hectares). The water source of the wetlands consists of direct precipitation inputs and shallow (0.5-6 m) perched ground water. The hydrologic catchment area of the ponds expands during wet periods and contracts during dry periods. The ponds have been shown to be perched above the regional water table.																			0277-5212					MAR	2003	23	1					171	179		10.1672/0277-5212(2003)023[0171:THCAOA]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1672/0277-5212(2003)023[0171:THCAOA]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000181785300016

The lakes Iso Hietajarvi and Pieni Hietajarvi are shallow headwater lakes situated in the Patvinsuo National Park, eastern Finland. Lake Iso Hietajarvi was weakly stratified during the open water season in 1988-2001, in contrast to Lake Pieni Hietajarvi, which was always strongly stratified mainly because of its wind-sheltered location and dark water. During the long study period, the main changes in water quality have been slight increases of alkalinity and pH-value and also some decrease of the nitrate content. The phytoplankton (wet) biomass in surface water varied from 0.07 to 0.51 mg l(-1) in Lake Iso Hietajarvi and from 0.18 to 0.60 mg l(-1) in Lake Pieni HietaJarvi in 1991, during the intensive weekly sampling. The biomass was mainly composed of Cryptophyceae, Chrysophyceae and Bacillariophyceae in Lake Iso Hietajarvi, and Cryptophyceae in Lake Pieni Hietajarvi. In Lake Iso Hietajarvi, the differences in the vertical distribution of phytoplankton biomass and species composition were small and the productive layer reached down to 4 m, whereas in the dark coloured Lake Pieni Hietajarvi the productive layer was shallow, less than or equal to1 m. When the whole productive water column is considered, the unstratified clear water Lake Iso Hietajarvi is more productive than the stratified dark coloured Lake Pieni Hietajarvi. The seasonal succession of phytoplankton species composition is different in these adjacent takes; more variation was found in the unstratified Lake Iso Hietajarvi compared to the smaller stratified lake.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV 15	2003	506	1-3					237	245		10.1023/B:HYDR.0000008555.92238.91	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000008555.92238.91													WOS:000188455600032

Five developmental stages-developing, ripening, ripened, spawning and spent-were encountered in both populations. The dominant stages were ripening and spawning, whereas spent gonads were rare. Males and females were nearly equally represented in the White Volta River stock, but the Oti River stock had more females than males. Hermaphrodites were encountered occasionally in both populations. By the end of the dry season (March-April), gonad development in both populations had progressed to the ripening stage, suggesting that they began active differentiation much earlier. From May through June, when the rains began and intensified, spawning had begun and was progressing. It was not possible to establish the limits of the breeding season because sampling was limited to only part of the year.					; Yankson, Kobina/AAH-2514-2020	AMPOFO-YEBOAH, AKWASI/0000-0003-2426-7239; 													1608-5914					AUG	2009	34	2					195	200		10.2989/AJAS.2009.34.2.11.898	http://dx.doi.org/10.2989/AJAS.2009.34.2.11.898													WOS:000269753500011
J	Báldi, A; Kisbenedek, T				Báldi, A; Kisbenedek, T			Bird species numbers in an archipelago of reeds at Lake Velence, Hungary	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY												1 Bird species numbers were studied on 109 reed islands at Lake Velence, Hungary, in the 1993 and 1994 breeding seasons. The aim was to describe and account for the abundance and distribution patterns of the bird species. 2 It was expected that an exponential model would fit the calculated species-area curves. However, for the 1993 data, both the power function (LogS similar to LogArea) and the exponential (S similar to LogArea) models did so, while the power function, exponential and linear (S similar to A) models fitted the curves for the 1994 data. 3 The results showed that the pattern was not random: a collection of small islands held more species than a few large islands with the same total area. 4 The relative species richness of small islands is a result of the preference of most common passerine bird species for the edges of reed islands. Most individuals were found in the first 5 m of the reedbed, and no edge avoidance was detected on a local spatial scale. Large, rarer species (e.g. Great White Egret), however, were found to be dependent on large reed islands. 5 Comparison of results with two other studies on bird communities of reed islands revealed that the type of landscape matrix (e.g. deep water, shallow water or agricultural lands) among reed patches significantly influences bird communities. Deep water was dominated by grebes and coot, shallow water by reed-nesting passerines, and farmed areas by reed- and bush-nesting passerines.

The Alto de San Nicolas is a topographic high south of the Campo de Talampaya depression, where extensive Neogene rocks crop out (52degrees / 18-6degrees). The Desencuentro Formation belongs to the upper section of the Alto de San Nicolas Group and has been recognized by satellite images and field control. A section of 1104 m has been surveyed and bivalves, ostracods, charophytes, wood, and vertebrates not previously mentioned have been recorded. Part of them are very close to a notorious tuff layer dated 7.4 +/- 0.9 My. This continental sequence corresponds, from base to top, to an alluvial braided plain and aeolian fine sandstones (paleowind from NE), which becomes a sandy braided fluvial system (paleocurrent directions toward NE), followed by a sandy-silty fluvial plain that culminates with shallow lake deposits with invertebrates and charophytes. These deposits are covered by sandy braided river deposits (paleocurrents to the NW). The fossil fauna and flora together with the sedimentological information indicate general temperate to warm climatic conditions with marked seasonality.

SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												In the tectonically stable area of the Egyptian coast of the Red Sea, the uppermost marine deposits of the Last Interglacial (Eemian, 5e = 5.5 Marine Isotopic Substage) consist of two contrasting sedimentary units: a subcontinuous fringing coral reef and, on its backward side, shelly and subaqueous gypsum deposited in erosive depressions elongated parallel to the shore. The entrenched geometry and the marine to brackish evolution of the pre-evaporite faunas indicate that during this very short period of time, a brief sea-level drop responsible for the limited erosion separated the succession of reef to marine gypsum and that the coastal area underwent several climatic variations. The marine ingression into drowned valleys (early MIS 5.51) developed khor environments (non-brackish lagoon on the Arabic arid shores) which were quickly replaced by highly restricted conditions leading to gypsum precipitation. Permanence of the salina waters and seasonal lamination interrupting crystal growth suggest an anchialine salina system (littoral haline lakes) fed by permanent seeping of sea-water, balanced by refluxing dense brines. A semi-arid climate is assumed, with seasonal rains allowing limited continental sulphate contribution (from Miocene gypsum outcrops). Both climate and sea-level changes were responsible for the complex evolution of this area. Compiled data enable generalization concerning the climatic oscillations during the Last Interglacial sedimentation. A model derived from these Red Sea Quaternary deposits, as an analogue for the marginal Miocene evaporite deposits in the Mediterranean and Red Sea, is discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The purpose of this study was to analyze the relative proportions of biotic and abiotic processes in the uptake of phosphorus by streambed sediments and their response to exogenous carbon (sodium acetate) concentration gradients, as well as explore the effects of WWTP effluent discharges on the biotic and abiotic uptake potential of phosphorus by streambed sediments in the receiving streams. Methods Experiments were undertaken with streambed sediments collected from four different sites in different seasons, with or without the addition of a chloroform solution (biological inhibitor), to which were added different concentrations of a source of carbon (sodium acetate). After completing the indoor simulation culture, the total uptake potential (SPUlive), abiotic uptake potential (SPUabiotic), and biotic uptake potential (SPUbiotic) of phosphorus by the sediments were calculated. Results The SPUlive values of the sediments in the receiving section of the WWTP effluent were higher than those at the control site and gradually decreased with the flow direction. A larger amount (c. 79.04-98.11%) of the added phosphorus was taken up abiotically by the sediments with no added carbon. The SPUbiotic value of all sampling sites increased with the increase in exogenous carbon concentration by the addition of acetate, and accordingly the maximum contribution rate of the biotic uptake of phosphorus in sediments was 14.83-36.40%. Conclusions Although WWTP effluents can increase the risk of release of phosphorus from sediments to the overlying water, the abiotic and biotic uptake potential of phosphorus by sediments is significantly increased by sediment-nutrient interactions. There may be more serious carbon limitations in the uptake of phosphorus by streambed sediments downstream of WWTPs than those at the reference site.

It was previously reported that the upper Great Lakes have received toxaphene by gas absorption following long-range transport from the south and are currently saturated with respect to toxaphene. However, the rate of loss of toxaphene from Lakes Michigan and Superior had been estimated using sparse or estimated data, and thus, these estimates had high uncertainties. For this investigation, samples were collected to provide extensive data on air, water, and sediment concentrations of toxaphene for the upper Great Lakes for the period 1997-98. These data were used to calculate the annual an seasonal fluxes of toxaphene from water to air and sediment. Lake Superior is 200-1000% saturated with toxaphene, and Lake Michigan is 200-500% saturated. It seems clear that both lakes will outgas toxaphene into the atmosphere for some considerable time in the future, and Lake Superior, because of its generally lower water temperatures and higher toxaphene concentration, will outgas toxaphene even longer than will Lake Michigan.																			0013-936X					SEP 15	2001	35	18					3653	3660		10.1021/es0019631	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es0019631								11783641					WOS:000171055400010
J	Stannard, DI; Rosenberry, DO; Winter, TC; Parkhurst, RS				Stannard, DI; Rosenberry, DO; Winter, TC; Parkhurst, RS			Estimates of fetch-induced errors in Bowen-ratio energy-budget measurements of evapotranspiration from a prairie wetland, Cottonwood Lake Area, North Dakota, USA	WETLANDS												Micrometeorological measurements of evapotranspiration (ET) often are affected to some degree by errors arising from limited fetch. A recently developed model was used to estimate fetch-induced errors in Bowen-ratio energy-budget measurements of ET made at a small wetland with fetch-to-height ratios ranging from 34 to 49. Estimated errors were small, averaging - 1.90% +/- 0.59%. The small errors are attributed primarily to the near-zero lower sensor height, and the negative bias reflects the greater Bowen ratios of the drier surrounding upland. Some of the variables and parameters affecting the error were not measured, but instead are estimated. A sensitivity analysis indicates that the uncertainty arising from these estimates is small. In general, fetch-induced error in measured wetland ET increases with decreasing fetch-to-height ratio, with increasing aridity and with increasing atmospheric stability over the wetland. Occurrence of standing water at a site is likely to increase the appropriate time step of data integration, for a given level of accuracy. Occurrence of extensive open water can increase accuracy or decrease the required fetch by allowing the lower sensor to be placed at the water surface. If fetch is highly variable and fetch-induced errors are significant, the variables affecting fetch (e.g., wind direction, water level) need to be measured. Fetch-induced error during the non-growing season may be greater or smaller than during the growing season, depending on how seasonal changes affect both the wetland and upland at a site.

J	Gevao, B; Jones, KC; Hamilton-Taylor, J				Gevao, B; Jones, KC; Hamilton-Taylor, J			Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) deposition to and processing in a small rural lake, Cumbria UK	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												PAH concentrations were determined in a dated sediment core collected from Esthwaite Water (EW), a seasonally anoxic lake in the English Lake District. The most dramatic variations are associated with increased PAH fluxes from similar to 1900 and a sub-surface maximum (similar to 29 mg m(-2) year(-1)) in the late 1960s to early 1970s, followed by a fivefold decrease in fluxes to the sediment-water interface. This trend is believed to reflect enhanced fossil fuel burning, followed by general improvements in combustion technologies, shifts in the fuels used for domestic space heating and the implementation of various emission controls on releases from certain known PAH sources. When the relative contributions from individual compounds to the Sigma PAH were plotted as vertical profiles, coherent time trends emerged. Perylene dominated the pre-1900 sedimentary PAH composition, contributing > 75% to the Sigma PAH mixture. The perylene profile provides good evidence for both natural and anthropogenic sources to EW. The ratios of annual sediment trap fluxes to surficial sediment accumulation rates are substantially greater than one for the low molecular weight compounds, suggesting release at or near the sediment water interface and subsequent recycling of these compounds. Recycling was found to increase with increasing solubility and decreasing log K-ow. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Studies to offer opportunities to monitor long-term changes in the area by using advanced technology economically and effectively are expected to guide decision makers. In the present study, the changes in surface area of Erzurum Plain Wetland were investigated between 1998 and 2017 by using remote sensing techniques. As a result of the change analysis conducted using Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM, and Landsat 8 OLI satellite data, it has been determined there is an expansion in deep and shallow water areas of the wetland. According to the results of the study, deep water areas expanded by 118.64% in 28 years. During this period, the total of deep water and shallow water reed areas increased by 9.08%. In the period of 1989-2017, the total area of the Erzurum Plain Wetland consisting of deep water, shallow water/reeds, and wet meadow/soil parts grew by 26.88%. In the study, the effects of change and human activities on this surface area change were also examined and it was found as a result of the evaluation that more than climatic factors, change of hydrological structure caused by increase in underground water reserves may be effective on the expansion.					; İrdemez, Şahset/AAA-7628-2021	Irdemez, Sahset/0000-0002-0205-4630; 													0167-6369	1573-2959				MAY	2021	193	5							265	10.1007/s10661-021-09041-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-021-09041-x								33855614					WOS:000640197000001

Floating communities, many of Vietnamese descent, are being relocated onto lands in the vicinity. Examining the situation through a lens of both human rights and sustainable development goals reveals a complexity of rights, duties and obligations. A holistic approach to relocation, including ecological approaches to living and working on the water (and indeed land) may ameliorate some elements.

Small mammals were sampled using Sherman traps along 200 m transects (with one trap at every 10 m interval) in each of four habitats (cropland, forest patch, scrubland and wetland) replicated twice. Additional trapping was carried out in rural settlements comprising of eight homesteads, with five traps per homestead. Trapping was conducted in three sessions during the agricultural seasons: rainy (October), off-rain (December) and dry (February) over two years (2018 and 2019). In each session, trapping was carried out for three consecutive nights. A total of 497 small mammals belonging to 12 species from four families (Soricidae, Macroscelididae, Gliridae and Muridae) were captured. Murine rodents accounted for 99.4% of the animals with Mastomys erythroleucus (58%) being the dominant species. The scrubland had the highest small mammal species diversity while the cropland had the lowest. M. erythroleucus was not strongly associated with any spatio-temporal parameter and scored majority of seasonally reproducing individuals in the cropland, signifying its pest importance. Though disconnected from protected areas, habitats such as the scrubland harbor diverse small mammal species (including a vulnerable-endemic species, Grammomys minnae), suggesting the habitats' significance for ecosystem functioning and conservation.

Isotopic signatures of POM showed seasonal variations, which was assumed to be associated with allochthonous organic input and autochthonous phytoplankton growth. delta C-13 of H. leucisculus was 1.1 % higher than that of POM, which suggested that the food source of H. leucisculus was mostly from the POM. A mass balance model indicated the trophic position of H. leucisculus in the food web of Yangtze River was estimated to be 2.0 - 2.1, indicating that this fish mainly feeds on planktonic organic matter, which agreed with previous gut content analysis.

In this study we experimentally estimated seasonal variability in individual photosynthesis, community production and growth in biomass of the charophyte Chara aspera in the Baltic Sea together with the key environmental variables known to regulate the production of macroalgae. The experiments suggested that the production and growth of C. aspera was defined largely by light and temperature at all studied scales. However, the algal production at the same light levels was systematically lower at the community than an individual level, suggesting the importance of shelf-shading and below-ground processes in natural plant assemblages. Moreover, the observation scale also defined response types between the environment, plant production and growth. This implies that the patterns of variability of the production and growth of macrophytes should always be interpreted in the context of scale and any multiscale model development should involve experimental validation at all important scales.					; Kotta, Jonne/B-5542-2009; Paalme, Tiina/GXF-8043-2022	Kotta, Jonne/0000-0002-4970-6755; Ratsep, Merli/0000-0002-2841-7452; Torn, Kaire/0000-0002-7490-5238														2296-7745				APR 30	2021	8								674014	10.3389/fmars.2021.674014	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2021.674014													WOS:000651377400001

Lots of research about the effect of climate change on physiological growth processes, water consumption and food production are crucial to ensure food security. Numerous crop-water models have been adapted to analyse the response of physiological growth and water requirement to meteorological factors, but reports differ in various regions. The variations in yield (Y) of early and late rice, growth season duration (SD) and climatic factors were investigated based on data collected in the Poyang Lake basin from 1987 to 2016. Furthermore, the variation in rice water requirement (ET) and its response to Y, SD and climatic factors were analysed. The results showed that the climatic factors varied insignificantly, while the mean (T-am), maximum (T-ah) and minimum (T-al) air temperatures increased significantly during early and late rice growth periods. SD increased insignificantly for early and late rice, and Y increased insignificantly for early rice and significantly for late rice. ET increased significantly from 1994 to 2003 and decreased significantly from 2004 to 2014 for both early and late rice. Variation in SD, cumulative temperature (T-aa) and sunshine hours (h(s)) mainly led to increased ET for early and late rice; variation in T-am, T-ah, relative humidity (RH) and Y led to reduced ET for early and late rice.

J	FerrazVicentini, KR; SalgadoLabouriau, ML				FerrazVicentini, KR; SalgadoLabouriau, ML			Palynological analysis of a palm swamp in Central Brazil	JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES												A 281 cm core collected in a palm swamp in Central Brazil yielded ages from more than 32,400 radiocarbon years B.P. to about 3,500 B.P. The palynological analysis indicates changes and oscillations in the climate during this time. At more than 32,400 years B.P. a palm swamp (Mauritia) and a gallery forest occupied the coring site and an arboreal cerrado (savanna-like vegetation) occurred in the region around the studied area. This indicates a vegetation similar to the present, suggesting a warm semi-humid climate with four to five months dry season as at present. At the end of the Middle Pleniglacial (32,400 to ca. 28,300) trees and shrubs started to decline in the region. From ca. 27,000 to ca. 20,000 B.P. the palm swamp was replaced by a shallow lake and a grassland occupied the region. This phase was humid and probably colder than the preceding two phases and the present climate. The decrease of pollen, spores and algae concentration from ca. 18,500 to ca 11,300 suggests a dry and perhaps cold phase at the end of the Pleistocene. The dryness (but not the cold) continued from ca. 10,500 until ca. 7,700 and the site was burned during this phase, suggesting the dry season was longer than at present. From 6,680 to ca. 3,500 B.P. the Mauritia swamp, the gallery forest and the arboreal cerrado started to return to the region indicating an increase in humidity. There is no record from there to the present because of present human disturbance. The occurrence of abundant charcoal particles in the older sediments suggest that natural fires burned the cerrado several times during the Pleniglacial time, although the palm swamp was not directly burned. The presence of charcoal particles in the beginning of the Holocene could be in part produced by human occupation of the land. Comparison is made with results of other palynological analyses from cerrados and savannas of northern South America.

J	Rosenberger, AE; Chapman, LJ				Rosenberger, AE; Chapman, LJ			Hypoxic wetland tributaries as faunal refugia from an introduced predator	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												The introduction of Nile perch (Lates niloticus) into the Lake Victoria basin of East Africa has coincided with the decline or disappearance of hundreds of indigenous species. To mitigate additional biodiversity loss, we must learn what limits the spread of Nile perch and what habitats serve as refugia for prey species. Heavily vegetated wetlands may protect fishes from Nile perch predation by providing both structural and low-oxygen refugia for prey species tolerant of hypoxia. To examine the potential of wetlands as refugia we quantified the composition, persistence, and stability of fish assemblages in a wetland tributary of Lake Nabugabo, a satellite lake of Lake Victoria in which Nile perch have been introduced. Nile perch were extremely rare in the wetland, and nine of the 18 species that have disappeared from the open waters of the satellite lake were captured in the tributary in this study. Dissolved oxygen was chronically low in the river and may be important in shaping fish community characteristics. Faunal attenuation occurred as the dry season progressed and oxygen levels dropped; however, the most common species remained through seasonal changes. The chronically low oxygen conditions in the wetland tributary may permit persistence of only hypoxia-tolerant species. However, wetland conditions seem to limit exploitation by Nile perch providing critical refugia for a subset of the basin fauna.

SEM images of reacted surfaces display an array of reaction textures, which are interpreted to represent a five-stage (T1-T5) paragenetic alteration sequence. Leached pyrrhotite surfaces are initially featureless (T1 texture). Surfaces leached more extensively develop a mottled felty texture (T2). Subsequent drying of reacted surfaces causes dehydration, producing cracked, tiled surfaces (T3 textures). Prolonged drying intensifies the effects of desiccation, producing rubbly (T4) textures. The rubble is readily spalled, exposing smooth underlayers (T5 textures). AES and XPS data collected from T1 through T4 textured surfaces indicate primarily Fe-oxyhydroxide reaction products. AES depth profiles show that S varies antipathetically with oxygen. AES analysis of T5 textured surfaces (underlayer exposed by spalling) detect only Fe and S, with S significantly enriched over Fe. XPS and modelled AES data show T5 textured regions are mainly ferric iron bonded to disulphide and/or polysulphide species. The accumulation of S in the underlayer is accomplished by preferential migration of Fe to the overlying oxyhydroxide layer to the pyrrhotite surface, thus, promoting spallation. Spalling of Fe(III)-oxyhydroxides is promoted in waste rock dumps and tailings situated above the water table by periodic wetting, drying, and desiccation of the oxyhydroxide layer. These circumstances may, in turn, lead to high concentrations of suspended Fe-oxyhydroxide in tailings ponds during flooding and in ponds where there are dramatic seasonal overturns of lake or pond water. Exposure by spalling of S-rich sublayers to aqueous solutions is an effective means for producing sulphuric acid-rich mine waste runoff, and of producing periodic flushes of sulphuric acid-rich drainage waters.																			0016-7037					DEC	1994	58	23					5147	5159		10.1016/0016-7037(94)90300-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(94)90300-X													WOS:A1994PX17000005
J	Robson, B				Robson, B			Representing the effects of diurnal variations in light on primary production on a seasonal time-scale	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Rates of production by primary producers are strongly affected by light. Diurnal variations in irradiance produce characteristic diurnal patterns in primary production and respiration. In cases in which the processes of interest occur on a longer time-scale, it is not uncommon to ignore diurnal variations and use mean daily irradiance to force models of primary producers. This simplification reduces the computer processing time and input data requirements of models. However, this approach results in an error which may be significant if irradiance during part of the day is higher than that needed for growth at the maximum possible rate. Here, an alternative approach is presented and applied to a simulation of phytoplankton in a shallow lake. The model uses a semi-analytical calculation of mean daily growth rates that takes into account periods of supersaturation with respect to light to deliver results that conform closely to those of a model using hourly time-steps and irradiance forcing, but with a substantially smaller computational cost.

J	SEMENIUK, CA; SEMENIUK, V				SEMENIUK, CA; SEMENIUK, V			A GEOMORPHIC APPROACH TO GLOBAL CLASSIFICATION FOR INLAND WETLANDS	VEGETATIO					IV International Wetlands Conference on Wetlands - Old World and New World	1992	COLUMBUS, OH					A geomorphic classification of inland wetlands on criteria other than vegetation is proposed, based on their host landform and degree of wetness. Thus, the classification addresses the underlying structure of most inland wetlands, i.e. their landform setting and their various types of hydroperiod. Landforms host to wetlands include: basins, channels, hats, slopes and hills/highlands. Degrees of wetness include: permanent, seasonal or intermittent inundation, and seasonal waterlogging. From combining the landform type with hydroperiod, thirteen primary types of common wetlands are recognized: 1. permanently inundated basin = lake; 2. seasonally inundated basin = sumpland; 3. intermittently inundated basin = playa; 4. seasonally waterlogged basin = dampland; 5. permanently inundated channel = river; 6. seasonally inundated channel = creek; 7. intermittently inundated channel = wadi; 8. seasonally waterlogged channel = trough; 9. seasonally inundated flat = floodplain; 10. intermittently inundated flat = barlkarra; 11. seasonally waterlogged flat = palusplain; 12. seasonally waterlogged slope = paluslope; and 13. seasonally waterlogged highlands = palusmont. Water, landform and vegetation descriptors can augment the nomenclature of the primary units: e.g. salinity of water; size and shape of landform; and organisation, structure and floristics of vegetation. The classification can be used in many settings, regardless of climate and vegetation types. Using the approach adopted in this classification, in principle, more landform types and degrees of wetness, if necessary, can be added to the system to define additional wetland types.																			0042-3106					JUN	1995	118	1-2					103	124		10.1007/BF00045193	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00045193													WOS:A1995RW03600009

The Socotra cormorant Phalacrocoraxn igrogularisi Is a regionally endemic seabird restricted to the Arabian Gulf and coastal Oman, and is categorized as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. The species is perceived as being detrimental to local fisheries and is therefore persecuted. We studied the diet and estimated the number of Socotra cormorants breeding on Siniya Island, Umm Al Quwain, United Arab Emirates, to determine their impact on local fisheries. Regurgitated fish loads were collected during the breeding seasons of 2011-2012 and 2012-2013, and the biomass of fish consumed by the Socotra cormorant population was estimated. The diet comprised seven species of fish, with sailfin flying fish Parexocoetus mento and blue-stripe sardine Herklotsichthys quadrimaculatus dominating in 2011-2012 and anchovies (Encrasicholina spp.) dominating in 2012-2013. Biomass of fish loads was higher in 2011-2012 compared to 2012-2013, although mean biomass of fish loads did not differ. Dominant fish species in the cormorant's diet were either used as baitfish or were non-target species in the fisheries. The low overlap between the diet of the Socotra cormorant and the fish landed by the fisheries suggests that the cormorant's impact on fisheries is minimal. Conservation strategies to protect the birds and their feeding areas could safeguard populations of this species from further declines.					; Muzaffar, Sabir/AAP-7176-2020	Muzaffar, Sabir/0000-0001-9195-1677; 													0030-6053	1365-3008				JAN	2017	51	1					115	123		10.1017/S0030605315000666	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0030605315000666													WOS:000392222700023

Comparison of ecosystem processes in a woodland and prairie pond with different hydroperiods	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Shallow lakes and ponds constitute a significant number of water bodies worldwide. Many are heterotrophic, indicating that they are likely net contributors to global carbon cycling. Climate change is likely to have important impacts on these waterbodies. In this study, we examined two small Minnesota ponds; a permanent woodland pond and a temporary prairie pond. The woodland pond had lower levels of phosphorus and phytoplankton than the prairie pond. Using the open water oxygen method, we found the prairie pond typically had a higher level of gross primary production (GPP) and respiration (R) than the woodland pond, although the differences between the ponds varied with season. Despite the differences in GPP and R between the ponds the net ecosystem production was similar with both being heterotrophic. Since abundant small ponds may play an important role in carbon cycling and are likely to undergo changes in temperature and hydroperiod associated with climate change, understanding pond metabolism is critical in predicting impacts and designing management schemes to mitigate changes.

However, field investigation and geotechnical analysis are limited by sparse instrumentation and high cost. Here we use time-series Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) method to map out the settlement over the entire tailings impoundment area in the vicinity of Great Salt Lake (Utah) using multiple SAR data. We show that the south pond is experiencing quasi-linear settlements with the largest rate of 200+ mm/yr at the northeast corner. InSAR observations can be well-explained by geotechnical consolidation model, which reveals and predicts the gradually decelerated settlement process. InSAR-derived displacement maps also highlight active motions of surrounding infrastructures, such as some highway segments. Nevertheless, there is no clear evidence that the fluctuating deformation at those locations and seasonal varied water level are correlated.					; Lu, Zhong/MZQ-2483-2025; Wang, Teng/H-4767-2019; OOMMEN, THOMAS/C-3315-2008	Kim, Jin-Woo/0000-0002-9097-2465; Lu, Zhong/0000-0001-9181-1818; 													2153-6996		978-1-5090-4951-6				2017							40	43																WOS:000426954600011

Shallow lakes are an essential component of the Argentine Pampean wetlands. The Sauce Grande shallow lake is a typical water body of the Argentine Pampean wetlands, based on its shallow characteristics and its homogeneity in terms of physical, chemical, and biological characteristics. Phytoplankton is dominant in the turbid shallow lake and is sensitive to internal fluctuations in the water body and prevailing environmental conditions that affect its abundance and distribution. Goals. We conducted a temporal and spatial analysis of the distribution and abundance of the phytoplankton community in the Sauce Grande shallow lake (province of Buenos Aires, Argentina), from April to September 2012, in order to study the influence of physicochemical variables of the water on phytoplankton. Methods. We undertook Cluster Analysis (CA), Principal Component Analyses (PCA) and Spearman correlations between the biotic and physicochemical variables recorded at two sites of the shallow lake. Results. The multivariate analysis showed that certain water physicochemical factors (conductivity, depth, pH, turbidity, and temperature) profoundly influenced the phytoplankton dynamics, giving rise to a seasonal succession of community species, with a clear dominance of Cyanobacteria. The Spearman correlation showed that Cyanobacteria relate positively and significantly to conductivity whereas Chlorophyta and Bacillariophyta relate negatively and significantly to temperature, pH, conductivity, and salinity. Chlorophyta was the group with the highest number of recorded taxa while Cyanobacteria constituted the largest group, the most abundant species being Synechocystis salina Wislouch. Conclusions. The results obtained in this study demonstrate that the phytoplankton community of the Sauce Grande shallow lake is highly susceptible to changes in water environmental conditions, in particular to water level fluctuations, and to conductivity, pH, and temperature.																			0188-8897						2017	27	1					93	102		10.24275/uam/izt/dcbi/hidro/2017v27n1/Cony	http://dx.doi.org/10.24275/uam/izt/dcbi/hidro/2017v27n1/Cony													WOS:000410073900010

The diatom communities were diverse; 88 taxa were found, belonging to the Bacillariophyta. Cymbella minuta, Cyclotella ocellata and Encyonema silesiacum have become the most abundant organisms in the epilithon. Environmental variables together with biological data obtained during the monthly routine biomonitoring of epilithic samples in the dam were analysed to understand variability of epilithic diatom communities and their relationships with environmental variables. Moreover, cluster analysis was applied to the epilithic algal communities and the seasonal variations of the samples were classified according to their similarity levels. Speciess richness and shannon diversity of the samples which were counted were measured in monthly periods. The results of the diversity analysis and the counting did not exactly match up with each other. Multivariate analyses indicated that both the regional distribution and seasonal variation of some epilithic diatoms (e.g. Cymbella spp., Nitzschia spp., Amphora delicatissima) are mainly driven by nutrient concentrations. Furthermore, epilithic diatoms are predominantly affected by geochemical characteristics including pH and total alkalinity (CaCO3) levels.

Structured water balance methodology for water consumption estimation for a mining operation in central Chile: seasonal temperature effect on evaporation, seepage and water demand	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MINING RECLAMATION AND ENVIRONMENT												Due to rising demand, mining operations are facing increasing restrictions regarding freshwater intake. This research develops a general structured methodology to estimate freshwater requirements for a mill plant operation in central Chile. This involves determining water consumption using a general mass-balance algorithm, determination of evaporation and seepage rates, and development of a daily time-step water balance model that accounts for water demand, storage and losses in tailings. The water balance model is applied to estimate water well needs, being accurate in relation to the preceding operational year and thus useful for predicting water requirements.

Water bodies like dams, lakes, ponds play major role in storing and distributing the water in efficient manner. Stored water is used for drinking purpose, agriculture irrigation, electricity generation, etc. Sometimes excess storage of water causes flood during heavy raining season and kills valuable resources including human life. This mandates that the water bodies should be frequently monitored and controlled for the benefits of mankind. Water body monitoring involves the quantity and quality of water stored, input and output water flow through inlet and outlet shutters respectively, condition of the inlet and outlet shutters, condition of the channels carry the water to oceans during flood, etc. Conventional manual monitoring of water bodies consists several disadvantages including high manual overhead, low accuracy and excess time in measurements, high communication delay, high cost, life threatening risks during measurements, etc. The objective of the proposed work is to automatically monitor and control the smart water bodies to sort out the disadvantages of conventional monitoring. The proposed system consists of Remote Monitoring and Control Station (RMCS), Field Control Unit (FCU), Patrol Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (PUAV), different floating sensors like rainfall sensor, water quality sensor, inlet and outlet shutter interfaces, alarms. The proposed system is able to monitor the water body frequently and prepares accurate report that includes quantity of water, rainfall rate, input and output water flow rate, quality of water like existence of any poisonous chemical contents, working condition of the inlet/outlet shutters, etc. This report is quickly sent to the RMCS for further actions. The RMCS can pull the complete report or any particular information on demand. Further the RMCS processes the report to extract the knowledge for further actions like opening/closing shutters, replacing damaged sensors, directing PUAVs to capture the pictures, sending messages to field officials and operators, etc. As a whole, the proposed system significantly reduces the manual overhead, cost, time required to measure/check various factors while increasing the accuracy of measurements and enables the remote monitoring unit to monitor and govern the water body in all aspects.					; B., Bharathi/GXV-8824-2022; A, SAMSON ARUN RAJ/AAT-8831-2021	, Bharathi/0000-0001-7279-5357; A, SAMSON ARUN RAJ/0000-0001-5090-5199; 															978-1-5090-4799-4				2017							116	120		10.1109/ICRTCCM.2017.85	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICRTCCM.2017.85													WOS:000427184100021

Sampling campaigns were carried out in three lakes from the Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve. Spectral analysis of specific phytoplankton pigments was applied as a diagnostic marker to establish the distribution and composition of phytoplankton taxonomic groups. Fluorescence spectroscopy was used to quantify changes in dissolved organic matter (DOM). The relative contribution of the main phytoplankton groups to the total phytoplankton biomass and the trend of development during succession of the seasons showed that cyanobacteria could raise potential ecological or human health problems. Moreover, fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that Cryptophyta and cyanobacteria were the main contributors to the protein-like components of DOM. It was concluded that fluorescence could be used to provide a qualitative evaluation of the eutrophication degree in Danube Delta lakes.

J	Mogge, B; Kaiser, EA; Munch, JC				Mogge, B; Kaiser, EA; Munch, JC			Nitrous oxide emissions and denitrification N-losses from forest soils in the Bornhoved Lake Region (Northern Germany).	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY												In situ denitrification N-losses and nitrous oxide emissions were measured over 12 months from a beech and a drained black alder forest of Northern Germany. Annual N-losses from the alder forest soil were approximately 15 times greater than from the beech forest soil (denitrification: 7.0 vs 0.4 kg N ha(-1) y(-1); nitrous oxide: 4.9 vs 0.4 kg N ha(-1) y(-1), respectively). These results were attributed to the soil moisture content, and contents of nitrate and water-soluble organic C compounds in the alder forest soil being significantly greater than in the beech forest soil. The ratio denitrification N-losses-to-nitrous oxide emissions revealed high denitrifier activity in the alder forest soil while in the beech forest soil nitrification predominated. The time course of nitrous oxide emissions and denitrification N-losses on both sites were similar and underwent seasonal changes. The best predictor for the emissions of the alder forest soil was the soil temperature (r(2)=0.63 and 0.44 for nitrous oxide and denitrification, respectively).

Lipid fractions were characterised so as to determine their origin, speciation, variability in individual rivers, and their flux to the lower Orinoco River. Aliphatic hydrocarbons, ketones, alcohols, triterpenoids, and fatty acids were ubiquitous in the rivers, and a large proportion of these compounds were found to be autochthonous in origin. The relative loadings of particle-associated and dissolved lipids were of the same order of magnitude in most of the rivers, indicating the importance of the dissolved phase. Apparently, true equilibria between water and particulate phases were not reached, probably as a result of the high amounts of colloidal and humic materials associated with the dissolved phase in most of the rivers. Preliminary data indicate that there were considerable seasonal variabilities in the distributions and concentrations of lipids in some of the rivers, but that each of these showed different behaviour.

Various aspects of the species' ecology were investigated. Past records of the species were almost always associated with population irruptions following exceptionally wet years. Aspects of population dynamics, fine-scale habitat use, activity ranges and burrows were studied and related to habitat condition during three dry seasons following a good season. Both areas were associated with floodout plains in a gibber desert environment but differed in soils and vegetation structure. The population dynamics and structure and home-range activity also differed. These differences appeared to relate to the availability and distribution of food and shelter in the respective locations. The differences between populations in the two areas are discussed with reference to the source/sink and refugia concepts.					; Moseby, Katherine/AAR-3301-2020	Moseby, Katherine/0000-0003-0691-1625; 													1035-3712	1448-5494					1999	26	4					541	564		10.1071/WR97049	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WR97049													WOS:000080893300010
J	Hellsten, M; Lagergren, R; Stenson, J				Hellsten, M; Lagergren, R; Stenson, J			Can extreme morphology in Bosmina reduce predation risk from Leptodora?: An experimental test	OECOLOGIA												Bosmina (Cladocera) populations, especially within the subgenus Eubosmina, show a variety of phenotypes that exhibit large differences in body size and shape and antennule length. In some populations, the morphological traits also vary during the season, with the most extreme forms occurring in periods with high densities of certain invertebrate predators. However, while temporal phenotypic variation in other cladocerans, as in the family Daphnidae, has been shown to be an adaptation to reduce the risk of predation by invertebrate predators, the reason for such changes in Bosmina is much less clear. We examined whether certain morphological traits in Bosmina species could act as a defence against invertebrate predators. We tested three Bosmina forms (subgenus Eubosmina), differing in morphology from each other, which are found in lakes together with the predator Leptodora a kindtii (Cladocera). Bosmina (E.) longispina has a relatively low and elongated carapace with a caudal mucro, and short antennule, B. (E.) coregoni gibbera has a higher and more protruding carapace without caudal mucro, and a much longer antennule. Finally, B. (E.) coregoni retro extensa has a carapace like that of B. longispina but with no caudal mucro and a much longer antennule. In one experiment, B. longispina and B. gibbera were exposed for 12 h to Leptodora in Petri dishes. In a second experiment, we observed directly the escape efficiency of B. longispina, B. gibbera and B. retro extensa, and the handling time of Leptodora. The two Bosmina forms with more extreme morphological features had a lower death rate and higher escape efficiency than B. longispina. Prey that escaped did so, in most cases, within 5 min. Predator handling time was correlated to predator body length and antennule length of the prey. The results suggests that Bosmina species with extreme morphological traits may be less vulnerable to invertebrate predators.																			0029-8549					JAN	1999	118	1					23	28		10.1007/s004420050699	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s004420050699								20135157					WOS:000078353600004
J	Huddart, PA; Longstaffe, FJ; Crowe, AS				Huddart, PA; Longstaffe, FJ; Crowe, AS			δD and δ18O evidence for inputs to groundwater at a wetland coastal boundary in the southern Great Lakes region of Canada	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The stable isotope compositions (delta(18)O and delta D) of water have been used to determine the relative contributions of different water sources to the groundwater in a barrier sand-bar that separates a coastal freshwater marsh from Lake Erie, Canada. An extensive groundwater study was initiated by Environment Canada at Point Pelee National Park after elevated nutrient concentrations were measured in the park's marsh, located on a spit of land that extends 15 km south into Lake Erie. As part of this larger study, which includes groundwater and nutrient modelling, the stable isotope compositions (delta(18)O and delta D) of water have been used to independently determine the nature and extent of groundwater flow within sand deposits that separate the marsh from Lake Erie, One of the two study sites chosen for this investigation is located near a large septic-system tile-bed that receives human waste from a public toilet facility within the park, and could potentially release nutrients to the marsh via the groundwater. Both transects studied are well suited to isotopic investigation because they an located between two potentially recharging surface water bodies with temporally variable isotopic compositions, and because the transects are subject to recharge by local precipitation, which exhibits large seasonal isotopic variations. These differing isotopic compositions, when considered spatially and temporally, make it possible to establish the source and movement of groundwater within the transects. The oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions of surface waters from the Point Pelee marsh and Lake Erie lie on an evaporation line with a slope of 5.7. The isotopic composition of Lake Erie remained relatively stable for over 21 months (delta(18)O = -7.5 parts per thousand to -6.7 parts per thousand) whereas the marsh exhibited considerable spatial and temporal variability (delta(18)O = -8.4 parts per thousand to -0.1 parts per thousand). The delta D and delta(18)O values of precipitation samples vary seasonally with local surface temperatures, and constitute a local meteoric water line of delta D = 8.0(delta(18)O) + 9.8. While influx of precipitation is evident and similar in the upper two metres of both transects, the relative contribution to groundwater from Lake Erie and the Point Pelee marsh appears to differ. The average delta(18)O and delta D groundwater values measured for the narrower transect were -7.0 parts per thousand and -54 parts per thousand respectively, and reflect significant groundwater recharge from both Lake Erie (similar to 67%) and the marsh (similar to 28%), Precipitation constitutes the primary source of groundwater recharge to the wider transect, located near the large septic-system tile-bed, with average groundwater values of delta(18)O = -9.1 parts per thousand and delta D = -65 parts per thousand. The isotopic profile of groundwater in this area is very stable, both with depth and over time, and contrasts sharply with the narrower northern transect which is much more dynamic. These findings suggest that the septic-system tile-bed is well situated in the wider portion of the barrier sand-bar, where a larger head difference between the lake and the marsh would be required to produce groundwater flow equivalent to that observed in the narrower transect. The differences in groundwater recharge between the two sites arise primarily from the difference in width, and account for the 2 parts per thousand and 10 parts per thousand differences in delta(18)O and delta D values, respectively, measured in the base-flow groundwater of the two transects.

This approach comprised two parts: (1) a green-red band quasi-analytical algorithm, used to accurately derive the total absorption coefficient (a); and (2) the use of the retrievals from (1) are to semi-analytically retrieve a(CDOM). This approach for partitioning a(CDOM) from a was based on the blue band line height at 443 nm, LH(443), which uses the summed absorption coefficients of phytoplankton and CDOM (a(phc)) at three characteristic wavelengths (412, 443 and 490 nm). This proposed algorithm was then tested and validated using the three datasets. The algorithm was found to perform reasonably well in retrieving a(CDOM), with respective mean R-2 and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) values of 0.84 and 42.8%, compared with 0.64 and 72.9% for the empirical model and 0.40 and 66.2% for the extended quasi-analytical algorithm. Furthermore, the algorithm was able to retrieve a(CDOM) from Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) satellite data. One implication for the MERIS satellite data, which exhibit reasonable seasonal variability over the East China Sea, is that it can be used to explore biogeochemical effects on aquatic environments.

With missed opportunities to monitor environmental transitions at Lake Kenyir, our knowledge of lake transition is restricted to the non-mixing shallow waters only. Triplicate monthly benthic invertebrate samples were collected concurrently with various environmental parameters at three locations (zones A-C) of Kenyir Lake, Malaysia. Our results affirmed that the northeast part of Lake Kenyir is oligotrophic. Abundance of phytoplankton, total suspended solids, phosphate, nitrite and nitrate drive the abundance of various groups of benthic invertebrates. All of these extrinsic variables (except phosphate) negatively influenced the density of Trichoptera and positively influenced (P<0.05) the densities of Polychaeta, Oligochaeta, Bivalvia, Gastropod, Isopoda and Copepod in all zones. Phosphate negatively influenced the density of Trichoptera and positively influenced (P<0.05) the densities of Oligochaeta, Bivalvia and Copepod. Its influences on the Polychaeta, Gastropod and Isopoda densities were zone-specific. Overall, seasons equally influenced the relationships between extrinsic and response variables in all zones.

Simultaneously with the attenuation measurements, the principal absorption and scattering components of the water column were also measured. The elevated spatial resolution used in the study allowed the determination of spatially distinct optical water classes within the lake. Changes in dissolved organic matter, phytoplankton and tripton concentrations led to a wide variation in the vertical attenuation coefficients. These changes depended on local characteristics of the ecosystem and time of year. The spatial distribution of the attenuation coefficients was examined in relation to the hydrological and geomorphological characteristics of the littoral area of the lake. The impacts of two small rivers on the light environment and attenuation components are shown. Finally, the resulting model was used to examine the possible impacts of changes in light availability at the lake bottom in relation to recent changes in lake water level.					; Cozar, Andres/G-2141-2016; Loiselle, Steven/ABA-3324-2020; Cozar Cabanas, Andres/G-2141-2016; rossi, claudio/ACK-9713-2022	Loiselle, Steven/0000-0001-7414-0389; Cozar Cabanas, Andres/0000-0003-1370-9935; ROSSI, CLAUDIO/0000-0001-6032-1015; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	2005	534	1-3					181	191		10.1007/s10750-004-1504-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-004-1504-z													WOS:000227070700015
J	Fischer, P				Fischer, P			Nocturnal foraging in the stone loach (Barbatula barbatula):: Fixed or environmentally mediated behavior?	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												The hypothesis was tested that nocturnal foraging in the stone loach (Barbatula barbatula), a small benthic dweller in temperate rivers and lakes, gradually shifts to daytime foraging when fish are hungry and no acute predation risk is present. Foraging activity in stone loach always remained significantly higher during the night compared to the twilight and the day, independent of food availability, even after the fish had lost more than 20% of their initial body weight. The absolute levels of daytime activity significantly decreased, while nocturnal movements significantly increased. Activity stopped almost completely when a predator was present. Contrary to previous studies on epi-benthic or pelagic species, for which a gradual shift from nocturnal to daytime foraging has been demonstrated, stone loach did not adopt daytime foraging even when there was no acute daytime predation risk and the fish were starving. This indicates that in stone loach an anticipated rather than observed predation risk is taken into account when estimating the predation risk at any time of the day. Such a strict behavior might be especially important for benthic dwellers with a low swimming speed, and therefore escape potential, in relation to fast moving daytime predators.

J	Soupir, CA; Brown, ML; Kallemeyn, LW				Soupir, CA; Brown, ML; Kallemeyn, LW			Trophic ecology of largemouth bass and northern pike in allopatric and sympatric assemblages in northern boreal lakes	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE												Largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) and northern pike (Esox lucius) are top predators in the food chain in most aquatic environments that they occupy; however, limited information exists on species interactions in the northern reaches of largemouth bass distribution. We investigated the seasonal food habits of allopatric and sympatric assemblages of largemouth bass and northern pike in six interior lakes within Voyageurs National Park, Minnesota. Percentages of empty stomachs were variable for largemouth bass (38-54%) and northern pike (34.7-66.7%). Fishes (mainly yellow perch, Perca flavescens) comprised greater than 60% (mean percent mass, MPM) of the northern pike diet during all seasons in both allopatric and sympatric assemblages. Aquatic insects (primarily Odonata and Hemiptera) were important in the diets of largemouth bass in all communities (0.0-79.7 MPM). Although largemouth bass were observed in the diet of northern pike, largemouth bass apparently did not prey on northern pike. Seasonal differences were observed in the proportion of aquatic insects (P = 0.010) and fishes (P = 0.023) in the diets of northern pike and largemouth bass. Based on three food categories, jackknifed classifications correctly classified 77 and 92% of northern pike and largemouth bass values, respectively. Percent resource overlap values were biologically significant (greater than 60%) during at least one season in each sympatric assemblage, suggesting some diet overlap.																			0008-4301					OCT	2000	78	10					1759	1766		10.1139/cjz-78-10-1759	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-78-10-1759													WOS:000089523900009
J	Otvos, EG; Price, DM				Otvos, EG; Price, DM			Late quaternary inland dunes of southern Louisiana and arid climate phases in the Gulf Coast region	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Thirty-five sand hills that form six scattered groups rise abruptly from the hat late Pleistocene coastal plain in southeastern Louisiana. New studies confirm their eolian origin. For the first time, several late Wisconsin to early Holocene episodes of arid climate conditions have been recognized and dated in this currently humid warm-temperate subtropical region. Periods of dune formation and reactivation (28,800 to 7900 yr B.P) were determined by the thermoluminescence method. The onset of the current climate in this Gulf coastal region postdates early Holocene time. The textural and structural homogeneity of the ridge lithosomes, good sorting of their sand fraction, and the dominantly orange hues of the dune sediments contrast with the underlying yellowish-brown to light-brown sandy silts and the well-stratified, occasionally gravelly sands of the underlying alluvial Prairie Formation. Sharply defined, unconformable ridge bases; symmetrical, oval, occasionally parabolic mound shapes; and steep slopes confirm the dune origins. The dominant orientations of ridges and ridge chains clearly reflect paleowind directions. Age comparison with dunes of the lower Mississippi Valley, the northeastern-eastern Gulf of Mexico coast, and south Atlantic coastal areas confirms the existence of at least seasonally dry climate conditions from early Wisconsin to middle Holocene times. The onset of the modem humid-subtropical climate phase in this region thus dates back only to the middle Holocene.

N2O was measured from seawater at 23 sampling stations (n = 178). Nitrate (NO3-), nitrite (NO2-), ammonium (NH4+), oxygen (O-2), water temperature and salinity were also determined. N2O was supersaturated in all surface seawater; the surface N2O saturation ranged from 116 to 1630%. Both the high concentration of surface N2O in the low salinity region and absence of significant spatial deviation in the distribution of N2O with season suggested that the main source of N2O was input of fresh water; discharge of treated sewage waters containing N2O in the bay area is probably the main source of the observed high concentrations of N2O in seawater there.

J	ROMANOWICZ, EA; SIEGEL, DI; CHANTON, JP; GLASER, PH				ROMANOWICZ, EA; SIEGEL, DI; CHANTON, JP; GLASER, PH			TEMPORAL VARIATIONS IN DISSOLVED METHANE DEEP IN THE LAKE AGASSIZ PEATLANDS, MINNESOTA	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												A study (August 1990 to July 1991) of profiles of dissolved CH4 concentrations, diffusive flux of CH4, and CH4 production rates of 45 sites in the Lake Agassiz Peatlands in northern Minnesota shows that dissolved CH4 deep in the peat (> 1 m depth) mobilized easily to the vadose zone. During August 1990 the dissolved CH4 concentrations at some depths at some sites were supersaturated with respect to one atmosphere partial pressure of CH4. At one site (2.5 m depth) the concentration of dissolved CH4 in the peat pore-water was 140 mg L(-1). In July 1991, at no site did the concentration of dissolved CH4 in the peat pore water exceed 40 mg L(-1) in the peat profile. The average calculated diffusive flux of CH4 decreased from 95 to 45 mg m(-2) d(-1) between 1990 and 1991. Gaseous CH4 was more in evidence in 1990 than in 1991. In 1990, CH4 at many depths bubbled vigorously when pear pore water was sampled. At some sites there was sufficient pore pressure to eject slugs of water forcibly from piezometers. Similarly, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) consisting of H2CO3, CO2, HCO3- and CO32- decreased between the sampling times from an average for both bogs and fens in 1990 of 62 mg C L(-1) to 38 mg C L(-1) in 1991. A dynamic mechanism must exist which traps CH4 deep in the peat column allowing gaseous CH4 to build up, increasing dissolved CH4. Other times, CH4 passes freely from deep peat to the vadose zone. We suggest as a hypothesis that a confining layer of trapped CH4 bubbles forms at depth in the peat, trapping gaseous CH4. The duration of the ''bubble confining layer'' is uncertain. We propose two hypotheses. (1) The confining layer is usually present and deteriorates after a major climatic event such as a drought, or (2) the confining layer forms and collapses seasonally with seasonal variations in the water table elevation.																			0886-6236					JUN	1995	9	2					197	212		10.1029/95GB00634	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/95GB00634													WOS:A1995TE97400003

Within this community, various Cryptomonas species, primarily C. erosa (Ehrenberg), C. erosa var. reflexa (Marsson), and C. rostratisformis (Skuja), diurnally migrated as indicated by in situ fluorescence monitoring and direct phytoplankton enumeration. The Cryptomonas spp. typically resided near the oxic-anoxic boundary of the water column; however, they actively migrated upward during the day and descended to lower anoxic locations at night, apparently responding to diurnal changes in their local habitat. Their nocturnal environment had moderate levels of sulfide, elevated secondary nutrients, and a community of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria, whereas their daytime environment had higher light, lower nutrients, and no local photosynthetic bacteria. Monitoring indicated that the Cryptomonas spp. migration was generally linked to daily variations in absolute light intensity (e. g. sunny vs. cloudy days) and the level of other potentially growth-limiting resources, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus. However, further analyses showed that the primary factor that determined whether the Cryptomonas spp. migrated or not on a given day was the slope of the light gradient immediately above the Cryptomonas spp. peak.

At 37 degrees C, the C-13 isotope effect for the reaction acetate (methyl carbon) --> methane, as measured in replicate experiments with M. barkeri, was -21.3 parts per thousand +/- 0.3 parts per thousand. The isotope effect at the carboxyl portion of acetate was essentially equal, indicating participation of both positions in the rate-determining step, as expected for reactions catalyzed by carbon monoxide dehydrogenase. A similar isotope effect, -19.2 parts per thousand +/- 0.3 parts per thousand, was found for this reaction in the natural community (temperature = 20 degrees C). Given these observations, it has been possible to model the flow of carbon to methane within lake sediment communities and to account for carbon isotope compositions of evolving methane. Extension of the model allows interpretation of seasonal fluctuations in C-13 contents of methane in other systems.																			0099-2240					FEB	1994	60	2					467	472		10.1128/AEM.60.2.467-472.1994	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.60.2.467-472.1994								11536629					WOS:A1994MU32200012
J	Blukacz, EA; Sprules, WG; Brunner, J				Blukacz, EA; Sprules, WG; Brunner, J			Use of the bootstrap for error propagation in estimating zooplankton production	ECOLOGY												Error propagation is the calculation of statistical error in a quantity that comprises multiple components each with associated error. Such quantities constitute the end point of many ecological studies, but composite errors are rarely incorporated so that uncertainty in the final estimate is either unknown or underestimated. In this study we present the use of both parametric (observations are resampled from standard probability distributions) and nonparametric (raw observations are resampled) bootstrap techniques to propagate errors through the many steps involved in the egg-ratio estimation of seasonal production for the freshwater zooplankter Bythotrephes longimanus. We first compute parametric and nonparametric bootstrap estimates of the standard deviation in seasonal production of B. longimanus, showing that it ranges from 21% to 27% of observed seasonal production. We demonstrate that our bootstrapping procedures are robust by developing a theoretical model and showing that the true variance of a parameter is included in 96% of the simulated 95% confidence intervals. We also show that the choice of probability distribution in the parametric bootstrap can change the standard deviation of seasonal production by up to 90%. We argue that ecologists should use such error propagation techniques more routinely than is currently the case.																			0012-9658					AUG	2005	86	8					2223	2231		10.1890/04-0772	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/04-0772													WOS:000231075400029
J	Stewart, KA; Lamoureux, SF; Forbes, AC				Stewart, KA; Lamoureux, SF; Forbes, AC			Hydrological controls on the diatom assemblage of a seasonal arctic river: Boothia Peninsula, Nunavut, Canada	HYDROBIOLOGIA												This study characterizes the melt season diatom assemblage of a middle arctic river with respect to hydrological conditions. In addition, the potential to identify species that show a strong affinity for the lotic environment provides an opportunity to interpret stratigraphic changes in these species in the lake sedimentary record in terms of past hydrological change. Understanding long-term hydrological variability is critical for assessing both current and future environmental change. Significantly higher relative abundances of Achnanthes minutissima Kutzing, Fragilaria capucina var. vaucheriae (Kutzing) Lange-Bertalot, Diatoma tenuis Agardh, Cymbella arctica (Lagerstedt) Schmidt, C. minuta Hilse ex. Rabenhorst, C. silesiaca Bleisch and Encyonema fogedii Krammer in the lotic environment throughout the 2001 growing season compared to the lacustrine sedimentary record suggest that these species characterize the Lord Lindsay River diatom assemblage. Comparison of seasonal abundances of these taxa to hydrological parameters including discharge, electrical conductivity, and water temperature reveal key information about the character of this community. The fact that the river diatom assemblage changes very little throughout the sampling period, despite major changes in hydrological conditions, suggests a degree of resilience and inherent structure in the community. However, a decrease in diatom biomass in response to rapid and dramatic changes in hydrological conditions following a major rainfall event suggests that a threshold tolerance may exist, with potentially important implications for interpreting stratigraphic changes in the palcoenvironmental record.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				AUG 1	2005	544						259	270		10.1007/s10750-005-0864-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-005-0864-3													WOS:000231958500021
J	Smith, IR				Smith, IR			Diamictic sediments within high Arctic lake sediment cores: evidence for lake ice rafting along the lateral glacial margin	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Sediment cores from six small lake basins in the Canadian high Arctic reveal a gravel-rich (less than or equal to 30% by weight) to gravel-poor (greater than or equal to2%) diamict facies underlying massive, post-glacial, clayey silt. Ten other lakes contain a second diamict facies within what are interpreted to be glaciolacustrine sedimentary assemblages. The sedimentology, clast fabrics and fossil remains (diatoms, ostracodes and chironomid head capsules) within both diamict facies suggest that these deposits are not tills. Clast fabrics yielded low S-1 (0.41-0.57) and high S-3 (0.09-0.22) eigenvalues, placing them within the range of ice-rafted diamictons and glacigenic sediment flows. The high percentage of clast dip angles > 45 degrees (15-61%), random clast azimuth and lower diamict contacts conformable to underlying current-bedded sediment favours an origin as a rain-out or settling deposit. Samples of the matrix and scrapings of clasts from the diamicts revealed a diatom assemblage dominated by littoral and planktonic forms, such as are found in the littoral regions of the lakes today. This contrasts sharply with the assemblages within the overlying clayey silt, in which benthic forms predominate. Clasts are thus interpreted to have been rafted from the littoral areas of the lake. The process proposed to explain this is rafting by the lake ice cover in a glacial-marginal environment. Early season meltwater, impounded along the lateral margin of retreating cold-based glaciers, would buoyantly lift the lake ice cover and any adfrozen lake sediment. Higher lake levels and increased areal extent of seasonal freeze-on between the lake ice cover and the lake bed would allow the redeposition of littoral sediments to the benthic regions through greater lateral shifting of the ice cover as it broke up. Incision by meltwater streams into the lateral glacial margins would later isolate the lake, allowing seasonal warming of lake water, enough to support the growth and maturation of the ostracode and chironomid species found as fossils within the diamicts.																			0037-0746					DEC	2000	47	6					1157	1179		10.1046/j.1365-3091.2000.00347.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-3091.2000.00347.x													WOS:000165910800006

Females were larger than males in each separate year, but mean growth rate was higher in males than in females. This discrepancy was due to different age distributions, with 64.5% of the males migrating after four or five growing seasons, while 86.3% of the females grew for 10-15 seasons before migration. Otolith length in the glass eel stage was independent of sex, and it was not correlated with year of migration. With focus on median year of migration, otolith lengths after one, two, and three growing seasons were significantly larger in males than in females. This was mainly due to a higher otolith length increase during the first growing season, i.e., before the eels were stocked in the lake. These results are inconsistent with the view that female eels generally grow faster than males.

Siebels and K. Mendgen. Microscopical analysis of conidiophore formation enabled the earlier detection of resistance and a clearer distinction between DMI-resistant and DMI-sensitive populations than other in vivo methods commonly used to analyze inhibitory effects of fungicides. In addition, because observations were made on the level of individuals, quantitative measures of the composition of conidial populations were obtained. The development of DMI sensitivity was followed over a period of 3 years in control apple orchards that had never been treated with fungicides and in orchards with DMI history. The 50% effective dose values determined by microscopical evaluation of conidiophore development for untreated populations revealed the baseline sensitivities of 0.3, 0.96, 0.09, 1.22, and 1.92 mg/liter for flusilazole, fenarimol, difenoconazole. tebuconazole, and pyrifenox, respectively. As compared with the baseline sensitivity, all populations with DMI history showed significant resistance to flusilazole, A strong nonlinear correlation (R = 0.96) was found between the resistance factors and the sum of all DMI treatments of the 3 years before taking the sample. According to this correlation, resistance can be expected in all apple orchards of the fruit-growing area along Lake Constance, Germany, in which more than two DMI treatments per season have been applied. Due to cross-resistance, the recently introduced DMI fungicides difenoconazole, tebuconazole, and pyrifenox did not allow the control of V. inaequalis populations resistant to flusilazole.

They were sampled for hormones, tagged and released in the center of lake. Fish were again sampled at recapture to characterize changes in steroid hormone levels in individual migrants as well as homing percentage and duration in each month. All males returned faster than females early in the breeding season, although a half of the tagged males did not return to the natal site late in the season (November). A high percentage of females always returned, and homing duration shortened late in the season. In males, the shortening of homing duration coincided with an increase in serum testosterone (T) and 11-ketotestosterone levels. In females, the shortening of homing duration corresponded to an elevation of serum T and 17 alpha,20 beta-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (DHP) levels, and a drop in serum estradiol-17 beta levels. Sustained administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog (GnRHa, via implants) in September greatly shortened homing duration, especially in females. GnRHa treatment caused a dramatic increase in serum DHP levels in both sexes on average. Individual GnRHa-treated males which rapidly returned, however, showed higher serum T levels and lower serum DHP levels than slower returning males. The present study indicates sexual differences in homing profiles as well as shortening of homing duration following GnRHa implantation in lacustrine sockeye salmon in Lake Shikotsu which may be reflective of changes in serum steroid hormone levels.

Despite higher levels of nutrients, chlorophyll and primary production in the inner harbor (IH), the areas supported similar May to November zooplankton biomass (IH = 32 +/- 7 and CA = 42 +/- 10 mg/m(3)). IH values were much lower than other nutrient-enriched embayments in Lake Ontario, yet CA biomass was twice that of nearshore sites away from Toronto. Small zooplankton such as rotifers and Bosmina dominated IH; and large taxa (Daphnia, calanoids and predatory cladocerans) were more important in the CA. Daphnia, Bosmina, cyclopoids and calanoids were larger in the CA, and adult cyclopoids had higher egg ratios. This led to low annual IH production estimates for both cyclopoid and calanoid copepods. Total phosphorus and chlorophyll did not appear to regulate zooplankton biomass, but positive relationships were found with bacterial biomass in the IH and with temperature in the cool season. Atypically high fish planktivory rates likely suppressed larger IH zooplankton in 2016, allowing small, resilient Bosmina to flourish and contribute 84% of total production in the IH. Comparing 2016 data to previous zooplankton surveys revealed considerable inter-annual variation in proportions of Daphnia, Bosmina and predatory cladocerans over the 1994 to 2016 period, and the strong top-down controls observed in 2016 were not typical. Elevated microbial production may serve as an important alternate trophic pathway supporting cladoceran populations in Toronto Harbour.

In the first portion of the study, adult male smallmouth bass were hooked and then played either briefly (<20 s) or to exhaustion (2 min). White muscle acid-base and metabolite status were used as indicators of the extent of the physiological disturbance in these fish. Angling of smallmouth bass resulted in decreases in muscle pH and energy reserves for burst activity (phosphocreatine and adenosine triphosphate), as well as increases in muscle lactate, metabolic protons (Delta H-). and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2). The physiological disturbance was most severe in smallmouth bass played to exhaustion. In the second portion of the study, other adult male smallmouth bass were hooked and played as described above. Fish played to exhaustion took four times longer to return to their nets than did fish played briefly. As a result, offspring in the nest of fish played to exhaustion were exposed to more predation risk. The physiological and behavioral effects of exhaustive exercise induced by angling indicate the potential for catch-and-release angling of smallmouth bass Juring their spawning season to negatively affect reproductive success.																			0002-8487					JAN	1995	124	1					70	76		10.1577/1548-8659(1995)124<0070:EOCARA>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1995)124<0070:EOCARA>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1995RB06900006

The cockle species Lymnocardium soproniense Vitalis, apparently evolving through a sympatric speciation event in the sublittoral zone of Lake Pannon about 10.2-10.3 Ma, attained wide geographical distribution in the Pannonian basin and thus may serve as a good stratigraphic marker. Lymnocardium soproniense was one of the few large-sized cockles in Lake Pannon, most closely related to its ancestor, L. schedelianum (Fuchs), and to another descendant of the latter, L. variocostatum Vitalis. According to the delta O-18 stable isotope record of its shells, the large size of L. soproniense was coupled with an extended life time of more than 10 years, probably reflecting a stable lake environment with increased resource availability and decreased predation. The species lived in quiet offshore conditions, below the storm wave base, where clay was deposited from suspension and the influence of currents was negligible. The base of the Lymnocardium soproniense Zone in the sublittoral deposits of Lake Pannon is defined by the first occurrence of the species, whereas the top of the zone is marked with the base of the overlying Congeria praerhomboidea Zone, defined by the FAD of C. praerhomboidea.

Seasonal variations of water quality in a highly populated drainage basin, SE Brazil: water chemistry assessment and geochemical modeling approaches	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The Sao Joao Drainage Basin is a very important and strategic waterbody located in the Lagos Region, Rio de Janeiro State, one of the most popular tourist regions of Brazil. However, the fast economic and subsequent population growth in that region has created untreated wastes from several anthropogenic activities, which include the trace metals disposal into the surface waterbody. This study aims to relate the major ions and trace metals behavior during a 1-year sampling campaign and to provide information about the sources of chemical constituents and the factors that control their concentrations in the three main fluvial compartments of the drainage basin, including the Juturnaiba Reservoir which has a crucial role for water supply in the Lagos Region. The chemical data reveal that rainfall is the main factor responsible for the physicochemical parameters and the water dissolved constituent's variations. The geological and anthropogenic factors which are the main sources of water constituents were assessed by the Inorganic Chemical Index. Those data corroborate the great influence of rainfall and reveal the importance of anthropogenic sources of chemical constituents in some parts of the Juturnaiba Reservoir. The geochemical modeling suggests that hydrolysis reactions are primarily responsible for the trace metals availability in the three fluvial compartments in both dry and wet seasons, followed by carbonate and sulfate complexation.

Influence of egg oiling on colony presence of ring-billed gulls	HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS												Egg oiling is a form of management in which bird eggs are coated with mineral or corn oil, preventing gas exchange through the shell and killing embryos. Unlike other nest-disturbance techniques, egg oiling reportedly precludes colony abandonment and, thus, can be advantageous when managers wish to limit dispersal within the breeding season to other locations while stabilizing the population or reducing productivity. However, unintended, indirect effects of egg oiling are not well-characterized. We evaluated the influence of egg oiling on ring-billed gulls (Larus delawarensis) within the Lake Champlain basin, Vermont, during the nesting season to determine whether egg oiling affected colony presence of adults. We radio-marked 58 ring-billed gulls captured on Young Island during 2008 to 2009 and treated all ring-billed gull nests in the colony with egg oiling except for 50% of the nests of radio-marked gulls (control group). Using a radio receiver with automated data logger, we documented the presence of ring-billed gulls at the colony throughout the breeding season. We examined effects of treatment (nests oiled or control), sex, reproductive period (pre- and post-hatch), year, and interactive effects on colony presence (i.e., the proportion of nights ring-billed gulls spent at Young Island). Although we found no effect of treatment, sex, or interactive effects on colony presence, colony presence was 87% greater in the pre-hatch period, presumably due to behavioral mechanisms related to incubation or foraging. Overall colony presence was 118% greater in 2009 than in 2008, potentially a consequence of increased colony disturbance in 2008. We suggest that egg oiling does not influence colony presence of ring-billed gulls within the breeding season.					; Belant, Jerrold/HDM-7749-2022	DeVault, Travis/0000-0001-6413-1104; 													1934-4392	1936-8046				SPR	2014	8	1					22	30																WOS:000339815800002

Surveys covered typical Madagascar Fish Eagle habitat: lakes, rivers, mangroves, estuaries, and marine islands within their known distribution. In total, 287 individuals were encountered, including 98 breeding pairs (196 individuals), 23 breeding trios (69 individuals), 15 single adults and seven immature birds. Of these 287 birds, 128 individuals (44.6%) were observed on lakes; 116 (40.4%) in coastal areas, consisting of 103 (35.9%) in mangroves and 13 (4.5%) in estuaries; 32 (11.2%) on marine islands and 11 (3.8%) on rivers. There was an increase between surveys in 1995 and this study in the number of Madagascar Fish Eagles counted, from 222 to 287, and in the number of pairs from 99 to 121. This study confirms that the Madagascar Fish Eagle population is still low due to human persecution (hunting, collection of eggs and nestlings), overfishing and habitat destruction. We recommend monitoring fish eagles annually at the higher concentration sites to evaluate human activities and conducting a population survey every five years throughout western and northern Madagascar.																			0959-2709	1474-0001				MAR	2014	24	1					88	99		10.1017/S0959270913000038	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0959270913000038													WOS:000336602600007

Using four large enclosures placed in a eutrophic, thermally stratifying lake, we studied the effects of the structure of the planktonic food web (with and without planktivorous fish, +/- F treatments) and nutrient concentration (with and without fertilisation, +/- N treatments) on P sedimentation. We investigated the total P content and P binding forms in settling material (TPSM) and of the uppermost 1 cm sediment layer (TPSed) during three consecutive stratification periods (2005-2007). Additionally, epilimnetic P (SRPEpi, TPEpi), chlorophyll a and biomass of total crustacean and Daphnia were measured. On a seasonal scale, Daphnia biomass tended to negatively influence chlorophyll a, sedimentation rate of total particulate matter and of P, but the latter two criteria did not differ significantly between treatments due to large fluctuations within each enclosure. The contents of TPSM and loosely adsorbed P in settling material decreased in the following order: -F/+N>+F/+N>-F/-N>+F/-N, indicating greater effects of nutrient addition than of food web structure. In sediments, organically bound P was 9-23% higher in -F variants compared to the corresponding +F treatments, thus indicating an effect of food web structure. Furthermore, positive correlations between SRPEpi, TPEpi, TPSM, TPSed, sediment reductant-soluble P and calcite bound P revealed an effect of the epilimnetic P concentration on P sedimentation and specific P binding forms. Compared to the composition of different P binding forms in the settling material, a considerable decrease of loosely adsorbed P (12-26%) and reductant-soluble P (14-21%), as well as an increase of organic P (14-26%) were observed in the uppermost 1 cm-layer of the sediments in all treatments. We conclude that both nutrient enrichment (+N) and food web structure (-F) enhance the P sedimentation and P content at the sediment surface. However, in addition to food web effects on organic P content in settling matter and sediments, factors like iron concentration and calcite precipitation might be of importance for P sedimentation and storage in sediments in complex systems such as lakes.

Habitat features associated with Barrow's Goldeneye breeding in eastern Canada	WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												We investigated environmental variables linked to presence of Barrow's Goldeneye (Bucephala islandica) pairs from the eastern North American population on 412 lakes of the Sainte-Marguerite River watershed, Quebec, Canada. We analysed habitat relationships at two spatial scales (i.e., considering all lakes surveyed and high elevation lakes only) and predetermined the high elevation lakes as those including 90% of Barrow's Goldeneye occurrences. Barrow's Goldeneye were found on 59 lakes, all of which were >= 490 m elevation (maximum = 822 m) with 90% at >= 610 m. Six variables tested using multivariate logistic regressions contributed to explain the occurrence of goldeneyes. Four were significant (P < 0.10) in both the complete and the high elevation data sets: nest boxes (+) and brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) (-) occurrences, altitude (+), and the interaction between altitude and mean slope (+). The models explained only a small proportion of Barrow's Goldeneye occurrence for both data sets (R-2 = 0.27 and 0.23, respectively). The negative relationship between Barrow's Goldeneye and brook trout occurrences, and the positive relationship with altitude probably reflect a positive relationship between goldeneye and highly productive aquatic ecosystems. Barrow's Goldeneye from eastern North America primarily use high altitudinal, productive lakes during the breeding season, which emphasizes the importance of fishless lakes for that population at risk.																			1559-4491	1938-5447				JUN	2008	120	2					320	330		10.1676/07-009.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1676/07-009.1													WOS:000256411000010

Psammon Rotifera in a mesotrophic Lake Kuc (Masurian Lakeland, Northern Poland)	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Is inshore, 2-cm layer of wet sand an ecotone? An attempt of this study is to answer the question by analysing characteristic patterns of a structure of rotifer communities inhabiting the psammolitoral zone. Psammon was sampled from sandy shore of a mesotrophic Lake Kuc (Masurian Lakeland, Poland), weekly from May to November 1996 and on one occasion in May 1998. Despite of extremely unfavourable conditions of their abiotic habitat, psammon rotifers of Lake Kuc were reaching occasionally extremely high densities. Seasonal dynamics of numbers and structure of psammon rotifer communities reflected variable character of their habitat. A course of the changes was similar in less variable higropsammon and extremely variable eupsammon. Patterns formed in psammolittoral - when illustrated with qualitative and quantitative features of psammon rotifer communities - fit definitions of an ecosystem, an ecotone; a part of a land/water ecotone, a microlayer in the ecosystem or a specific boundary zone in the lake ecosystem.																			1505-2249						2003	51	2					219	224																WOS:000183729900012
J	Kaste, O; Stoddard, JL; Henriksen, A				Kaste, O; Stoddard, JL; Henriksen, A			Implication of lake water residence time on the classification of Norwegian surface water sites into progressive stages of nitrogen saturation	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Seasonal behaviour of NO3- in surface water is often used as an indicator on a catchment's ability to retain N from atmospheric deposition. In this paper, we classify 12 pristine sites (five streams and seven lakes) in southernmost Norway according to the N saturation stage concept. All examined sites were acid-sensitive and had annual mean NO3- concentrations in the range 6-36 mueq L-1. At lake sites with relatively long water residence times, hydrology will have a damping effect on the seasonal NO3- oscillations in the outlet streams. Under given runoff conditions (1.0-2.2 m yr(-1)), the seasonal NO3- pattern was clearly affected when lake: catchment area ratios exceeded 0.15 and the total residence time of lakes in the catchments exceeded 0.3 yr. In such cases, annual mean NO3- concentration rather than seasonal variations may be the better indicator of N saturation. To account for this we propose a set of supplementary criteria for such lake systems, defining limit values for annual mean NO3- concentrations within each stage class. Before being applied on a broader scale, however, we recommend an examination of additional lake-dominated catchments representing a larger gradient in ecosystem types, N deposition levels and hydrologic regimes. When applying the supplementary criteria on the Norwegian sites, two were classified as stage 0 (no saturation), five as stage 1 (early stage of saturation) and five as stage 2 (saturated - moderate N loss). No sites were showing symptoms of stage 3, which characterises watersheds that are net sources of N, rather than sinks. The results indicate a great variability in N retention capacity in the study region, despite the fact that many of the catchments experience relatively uniform N deposition amounts and climatic conditions. This suggests that much of this variability must be due to specific catchment characteristics as e.g. soil type, soil depth, and vegetation cover.

Deforestation and increasingly intensive agriculture have contributed to an increase in the mobilization of allochthonous organic material to the lake. Dissolved and particulate organic carbon transport by rivers as well as wet and dry atmospheric deposition were measured and used to construct an organic carbon budget for the lake. Although the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate carbon (PC) in Lake Malawi are among the lowest measured in any large lake and approach oceanic concentrations, significant seasonal changes over the annual cycle were found. The lake had a mean mass of 62.6 X 10(10) moles of organic carbon and within the annual cycle of DOC the mass fluctuated by 35.5 x 10(10) moles of organic carbon from September 1997 (47.1 x 10(10) moles of organic carbon) to May 1998 (82.6 x 10(10) moles of organic carbon). The annual allochthonous organic carbon input to the whole lake from all sources was approximately 8 x 10(10) moles with 36% from atmospheric sources. Previous studies have estimated a mean annual phytoplankton production of 98.9 x 10(10) moles of carbon for the whole lake. Liberation of 20 to 40% of the algal production as DOC will account for the change in the mass of organic carbon. In this large tropical system, allochthonous particulate carbon may be an increasingly significant source of energy and nutrients to the food web. Due to the importance of primary production, land use changes that increase nutrient export the lake will also alter the organic carbon stores.																			0380-1330						2003	29			2			107	120		10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70542-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70542-5													WOS:000221126800009

The specific interest of the study was to test if it is possible to detect nutrient 'physiological' or growth (rate) limitation of bacterioplankton and competition for nutrients (N and P) with phytoplankton in generally nutrient rich lake. Thymidine and leucine incorporation; leucine aminopeptidase, beta-D-glucosidase and alkaline phosphatase activity, total count of bacteria, chlorophyll a concentration and primary production as well as the concentrations of different chemical forms of N and P were followed during 4-5 days of the experiment. To address the question of the interactions between nutrients, bacterio- and phytoplankton, experimental and seasonal data sets were included in the analyses. Phosphorus (P) had a positive effect oil bacterioplankton in enclosure experiments in June 1997 no effects of nutrients were found in September 1996, while in May 1996, P affected mainly the phytoplankton. On the seasonal scale, the development of bacterioplankton was connected to primary production, total phosphorus and temperature. In enrichment experiments, bacterioplankton was mainly related with primary productivity but the possible importance of bacterial grazers could be presumed. Thus, no evidence was found for nutrient growth limitation and/or competition for N and/or P, rather bacterioplankton depended on organic food supply originating from phytoplankton.					; Kisand, Veljo/H-2466-2012; Tuvikene, Lea/H-8799-2016; Noges, Tiina/AAL-5373-2020	Tuvikene, Lea/0000-0001-6041-5900; Kisand, Veljo/0000-0002-5535-1639; 													0018-8158					AUG 1	2001	457						187	197		10.1023/A:1012291820177	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1012291820177													WOS:000173248300020

An. darlingi was present during both the dry and wet seasons. Larvae were encountered most frequently in patches of floating debris along river margins. The floating mats were often formed by bamboo hanging over the banks and dense submersed bamboo roots. Larvae were found less frequently in lake margins, small lagoons, and ground pools with submersed roots and patches of floating leaves or vegetation. In addition to their association with floating debris, larvae of An. darlingi were associated positively with shade and submersed plants in riverine environments. Samples from river habitats showed the larvae of Anopheles albimanus Wiedemann to be strongly associated with sun-exposed sites containing green or blue-green algae. Unlike An. darlingi, An. albimanus was an ubiquitous mosquito, the immatures of which occurred in a wide variety of riverine and nonriverine aquatic habitats. Based on published reports and our experience, the association of An. darling with river systems was verified, and its distribution in Central America and Mexico was mapped.

The seasonal development of crustacean zooplankton, heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) and bacteria was examined in Grosser Binnensee, a shallow, eutrophic lake in northern Germany. The grazing impact of Daphnia on bacteria and nanoflagellates was estimated from field data on population abundances and from clearance rates obtained in laboratory experiments. 2. The seasonal succession of zooplankton showed distinct peaks of Daphnia magna, cyclopopid copepods, Bosmina longirostris and Daphnia galeata and D. hyalina. The population dynamics of Daphnia had the strongest impact on all sestonic components. Daphnia maxima coincided with clearwater phases, and were negatively correlated with particulate organic carbon (POC), HNF and phytoplankton. Bacterial abundance was only slightly affected although daphnids were at times more important as bacterial consumers than HNF, as estimated from measured bacterial clearance rates. Other crustaceans (copepods, Bosmina) were probably of minor importance as grazers of bacteria and nanoplankton. 3. HNF abundance varied from 550 ml(-1) to more than 30000 ml(-1). HNF appeared to be suppressed by daphnids and reached highest densities when copepods dominated the metazooplankton. The variation in HNF abundance was not reflected in the concentration of heterotrophic bacteria, which fluctuated rather irregularly between 5 and 20 x 10(6) ml(-1).

The pelagic catch consists of the commercial categories 'small' (< 20 cm) (Stolothrissa tanganicae, Limnothrissa miodon and juvenile Lates stappersii), 'medium' (20-40 em) (L. stappersii) and 'large' (> 40 cm) (three Lates spp.) sized fish. Thirty-seven years (1956-1992) of monthly catch rates by the industrial purse-seine fishery were evaluated for the capacity of fisheries management authorities to detect possible long-term trends given large variability around such a trend due to inter-annual variability, seasonality and persistence. Variability in (10)log-transformed total catch rates (kg/vessel/month) was high (s = 0.22), but considerably lower than the variability for the commercial categories 'small' (s = 0.32), 'medium' (s = 0.59) and 'large' (s = 0.69). Long-term downward trends in catch rates were significant for catch rates as total catch (1.6% per year, r(2) = 0.21) and for the categories 'small' (1.4% per year, r(2) = 0.08) and 'large' (2.7% per year, r(2) = 0.21). Seasonality, confounding the perception of long-term trends in monthly catch rates, although with temporal predictability, explained between 3 and 10% of the total variance in monthly catch rates. Significant short-term persistence in the residuals of series, adjusted for between. year and seasonal differences, and as described by ARMA models, must be due to fleet-stock interactions. Further obscuring trends, this persistence explained 5, 11, 13 and 3% of the variance in total catch rates and of the commercial categories 'small' and 'medium' and 'large'. Basic uncertainty, as variance not explained by trend or seasonality, comprises the largest part of the variance in catch rates ('total' (75%), 'small' (83%) and 'medium' (89%)). Trend-to-noise ratios (b/s) were calculated with the slope (b) in (10)log-transformed monthly catch rates and the standard deviation in the residuals around the regression line (s). These ratios were high, necessitating long series of data to detect significant long-term trends. Faced with such large uncertainties and compounding effects of the various types of variance around long-term trends, the Burundi management authorities of the Lake Tanganyika fisheries have few possibilities to evaluate the effectiveness of, for instance, controlling fishing effort as a direct and basic management measure.

The nutrient concentrations in the lake were observed to increase with inputs of domestic wastewaters in to the lake in the last years. Chlorophyta and Cyanobacteria in the phytoplankton community in the lake were identified to be dominant together. Merismopedia minima, Microcystis aeruginosa, Sphaerocystis schroeteri and Dictiyosphaerium pulchellum were dominant during the warm period (May - October). Cyanobacterial blooms in the lake were observed in May, which is characteristic for eutrophic lakes in northern temperate region.

C10S07	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												The naturally occurring radionuclide, Pb-210, and its decay daughter, Po-210, were measured in the Keweenaw Peninsula region of Lake Superior. Water, suspended particles, sediment trap material ( settling particles), and sediment cores and grab samples were collected along three transects that stretched from 1 to 20 km from shore. Departures from secular equilibrium (activity ratio of Po-210: Pb-210 = 1) were observed for most samples. Po-210-deficiency was observed in both suspended particles (TSP) with a ratio of 0.43 +/- 0.05 (+/-95% confidence interval (CI)) and settling particles with a ratio of 0.57 +/- 0.04; higher ratios in the settling particles resulted from an admixture of resuspended sediments. Ratios in the dissolved phase were 0.45 +/- 0.12. Approximately 83% and 85% of total Po-210 and Pb-210 in the water column was in the particulate phase. No evidence of biological uptake of Po was found. Seasonal and spatial variability in activities and ratios was small. Using steady state solutions to the mass balance equations for both isotopes, similar residence times in the water column were calculated for 210 Po and Pb-210 (55 similar to 75 days in a 150-m-deep water column). It was possible to calibrate a one-box model for the paired isotopes so that the model output closely matched rates of sediment and isotope resuspension estimated from sediment traps. However, this calibration required a fractionation of the isotopes during resuspension. The particle settling velocity was estimated to be 2.3 m d(-1), which also is in agreement with the estimate (2.4 +/- 2.2 m d(-1)) from sediment traps. These results indicate rapid fluxes of radioisotopes and sediments through the water column largely driven by resuspension of sediments in nearshore areas.

Optical reflectivity of solid and liquid methane: Application to spectroscopy of Titan's hydrocarbon lakes	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Reflectance spectroscopy of outer solar system bodies provides direct observations for interpreting their surface compositions. At Titan, the Cassini spacecraft revealed dark patches in the surface reflectance at 2 and 5 mu m, interpreted as hydrocarbon lakes forming seasonally through a methane cycle. Whereas the composition of planetary materials in the solar system has been inferred from characteristic absorption bands, identification of phase states (liquid versus solid) on dynamic planetary surfaces requires laboratory reflectance ratio measurements at relevant temperatures. Using visible and near-infrared radiation from the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS), reflectance ratios of solid (single crystal) versus liquid CH4 were measured at temperatures from 50-100 K, Although the wavelength and shape of the characteristic methane absorption bands at around 1.7 and 2.3 mu m are insensitive to temperature or phase state from 50-100 K, the broad-spectrum reflectivity R(gimel) at 0.5-2 mu m decreases dramatically upon melting by at least 25% at 87-94 K Transition from solid CH4-I to liquid states at similar to 90 K displays a reflectance ratio R-solid/R-liq 1.3-1.6 at 2 mu m. This darkening of CH4 upon melting at 87-94 K is similar at visible wavelengths, and consistent with observations of hydrocarbon lakes in the far northern and southern latitudes of Titan.

J	Brown, LR; Moyle, PB				Brown, LR; Moyle, PB			Invading species in the Eel River, California: Successes, failures, and relationships with resident species	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												We examined invasions of non-native fishes into the Eel River, California. At least 16 species of fish have been introduced into the drainage which originally supported 12-14 fish species. Our study was prompted by the unauthorized introduction in 1979 of Sacramento squawfish, Ptychocheilus grandis, a large predatory cyprinid. From 1986 to 1990, we conducted growth and diet studies of squawfish, conducted intensive surveys of the distribution and habitat associations of both native and introduced species, and examined the nature of species-habitat and interspecies relationships. We found no evidence for increased growth or expanded feeding habits, compared to native populations, of Sacramento squawfish as they invaded the Eel River drainage. Ten of the introduced species were well established, with four species limited to a reservoir and six species established in streams. The success or failure of introductions of stream species appeared to be a function of the ability of a species to survive the fluctuating, highly seasonal, flow regime. The present mixture of native and exotic species has not formed stable fish assemblages but it seems likely that four habitat-associated assemblages will develop. The overall effect of the successful species introductions has been to assemble a group of species, with some exceptions, that are native to and occur together in many California streams. The assemblages now forming are similar to those found in other California streams. The assemblage characterized by squawfish and suckers is likely to be resistant to invasion, in the absence of human caused habitat modifications.																			0378-1909	1573-5133				JUL	1997	49	3					271	291		10.1023/A:1007381027518	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1007381027518													WOS:A1997XH65500001
J	Waite, DT; Hunter, FG; Wiens, BJ				Waite, DT; Hunter, FG; Wiens, BJ			Atmospheric transport of lindane (γ-hexachlorocyclohexane) from the Canadian prairies - a possible source for the Canadian Great Lakes, Arctic and Rocky mountains	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Lindane (gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane) is used as an insecticide in many countries. Concentrations of lindane have been found in air, water, soil, snow and tissue samples throughout the world, including the Great Lakes, and concerns have been raised for its potential effects on human and ecosystem health. In Canada, lindane was, until 2003, principally used as a treatment on canola seed, a crop grown mostly on the Canadian prairies. Approximately 455.3 and 510.4t of lindane were applied in May of 1997 and 1998 respectively. An estimated 12-30% of this lindane volatilised within the first 6 weeks after planting, resulting in an atmospheric loading of from 66.4 to 188.8t. Five-day forward air trajectories (movement) were calculated from three locations on the Canadian prairies, for the 6-week period following sowing of canola seed, to estimate if such movements might contribute to the seasonal increases of gamma-HCH in five Canadian target locations. These target locations were: Point Petrie on Lake Ontario (eastern Great Lakes region); the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains of southern Canada; the low Canadian Arctic between latitudes 60degrees and 70degreesN; the central Arctic between latitudes 700 and 80degreesN; and, Eureka in the high Arctic, north of latitude 80degreesN. The percent of air mass trajectories moving from the prairies to these target areas was: Point Petrie 20%; Rocky Mountains 27%; low Arctic 30%; high Arctic 6%; Eureka 0%. It is possible, then, that volatilisation of gamma-HCH from Canadian prairie canola crops contributed to the atmospheric loading in these remote regions.

J	Singh, RK; Prasad, VH; Bhatt, CM				Singh, RK; Prasad, VH; Bhatt, CM			Remote sensing and GIS approach for assessment of the water balance of a watershed	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL												The demand for water is increasing with growing population and industrialization. Water supply is considered to be one of the key factors for rapid development and urbanization. However, the overexploitation of water resources has resulted in a condition of unsustainability and environmental degradation. Hence, the information on spatial and temporal availability of water will be helpful for the optimum utilization of water resources. The water balance was used for computing seasonal and geographical patterns of water availability to facilitate better management of available water resources. The water balance study using the Thornthwaite and Mather (TM) model with the help of remote sensing and GIS is very helpful in finding out the periods of moisture deficit and moisture surplus for an entire basin. This study indicates that there is an annual deficit of 288.56 mm in the study basin and an annual surplus of 307.76 mm. The Nana Kosi watershed has a period of moisture surplus from June to August and the remaining months are a period of deficit.

The biomass of the different primary producers, and their relative contributions to the total, were measured quarterly from July 1997 to September 1998 in a tropical reservoir (Brobo, Cote-d'Ivoire). The study period was marked by an exceptional decrease in the water level as a result of a long drought with only one significant rainfall in June 1998. 2. In July 1997, at the beginning of the usual rainy season, the level of the lake was normal and the ecosystem was in a moderately clear water state dominated by littoral macrophytes, mostly Potamogeton octandrus (more than 55% of the 6.4 tons of carbon of the total primary biomass). The microphytobenthos (19%) and the phytoplankton (25%) were secondary contributors, whereas the periphyton on macrophytes (0.5%) and the epixylon (periphyton on dead flooded trees, 0.3%) were negligible. 3. As a result of the steady decline in water level due to a lack of rain, the macrophytes were progressively stranded on the shores and had disappeared by March 1998. From this time, microalgae (microphytobenthos and phytoplankton) became dominant. Their combined biomass increased slowly from 2.8 tons of carbon in July 1997 to 3.7 tons in September 1998. The microphytobenthic biomass contributed 78% to the total in March, 55% in June and 60% in September, while other contributions were mainly due to the phytoplankton. The epixylon remained negligible throughout the study ( less than or equal to 0.5% of the whole primary biomass). 4. The distribution and temporal changes in the biomass during each survey were mainly Linked to hydrology and to interactions between primary producers. 5. The effect of water level changes on free (planktonic) and fixed primary producers (periphytic microalgae and rooted macrophytes) is discussed.

Also, the contribution of macrofaunal chironomids to the decomposition of settling diatoms in benthic communities, and the relative importance of benthic meiofauna in community metabolism, were determined. The addition of diatoms resulted in an immediate response by sediment bacteria, with higher bacterial production recorded after only 2 h, and a more than tenfold increase within one day. The rapid response by sediment bacteria was accompanied by relatively high initial concentrations of dissolved organic carbon. In treatments receiving diatoms, higher bacterial production was sustained throughout the experiment. Surprisingly, neither these elevated production estimates, nor the starvation of controls affected bacterial abundance. Mean bacterial cell volume, however, was markedly affected by the addition of diatoms. Combining community respiration measurements and bacterial production estimates showed that growth efficiencies for sediment bacteria ranged from 14.6 to 34.5%. The contribution of ambient meiozoobenthos to carbon metabolism was less than 1%. Carbon budgets showed that 1.3 mg C was cooxidized along with 4.3 mg added diatom C. Sediment reworking by Chironomus larvae initially enhanced bacterial production, but the presence of Chironomus resulted in lower bacterial production estimates after 16 and 36 days. This was interpreted as a result of faster decomposition of diatoms in treatments with chironomids, which was validated by a faster decline of ATP and chlorophyll a in the sediment. Our results indicate that Chironomus larvae compete with sediment bacteria for available organic substrates.					; Johnson, Richard/P-4991-2014	Goedkoop, Willem/0000-0002-4775-5676; Johnson, Richard/0000-0001-7979-6563													0095-3628					SEP-OCT	1997	34	2					131	143		10.1007/s002489900043	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s002489900043								9230101					WOS:A1997XM77200007

PCBs and p,p'-DDE were found in the highest concentrations in eggs of both species. The residue pattern of PCB isomers and chlordane compounds suggested that double-crested cormorants have greater metabolic capacity to degrade contaminants than Caspian terns. According to the toxicity evaluation using the 2,3,7,8-TCDD equivalents (TEQs) approach, nonortho coplanar PCBs contributed much more toxicity than PCDDs and PCDFs. Total TEQ of dioxin-like compounds was likely associated with occurrence of live-deformed embryos in double-crested cormorants eggs. The toxic effects of these contaminants were also estimated in Caspian tern eggs, where elevated levels of coplanar PCBs, PCDDs and PCDFs were observed in concordance with increased rate of anomalies in eggs during a breeding season in the Great Lakes.

Here, we systematically collected samples for 9 months (from April to December 2018) in the coastal waters of Xiaoping Island in China to analyze the planktonic community structure and identify the main driving environmental factors along the nutrient gradient from the sewage outlet to the open sea. The results indicated that there existed obvious seasonal and spatial variations in the planktonic community. Procrustes test analysis showed that temperature, transparency, dissolved oxygen, nitrate ( NO3-N), phosphate (PO4-P), and silicate (SiO3-Si) significantly affected the community compositions and diversity of plankton (p < 0.05). Co-occurrence network showed that seasons and nutrients pollution had an important influence on the inter-specific interactions between phytoplankton and mesozooplankton. In different nutrient pollution gradients, diatom was the most associated with Copepods in Section 1 (9.38%), Section 2 (9.84%), and Section 3 (5.38%), respectively, and it was also associated with Planktonic larva in Section 1 (7.81%), followed by in Section 3 (4.30%) and 2 (1.64%). Dinoflagellates were associated with Chaetognatha only in Section 1 (4.69%). This study may provide new insights into the plankton dynamics and facilitate nearshore environmental management.

Koaro were 5-20 times more abundant in the large turbid lakes than in the clear ones, indicating that turbidity may reduce the extent of salmonid predation on koaro. However, the scarcity of koaro in the clear lakes was related mainly to the prevalence of brown trout (Salmo trutta) compared with rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) as the former were more piscivorous and had a stronger inverse relationship with koaro. Common bullies were more abundant at sites 20 m or more away from the shoreline, and at depths of 9-12 m irrespective of season, year and turbidity level. However, the overall abundance of bullies was reduced by 70-90% in the turbid lakes. As bullies are relatively insensitive to the direct effects of increased turbidity, indirect effects such as reductions in macrophytes from reduced water clarity or smothering of benthic habitats by settled solids are thought to influence their abundance in the lakes affected by glacial turbidity. There was no relationship between the extent of water-level fluctuation and the abundance of koaro or common bullies in the lakes, but the depth distribution of bullies was shallowest in the lake with the least water-level fluctuation and was deepest in the lake with the greatest water-level fluctuation.																			0906-6691	1600-0633				SEP	2003	12	3					216	227		10.1034/j.1600-0633.2003.00024.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1034/j.1600-0633.2003.00024.x													WOS:000184743400008

Hence, addressing the question of how representative a mid-lake sample is of in-lake conditions is important for interpreting changes in long-term monitoring programs. Our hypotheses were that; (i) the location of a sampling site within a lake will affect its representativity and (ii) a mid-lake sample could be considered representative of average surface water physico-chemistry. We focused on the surface water chemistry in 34 Swedish lakes. To obtain a wide diversity of lake types, the lakes were classified according to mean depth, water residence time, and three main ecoregions. Two sampling seasons were selected, representative of high and low biological activity and stratified and non-stratified conditions, respectively. Ten samples were collected in each lake. The mid-lake samples differed significantly from the nine remaining samples in less than 4% of the total number of two-sample t-tests performed. Samples collected close to lake inlets differed from the other samples more often than samples collected in the central parts of the lakes. We concluded that the location of a sampling site within a lake may affect the sample's representativity of lake water chemistry, and that a mid-lake surface water sample could be considered representative of surface water chemistry.

The present study found that over 99% of UVB (280-315 nm) radiation was attenuated in the top 10-20 cm of ponds sampled on the edge of the Canadian Shield near Peterborough, Ontario. While the principal attenuating substance was, as in lakes, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), neither DOC nor DOC fluorescence were useful predictors of the attenuation coefficients other than the observation that all values of DOC were high and all attenuation coefficients were also high. The lack of a reliable relationship between DOC and attenuation resulted from differences throughout the season in the fraction of the DOC capable of absorbing radiation (chromophores) and the fraction capable of fluorescing (fluorophores). Attenuation was higher than predicted from DOC during springtime when amphibians lay their eggs. Absorbance coefficients measured using a spectrophotometer proved to be reliable predictors of both UVB and UVA attenuation coefficients measured in the ponds with a spectro-radiometer, While DOC provides an effective sun screen against the direct damage of UV radiation, the high attenuation means that the photochemical activity spread over at least 15 m in the ocean is confined to only a few centimeters in ponds.																			0031-8655					DEC	1999	70	6					893	901		10.1111/j.1751-1097.1999.tb08299.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1751-1097.1999.tb08299.x													WOS:000084300300010

Field studies were seasonally carried out in 3 stations between June 2014 and July 2015. In the sampling studies carried out in Batlama Stream, contamination factor (CF), enrichment factor (EF), potential ecological risk factor (Er-i), lowest effect level (LEL), geoaccumulation index (I-geo) contamination indicators were used in order to evaluate sediment contamination. In Batlama Stream, average heavy metal level of three stations was detected in mg/dry kg in the sediment as Cr 7.08, Mn 63.62, Fe 858.04, Co 5.47, Ni 4.99, Cu 20.61, Zn 49.60, Cd 0.09, and Pb 20.68. Elements which the sediment has most are Fe, Mn, and Zn. According to EF, Pb was detected as an enriching element. Eri Pb is in the low risk group. In LEL value, the highest Pb average was found as 31. According to I-geo values, Pb is a moderate contaminant. This metal has anthropogenic sources and it is caused by domestic, agricultural, and waste waters. In the elements analysed in Batlama Stream sediment (apart from Pb), it is indicated that it is generally a clean stream and considered reference stream.					; Aydın, Handan/ABF-9679-2021; TEPE, Yalçın/B-6587-2015; USTAOGLU, FIKRET/AAP-4558-2020; ustaoğlu, fikret/AAP-4558-2020	Aydin, Handan/0000-0002-1321-2120; TEPE, Yalcin/0000-0002-8415-3754; USTAOGLU, FIKRET/0000-0002-8195-8557; 													1304-7205	1304-7191				MAR	2021	39	1					13	23																WOS:000670431400002
J	Cutrofello, M; Durant, JL				Cutrofello, Michele; Durant, John L.			Fate of high loads of ammonia in a pond and wetland downstream from a hazardous waste disposal site	CHEMOSPHERE												Halls Brook (eastern Massachusetts, USA) is a significant source of total dissolved ammonia (sum of NH3 and NH4+; (NH3)(T)) to the Aberjona River, a water body listed for NH3 impairment on the Clean Water Act 303(d) list. We hypothesized (1) that (NH3)(T) in Halls Brook derived from a hazardous waste site via groundwater discharging to a two-basin pond that feeds the brook; and (2) that transport of (NH3)(T) to the Aberjona River was controlled by lacustrine and wetland processes. To test these hypotheses we measured (NH3)(T) levels in the brook, the pond, and a wetlands directly downstream of the pond during both dry and wet weather over a ten month period. In addition, we analyzed sediment cores and nitrogen isotopes, and performed mass balance calculations. Groundwater discharge from beneath the hazardous waste site was the major source of (NH3)(T) (20-67 kg d(-1)) and salinity to the north basin of the pond. The salty bottom waters of the north basin were anoxic on all sampling dates, and exhibited relatively stable (NH3)T concentrations between 200 and 600 mg N 1(-1). These levels were > 100-times higher than typical background levels, and 8-24-times above the acute effects level for (NH3)(T) toxicity. Bottom waters from the north basin continuously spill over into the south basin contributing similar to 50% of the (NH3)(T) load entering this basin. The remainder comes from Halls Brook, which receives (NH3)(T) loadings from as yet unknown sources upstream. During storm events up to 50% of the mass of (NH3)(T) was flushed from the south basin and into the wetlands. The wetlands acted as a (NH3)T sink in dry weather in the growing season and a discharge-dependent (NH3)T source to the Aberjona River during rainstorms. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Mingram, J				Mingram, J			Laminated Eocene maar-lake sediments from Eckfeld (Eifel region, Germany) and their short-term periodicities	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY					1st Limno-Geological Congress on Research and Methods in Methods in Ancient and Modern Lacustrine Basins	AUG 21-25, 1995	COPENHAGEN, DENMARK					The Eocene age Eckfeld/Eifel maar lake is interesting both because of the excellently preserved fossil remains and also for the laminated sediment sequence deposited under subtropical conditions. The latitude, however, has a higher seasonal insolation difference than comparable recent environments due to the northward shift of climatic zones during the Eocene. The overall aim of this investigation was to compare sediment types and lake development of a Tertiary (subtropical) maar lake with recent maar lakes, to discuss the origin of laminations, and search for their possible periodicities. The main sediment types, which were exposed during recent paleontological excavations, are laminated oilshales, partly laminated bituminous siltstones, and graded beds (mostly turbidites), which sometimes include laminated clay tops. Some deeper parts of the profile drilled in 1980, are dominated by diatomaceous laminites. The amount of organic carbon (around 8.5%) is comparable with recent lakes with low sedimentation rates. The high C/N ratios (25-30) of the Eckfeld sediments, as well as the fact that the highest C-org values are found in the graded beds, shows the importance of terrestrial plant debris for these lake sediments. Lamination of the oil shales was caused by the complex interrelationship of elastic supply (mineral and plant detritus), autochthonous organic deposition (mainly green algae), and early diagenetic siderite formation. The darker sublaminae represent the coarser elastic (organic and inorganic) input together with the autochthonous supply from the lake (green algae), whereas the lighter sublaminae are composed of settled fine-grained, mostly siliciclastic detritus derived from the probable yearly turnover of the density stratification of the lake. The thickness of the fine siliciclastic and organo-clastic layers, the morphology and palaeogeographical situation of the maar lake, and the occurrence of algal layers, strongly suggest that the laminated sediments are varves (although there is no definitive proof of this). Thickness variations from ca. 700 oil shale laminae were measured and computed. Time series analysis yielded at least one certain period of 5.5 yr, accepting that the laminae are indeed varves. The duration of the laminated lake sequence from Eckfeld maar, as deduced from sedimentation rates of the different sediment types is ca. 82,000 yr and, thus, within the typical life time of other small maar lakes.

J	Plissner, JH; Haig, SM; Oring, LW				Plissner, JH; Haig, SM; Oring, LW			Postbreeding movements of American Avocets and implications for wetland connectivity in the western Great Basin	AUK												Wetlands in the western Great Basin of the United States are patchily distributed and undergo extensive seasonal and annual variation in water levels. The American Avocet (Recurvirostra americana) is one of many shorebird species that use these wetlands as breeding and migratory stopover sites and must adjust to variable conditions. WE used radio telemetry to determine postbreeding, premigratory movement patterns of avocets throughout the region In 1996 and 1997, 185 breeding adults were captured and fitted with radio transmitters at five breeding areas in Oregon, California, and Nevada. Regular aerial and ground surveys were conducted at the five main study areas from June through September, or until all avocets had left a site. Other wetlands in the western Great Basin also were surveyed by aircraft for the presence of radio-marked birds. Fifty-six percent of radio-marked avocets were still detected in the region at least eight weeks after capture. Each of these individuals was detected at an average of 2.1 lakes (range 0 to 6), with 74% found at more than one lake system. Forty radio-marked individuals moved at least 200 km between wetlands prior to migration, most of which dispersed northward. Male and female patterns did not differ significantly. Overall, movements may be associated with a prebasic molt, exploitation of a superabundant food source in northern lakes, and reconnaissance for future breeding efforts or staging sites. These results also demonstrate wide-ranging patterns of dispersal in this species and suggest a need for the consideration of large-scale habitat connectivity issues in establishing conservation strategies for shorebirds in the western Great Basin.																				1938-4254				APR	2000	117	2					290	298		10.1642/0004-8038(2000)117[0290:PMOAAA]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1642/0004-8038(2000)117[0290:PMOAAA]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000086623700002

Phosphorus loading rates in lakes with development and stocked fish in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, California, USA	ECOSPHERE												In high-elevation lakes of the Sierra Nevada Mountains of central California, USA, increases in P concentration suggest accelerated nutrient loading in these delicate aquatic ecosystems. Some of these lakes show signs of eutrophication due to increased P loading. Presently, fish stocking practices include introductions of non-native as well as native fish, and sometimes in very large quantities. Stocked fish are fed diets that are often high in P and in turn excrete high P waste into lakes and/or die and decompose, potentially adding additional P to the system. The goal of this research was to determine the potential P contributions from residential shoreline developments and stocked fish. A seasonal, steady state P loading rate model was created to quantify P loading into nine lakes in the eastern Sierra Nevada. Lakes with no fish, stocked lakes, and lakes that have shoreline developments and stocked fish were compared using measured P concentrations. The greatest difference in P-loading rates was between stocked and unstocked lakes, which yielded an average of 6.29 x 10(-3) (+/- 6.39 x 10(-3)) mg P.L-1.yr(-1) and 6.87 (+/- 5.41) mg P.L-1.yr(-1), respectively. Stocked lakes with shoreline development did not vary significantly from lakes with stocked fish and no shoreline development. The P-loading rate showed a correlation with the annual frequency of stocking events with an R-2 value of 0.73.																			2150-8925					NOV	2016	7	11							e01554	10.1002/ecs2.1554	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.1554													WOS:000387217700014

On the coast of Oaxaca, coexist four species: red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle), white mangrove (Laguncularia racemosa) button mangrove (Conocarpus erectus) and black mangrove (Aviccenia germinans). In the Laguna "Salina" Tonameca, grows and develops the white, button, and black mangroves, whose spatial distribution decreases by deforestation, land use change, and increased saline substrate. Salinity of soil and waters, its concentration, and tipogenesis associated with the growth of mangrove trees were determined. Three saline gradients were identified in rainy season (gradient I: 2.18 dS m(-1); gradient II: 9.95 dS m(-1) and gradient III: 36.14 dS m(-1)); while in drought season four gradients were detected (gradient I: 1.15 dS m(-1); II: 17.83 dS m(-1); III: 39.06 dS m(-1) and IV: 57.75 dS m(-1)). The interannual saline variation is due to climatics, hydrologycal, and geomorpholigical conditions of the substrate. The lake salinity is hydrochloric, predominantly NaCl salt, of intense osmotic effect, which largely explains the mangrove halophytism. Moisture diluting brackish water, such that low salt conditions promotes growth and development of mangrove, but at concentrations > 35 g L-1 limits their growth. In drought, hypersaline (> 70 g L-1) prevents the establishment and repopulation of this species.																			0049-6979	1573-2932				NOV	2016	227	11							426	10.1007/s11270-016-3133-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-016-3133-3													WOS:000388218600031

Profiles of the AOB communities were generated using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) to assess the expression of 16S rRNA genes followed by DNA sequence analysis. The dominant AOB groups were affiliated with Nitrosomonas and Nitrosospira spp. The effects of environmental characteristics on the AOB community distribution were analyzed by the ordination technique of redundancy analysis. The environmental characteristics significantly influencing the AOB community structure were different in the four seasons. The suspended solids (SS), ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) and nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N) differed in May, the pH, NH4+-N, NO3--N and total nitrogen (TN) differed in August, and the NH4+-N, DO and TN differed in December. None of the assessed environmental variables displayed heterogeneity in October. This study suggested that seasonal variation and nutrient differences might be responsible for the differences in the key environmental characteristics used to determine the distribution of the AOB communities in all seasons.

This paper reviews and analyzes observations and data collected since 1995 when a full-scale biopond (BP) system was constructed for the purpose of purifying domestic wastewater from the village of Charvak Hydro Power Station. The Charvak BP system was designed with a single facultative pond (FP) that feeds into two consecutive vegetated pond (VP) cells. Each of these cells is then laterally divided into even increments by submerged planted dams, the surface area of which comprises 31% of the entire cell's surface. This system has proven itself proficient in the reduction of contaminants vis-a-vis natural processes, achieving an average elimination of 76% chemical oxygen demand (COD), 93% 5-day biological oxygen demand (BOD5), 80% total suspended solids (TSS), and 89% ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N). Helminthes eggs removed via sedimentation were not detected in the final effluent. Additionally, seasonal characteristics are presented. The advantages of this system include a high efficiency in organic and NH4-N removal with less prohibitive land area requirements relative to conventional wetland systems. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

J	Ralph, S; Petras, M				Ralph, S; Petras, M			Genotoxicity monitoring of small bodies of water using two species of tadpoles and the alkaline single cell gel (comet) assay	ENVIRONMENTAL AND MOLECULAR MUTAGENESIS												To monitor genotoxicity in small bodies of water (e.g., creeks, ponds, and drainage ditches) we examined tadpole erythrocytes of two species: Rana clamitans and Rana pipiens, using the alkaline single cell gel DNA electrophoresis (SCG) or ''comet'' assay. This approach involves detection, under alkaline conditions, of cell DNA fragments which on electrophoresis migrate from the nuclear core, resulting in a ''comet with tail'' formation. Fifty-six samples, a total of 606 tadpoles, from 18 sites in southern Ontario, collected between 1993 and 1995, were examined. Samples of R. clamitans tadpoles collected in 1994 and 1995, from regions with heavy agricultural activity, gave significantly higher (P < 0.001) DNA length to width ratios than samples of R. clamitans tadpoles collected from sites in the Bruce Peninsula and near the French River, which have little or no agriculture. Samples of R. pipiens tadpoles collected in 1994 from sites on the outskirts of Windsor, Ontario, sites which receive genotoxic inputs from nearby industries, gave significantly higher (P < 0.001) DNA ratios than samples from agricultural areas and the Bruce Peninsula. R. clamitans tadpoles showed significant annual variation in DNA damage which was greater in samples of tadpoles collected from agricultural areas than from the Bruce Peninsula. The higher levels of DNA damage in tadpoles collected from agricultural areas may be due to the pesticides used, and the increased variation in DNA damage in the same areas is likely due to the impact of crop rotation, including leaving fields follow, the timing of rainfall, and/or the application of pesticides. R. clamitans tadpoles, especially those collected from agricultural areas, also showed significant seasonal variation in DNA damage. There was no significant (P > 0.05) seasonal or annual variation in the levels of DNA damage in R. pipiens tadpoles collected from the Tallgrass Prairie. This study indicates that both species ore suitable for use in the alkaline SCG assay and as in situ sentinel organisms For environmental biomonitoring.

Moreover, both the components of weather and climate are influenced by the annual seasonality. All these factors have changed during the last millennia. and periods of significant moisture have alternated with ones of low moisture. Evidence of these oscillations results from geostratigraphical subdivision of sequences of freshwater lime deposits and from lake level changes of inland lakes. but also from many archaeological observations concerning settlement distribution. All these observations reflect oscillations that can be correlated through archaeological and other dating. Alternation of drier and moister periods in the course of the Central European Holocene can be recognized. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd and INQUA.

Projected climate change may have a profound impact on this highly climate sensitive activity, which owes its existence to the moderating influence of the Great Lakes. Downscaled daily maximum and minimum temperature series provided by the U.S. National Assessment were utilized to evaluate 1) possible changes in the frequency and timing of several agronomically-relevant temperature threshold events and 2) potential interactions between crop phenology and a commercially-important insect pest (Cydia pornonella (L.)). The analyses are for the two future decades of 2025 to 2034 and 2090 to 2099. The assessments for 2025 to 2034 suggest that fruit-growing areas in the Great Lakes region will experience a moderate increase in growing season length and seasonal heat accumulation and a decrease in the frequency of freezing temperatures. In addition, important growth stages will occur earlier in the calendar year than at present. Very large changes in the temperature threshold parameters are projected for 2090 to 2099. However, it is unclear for both assessment decades whether fruit production will be more or less susceptible to damage from cold temperatures after critical growth stages are reached. Projected warming may also result in increases in the number of generations per season of a primary insect pest and the number of necessary pesticide applications.																			0380-1330						2002	28	4					608	625		10.1016/S0380-1330(02)70609-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(02)70609-6													WOS:000180411100010
J	Swales, S; Storey, AW; Roderick, ID; Figa, BS				Swales, S; Storey, AW; Roderick, ID; Figa, BS			Fishes of floodplain habitats of the Fly River system, Papua New Guinea, and changes associated with El Nino droughts and algal blooms	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Biological monitoring of the Fly River system in Papua New Guinea has shown that floodplain habitats (oxbow lakes, blocked valley lakes and seasonally inundated grassed floodplain) support diverse and abundant populations of freshwater fishes. Since monitoring first commenced in the early 1980's, a total of 66 fish species representing 33 families has been sampled, with gillnets and rotenone, from a range of sites located on the floodplains of the Fly and Strickland rivers. The fish fauna was dominated by catfishes in the families Ariidae (11 species) and Plotosidae (7 species), with aquatic invertivores being the dominant feeding group. Herring species (Nematalosa spp.) were often very abundant in the oxbow lakes, forming 66% of the total catch in all the floodplain habitats. The fish communities in the oxbow lakes and blocked valley lakes were distinctly different, with several of the smaller fish species being more abundant in the blocked valley lakes, while the oxbow lakes supported more of the larger predatory species. Catches in the oxbow lakes were also generally higher and more diverse than the blocked valley lakes or grassed floodplain sites. Since the commencement of monitoring, catches from the floodplain sites have varied considerably, both spatially and temporally. Reduced catches seen at some sites are probably associated with natural climatic factors, particularly 'El Nino' - induced droughts and algal blooms. Introduced species and increased commercial and artisanal fishing may also be affecting stocks of native fish. Fish populations were shown to recover only slowly in lakes affected by severe drought conditions, with extensive mats of floating grasses hindering fish recolonisation. Fish stocks in a lake affected by an algal bloom recovered more quickly than stocks in lakes affected by drought.																			0378-1909					APR	1999	54	4					389	404		10.1023/A:1007474501507	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1007474501507													WOS:000081522300003

In addition, the contributions of its tributaries after leaching agricultural and urban soils need to be considered. This increases the risk of contamination of the hydrosystem, especially the sediments in trace elements. The objective of this study is to evaluate the level of trace elements contamination and their spatial and seasonal variation in the sediments of the Lake Togo-Lagoon of Aneho complex. The sediment physicochemical parameters were determined in line with French standards. The trace elements were determined using an Atomic Absorption Spectrometer coupled to a hydride and cold vapour generator. The spatial and seasonal variation was assessed using Ordinary Kriging Interpolation method. The average content of trace elements in sediments in mg/kg was as follow: Cd: 0.75, Pb: 13.26, Cr: 50.63, Ni: 36.05, Cu: 10.90, Hg: 0.04, As: 3.88, Zn: 47.38 and Mn: 766.74 in the dry season. In rainy season, the average concentration was: Cd: 0.46, Pb: 9.50, Cr: 27.43, Ni: 21.36, Cu: 9.61, Hg: 0.05, As: 5.23, Zn: 39.21 and Mn: 910.08. These concentrations showed a strong spatial variation. Significant seasonal variations were obtained for conductivity, organic matter as well as for Cd, Pb, Cr, Ni, Hg and As. The sediments were found to be weakly to moderately contaminated and enriched by trace elements with a higher contamination for Cd. The sediments may have low to moderate adverse effects on aquatic living organisms. This trace element contamination is of anthropogenic origin through the phosphorite mining and the agricultural and urban effluents. Therefore, this lagoon ecosystem warrants regular monitoring for better understanding to inform protection of the resource.

(Sarraceniaceae)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The population growth and biomass production of the pitcher-plant (Sarracenia purpurea I,.) inquiline, Habrotocha rosa Donner (Rotifera: Bdelloidea), its consumption by other pitcher-plant inqulines, and its excretion of phosphorus (PO4-P) and nitrogen (NO3-N and NH4-N), were investigated in laboratory experiments. Observed population growth and production rate of H. rosa were higher at pH 4 (2.3 rotifers d(-1)) than at pH 3 (1.3 rotifers d(-1)), 5 (1.9 rotifers d(-1)), or 6 (0.8 rotifers d(-1)). Populations of H. rosa are an abundant and reliable food source for larvae of the dipteran inqulines Wyeomyia smithii (Coq.) and Blaesoxipha fletcheri (Aldrich) that co-occur with H. rosa in S. purpurea pitchers. Abundance of H, rosa within a pitcher is negatively associated with abundance of dipteran larvae, and these larvae consume rotifers in direct proportion to rotifer density (Type I functional response). Habrotrocha rosa may also account for the majority of the plant's supply of N and P. An average population of rotifers in the field (similar to 400 per pitcher) can excrete similar to 5.2 mu g NO3-N, similar to 3.91 mu g NH4-N, and similar to 18.4 mu g PO4-P per day into a single leaf, and excretion rate is independent of water pH. Over the six-month growing season of pitcher-plants in Massachusetts, U.S.A., we estimate that rotifers could supply 8.8-43 mg of N and 18.2-88 mg of P. These values far exceed the amount of N and P previously estimated to be supplied annually to the plants through insect capture or rainfall.

U37k' temperature estimates were compared to those obtained from deltaO-18 of the planktonic foraminifer Globigerinoides sacculifer and of planktonic foraminiferal assemblages for the last glacial cycle. The alkenone method showed 1.8-degrees-C cooling at the last glacial maximum, about 1/2 to 1/3 of the decrease shown by the isotopic method (6.3-degrees-C) and foraminiferal modern analogue technique estimates for the warm season (3.8-degrees-C). Warm season foraminiferal assemblage estimates based on transfer functions are out of phase with the other estimates, showing a 1.4-degrees-C drop at the last glacial maximum with an additional 0.9-degrees-C drop in the deglaciation. Increased alkenone abundances, total organic carbon percentage and foraminiferal accumulation rates in the last glaciation indicate an increase in productivity of as much as 4 times over present day. These changes are thought to be due to increased upwelling caused by enhanced winds during the glaciation. If U37k' estimates are correct, as much as 50-70% (up to 4.5-degrees-C) of estimated deltaO-18 and modern analogue temperature changes in the last glaciation may have been due to changes in thermocline depth, whereas transfer functions seem more strongly influenced by seasonality changes. This indicates these estimates may be influenced as strongly by other factors as they are by SST, which in the equatorial Atlantic was only reduced slightly in the last glaciation.

This paper re-examines previously published data on Oc. camptorhynchus, plus additional data collected since that time, and provides greater spatial and temporal definition of Oc. camptorhynchus numbers at seven sites across the Gippsland Lakes system of eastern Victoria. A total of 357 672 Oc. camptorhynchus was captured from 1188 trap-nights across the seven trap sites during trapping seasons from 1990 to 2001. The dominance of Oc. camptorhynchus across the seven sites averaged 75%, with significant differences in mean abundance of Oc. camptorhynchus found between all trap sites. Significant differences in monthly abundance of Oc. camptorhynchus were observed for Wellington Shire. Increase in populations of Oc. camptorhynchus was associated with increases in rainfall at all trap sites, higher minimum temperatures at two of the seven trap sites, and wind speed at one trap site. Prioritisation of mosquito control may be applied based on spatial and temporal factors according to the findings of this study.

We also assessed the relationship between lobster abundance and habitat characteristics. During July-August 2000, we quantified the impact of a two-day recreational fishing 'miniseason' in fished and nonfished areas within the KWNWR. Lobster density was highest in channels, followed by hard bottom and patch reefs. P. argus was rarely observed in sea-grass and never in mangrove prop-roots. Its density was related to density and volume of large sponges in channel habitats. Although channels represent only 0.06% of the study area, they provide abundant refuges and a likely corridor for migrating juveniles. The two-day fishing season reduced density of lobsters > 7 cm CL by an average of 80% across several habitats, including three marine protected areas closed to fishing. The observed decline was probably due to fishing, because percent change in density was related to number of recreational boats anchored at a given site. Relatively small marine protected areas (30-150 ha) may therefore be too small to protect the population structure of P. argus adequately within the KWNWR.

Dry areas, where the precipitation pattern is markedly seasonal, or is otherwise highly variable, are the most susceptible. The Canadian Prairies, together with the U.S. Great Plains, are one such area. While immediate loss of life is seldom a feature of most droughts, malnutrition and even starvation do follow severe droughts in some parts of the world. In Canada, economic losses, particularly in the agricultural sector, may reach several hundred millions of dollars in a drought year, with major socio-economic repercussions affecting the entire region. Environmental damages include soil degradation and erosion, vegetation damage, slough and lake deterioration and wildlife loss. Unlike most other natural disasters, drought onset is difficult to identify. Droughts develop slowly, and until human activity begins to be affected by an on-going reduction of precipitation, their existence is unrecognized. Development and application of specific soil moisture and drought indices based on cumulative precipitation deficits have enhanced drought monitoring programs. These in turn provide guidance on the need for mitigative measures that can be initiated early in the course of a drought. Any improvement in the timely application of these measures is, however, strongly dependent on being able to determine the drought's course, extent and likely severity at the earliest stage possible. The identification of precursor conditions for past drought has raised the possibility that the likelihood of a drought occurring in a particular year or growing season might be predictable. Teleconnections between North American precipitation patterns and ENSO events and other surface boundary conditions in the North Pacific have been detected. Forecasting seasonal temperature and perhaps precipitation anomalies appears to be potentially feasible using a suitable merging of precursor parameters and modelling methodologies. Clearly, future research must focus both on those precursors that have been identified and on a search for possible new ones. Development of better forecasting methodology is also essential. Research activity to identify and evaluate new mitigative measures should also be increased to keep pace with the prospects of drought predictability.																			0705-5900					JUN	1995	33	2					195	222		10.1080/07055900.1995.9649532	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07055900.1995.9649532													WOS:A1995RJ11500003
J	JOHNSON, BM; CARPENTER, SR				JOHNSON, BM; CARPENTER, SR			FUNCTIONAL AND NUMERICAL RESPONSES - A FRAMEWORK FOR FISH-ANGLER INTERACTIONS	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												A conceptual framework for sport fisheries in which fish-angler interactions are viewed as a dynamic predator-prey relationship was evaluated with data from the walleye fishery in Lake Mendota, Wisconsin. A detailed 7-yr creel survey data set for this fishery revealed a link between fish and angler dynamics. Angler catch rates were positively and linearly related to fish abundance over the range of data in the study. Angling effort was positively related to catch rate. Fish-angler relationships were obscured by three difficulties commonly associated with fishery data sets: seasonal responses, measurement errors in predictor variables, and time series bias. Statistical techniques removed each of these biases, but the data were still insufficient to conclusively identify an appropriate model for the interaction. Nevertheless, it is clear that assumptions of static angler response to sport fish manipulations are unwarranted and capable of seriously confounding management efforts. Interactions among anglers and the influence of alternative fisheries outside the observed system appeared to be important. A combination of longer duration studies on a broader geographic scale and manipulative management experiments is probably necessary to advance our understanding of fish-angler interactions.

Recovery of MAIS was significantly higher from waters, soils, and aerosols collected from the two acid, brown-water swamps located in the southeastern coastal plain. High MAIS numbers correlated with warmer temperature, low pH, low dissolved oxygen, high soluble zinc, high humic acid, and high fulvic acid. This research, in relation to previous findings for the geographic distribution and physiologic ecology of MAIS, supports the conclusion that waters, soils, and aerosols of the acid, brown-water swamps of the southeastern United States coastal plain represent major environmental sources likely connected with the higher incidence of human infection in this region.																			0003-0805					FEB	1992	145	2					271	275		10.1164/ajrccm/145.2_Pt_1.271	http://dx.doi.org/10.1164/ajrccm/145.2_Pt_1.271								1736730					WOS:A1992HC99800007

Magnetic concentration, mineralogy and grain size domains were compared with micromorphological studies to infer variations in the transportation of clastic minerals, oxide and redox conditions in the materials and anthropogenic activities. In general, conditions for the terminal Pleistocene (?-11,700 BP) were humid and transitional until the establishment of drier conditions at the end of the Pleistocene. For the early Holocene (11,700-8200 BP), the conditions were wetter and controlled by seasonal precipitation; in the middle Holocene (8200-4200 BP), the climate indicated drier conditions. Finally, in the late Holocene (4200-0 BP), the climate suggests more humid conditions but oscillating to dry stages accompanied by anthropogenic activities, manifested by an increase in sedimentation rates at the end of the period, charcoal oscillations and poor soil development.																			0895-9811	1873-0647				JUN	2021	108								103186	10.1016/j.jsames.2021.103186	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsames.2021.103186		FEB 2021											WOS:000663418600002
J	OomsWilms, AL				OomsWilms, AL			Are bacteria an important food source for rotifers in eutrophic lakes?	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												In situ grazing measurements using fluorescent particles of 0.5, 2.4 and 6.3 mu m diameter in eutrophic Lake Loosdrecht (The Netherlands) showed that Anuraeopsis fissa, a small rotifer, filtered the smallest, bacteria sized particles as efficiently or more efficiently than the larger particles. In contrast, three other rotifer species (Brachionus angularis, Filinia longiseta and Pompholyx sulcata) filtered the bacteria-sized particles less efficiently than the larger particles. Both Keratella cochlearis and Conochilus unicornis only ingested the bacteria-sized particles. Anuraeopsis fissa had a higher uptake of fluorescent bacteria-sized particles than K.cochlearis, both in 1 mu m filtrate of lake water and in lake water. Within both species, uptake did not differ between juveniles and adults. When cultured on three different size fractions of lake water (1, 3 and 15 mu m filtrate) in July, all rotifer species declined in numbers on the 1 and 3 mu m filtrates, while A.fissa and B.angularis increased in numbers on the 15 mu m filtrate. The high abundance of small bacteria in the lake water could not support rotifer populations. It is concluded that bacteria are not a suitable food source of high quality for A.fissa because its population does not grow even though the bacterial concentration was higher than its estimated threshold food concentration. In August, when individually cultured, the mortality was high for all species, but especially for F.longiseta. The lifespan of K.cochlearis was reduced in the 1 and 3 mu m filtrates of lake water, compared with in the 15 mu m filtrate. The lifespan of A.fissa was similar in all filtrates, but reproduction was reduced in the 1 and 3 mu m filtrates, as in Keratella. On the 15 mu m filtrate, their ages at first reproduction and growth rates did not differ. Individuals of A,fissa older than 4 days showed a higher survival in the 15 mu m filtrate than in the other two filtrates, as did K.cochlearis throughout its life. Hence, bacteria seem to be a more important food source for younger individuals of A.fissa than of K.cochlearis.																			0142-7873					AUG	1997	19	8					1125	1141		10.1093/plankt/19.8.1125	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/19.8.1125													WOS:A1997XT70200011
J	Bussières, N; Schertzer, WM				Bussières, N; Schertzer, WM			The evolution of AVHRR-derived water temperatures over lakes in the Mackenzie basin and hydrometeorological applications	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY												The temperature evolution of water bodies is determined and compared over the Mackenzie River hydrological basin. The thermal IR observations used to determine the water temperatures were extracted from NOAA's Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite data over the period from April 1999 to September 1999. The IR temperatures were calibrated and adjusted to account for the intervening atmosphere. For each day, 1-km-resolution temperature scenes were generated. From the temperature scenes, clear-sky temperature values were extracted for water bodies with areas larger than 100 km(2). The temperature cycle over water bodies can be decomposed into a small positive slope from near 0degreesC until the water temperature reaches 4degreesC, followed by a quadratic trend that can be easily fitted. The quadratic curve fit parameters give information for cataloging and comparing each water body's seasonal temperature cycle. Data stratification confirms a strong latitudinal influence on the shape of the curves. Compared to Great Slave Lake, the duration of open water for Lake Athabasca is longer and begins about 16 days earlier; for Great Bear Lake, the cycle is shorter and begins about 45 days later. Fitted maximum temperatures are 15.5degreesC for Lake Athabasca, 13.7degreesC for Great Slave Lake, and 6.8degreesC for Great Bear Lake. The AVHRR-derived seasonal temperatures should be useful in estimating total lake evaporation because lakes with longer and warmer seasonal temperature cycles should tend to evaporate over longer time periods than those with shorter and cooler temperature cycles.																			1525-755X					AUG	2003	4	4					660	672		10.1175/1525-7541(2003)004<0660:TEOAWT>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1525-7541(2003)004<0660:TEOAWT>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000184560000003

Hatchery fish stocked in the 1960s did nor live to maturity because of sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) predation and incidental commercial harvest. Suppression of sea lampreys began with larvicide treatments of Lake Ontario tributaries in 1971 and was enhanced when the tributaries of Oneida Lake and Lake Erie were treated in the 1980s. Annual stocking of hatchery fish was resumed with the 1972 year class and peaked at about 1.8 million yearlings and 0.3 million fingerlings from the 1985-1990 year classes. Survival of stocked yearlings declined over 50% in the 1980s and was negatively correlated with the abundance of lake trout > 550 mm long (r = -0.91, P < 0.01, n = 12). A slot length limit imposed by the State of New York for the 1988 fishing season reduced angler harvest. Angler harvest in Canadian waters was 3 times higher in eastern Lake Ontario than in western Lake Ontario. For the 1977-1984 year classes, mean annual survival rate of lake trout age 6 and older was 0.45 (range: 0.35-0.56). In U.S. waters during 1985-1992, the total number of lake trout harvested by anglers was about 2.4 times greater than that killed by sea lampreys. The number of unmarked lake trout < 250 mm long in trawl catches in 1978-1992 was not different from that expected due to loss of marks and failure to apply marks at the hatchery, and suggested that recruitment of naturally-produced fish was nil. However, many of the obstacles which may have impeded lake trout rehabilitation in Lake Ontario during the 1980s are slowly being removed, and there are signs of a general ecosystem recovery. Significant recruitment of naturally produced lake trout by the year 2000, one interim objective of the rehabilitation plan for the Lake, may de achieved.																			0380-1330						1995	21			1			83	107		10.1016/S0380-1330(95)71085-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(95)71085-1													WOS:A1995UL89400008

No naturally produced walleye eggs were collected in the Honeoye Lake inlet channel where adults congregated during the 2002 and 2003 spawning seasons, nor were fry collected in the lake until after 8.7 million were stocked in 2003. Radio-tagged walleye exhibited homing and site fidelity in Honeoye Lake but not to the few known areas with suitable spawning substrates (no eggs were collected at these locations).																			0270-5060					JUN	2007	22	2					297	309		10.1080/02705060.2007.9665051	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2007.9665051													WOS:000246088600015
J	McHorney, R; Neill, C				McHorney, Richard; Neill, Christopher			Alteration of water levels in a Massachusetts coastal plain pond subject to municipal ground-water withdrawals	WETLANDS												The coastal plain ponds that occur within glacial deposits in the northeastern U.S. experience annual and inter-annual water level fluctuations. Periodic inundation and drying of coastal plain pond shorelines has led to the development of pondshore vegetation communities that are unusually diverse and restricted in distribution. Because water level fluctuations are the primary abiotic control on plant community composition and dynamics, ground-water extraction for municipal supply has the potential to alter pond hydroperiod and plant community structure. We assessed the influence of ground-water pumping on pond levels at Mary Dunn Pond in the Hyannis Ponds Complex in Barnstable, Massachusetts. Short-term well pumping tests, seepage rate measurements, and measurements of surface-water and ground-water temperatures during pumping tests provided unequivocal evidence of an intimate surface-water/ground-water connection. A regression model that related pond levels to pumping and natural background variations in water levels from 1976-2003 indicated that pumping affected water levels in all seasons and that the drawdown from high intensity pumping during 1983-91 persisted for more than one year. The model also indicated that pumping truncated ecologically significant multi-year periods of high water. Pumping shifted the zone of pond-level fluctuations to lower elevations of the Mary Dunn Pond shore and into more organic-rich soils potentially diminishing plant community diversity over the long term. The current rates of pumping, instituted in 1992 after a severe drawdown, more closely approximated the natural hydrologic regime. Planning agencies and water suppliers should consider the ecological effects of ground-water withdrawals in water supply planning and during management of existing wellfields in similar hydrogeologic settings.																			0277-5212					JUN	2007	27	2					366	380		10.1672/0277-5212(2007)27[366:AOWLIA]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1672/0277-5212(2007)27[366:AOWLIA]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000247423000015
J	Eriksson, MG; Sandgren, P				Eriksson, MG; Sandgren, P			Mineral magnetic analyses of sediment cores recording recent soil erosion history in central Tanzania	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Sediment cores, covering the period from ca. 1835 to 1988 AD, were retrieved from Lake Haubi, located in a severely eroded area in the Kondoa District, central Tanzania. The results of mineral magnetic analyses undertaken on the sediment cores reflect two distinctly different depositional environments. Before ca. 1902 AD the basin formed a seasonally inundated swamp, which subsequently turned into a lake. The swamp sediment is black, uniform, and extremely clay-Rich. It contains antiferromagnetic minerals (e.g. haematite) but lacks ferrimagnetic minerals (e.g. magnetite) due to post-depositional dissolution. The lake sediment is also very clay-rich but laminated. Here ferrimagnetic minerals (magnetite) dominate the magnetic assemblage. The soil erosion history of the catchment has been reconstructed using results based on the mineral magnetic analyses and on the sedimentation rates obtained from Pb-210 datings, whereby variations in magnetic concentrations and ratios, attributed to variations in sediment influx, are assumed to reflect soil erosion within the catchment. The results from the magnetic analyses are in general agreement with the sedimentation rates. High sediment accumulation occulted around the turn of the century, and increased generally since 1935, with particularly high rates between ca. 1945 and 1950, and from ca. 1955 to the present. The reconstructed soil erosion history has been compared to both historical records of anthropogenic activity in the Kondoa District and to rainfall data. From this comparison we infer that effects on soil erosion from variations in rainfall are subordinate to those induced by man. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Otoliths were recovered from cormorant pellets collected from 1993 to 2002 at six colonies along the eastern. Lake Ontario-St. Lawrence River corridor. Otolith length fish length regressions were used to estimate the length of fish species consumed by cormorants. Only 1.5% of these otoliths had no visible erosion, 33.3% had minor erosion, and 65.2% had moderate erosion. We found that the exclusive use of uneroded otoliths severely limited the sample size available for estimating fish size and likely would cause an overestimation of fish size. Species-specific differences were evident when using erosion criteria to determine fish size and could result in bias when estimating length, especially for species such as smallmouth bass whose otoliths possess a rostrum that is readily eroded. Using a random sample (n = 100) of all intact otoliths recovered in pellets provided a conservative estimate of fish length that was smaller than that derived from uneroded or minimally eroded otoliths. Annual variation in. the size of fish consumed by cormorants was more pronounced than seasonal variation for most species. We describe and recommend a new technique that incorporates both chick regurgitant and pellet samples for estimating the size of fish consumed by cormorants.

J	Vidakovic, J; Bogut, I				Vidakovic, Jasna; Bogut, Irella			Aquatic macrophytes as a habitat for free-living nematodes	NEMATOLOGY												The composition, trophic structure and diversity of nematode assemblages associated with three aquatic macrophyte species (Polygonum amphibium, Carex sp., Ceratophyllum demersum) were surveyed. Sampled stands were present at the three sites of the north bank in the Conakut Channel (Nature Park Kopacki rit, Croatia). They were all submerged during the period of investigation, which included two vegetation seasons. Nematode abundances (expressed as a number of individuals per 100 g of macrophyte dry weight) differ between the two vegetation seasons and between the sites, but not between the macrophyte species. In total, 19 nematode species were recorded. Chromadorina viridis, C. bioculata, Brevitobrilus stefanskii, Eutobrilus notus, Prodorylaimus longicaudatus and Ethmolaimus sp. were associated with all macrophyte species. Genera Eutobrilus, Brevitobrilus and Chromadorina were present at the highest relative abundances. Species diversity (H' and Simpson's D) and evenness (Pielou's J), calculated on the nematode species level, display little or no change in relation to different macrophyte species. Ceratophyllum demersum associated nematode fauna had distinct dominance of one species (Eutobrilus notus) and consequently lower evenness, which was not statistically significant. Chewers (CH) represented the dominant trophic group of total nematode abundance for all three macrophyte species followed by epistrate feeders (EF). Detritus feeders (DF) and suction feeders (SF) were represented by low relative abundances. This paper is a contribution to ecology of aquatic nematodes associated with macrophyte species in mesoeutrophic to eutrophic slow flowing channel.																			1388-5545						2006	8		5				691	701		10.1163/156854106778877956	http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/156854106778877956													WOS:000243373800006
J	Salini, JP; Brewer, DT; Blaber, SJM				Salini, JP; Brewer, DT; Blaber, SJM			Dietary studies on the predatory fishes of the Norman River estuary, with particular reference to penaeid prawns	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												The predatory fish community and their prey in the Norman Rivere estuary, Gulf of Carpentaria Australia, are compared with the communities of other tropical inshore areas, to investigate patterns of predation in tropical inshore areas particularly in relation to penaeid prawns. Abiotic factors (turbidity, freshwater input) and diversity of habitat types affect the composition of both prey and predator communities, resulting in large differences in the communities of tropical inshore waters. The stomach contents of 2059 predatory fish from the Norman River estuary were analysed over four sampling trips in the wet and dry seasons. The stomachs of 61% (1255 fish) of 54 species contained a total of 676.2 g (dry weight) of food, while 39% (804 fish) were empty. Teleosts were the main component of the diet (by dry weight) of 13 of the 22 species analysed, followed by annelids for two species. Five species had only teleosts in their stomachs. Most predator species ate benthic or bentho-pelagic prey, while three species-Rhizoprionodon taylori, Scomberoides commersomianus and Leptobrama mulleri-ate mainly pelagic prey. Although 19 species ate some penaeids, only Polydactylus sheridani ate little else. This species, Lates calcarifer and Eleutheronema tetradactylum ate 94.5% of all the penaeid prey and 97.9% of all the commercially important penaeid prey recorded in the study. Penaeid predation indices (calculated from gillnet catch rates, proportion of penaeids in the diet and a consumption rate of 3% body weight per day) were 0.23 g of penaeid per net-metre per day for P. sheridani, 0.15 for L. calcarifer and 0.03 for E. tetradactylum. Commercially important penaeid predation indices were 0.11, 0.13 and 0.01, respectively. These values are intermediate between those previously recorded for the main penaeid predators in other inshore areas of the Gulf of Carpentaria (Embley River estuary and Groote Eylandt).

J	Duffy, KC; Baltz, DM				Duffy, KC; Baltz, DM			Comparison of fish assemblages associated with native and exotic submerged macrophytes in the Lake Pontchartrain estuary, USA	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Since the exotic Eurasian milfoil Myriophyllum spicatum (L.) was first reported in the Lake Pontchartrain estuary in 1978, it has become established as a dominant species of submerged macrophyte, but its distribution and abundance have varied considerably. We compared fish assemblages among two native macrophytes, Vallisneria americana (Michx) and Ruppia maritima (L.), the exotic M. spicatum, and unvegetated substratum to determine if milfoil influenced assemblage structure and microhabitat use by common littoral fishes. We used a modified Wegener ring to quantitatively assess fish densities. In monthly sampling from March 1991 to January 1993, we collected 3564 fishes of 29 species, but four dominant species, rainwater killifish Lucania parva (Baird), naked goby Gobiosoma bose (Lacepede), gulf pipefish Syngnathus scovelli (Evermann and Kendall), and clown goby Microgobius gulosus (Girard) accounted for over 87% of the fishes. Community diversity was highest in V. americana, intermediate in unvegetated areas, and lowest in R. maritima and M. spicatum. The patterns for evenness and richness differed from that of diversity among the four habitat types. Analyses of percent similarity and rank correlation of community structure showed no significant differences between M. spicatum and native macrophytes. The common fishes were significantly more abundant in vegetated areas than on adjacent unvegetated substratum, and total abundances were higher in M. spicatum and R. maritima than in V. americana. Only three fishes showed significant differences among macrophyte species: rainwater killifish and clown goby were more abundant in M. spicatum and R. maritima, and bay anchovy Anchoa mitchilli (Valenciennes) was more abundant in M. spicatum than in V. americana. Additionally, fish abundances were related to environmental variables in a factor analysis that resolved nine variables into four axes, characterized in order of importance as: a large-scale spatial (salinity) axis, a seasonal axis, a turbidity axis, and a plant surface area axis. The different patterns of fish species in environmental space revealed spatial and temporal differences in resource utilization. The exotic macrophyte M. spicatum may not have had a detectable influence on fish assemblages or abundances relative to the native macrophytes because high wave energy in the open system may prevent it from growing densely enough to strongly alter microhabitat characteristics.

J	Sutherland, B; Foreman, FF				Sutherland, B; Foreman, FF			Black spruce and vegetation response to chemical and mechanical site preparation on a boreal mixedwood site	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH												The growth and development of outplanted black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) and competing vegetation five growing seasons after mechanical and chemical site preparation treatments are presented. The largest stem volume increase for black spruce coupled with the lowest vegetation indices for competing trees and shrubs were recorded on the treatment consisting of chemical site preparation with liquid hexazinone applied at 3.1 kg active ingredient (a.i.)ha(1) followed by chemical tending in the second and fourth growing season with glyphosate applied at 1.78 kg a.i.ha(1). Black spruce stem volume growth was second highest and the vegetation indices for competing trees and shrubs the highest, on plots treated with hexazinone site preparation. Among mechanical treatments, black spruce stem volume was highest on plots treated with mixed-mound site preparation. No other mechanical site-preparation treatment improved the growth of black spruce over boot-screef site preparation alone. The vegetation index of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) was reduced on mixed-mound and area-mixed site preparation treatments. The vegetation index of red raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) was reduced on area-mix and area- and strip-screef treatments. By the fifth growing season, site-preparation treatment had little effect on the comparative growth of grasses and forbs. High-speed strip-mixing with 80 cm wide strips spaced at 2-m centres, on deep, fertile, silty loams of Site Region 3W-Lake Nipigon, does not appear feasible as an alternative to chemical site preparation or conventional manual and mechanical site preparation.																			0045-5067	1208-6037				OCT	2000	30	10					1561	1570		10.1139/x00-087	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x00-087													WOS:000090016700007
J	Watkins, CJ; Dux, AM				Watkins, Carson J.; Dux, Andrew M.			Assessment of Largemouth Bass Growth in Northern Idaho Lakes: Spatiotemporal Patterns and Extrinsic Associations	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												We examined patterns in the somatic growth of populations of Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides in northern Idaho lakes and modeled its variation to understand how spatiotemporal differences in climate regulate growth in lentic systems. Age was estimated from 768 Largemouth Bass from six distinct populations. Largemouth Bass growth and longevity in northern Idaho was typical to populations at similar latitudes; however, growth was substantially slower than average compared with other populations throughout North America. Mean relative growth estimates of Largemouth Bass for ages 1-8 never exceeded the 25th percentile of the North American average, and relative growth was either stable or slightly increasing as a function of age for most study populations. Annual incremental growth was more variable across years than among populations. Growth tended to be positively related to precipitation during the growing season or mean minimum annual temperature, but the importance of either covariate was dependent on lake surface area. Approximately 50% of the variation in growth of Largemouth Bass was explained by precipitation during the growing season in lakes with a surface area <= 70 ha. In the largest study lakes (i.e., >= 600 ha), over 50% of the variability in incremental growth was attributable to mean minimum annual temperature. Similarity in lake surface area resulted in the most interannual growth synchrony, whereas less synchrony was observed as a function of proximity. We hypothesize that annual climate patterns are not spatially variable enough in northern Idaho to elucidate measurable effects on growth but that local geography may be more important for regulating how climate interacts with Largemouth Bass growth on a regional basis. We interpret our results to mean that the ecology and conservation of Largemouth Bass may benefit from a more complete understanding of the climate-growth relationships on a region-by-region basis, with particular consideration for ecosystem characteristics.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				FEB	2021	41	1					86	102		10.1002/nafm.10528	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.10528		JAN 2021											WOS:000609942500001

The aim of this study was to test the existence of migration patterns for cladocerans, adult copepods and copepod development stages (copepodites and nauplii) in four sampling seasons: October 2004; January, April and July 2005. The main abiotic and biotic factors influencing the microcrustacean day and night distributions were also analyzed: water temperature, dissolved oxygen, transparency; the distribution of planktonic algae at midday and at midnight in July and the number of larvae of the dipteran predator Chaoborus present in the plankton samples. For most microcrustaceans, nighttime biomass exceeded the daylight values in the water column, indicating a strategy of predator avoidance by staying near to the bottom of the lake during the day. Normal DVM patterns (up at night and down during the day) were observed for cladocerans and adult copepods, while for copepodites and nauplii no clear patterns were depicted. Negative correlations between daytime vertical profiles of planktonic algae and microcrustacean biomass revealed that both cladocerans and copepods migrated away from phytoplankton-rich waters during the day, to escape visual predators like fish. The return in the water column during the night was influenced by invertebrate predation pressure, exerted by Chaoborus larvae.

Taken together, bacterial production (BP) and bacterial respiration (BR), i.e., bacterial carbon demand (BCD), accounted for about 65 % of gross primary production (GPP), measured biweekly and averaging 2.3 g C m(-2) day(-1) during the last decade (2001-2011). Community respiration (CR) was 2.1 g C m(-2) day(-1). The major contributors to total CR were bacterial and phytoplankton respiration (similar to 80%) while zooplankton respiration accounted for the reminder. Most (similar to 83 %) of the OC input were eventually respired, similar to 3 % lost to outflows, while similar to 15 % of the total OC input were transferred annually to the sediments. Here oxic mineralization is gradually replaced by anoxic processes as a function of the availability of suitable electron acceptors. After the depletion of oxygen in the hypolimnion, sulfate (500 mu M) becomes the dominant oxidant. Depending on the settling flux of OC sedimentary sulfate reduction (SR) rates were measured from 0.01 to 1.67 mu mol cm(-3) day(-1) in December and July, respectively. SR is the dominant anaerobic terminal decomposition process in Lake Kinneret and is responsible for the accumulation of sulfide in the hypolimnion to concentrations up to 400 mu M. Methanogenesis is restricted to those sediment layers that are depleted of sulfate (below 3-5 cm). Seasonal profiles and 13C signatures of dissolved methane in the sediment pore water of Lake Kinneret have indicated anaerobic methane oxidation in the deeper sediments (below 20 cm), with Fe(III) as electron acceptor. Lake Kinneret resembles the first aquatic ecosystem where the existence of this process could be verified. Changes in the watershed and lake environment are suggested as possible causes for the apparently significant declines in bacterial numbers, BP, and BCD that have taken place over the last decade in Lake Kinneret.

Glaciers of central Tien Shan are considered to be very sensitive indicators of climate change. The studied lake belongs to a system of relatively recently formed lakes situated near the front of the retreating glacier and is numbered amongst the potentially dangerous. The lake's water level and its dependence on the development of climatic conditions in the area were monitored in detail in 2007-2012. A substantial part of this paper is the evaluation of the inflow and outflow balance of the lake's basin. The results confirmed that the hydrological regime is glacial and exhibits its typical characteristics, such as a seasonal evolution of runoff delay or significant diurnal fluctuation of the lake's water level. During the monitored period, no major changes in annual lake level fluctuation were recorded.

Spatial and temporal distribution of foot-and-mouth disease virus in the lake zone of Tanzania	ONDERSTEPOORT JOURNAL OF VETERINARY RESEARCH												This study was conducted to determine the spatiotemporal distribution of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus (FMDV) serotypes and evaluate the awareness of livestock keepers about FMD in Tanzania. An observational prospective study involving serological analysis, FMDV antigen detection and questionnaire survey was carried out in the lake zone of Tanzania. Seroprevalence of antibodies to the nonstructural protein 3ABC of FMDV and serotype-specific antigen detection were investigated by using SVANOVIR (R) FMDV 3ABC-Ab ELISA and indirect-sandwich ELISA (sELISA), respectively, whilst a structured questionnaire was used to evaluate the awareness of livestock keepers about FMD. During the period of 2010-2011, both serum and tissue (foot-and-mouth epithelia) samples were collected from cattle suspected of FMD in 13 districts of the four regions of the lake zone. A total of 107 (80.5%) out of 133 tested serum samples were seropositive to nonstructural protein 3ABC, with at least one sample being positive from all 10 districts screened. Fifteen (53.6%) out of 28 tissue epithelial samples collected from FMD cases in eight districts during the course of this study were positive to serotype O FMDV antigen. Of these eight districts, serotype O FMDV antigens were detected from seven districts and no other serotypes were recovered from animal samples screened. Questionnaire surveys in six districts indicated that livestock keepers in the lake zone were aware of the clinical manifestations (26/29 = 90.0%) and economic impact (23/29 = 79.0%) of FMD in the region. The questionnaire data showed that FMD outbreaks often occurred after rainy seasons (22/29 = 75.9%), with the highest peaks predominantly occurring just after the long rains in May and June, and at the end of the short rains in November and December of each year. The spatial distribution of the FMD cases suggested that serotype O virus exposure was the only widespread cause of the 2010-2011 outbreaks in the lake zone.																			0030-2465	2219-0635					2014	81	2		4					724	10.4102/ojvr.v81i2.724	http://dx.doi.org/10.4102/ojvr.v81i2.724								25005020					WOS:000345393300007

The co-existence of all these species was documented in only one water body, and no amphibians were revealed in another five ponds. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed positive correlations between the composition of batrachofauna and the morphometric parameters of water bodies, hardness, and water temperature. These correlations were the strongest in the case of Rana esculenta complex and Rana temporaria. Furthermore, the composition of batrachofauna correlated inversely with certain chemical parameters of the water, such as the concentration of nitrogen and total phosphorus, and N:P ratio. Moreover, we observed the inverse correlation between the prevalence of Rana temporaria, Rana esculenta, and Lissotriton vulgaris and the concentration of chlorophyll a. In our study, the physical parameters strongly differentiating the composition and abundance of amphibians, whereas chemical parameters of water had only little influence on it.

MEASUREMENT OF GLACIER VELOCITY AT PIK LENIN, TAJIKISTAN, BY FEATURE TRACKING	ISPRS TECHNICAL COMMISSION VIII SYMPOSIUM	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				ISPRS Technical Commission VIII Symposium	DEC 09-12, 2014	Hyderabad, INDIA	ISPRS Tech Commiss, Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing, Indian Soc Remote Sensing, Indian Soc Geomat				Glaciers, especially in mountain area are sensitive indicators of climate fluctuations and also contribute to present rates of sea level rise. In Central Asia, these glaciers are the primary resource for fresh water. Understanding the seasonal behavior of these glaciers would help to make efficient use of the available water reservoir. Different methods have been employed to study glacier displacements in past. The conventional survey techniques are very cost-intensive and highly depend on accessibility to high mountain glaciers also directs us to look for new ways to study these areas. Here remote sensing comes in handy with freely available data and a good coverage with high spatial and temporal resolution. Optical satellite imagery, available free can be effectively used for research purpose. The glacier in this region fed lake Karakul (380 km(2)), the largest Lake in Tajikistan. The objective is to study the displacement tendency of the Glacier in Pik Lenin area using Landsat 7 dataset. Normalized cross correlation algorithm has been implemented via CIAS to estimate the motion of glacier surface. A number of combination of reference block and search area size were tested for 30 m resolution dataset. As a result the specifications: reference block size of 15 pixels and search area size of 10 pixels was found out as the best set of parameters and considered for further processing. The study derives a reliable set of data depicting the velocities in the glacier which after post processing shows peak velocity of 121 m/y of the glacier.

Eliciting Local Ecological Knowledge and Community Perception on Fishkill in Taal Lake through Participatory Approaches	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT					International Conference on Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation for Food and Environmental Security (ICCCIAFES)	NOV 21-22, 2012	Los Banos, PHILIPPINES	Univ Philippines Los Banos (UPLB), So Asian Reg Ctr Grad Study & Res Agr (SEARCA)				Aquaculture of tilapia (Oreochromis spp.) and bangus or milkfish (Chanos chanos) is a predominant activity in Taal Lake since 1975. Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) was conducted to collect and synthesize indigenous knowledge and perceptions regarding environmental conditions and fishkills in Taal Lake. Specifically, this study aimed to document anecdotes on land- and lake-use changes through time, commodity shifts and utilization, technological flow, and environmental phenomena. The community's perceptions on probable causes of fishkills were also elicited Finally, the people's view on the different internal and external factors linked to environmental management as well as their proposed solutions to problems were accounted and analyzed The major trends and changes in natural resource utilization, urbanization, terrestrial and aquatic livelihood activities, and occurrence of fishkill in the four municipalities in the past seven decades were illustrated using Timeline activity. Increase in human population is the major driver of changes in the natural resources of these municipalities. The local communities in the four municipalities depend on agricultural farming and fish based activities in Taal Lake for their livelihood. The various factors involved in the occurrence of fishkill in Taal Lake could be categorized into environmental (climatic and volcanic) and anthropogenic factors. Oxygen depletion, volcanic activity, lake overturn, sudden changes in water color, seasonal changes, wind, hydrothermal vents, poor water quality, improper aquaculture practices, and various forms ofpollution-generating anthropogenic activities were cited to have influenced the occurrence of fishkills. The devastation brought by fishkill events prompted the community to formulate solutions based on experiences, knowledge of aquaculture industry, and the physical conditions of the lake. The cage operators, for instance, conduct oxygenation of fish cages when low dissolved oxygen (DO) is observed and during transfer of fish cages to other areas. In addition, efforts towards efficient aquaculture practices such as continuous reduction and systematic arrangement of fish cages in the respective zones, reduced stocking density and feeding rates in fish cages, and proper disposal and management of wastes from domestic, industrial and agricultural (poultry and piggery) sources are the suggested solutions to avoid fishkill. The response of the community to reduce the impact of fishkill is anchored on local ecological knowledge, technology, governance and vigilance.					de la Cruz, Christian Paul/AGP-5222-2022; Salvacion, Arnold/D-4883-2016	de la Cruz, Christian Paul/0000-0001-5463-6635; Salvacion, Arnold/0000-0001-8868-2226													0119-1144						2014	17	2					1	16																WOS:000346756800001

Impact of water quality on phytoplankton community and biomass in Dhamara estuary east coast of India	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												Distribution of phytoplankton, productivity and chlorophyll-a concentration in relation to physico-chemical parameters viz, water temperature, pH, total suspended solid, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, salinity and nutrients (NO2-N, NO3-N, PO4-P and SiO4-Si) were studied for pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon during the year 2005. The major groups of phytoplankton species were diatoms followed by dinoflagellates and other algae. A total of 43 species of phytoplankton comprising 32 diatoms, 6 dinoflagellates and 5 other algae were recorded during the entire study period. The species Nitzschia, Chaetoceros and Coscinodiscus were identified as dominant diatoms group. Higher values of phytoplankton (28612 nos l(-1)) with high rate of photosynthesis were observed during post-monsoon season, which was responsible for increasing DO (8.72 mg l(-1)) and pH(8.24) of the water column. R-mode factor analysis revealed that there were two factors or PCs that explained 93.0%, 95.2% and 94.4% of the total variance for pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon respectively. Generally, the trend distribution of phytoplankton closely followed the distribution of salinity, pH and DO of estuarine water.																			0254-8704					JAN	2014	35	1					229	235																WOS:000331416000013

A total of twelve (12) water samples were collected for analyses from selected sampling sites. These samples were analyzed for physico-chemical properties, heavy metals concentrations, and organic pollutants concentrations. The analyzed results indicated that average temperature varied from 28.1 degrees C to 34.1 degrees C, pH 6.2 to 9.0, EC 55 to 400 mu s/cm, turbidity 5.6 to 74.2 NTU, DO 3.21 to 9.56 mg/l, TDS 36.8 to 268 mg/l, F- 0.017 to 0.182 mg/l, Cl- 0.483 to 3.339 mg/l, Br- 0 to 0.392 mg/l, SO42- 0.051 to 15.307 mg/l, Mg 0.833 to 1.466 mg/l, Na 0.669 to 3.668 mg/l, and Ca 2.85 to 26.77 mg/l. Heavy metals concentrations (mg/l) were: Zn 0.04 to 0.057, Pb 0.019 to 0.075, Cd not detected, Ni 0.013 to 0.105, As not detected to 0.004, and Cu not detected while COD 4 to 51 mg/l. Analyses revealed that all the water samples were turbid and containing slightly high concentration of Pb. Generally, they had common water quality problem. Further work should carry out more tests on other water quality parameters particularly on heavy metals, chemical and biological pollutants at different seasons.

Inundation and groundwater dynamics for quantification of evaporative water loss in tropical wetlands	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Characterizing hydrological processes within tropical wetlands is challenging due to their remoteness, complexity and heterogeneity. In particular, estimates of evaporative water loss are inherently uncertain. In view of the large influence on the local and regional climate, the quantification of evaporation is essential for the determination of the water balance of permanent and intermittent water bodies. Data for tropical wetlands are scarce where their remoteness impedes direct evaporation measurements. Seasonal inundation dynamics affect evaporation processes in tropical wetlands, which can be analysed in two stages: the first stage during the wet season and the second stage during the dry season. As yet no adequate method exists for determining second-stage evaporation in a data-scarce environment that additionally allows for a transfer of simulated actual evaporation (AET) to other locations. Our study aimed at developing a process-based model to simulate first- and second-stage evaporation in tropical wetlands. We selected a set of empirical potential evaporation (PET) models of varying complexity, each based on different assumptions and available data sets, and evaluated the models with pan evaporation observations in the Pantanal of South America, one of the largest tropical wetlands in the world. We used high-resolution measurements of surface and groundwater levels at different locations to determine the water available for evaporation. AET was derived by constraining simulated PET based on available water. The model of best fit was applied to different types of water bodies with varying hydroperiods to capture first- and second-stage evaporation across a range of wetland types. With our new model we could quantify evaporative water loss in the dry and the wet season for different locations in the Pantanal. This new spatially explicit approach represents an improvement in our understanding of the role of evaporation in the water balance of the Pantanal. We recommend the application of this model in other remote tropical wetlands, since only a minimum of input data is necessary.

S	Sinha, R		Kale, VS		Sinha, Rajiv			The Sambhar Lake: The Largest Saline Lake in Northwestern India	LANDSCAPES AND LANDFORMS OF INDIA	World Geomorphological Landscapes											The Sambhar Lake is a playa (seasonal lake with a flat bottom) located at the eastern fringe of the Thar Desert in Rajasthan. For more than four decades, this lake has attracted enormous attention due to its hypersalinity. The hypotheses to explain the geological evolution of the Sambhar have ranged from marine connection, river blockage by dunes and tectonics. This chapter presents the current understanding of the evolution of the Sambhar based on modern tools such as remote sensing and GIS and geochemical data such as evaporite mineralogy, elemental chemistry and stable isotopes. Available data suggest that the Sambhar Lake basin evolved as a pull-apart (extensional) basin and was further extended by geomorphic processes such as deflation. The hypersalinity of the Sambhar brine is related to progressive evaporation of fresh water in a semi-arid climate and the necessary chemical inputs for a hypersaline brine are derived from the catchment rocks. However, the salinity of the Sambhar Lake water has changed over time in response to variations in hydrological flux induced by climate change. Evaporite mineralogy and chemical composition of Sambhar Lake sediments have been used for reconstructing palaeoclimatic fluctuations in Thar region for the last 30,000 years.

Recent reanalyses of this assemblage support the original interpretation of a taphonomically complex, fluvially modified site. Despite this taphonmic complexity, the role of humans in the butchering and possible accumulation of some of the bison fauna is also supported, although not as the only mechanism of accumulation. The bison assemblage is slightly biased toward males, and seasonality estimates are spread throughout the year.

The composition and origin of the clay in three segments of the lower part of the Solent Group have been investigated by X-ray diffraction, microprobe analysis, inductively coupled plasma-mas spectrometry, K/Ar dating, high resolution scanning electron microscopy, analytical transmission electron microscopy and wet chemistry. The detrital clay mineral suite is dominated by illite and smectite with minor kaolinite and chlorite. Seasonal wetting and drying in gley soils has resulted in replacement of smectite by Fe-rich, or illite-rich illite-smectite. Illite has also formed with gyypsum and calcite in ephemeral hypersaline alkaline lakes that periodically dried out. This illite may have precipitated directly from solution. X-ray diffraction data and probe analyses indicate that the neoformed illite is Fe-rich. The K and Fe for the illitization are thought to be derived from weathered glauconite reworked from the underlying Bracklesham Group and Barton Beds.																			0009-8558					SEP	2001	36	3					447	464		10.1180/000985501750539526	http://dx.doi.org/10.1180/000985501750539526													WOS:000171363400014

The population dynamics of kapenta fluctuate seasonally in synchrony with the physical processes that shape the trophic status of the lake. Diel feeding periodicity and mean stomach fullness of L. miodon were used to estimate the daily ration and food consumption rates of the population. The daily ration (R (d)) was estimated from mean stomach contents and evacuation rates calculated using the modified Bajkov (Trans Am Fish Soc 65:288-289, 1935) formula. Data on stomach contents present at different time intervals over continuous feeding cycles under experimental conditions were analysed. The results show a daily ration of 8.8-9.9% of fresh body weight day(-1). The estimated whole population food consumption rate suggests very efficient grazing. The present data enable estimations of the potential standing biomass of L. miodon sustained by the lake under known zooplankton biomass regimes. This basis can be utilised further in future work focusing on spatial and temporal dynamics and climate change scenarios to provide a realistic food consumption estimate for the L. miodon population in Lake Kariba and similar artificial reservoirs.

There are five valid species: Bothriocephalus claviceps (Goeze, 1782), B. cuspidatus Cooper, 1917, B. formosus Mueller & Van Cleave, 1932, B. acheilognathi Yamaguti, 1934, and B. pearsei Scholz, Vargas-Vazquez & Moravec, 1996. B. texomensis Self, 1954 from Hiodon alosoides in the USA, and B. musculosus Baer, 1937 from a cichlid Cichlasoma biocellatum (= C. octofasciatum) which died in an aquarium in Switzerland, are synonymised with B., cuspidatus. B. schilbeodis Cheng & James, 1960 from Schilbeodes insignis in the USA, B. speciosus (Leidy, 1858) Leidy, 1872 from Boleostoma olmstedi in the USA, and B. cestus Leidy, 1885 from Salvelinus sp. in Canada are considered to be species inquirendae until new material for the evaluation of their taxonomic status is available. B. cordiceps (Leidy, 1872) from Salmo (= Salvelinus)fontinalis in North America is in fact a larva (plerocercoid) of a Diphyllobothrium species. The study showed that there have been many misidentifications, mostly of B. cuspidatus erroneously designated as B. formosus or B. claviceps.

J	BRENNAND, TA; SHAW, J				BRENNAND, TA; SHAW, J			TUNNEL CHANNELS AND ASSOCIATED LANDFORMS, SOUTH-CENTRAL ONTARIO - THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR ICE-SHEET HYDROLOGY	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												The Peterborough-Trenton drumlin field and associated meltwater erosion marks (s-forms) were interpreted as the products of erosion by turbulent separated flows within a catastrophically released subglacial meltwater sheet, the Algonquin event. Recent theoretical modelling of ice-sheet hydrology suggests progressive channelization of meltwater during the collapse of such a sheet. Inductive testing of this hypothesis using observations in south-central Ontario forms the crux of this paper. A geometric model of the interaction of rough ice base and bed surfaces gives inferred meltwater flow patterns. Such a rough interactive geometry is suggested as the bed is drumlinized, and flows responsible for drumlins may be expected to have eroded similar forms into the ice base. Three landforms in south-central Ontario; namely tunnel channels, mega-channels, and late-stage sheet-flow scours, are described, and interpreted as evidence of progressive channelization and flow diversion processes, governed by the geometric interactions between the recoupling ice base and its bed and thermodynamic feedbacks within an increasingly discontinuous meltwater sheet. Some fields of transverse ridges within tunnel channels may record meltwater deposition towards the end of the Algonquin event. By contrast, eskers within tunnel channels record a return to seasonally driven meltwater drainage. The Dummer Moraine and the Oak Ridges complex are integrated into a new landform-event sequence for south-central Ontario which provides a framework for further field testing.																			0008-4077	1480-3313				MAR	1994	31	3					505	522		10.1139/e94-045	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/e94-045													WOS:A1994NQ08100005

Double-crested Cormorants During the Chick-rearing Period at a Large Colony in Southern Ontario: Analyses of Chick Diet, Feeding Rates and Foraging Directions	WATERBIRDS												During the last 25 years, North America has experienced a significant increase in Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus). The increase has caused concern among wildlife and fisheries managers dealing with the perceived and/or real impacts of this bird on fisheries. Cormorant foraging and breeding ecology were examined at a large (>6,000 pairs), unmanaged colony in Lake Ontario, Canada. Chick diet, feeding rates and productivity were evaluated during 2006 and 2007. In 2007, the proportion of adult cormorants making long-range foraging trips (more than ten kilometers) during different stages of the breeding season was estimated. Alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) composed greater than 86% of chick diet by mass during both years; suggesting that cormorants did not often prey on sport fish for feeding chicks. Chicks were fed approximately 4.5 times per day in 2006, which was significantly lower than 5.9 feeds per day during 2007. Productivity was high in both years, with 2.2 and 1.9 chicks produced per nest in 2006 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in productivity corresponded with an increase in colony size, from 6,125 to 7,241 pairs. In 2007, approximately one-fifth of the nesting colony foraged at least ten kilometers throughout the breeding season. Cormorants fed their chicks very few sport fish in the Toronto area; however, more work is required to determine whether the consumption of Alewife by cormorants represents competition with sport fish for prey.

Results showed that season had a significant influence on the proportion of infected fish (chi(2) = 19.15, p<0.05) with the prevalence being higher during dry season with 58% (35 out of 60) compared to rainy season with 10% (3 Out of 30).This finding suggests the seasonal occurrence of mature acanthocephalan worm in O. niloticus. However, there was no significant difference in the mean intensity between dry (4.31 +/- 3.68) and rainy (4.00 +/- 2.00) seasons. Infection intensity had a significant positive correlation with length and weight (r = 0.63 and 0.65, respectively, p<0.05) of infected fish. However, there was no significant association between infection intensity and fish condition index. Scanning electron microscopy revealed the number and arrangement of proboscis hooks; hence, classifying the acanthocephalan specimens as belonging to genus Neoechinorhynchus. Specimens were distinguishable with short, globular proboscis armed with 18 hooks radially arranged in 3 circles with 6 hooks each.

Macrozoobenthos was sampled and environmental variables were measured at five sites along the upper to lower reaches (S I at upper reaches, S3 and S4 at middle reaches, and S8 and S9 at lower reaches) in 2007 to 2008. Benthic macroinvertebrates were also collected over three transects in 2009, i.e., T1, T4, and T8, traversing S1, S4, and S8, respectively, and 10-15 sites were set along each transect. Totally, 24 taxa from 5 classes were recorded. Oligochaeta predominated in the macrozoobenthic community in terms of important value (IV), density, and standing crop, among which Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri was prevailing. The annual average density and biomass were 793.8 +/- 92.1 ind. m(-2) and 2.25 +/- 0.32 g m(-2), respectively. There were no clear differences in density and biomass between seasons, but significant horizontal differences revealed a maximum in the upper reaches and minimum at the lower reaches. Both density and biomass negatively correlated with water depth and Secchi depth (SD); density positively correlated with total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) of mixed water samples from the water column (MWSWC) and with TP of local water samples at the bottom (LWSB). Biomass positively correlated with TP of MWSWC. Only water depth (from eight physical and chemical variables) was selected by a stepwise regression model to explain the variation in density and biomass of macrozoobenthos in 2007 to 2008. Bathymetrically, both density and biomass increased with water depth, peaked just below the thermocline, and then decreased gradually. This numerical bathymetric change in Xin'anjiang Reservoir conformed to the patterns of vertical distribution of zoobenthos in oligo- and mesotrophic lakes. The relationship of density and biomass with the main environmental variables, the bathymetric distribution pattern of macrozoobenthos, and the two biological indices (Wright index and Carlander's biotic index) all typified Xin'anjiang Reservoir as oligo- and mesotrophic, with the upper reaches mesotrophic or moderately polluted and the middle and lower reaches oligotrophic or slightly polluted. Three other biological indices (King, Goodnight-Whitley, and Shannon-Weaver) were unsuitable to assess water quality.					zhang, hongcheng/O-9719-2015														0077-0639		978-94-007-2006-0				2012	91						135	153		10.1007/978-94-007-2007-7_9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-2007-7_9	10.1007/978-94-007-2007-7												WOS:000301802900009

STATISTICAL CONTROL OF MERCURY IN SURFACE WATER OF BUCHAREST	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY												Statistical control can be used for monitoring the degree of water pollution in a target zone. The purpose of usage of time series properties is to understand the driving forces and structures that produce the observed data, to fit the data into a model and proceed them to forecasting, monitoring or even feed back and feed forward control. The essential difference between modelling data via time series methods and using the process monitoring methods is that in time series analysis the data points taken over time may have internal structure such as autocorrelation, trend or seasonal variation. This paper uses some of the time series techniques for modelling and analysis of the daily heavy metal monitoring data measured in some important lakes of the Bucharest city. The daily registration of mercury concentrations in surface water forms an univariate time series that consists in single scalar observations recorded sequentially over equal time increments. This time series display periodicity that represents sinusoidal fluctuations over entire week and seasonality over the year. The highest mercury concentrations can be correlated with the intensity of road traffic, which is added to other existing sources.

Apple Ripening Determined by Conventional Methods and the 'NSure' Genetic Assay	XXVIII INTERNATIONAL HORTICULTURAL CONGRESS ON SCIENCE AND HORTICULTURE FOR PEOPLE (IHC2010): INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON POSTHARVEST TECHNOLOGY IN THE GLOBAL MARKET	Acta Horticulturae				28th International Horticultural Congress on Science and Horticulture for People (IHC) / International Symposium on Postharvest Technology in the Global Market	AUG 22-27, 2010	Lisbon, PORTUGAL	Int Soc Hort Sci (ISHS)				Molecular biology techniques are developing rapidly and can now be used as assays to help determine the optimum harvest date for fruit crops. While molecular assays are still more expensive and time consuming than the conventional maturity tests currently used for apples they offer a number of potential advantages, in particular the possibility to detect changes in fruit ripening processes at a very early stage and perhaps in the near future to help predict storage quality outcomes. To adapt a new methodology for practical use requires trialling and comparison with existing methods. When results from different seasons and apple cultivars are available, the suitability and reliability of molecular methodology can be better understood and assessed. This work compares conventional methods for optimum harvest date determination with the genetic testing service, supplied by the Dutch based Company 'Nsure'. The 'Nsure' test measures the expression of genes with relevance to some of the key ripening processes in maturing apples. In 2008 and 2009, three apple cultivars: 'Gala', 'Fuji' and 'Braeburn' from the Lake Constance growing region of Germany were sampled three times in the period leading up to harvest and two times from unpicked trees after the expected optimum harvest date. The conventional ripening parameters: fruit firmness, total soluble solids and starch degradation pattern were used to calculate a 'Streif' ripening index and the optimum harvest date for long term storage. In addition, samples for the respiration rate, ethylene production and internal ethylene were taken. Gene expression at each sampling date was evaluated by 'Nsure' Company. The results from both methods were compared.

The study was conducted in Lake Gardno and Lake Lebsko located in northern Poland. Each of these lakes is characterized by very high mean annual ciliate biomasses of 115 mu g C-1 (Lake Gardno, April 2006 - April 2007), 107 mu g C L-1 (Lake Gardno, February 2007 - February 2008), 85 mu g C L-1 (Lake Lebsko, April - November 2007), and 127 mu g C L-1 (Lake Lebsko, April - September 2008). Ciliate production was estimated using allometric equations and was compared to primary production measured with the light-and-dark bottles method. Annual, depth-integrated ciliate secondary production corresponded to 9 and 11% (Lake Gardno, two consecutive years studied) and 12% (Lake Lebsko, the same value for two growing seasons studied) of primary production. These values exceed the majority of other estimates in the literature, which indicates the high importance of ciliates in such highly-productive, shallow lakes.

Time was represented biologically as degree days. The influences of light intensity, wave height, barometric pressure, and the discharge rate of the Red River were examined using generalized linear models with the quasi-family of distributions. The percentage of the null deviance was found to be an appropriate selection criterion for choosing variables to include in the models. Effort declined throughout the early fishery and declined with increasing winds later in the year. Walleye catch rate declined through the early season. Sauger catch rates increased and then declined as the early season progressed and were associated with indicators of decreased light intensity. The relationship between catch rate and each statistically significant environmental variable was consistent with the habitat preferences of the species under examination.

This state of N saturation leads to adverse impacts on terrestrial ecology and water quality. Due to the complexities of terrestrial carbon-nitrogen cycling, integrated hydrologic-biogeochemical modeling provides a tool to improve our understanding and discern between the impacts of changes in N deposition from changes in other ecosystem processes. A model of biogeochemical processing in alpine watersheds was developed and applied to the Emerald Lake watershed. Simulations of major terrestrial carbon and nitrogen pools and fluxes were adequate. The use of snow cover information to estimate soil temperatures improved model simulations indicating that snow cover processes need to be incorporated into biogeochemical models of seasonally snow covered areas. The model simulated mineral nitrogen processes well but significant changes in denitrification and dissolved organic nitrogen export processes appear to be necessary. Our results also showed that variations in snow cover duration have more of an impact on mineral N export, plant uptake and mineralization than appears possible due to changes in atmospheric deposition.

J	Pack, SM; Miller, GH; Fogel, ML; Spooner, NA				Pack, SM; Miller, GH; Fogel, ML; Spooner, NA			Carbon isotopic evidence for increased aridity in northwestern Australia through the Quaternary	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Carbon isotopic records of bulk soil organic matter from two independent sedimentary sequences in the Lake Gregory region record vegetation change from monsoonal NW Australia. A broad isotopic enrichment of similar to16% through a 9-m-thick sedimentary sequence in the main basin is interpreted to indicate a shift from C-3 to C-4 plant dominance. A second isotopic record from a 4-m-thick sequence recovered southwest of the modern lakes corroborates this conclusion. Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dates of an eolian sand (depth = 60 cm) and fluvial sand (depth = 3 30 cm) from the 9-m sequence are 27.6 +/- 1.4 and 122.4 +/- 9.5 ka, respectively, indicating that the entire record is likely to span several hundred thousand years. C4 plants dominate only after 120 ka. Conversion of C-3 woodland to C-4 grassland requires a decrease in total precipitation and increased seasonality of precipitation, reflecting a long-term trend toward a more and and monsoon-dominated climate regime in NW Australia. The rapid shift from mixed C-3/C-4 to dominantly C-4 vegetation after 120 ka may reflect an acceleration of landscape change in the Late Quaternary. Other Australian records that indicate increased continental aridity in the Late Quaternary support the Lake Gregory evidence. However, neither of the Lake Gregory isotopic records mimics the global oxygen isotope record, suggesting that temperature has not played a significant role in forcing vegetation change in this region.

J	Wronski, T				Wronski, T			Fire induced changes in the foraging behaviour of impala Aepyceros melampus in Lake Mburo National Park, Uganda	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The impact of fire on the foraging behaviour of impala (Aepyceros melampus), was studied in the Lake Mburo National Park, Uganda. Two indices of foraging efficiency were used to establish differences in feeding behaviour in burnt and unburnt control areas. These are acceptable grass/browse abundance (AGA/ABA), expressed in terms of feeding time achieved per 50 steps and food ingestion rate (FIR), expressed as the cumulative percentage. Accumulation of above ground grass biomass was also measured in burnt and control areas. After burning, the grazing efficiency remains constant throughout the dry season, while the browsing time achieved per 50 steps decreases drastically. In the control areas AGA decreased with increasing length of the dry season while ABA increased. When expressed in terms of cumulative percentage (FIR), the results show a significant increase of 31% in foraging time spent grazing and a 24% decrease in foraging time spent browsing, in burnt areas. The results confirm the classification of impalas as intermediate or mixed feeders with a distinct preference for grass. Impala foraging patterns after burning are discussed and compared with investigations on the effect of burning on the behaviour of impalas and Buffon's kob (Kobus kob kob) in other areas of Africa.

River valley, in the state of Rio Grande do Norte, in Northeast Brazil. Spicules were recovered from sediments from two core samples obtained from Lake Fumo and Lake Urtiga, at depths of 0.60 m and 0.96 m, respectively. The following analyses were carried out: phytolith morphotype classification, isotope data (813C, 815N?), radiocarbon dating (AMS), grain size analysis, sediment morphoscopy, and percentage of soil organic matter. Environmental reconstruction indicated seasons with dry and rainy conditions 1940 years BP. Isotope data pointed to the presence of plants (C3 and C4) and algae. Phytolith classification indicated that Poaceae, Cyperaceae, Arecaceae and/or Bromeliaceae occurred at the location. Spicules from the inland sponges Heterorotula fistula; Ephydatia sp.; Dosilia pydanieli; Corvoheteromeyenia heterosclera; Tubella variabilis; Radiospongilla inesi; and Anheteromeyenia sp. were found in the core samples. Reconstruction based on isotope, phytolith and sedimentology results was compared with the spicule data and only D. pydanieli and H. fistula confirmed the other proxy information.

C10S02	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												[1] The satellite scatterometer QuikSCAT wind field has been available every 12 hours on Lake Superior since 19 July 1999. The wind data cover most of the interior area of the lake with a spatial resolution of about 25 km. Driving the three-dimensional Lake Superior circulation model by the QuikSCAT winds, we resimulated the 1999 seasonal variability of currents in Lake Superior. A comparison was made with our previous simulation results, which relied on the wind field interpolated from moored buoys and land-based meteorological stations. The model driven by QuikSCAT winds improved the simulation of the spatial coverage area of the cold band during upwelling favorable wind events and the current jet during downwelling favorable wind events observed along the Keweenaw coast in July - October 1999. A statistical analysis shows that these improvements were mainly reflected in the low-frequency variation of the long-shore current, even though the overall deviation between computed and observed surface temperature and currents was measurably reduced. This study suggests that the wind field constructed from either moored buoys plus land-based meteorological stations or QuikSCAT is not sufficient to provide a reliable and accurate simulation of coastal currents and stratification in Lake Superior. A mesoscale meteorological model assimilated with observed winds on all the available weather measurement sites or stations or QuikSCAT is needed to provide an accurate meteorological forcing for the Lake Superior physical model.

Pond systems, employing a wider range of species, are a means to recycle more nutrients, improve treatment potential and mirror natural ecosystems in ways to sustain the ecosystem. Species of Triglochin, commonly known as water ribbons throughout coastal Australia, are fast-growing submergent macrophytes which seem to be adapted to high nutrient concentrations. In Western Australia, Triglochin huegelii is mainly a submergent plant but its leaves tend to float on the surface in shallow waterways and it has been found seasonally in some ephemeral swamps and lakes. As water receedes, the leaves become emergent. Initial studies using T. huegelii in wastewater treatment experiments has shown that Triglochin has consistently higher concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus than Schoenoplectus validus, an emergent commonly used for wastewater nutrient stripping, in all parts of the plant - leaves, tubers and roots. In some cases, such as in the leaves, twice as much nitrogen and one and a half times more phosphorus is assimilated in the Triglochin tissue. It is also likely that T. huegelii will remove nitrogen and phosphorus at a greater rate than many other types of aquatic macrophytes. The implication is that instead of only planting the perimeter of lagoons, artificial wetlands and constructed basins we should be planting the bulk of the waterway with submergent species such as Triglochin spp. which may be far more effective in stripping nutrients than emergents currently used for that purpose.

Sixteen samples were collected from the pond filling until its drying (about every 15-30 days). A total of 15,000 individuals belonging to 86 taxa (most at species level) was collected during the study. 67 taxa belonged to Insecta (mostly to Coleoptera and Diptera) and 19 to other zoological groups, 6 of which were recorded for the first time in temporary waters. Oligochaetes and dipterans were dominant in the community. The fauna exhibited a remarkable richness and a great turnover of species. The number of taxa was low (9) after the pond was filled (September), increased until a maximum (51) in May and then regularly declined (20) until few days before the pool dried up (early August). This parameter correlated positively with pH values, pond area and wet phase duration. The feeding guilds were represented mostly by detritivores and predators, while the habit organization was dominated by burrowers. The direct relationships between taxonomic diversity and both trophic and habit diversities suggest a good partitioning of food and space resources among taxa. The macrofauna belongs primarily to Group 1 and 2, and secondarily to Group 4 of WIGGINS et al. (1980) classification. The temporal succession of the pond life indicated the existence of three phases, denoted as ''filling'', ''aquatic'' and ''drying'' phases, each characterized by distinctive environmental conditions and faunal groups. There was a high faunal similarity between the first and the last phases due to the great simplicity of the community. The intermediate phase can also include three sub-phases according to the season. The results were compared with data from the few intensive studies on temporary ponds carried out in other countries.																			0003-9136					JUL	1996	137	1					77	94																WOS:A1996VB05800005
J	Dalrymple, SE; Safford, HD				Dalrymple, Sarah E.; Safford, Hugh D.			Natural forest floor clearings around trees in Jeffrey pine forests reduce tree damage and mortality following wildfire	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												In the western United States, trees in pine-dominated forests historically characterized by frequent, low severity wildfires often support deep litter and duff accumulations due to the fire exclusion policies of the last century. These accumulations at the bases of trees can smolder for long periods of time after the passage of fire, which can result in high temperatures, cambial injury, and subsequent tree mortality. As a result, prescribed fire prescriptions often call for the manual removal of litter and duff from the bases of large trees by raking or other means before fire is applied. Here we report on the presence of naturally formed, circular clearings in the soil surface litter layer that occur around the bases of tree boles in seasonally dry forests dominated by Pinus jeffreyi (Jeffrey pine) in eastern California and Baja California (along the eastern edge of the North American Mediterranean-climate zone). We show that such clearings significantly reduce fire severity and tree mortality in surface fires. In the Lake Tahoe Basin (LTB) study area, Jeffrey pine individuals surrounded by clearings experienced much lower bole char heights, and were 1/3 as likely to support crown torching as individuals lacking the clearings; mortality of Jeffrey pine lacking clearings was more than five times higher than individuals surrounded by clearings. Clearings also reduced mortality in incense cedar and white fir. Data from both the LTB and Inyo National Forest (INF) study areas show that clearings are larger and much more common in forests that have recently burned at low severity. In both locations, natural clearings around trees were about four times more common, and existing clearings about three times wider, in recently burned versus long unburned (>60 years) sites. Logistic regression models show that clearing size, specifically the percentage of tree bole surrounded by a clearing, is an important predictor of Jeffrey pine survivorship in low to moderate severity fires, but clearing measures have never been included in previously published assessments of tree survival. We suggest that these previously unreported clearings are important features of Jeffrey pine and related semiarid forests and we recommend that more in-depth studies be made of their occurrence, formation, and ecological relationships.

J	Anderson, RC; Menges, ES				Anderson, RC; Menges, ES			Effects of fire on sandhill herbs: Nutrients, mycorrhizae, and biomass allocation	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Differences in growth responses, tissue and soil inorganic nutrients, and mycorrhizal relationships of four herbaceous species were studied on burned and unburned sandhill sites in south-central Florida, USA. Three species, (Aristida stricta, Liatris tenuifolia var. laevigata, and Pityopsis graminifolia) responded positively to conditions following the burn by increased vegetative growth and flowering. The fourth species, Balduina angustifolia, is a fire-sensitive biennial and its first-year rosettes were, with an occasional exception, unable to survive or resprout following fire. Availability of all soil inorganic nutrients examined (Ca, K, Mg, and P) was low, as were total nitrogen, soil organic matter. and pH. There was a slight nutrient pulse of phosphorus into the soil following burning. For two species (Aristida and Liatris), shoot tissue concentrations of several inorganic nutrients (especially N and P) were higher on the burned site than the unburned site following burning. These differences generally dissipated over time since burning. The high concentration of tissue nutrients postburn followed by a decline on the burned site may result from rapid nutrient uptake after fire and dilution of this concentration following restoration of plant mass. Despite low levels of soil inorganic nutrients, including phosphorus, mycotrophy was absent or weakly developed among the herbaceous species examined, except for the tap-rooted Balduina angustifolia. Colonization of host plants by vesicular mycorrhizal fungi was unaffected by burning. Mycorrhizal inoculum potentials of sandhill soil were extremely low, varying seasonally from (mean +/- 1 SE) 0.3 +/- 0.2 to 3.8 +/- 0.7%.																			0002-9122					JUL	1997	84	7					938	948		10.2307/2446284	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2446284								21708648					WOS:A1997XM01200009
J	Cobelas, MA; García-Morato, CR				Alvarez Cobelas, Miguel; Rojo Garcia-Morato, Carmen			That twenty years is nothing for gravel-pit limnology	LIMNETICA												The past twenty years have witnessed a rise in the analysis of long-term limnological data given the need to know whether global warming is affecting freshwaters, and if so, how. Previous studies indicated that processes affecting ecosystem functioning may develop slowly, thus requiring long-term study, as in the case of the eutrophication-oligotrophication gradient. Here we report annual averages and seasonal variability of meteorological data (air temperature, solar radiation, rainfall) and the main limnological variables (lake level, water temperature, euphotic depth, mixing depth, nitrogen and phosphorus compounds and phytoplankton biomass) for a gravel-pit, seepage lake close to Madrid (Central Spain), collected monthly from 1992 to 2018. Linear trends (both upward and downward), long-term constancy, regime shifts, piecewise patterns and mixed patterns (constant and piecewise) were found for the variables tested, but their variability did not increase over time. Water warming and decreased lake levels were related with atmospheric warming. In turn, these physical changes covaried with nitrate increase and decreases in total phosphorus and phytoplankton biomass. However, the weak relationships between climate- and limnological variables (for example, the lack of rainfall effects on lake level) would indicate that other factors, such as land use, were more influential. Broadly speaking, it would appear that the observed limnological patterns were greatly influenced by the local increase in novel lake basins through mining activities, which led to a decrease in lake level until the year 2000, and the ecological stabilization of a recently created ecosystem, which is an analogous process to that occurring after reservoir construction. The above processes might have partly offset global warming effects in this lake but twenty years is ALMOST nothing within the framework of this fascinating puzzle. Hence longer studies are necessary to gain an accurate picture of gravel-pit limnology, which is urgently needed.																			0213-8409	1989-1806					2021	40	1					169	187		10.23818/limn.40.12	http://dx.doi.org/10.23818/limn.40.12													WOS:000607499500014
J	Castillo, L; Elias, R				Castillo, Luis; Elias, Roberto			DESCRIPTION IN DRY SEASON OF THE MICROHABITAT OF THE TADPOLE OF Telmatobius macrostomus (Peters, 1873) "LAKE JUNIN FROG" IN THE TRIBUTARIES OF LAKE CHINCHAYCOCHA / PERU	ECOLOGIA APLICADA												Telmatobius macrostomus (Peters, 1873) is an endemic species of high Andean rivers and lakes in the center of Junin and Pasco / Peru, categorized as endangered. The present study describes the microhabitat of T. macrostomus tadpoles during the dry season, for this, 10 physicochemical parameters were evaluated in substations (approximate to 100 m2) and six in quadrants (1 m(2)). By means of a non-parametric Kruskal- Wallis test it was determined that none of the parameters evaluated in the substations with the presence (n = 10) and absence (n = 17) of tadpoles of T. macrostomus were not different (p value > 0.05), likewise the quadrants with presence (n = 29) and absence (n = 1108) were not significantly different (p value > 0.05). However, the non-metric scaling analysis and a similarity analysis (ANOSIM) resulted in a significant difference between the quadrants with presence and absence in a single substation (R = 0.50, p = 0.0004). It is established that tadpoles of T. macrostomus live in high aquatic vegetation, near the banks of rivers, in silt-type substrate, minimum depth of 30 cm, associated with the presence of native fish of the genus Orestias and a high diversity of diatoms. Based on the evaluated parameters, it is concluded that T. macrostomus tadpoles are generalists and that some type of microhabitat selection in substations could be related to habitat alteration or feeding factors, but there are characteristics in quadrants observables associated with their presence. Finally, short-term conservation efforts are planned for this species.																			1726-2216	1993-9507				JAN-JUN	2021	20	1					25	34																WOS:000667234500004

SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION FOR CHLOROPHYLL-A ESTIMATION USING SENTINEL-2 IMAGES IN SMALL WATERBODIES	2021 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM IGARSS	IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing IGARSS				IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	JUL 12-16, 2021	ELECTR NETWORK	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers Geoscience & Remote Sensing Soc				Chlorophyll-a concentration (chla) is a useful indicator of harmful algal blooms in early warning systems that use remote sensing data as input. However, its retrieval is challenging in small waterbodies due to the lack of high spatial-resolution water-color sensors and the substantial optical interference of other water constituents. Here, we demonstrate the potential of support vector machines and Sentinel-2 images to retrieve chla in a shallow eutrophic lake (Buffalo Pound Lake, Saskatchewan, Canada). Following validation against in- situ chla measurements over three open water seasons (2017-2019), our proposed method based on Support Vector Regression (SVR) outperforms the most common semi-empirical models, i.e., locally-tuned indices (normalized difference chlorophyll index, 2band, and 3band), as well as the state-of-the-art global empirical model (Mixture Density Network). The superiority of SVR is shown in terms of overall and stratified accuracy, as well as spatial validity. We argue that for small waterbodies where numerous matched pairs of in-situ chla and reflectance are not available, SVR might retrieve chla more accurately than locally-tuned indices and global empirical models.

J	Gilany, IBN; Iqbal, J; Ahmed, A				Gilany, Indus Basin Naseem; Iqbal, Javed; Ahmed, Anwaar			Simulation of glacial lake outburst flood hazard in Hunza valley of upper	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED AND APPLIED SCIENCES												The UIB (Upper Indus Basin) is prone to GLOFs (Glacial Lake Outburst Floods). Physical monitoring of such a large area on a regular basis is a challenging task, especially when the temporal and spatial extent of the hazard is highly variable. The purpose of this study was to map the potentially dangerous glacial lakes and simulate the associated hazard in the downward settlements using HEC-RAS in the GIS environment using Landsat 7 remote sensing data. The study was conducted in Hunza Valley of UIB, where there are several human settlements that are endangered due to the GLOF hazard. Sudden breaches in the unstable moraine dams adjoining receding glaciers may occur because of the rapid and huge accumulation of turbulent water in the glacial lakes. The ASTER GDEM (Digital Elevation Model) is utilized to detect flow accumulation of glacial hazard involving slope, elevation, and orientation of the mountain glaciers. The study results revealed that settlements of Hunza Valley are threatened by the GLOFs hazard. Keeping in view the seasonal growth of the potentially dangerous glacial lakes of Hunza Valley, a low discharge of 3500m(3)/s from a potentially dangerous glacial lake can affect 40%, whereas a moderate discharge of 5000m(3)/s can affect 60%, and a high discharge of 7000m(3)/s can affect 80% of the Shimshal village habitat. The results of the study can provide a platform for the establishment of an early warning and monitoring system to minimize the impact of future GLOFs. Accurate and comprehensive knowledge of potentially dangerous GLOFs is of utmost importance for risk management. A digital repository of GLOFs can enhance the ability to inform policymakers on the vulnerability, risk mitigation, and action/adaptation measures. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by IASE.

J	Greene, BS				Greene, Brenda S.			Estimating the distribution, population status, and trends of New Zealand scaup (Aythya novaeseelandiae)	NOTORNIS												New Zealand scaup (Aythya novaeseelandiae) counts are collated from a total of 12,145 site visits nationally between 1888 and 2018 to estimate their distribution, population status, and trends. Based on systematic counts of large flocks on lakes between 1984-2018, there are about 11,000 New Zealand scaup nationally. This estimate must be interpreted with caution, as if birds are highly mobile the risk of overestimating the population is high. The distribution of New Zealand scaup strongholds (>50 adults) is compared to historical descriptions and trends in water quality. As lakes become more eutrophic over time, the birds move and the population declines. Research should focus on aerial vs ground counts, telemetry/satellite and/or banding studies of bird movement, gender, diet, predation, and littoral zone quantity and quality (<10 m deep). To achieve this, it is recommended that a national waterbird management and monitoring plan be developed.																			0029-4470	1177-7680					2021	68	2					108	130																WOS:000671674300002

Contribution of Solar Radiation to the Long-Term Dynamics of Hydro-Ecological Parameters of Lake Ecosystems under Variable Nutrient Loading: Case Study on Naroch Lakes	CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY												Results of the continuous monitoring of the Naroch lake system, which includes eutrophic Lake Batorino, mesotrophic Lake Myastro, and oligomesotrophic Lake Naroch, have been used to study the factors that largely affect the long-term dynamics of the lakes ecosystem under variable nutrient loading. A set of continuous series of average seasonal values of eight parameters from each ecosystem over 1978-2015 is analyzed using the SSA and PCA methods. The second principal component (F2), which contributes 15.3, 20.5, and 22.1% to the dynamics of the ecosystems of lakes Myastro, Batorino, and Naroch, respectively, is associated with three parameters that reflect the processes of formation and decomposition of the organic matter. A comparison of the periods of the dominant cyclical components of principal component F2 and related ecosystem parameters allows us to interpret the second main factor behind these components as activity from solar radiation.

Iliamna Lake has been home to Indigenous Peoples of Central Yup'ik, Dena'ina,Alutiiq (or Sugpiaq), and other language groups for generations. Many Iliamna Lake residents in the twenty-first century have multicultural heritages because of intermarriages and sharing territorial boundaries. When telling about place names, Iliamna Lake Yup'ik Elders often weave their personal experiences and local histories into their narratives, such as their seasonal routes and the arrival of newcomers in the region. My research revealed that telling and retelling stories of places enables people to visualize their landscapes while affirming and reinforcing the knowledge that has enabled them to survive and thrive in the region for many generations. Ethnogeography addresses, from community perspectives, how these cultural landscapes intertwine with local histories and changes in the land.																			0820-0300						2021		52					5	28		10.22584/nr52.2021.001	http://dx.doi.org/10.22584/nr52.2021.001													WOS:000744202900002

Seasonal and Annual Probabilistic Forecasting of Water Levels in Large Lakes (Case Study of the Ladoga lake)	INTERNATIONAL LETTERS OF NATURAL SCIENCES												The production functions of water-dependent sectors of the economy can include the water level in the lake as a natural resource. This characteristic must be able to reliably predict for the effective functioning of sectors of the economy. In the article the main attention is paid to the methods of forecasting based on the extrapolation of natural variations of the large lakes water level. As an example, Lake Ladoga is considered. In this paper, it is assumed that the level varies accordingly to a stochastic multi-cycle process with principal energy-containing zones in frequency bands associated with seasonal and multi-annual variations. Hence, the multi-year monthly and yearly averaged time series are represented by the ARIMA (auto-regression integrated moving average) processes. Forecasts are generated by using of the seasonal ARIMA-models, which take into account not only the seasonal but also the evolution non-stationarity. To compare the forecasts and the actual values, the relative errors are computed. It is shown that implementation of the models mainly allows receiving good and excellent forecasts.

The following key points are emphasized; a) Problems in inland fisheries b) Potential reasons of decrease in natural fish stocks c) Problem solutions and recommendations to improve the inland fisheries. The data obtained from a survey administered to 59 fishermen was evaluated using the Non-Linear Canonical Correlation Analysis method. According to the findings of the study: a) The most important problems encountered in fisheries; according to the fishermen with high education level, while the marketing and changes in the water level of the lakes, the fishermen with low education and income level, unlicensed hunting, the lack of punishment and electric hunting are problems b) Fishermen with a high level of education think that fishing with illegal fishing gears during the prohibited fishing season, and those with a low level of education and income are of opinion that small fishing is an important factor in the decrease of natural fish stocks c) Fishermen with high education-income sources adopt the idea of improving legal regulations and complying with them, whereas fishermen with a low-level of education and income think that problems in marketing should be eliminated as a solution to the problem in the fisheries. Results indicate that increasing the effectiveness of the practices that consider the opinions/suggestions of fishermen will contribute to the management and sustainability of fisheries in the region.					; Pulatsü, Serap/AAF-1648-2020	Pulatsu, Serap/0000-0001-5277-417X; 													1300-1590	2148-3140					2021	38	1					11	19		10.12714/egejfas.38.1.02	http://dx.doi.org/10.12714/egejfas.38.1.02													WOS:000644863800002

In March and Augest of 2016, sediments and surrounding soils were collected from the east (6 sampling sites), southwest (5 sampling sites) and northwest parts (5 sampling sites) of the Caohai wetland. Organochlorine pesticides content in samples were analyzed, and their pollution characteristics and pollution sources were discussed. The results showed that the average content of HCHs and DDTs in surficial sediments of Caohai Wetland was 3.36 ng.g(-1) and 8.56 ng.g(-1), respectively. The mean value of HCHs in soils from surrounding cropland, forestland and swamp meadow was 5.13 ng.g(-1), 2.84 ng.g(-1) and 3.16 ng.g(-1), respectively. While, The mean value of DDTs in soils from surrounding cropland, forestland and swamp meadow was 10.32 ng.g(-1), 3.00 ng.g(-1) and 8.58 ng.g(-1), respectively. Generally, the content of organochlorine pesticides in surficial sediments of Caohai Lake is higher in dry season than those in flood season, but the content of DDTs in sediments of the southwest and east parts of Caohai Lake is slightly higher in flood season than those in dry season. The contents of DDTs, HCHs and their sum in surficial sediments from the southwest part of the Caohai Lake were higher than those from the northwest part followed by from the east part.

Great Blue Herons preferred large water-bodies ( greater than or equal to350 ha), whereas Great Egrets fed most often at small ponds (<25 ha). Forty-nine percent of Great Blue Herons used wetlands 301 - 400 hectares in size and 83% of Great Egrets fed in wetlands <100 ha in size. Great Blue Herons selected large wetlands more often than expected both at the regional (30-km radius) and local (4-km radius) scales. Habitat use by Great Egrets was in proportion to availability at the regional scale, but they selected smaller wetlands for feeding more often than expected at a local scale. The median flight distance of Great Blue Herons was 2.7 km, similar to distances reported elsewhere. Great Egrets flew farther to feeding sites than Great Blue Herons, and flew farther (median = 13.5 km) than reported in other geographic areas.

Linhos lake (Figueira da Foz, Portugal) is a good example of one of these ecosystems, in which human intervention was responsible for its environmental degradation and led to its precocious terrestrialization. Physico-chemical conditions and zooplankton community structure were studied in Linhos lake, in order to evaluate ecosystem functioning and to acquire baseline information. The system is characterised by high oxygen depletion. Spatial heterogeneity was confirmed by the existence of significant differences in total densities for the three zooplanktonic groups. Rotifers were the most abundant group attaining their maximum density in April (2251.1 ind/l). Keratella quadrata, K. cochlearis, Polyarthra vulgaris, Filinia terminalis and Hexarthra mira were the main abundant species. Correspondence analysis suggested temperature as the main controlling factor in species seasonality. In order to prevent the precocious disappearance of the lake some restoration measures were proposed based on zooplankton community structure. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Cicerone, DS; Stewart, AJ; Roh, Y				Cicerone, DS; Stewart, AJ; Roh, Y			Diel cycles in calcite production and dissolution in a eutrophic basin	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Calcite production is understood largely as a longer-term phenomenon (e.g., seasonal whitings) that can occur in hardwater lakes, and is significant ecologically because it can slow the rate of eutrophication by reducing, through adsorption, the availability of nutrients to primary producers. In this study we show that rapid changes in concentration of dissolved CO, by photosynthesis and respiration within a eutrophic basin generated strong day-to-night cycles in calcite production and dissolution. Diel cycles in calcite production and dissolution were large enough that they could drive secondary diel cycles in the availability of metals that strongly sorb to the surfaces of calcite particles. We explored the possibility of the secondary diel cycling of metals by intensive 7-d in situ monitoring of water-quality conditions in a shallow, eutrophic spill-control basin near an industrial facility in eastern Tennessee; inspecting data from a 7-year record of water-quality parameters for this basin; analyzing physicochemical characteristics and mineralogic composition of sediments in the basin; and conducting laboratory experiments to characterize the interaction of calcite with Cd, under solid-liquid nonequilibrium conditions. We found that the basin accumulated and stored calcite. In situ monitoring showed that calcite was produced during daylight, and tended to dissolve again at night; the calcite production and dissolution processes seemed to be modulated by dissolved-phase CO, dynamics, in concert with large diel fluctuations in pCa, pH, and PO2. Laboratory experiments showed a rapid interaction (<6 h) of Cd with calcite, in response to dissolved CO, changes. Thus, concentrations of dissolved Cd can vary over daily cycles, mediated by diel changes in calcite production and dissolution. Thermodynamic considerations suggest that other metals, such as Zn, Sr, Ni, and Ba, may demonstrate this behavior as well.					stewart, arthur/D-8471-2012; Cicerone, Daniel/AAP-6202-2021	stewart, arthur/0000-0003-1968-5997; 													0730-7268	1552-8618				OCT	1999	18	10					2169	2177		10.1002/etc.5620181008	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/etc.5620181008								29857644					WOS:000082814500008
J	Georgakakos, KP; Bae, DH; Jeong, CS				Georgakakos, KP; Bae, DH; Jeong, CS			Utility of ten-day climate model ensemble simulations for water resources applications in Korean watersheds	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												We demonstrate the use of a quantitative measure of the effectiveness of using climate model simulations of surface precipitation and temperature for water resources applications involving extremes of watershed average precipitation and temperature, and watershed discharge. This diagnostic measure is considered in association with the use of climate information to condition ensemble seasonal predictions of watershed variables. Seven watersheds in the Korean peninsula constitute the application sites. The climate model effectiveness is expressed by a utility index E-P that measures the ability of the climate model simulations of an indicator variable (i.e., nodal precipitation or temperature) to discriminate observed distributions of the highs and lows of a watershed target variable (i.e., mean areal precipitation and temperature as well as outlet discharge). Monte Carlo simulations provide estimates of the significance of the E-p values. For apparently the first time, ten-member ensemble simulations of daily surface precipitation and temperature from the Korean Meteorological Agency climate model are used to evaluate the climate-model utility index E-P for a temporal interval of 10 days for each application watershed. The results show that, in spite of the high uncertainty of climate simulations, there are several Korean watersheds that can benefit from the use of climate model simulations of high temporal resolution for planning and management studies that involve precipitation, temperature and discharge. In particular, seasonal ensemble prediction of watershed variables stands to gain from conditioning on high-temporal resolution climate forecasts.																			0920-4741	1573-1650				DEC	2005	19	6					849	872		10.1007/s11269-005-5605-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-005-5605-x													WOS:000233530900009

An analysis of dry weight, ash free dry weight, chlorophyll a, phaeophytin and primary productivity of periphyton was carried out. The first experiment lasted from August to December 1993, the second from February to June 1994. Tubes were removed after 7, 14, 21, 28, 60, 90 and 119 days of incubation. In the 1st experiment, the periphytic community reached a higher biomass after the 4th week of colonization (28th day), in the 2nd experiment after the 2nd week (14th day). This discrepancy is related to seasonal differences in environmental factors (water temperature, nutrients concentrations and water discharge) that determine initial colonization. After the first stages of colonization, the biomass and primary productivity of periphyton reached their maximum values after the 60th day of incubation. In both experiments, three developmental phases could be discerned. In the initial phase, an exponential growth was observed. In the second phase, the bioderm reached its maximum biomass and productivity. In the third phase, a decrease of biomass and productivity occurred.

Recent changes in the vegetation occurred in the period following lake restoration measures. Between 1987 and 1993, the dominance of Potamogeton pectinatus decreased, while Charophyte 'meadows' expanded over the same time interval. The pattern of change of the dominant macrophyte species might result from changes in the underwater light climate. Seasonally persistent clear water patches associated with the Chara meadows have been observed in the last few years. The interaction between submerged macrophyte vegetation succession and water transparency in the lakes is discussed.																			0018-8158					DEC 6	1996	340	1-3					115	120		10.1007/BF00012742	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00012742													WOS:A1996WJ83800019

These analyses were complemented by image analysis of backscattered scanning electron images, coupled with energy dispersive spectrometry analysis using a scanning electron microscope. Using this new information, nine sedimentary facies were identified based on distinct geochemical, sedimentological and morphological characteristics at both the macro and the microscopic scale:Facies 1: massive deposit during Termination 1 (T1),Facies 2: T1 varved sediment,Facies 3: early Holocene varved sediment,Facies 4: volcanic ash-rich sediment,Facies 5: mid-Holocene varved sediment,Facies 6: disturbed sediment,Facies 7: massive sediment,Facies 8: clay-rich layer,Facies 9: fecal pellet-rich sediment.We determined how these analyses reinforced or refined previous interpretations about the sedimentary processes responsible for their deposition, their sedimentary environments and/or their provenance with seasonal to sub-seasonal resolution. Each lithofacies has distinctive chemical and sedimentological signatures, which can be used to establish sediment provenance with seasonal to sub-seasonal resolution, and to help understand paleoclimatic variations.

Sustainability of natural resource use for an Amazonian indigenous group	REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE												This research examines how the Kandozi indigenous group governs access to fish and timber for sale and evaluates their perceptions of sustainability of those natural resources. The Kandozi occupy a biodiverse tropical forest in the northern Peruvian Amazon with lakes and seasonally flooded areas. Qualitative methods and a comparative examination of access to resources were used to explore current processes that shape access and the people's perceptions of their benefit from natural resources. Results indicated that environmental heterogeneity, kinship, land tenure, the legal framework, and knowledge all shaped access with some differences due to the dissimilar natures of fish and timber. This research concludes that the sustainability of this and similar systems are dependent upon the moment at which the analysis is done, because of the changing needs of people over time, in addition to changes in external factors and the natural variations that occur in the resources used. The range of relations and interactions among different processes that shape access, and the historically contingent characteristic of access and its evolution over time, help better understand the complexity of a given social-ecological system.

Uncertainty exists on whether veligers in residual water (water remaining in boats after draining) are capable of creating new infestations. Over 100 samples of residual water from boats which were exiting Minnesota lakes with established zebra mussel populations were collected in July and August over three boating seasons (2013-2015). The majority of the boats were sport fishing boats, with most of the samples coming from live wells and bilges. Very few veligers were found in these samples, with over 90% of the samples containing 5 or fewer veligers, and 70% had zero veligers. Residual water volumes were generally less than 400 ml, and there was no correlation between volumes of water and numbers of veligers. Due to factors such as low veliger density, dispersion and high veliger mortality, residual water may present a low risk for spread of this invasive species.																			1989-8649					SEP	2016	7	3					235	240		10.3391/mbi.2016.7.3.03	http://dx.doi.org/10.3391/mbi.2016.7.3.03													WOS:000422637100003

Ciliates are incorporated into budgets and models describing ecosystem functioning. However, data for the parameterization and validation of models remain insufficient. In this study, annual production to biomass (P/B) ratios of pelagic ciliates were estimated in four lakes of different trophic status and at two sites located in the coastal zone of the Baltic Sea. All study sites were located in the temperate zone. The calculations were based on bulk data reflecting seasonal changes in ciliate production, which was estimated using an allometric equation. The annual ciliate P/B ratio for surface waters was 308 +/-81 yr(-1) (mean +/- standard deviation). There was no statistically significant relationship between the mean annual ciliate biomass in particular water bodies and the annual P/B ratio. In the near-bottom waters, the annual P/B ratio was 78 +/-39 yr(-1). Because of the possible food limitation of ciliate growth and reconstructions of the community due to changes in environmental conditions, the ciliate P/B ratio applied in models of temperate waters should range from 50% to 100% of the P/ B ratios estimated in this study.

Remote sensing technology is crucial for fast mapping with low cost. However, besides the inherent classification errors in the land cover products, numerous illogical transitions exist between the neighboring time points. In this study, we introduce a series of logical codes for all the land cover types according to the ecological rules in the study area. The codes represent the transformational logicality of species between different seasons. The classification performance and the codes for all the seasons are imposed on the initial land cover maps which have been produced independently by the conventional hierarchical strategy. We exploit the proposed modified hierarchical mapping strategy to map the land cover of Poyang Lake Basin area, Middle China. The illogical transitions between neighboring seasons and the accuracies based on the labeled samples are calculated for both the initial and modified strategies. The number of illogical pixels have been reduced by 13%-35% for different seasons and the average accuracy has been improved by 9.7% for the specific land cover maps. The accuracy of land cover changes has also presented great improvement of the proposed strategy. The experimental results have suggested the scheme is effective.																				2220-9964				SEP	2016	5	9							165	10.3390/ijgi5090165	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi5090165													WOS:000385532000018

The gerbils were collected over a 2-year period using Sherman live and Victor hold-fast snap traps in permanent 4.5-ha grids. A total of 664 individuals were captured over 13 650 trap nights, giving an overall trap success rate of 4.9%. Trap success varied between seasons with and without crops in the field but not between habitat types. At this site, the breeding activity of this species is seasonal. All individuals whose stomachs were analyzed ate a wide range of items, indicating omnivory in this species at this site; however, seeds were the most preferred diet category, with a mean contribution of 50.4%, followed by arthropods, with a mean contribution of 25.7%. Other plant materials became important during the very dry periods.

J	Hargrove, JW				Hargrove, JW			Factors affecting density-independent survival of an island population of tsetse flies in Zimbabwe	ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA												Analysis is presented of the factors affecting survival probability in populations of tsetse flies Glossina morsitans morsitans Westwood and G. pallidipes Austen (Diptera: Glossinidae) on Antelope Island, Lake Kariba, Zimbabwe. For mature male and female adult G. m. morsitans mean temperature (T-bar) accounted for 70 and 50%, respectively, of the variance in mark-recapture estimates of survival when the flies were not subjected to trapping. Saturation deficit (SD) only accounted for 36 and 33%, respectively. Maximum temperature (T-max) and SD accounted for 36-42% of the variance in male and female G. pallidipes. For the corresponding Moran curve estimates of the survival over all developmental stages, SD lagged by three weeks accounted for 61 and 41% of the variance for male and female G. m. morsitans, respectively, and 64 and 56% for G. pallidipes. The corresponding figures for plots against T-max were 44, 23, 23, and 21%, respectively. The same patterns were seen in the whole data set once allowance was made for the effect of trapping on survival and for an effect of season, correlated with an index of photosynthetic activity. For male G. m. morsitans there was a significant effect of saturation deficit, but not temperature, on immature survival. Decreased adult survival at high temperatures results from the need to feed more frequently and hence to take more risks per unit time. High saturation deficits result directly in reduced emergence of healthy flies from pupae.																			0013-8703	1570-7458				AUG	2001	100	2					151	164		10.1046/j.1570-7458.2001.00858.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1570-7458.2001.00858.x													WOS:000170949900002
J	Mwendera, EJ; Saleem, MAM				Mwendera, EJ; Saleem, MAM			Hydrologic response to cattle grazing in the Ethiopian highlands	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												The effect of grazing pressure on infiltration, runoff, and soil loss was studied on a natural pasture during the 1995 rainy season in the Ethiopian highlands. The study was conducted on 0.01 ha plots established on sites with 0-4% and 4-8% slopes at the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) Debre Zeit research station, 50km south of Addis Ababa. The grazing regimes were: light grazing stocked at 0.6 animal-unit-months (AUM) ha(-1); moderate grazing stocked at 1.8 AUM ha(-1); heavy grazing stocked at 3.0 AUM ha(-1); very heavy grazing stocked at 4.2 AUM ha(-1); very heavy grazing on ploughed soil stocked at 4.2 AUM ha(-1); and a control with no grazing. Heavy to very heavy grazing pressure significantly increased surface runoff and soil loss and reduced infiltrability of the soil. It was observed that fine textured soils were more susceptible to trampling effects than coarse textured soils, and that reduction in infiltration rates was greater on soils which had been tilled and exposed to very heavy trampling. The problems of high runoff and erosion rates on the upper slopes is likely to be exacerbated by the fact that during the rainy season higher grazing pressure is exerted on the upper than lower slopes. Sediments produced from the highlands, which form headwaters of major rivers in the region, are likely to pollute streams and lakes and pile up on bottom-lands, in stream channels, and in reservoirs. With some modifications, the plot design presented here can be used for assessing livestock impacts on natural resources on different landforms at large scales such as watersheds. How the same amount of livestock mass dispersed by different livestock species impacts on the grazing lands needs to be studied further.

J	Thompson, AJ; Sinsabaugh, RL				Thompson, AJ; Sinsabaugh, RL			Matric and particulate phosphatase and aminopeptidase activity in limnetic biofilms	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Biofilms are a major nexus for biogeochemical transformations in inland waters. A defining feature of biofilms is an extracellular polysaccharide matrix. One of the proposed functions of the matrix is retention of extracellular enzymes. We investigated this function by following the kinetics of alkaline phosphatase (AP) and leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) in shaded and exposed limnetic biofilms developed on glass slides. Organic matter (OM) accumulation and chlorophyll content were also measured. Biofilm was scraped from the slides and partitioned in matric and particulate (ectocellular plus detrital bound) fractions. In addition to enzyme activity, the matric fraction was analyzed for carbohydrate and protein content. Over the May to October study period, matric K-m values were significantly higher (by 30 to 50%) than particulate values for both enzymes in both treatments (n = 44). V-max values were significantly higher in the particulate fraction for both enzymes in both treatments. Matric activity as a fraction of total activity averaged about 25 % (3:1 ratio particulate: matric) for both enzymes, suggesting that the matrix was retaining enzymes. This was corroborated by principal component analysis which in general tied matric enzyme activity with matric carbohydrate and protein content and with OM accumulation and linked phosphatase activity to chlorophyll. There was no correlation between matric and particulate enzyme activities and both varied widely. During periods of seasonal turnover in dominant algal populations, matric activity exceeded particulate. Matric enzymes appear to be a significant community resource whose activity may affect the dynamics of biofilm communities.																			0948-3055	1616-1564				MAR 31	2000	21	2					151	159		10.3354/ame021151	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame021151													WOS:000086766400005
J	Colson, J; Cojan, I; Thiry, M				Colson, J; Cojan, I; Thiry, M			A hydrogeological model for palygorskite formation in the Danian continental facies of the Provence Basin (France)	CLAY MINERALS												The Danian of the Provence basin (SE France) is characterized by a strong subatmospheric alteration processes throughout the basin. A wide range of facies, depositional and weathering, were recognized in an interval of 5 Myr and include floodplain fine-grained alluvium, palustrine limestones, playa dolostones, mottled palaeosols, vadose and phreatic calcretes, and phreatic dolocretes. Palygorskite was invariably found in laminar, massive and honeycomb vadose calcretes and phreatic dolocretes, as well as in playa dolostones, and only exceptionally in floodplain siltstones, nodular calcretes and palustrine limestones. Regardless of the facies, palygorskite is associated with smectites. An authigenic origin, based on the morphology of the fibres and the vertical distribution of clay minerals, is proposed for palygorskites in all of the facies. The simultaneous occurrence of palygorskite in these environments is interpreted as a sign of a stable seasonal semi-arid climate and low detrital input during a period of low lake level (similar to 0.5 Myr). The occurrence of authigenic palygorskite in siltstones around the lake was attributed to the rising of the water table, retention of the already saturated water in the pore spaces of the sediment, and its subsequent evaporation in a confined environment. A hydrogeological model is proposed for the distribution of palygorskite. The elongated shape of the Provence basin enhanced the influence of lateral inflow of freshwater during the low lake period which explains the distribution of palygorskite in different environments of the Provence basin as well as spatial distribution of phreatic calcretes and dolocretes. During the high lake level, palygorskite formed in the few remaining ephemeral ponds and on the floodplain along the lake margin.																			0009-8558	1471-8030				JUN	1998	33	2					333	347		10.1180/000985598545516	http://dx.doi.org/10.1180/000985598545516													WOS:000074050000014

Emission of phosphine in intertidal marshes of the Yangtze Estuary	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												Emission of phosphine, a gaseous form of P, is presently considered a potential pathway of the P biogeochemical cycle in aquatic sediments. This study investigated the emission fluxes of phosphine and its potential production mechanisms in the intertidal marshes of the Yangtze Estuary. It is shown that the relatively high emission fluxes of phosphine were measured in warm seasons, with the values of 3.85-24.9 ng m(-2) h(-1) and 4.21-36.5 ng m(-2) h(-1) in August and September, respectively. In contrast, lower fluxes of phosphine appeared in May (1.23-6.32 ng m(-2) h(-1)) and January (0.21-0.91 ng m(-2) h(-1)). Also, the fluxes of phosphine were generally higher in the freshwater marsh, compared with the brackish marsh. The spatio-temporal pattern of phosphine emissions was observed to be mainly associated with sediment structure, temperature and salinity. Meanwhile, the significant correlations of phosphine emissions with sedimentary P and alkaline phosphatase activities reflect that phosphine probably derives from the microbial transformations of PO4 and organic P. In addition, it is estimated that approximately 1.08 +/- 106 g of phosphine is released annually from sediments into the pelagic water of the Yangtze Estuary. Therefore, it is concluded that phosphine emissions may be an important internal source of P, making a significant contribution to the occurrence of algal blooms especially during warm seasons.

Quercitol plays a key role in stress tolerance of Eucalyptus leptophylla (F. Muell) in naturally occurring saline conditions	ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY												Understanding trees adaptation to arid, saline conditions is a major challenge for catchment revegetation in Australia. The accumulation of low molecular weight solutes is an established response of trees to the effects of salt and/or drought stress. Recent studies have shown that quercitol - a cyclitol - contributes significantly towards the adjustment of osmotic potential in some species of Eucalyptus. The present study investigated the role of quercitol in leaf tissues of Eucalyptus leptophylla (F. Muell) under fluctuating environmental stresses. Analysis of leaf tissues from trees growing at distances between 0 and 125 m from hyper-saline lakes suggests that quercitol contributes significantly to the adjustment of osmotic potential induced by drought in E. leptophylla. The presence of substantial concentrations of quercitol in xylem sap suggests that quercitol plays additional roles in signalling amelioration of osmotic stress in myrtaceous species. Quercitol concentrations fluctuate in both xylem and leaf tissues on a seasonal basis, suggesting a form of environmental regulation of solutes. The capacity of soil profiles to store rainwater, rather than proximity to hyper-saline groundwater largely determined osmotic stress in studied trees. Understanding such avoidance/tolerance mechanisms will be crucial to advance tree selection and breeding for stress tolerance. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The dynamic character of these sulfides and their importance for the sequestering of contaminating trace elements prompted this study of the sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) involved in their production. We estimated parameters indicative of the distribution and activity of SRB in relation to season, site, and depth. Most probable number estimates and quantitative PCR assays of an SRB-specific functional gene, alpha-adencisine 5'-phosphosulfate reductase, indicated 10(3) to 10(6) cultivable cells and 10(5) to 10(7) gene copy numbers g(-1) dry wt sediment, respectively. Although culture-based estimates of SRB abundance correlated poorly with site, season, depth, total S, or pore water SO4, non-culture-based estimates of SRB abundance were markedly higher at contaminated sites and positively correlated with pore water SO4. Ex situ estimates of (SO4)-S-35 respiration and acid volatile sulfides abundance also showed strong among-site effects, indicating elevated sulfidogenesis at contaminated sites.

Chemical signals and habitat selection by three zooplankters in Andean Patagonian ponds	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Zooplankton may react differently to chemical signals produced by macrophytes in shallow systems. They may be attracted by macrophytes, as the plants may be used as a refuge against predators, or the plants may have a repellent effect (e.g. when the plants are a habitat for numerous invertebrate predators or fish). In fishless Patagonian ponds, the structural complexity provided by macrophytes modulates the rate of predation on zooplankton by the invertebrate predator Mesostoma ehrenbergii (Turbellaria). 2. We performed a field study to analyse the coexistence of M. ehrenbergii and three of its prey (two copepods, the calanoid Boeckella gracilis and the cyclopoid Acanthocyclops robustus, and the cladoceran Ceriodaphnia dubia) in four ponds. In two of the ponds, we carried out day and night sampling to evaluate the influence of macrophytes on the distribution of these zooplankters. 3. In laboratory experiments, we analysed the response of the zooplankters to the chemical signals produced by macrophytes (the emergent Juncus pallescens and the submerged Myriophyllum quitense), the predator M. ehrenbergii and the 'alarm signal' provided by a homogenate of conspecifics. 4. Our field studies demonstrated the coexistence of M. ehrenbergii and the selected prey in different seasons and that A. robustus and C. dubia choose the vegetated area (a mixed bed of J. pallescens and M. quitense) over the non-vegetated area. The habitat choice experiments indicated that the presence of M. ehrenbergii may directly affect the habitat selection of B. gracilis, because this zooplankter swam away from the predator. In addition, Mesostoma may indirectly affect the habitat selection of the cyclopoid copepod A. robustus and the cladoceran C. dubia as both zooplankters exhibited a negative response to the alarm signal produced by crushed conspecifics. 5. The presence of the submerged M. quitense did not affect the horizontal movements of any of the zooplankters studied. In contrast, the emergent macrophyte J. pallescens elicited a positive response of B. gracilis, suggesting that this aquatic plant may act as a predation refuge. 6. Our results suggest that predator avoidance behaviour can occur in fishless environments in response to a tactile invertebrate predator like Mesostoma. In addition, the refuge effect of emergent macrophytes, enhancing the survival of pelagic zooplankters, may act as a key factor in stabilizing predator-prey interactions in fishless Patagonian ponds, as has been widely recorded in northern temperate lakes with fish.

Sedimentary facies indicate that the Bayan Mandahu redbeds were deposited in semiarid, alluvial to eolian environments. An assemblage of fossil vertebrates found in the Bayan Manduhu consists of ceratopsian, ankylosaurian, and theropod dinosaurs; turtles; crocodiles; and small lizards and mammals. Six different kinds of fossil vertebrate eggs are present. The most common fossil vertebrates occur in association with eolian deposits and are interpreted as the remains of autochthonous ''faunal'' components, many of which died in situ during sandstorm events. In contrast, rare and fragmentary specimens of large dinosaurs occur in coarse-grained alluvial deposits and are interpreted as the remains of allochthonous faunal components. The low diversity of this fossil assemblage and overall small to medium size of its constituents indicate a relatively stressed paleoenvironment, an interpretation which is compatible with our sedimentological conclusions. A diverse trace fossil assemblage is present and includes rhizoliths and endogenic traces. Endogenic traces are well preserved and typically associated with eolian deposits, suggesting that the deposits were at least seasonally damp and cohesive. The opinion that the Late Cretaceous Gobi Basin was a large inland lake, still advocated by some authors, cannot be maintained within the context of our sedimentologic and paleontologic data. In contrast with the perennial lacustrine sedimentation that was characteristic of the underlying Lower to lower Upper Cretaccous units in the Gobi Basin, the Bayan Mandahu redbeds and correlative Djadokhta Formation mark a pronounced shift toward eolian and intermittent lacustrine sedimentation in an increasingly arid climate.

J	LANTRY, BF; STEWART, DJ				LANTRY, BF; STEWART, DJ			ECOLOGICAL ENERGETICS OF RAINBOW SMELT IN THE LAURENTIAN GREAT-LAKES - AN INTERLAKE COMPARISON	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												We developed an energetics model for rainbow smelt Osmerus mordax to quantify its role as a producer and a predator in Great Lakes ecosystems. We measured the weight (W, g) and temperature (T, degrees-C) dependences of routine metabolism: R (cal . g-1 . h-1) = 0.3646 . W-0.216. e0.036 T. We evaluated seasonal and ontogenetic patterns of rainbow smelt energy density. Seasonal and size-dependent diet composition was estimated based on an extensive analysis of smelt diets in Lakes Michigan and Ontario and a synthesis of published diet data for all of the Great Lakes. For each lake, we employed lake-specific temperature regimes, growth rates, mortality rates, and abundance estimates. Model simulations for the average individual rainbow smelt in the various lakes revealed gross food conversion efficiencies (GCE) of 13.8-15.8% averaged over all age-classes. For the youngest age-class, GCE was usually close to 20% and two or three times greater than for age-classes 4 and 5. An empirical estimate of daily ration in Lake Michigan in late August was between 0.017 and 0.037 g food/g smelt, depending on the value assumed for stomach evacuation rate. Our model predicted a ration of about 0.022 g . g-1 for that same period. Total annual rainbow smelt production and predation were about 100 times greater in Lake Erie than in Lake Superior. Biomass-specific consumption (C:B) ratios per age-class in Lake Michigan were highest for rainbow smelt of ages 0 and 1 (14.64 and 9.00) and lowest for ages 4 and 5 (4.60 and 4.54). Production was concentrated in the first three age-classes in all the lakes and ages 0 and 1 accounted for about 87% of the total production in Lake Erie. Population GCE was highest in Lake Erie (20.4%) and lowest in Lake Ontario (15.6%). Production: biomass (P:B) ratios varied from 1.54 in Lake Erie to 1.10 in Lake Ontario. The highest P:B ratio for any age-class was 2.97 for age-0 rainbow smelt in Lake Erie and the lowest was 0.29 for age-4 fish in Lake Huron. Simulations indicated that rainbow smelt biomass is concentrated in age-classes that may be thermally segregated from salmonine predators and that increased mortality of older smelt age-classes can reduce predation by smelt on other fishes.																			0002-8487					SEP	1993	122	5					951	976		10.1577/1548-8659(1993)122<0951:EEORSI>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1993)122<0951:EEORSI>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1993MJ44000025

Impact-recovery patterns of water quality in temporary wetlands after fire retardant pollution	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Fire retardants, which are used in wildland fire prevention and extinguishing operations, can cause eutrophi cation of surface waters. We measured water quality in artificially constructed outdoor ponds over three hydrological cycles to determine impact-recovery trajectories in retardant-contaminated, temporary wetlands. We used a multiple before-after control-impact (MBACI) design to determine the effects of application rates that are used in grasslands (1 L center dot m(-2)) and scrublands (3 L center dot m(-2)). Retardant application caused a significant increase in the trophic status of the ponds in the postcontamination period (second and third hydrological cycle) relative to the precontamination period (first hydrological cycle). The retardant clearly affected nutrients and indirectly affected chlorophyll a, pH, dissolved oxygen, and Secchi transparency, resulting in a shift from clear water to turbid water stable states. Univariate analyses showed that water quality variables showed distinct recovery trajectories, as influenced by natural, seasonal changes (chiefly water level fluctuations). Nonmetric, multidimensional scaling analyses suggest that water quality did not return to precontamination levels after two hydrological cycles in the retardant-treated ponds. Water quality affected by retardant contamination appeared to maintain wetlands in hysteresis for at least two hydrological cycles and prevented them from returning to the clear water, submerged macrophyte-dominated state.

J	Babel, M; Becker, A				Babel, Maciej; Becker, Anna			Cyclonic brine-flow pattern recorded by oriented gypsum crystals in the badenian evaporite basin of the northern Carpathian Foredeep	JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH												In the middle Miocene (Badenian), within sulfate evaporites formed in the northern Carpathian Foredeep basin of Poland, Ukraine, and the Czech Republic, the apices of the primary, bottom-grown gypsum crystals (selenites) are similarly aligned over broad areas and have a common azimuth. This crystal orientation is interpreted as the product of a consistent direction of a brine inflow during gypsum crystallization, and such a unique commonality is used as a tool for paleocurrent analysis in order to recognize both the local and the regional brine paleocurrents in the basin. Earlier sedimentologic and stratigraphic studies proved that these beds of oriented selenites were deposited at the same or nearly the same time, in a brine not more than a few meters deep. It is interpreted that the oriented selenites recorded only the mean flow within the basin, mainly from the periods of mixing (in the dry-season lowstands), when the whole brine column down to the bottom was Ca-sulfate oversaturated. The measured paleocurrent vectors showed that the brines flowed along the marginal zone of the Carpathian Foredeep basin predominantly in a counterclockwise direction. This longshore flow is interpreted as a typical cyclonic circulation analogous to those present in recent lakes and semi-closed basins in the northern hemisphere where counterclockwise mean water drift is directly or indirectly forced by Earth rotation (the Coriolis effect). The detected brine flow directions do not reflect downslope gravity flow of dense brines into the central basinal depths or subbasins that were filling with the halite facies.

J	Admassu, D; Casselman, JM				Admassu, D; Casselman, JM			Otolith age determination for adult tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus L. from Lake Awassa (Ethiopian Rift Valley) by interpreting biannuli and differentiating biannual recruitment	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Age of mature Oreochromis niloticus in Lake Awassa, Ethiopia, was estimated by analysing optical macrozones (translucent and opaque) in sagittal otoliths from fish sampled over a 12-month period. Seasonal record on the type of macrozone at the edge of otoliths suggested that two translucent macrozones associated with biannuli were formed each year; one during January and February and another during June and July. Formation of translucent macrozones coincided with minimum water temperature, spawning associated loss in condition and presumably with reduction in the quantity and quality of the food consumed by the fish. Relative marginal increment analysis showed that biannulus formation may be completed in March and in August each year. A concurrent study has confirmed a biannual recruitment in O. niloticus in Lake Awassa, from which mid-February and mid-August were taken as median hatch-dates. A procedure to assign otolith age is described which considers median hatch-dates and uses the number of biannuli in otoliths without discriminating between fish from the two recruitment cohorts. We also show a procedure to discriminate between the two cohorts by using the number of biannuli, conditions on the edge of the otolith and time of capture to assign age for the two recruitment cohorts separately.																			0018-8158					JAN	2000	418						15	24		10.1023/A:1003883419105	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003883419105													WOS:000085998100002
J	Trifonova, IS				Trifonova, IS			Phytoplankton composition and biomass structure in relation to trophic gradient in some temperate and subarctic lakes of north-western Russia and the Prebaltic	HYDROBIOLOGIA					10th Workshop of the International-Association-of-Phytoplankton-Taxonomy-and-Ecology (IAP)	JUN 21-29, 1996	GRANADA, SPAIN	Int Assoc Phytoplankton Taxon & Ecol				A comparative analysis of the phytoplankton of 27 lakes of three Lake Districts (Karelian Isthmus, Latgalian Elevation and Bolshezemelskaja Tundra), all situated at high temperate (60 and 56 degrees N) and subarctic (67-68 degrees N) latitudes with a wide range of the trophy, is presented. A direct correlation between TP content and phytoplankton biomass was observed in all three regions. As the mean annual TP concentrations range from 10 to 137 mg m(-3) the variation of average biomass for a growing season was 0.3-20 g m(-3). The total number of phytoplankton species found in individual lakes varied from 25 to 160, increasing along the trophic gradient. The largest number of phytoplankton species was found in lakes supporting mean biomass in the range 10-20 g m(-3). Taxonomic diversity decreased in some hypertrophic polluted lakes and in acidic lakes. In lakes of all regions, the number of species of chlorophyte, blue-green and euglenophyte algae increased with lake trophy. Analyses of distribution and ecology of mass species shows that in spite of the influence of latitudinal factors, such as the mineral content of lake waters the succession of dominant phytoplankton species show consistent trends: more cosmopolitan species with wide ecological amplitudes accompany the trophic gradient. Step-wise regression analyses showed that trophic factor had the greatest influence on the total phytoplankton biomass and biomass of blue-greens, chlorophytes and euglenophytes. Biomass of dinoflagellates and chrysophytes was influenced considerably more by total ionic concentration than by the trophic factor. The most important factor for diatoms was lake morphometry. Biomass of nanoplankton algae was influenced by trophic factors but also by lake depth.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1998	370						99	108		10.1023/A:1017074615932	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017074615932													WOS:000076259900009

Variability in Burbot Cohort Abundance at Juvenile and Adult Stages in Columbia Lake, British Columbia	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												This study examined changes in the abundance of juvenile (age-0 and age-1) and adult Burbot Lota lota in Columbia Lake, British Columbia, for the 1991-1999 cohorts. The objectives were to quantify the degree of variation in cohort abundance at different life stages and investigate the timing of recruitment limitation. Adult spawner abundance and age composition were monitored at a tributary spawning site from 1996 to 2001. Juvenile cohort abundance was estimated from 1997 to 1999, providing age-0 abundance indices for the 1997-1999 cohorts and age-1 indices for the 1996-1998 cohorts. The number of tributary spawners declined from about 1,500 in 1996 and 1997 to 86 in 1999 and then rebounded to 995 by 2001. Adult length frequency and age composition showed that this fluctuation reflected periodic influxes of strong cohorts that dominated the spawning population. The strongest new cohort (1999) observed at the tributary in 2001 came from the smallest number of tributary spawners. Substantial differences in the juvenile abundance of cohorts spawned from similar numbers of adults (1996, 1997) suggested a density-independent effect at the egg or larval stage. The 1999 cohort, however, was more abundant than several other cohorts at the adult stage but not at age 0, suggesting a second limiting period after the first growing season. Possible explanations for the exceptional survival of the 1999 cohort include a temporary expansion of interstitial habitat caused by unusually high water levels and low abundance of older Burbot. As large fluctuations in cohort abundance appear to be characteristic of some Burbot populations, inclusion of age composition is recommended for population assessments.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				NOV 1	2013	142	6					1705	1715		10.1080/00028487.2013.774292	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2013.774292													WOS:000327469700021

Occurrence of Conchophthirus acuminatus (Protista: Ciliophora) in Dreissena polymorpha (Mollusca: Bivalvia) along the River Shannon, Ireland	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Samples of Dreissena polymorpha were collected at several sites along the River Shannon navigation in Ireland, to determine the occurrence and distribution of their obligate host-specific commensalistic ciliate, Conchophthirus acuminatus, in this newly invaded region. Mussels collected by various methods were fixed immediately in 75% ethanol, in which they were later dissected under a stereoscopic microscope, beginning with thorough flushing of the mantle cavity and removal of the gills. One ml of sediment flushed from the mantle cavity and dissection residue of each mussel was examined under a compound light microscope using brightfield, phase-contrast, and differential-interference-contrast optics. Of 180 mussels examined, 125 (69.44%) harbored C. acuminatus. The ciliates were invariably well fixed and easily identifiable in all preparations. Mean sampling intensity for infected mussels was 8.47 ciliates per ml of sediment. Both prevalence and sampling intensity varied between sites, but no pattern was discernible. The present results are consistent with other reports of C. acuminatus being the most widespread and abundant symbiont of D. polymorpha throughout Europe, often occurring where no other symbionts occur. Its occurrence in Ireland indicates introduction of the mussels as adults, since planktonic veliger larvae are not known to harbor ciliates. Following similar reasoning, it is possible that the earlier North American invasion by D. polymorpha included only veligers, since C. acuminatus has not been found on that continent. Using these simple and quick methods, the ciliates could be easily identified and counted to give general comparative data among sites regarding intensity and prevalence. Thus, this method has promise for future efforts to obtain basic information rapidly in newly invaded systems.

To achieve fine temporal resolution of lakewide consumption, we scaled the monthly weight increments of fish during the 6-month growing season by the relative weights of the stomach contents of fish sampled around sunset. As a result, the proportion of maximum consumption varied from month to month. When this proportion was held constant, the total consumption estimates were similar but the allocation of consumption to each month differed by up to 30% between the two scenarios. Bythotrephes longimanus was the most important prey item from June to October. The average daily consumption of B. longimanus amounted to 15.4% of the standing stock, while that of daphnids Daphnia spp. and Leptodora kindtii was more than an order of magnitude lower. We conclude that adult C lavaretus in Lake Constance may control the population dynamics of B. longimanus but not those of other cladocerans.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				SEP	2002	131	5					946	955		10.1577/1548-8659(2002)131<0946:EFCBAH>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(2002)131<0946:EFCBAH>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000177740600011

Our landscape analysis revealed no relationships among plover reproductive success and 7 landscape features, 3 avian predator abundance indices, and 2 weather variables. Local nest density, earlier nest-initiation date, greater number of protection days, region, and year best explained variation in reproductive success at the lake scale. We found no beach-scale habitat variables (e.g., substrate, cobble) that differentiated successful from unsuccessful nests. Our analysis identified that high levels of nest protection have likely resulted in reproductive success being similar between the 2 regions. We believe our finding of a high level of temporal variability in piping plover reproductive success will make recovery and evaluation of piping plover management efforts difficult. We suggest that researchers and managers focus on understanding this year-to-year variability by directing future work toward understanding local movements and survival of plovers in these regions.																			2328-5540					FAL	2002	30	3					683	694																WOS:000178533300004
J	Greenwood, DR				Greenwood, DR			Eocene monsoon forests in central Australia?	AUSTRALIAN SYSTEMATIC BOTANY												The Australian Tertiary plant fossil record documents rainforests of a tropical to temperate character in south-eastern and south-western Australia for much of the Early Tertiary, and also shows the climatically mediated contraction of these rainforests in the mid to Late Tertiary. The fossil record of Australian monsoon forests, that is semi-evergreen to deciduous vine forests and woodlands of the wet-dry tropics, however, is poorly known. Phytogeographic analyses have suggested an immigrant origin for some floral elements of present day monsoon forests in northern Australia, while other elements appear to have a common history with the tropical rainforests sensu stricto and/or the sclerophyllous flora. Early Tertiary macrofloras in northern South Australia may provide some insight into the origins of Australian tropical monsoon forests. The Middle Eocene macrofloras of the Poole Creek palaeochannel, and the ?Eocene-Oligocene silcrete macrofloras of Stuart Creek, both in the vicinity of modern Lake Eyre South, have foliar physiognomic characteristics which distinguish them from both modern rainforest and Eocene-Oligocene floras from south-eastern Australia. Preliminary systematic work on these floras suggests the presence of: (1) elements not associated today with monsoon forests (principally 'rainforest' elements, e.g. Gymnostoma, cf. Lophostemon, cf. Athertonia, Podocarpaceae, ?Cunoniaceae); (2) elements typical of both monsoon forests and other tropical plant communities (e.g. cf. Eucalyptus, cf. Syzygium, and Elaeocarpaceae); (3) elements likely to be reflecting sclerophyllous communities (e.g. cf. Eucalyptus, Banksieae and other Proteaceae); and (4) elements more typically associated with, but not restricted to, monsoon forests (e.g. Brachychiton). The foliar physiognomic and floristic evidence is interpreted as indicating a mosaic of gallery or riverine rainforests, and interfluve sclerophyllous plant communities near Lake Eyre in the Early Tertiary; deciduous forest components are not clearly indicated. Palaeoclimatic analysis of the Eocene Poole Creek floras suggests that rainfall was seasonal in the Lake Eyre area in the Eocene; however, whether this seasonality reflects a monsoonal airflow is not clear.

Physical and chemical characteristics of ancient and recent reservoirs of Sri Lanka	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												This study explores the physicochemical characteristics in 51 shallow, meso-eutropic reservoirs from Sri Lanka. These reservoirs are largely dominated by sodium chloride, reflecting the dominance of precipitation in overall water chemistry. These reservoirs range in values of specific conductance from 19 to over 1000 RS cm(-1) and can be described as slightly alkaline, mesoeutrophic to eutrophic systems. The reservoirs located in five climatic regions (Arid, Dry, Intermediate, Wet, and Highland Wet zones) of Sri Lanka that vary according to patterns in precipitation, evaporation and seasonality, which are in turn, reflected in the characteristics of the regional flora and fauna. Results from this study show that the specific conductance and related variables reflect the patterns in precipitation and evapoconcentration. The highest specific conductance values are found in the Arid and Dry Zones (median values of 677 and 379 mu S cm(-1)), and are sequentially lower in the Intermediate, Wet and Highland Wet zones (median values of 237, 196, and 65 mu S cm(-1), respectively). The concentration and gradient of nutrients (total phosphorus concentration ranges from 16.6 to 664 mu g L-1 median =38.7 mu g L-1) is also an important variable, although not contribute in differentiating to different climatic zones. Finally, anoxia is a persistent problem in the hypolimnia of many reservoirs, a feature which is related to thermally and chemically stratified reservoirs.																			1863-9135					AUG	2016	188	3					249	263		10.1127/fal/2016/0920	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/fal/2016/0920													WOS:000381324600007

Larvae of the floodwater mosquito Aedes (Ochlerotatus) albifasciatus (Macquart) (Diptera: Culicidae) develop quickly in temporary pools, so intraspecific competition (for food or space) might regulate population abundance and affect the size of adult mosquitoes. We investigated the temporal variation of adult female wing-length (an index of body-size) in natural populations of Ae. albifasciatus, using adults collected during each phase of the rainy season. The relationships between adult mosquito abundance, female wing-length, rainfall and temperature were analysed through simple regressions. Skewness of the frequency distribution of wing-lengths showed a strong negative relationship with mean wing-length. The distribution of wing-lengths varied seasonally and was correlated with rainfall 7-15 days previously as the major consequence of breeding site volume. Thus temporal variation of body size in natural populations of Ae. albifasciatus reflected density-dependent changes in the aquatic habitat where immature stages develop, influenced more by rainfall than by temperature or other environmental variables.

Bythotrephes was generally most abundant at offshore stations, but mean density was patchy (4 to 1,326/m(2)) among locations. During the year, there was a shift from reproduction by mainly instar III females to reproduction by instar II females. The shift generally reflected a change in the population structure of Bythotrephes at most sites during the same period. Bythotrephes populations in July were generally characterized by small body size at reproduction (instar II and III), large clutch size, and small neonates. Later in the season, body size at reproduction and neonates were larger and clutch size was smaller. Most growth (body length) of Bythotrephes occurred between instar I and II whereas little growth occurred between instar It and III. Spine length of Bythotrephes increased between July and September. The population characteristics and reproductive strategies of Bythotrephes appear to be adaptations to fish predation and food limitations.

J	Hardy, DR				Hardy, DR			Climatic influences on streamflow and sediment flux into lake C2, northern Ellesmere Island, Canada	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Streamflow, suspended sediment transport and meteorological variables at two elevations were measured through the 1990-1992 field seasons at Lake C2 northern Ellesmere Island, as part of the Taconite Inlet Lakes Project. The objectives were to determine the extent to which suspended sediment flux responded to climatic variability, and to ascertain which meteorological variable was most strongly associated with daily discharge and sediment load. This study provided a partial test of our hypothesis that the annually-laminated sediments of Lake C2 contain a paleoclimate signal. Streamflow to the lake was almost exclusively the result of snowmelt, in response to inputs of atmospheric energy as measured by air temperature at the median watershed elevation (520 m). Sea-level air temperature, global solar and net all-wave irradiance were less clearly associated with discharge. Fluctuations of discharge and suspended sediment concentration were nearly synchronous, and non-linearly related. Daily sediment discharge was therefore linked by streamflow, with a time lag, to the energy available for snowmelt. Mean daily air temperature and cumulative degree-days above 0 degrees C, at 520 m elevation, were successfully used to predict the daily and seasonal discharge of runoff and sediment to the lake.																			0921-2728					SEP	1996	16	2					133	149																WOS:A1996VG04200003
J	Kangur, M				Kangur, Mihkel			Spatio-temporal distribution of pollen in Lake Vaike-Juusa (South Estonia) sediments	REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY												The spatio-temporal distribution of the pollen preserved in the sediments of a small closed lake was studied in order to clarify the relationships between water level fluctuations and formation of pollen profiles. Pollen analysis and AMS C-14 datings were performed on three sediment cores along a transect from the littoral zone to the lake centre. Pollen accumulation rates of dominant types of tree pollen (Picea, Pinus, Betula and Alnus) in every core were calculated for the last 6200 calibrated years and their relationships with the dynamics of morphometric parameters of lake depending on long term fluctuations in lake water level (dynamics of water depth at coring stations, dynamics of distances between the coring station and the nearest point on the lake shore, dynamics of lake area) were investigated. The results confirm that pollen accumulation rates are highest in the deepest part of the lake. Pollen distribution within the lake is species-specific and depends on the flowering season of the pollen source. Pollen originating from the trees flowering before the formation of the thermocline tends to have a higher accumulation rate in the deepest part of the lake. The pollen of trees flowering after the formation of the thermocline in the lake tends to have a higher accumulation rate in shallower water. These trends are positively correlated with water level fluctuations. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

J	Lei, RH; Jiang, ZG; Liu, BW				Lei, RH; Jiang, ZG; Liu, BW			Group pattern and social segregation in Przewalski's gazelle (Procapra przewalskii) around Qinghai Lake, China	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Group pattern and social segregation of the sexually size dimorphic Przewalski's gazelle Procapra przewalskii were studied for 7 years in the Qinghai Province, China. The main social units were: female groups; male groups; mixed groups. Mixed groups were the largest and most visible, whereas adult male groups were small and of similar size. The group size of the gazelle varied during different seasons (P < 0.002) and the type of social groups (P < 0.001). Mixed-sex groups were larger than female groups or male groups across all the seasons (P < 0.008). Adult males and females were mainly in separate groups except during the rut. Groups of adult females were the most common social unit in Przewalski's gazelle, followed in frequency by adult male groups and mixed groups. From late June to late August, social separation was most pronounced. From late October to mid-September, social segregation was not pronounced. Social segregation showed significant seasonal differences in Przewalski's gazelle (P < 0.004), especially between the rut and other seasons (P < 0.008). The pattern of social segregation of groups and behaviours observed imply that social factors play important roles in social segregation and group formation.

J	Finlay, BJ; Esteban, GF				Finlay, BJ; Esteban, GF			Planktonic ciliate species diversity as an integral component of ecosystem function in a freshwater pond	PROTIST												A diverse and dynamic community of ciliated protozoa lives in the stratified water column of the productive freshwater pond known as 'Priest pot'. As part of a long-term continuous monitoring programme, this community was examined with 10 cm-scale vertical sampling in August 1995 and June 1997, and found to be dominated by species with endosymbiotic algae (1995), or by a quite different set of species, feeding on the dinoflagellate Peridinium (1997). On both occasions, the community structure was comprehensible in terms of the preceding sequence of reciprocal interactions involving microbiological, physical and chemical factors (e.g. oxygen depletion, thermal gradient, essential nutrient concentrations). In this one pond, very different ciliate communities appear at different times, yet each community may be nothing more than a transient bi-product of dynamic ecosystem functions. The facility with which the ciliate community (or any other microbial community) transforms in a continuously changing environment probably depends on a large local diversity of rare and encysted species and the rapidity with which these species fill vacant niches.

J	ROBINSON, SK				ROBINSON, SK			HABITAT SELECTION AND FORAGING ECOLOGY OF RAPTORS IN AMAZONIAN PERU	BIOTROPICA												Census results and observations of foraging tactics and diet were compiled for the 35 regularly occurring species of diurnal raptors in an 800-ha section of the lowland Manu National Park of southeastern Peru. Census results show that most forest raptors occurred across a broad array of successional stages. Population densities ranged from a high of one or two territories per 100 ha (e.g., Micrastur forest-falcons, double-toothed kite, Harpagus bidentatus) to lows of much less than one territory in the entire study area (e.g., large eagles). A species replacement apparently occurs in the genus Leucopternis, with the slate-colored hawk L. schistacea occupying flood plain forest and the white-browed hawk L. kuhli occupying upland forest. All other congeners showed substantial overlap in habitat use. Based on observations by 35 researchers of over 400 prey items being carried and over 200 attacks, I divided raptors into several preliminary guilds. Forest raptors include seven species that hunt arthropods and small vertebrates from concealed perches (e.g., Micrastur forest-falcons, gray-headed kite, Leptodon cayanensis); seven species that hunt large birds and mammals either from concealed perches (e.g., ornate hawk-eagle, Spizaetus ornatus) or on long-range attacks on sites where birds or mammals aggregate (e.g., bicolored hawk, Accipiter bicolor); and several species with specialized diets of wasps (red-throated caracara, Daptrius americanus), snails (hook-billed kite, Chondrohierax uncinatus), and snakes (laughing falcon, Herpetotheres cachinnans). Species that hunt on the wing include four that feed mostly on flying insects and small vertebrates (two kites, the short-tailed hawk Buteo brachyurus, and the bat falcon Falco rufigularis), one that dives on perched vertebrates (zone-tailed hawk Buteo albonotatus), and two vultures that search for carrion. Raptors of open rivers, lakes, and marshes include a fish specialist (the osprey Pandion haliaetus), two snail specialist kites, a carrion-eating vulture, a Buteo that dives on arthropods and small vertebrates, and three species with extremely diverse diets (e.g., black-collared hawk, Busarellus nigricollis). Snail specialists tended to occur irregularly during the eleven field seasons of this study. Several raptors are known to influence the population dynamics of their prey species. Large forest-dwelling raptors such as the harpy and crested eagles are likely to require the largest preserves.																			0006-3606					DEC	1994	26	4					443	458		10.2307/2389239	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2389239													WOS:A1994QF43400012

The aim of the present research was to determine the economic value of the Gohar Lake resort using the zonal travel cost method. Therefore, at first, 380 questionnaires were distributed among the tourists by the simple random sampling method based on appropriate spatiotemporal distribution during the visiting seasons. The questionnaire items were categorized as economic, social, and miscellaneous parts. The calculation results revealed a value of USD 84.538 per visitor and a value of USD 1,986,657.163 per year, indicating the high value and importance of the region. The analysis showed that socio-economic variables have a significant role in the use or non-use of the resort. The obtained R2 coefficient was 0.82, indicating that around 82% of the changes in the number of visitors can be justified by the variables introduced in the model. The results also revealed the need to pay more attention to this region and formulate a tourism development plan.

J	Bernal-Brooks, FW; Rojas, AGT; Alcocer, J				Bernal-Brooks, FW; Rojas, AGT; Alcocer, J			Lake Patzcuaro (Mexico): a controversy about the ecosystem water regime approached by field references, climatic variables, and GIS	HYDROBIOLOGIA												In this paper, a basic question is asked about a well-documented case study in Mexico: how well do we know Lake Patzcuaro? We address water balance as fundamental to the question. Past studies provide ambiguous explanations about the role of either underground infiltration and/or runoff, relative to the lake-level fluctuation. Thus, our suspicions over the database reliability led us to inspect historic records on water levels and climatic variables; check out the altitude of ground references, and analyze traces of runoff watercourses over the terrestrial basin by means of GIS. By making data re-arrangement and corrections, it became evident that the lake is subject to long-term cycles with ca. 40-year peaks, including short-term seasonal cycles within. Sensitivity to climatic conditions was determined, as well as the active influence of runoff as an important hydrologic component that contributes to cause serious damage to the land surface by erosion. Rearrangement of raw data highlights the occurrence of past misinterpretations founded on biased information.					; Alcocer, Javier/S-7672-2019	Alcocer, Javier/0000-0002-0535-7936; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN	2002	467	1-3					187	197		10.1023/A:1014919032228	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1014919032228													WOS:000174759600017

Evaporation rates were combined with rainfall and fluvial income to estimate water balance. Heat and water balance were subjected to sensitivity analyses to evaluate the relative effects of variations in minimum and maximum air temperature, humidity, wind speed, cloud cover, and rainfall. Cloud cover and wind speed emerged as the most influential factors for lake temperature, evaporation, and mixing dynamics. Historical variations in ionic strength of Lake Edward surface water underscore sensitivity of the lake to climate. Major ion composition of the lake is incongruous with chemical inputs reported for streams descending from the Ruwenzoris and the highlands of southwestern Uganda. Mass balance calculations reveal that major sources of many elements are unaccounted for by present measurements, and point to the dominance of as yet unstudied stream sources entering the lake from the Virunga volcano region at the south. Based on model calculations, the chemical composition of water sources from the Virunga region is predicted a priori. Lake Edward is remarkable because despite episodic richness of biogenic Si in its sediments, diatoms are not common at present, although they are more prevalent in the south than in the north. One reason for episodic success by diatoms may be linked to changing patterns of lake mixing. Seasonal mixing dynamics of the lake were inferred from weather records and radiation flux measured from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite data. SSTs inferred from AVHRR imagery were used to test one hypothesis for the diatom distribution- namely that increased water column stability in the north and a shoaling mixed layer exaggerate the loss rates by sinking and depress the supply of nutrients from below. Variations in water balance for the lake are consistent with observations of significant changes in lake water chemistry during the 20(th) century.																			1574-0919		1-4020-0772-8				2002	12						235	260																WOS:000179074600008

A unique dataset of 22 coincident nutrient, phytoplankton, meteorological, and reservoir condition variables were recorded or calculated monthly for Hoover Reservoir near Columbus, Ohio, from February 1999 to December 2005. Network science was used in this study to visualize and differentiate selected nutrient and phytoplankton seasonality in Hoover Reservoir. Nutrient and phytoplankton concentrations in Hoover Reservoir respond independently to a number of external and internal environmental variables, but are also biochemically interdependent within the reservoir ecosystem. A number of forcing parameters can significantly alter seasonal phytoplankton growth and succession patterns. Chief among these are variability in the daily, seasonal, and/or yearly patterns and intensities of precipitation and the resultant surface runoff; duration and intensity of solar radiation; air and resultant water temperatures; and agricultural practices. The phytoplankton population in Hoover Reservoir is ecologically driven, with algal succession and nutrient levels constraining population concentrations. Complemented by selected statistical analyses, this limited network community detection study provides the hydrologist/ecologist with a dynamic and quantitative visualization of the complex hydrometeorological variable and biogeochemical process forcing parameters present in reservoirs and lakes.

However, few studies focused on the internal interaction between each species. In our research, about 4 seasons and 20 sites of biodata in 2019 were sampled in Chenghai Lake. Based on correlation analysis, the biological network was established to connect different species for analyzing internal linkages. Additionally, we selected 10 biological indicators to assess habitat quality for each sites. As the results, about 30 kinds of macrobenthic species were collected, which were classified in 7 orders and 13 families. Firstly, the oligochaete and chironomid became dominant throughout the year. Secondly, the richness of gastropoda were relative small. According to the habitat quality assessment, it was concluded that 4 areas had been disturbed possibly by exogenous pollutants. In general, the habitat quality of north was better than the south, the east was better than the west in Chenghai Lake. It was concluded that Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri and Tubifex tubifex showed significantly negative correlation in the network (- 0.682, P < 0.05), which were dominant species in the 2019 and 2009 respectively. Furthermore, another dominant species Gyraulus convexiusculus assembled some of catarobia was showed significantly positive correlation (0.776, P < 0.05). In this study, the existing studies are optimized as (a) Analyzing the current structure of benthos in Chenghai Lake; (b) Establishing the ecological network for each species and determining the core species in benthic web; (c) Assessing habitat quality comprehensively. This research will have application in habitat management and ecosystem restoration by using benthic organisms.

The role of light and oxygen in Chaoborus punctipennis (Insecta: Diptera) diel vertical migration	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Aquatic phantom midge larvae (Chaoborus punctipennis) exhibit diel vertical migration (DVM) in response to fish visual predation, remaining in deeper waters during the day and ascending nocturnally to feed. Light penetration into the water column and dissolved oxygen concentrations are hypothesized to determine the depths where larvae are found during daylight hours. We collected samples in Yellow Poplar Tree Lake in Millington, Tennessee before and after sunset during a day in March, May, July, and September of 2005. Average daytime depth (Dc) and use of daytime refugia (dark or hypoxic waters) were significantly different (P < 0.05) among larval instars (I/II < III < IV) in May, July, and September when the lake was highly stratified. Final instars utilized hypoxic waters (DO2 < 3.5 mg/L) more than III instars, while I/II instars did not use this refuge. When the lake was highly stratified, the average depth of all instars during daylight hours was below the depth of maximum light penetration (1.0 mu Einsteins/m(2)/s); IV instars remained below this level in May, July, and September, but III instars did so only in July and September, and I/II instars did so only in September. Further, IV instar Dc was significantly correlated with the critical oxygen threshold for fish (DO2=3.5 mg/L; R-2=0.783, df=11, P < 0.01) but not with maximum light penetration (R-2=0.183, df=11, P > 0.05), indicating that oxygen was the overriding stimulus governing C punctipennis DVM seasonal changes and average daytime depth.																			0270-5060					MAR	2007	22	1					101	106		10.1080/02705060.2007.9664150	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2007.9664150													WOS:000244325600012

The aim of the study was to determine how acidification influenced macroinvertebrate community structure within a relatively narrow pH range. We focused on strongly acidified, non-humic running waters with low ionic content (pH < 4.6, total organic carbon < 10 mg l(-1), specific conductivity < 100 mu S cm(-1)) and minimum human influence in the catchment. The actual pH values ranged from 3.98 to 4.65, and concentrations of reactive aluminium ranged from 0.2 to 2.0 mg l(-1). Characteristic macroinvertebrates were the stoneflies Leuctra nigra, Nemurella pictetii, and Protonemura spp.; the chironomids Corynoneura spp.; and the caddisfly Plectrocnemia conspersa - the former two stoneflies formed together 46% of total organisms. The sites were divided into three groups with use of divisive classification. Individual groups reflected similarity in water chemistry, catchment characteristics, and geographical proximity. The largest biotic difference detected by PCA was in the abundance of stoneflies, mainly Diura bicaudata and Leuctra major. The strongest correlation with this gradient was shown by pH (and associated heavy metals), followed by the distance from source. The results show that even in such narrow pH range, the number of taxa is determined by the low pH value and related high concentrations of aluminium and heavy metals.

The estimation power of the developed fuzzy logic model was tested by comparing its performance with that from the classical multiple regression model. The data include chlorophyll-a concentrations in Keban lake as a response variable, as well as several water quality variables such as PO4 phosphorus, NO3 nitrogen, alkalinity, suspended solids concentration, pH, water temperature, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen concentration and Secchi depth as independent environmental variables. Because of the complex nature of the studied water body, as well as non-significant functional relationships among the water quality variables to the chlorophyll-a concentration, an initial analysis is conducted to select the most important variables that can be used in estimating the chlorophyll-a concentrations within the studied water body. Following the outcomes from this initial analysis, the fuzzy logic model is developed to estimate the chlorophyll-a concentrations and the advantages of this new model is demonstrated in model fitting over the traditional multiple regression method.

However, most ultimately piscivorous fish pass through a period of planktivory before becoming piscivorous. In 1993 and 1994, two large cohorts of young-of-the-year largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) were recorded in Paul Lake, Michigan. The 1993 and 1994 cohorts were the largest recorded in data extending back to 1984 and occurred during a period in which adult and juvenile bass biomass was low. In 1993, consumption of large-bodied zooplankton by the young-of-the-year cohort eliminated large-bodied cladocerans by the middle of August. As large cladocerans declined, small cladocerans, especially Bosmina longirostris, increased. By early September the biomass of B. longirostris was similar to that of the entire cladoceran community in previous years. Coincident with the shifts in the cladoceran community were increases in epilimnetic Chl a concentrations <35 mu m. However, total epilimnetic chl a did not increase. In contrast, the 1994 cohort had no discernible effect on pelagic food web structure because production of large-bodied zooplankton rapidly exceeded predation. Our results show the potential for large cohorts of piscivorous fish to affect food web structure, at a seasonal scale, through intense planktivory.					; Post, David/A-6987-2009; Cottingham, Kathryn/AAV-3934-2021; Carpenter, Stephen/AAQ-6404-2020	Cottingham, Kathryn/0000-0003-3169-5047; Post, David/0000-0003-1434-7729; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				JUN	1997	42	4					722	729		10.4319/lo.1997.42.4.0722	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1997.42.4.0722													WOS:000071037700010

Instantaneous fluxes of Sigma PCB (sum of 77 congener peaks) based on air-water concentration gradients drawn from air and water samples collected simultaneously aboard ship demonstrated net volatilization in September 1991. Air samples collected the northeastern shore of Lake Michigan (Sleeping Bear Dunes State Park) between December 1991 and July 1993 showed no seasonal trend in vapor-phase Sigma PCB concentrations and ranged from 30 to 400 pg/m(3). These air concentrations were used to calculate seasonal water-air fluxes of Sigma PCB that ranged from -18 ng m(-2) day(-1) (net deposition) to 60 ng m(-2) day(-1) (net volatilization). The seasonal variation of vapor-phase and dissolved-phase PCBs in the impacted southern quarter of the lake are unknown, thereby hindering estimation of fluxes in this region.

The Arendsee Lake annual mean spectrum extended over nearly 10 decades of body size and 2.1 decades of biomass per size class (minimum, autotrophic picoplankton; maximum, colonial cyanobacteria). The spectrum was continuous (no size class without associated biomass). These data indicate that continuous PSDs are not restricted to the plankton in large pelagic zones (e.g., central oceanic systems or large freshwater lakes). We conclude that differences in the biomass of the various size classes are a consequence of eutrophic conditions in Arendsee Lake, not of littoral or benthic influences. In addition, we evaluated the impact of daphnids on the shape of the PSD with a data set comprising single samples from each of 28 lakes in northern Germany plus seasonal data from Arendsee Lake. In lakes of situations with a large Daphnia biomass (greater than or equal to 0.5 mg fresh weight liter(-1)), the slopes of the straight lines fitted to the normalized PSDs were less negative. In the 28 northern lakes, but not in Arendsee Lake, there was greater variation about the fitted line when Daphnia biomass was high, indicating a less homogenous PSD. Discontinuities in the spectra were found only in samples from the 28 northern lakes and for higher Daphnia biomass. Our interpretation is that the feeding mode of large filter-feeders results in a higher transfer efficiency from small to larger individuals (less negative slopes), which produces changes to a nonhomogenous PSD.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				SEP	1998	43	6					1119	1132		10.4319/lo.1998.43.6.1119	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1998.43.6.1119													WOS:000076791700008

It is characterized by blooms of either green or blue-green algae (often noxious smelling) and by a drastic reduction in dissolved oxygen and often makes it impossible for many species of fish and zooplankton to live in the water. The objective was to examine the effects of eutrophication on plankton seasonal dynamics. Simulation models have been used primary tool in the study of eutrophication in lakes. Many eutrophication models have been developed both to predict the effect of nutrient additions on lake biota and to examine how effective Various nutrient diversions alternatives might be improved water duality. Systems dynamics was studied using the model, which is expressed as a series of four differential equations as its state variables for the rates of change of phytoplankton, zooplankton, nitrogen and phosphorus. Influence of the phosphorus concentration on eutrophication was treated and studied as the one of the most important process in the lake ecosystem. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Evaluation of a river classification system as a conservation measure in the management of Atlantic salmon in Insular Newfoundland	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												Abstract In an effort to address the decline in abundance of Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., in insular Newfoundland rivers, resource managers introduced a River Classification System (RCS) in 1999 to assist in the management and conservation of the resource. The RCS set daily and seasonal bag limits in the recreational fishery on a river by river basis. An analysis of the catch and effort data before and after the implementation of the RCS showed an overall decline in the number of retained salmon after the implementation of the RCS, but no change in overall effort. Upon closer examination, it was found that retention increased on Class I rivers, which had the highest allowed retention, but declined on the other class rivers. On one particular river (Harry's River), which alternated classifications from 2007 to 2010, it was found that exploitation rates increased as allowed retention increased. Newfoundland salmon anglers appear to be retention anglers and therefore the RCS was an effective tool for diverting catch and effort to specific rivers by changing retention limits.																			0969-997X	1365-2400				OCT	2013	20	5					454	459		10.1111/fme.12034	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fme.12034													WOS:000324319800008

Spatiotemporal temperature changes are costly to fish in terms of subsequent thermoregulatory behavior and acclimation; therefore, thermal conditions have a heavy impact on the biological function of fishes. Spatiotemporal variation and stability of water temperatures along cross-shore transects in the littoral zone (within 100 m from shore) were monitored and compared on two lakeshores with different cross-shore depth profiles. One shore was associated with a retaining wall and a relatively deep, flat bottom (steep shore), whereas the other extended offshore at a gentle gradient (gentle shore). Water temperature was more spatially variable on the gentle shore than the steep shore [1.44 +/- A 0.47 and 0.20 +/- A 0.14A degrees C (mean +/- A SD), respectively], but a stable temperature range (i.e., the range of temperatures continuously observed on each shore for 48 h) was maintained only on the gentle shore during seasonal temperature decline. These results suggest that gentle shores have higher potential to provide a wider range of thermal options, allowing fish to fine-tune thermoregulatory behavior and acclimate more efficiently to temperature changes.

The community composition varied greatly with depth. Oligotrichs dominated in the epilimnion, where prostomatids and peritrichs were also important components of the community. The density of oligotrichs and peritrichs decreased in the metalimnion, and they were absent from the hypolimnion. In the deep metalimnion the most abundant groups were prostomatids, haptorids and scuticociliates. In the hypolimnion, the ciliate community was dominated by scuticociliates and heterotrichs. In the epilimnion and metalimnion a significant positive correlation was observed between ciliate numbers, chlorophyll a and heterotrophic flagellate density. In all three zones the number of ciliates was most strongly correlated with water temperature, concentrations of total organic carbon (TOC), total phosphorus (P-tot) and bacterial density, whilst in the hypolimnion there was a significant correlation between ciliate numbers and the dissolved oxygen concentration.

Lake Kernaala, Finland. In May, the majority of RCs in liver were seen in blood vessel endothelium, while in August most cells were located in the epithelium of the intrahepatic biliary ducts. In kidney, a significant increase in RCs in the columnar epithelium of the collecting ducts was observed from May to August. RCs in spleen were extremely rare in May but were seen frequently in the endothelium of the splenic blood vessels in August. In gill and intestine, RCs were found in every tissue sample studied, with no statistical differences in their abundance or distribution between seasons. No RCs were seen in gonads. Total numbers of RCs increased dramatically from May to August in kidney and in spleen. The frequency of RCs corresponded strongly with the current phase of parasitic infections in liver, kidney, and spleen. It is concluded that RCs play a rule in host defence mechanisms in fish, displaying induced expression at the times of peak parasitic prevalences.

Measurements of water temperature, euphotic zone, suspended material, electrical conductivity, total alkalinity, pH, dissolved oxygen, carbon dioxide, total nitrogen, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, total phosphorus, dissolved phosphorus, reactive soluble phosphorus and chlorophyll a were taken monthly between March 1993 and February 1994. Results lend evidence to the importance of the hydrological regime on the dynamic of limnological variables in floodplain takes. A dilution of nutrients in the lagoon, especially phosphates, occurred during floods. This was followed by fertilization of the environment by nutrients from the inundated marginal regions. During low connectivity periods, autochthonous, events such as ressuspension of sediment, brought on by wind and rain, governed limnological events in the lagoon.

The stormwater runoff hydrograph was simulated by developing a conceptual hybrid model (HM) using transfer function. Model parameters were estimated by non-linear optimization. The simulated runoff hydrographs showed an excellent match with the observed data. Next, a relationship was developed between runoff and pollutant load and the developed relationship was used for estimation of pollutant load. A novelty of this hybrid approach is that it could bring out a generic HM. By using the derived model, the pollutant load was successfully predicted from simulated runoff (R-2 > 0.75) by considering rainfall as the only input. In addition, assessment, characterization and analysis of the first flush of urban runoff also form part of the study. The HM was tested and validated by applying it to 25 storm events monitored during two monsoon seasons in the Nainital Lake catchment (approx. 1900 m a.m.s.l.), India.					; Jain, Sharad/GPW-9877-2022	Jain, Sharad/0000-0002-6268-2145; 													0262-6667	2150-3435				NOV 17	2020	65	15					2535	2547		10.1080/02626667.2020.1821034	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2020.1821034		OCT 2020											WOS:000578822700001

However, climate change is a threat to agriculture in many parts of Nigeria especially the north-eastern part where the Lake Chad basin is a prominent victim. Yet, the Lake Chad basin is crucial to food security in Nigeria as most of the grains are grown there. Thus, prudent management of water resources and agricultural planning is required to ensure the sustainability of crop production in the basin. This study applied the Thornthwaite water balance model to compute the water balance of select crops in the basin to devise a better farming practice based on the findings. The study period was divided into two, the base period (1945-1979) and the second period (period of change 1980-2014). The findings show that there is a significant change or variability in climate between the two periods. However, the change is higher in Nguru which may be due to its higher latitudinal location and the desert encroachment due to poor land-use management. However, with the proposed bi-annual cropping of the select crops, it is possible to have double seasons of planting in the study area. The first season will be from May-September and the second from October-February. Since the water need of these crops is not so demanding, the crops can be grown twice with prudent water management via rainwater harvesting and minimal groundwater withdrawal. Further studies are suggested to work out the irrigation schedule for the different crops to minimise waste and losses due to over-irrigation. Hence, it is recommended that improved seed crops with very short growing cycle and/or drought-tolerant species as well as developing all-year-round planning is a panacea to human and environmental concerns in the basin.

J	Rebêlo, GH; Lugli, L				Rebêlo, GH; Lugli, L			Distribution and abundance of four caiman species (Crocodylia: Alligatoridae) in Jau National Park, Amazonas, Brazil	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												Jab National Park is a large rain forest reserve that contains small populations of four catman species. We sampled crocodilian populations during 30 surveys over a period of four years in five study areas. We found the mean abundance of caiman species to be very low (1.0 +/- 0.5 caiman/km of shoreline), independent of habitat type (river, stream or lake) and season. While abundance was almost equal, the species' composition varied in different waterbody and study areas, We analysed the structure similarity of this assemblage. Lake and river habitats were the most similar habitats, and inhabited by at least two species, mainly Caiman crocodilus and Melanosuchus niger However, those species can also inhabit streams. Streams were the most dissimilar habitats studied and also had two other species: Paleosuchus trigonatus and P. palpebrosus. The structure of these assemblage does not suggest a pattern of species associated and separated by habitat. Trends in species relationships had a negative correlation with species of similar size, C. crocodilus and P trigonatus, and an apparent complete exclusion of M. niger and P trigonatus. Microhabitat analysis suggests a slender habitat partitioning, P trigonatus was absent from river and lake Igapo (flooded forest), but frequent in stream Igapo, This species was the most terrestrial and found in microhabitats similar to C crocodilus (shallow waters. slow current). Melanosuchus niger inhabits deep, fast moving waters in different study areas. Despite inhabiting the same waterbodies in many surveys, M. niger and C. crocodilus dirt not share the same microhabitats. Paleosuchus palpebrosus was observed only in running waters and never in stagnant lake habitats. Cluster analysis revealed three survey groups: two constitute a mosaic in floodplains, (a) a cluster with both M. niger and C. crocodilus. and another (b) with only C. crocodilus, A third cluster (c) included more species, and the presence of Paleosuchus species, There was no significant difference among wariness of caimans between disturbed and undisturbed localities, However. there was a clear trend to increase wariness during the course of consecutive surveys at four localities, suggesting that we, more than local inhabitants, had disturbed caimans, The factors that are limiting caiman populations can be independent of human exploitation. Currently in Amazonia, increased the pressure of hunting. habitat loss and habitat alteration, and there is no evidence of widespread recovery of caiman populations In large reserves as Jab without many disturbance, most caiman populations can be low density, suggesting that in blackwater environments their recovery from exploitation should be very slow.

In Kasseb reservoir, the zooplankton community was dominated by Acanthocyclops sp. (37.3% of total zooplankton density) and Bosmina longirostris (32.6% of total zooplankton density). In Mornaguia and Ghdir El Goulla, Copidodiaptomus numidicus was the most abundant species with 62.1% and 97.5% of total zooplankton density respectively. Our study indicated that the zooplankton community of Ghdir El Goulla reservoir was influenced by the impact of internal environmental factors and artificially introduced water from the two Kasseb and Mornaguia reservoirs. Highest density of zooplankton species was recorded in Kasseb reservoir, which indicated an increased tendency for eutrophication. Mornaguia and Ghdir El Goulla are oligo-mesotrophic reservoirs. Understanding the relationship between the zooplankton community and temporal distribution is important for the understanding of trophic interactions within these reservoirs.																			0003-4088						2009	45	2					107	117		10.1051/limn/2009008	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/2009008													WOS:000268325200005

We hypothesized that the dredging activities affected the zooplankton communities and the hydrochemical conditions of the studied lakes. Significant differences in zooplankton abundance were found. The analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) revealed that plankton communities were different between lakes and that the microcrustaceans largely contributed to the average dissimilarity. In particular, the lower densities of cladocerans and the presence of large-size species in the lake still under dredging during this study appeared to be related to the resuspension of sand in the water column. We report how the zooplankton communities evolved toward an higher taxonomical and functional diversity after conclusion of the dredging activities.

Initially red coloured, poorly-sorted, angular cobble to pebble conglomerates were deposited close to the boundary faults. These conglomerates then passed into the finer-grained, calcite-cemented pebble to granule conglomerates towards the basin interior. The distributions of other lacustrine lithofacies (siltstone/claystone, marlstone, limestone and magnesite) appear to have been dependent on the proximity of the lake margins. These occurrences show that the basin was subject to some climatic and tectonic controls. Humid seasons and/or tectonic activities resulted in increased clastic input from the lake margins, drier conditions enhanced evaporation and significantly modified the water chemistry. Ultramafic and dolomitic older rocks around the basin are considered to have been an important source for the ion concentrations implicated in the precipitation of dolomite and magnesite in the Hoyran Lake deposits.					; Gül, Murat/M-6610-2019; TOPAK, YUSUF/B-2606-2019	Roses, Murat/0000-0003-0215-6343; 													0001-5709	2300-1887					2009	59	2					245	259																WOS:000269082900007

The water bodies store comparable volumes but the eutrophic Lake Arancio may be considered to be a shallow lake whereas the mesotrophic Lake Rosamarina is deep. The dynamics of their principal physical, chemical and biological features were analysed using, among others, Canonical Community Ordination. The results obtained suggest that increased nutrient availability causes an increase of phytoplankton biomass but no community change nor any alteration to the typical assemblages supported. The major influence in the more eutrophic lake was exerted by physical variates and, in particular, by the underwater light climate regime, whereas a significant influence of nutrients was observed in the mesotrophic one. Moreover, an assemblage of species able to regulate their buoyancy, or adapted to frequent dark/light cycles was characteristic of the eutrophic lake. We hypothesize that the physical characteristics of a water body and secondary modifications induced by increased nutrient availability, e.g. higher phytoplankton biomass, contraction of the euphotic depth, selective grazing, may drive the seasonal succession of phytoplankton in the upper part of the trophic spectrum.

Field measurements of total particulate organic carbon (POC), particulate organic nitrogen (PON) and particulate phosphorus (PP) show that the large autochtonous production of organic matter strongly affects the carbon and nutrient budget of the aquatic system. During the growing season, phytoplankton accounts for nearly 60% of the POC and dominates the PON. Calculations of the carbon and oxygen budget in the upper reach of the Belgian Meuse demonstrates that the ecosystem is autotrophic, i.e. that autochtonous FPOM (fine particulate organic matter) production is the major carbon input. This suggests that in large lowland rivers, primary production (P) may exceed community respiration (R), i.e. P:R>1, whereas they are assumed to be heterotrophic (P:R<1) in the River Continuum concept. The question of maintenance of phytoplankton in turbid mixed water columns is also addressed, and the case of the River Meuse is treated on the basis of studies of photosynthesis and respiration (ETS measurements). The results suggest that the potamoplankton may show some low-light acclimation, through an increase of chlorophyll a relative to biomass, when it comes to deep downstream reaches, and that algal respiration rate may be reduced. A simulation of the longitudinal development of the algal biomass shows the different phases of algal growth and decline along the river and brings support to the 'importation hypothesis' for explaining maintenance of potamoplankton in the downstream reaches.

In 1980 the external phosphorus loading (1.8 g TP m(-2) a(-1)) decreased by 90%, but water quality did not improve significantly within the following 6 years. In 1985 biomanipulation was initiated, with manual removal of cyprinid fish coupled with piscivore introductions as the principal measures. The expected changes in the pelagic community and improvements of water quality occurred after a delay of several years. Despite intensive manual removal of cyprinids and stocking of piscivores, standing stocks of cyprinid fish remained relatively high (130-260 kg ww ha(-1)) after some years of decline. Compared to the pre-biomanipulation period, mean seasonal (May-September) Daphnia spp. biomass roughly doubled (0.037 C m(-3) vs. 0.084 g C m(-3)). However, the predominance of small (< 1 mm) D. cucullata throughout the whole investigation period indicated that planktivory was still substantial. Paired observations between edible phytoplankton biomass and Daphnia spp. indicated that a significant decline in algal stocks would only occur if herbivorous biomass was above a certain threshold (0.2 g C m(-3)). Reduced external and internal loading in concert with pelagic calcite precipitation were most likely responsible for the decline in lake phosphorus concentrations, thereby Substantially improving the water quality of Feldberger Haussee. Although this is not supported by quantitative evidence, we hypothesize that resource-related water quality improvements were caused by changes in the structure of the pelagic community leading to increased calcite precipitation. In agreement with the results of other investigations, we conclude that because stabilising mechanisms such as macrophyte growth were lacking in Feldberger Haussee, biomanipulation in stratified lakes may not be as successful as has been observed in shallow lakes. However, in hard-water lakes, calcite precipitation may act as another stabilising resource-related mechanism. Phosphorus associated with sedimenting calcite particles is insensitive to redox-conditions and may therefore not be re-mobilised from lake sediments even if hypolimnetic oxygen is depleted.

J	Loope, WL; Anderton, JB				Loope, WL; Anderton, JB			Human vs. lightning ignition of presettlement surface fires in coastal pine forests of the upper Great Lakes	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												To recover direct evidence of surface fires before European settlement, we sectioned fire-scarred logging-era stumps and trees in 39 small, physically isolated sand patches along the Great Lakes coast of northern Michigan and northern Wisconsin. While much information was lost to postharvest file and stump deterioration, 147 fire-free intervals revealed in cross-sections from 29 coastal sand patches document numerous close interval surface fires before 1910; only one post-1910 fire was documented. Cross-sections from the 10 patches with records spanning >150 vr suggest local fire occurrence rates before 1910 ca. 10 times the present rate of lightning-caused fire. Since fire spread between or into coastal sand patches is rare, and seasonal use of the patches by Native people before 1910 is well documented, both historically and ethnographically, ignition by humans probably accounts for more than half of the pre-1910 fires recorded in cross-sections.																			0003-0031					OCT	1998	140	2					206	218		10.1674/0003-0031(1998)140[0206:HVLIOP]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1674/0003-0031(1998)140[0206:HVLIOP]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000076836500002

Initial six-year expansion of an introduced piscivorous fish in a tropical Central American lake	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Two populations of the piscivorous fish Gobiomorus dormitor (the 'guabina') were examined in two separate crater lakes in Nicaragua, Central America. At Lake Apoyo, G. dormitor were introduced in May 1991 by local fishermen and have invaded successfully; at Lake Xiloa, the population is naturally occurring. To provide baseline life history data for G. dormitor in both lakes and to test hypotheses related to population growth and invasion success, this study aimed to (1) document and define the population growth and depth distribution of the fish through video transects in Lake Apoyo; (2) compare diet composition between lakes; and (3) compare life history parameters between lakes, including relative growth rates and reproduction. Videotaped transect studies, designed originally to examine cichlid breeding, began in both lakes in 1990 and have documented the subsequent increase of G. dormitor. Yearly means generally fit the exponential growth model. G. dormitor foraged mainly in shallow waters in Lake Apoyo and preyed mostly upon the atherinid Melaniris cf. sardina throughout seasons. In Lake Xiloa, cichlid fry constituted the majority of the diet overall and cannibalism was more common, although this trend varied with the cichlid breeding season. Relative growth rates were significantly different, based on otolith mass regressions on standard length. Lake Apoyo G. dormitor generally behaved as a successful invading species, displaying exponential growth, year-round reproduction, and higher foraging success than the natural population of Lake Xiloa. Further research is planned to explore the G. dormitor invasion when the population becomes integrated into the community.

J	Martin, AJ; McNee, JJ; Pedersen, TF				Martin, AJ; McNee, JJ; Pedersen, TF			The reactivity of sediments impacted by metal-mining in Lago Junin, Peru	JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION												The post-depositional reactivity of lake sediments impacted by metal-mining was assessed in Lago Junin, Peru. Due to mining-derived inputs of acid rock drainage, tailings and tailings pond overflow, the sediments exhibit widespread enrichments of copper, lead and zinc. High resolution profiles of dissolved (<0.45 mum) Fe, Mn, SO42- and H2S across the sediment-water interface illustrate that the organic-rich deposits (20-25 wt% organic carbon) in the main basin become anoxic within several millimetres of the lake bottom. These S-rich deposits (similar to2.5 wt%) in the deeper and permanently submerged main basin serve as a sink for Zn, Cu and Pb. Profiles of dissolved Cu, Zn and Pb in pore waters show rapid declines in metal concentration at depths consistent with zones of sulphate reduction, suggesting these metals are sequestered as metal-sulphide phases. Zinc, and to a minor degree Ni, are remobilized at the sediment-water interface, probably from decaying organic matter that has settled through the contaminated water column. Conversely, the periodically unsaturated, sulphur-rich (2-4 wt% S) deposits in shallow areas are characterized by the remobilization of copper and zinc in deep acidic (pH < 4) pore waters, resulting in the release of these metals to the overlying water column. The acid-generating properties stem from sulphide oxidation reactions that are accelerated by periodic wetting and drying episodes associated with the annual cycle of lake drawdown and recharge. The contrasts between the two regions of the lake emphasize the importance of maintaining permanent water covers should submerged storage be chosen as a disposal option for sulphide-bearing mining waste.

J	Persson, G				Persson, G			Phosphorus in tributaries to Lake Malaren, Sweden: Analytical fractions, anthropogenic contribution and bioavailability	AMBIO												Riverine phosphorus (P) concentration and P-transport to Lake Malaren, the third largest lake in Sweden, has been monitored for 35 years in 12 major tributaries. During a period of 15 months, complementary assessments of particulate P, suspended matter and dissolved reactive P were made. Particulate P comprised 64%, dissolved unreactive P 23% and dissolved reactive P 13% as flow-weighted means, with high seasonal variability. "Background" or "reference" P-transports in the streams were estimated by different methods and the anthropogenic contribution to transport was shown to be reduced over time. Potential algal availability of particulate P showed a mean availability of c. 45% for water draining arable and forested land, while the availability was higher for sewage discharge particulate P and algal P. Calculated total bioavailable P in tributaries was shown to equal reactive P measured on coarsely filtered water and it was indicated that the proportion of bioavailable P was higher during the period with high anthropogenic P-contribution than with a lower contribution.																			0044-7447	1654-7209				DEC	2001	30	8					486	495		10.1639/0044-7447(2001)030[0486:PITTLM]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1639/0044-7447(2001)030[0486:PITTLM]2.0.CO;2								11878022					WOS:000173812700004
J	Maehata, M				Maehata, Masayoshi			Reproductive ecology of the Far Eastern catfish, Silurus asotus (Siluridae), with a comparison to its two congeners in Lake Biwa, Japan	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Spawning activity of the catfish, Silurus asotus, takes place in temporary water (rice fields) from early evening to midnight, generally in connection with rainfall, from late April to late August. Spawning of the catfish was correlated with hydrographic parameters dependent on rainfall: daily precipitation, turbidity, water depth, and water temperature. The spawning habits of the catfish, and in particular the use of temporary waters such as rice fields that become submerged after rainfall or by irrigation, are presumed to be adaptations to the Asian monsoon climate with a pronounced rainy season. The apparent sex ratio of the catfish was extremely biased toward females. Intraspecific variation in the reproductive ecology, particularly mating behavior, of this species is observed among local populations. Factors that may have caused this variation are discussed in the context of a comparison of mating behavior, reproductive environment, and sex ratio between the Lake Biwa population of S. asotus and other conspecific populations, as well as two other species of silurid catfish that occur in the Lake Biwa drainage, S. biwaensis and S. lithophilus.																			0378-1909					FEB	2007	78	2					135	146		10.1007/s10641-006-9083-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-006-9083-7													WOS:000243396600005

Various viral pathogens are ordinarily associated with waterborne diseases. Six-year-surveillance (a total of 20 times) of norovirus, hepatitis A virus, group C rotavirus, and enterovirus was conducted at five raw water sampling sites including two lakes (Lakes Soyang and Juam), Hyundo region of Geum River in Daejeon City, and Guui region of Han River in Seoul Metropolitan City and Moolgeum region of Nakdong River in Gimhae City which are located near two water intake plants. In this study, we routinely investigated virus contamination in water samples through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and integrated cell culture RT-PCR with high sensitivity and specificity. A total 100 samples were tested. Most of the targeted viruses were found in 32% of the samples and at least one of the indicator bacteria was detected in 65% of these occurrences. Among all the detected viruses, enterovirus was the most prevalent with a detection frequency of 12% and 2.71 MPN/10 L on average, while hepatitis A virus was the least prevalent with a detection frequency of 4%.

J	Yehdegho, B; Rozanski, K; Zojer, H; Stichler, W				Yehdegho, B; Rozanski, K; Zojer, H; Stichler, W			Interaction of dredging lakes with the adjacent groundwater field: An isotope study	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The paper presents the results of a study aimed at determining the water balance of small dredging lakes located in the temperate climatic zone (southern Austria) and their impact on the adjacent groundwater field using heavy stable isotopes of water, deuterium and oxygen-18. The isotope method of determining water balance of groundwater-controlled lakes was examined in some detail using the field data collected during this study. The calculations performed for different sets of input data revealed that the approach recommended in the literature, i.e. the use of oxygen-18 data, the air-based temperatures and the mean isotopic composition of evaporation flux calculated from the annual mean isotopic composition of precipitation assuming isotope equilibrium at the ground-level temperature, may lead to groundwater inflow rates which are underestimated by as much as 40%, The isotope-mass balance calculations performed independently for deuterium and oxygen-18 data can be reconciled within the overall uncertainty of the method, when the surface water temperature of a lake (with relative humidity adjusted accordingly) is used instead of ground-level air temperature, and the isotopic composition of the evaporation flux is adequately averaged, taking into account the seasonal variability of this flux for the given lake system. The sensitivity analysis of the isotope-mass balance calculations performed for the studied lake system suggests that the critical parameter for the overall accuracy of the method is the isotopic composition of the lake water and, to a lesser extent, of the subsurface inflow, in cases where the isotope enrichment of lake water is relatively small. In the studied case this enrichment reached only about 20% of the isotopic composition of the input. In general, the use of isotope-mass balance for determining subsurface inflow and outflow rates to dredging lakes would require a rather extensive monitoring of isotope and hydrological parameters of the studied system, performed on a monthly basis for at least one full hydrological year. The isotope and geochemical data gathered in the present study were used to derive mixing proportions of lake water with the downgradient groundwater field. The plume of the lake water could be traced up to about 4 km from the lakes, along the general direction of groundwater flow.

J	Yoshida, T				Yoshida, T			Toward the understanding of complex population dynamics: planktonic community as a model system	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH												Ecologists have long been interested in understanding population dynamics in nature. Although theoretical ecologists have shown that mathematical models can represent various dynamic behaviors, and empirical ecologists have confirmed that some types of dynamics actually exist in nature, we do not yet completely understand how population dynamics are driven. The list of possible mechanisms driving population dynamics is still growing. Here I review studies of population dynamics carried out both in the field and in the laboratory by my colleagues and myself. I first describe some population dynamics of planktonic organisms living in freshwater lakes, then introduce some mechanisms driving population dynamics, for which theoretical and empirical evidence has only recently begun to accumulate. I also discuss how and why laboratory microcosms are a useful tool in the study of population dynamics. Future challenges to the advance of our understandings of complex population dynamics in nature lie where three different approaches intersect: time-series data description, mathematical modeling, and laboratory and field experiments.

The 1979 photograph was panchromatic. The later photography was natural color. Digitally-scanned photographs were: (1) classified using image processing software into the categories of macrophytes present or macrophytes absent (i.e. water); (2) compared across years to measure the rates and patterns of macrophyte development; and (3) compared to measures of water depth, sediment slope steepness, aspect, and fetch to relate patterns of macrophyte development to physical factors. The area occupied by floating-leaved macrophytes increased from 3.2 ha in 1979 to 19.9 ha in 1992, when macrophytes occupied 84.18 of the area 12 m deep and 56.3% of the area 3 m deep. The rates of macrophyte development were consistently slower in areas of greater water depth and greater fetch. The effects of slope and aspect were less than those for depth and fetch. Greater slopes initially enhanced but later slowed macrophyte development. Rates of development were greater for aspects facing the sun. The rate of macrophyte development was not correlated with proximity to existing vegetation. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Jansen, A				Jansen, A			Terrestrial invertebrate community structure as an indicator of the success of a tropical rainforest restoration project	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Rainforest restoration is a relatively new endeavor, and few attempts have been made to assess the success of such restoration efforts in terms of the reestablishment of an ecosystem. Small plantings of rainforest tree species have been carried out adjacent to mature rainforest at Lake Barrine National Park in North Queensland, Australia, since 1988. The aim of this project was to assess the leaf lifter invertebrate fauna of these plantings as indicators of the success of the restoration process. Plots planted in 1988, 1989, and 1990, as well as adjacent mature rainforest, were sampled in the wet and dry seasons of 1994. Invertebrates were extracted from leaf litter samples with Berlese Funnels and sorted to order. Diversity, the abundance of different size classes and orders of invertebrates, and the abundance of different functional groups were examined. In most respects the 1988 plot was found to differ little from the mature rainforest plots, whereas the 1990 plot lacked small and predatory invertebrates, especially in the dry season. The 1989 plot was intermediate in invertebrate abundance and diversity. The use of partially deciduous trees in the 1989 and 1990 plots, resulting in lower canopy cover at the driest time of the year, may have contributed significantly to the differences found between the early and later plantings. It is recommended that trees that provide good canopy cover year-round be used as dominant species in plantings to facilitate the development of a leaf litter ecosystem that can be sustained throughout the year.																			1061-2971					JUN	1997	5	2					115	124		10.1046/j.1526-100X.1997.09714.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1526-100X.1997.09714.x													WOS:A1997XJ31000003

Results from the water columns of some eutrophic and oligotrophic lakes are presented and compared to small acid lakes. Cu is strongly complexed by organic ligands which with very high stability constants at low concentrations are probably biologically produced, as indicated by the seasonal variations in the eutrophic lakes and by the relationship between Cu complexation and algal activity in the eutrophic (pCu=15-16), oligotrophic (pCu=13-14) and acidic (pCu=9-10) lakes. The extent of Cu complexation in river waters was generally lower than in the eutrophic lakes, at similar DOC levels. No obvious correlation between Cu complexation and DOC was observed, indicating that Cu complexing ligands are specific organic compounds.					; Sigg, Laura/AAI-3504-2020	Sigg, Laura/0000-0002-2210-2951; 													1015-1621						1996	58	1					69	87		10.1007/BF00877641	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00877641													WOS:A1996UL21200006

Variation in Lake Michigan Alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) Thiaminase and Fatty Acids Composition	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Thiaminase activity of alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) is variable across Lake Michigan, yet factors that contribute to the variability in alewife thiaminase activity are unknown. The fatty acid content of Lake Michigan alewife has not been previously reported. Analysis of 53 Lake Michigan alewives found a positive correlation between thiaminase activity and the following fatty acid: C22:1n9, sum of omega-6 fatty acids (Sw6), and sum of the polyunsaturated fatty acids. Thiaminase activity was negatively correlated with C15:0, C16:0, C17:0, C18:0, C20:0, C22:0, C24:0, C18:1n9t, C20:30, C22:2, and the sum of all saturated fatty acids (SAFA). Multi-variant regression analysis resulted in three variables (C18: 1n9t, Sw6, SAFA) that explained 71% (R(2)=0.71, P<0.0001) of the variation in thiaminase activity. Because the fatty acid content of an organism is related is food source, diet may be an important factor modulating alewife thiaminase activity. These data suggest there is an association between fatty acids and thiaminase activity in Lake Michigan alewife.

Crusts cover about 50% of the surface area; upland crusts cover 80% of the dunes, aquatic remnant crusts cover about 20% of the pans. The biomass of the crusts is about twice the maximum reported elsewhere. As typical for cryptobiotic crust communities, the cyanophyte Microcoleus vaginatus dominated the upland crusts; however, neither mossnor lichen-dominated crusts were found. The pans present an enigma; some were dominated by cyanobacterial crusts-, while others were dominated by bacterial crusts.

A series of studies were carried out over the year-long study to collect bacterial growth and organic carbon biodegradation data for waters from six treatment options, including the raw source water. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations were made to determine the effects of filter media type, direct Filtration, preozonation, and primary chlorination on the relative biostability of the produced waters compared to that of the original source water and water currently being distributed to consumers. In addition, results were compared to those obtained using traditional biodegradable organic material measuring methods such as assimilable organic carbon and biodegradable organic carbon. Quantitative biostability factors were developed that take into account both biological growth potential and biodegradability of the tested waters. Results from these studies were used to compare various piloted treatment processes and to assess pilot plant operation, design parameters, and seasonal source water quality.					; Schneider, Orren/L-3054-2019	Schneider, Orren/0000-0002-2705-7184; 													0733-9372					MAY	2001	127	5					403	410		10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9372(2001)127:5(403)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9372(2001)127:5(403)													WOS:000168340300004

The main objective of the present study was to describe the prevalence, abundance, and intensity of M. salmoides metazoan parasites, and their association with fish condition factor and gender. The sample size was composed by 672 hosts, collected between 2011-2013 from the following reservoirs of Nuevo Leon, Mexico: Rodrigo Gomez dam ("La Boca", LB), Cuchillo-Solidaridad dam (CS), Salinillas lagoon (LS), Mariano Escobedo dam ("Sombreretillo", S), and Jose Lopez Portillo dam ("Cerro Prieto", CP). Living fish were transported to the laboratory; sizes and weights were then recorded to calculate the Fulton condition factor (k). If possible, gender was also recorded. Parasites were detected under stereoscopy, recollected and preserved by traditional techniques. Statistical analysis of association between parasitic load, gender, and Fulton condition factor were calculated, using the X-2 and the Student-t tests. Results showed that 12 different metazoans were identified, two flukes (Posthodiplostomum minimum centrarchi and Phyllodistomum pearsei), one tapeworm (Proteocephalus ambloplitis), three roundworms (Contracaecum sp., Spinitectus carolini and Philometra nodulosa), two acantocephalan (Neoechinorhynchus cylindratus and Arhythmorhynchus sp.), one leech (Myzobdella moorei), and three copepods (Ergasilus versicolor; Ergasilus arthrosis and Ergasilus cerastes). HSD Tukey test showed that infected fish from LB were significantly different than LS, CS, CP, and S (P<0.05). Parasites most commonly collected in all five locations were P. m. centrarchi, Contracaecum sp. and E. versicolor. The frequency of P. m. centrarchi was highly significant (P<0.001) than other parasites; furthermore, this parasite showed the highest prevalence (97.5 %), abundance (10.12-83.6), and intensity (15.44-88.5). Statistical dependence was found between intensity and abundance of metazoans with regard to female gender and size on five reservoirs (t=143.82, P=0.0001; t=2.6, P=0.01, respectively). In addition, the abundance and intensity showed statistical dependence with regard to k, which was proportionally significant. New locality records for Nuevo Leon include P. m. centrarchi, P. pearsei, P. ambloplitis, Contracaecum sp., Arhythmorhynchus sp., and E. cerastes. Furthermore, P. nodulosa, S. carolini, N. cylindratus, and E. arthrosis were new records for Mexico.

Brood Parasitism of a Bagrid Catfish (Bagrus rneridionalis) by a Clariid Catfish (Bathyclarias nyasensis) in Lake Malawi, Africa	COPEIA												Bagrus meridionalis (Bagridae; locally called Kampango) Is a large substrate-spawning catfish endemic to Lake Malawi that exhibits bi-parental care and spawns primarily In the wet season from January to March. The female feeds her young trophic (unfertilized) eggs; the male orally collects offsite benthic organisms, which he brings back to feed the brood. While doing underwater videography In the lake, we observed evidence for brood parasitism of four Kampango nests by the most common clariid catfish In Lake Malawi, the endemic Bathyclarias nyasensis (locally called Bombe). Parasitized Kampango nests held Bombe young almost exclusively, and these were protected by Kampango adults until they exceeded 100 mm SL. We found that female and male Kampango fed the Bombe juveniles with trophic eggs and macroinvertebrates, respectively, as they do their own young. These observations represent a sophisticated example of cuckoo behavior In fishes.

J	Smith, KL; Jones, ML				Smith, Katherine L.; Jones, Michael L.			When are historical data sufficient for making watershed-level stream fish management and conservation decisions?	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Addressing landscape-level threats to stream fishes such as habitat and hydrological alterations requires adequate watershed-level species inventories. Where watershed-level ichthyofaunal surveys are prohibitively expensive, existing (historical) data sources may provide an option for compiling species lists. However, it is critical that managers consider potential biases or limitations of species lists compiled from existing data. Here we assess the suitability of species lists compiled from existing data sources for making watershed-level fish management and conservation decisions. For nine Great Lakes watersheds, we developed existing species lists by compiling all available federal and state agency and museum fish survey data. We then compared the size and species composition of existing species lists to current species lists compiled from intensive field surveys, conducted in 2002, of the same watersheds. Species lists compiled from commonly available existing data sources, such as state and federal agency and museum data, missed many species detected during our 2002 field surveys. In most watersheds, more than 10 species were missed (range 5-21) on existing lists. Sampling over multiple years and seasons increased the size of both current (field) and existing species lists. Existing species lists compiled from surveys conducted over multiple years and seasons included an average of 15 species not captured during the 2002 field surveys. However, such multiyear existing datasets are rare and not available for many watersheds. In addition, species lists compiled from older existing surveys (e.g., before 1984) did not accurately represent current species composition of the watersheds and our results indicate several apparent misidentifications or errors on these lists. Lastly, while most game species were detected on existing lists, migratory species and recently introduced species were commonly missed on these lists. We conclude with recommendations for using existing data for watershed-level stream fish management and conservation decisions.																			0167-6369					DEC	2007	135	1-3					291	311		10.1007/s10661-007-9650-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-007-9650-1								17375272					WOS:000250839800026

These duricrusts, occurring close to the land surface, were examined in the field as well as in the laboratory, with the objective of establishing their composition and formation. Micromorphological examinations showed that the duricrusts were composed of clasts of fine sand to fine gravel sizes cemented together by a matrix dominated by either palygorskite or carbonate. The matrix : clasts ratio varied from about 1 : 3 when the cement was carbonate, to 3 : 1 or higher when the matrix was palygorskite. Occasionally the ratio in the latter was even higher. The clasts consisted of quartz, feldspar, and some Mg-rich metamorphic minerals. The palygorskite matrix fibres were arranged in mats within which they had parallel orientation. The mats or 'domains', which had a length of 15-25 square m and a width of about 40 square m, showed random orientation. In analogy to the term 'calcrete' the term 'palycrete' is used for the palygorskite duricrusts. The palycrete, of an average thickness of 0.5 m, frequently rested directly on the Hercynian basement rocks, and was covered by a recent solum. In the B horizons of the solum, the palygorskite appeared to undergo recent weathering and transformation into smectite. The duricrusts were proposed to have formed by authigenic calcite or palygorskite, which filled the interstices between clastic particles that had been deposited on Hercynian basement rocks following their peneplanation in the early Tertiary. The proposed environment of deposition and formation was that of an intermittent playa-lake in a semi-arid, seasonal climate, where strong evaporative processes had been active. Alteration and weathering of the mafic minerals contained in some of the clasts, in addition to interstitial solutions rich in Si and Mg, had created the chemical environment required for palygorskite neoformation. From the state of weathering-disintegration of the palygorskite in the soils formed on the palycrete, it is inferred that the environment for palygorskite neoformation had ceased to exist after palycrete formation.																			0004-9573	1446-568X					2000	38	1					169	188		10.1071/SR99002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/SR99002													WOS:000084956000014
J	Lhomme, JP; Vacher, JJ				Lhomme, JP; Vacher, JJ			Modelling nocturnal heat dynamics and frost mitigation in Andean raised field systems	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												The raised fields system is an old technique of soil and water management dating back to prehispanic time. Very common in the Lake Titicaca region, it essentially consists of a series of earth platforms on which crops are grown, surrounded by water canals connected to inlet and outlet ditches. An important and widely recognised benefit of this system of management is its contribution to frost mitigation during the growing season. A physical process-based model is presented to explain the role played by the canals in the nocturnal heat dynamics and the cold mitigation process. Adapted from a two-layer transfer scheme (Shuttleworth-Wallace type) with a vegetation layer and a substrate layer representing the canals, the model shows that greater heat flux emanating from the canals and greater water condensation on the crop both contribute to the mitigation effect. Model outputs are compared with experimental data collected on a system of raised fields in the Lake Titicaca region. Crop temperature appears to be correctly estimated and more accurately than water temperature. When used in a predictive way, the model shows that wider canals or narrower platforms have a positive impact on the minimum crop temperature reached during the night. Increasing water depth also improves frost mitigation, but conversely, a deeper canal (with the same level of water) has a negative impact. Leaf area index (LAI) and crop height, both have a positive impact. Higher wind velocity or higher air relative humidity also enhances the frost mitigation effect. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Zooplankton was most abundant during the warm and rainy season corresponding to the flood event (July to October) with peaks for rotifers and cyclopoid copepods in July-August and September-October, respectively. Filamentous cyanobacteria were the dominant phytoplankton during the warm season (August to November), while diatoms were dominant during the cool season (December to April). Temperature increase and river flooding both played an important role in these successions, favoring intense development of cyanobacteria and cyclopoid copepods. Trophic interactions also seem to be an important factor in structuring of the plankton community. Overall, the plankton composition displayed a trend toward a eutrophication state. Our study confirms the existence of seasonality in zooplankton communities and the importance of using biological indicators such as phyto- and zooplankton to monitor water quality, in particular in tropical freshwater ecosystems.																			1434-2944	1522-2632				SEP	2011	96	4					405	424		10.1002/iroh.201111358	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.201111358													WOS:000295374900006
J	Murase, A; Sunobe, T				Murase, Atsunobu; Sunobe, Tomoki			Interspecific territoriality in males of the tube blenny Neoclinus bryope (Actinopterygii: Chaenopsidae)	JOURNAL OF ETHOLOGY												Territoriality was investigated in the tube blenny Neoclinus bryope (Actinopterygii: Chaenopsidae) at rocky intertidal areas of Banda Beach, Tateyama Bay, central Japan. Males used small holes as spawning nests, usually staying at the nest and maintaining the area while showing exclusive behaviors. Their home ranges were limited to areas within 30 cm distance from the nest for over 2 months. Four heterospecific fishes were threatened when they approached to within 6-14 cm of the nest holes, and two species of carnivorous snails were removed at points 0-30 cm from the nest entrance. There were no significant differences between the distances from the nest entrances to the points defended against fish and those used for foraging. As the four heterospecific species have similar feeding habits to those of N. bryope, the area defended against fishes may function as a foraging territory. At 24 h following the removal of nest owners, carnivorous snails had gathered to actively prey on eggs, indicating that the area defended against snails may function as a territory for protection against egg predators. Although the positions of females where males started courtship displays were significantly farther than the foraging points and the positions of threatened fishes, males displayed no territoriality against conspecific males. The fact that males did not leave the nest hole during the courtship suggests that it may be costly to maintain a courtship territory. These results show that males of tube blenny maintain territories for egg guarding and for protecting food resources around their nest holes in the spawning season.																			0289-0771					SEP	2011	29	3					467	472		10.1007/s10164-011-0276-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10164-011-0276-y													WOS:000294179500009

The interaction between epibionts and substrate organisms is not very well known, particularly in subtropical environments of South America. In the present work, we analyzed the prevalence, density, biomass and attachment sites of C. vesiculosum on planktonic microcrustaceans from Paiva Lake, a subtropical lake of Argentina. With the aim to evaluate whether epibionts affect the filtering rates of Notodiaptomus spiniger, the dominant planktonic crustacean, we carried out bioassays using phytoplankton <53 mu m. Crustaceans were sampled using a PVC tube (1.2m long and 10cm in diameter), filtering 50L of water through a 53 mu m-mesh. Microcrustaceans were counted in Bogorov chambers under a stereoscopic microscope. The infested organisms were separated and observed with a photonic microscope to determine density and biovolume of epibionts, by analyzing their distribution on the exoskeleton. The prevalence of C. vesiculosum was higher in adult crustaceans than in their larvae and juveniles. The most infested group was that of calanoid copepods, related to their high density. The attachment sites on the exoskeleton were found to be the portions of the body which have a higher probability of encounter with epibionts during locomotion and feeding, i.e., antennae and thoracic legs in copepods, and thoracic legs and postabdomen in cladocerans. The similar values found in the filtering rate of infested and uninfested individuals of N. spiniger and the constant prevalence (<40%) of epibiont algae, suggest that C. vesiculosum does not condition the life of planktonic crustaceans of Paiva Lake.

The bird footprints occur in the thin-bedded and interlaminated fine-grained sandstone and siltstone-mudstone. Sauropod dinosaur tracks and small invertebrate trace fossils are associated, and polygonal mud cracks, symmetrical and asymmetrical ripple marks, and evaporite mineral casts were observed in these deposits. They suggest that bird footprints-bearing deposits were deposited on a dry mudflat. The bird footprint fossils at study area were classified into three ichnospecies based on the size and morphology of the footprints. Koreanaornis hamanensis (K type tracks) range from 1.9 to 3.4 cm in length (2.4 cm in average) and from 2.4 to 4.4 cm in width (3.0 cm in average). The average divarication angle between digits II and IV is about 119 degrees (90-140 degrees in range), and the length/width ratio is about 0.81 in average. Jindongornipes kimi (J type tracks) range from 3.3 to 7.2 cm in length (5.6 cm in average) and from 3.7 to 8.5 cm in width (6.4 cm in average). The average divarication angle between digits II and IV is about 138 degrees (103-163 degrees in range), and the length/width ratio is about 0.79 in average. J type tracks usually display vivid heels and hallux impressions. However, digit impressions are separated due to the development of subtle heels and hallux impressions are occasionally absent. Web-footed bird tracks (W type tracks) range from 4.0 cm to 5.4 cm in length (4.8 cm in average) and from 4.7 cm to 7.3 cm in width (5.3 cm in average). The average divarication angle between digits II and IV is about 122 degrees (100-144 degrees in range), and the length/width ratio is about 0.9 in average. W type tracks are similar to Hwangsanipes choughi in size. However, webbed footprints of the study area are different from Hwangsanipes choughi in the aspects of the absence of hallux impressions and curved inward digits II and IV Web-footed tracks of the study area are different from previously reported webbed footprints in Korea in size and morphology, which suggests that W type tracks are a new ichnotaxon. K type tracks are the most abundant at study area. In places it is difficult to identify trackways of K type due to their high track density. The abundance and high density of K type tracks at study area suggest that trackmaker of K type inhabited in group at an area or had a higher level of activity of a few individuals. The cooccurrence of diverse bird footprint fossils associated with small invertebrate traces and dinosaur tracks in a small area like Hogyeri fossil sites is unique in the Mesozoic bird footprint records. It implies that Hogyeri dry mudflat was one of the vital ecosite exploited by dinosaurs, birds, and invertebrates during the draught season like as in recent Savannah area.																			0435-4036	2288-7377				DEC	2008	44	6					729	745																WOS:000453974500002

L16804	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												We demonstrate a direct connection between anomalously high levels of NO3- in aerosols over the northeastern U. S. with transport of air masses from south of the Great Lakes during periods of unseasonably warm climatic conditions in that area. Previous studies document the predominant and pervasive role of SO42- and organic matter in regional aerosol composition over the Northeast. Here we characterize multi-day episodic events where NO3- exceeded SO42- by up to 3-fold at Mount Washington and increased from the seasonal median of about 1 nmol m(-3) to 60 - 100 nmol m(-3). These events take place in the colder seasons, with the three most significant ones in the last 6 years occurring in November 2001, January 2002, and March 2004. We propose that large amounts of NH3 are volatilized in the Midwest under these conditions, which exceeds available SO42- and allows high levels of NH4NO3 aerosol to form. The occurrence of these events, which completely changes the character of aerosols over the Northeast and may lead to enhanced NO3- deposition to ecosystems, could increase with continued warming over North America.

Mechanisms stabilizing the plant-dominated clear-water state were investigated in Little Mere, U.K. Replicated, factorial, mesocosm experiments, carried out in 1995 and 1996, were designed to investigate the relative importance of top-down (zooplankton grazing) and bottom-up (nitrogen-limitation) control in Limiting algal growth, and the role of macrophytes in these processes. Treatments included increased salinity (1995) and sticklebacks (1996) to reduce zooplankton numbers, weekly nitrate additions and removal of macrophytes. 2. Contrary to the results of other studies, submerged plants did not reduce nitrate concentrations. Owing to the high stickleback density in the enclosures with fish, macrophytes did not provide a refuge for zooplankton during the experiment. In Little Mere, however, where fish densities are lower, macrophytes probably play a key role in maintaining clear water by providing refuge for pelagic zooplankton and habitat for attached Cladocera. 3. Phytoplankton in Little Mere was not nitrogen- (N) limited during the growing season. Although nitrogen availability sets a maximum potential phytoplankton biomass it was not realized owing to control by zooplankton grazing.																			0046-5070					JUN	1998	39	4					699	713		10.1046/j.1365-2427.1998.00321.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.1998.00321.x													WOS:000074535600009
J	Knox, JC				Knox, JC			Late quaternary Upper Mississippi River alluvial episodes and their significance to the Lower Mississippi River system	ENGINEERING GEOLOGY					Conference on Geology in the Lower Mississippi Valley - Implications for Engineering, the Half Century Since Fisk 1944	DEC 05-08, 1994	VICKSBURG, MS					The period in the Upper Mississippi Valley (UMV) from about 25 000 years B.P. until the time of strong human influence on the landscape beginning about 150-200 years ago can be characterized by three distinctly different alluvial episodes. The first episode is dominated by the direct and indirect effects of Late Wisconsin glacial ice in the basin headwaters. This period, which lasted until about 14 000 years B.P., was generally a time of progressive valley aggradation by a braided river system transporting large quantities of bedload sediment. An island braided system evolved during the second episode, which extended from about 14 000 to 9000 years B.P. The second episode is associated with major environmental changes of deglaciation when occurrences of major hoods and sustained flows of low sediment concentration from drainage of proglacial lakes produced major downcutting. By the time of the beginning of the third episode about 9000 years B.P., most vegetation communities had established their approximate average Holocene locations. The change of climate and establishment of good vegetation cover caused upland landscapes of the UMV to become relatively stable during the Holocene in comparison to their relative instability during the Late Wisconsin. However, Holocene remobilization of Late Wisconsin age sediment stored in tributary valleys resulted in a return to long-term upper Mississippi River aggradation. The dominance of Holocene deposition over transportation reflects the abundance of sandy bedload sediment introduced from tributaries and the situation that energy conditions for floods and the hydraulic gradient of the upper Mississippi River are much less for the Holocene than they were for the Late Wisconsin and deglaciation periods. Outburst floods from glacial lakes appear to have been common in the UMV during the Late Wisconsin and especially during deglaciation. Magnitudes for the Late Wisconsin floods are generally poorly understood, but an estimate of 10 000-15 000 m(3) s(-1) was determined for one of the largest events in the northern UMV based on heights of paleo-foreset beds in a flood unit deposited in the Savanna Terrace. For comparison, the great hood of 1993 on the upper Mississippi River was about 12 000 m(3) s(-1) at Keokuk, Iowa, near the Des Moines River confluence where it represented the 500-year event in relation to modern flood series. Exceptionally large outburst floods derived from the rapid drainage of pro-glacial Lake Michigan and adjacent smaller proglacial lakes between about 16 000 and 15 500 years B.P. are a likely cause of the final diversion of the Mississippi River through the Bell City-Oran Gap at the upstream end of the Lower Mississippi Valley (LMV). The largest outburst hood from northern extremities of the UMV appears to have occurred between about 11 700 and 10 800 years B.P. when the southern outlet of Lake Agassiz was incised. Based on the probable maximum capacity of the Agassiz flood channel 600 km downstream near the junction of the Wisconsin and Mississippi Rivers, the Agassiz flood discharge apparently did not exceed 30 000 m(3) s(-1). However, if the Agassiz flood channel here is expanded to include an incised component, then the flood discharge maximum could have been as large as 100,000 to 125 000 m(3) s(-1). The larger flood is presently viewed as unlikely, however, because held evidence suggests that the incised component of the cross-section probably developed after the main Agassiz flood event. Nevertheless, the large Agassiz flood between about 11 700 and 10 800 years B.P. produced major erosional downcutting and removal of Late Wisconsin sediment in the UMV. This flood also appears to be mainly responsible for the final diversion of the Mississippi River through Thebes Gap in extreme southwestern Illinois and the formation of the Charleston alluvial fan at the head of the LMV. After about 9000 years B.P. prairie-forest ecotones with associated steep seasonal climatic boundaries were established across the northern and southern regions of the UMV. The general presence of these steep climatically sensitive boundaries throughout the Holocene, in concert with the natural tendency for grasslands to be especially sensitive to climatic change, may partially explain why widespread synchroneity of Holocene alluvial episodes is recognized across the upper Mississippi River and Missouri River drainage systems. Comparison of estimated beginning ages of Holocene flood episodes and alluvial chronologies for upper Mississippi River and Missouri River systems with beginning ages for LMV meander belts and delta lobes shows a relatively strong correlation. At present, dating controls are not sufficiently adequate and confidence intervals associated with the identified ages representing system changes are too large to establish firm causal connections. Although the limitations of the existing data are numerous, the implicit causal connections suggested from existing information suggest that further exploration would be beneficial to improving the understanding of how upper valley hydrological and geomorphic events are influencing hydrological and geomorphic activity in the LMV. Since nearly 80% of the Mississippi River drainage system lies upstream of the confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers, there is a strong basis for supporting the idea that UMV fluvial activity should be having a strong influence on LMV fluvial activity. If this assertion is correct, then the traditional assignment of strong to dominant control by eustatic sea level variations for explaining channel avulsions, delta lobes, and meander belts in the LMV needs re-examination. A stronger role for upper valley fluvial activity as a factor influencing lower valley fluvial activity does not disregard the role of eustatic sea level, tectonic processes or other factors. Rather, upper valley fluvial episodes or specific events such as extreme floods may commonly serve as a ''triggering mechanism'' that causes a threshold of instability to be exceeded in a system that was poised for change due to sea level rise, tectonic uplift, or other environmental factors. In other situations, the upper valley fluvial activity may exert a more dominant control over many LMV fluvial processes and landforms as frequently was the case during times of glacial climatic conditions.																			0013-7952					DEC 30	1996	45	1-4					263	285		10.1016/S0013-7952(96)00017-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0013-7952(96)00017-8													WOS:A1996WE89100015
J	Senn, DB; Hemond, HF				Senn, DB; Hemond, HF			Particulate arsenic and iron during anoxia in a eutrophic, urban lake	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												The bioavailability and transport of particle-reactive pollutants are influenced by their partitioning between dissolved and particulate phases. We explored the importance of particle complexation to the arsenic cycle in an urban lake (Upper Mystic Lake, eastern MA, USA) that experiences arsenic remobilization from contaminated sediments during seasonal hypolimnetic anoxia. Particle size distributions were measured using a new in situ serial filtration system that excludes oxygen and filters at low flow rates to minimize filtration artifacts. Despite anoxia, the majority of remobilized As was present as As(V), and typically 85 to 95% of total As was particle complexed, with 25 to 50% found in the size fraction between 0.4 and 0.05 mum. Iron was distributed similarly among these size classes (>95% of total Fe associated with particles larger than 0.05 mum, 30 to 50% between 0.4 mum and 0.05 mum), contrary to conventional expectation that the majority of Fe should be present as soluble Fe(II) in anoxic waters. By classical filtration (i.e., through a 0.4-mum filter), the colloidal fractions of both Fe and As would have been inaccurately classified as dissolved. Correlations between depth profiles of total As and particulate Fe as well as comparisons of measured arsenic sorption (i.e., total As > 0.05 mum) against predictions by surface complexation modeling of As on amorphous Fe(III) oxides argue that arsenic sorbed on Fe(Ill) oxides was the major As species present in this lake's hypolimnion throughout several months of anoxia.

J	Chen, ZK; Elvidge, CD; Groeneveld, DP				Chen, ZK; Elvidge, CD; Groeneveld, DP			Monitoring seasonal dynamics of arid land vegetation using AVIRIS data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Seasonal changes in the density of photosynthetically active vegetation have been observed in derivative-based green vegetation index (DGVI) values derived from AVIRIS reflectance spectra of arid land shrub and salt-grass communities adjacent to Mono Lake, California. The study was conducted using AVIRIS datasets acquired in late August and early October of 1992. 2DZ_DGVI (second-order DGVI-derived in reference to zero baseline) showed a strong linear relationship (r(2)>0.93 for August and October) with green leaf area index (LA1) values of ten bitterbrush (Purshia tridentata) sample stands. After accounting for background errors introduced to the calculation of 1DL_DGVI (first-order DGVI-derived in reference to local rock-soil baseline), a modified 1DL_DGVI (1DL_MDGVI) exhibited a high linear correlation (r(2)>0.92 for both seasons) with green LAI values of the bitterbrush stands. 2DZ_DGVI was applied to the two AVIRIS scenes acquired for the two periods to quantify and compare green vegetation cover. Areas covered by saltgrass (Distichlis spicata var. stricta) showed the largest change in 2DZ_DGVI from August to October. Shrubs, including bitterbrush and big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata), changed less during the same period. The lowest seasonal change in 2DZ_DGVI occurred in barren areas and locations covered by Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi). The DGVI concept has potential for monitoring ecosystems in arid and semiarid lands where the influence of exposed rock-soil backgrounds reduces the effectiveness of broadband red-vs.-NIR vegetation indices.

Annual and diel variations in methane (CH4) release in stands of Equisetum fluviatile were measured from June to November in Lake Paajarvi, southern Finland, where E. fluviatile is the dominant emergent macrophyte. An estimate of total annual release of CH4 from stands of E. fluviatile in this lake was also made. Diel variation was measured twice (June and August), whereas measurements for annual variation were performed monthly. The hypothesis that a relationship exists between the productivity of stands and CH4 release was also tested, whereupon net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 as well as standing stock of E. fluviatile were determined, in addition to simultaneous recordings of air temperature and solar radiation. 2. Seasonal variations in CH4 release were pronounced, with the highest release rate of 813 mg m(-2) day(-1) measured in July and the lowest 6.5 mg m(-2) day(-1) in November, when the shoreline was already frozen. 3. Methane release rates were strongly correlated with mean air temperature in the measuring chambers and with total solar radiation. There was no significant correlation between the instantaneous radiation and CH4 release rates. 4. The seasonal patterns of CH4 release and NEE of CO2 resembled each other, except in July when NEE suddenly dropped. The decrease in NEE coincided with the highest CH4 release rate measured and the highest temperature during the measuring period, i.e. 32 degrees C outside and 37 degrees C inside the chamber. Excluding this date, daily CH4 release was strongly correlated with NEE (r(2) = 0.971). 5. No diel changes in CH4 release rates were detected. In June and August the maximum release rates were 11.4 and 16.8 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1), respectively. 6. The standing stock of E. fluviatile at different times of the growing season was not correlated with CH4 efflux; the CH4 release rates could be related neither to the number of shoots, i.e. sufficient conduits for gas transport were always present, nor to the shoot biomass in the measuring chambers. 7. For an estimate of the annual release, the monthly values measured at noon were integrated over the entire growing season; this resulted in 43.7g CH4 m(-2) for the annual emission. The total annual emission of CH4 from the area covered with E. fluviatile in Lake Paajarvi was calculated to be approximate to 5000 kg.					; Hyvönen, Terho/ABA-3066-2021	Hyvonen, Terho/0000-0001-7225-6740; 													0046-5070					SEP	1998	40	2					275	284		10.1046/j.1365-2427.1998.00351.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.1998.00351.x													WOS:000076154400007
