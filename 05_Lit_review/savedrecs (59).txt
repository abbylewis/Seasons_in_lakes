C	Frenette, JJ; Vincent, WF		Kumagai, M; Vincent, WF		Frenette, JJ; Vincent, WF			Bio-optical variability in the littoral zone: Local heterogeneity and implications for water quality monitoring	FRESHWATER MANAGEMENT: GLOBAL VERSUS LOCAL PERSPECTIVES					Symposium on the Lake Debate held in conjunction with the World Lakes Conference	OCT, 2001	LAKE BIWA RES INST, OTSU, JAPAN		LAKE BIWA RES INST			The understanding of local, small-scale heterogeneity is critical to the successful monitoring and management of whole lake ecosystems. This variability may involve differences in physical and chemical characteristics which in turn control biological community structure, biodiversity and local water quality. The littoral zone typically shows the highest productivity per unit area because of the high availability of light for photosynthesis in the water column and the transfer of nutrients from the adjacent watershed. Although light exerts a controlling influence on aquatic ecosystems, little information is available about the bio-optical variability of inshore waters. This variability is likely to generate increased physical complexity, favouring a broad range of species. Optical factors may also operate as selective pressures for organisms living in the littoral zone due to the greater UV exposure and other changes in the underwater spectral composition. In this chapter, we examine the factors controlling light in the littoral zone as a key component and also index of habitat variability in lakes. We address the potential to use bio-optical criteria and technologies as a guide to habitat variability and for water quality monitoring. Optical measurements now offer enormous potential for the study of algal blooms, eutrophication and shifts in plankton community structure. We illustrate the application of bio-optical analysis by way of our recent results from the south and north basins of Lake Biwa, Japan, and from Lake Saint-Pierre, Canada, a shallow fluvial lake that experiences seasonal flooding.

Bacillariophyta was found to be the dominating group. Navicula rhynchocephala, N. salinarum, Amphora ovalis, Nitzschia palea, Oscillatoria limosa and Closterium parvulum were the dominating species in the benthic algal flora. The dominant species indicate organic pollution in the sediments of KZDR. The water temperature mostly influenced growth of benthic algae in this study.																			1018-4619						2003	12	9					1025	1032																WOS:000185935900012
J	Hamblin, PF; Bootsma, HA; Hecky, RE				Hamblin, PF; Bootsma, HA; Hecky, RE			Surface meteorological observations over Lake Malawi/Nyasa	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Over-lake surface meteorology is essential for the estimation of lake evaporation and for the forcing of lake water quality and circulation models. A roving meteorological station was mounted aboard the research vessel, R/V Usipa, on Lake Malawi/Nyasa. Ship velocity and position were recorded, thus permitting winds to be corrected aboard the moving platform. This type of data is particularly sparse for tropical lakes. Of the eight full-lake cruises over the period from February, 1997 to May 1999, four yielded usable data comprising 3,316 30-min averages but restricted mainly to the wet season. In addition to winds, air temperatures, relative humidities, and water temperatures were recorded. Similar parameters were measured concurrently at up to four fixed locations on the shoreline providing a basis for comparison. An examination of the longest running series of winds and air temperatures showed no obvious inter-annual differences in wind speed and air temperature. Based on wind spectra, winds were divided into a diurnal component and a longer term smoothed component by digital filtering. Analysis of the shipboard winds shows an unexpectedly strong diurnal wind field in the open lake which appears to be dominated by the diurnal atmospheric circulation along the eastern shoreline. This effect is likely due to the interaction between southeast trade winds and the diurnal wind field. The long-term smoothed winds vary along the longitudinal axis of the lake, being weakest at the extremities and strongest in the middle. Calculations of an average evaporation rate based on observed meteorological data from all temporal scales using three methods resulted in a mean of 6.4 +/- 1 mm/d. Diurnal meteorological fluctuations accounted for 36% of the total evaporation.																			0380-1330						2003	29			2			19	33		10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70536-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70536-X													WOS:000221126800003
J	Rodrigo, MA; Rojo, C; Alvarez-Cobelas, M				Rodrigo, MA; Rojo, C; Alvarez-Cobelas, M			Autotrophic and heterotrophic picoplankton in wetlands: Differences with lake patterns	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY												This study describes the occurrence, importance and seasonal patterns of picoplankton in two wetlands (TDNP and La Safor), and compares them to a system of fifteen interconnected lakes (Ruidera). In TDNP we performed a six-year monthly study in three sites of the wetland. Bacterial abundance increased throughout time and the autotrophic picoplankton (APP) range was wide (up to 33 x 10(6) cells/ml). The annual averaged APP contribution to total picoplankton and phytoplankton biovolumes was 0.5-22% and 0.03-6% respectively. There were large differences among sites in terms of APP absolute and relative abundance and seasonal patterns. In La Safor, the APP relative contribution to picoplankton and phytoplankton biovolumes was 0-25% and 0-40%, respectively, while in the Ruidera lakes was 0-47% and 0-5%, respectively. In the three systems there was a significant correlation between bacterial abundance and chlorophyll a but the slopes of the linear regressions were different. No significant relationships were found of APP abundance and trophic status in the wetlands, but were noted in the lake system. There was no clear relationship of APP contribution to total phytoplankton biomass to the trophic gradient in wetlands. In the lakes, the higher contribution of APP was found in those with higher trophic levels.

J	FRIDAY, LE				FRIDAY, LE			MEASURING INVESTMENT IN CARNIVORY - SEASONAL AND INDIVIDUAL VARIATION IN TRAP NUMBER AND BIOMASS IN UTRICULARIA-VULGARIS L	NEW PHYTOLOGIST												The partitioning of biomass between traps and leaves is a measure of the investment in carnivory of Utricularia vulgaris and is dependent on the relative values of three attributes: trap size, trap number and leaf size. Marked seasonal and individual variations in trap size, trap number and leaf size occur within a small Population of U. vulgaris at Wicken Fen, Cambridgeshire, UK, with some plants consistently having fewer traps per leaf than others, and some smaller leaves than others, throughout the growing season. However, the three attributes vary independently, so that all combinations over the observed ranges of trap size, trap number and leaf size occur simultaneously in the population. In spite of the variation in the three constituent factors, the proportion of biomass invested in traps is close to 50 % in the majority of plants and throughout most of the growing season. The contribution of traps to total biomass cannot be predicted from the number of traps per leaf. Although the proportion of biomass represented by traps is the most useful measure of a plant's investment in carnivory, the precise way in which the biomass is partitioned between a variable number of traps of different sizes may also be an important consideration in cost-benefit analyses.																			0028-646X					JUL	1992	121	3					439	445		10.1111/j.1469-8137.1992.tb02944.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.1992.tb02944.x								33874146					WOS:A1992JG34900010

We estimated a threshold temperature for spawning of 13 degrees C at four sites and 10 degrees C at two colder sites. A delay of 2 or 3 days was observed between the threshold and the onset of spawning. On average, the degree-day equations predicted the attainment of the developmental phases with an accuracy of 1.6 days, except at the two colder sites, where developmental rates were faster than predicted. The lower spawning temperatures and faster developmental rates observed at the colder sites were interpreted as adaptations to the reduced growing season. Finally, at one site the drift of swim-up larvae occurred over a 6-day period even though spawning lasted 24 days; it was not possible to determine the exact duration of drift at the other sites. This synchronization could be an adaptation lowering the risk of predation on individual larvae, as all the larvae enter the lake within a few days.

J	ROJO, C; RODRIGUEZ, J				ROJO, C; RODRIGUEZ, J			SEASONAL VARIABILITY OF PHYTOPLANKTON SIZE STRUCTURE IN A HYPERTROPHIC LAKE	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												In this paper, we describe the time dynamics of phytoplankton size-biomass spectra over a 60 week period in a hypertrophic lake (El Porcal, near Madrid, Spain). Average total phytoplankton biomass was 59.5 mg l-1, and 58 taxa were present which had between 1.8 and 38.5 mum equivalent spherical diameter (ESD). Average biomass of pico-, nano- and microplankton was 0.04, 23 and 36.2 mg l-1, respectively. The average size-biomass spectrum was characterized by a higher amount of biomass in larger cells (biomass increase as the 0.59 power of body volume). The multivariate analysis generated five conspicuous groups of normalized biomass spectra which led to understanding of global dynamics as a time sequence of size structures in the studied lake. During a long equilibrium period, normalized biomass spectra change towards less negative slopes, i.e. an increase of larger cells. During the periods with a higher frequency of perturbations, the spectra evolve towards more negative slopes (increase of smaller cells). A comparison of this study with data from other aquatic systems suggests that the size-biomass spectrum is related to trophic state. In El Porcal Lake, size-spectrum descriptions are an adequate tool in the dynamic study of the phytoplankton community.					; Rojo, Carmen/L-5358-2014; Herrera, Juan/I-3210-2015	Rodriguez, Jaime/0000-0002-4143-883X; 													0142-7873	1464-3774				APR	1994	16	4					317	335		10.1093/plankt/16.4.317	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/16.4.317													WOS:A1994NH96200002

This study aimed to examine the presence of honey bee viruses in Apis and non-Apis bee species, the mite Varroa destructor, and pollinated plants in Armenia.Materials and Methods: Sampling was performed in Tavush Province, in the northeast of the Republic of Armenia, from August to November 2019. Overall, 200 A. mellifera bees, 50 V. destructor mites, and 20 wasps were collected (corresponding to three bees, five mites, and 2-11 wasps in each investigated sample) and homogenized for RNA isolation and detection of viruses. Ten pollinated plants were taken from each plant, and 2 g of each sample was used for homogenization. In each investigated case Apis mellifera, Varroa destructor, Vespula germanica and plants received percentages of the virus presence.Results: Six important honey bee viruses (acute bee paralysis virus [ABPV], deformed wing virus [DWV], A. mellifera norovirus [ANV], Lake Sinai virus-2 [LSV-2], Big Sioux River virus [BSRV], and A. mellifera filamentous virus [AmFV]) were detected in samples by polymerase chain reaction. Our results showed that DWV, ANV, and ABPV were the most common viruses in honey bees. All viruses were detected in wasps, but LSV-2 and ANV were present in almost all samples.Conclusion: Our results showed that almost all viruses were present in V. destructor. Although ANV is very common in honey bees, it did not appear in any mite samples. Our study indicates that viruses typically associated with honey bees were also actively infecting wasps. Our data suggest that the survival of viruses in plants can be an important source of seasonal transmission of viruses to bees. In addition, pollinated plants can potentially serve as reservoirs for honey bee viruses.

J	Astrahan, P; Lupu, A; Leibovici, E; Ninio, S				Astrahan, Peleg; Lupu, Achsa; Leibovici, Edit; Ninio, Shira			BTEX and PAH contributions to Lake Kinneret water: a seasonal-based study of volatile and semi-volatile anthropogenic pollutants in freshwater sources	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX) BTEX molecules are toxic components, ubiquitous in the environment, often found in concentrations- a few orders of magnitude higher than the well-studied PAHs levels. This fact is demonstrated in either crude oil, fuels, water, and air samples. BTEX studies focus mainly on the airborne levels of these molecules, while their waterborne presence is understudied. In this study, BTEX levels were assessed at Lake Kinneret, Israel. As a result, 0-1.5 ppb of BTEX was recorded in five stations (2021-2022). Elevated BTEX levels (3-10 ppb) were recorded at the northern rivers nourishing this lake, implying the existence of remote polluting sources. Transect air samplings of BTEX conducted at the lake next to the bathing season of 2021 revealed airborne BTEX levels between 0.8 and 10 mu g/m(3), peaking up close to the bathing season, yet inconsistent with the BTEX water level trend. Lake water samples collected next to Tiberias city outfalls following the "Carmel" rainstorm showed elevated concentrations of BTEX up to 35 ppb and PAHs up to 0.47 ppb with an urban isotopic signal. The remote station's PAHs levels were less than one order of magnitude, with a distinct rural isotopic signal. Additionally, a human-specific microbial marker revealed increased sewer contributions at some of the urbansites. The results of this study show that a wide area dispersion of low atmospheric BTEX levels exists in the lake's perimeter. The dispersion rate is most likely influenced by season-based factors, e.g., motors and biomass fires. The unstudied waterborne BTEX levels in this lake are influenced by rivers, city runoff, and other yet unknown factors that may contribute to the sedimentation of these components. This process may result in a chronic pollution state. Despite the BTEX's medium-low solubility and high volatility, its under-evaluated waterborne transportation may lead to high toxic levels following bioaccumulation.

J	Mukherjee, NR; Krishna, AP				Mukherjee, Nikita Roy; Krishna, A. P.			Surface area change detection of snow/ice cover over Zemu Glacier of Sikkim Himalaya	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												This study assessed the snow/ice surface area changes over the Zemu Glacier in the Eastern Himalayas. Zemu is considered to be the largest glacier in the Eastern Himalayas located in the Sikkim State of India. Change detection in the snow/ice surface areal extent of the Zemu Glacier was delineated from the year 1945 using US Army Map Service-Topographical Sheets and Landsat imageries available from 1987 to 2020. The results obtained solely focus on surface-change delineation using remote sensing satellite data and GIS software. Landsat imagery of the years 1987, 1997, 2009, 2018, and 2020 was used for snow and ice pixel extraction. Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI), Snow Cover Index (S3), and new band ratio index were used to extract the pure snow and ice pixels, fresh snow, and debris-covered snow/ice area and pixels mixed with shadow to demarcate the surface area changes. Manual delineation was required and undertaken for better results. A slope raster image was generated from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM) data to delineate the slope and hill shade. The results illustrate that the snow/ice surface covering the glacier had an area of 113.5 km(2) in the year 1945 which was reduced to 78.31 km(2) in the year 2020 indicating a total snow/ice surface area loss of 31% in 75 years. A loss of 11.45% was observed from 1945 to 1987 in the areal extent, while from 1987 to 2009, a decadal loss of approximately 7% was observed. The surface area loss of 8.46% from 2009 to 2018 led to infer the maximum loss of snow and ice over the glacier body at a rate of 0.94% per year. Between the years 2018 and 2020, the glacier lost 1.08% of its surface area. The Accumulation Area Ratio (AAR) considering the accumulation and ablation areas of the glacier indicated a gradual decline of the accumulation zone in the recent years. Global Land Ice Measurement from Space (GLIMS) program data with RGI version 6.0 was used as a reference to demarcate the areal extent of Zemu Glacier. The study gained above 80% of overall accuracy by generating a confusion matrix in ArcMap. The analysis of this seasonal snow/ice cover showed that there has been a drastic decline in the surface snow/ice cover area over the Zemu Glacier over the years 1987 to 2020 and NDSI; S3 analysis provided improved results to delineate snow/ice cover area over such steep terrain topography of Sikkim Himalaya.

Yearly average chlorophyll-a concentration was 11 mu g l(-1), while the corresponding values of bacterioplankton and heterotrophic nanoflagellate (HNF) plankton biomass (fresh weight) were 0.24 mg l(-1) and 0.35 mg l(-1), respectively. About half of planktonic primary production was channelled through bacterioplankton on the yearly basis. However, there was no significant correlation between phytoplankton biomass and bacterial abundance. Bacterial specific growth rates were in the range of 0.009 and 0.09 h(-1), and ended to follow the seasonal changes in water temperature. In some periods of the year, predator-prey relationships between the HNF and bacterial abundance were obvious. The estimated HNF grazing on bacteria varied between 3% and 227% of the daily bacterial production. On an annual basis, 87% of bacterial cell production was grazed by HNF plankton.																			0018-8158					NOV 15	1996	339	1-3					57	65		10.1007/BF00008913	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008913													WOS:A1996WC90400008

(2) The lake was mildly nutrient-rich (mesotrophic) early in its history. (3) The lower part of the core shows large variations in diatom concentrations and distinct lithological changes, including broad bands of silt and short sections of laminated sediments, which suggest fluctuating lake levels in the early Holocene. (4) Increased concentrations of the blue-green algal pigment oxcillaxanthin indicate the expansion of Oscillatoria about 6000 years B.P., probably in response to increased stabilization of the water column. (5) The subsequent preservation of over 3 m of laminated sediments in the mid-Holocene and extremely high pigment concentrations indicate a long period of moderate water levels and seasonal hypolimnetic oxygen depletion. (6) Increased pigment concentrations and percentages of diatom taxa characteristic of moderately enriched lakes correlate with pollen evidence of Neolithic and Bronze Age forest disturbance. (7) The termination of the laminated sediments and a transition from a Cyclotella-dominated diatom assemblage to one dominated by Stephanodiscus spp. correlate with pollen evidence of widespread deforestation. Thus rapid and sustained eutrophication of the mere probably resulted from increased nutrient inputs caused by forest clearance. (8) The mere remained eutrophic throughout the remainder of its history, and subsequent shifts in the diatom community indicate limnological responses to agricultural practices associated with Cannabis cultivation and later to the growth of a town around the mere.																			0022-0477	1365-2745				MAR	1989	77	1					182	202		10.2307/2260924	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2260924													WOS:A1989U626300013

Multiple linear regression analyses suggest that total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and light (as estimated from Sechhi disc transparency and the depth of the mixed layer) interact to determine the relative biomass of planktonic blue-green algae. At a fixed TN:TP ratio, blue-green relative biomass increases as light availability decreases. At a fixed light level, blue-green relative biomass also increases as the TN:TP ratio decreases. Both effects are consistent with current knowledge of algal physiology, and with a recently proposed theoretical framework for algal community structure.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				JAN	1986	43	1					148	153		10.1139/f86-016	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f86-016													WOS:A1986AYV4700016

The main mapping techniques currently employed are based on digital data, which are used to create digital elevation models (DEMs). The aim of the present study is to devise and apply methodologies for the generation and validation of high-resolution mapping materials, usable both for local, large-scale analyses, and for the calculation of certain morphometric parameters based on structure from motion (SFM) techniques, applied to images acquired by means of a drone at low cost. As a case study, the ruins of the Belci dam, located in Romania, were analysed, where, with the help of a drone, GIS measurements were performed on the arborescent vegetation of the study area, and a digital terrain model (DTM) of the dam was generated. The costs of such a methodological endeavour are low, which allows for the repetition of the steps involved in devising the maps necessary for such studies on a weekly, seasonal, or annual basis, or after extreme events (floods, landslides etc.). The cartographic materials created in the present study allowed us to calculate the active section of the left earthfill dike of the Belci dam, as well as the volume of material removed by the flood of 1991.

J	Yuan, T; Lu, P; Liu, YJ; Ren, F; Zhang, HR				Yuan, Tao; Lu, Ping; Liu, Yijun; Ren, Feng; Zhang, Haoran			Distribution Characteristics and Influence Factors of Carbon in Coal Mining Subsidence Wetland	SUSTAINABILITY												Coal mining subsidence wetlands, as important supplementary resources for wetlands, are of great significance for regulating climate change. This study investigated the distribution and influencing factors of carbon in the overlying water and sediment of coal mining subsidence wetlands in Xuzhou, China, during low-water, high-water, and dry seasons. The results revealed significant spatial and temporal variations in the physicochemical properties of the wetlands, with water hypoxia and a trend toward eutrophication due to excess nitrogen and phosphorus. Dissolved organic carbon (WDOC) and dissolved inorganic carbon (WDIC) in water exhibited opposite temporal trends, while sediment organic carbon (SOC) and dissolved organic carbon (SDOC) showed similar temporal and spatial variations. Inorganic carbon in sediment (SIC) and dissolved inorganic carbon (SDIC) showed consistent temporal changes but significant spatial differences. There was a significant positive correlation between WDOC and SDOC, and WDIC was positively correlated with SDOC and SDIC, indicating the interconnection and transformation of dissolved carbon between water and sediment. WDIC was strongly correlated with water temperature and dissolved oxygen, while WDOC was weakly correlated with the physicochemical properties of water. Overall, these findings contribute to our understanding of the carbon distribution and cycling in coal mining subsidence wetlands, which are crucial supplementary resources to natural wetlands for regulating climate change.

J	Plissner, JH; Haig, SM; Oring, LW				Plissner, JH; Haig, SM; Oring, LW			Within- and between-year dispersal of American Avocets among multiple western Great Basin wetlands	WILSON BULLETIN												Connectivity of discrete habitat patches may be described in terms of the movements of individual organisms among such patches. To examine connectivity of widely dispersed alkali lake systems, we recorded post-breeding and subsequent breeding locations of color-banded American Avocets (Recurvirostra americana) in the western U.S. Great Basin, from 1995-1997. Among individuals observed during the postbreeding/premigratory season, over half of the 188 breeding adults were observed at lakes other than their breeding locations, whereas 70% of 125 post-fledged young were observed only at their natal lake systems. Of 46 breeding adults observed in consecutive years, only eight (17%) dispersed between different lake systems. Only 8% of chicks were observed after their first year, and only 1.3% returned to the natal area in subsequent breeding seasons. Adult and recently fledged birds from the southernmost breeding site were regularly observed in post-breeding aggregations at lakes several hundred kilometers to the north, suggesting seasonal differences in habitat quality at the lake systems studied. These results indicate the importance of maintaining habitat fur post-breeding movements.																			0043-5643					SEP	1999	111	3					314	320																WOS:000082106000002

Assessment of cardinal temperatures of Egeria najas Planchon and its potential growth in a tropical floodplain lagoon	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Knowledge of the factors controlling the growth of macrophytes is essential to forecasting their spatial distribution and management. Based on growth rates (mu), this study describes the cardinal temperatures of Egeria najas, and evaluates its growth potential. Cultures at 4 temperatures (15, 20, 25 and 30 degrees C) were monitored for 48 days. Plant growth was fitted to a logistic model to obtain growth rates (mu(15): 0.02; mu(20): 0.05; mu(25): 0.10; mu(30): 0.04 day(-1)) which were used for parameterization of the optimal temperature function, obtaining the cardinal temperatures (lower basal temperature: 5 degrees C; optimum temperature: 26.3 degrees C; upper basal temperature: 31.7 degrees C). Using the water temperature of the Oleo Lagoon (a tropical floodplain lagoon from which E. najas was harvested) and optimum temperature function, the seasonal variation of the E. najas mu was calculated. This procedure predicted that the highest mu are expected between September and April (rainy season); however, on average, the mu was higher between April and October (dry season). Although the temperature is of paramount importance for the growth of this species (Q(10): 4.39), in aquatic environments with small thermal variations, turbidity and nutrient scarcity can decisively interfere with the growth of submerged macrophytes.

J	Freitas, H; Diamond, M; Semkin, R; Gregor, D				Freitas, H; Diamond, M; Semkin, R; Gregor, D			Contaminant fate in high Arctic lakes: Development and application of a mass balance model	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Steady- and unsteady-state models based on the QWASI fugacity/aquivalence approach and describing chemical fate in high Arctic lakes were developed and applied to Amituk and Char Lakes on Cornwallis Island, NWT, Canada. The model considered characteristics of Arctic lakes, such as water and chemical throughflow, development and depletion of ice cover, and temperature dependence of physical-chemical properties. The model of Char Lake was parameterized and calibrated with literature data for phosphorus, and for Amituk Lake, data were obtained from the Amituk Lake project, focusing on Sigma DDT. Model results indicate that Arctic lakes act as conduits, not sinks for chemicals. Most loadings are from snowmelt that enter via stream inflow and most is exported from the lake; minimal amounts of chemicals volatilize or are retained in sediments. Burial is restricted by low-suspended particle concentrations that convey chemicals to the sediment. An attendant implication of the low-suspended particle concentrations is that nearly all chemicals remain in the dissolved phase in the water column. Consequently, chemical persistence is mainly controlled by water retention time which, for these small lakes, is several years. The illustrative unsteady-state model shows seasonal effects on chemical processes such as cryoconcentration that may increase water column concentrations by up to 15% in early May.

Standing biomass and production rate estimates were made using estimates of size-specific dry weights and development times obtained from laboratory measurements, field observations and information found in the literature. Both mysid and copepod are capable of a rapid response to favourable conditions and have high rates of birth, growth and production. E. affinis reproduces throughout the year with an estimated annual (May 1988-May 1989) production of 20 g dry wt m(-2). Copepod standing biomass was less in 1989 compared with 1988 owing to an overall reduction in copepod body-size and a reduction of size at maturity. There was a suggestion from the data that this was caused by predation from a greater number of large (>9 mm body-length) mysids in 1989 compared with 1988. N. integer is highly seasonal in its growth with distinct peaks of recruitment in May and July. Annual (May 1988-May 1989) production of the mysid was estimated as 5.8 g dry wt m(-2). Although E. affinis is the only available prey of N. integer in the lake, the mysid population appears independent of changes in that of the copepod and probably avoids negative predator-prey feedback mechanisms owing to an ability to feed on epiphytic algae.

J	ARNDT, JL; RICHARDSON, JL				ARNDT, JL; RICHARDSON, JL			TEMPORAL VARIATIONS IN THE SALINITY OF SHALLOW GROUNDWATER FROM THE PERIPHERY OF SOME NORTH-DAKOTA WETLANDS (USA)	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Several studies have shown the important role of groundwater recharge and discharge on the geochemical development of salinity in prairie wetlands and hydric soils; however, none have focused on the effects of transient groundwater mounding on the accumulation and mobilization of salts within, and between, wetlands. The present study examines temporal variations in the salinity of pondwaters, and near-surface groundwaters collected from hydric soil profiles in brackish to subsaline, semipermanent North Dakota wetlands, and places these variations in a geo-hydrological context. Groundwater samples were collected periodically from extractor nests in the peripheral, shallow-marsh zone of the wetlands. Pondwaters were collected from locations near each extractor nest. Standard methods were used to characterize salinity, soil, and the saturation status of calcite and gypsum in pondwater and goundwater. All extractor locations had coarse-textured surface sediment overlying finer textured subsurface sediments. The electrical conductivity of groundwaters collected from extractors in coarse-textured surface sediments was usually highest after drawdown and steadily declined after recharge events. Groundwaters collected from fine-textured subsurface sediments were much less variable in EC compared with coarse-textured surface sediments. The greatest variation in the saturation status of calcite and gypsum was associated with pondwater and groundwater from coarse-textured surface sediments that contained little or no observable amounts of these minerals. Zones containing identifiable calcite and gypsum were usually saturated with respect to these minerals. Zones of gypsum accumulation in particular were fine textured and below the level associated with normal seasonal water fluctuations. Our results indicate that temporal and spatial salinization patterns in near-surface groundwaters and pondwaters are dynamic in semipermanent prairie wetlands, and are closely related to transient recharge events. Electrical conductivity and gypsum distribution patterns in groundwaters and sediments at the extractor locations indicate that salt mobilization from the pond edge can be rapid and is primarily by lateral groundwater flow through coarse-textured surface sediments. Salt accumulation and removal is particularly sensitive to the intensity and location of recharge and drawdown episodes.																			0022-1694	1879-2707				JAN	1993	141	1-4					75	105		10.1016/0022-1694(93)90045-B	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-1694(93)90045-B													WOS:A1993KK97000004

Analyses of allele frequency data from samples of nonspawning walleyes taken in Lake St. Clair provided conditional maximum likelihood estimates that 86% of these walleyes were from Lake St. Clair and 14% from Lake Erie (SD = 19.7%) in 1983 and that 63% were from Lake St. Clair and 37% were from Lake Erie (SD = 20.0%) in 1984. About 30% of 1,159 recoveries of walleyes tagged in Lake Erie were taken from the Detroit River northward to southern Lake Huron, thus demonstrating extensive mixing of stocks from Lake Erie and Lake St. Clair. Additionally, tags recovered from the upper half of the St. Clair River provided an estimate of mixed stock composition of 76% Lake St. Clair fish and 24% Lake Erie fish. Analyses of tags returned during successive spawning seasons showed that walleyes strongly tended to return to suspected natal spawning areas. The tagging data thus corroborate the genetic evidence that walleye stocks from Lake St. Clair and Lake Erie are different, and that large numbers of Lake Erie walleyes enter Lake St. Clair during nonspawning seasons and return to their Lake Erie spawning sites each year. Western Lake Erie and Lake St. Clair walleyes should be considered as separate stocks for management purposes.																			0380-1330						1993	19	2					445	452		10.1016/S0380-1330(93)71231-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(93)71231-9													WOS:A1993LN30700023

In Australia, where TBE is common, vaccination has been shown to reduce the incidence considerably. Since this vaccine is now available in Sweden we analysed 1116 cases of TBE from 1956 to October 1989 in order to define a strategy for vaccination. The cases were identified in the records from all infectious disease departments in Sweden complemented with data from the virological laboratories. All diagnoses were confirmed by a positive serological result. The analysis shows TBE to be concentrated to the archipelagos and coastline areas of the Baltic and the lake Malar around Stockholm-about 85% of all cases came from the county of Stockholm. Conspicuous clustering occurred in some areas and the geographical distribution was remarkably constant over the time studied. As can be expected with a tick-borne infection, a strong seasonal variation was found, 85% of the cases occurring July to September. The age distribution showed the highest incidence from 20-70 years; there was a male majority in all age groups. Five patients died.																			0036-5548	1651-1980					1990	22	3					287	295		10.3109/00365549009027050	http://dx.doi.org/10.3109/00365549009027050								2371544					WOS:A1990DJ38100006
J	Qu, WC; Su, CW; West, RJ; Morrison, RJ				Qu, WC; Su, CW; West, RJ; Morrison, RJ			Photosynthetic characteristics of benthic microalgae and seagrass in Lake Illawarra, Australia	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Lake Illawarra, is a typical shallow intertidal coastal barrier lagoon in New South Wales, Australia. This paper reports the first examination of photosynthetic characteristics of benthic microalgae and seagrass in this lake by measuring the oxygen exchange procedure (flux) using sediment-core incubations in the laboratory. Photosynthesis vs irradiance relationships (P-I curves) were generated from measurements made at nine irradiances for microphytobenthos (MPB) at five different water depths (sites) during September 2002. Maximum benthic gross primary production (GP(max)) for MPB in this lake tended to decrease with the increasing water depth from Site 5 (about 0.2 m deep) to Site 1 (about 3.0 m deep), and was correlated with decreasing surface sediment Chl-a concentrations. However, when GP(max) was normalized for chlorophyll a content (GP(max)(B)) (values from 8.72 to 16.41 mg O-2 mg(-1) Chl-a h(-1)), the trend was less evident. Benthic microalgal populations showed values of sub-saturated photosynthetic efficiency (alpha(B), 0.13 to 0.54 mg O-2 mg(-1) Chl-a h(-1) (mumol m(-2) s(-1))(-1)) and light saturation oneset parameters (I-k, 17.1 to 102.0 mumol m(-2) s(-1)), respectively. alpha(B) tended to decrease with decreasing water depth. while Ik was greater in association with shallow (as compared with deep) water sediments. However, the differences between sites were not always significant. Relationships among P-I parameters and environmental variables, and possible photoacclimation of MPB in this lake were studied using correlation coefficient matrices. A strong positive relationship existed between Ik and bottom irradiance (I-Z) (r = 0.77, P < 0.01). I-k was also significantly correlated., negatively, with alpha(B) (r = -0.87, P < 0.01), and water depth (r = -0.79, P < 0.01). These observations are consistent with adaptation of the microphytobenthos to lower light levels, indicating benthic microalgal photoacclimation in Lake Illawarra. Based on the factor analysis technique, principal components score plots were obtained to cluster the data (14 samples from 5 sites). It was found that samples with similar P-I or environmental characteristics were clustered together. In addition, the seagrass meadows (Site 6) exhibited significantly higher rates of benthic respiration and light saturated primary production capacity than MPB during the sampling period. The values for GPmax, aB and Ik measured for the seagrass in Lake Illawarra were 2.02 mg O-2 mg(-1) Chl-a h(-1), 0.03 mg O-2 mg(-1) Chl-a h(-1) (mu mol m(-2) s(-1))(-1) and 74.7 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), respectively; these values are comparable with those reported in the literature.

The analog method is based on comparisons of distributions of charcoal accumulation rates from annually laminated sediments using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample D statistic (D). D is a non-parametric statistic expressing the difference between distributions that does not require assumptions concerning the shape of the distributions (e.g. normality, homoscedasticity) and it summarizes differences in a single index. Our study consists of (i) mapping D values obtained by comparisons between pairs of 'reference' charcoal series from the immediate presettlement (calibration) and (ii) identifying possible presettlement analogs from this reference set for Late Quaternary charcoal distributions. Our calibration analysis identified geographic transitions in charcoal transition that were much steeper than apparent from pollen data. Otherwise, geographic patterns in presettlement charcoal and pollen are comparable, including a group of oak/hardwood forest sites in Wisconsin, central Ontario, and New York having similar values, and another group of mostly northern hardwood/hemlock sites in Pennsylvania and Maine. Application to charcoal series dated after 11000 yr BP at Wisconsin and New York suggests that fire regimes may have been different from those occurring at any of our reference sites. Differences in seasonality of climates and different fuel structures are a possible explanation.

The phytoplankton and several environmental parameters in the upper part of the lake were monitored at a mid-lake station, from 1988 to 1997. The specific composition of the community changed during this period, from a predominantly pennate-diatom phytoplankton (Asterionella formosa, Fragilaria crotonensis), the lake passed to dominance by a sparse, motile nanoplankton (Mallomonas akrokomos, M. caudata, Cryptomonas erosa, Chroomonas/Rhodomonas, a.o.) and then by large colonies of small-celled species (Uroglena americana, Dinobryon spp., Radiocystis geminata, Aphanothece clathrata, Coelosphaerium kuetzingianum a.o.). This paper describes the algal successions involved and shows the decisive effects of the decrease of trophic level from an eutrophic stage to an oligo-mesotrophic condition. In the beginning, externally imposed disturbances (flooding and dewatering) were frequent, while now the lake has stabilised as a deep, stratified pelagic system. Under these conditions, autogenic phytoplankton appear to dominate.																			0018-8158					APR 15	2000	424						39	49		10.1023/A:1003992609507	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003992609507													WOS:000088483000005
J	URABE, J				URABE, J			STABLE HORIZONTAL VARIATION IN THE ZOOPLANKTON COMMUNITY STRUCTURE OF A RESERVOIR MAINTAINED BY PREDATION AND COMPETITION	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The zooplankton community of the Ogochi Reservoir was investigated with brief field experiments to examine the mechanisms that maintain a stable horizontal distribution of species in the warm-water season. Daphnia galeata predominated near the dam site, and its abundance declined toward the headwaters. The abundance of other species increased away from the dam, and Bosmina longirostris was found abundantly at the site near the headwaters. Demographic analysis and field experiments demonstrated that D. galeata had the potential to depress the abundance of other species through exploitative competition and to predominate at sites near the headwaters as well as at the dam site. This potential was never realized, however, at a site near the headwater because of a high mortality rate that could not be explained by food abundance or physical and chemical conditions in the water. The invertebrate predator Leptodora kindtii was abundant at sites nearer the headwaters, but its occurrence was limited temporally. Trammel gill-net samples revealed that planktivorous fish, which prey selectively on the superior competitor D. galeata and the invertebrate predator L. kindtii, were distributed toward the headwaters in the warm-water season. The high mortality rate of D. galeata at the site near the headwaters apparently was attributable to predation by fish. The data presented demonstrate that the pelagic environment in the reservoir is functionally heterogeneous and that species interactions play an important role in maintaining the stable horizontal pattern in the community structure.

The samples were collected in one of the lakes located next to ceramic industries in Santa Gertrudes, S5o Paulo state in the southwest region of Brazil during the rainy season. In order to determine the concentration of bioavailable metals (mobile fraction) and metals that are representative of the geological matrix (residual fraction) in sediment samples, procedures of acid extraction were implemented. All measurements were carried out in the Synchrotron Light Source Laboratory (LNLS), located in Campinas, SAo Paulo state. For sample excitation, a polychromatic beam of approximately 2 mm (width) and 0.3 mm (height) was used, and for the detection of the characteristic X-rays produced, a Si(Li) detector was employed. The net areas of the X-ray peaks were obtained from the program (Quantitative X-ray Analysis System; QXAS). The elements V, Cr, Co, Cu, Zn and Pb, which are considered to cause higher environmental damage, showed high availability. The concentrations of these elements are above the reference values which correspond to soil protection and underground water quality of Sdo Paulo state. The concentrations obtained indicate that the area in study is contaminated. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A body size approach to understanding Holocene seal hunting at Lake Baikal in Siberia	ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Baikal seals (Pusa sibirica) are a unique freshwater pinniped that inhabits Lake Baikal in the interior of Eastern Siberia. These seals were critical resources for human groups living along the lake through at least the Holocene. This study develops osteometric methods for assessing Baikal seal body size, including body mass and nose-tail length. This was accomplished through the analysis of biometric and osteometric data for 354 modern Baikal seals. The resulting methods can be expediently used to estimate seal body mass and length. Using these methods, we explore seal use at Sagan-Zaba II, a habitation site on Lake Baikal with deposits spanning much of the past 9000 years. These analyses reveal a general preference for smaller-bodied seals, particularly during the Middle Holocene, and a paucity of larger individuals in the assemblage.

Based on stomach content and d(13)C and d(15)N stable isotope analyses, we conducted a comprehensive study of the diet of the fish community and its trophic structure in subtropical Lake Zacapu in central Mexico. Overall, there was good agreement between the results based on the diet and the isotope analysis. Fish diets consisted mainly of aquatic macroinvertebrates, which were abundant in the lake. Most species were secondary consumers and trophic generalists across the four sites and two seasons. The food web structure did not differ significantly between the sites or seasons. Our results suggest a low trophic position of native species having a wide spatial trophic niche and niche width. Trophic diet overlap was greater between native species (especially between species from the same family) than between non-native species. Our study provides new information on the trophic interactions in a subtropical lake, rich in endemic species and an important resource for human communities.					; Jeppesen, Erik/O-2667-2019; Moncayo-Estrada, Rodrigo/AFO-3255-2022; Jeppesen, Erik/A-4463-2012	, Omar/0000-0001-9583-4443; Mercado-Silva, Norman/0000-0001-7764-8161; Ramirez-Garcia, Arely/0000-0002-1818-638X; Jeppesen, Erik/0000-0002-0542-369X														2073-4441				APR	2023	15	7							1301	10.3390/w15071301	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15071301													WOS:000970435000001

Three factors, i.e., the contribution rate of the rainfall in the flood season, the rainfall frequency, and the maximum daily rainfall, were selected to determine the optimal probability distribution function for each single factor. Furthermore, the root mean square error goodness-of-fit test was used to determine the optimal copula function for the three-dimensional joint probability distribution characteristics of the rainfall factors. The research results show that the three-dimensional copula joint probability method contains much more information than the results of the single variable probability calculation. The copula function can be used to analyze the multi-dimensional joint distribution of rainfall factors, which can fill the gap in research on multiple rainfall factors.

It has implications for the growth of diatoms and dinoflagellates and studying the processes that control the dissolution, precipitation, and biological uptake of different silicates species can provide an understanding of the occurrence of toxic blooms. This study examines the seasonal distribution of monomeric and polymeric silicates in the brackish and freshwater lakes of Japan. Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy was used to detect and quantify total dissolved silicates (TSi) and the spectrophotometric molybdenum blue method was used to detect molybdate reactive silicates (monomers to tetramers). The difference between the concentrations obtained via these two methods was used to determine the concentrations of polymeric silicates. Polymeric silicates were detected in anoxic-reducing pore waters from sediments of the freshwater Lake Biwa and Lake Kawaguchi in Japan, with a maximum concentration of 0.42 mmol L-1. Polymeric silicate was continuously detected as long as the lake bottom environments remained under anoxic-reducing conditions. It provides insights on the formation mechanisms of polymeric silicates in freshwater lakes. The polymerization of silicates is understood to occur during the adsorption reaction between monomeric silicates and Fe(OH)(3) precipitate. Furthermore, this polymerization is deemed to be a dehydration condensation reaction because the silicates adsorbed on Fe(OH)(3) precipitate are situated at short distances from each other. In the anoxic-reducing environments, these monomeric and polymeric silicates are released from ferric hydroxide (Fe(OH)(3)) precipitate by reacting with hydrogen sulfide.

Palaeo-lake Congo, hypothetically, would have been the greatest of Africa's Mio-Pliocene lakes, making a significant contribution to cloud cover and precipitation in the equatorial zone, year-round, as well as north and south of that zone as the ITCZ migrated seasonally. Interpretation of the climatic significance of the lake and its subsequent demise continue to be hampered by lack of information on the timing and progression of geologically recent physiographic changes that led to the present-day hydrology of the basin.																			2372-5907		90-5809-350-6				2001	27						11	18																WOS:000173048100003

It was only in August when we could see all three of the well-known gyres described by Suda et al. (1926). The biggest counter-clockwise gyre named "the first gyre" was formed in June and disappeared in November. The first gyre was initially located in the north part of the North Basin, and then moved to the south as temperature stratification in the upper layer became stronger. It returned to the north again as the stratification weakened. It is suggested that the movement of the first gyre can be related to the seasonal or annual difference in heating intensity. We also found that the second and the third gyres were not stable, and that these gyres vary in their position and size according to the wind field.																			0938-0949		0-87590-268-5				1998	54						199	208																WOS:000079137400014
J	DUNN, PO; HANNON, SJ				DUNN, PO; HANNON, SJ			INTRASPECIFIC COMPETITION AND THE MAINTENANCE OF MONOGAMY IN TREE SWALLOWS	BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY												Intraspecific competition for access to breeding resources may limit male mating success in typically monogamous birds. We examined the potential for intraspecific competition to limit polygyny in tree swallows at Beaverhill Lake, Alberta, Canada. In this population, polygynous males raised more fledglings than monogamous males, and there was little or no cost to females from nesting polygynously. Under these conditions one might expect polygyny to be more common than that observed (8% of males). We found that females were most aggressive toward conspecific intruders early in the breeding season. This aggression was associated with (1) females settling farther apart than expected under random settlement, (2) later settlement by secondary than by monogamous females, and (3) no relationship between female settlement date and male territory size instead of the negative correlation expected if females settled randomly without competition. Early in the season, males also settled farther apart than expected if they had settled randomly, and among males with two or more nest boxes on their territory, males with widely separated nest boxes were more likely to be polygynous. Monogamy is probably the most common pairing association in this population because intraspecific competition for nest sites prevents most males from gaining a territory with nest sites far enough apart to permit two females to breed without one female excluding the other. Females appeared to be defending an area surrounding their nest box to limit nest usurpation or intraspecific brood parasitism, rather than to limit any loss of male parental care from polygyny.

Statistical difference was found in the concentration of Al, As, Ca, Cd Cu, Fe, Mn, N,Ni, P, Pb, S, and Zn in the aspen foliage. Particulates on the leaves surfaces and in the stomata at the three sites include Al, Ga, Fe, Si, Mg, Ma, S, Th, Ti and Y. These elements are typical for particles from industrial sources. Fungi effect was observed on leaves from all localities. Differences in epicuticular wax structure, as determined by scanning electron microscopy were found between these sites with the most severe impact being found at the Kenosha site. These include severe erosion of waxes, and occlusion of stomata. The results; suggest that O-3 pollution of the Kenosha and Kalamazoo site show significant negative impact on epicuticular waxes of aspen and that these impacts are the most severe on the O-3 sensitive clones.																			1335-342X						1999	18	2					200	210																WOS:000080591100010

A survey of acidified streams in the Loch Ard area of The Trossachs, Scotland, was carried out between 1986 and 1988, to determine the influence of physical and chemical factors on the distribution of benthic algae. Samples were taken on thirty-five occasions from fifteen sites on ten streams. Forty-nine operational taxa of filamentous algae were distinguished. Relative abundance of taxa in samples was scored on a seven-point scale. Estimates of standing crop were made by pigment extraction and ash-free dry weight (AFDW) determination from biomass developed on artificial substrata. 2. No evidence was found for seasonality in standing crop, nor for an increase in standing crop with a decrease in pH. Seasonality in relative abundance was evident for few taxa. Species richness and diversity were highly correlated with pH and correlated chemical variables. 3. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) carried out using the CANOCO program ordinates species and sites and relates them directly to environmental variables. The most important variable was found to be pH (or an acidification-related variable that is highly correlated with pH), with percentage forest cover and total oxidized nitrogen being of secondary importance. The effect of subdividing the data set, using data based on presence-absence as well as estimated relative abundance, was tested. A comparison of the effects on the distribution of site and species values on the pH vector showed that the results are robust, confirming the value of this semi-quantitative sampling method for use with a difficult algal group. It was possible to infer pH from algal community structure using CANOCO. 4. The pH ranking of species derived from CCA revealed that larger cell diameter taxa do not predominate at low pH, implying that reduction of invertebrate grazing was not an important determinant of algal community composition.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				OCT	1993	30	2					301	317		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1993.tb00811.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1993.tb00811.x													WOS:A1993MF40100011

Nonlinear water clarity trends and impacts on littoral area in Minnesota lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY LETTERS												Lake water clarity is an indicator of water quality, trophic status, and habitat condition. Changes in clarity impact lake ecosystems and may reflect land use changes or presence of invasive species. Quantifying temporal changes in water clarity can be challenging because clarity varies seasonally, annually, and spatially within and among lakes. We developed a hierarchical generalized additive model to quantify trends in water clarity (Secchi depth) from 1979 to 2018 for 909 Minnesota lakes, accounting for seasonal and spatial variability. Water clarity increased by 0.41 m across lakes from 1984 to 1988 and 2014 to 2018. Lake-specific clarity trends varied: clarity did not change significantly in 59.0% of lakes, increased in 34.5% of lakes, and decreased in 6.5% of lakes. Water clarity dynamics caused considerable variability in littoral area between seasons and years. Our results have wide applications in aquatic ecology, including understanding changes to food webs, assessing fish habitat, and evaluating impacts of invasive species.					; Hansen, Gretchen/ABE-3860-2022	Hansen, Gretchen/0000-0003-0241-7048; 														2378-2242				AUG	2023	8	4					657	665		10.1002/lol2.10323	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lol2.10323		MAR 2023											WOS:000953007800001

The monthly composite time series compiled by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) provides a valuable data source that deserves to be more widely known and applied in regional studies. This paper presents examples of time series of Canadian coastal waters compiled for each month from September 1997 to December 2001 for the west coast of Canada (British Columbia), the Great Lakes, and the east coast of Canada (Gulf of St. Lawrence and Newfoundland - Grand Banks). The time series show the seasonal and interannual variations of phytoplankton surface concentration and the occurrence of major bright plankton blooms on the B.C. coast, in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and on the Grand Banks. In addition, "bright-water" events are shown in Lake Erie and Lake Michigan. Many cases also occur where the reflectance of large areas of water is increased by sediment from rivers or resuspended bottom sediment. The data show the value of a consistent time series of satellite data, both for single-band radiance products and for the derived chlorophyll data. In particular, the water brightness data show significant events that do not appear to have been reported in the scientific literature.																			0703-8992	1712-7971				FEB	2004	30	1					26	35		10.5589/m03-049	http://dx.doi.org/10.5589/m03-049													WOS:000189216800005

In this study, we simulated the spatial distribution of atmospheric benzo[a]pyrene (BaP, the most carcinogenic PAH) in the YRD in 2016 and 2030 under different emission scenarios using a 3-D atmospheric transport model and evaluated the lung cancer risks posed by BaP during the study years. The purpose of this study is to suggest targeted policy recommendations for policy-makers to mitigate BaP pollution through numerical simulation. Our results showed that the average BaP concentration in the YRD was 0.30 ng/m(3) in 2016; however, a significant spatial variation was observed, with the highest BaP concentration in Shanghai (0.59 ng/m(3)). The population-weighted incremental lifetime lung cancer risk (PILCR) was 6.67 x 10(-6) in 2016, whereas it ranged from 2.70 x 10(-6) to 1.05 x 10(-5) in 2030 under the five emission scenarios. A higher future population density in the YRD region could increase lung cancer risk. In all scenarios, Shanghai had the highest number of lung cancer cases (range: 208-476). The results suggest that BaP pollution could be effectively improved through the synergistic effect of reducing activity levels and improving technology. Finally, we provide specific suggested pollution control strategies (e.g., accelerating the use of clean energy in rural areas) for atmospheric BaP in the YRD. [GRAPHICS] .

J	ALI, A				ALI, A			PERSPECTIVES ON MANAGEMENT OF PESTIFEROUS CHIRONOMIDAE (DIPTERA), AN EMERGING GLOBAL PROBLEM	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOCIATION												In recent years, adult Chironomidae emerging from some urban natural or man-made habitats have increasingly posed a variety of nuisance and economic problems, and in some situations medical problems to humans in different parts of the world. Although there are an estimated 4,000 or more species of chironomid midges worldwide, less than 100 species have been reported to be pestiferous. Among midge control methods, numerous laboratory and field studies have been conducted on the use of organochlorines, organophosphates (OPs), pyrethroids and insect growth regulators (IGRs). Field use of OP insecticides such as chlorpyrifos, temephos and others in the USA and Japan has generally resulted in larval control for 2-5 wk or longer with application rates below 0.56 kg AI/ha (USA) and < 1-5 ppm (Japan). Frequent use of some OP insecticides in the USA and Japan has caused their increased tolerance in several midge species. The IGRs, diflubenzuron and methoprene, provide alternate means for midge control. These IGRs in some situations suppressed adult midge emergence by > 90% at rates < 0.3 kg AI/ha. A number of parasites and pathogens have been reported from midges in different parts of the world. Bacillus thuringiensis serovar. israelensis is effective against some midge species, but at rates at least 10 x or higher established for mosquito larvicidal activity. The flatworm, Dugesia dorotocephala, and some fish species offer a good potential for midge control in some situations. In large habitats covering hundreds or thousands of ha, information on the basic ecology of larval midges and adult behavior is essential for formulating midge control criteria. More research is needed on the biological and physical and cultural control of these pestiferous insects.

Using NASA equation, at satellite temperature is derived from 29 Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-7 ETM+ images obtained from 1994 to 2004, and was compared with in situ surface temperature on river-type dam lakes such as Paro, Chuncheon, Euiam, Chongpyong, Paldang, and with 10m-depth temperature on lake-type dam lake Soyang. Although the in situ temperature at the time of satellite data acquisition was interpolated from monthly measurements, the number of images with standard deviation of temperature difference (at-satellite temperature-in situ interpolated temperature) less than 2 degrees C was 24 on which a novel statistical atmospheric correction could be applied. The correlation coefficient at Lake Soyang was 0.915 (0.950 after correction) and 0.951-0.980 (0.979-0.997 after correction) at other lakes. This high correlation implies that there exist a mixed layer in the shallow river-like dam lakes due to physical mixing from continuous influx and efflux, and the daily and hourly temperature change is not fluctuating. At Lake Soyang, an anomalous temperature difference was observed from April to July where at-satellite temperature is 3-5 degrees C higher than in situ interpolated temperature. Located in the uppermost part of the Han river system and its influx is governed only by natural precipitation, Lake Soyang develops stratification during this time with rising sun elevation and no physical mixture from influx in this relatively dry season of the year.

Diurnal time-activity budget and habitat use of Whooping Cranes (Grus americana) in the reintroduced Louisiana nonmigratory population	WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												Time-activity budget studies provide valuable insights for better understanding animal behavior relative to spatial and temporal habitat use. We examined a reintroduced, nonmigratory Whooping Crane (Grus americana) population to determine how time-activity budgets change relative to crane age, sex, habitat type, and season. Our study area encompassed natural marshes and working wetlands primarily in southwestern Louisiana. From June 2012 to January 2016, we conducted continuous focal sampling on individuals (n 1/4 27) from the first 4 captive-reared cohorts released in the state. We classified age groups as juveniles, subadults, and adults, and identified 5 main habitat types utilized by cranes in Louisiana: crawfish ponds, rice fields, agricultural levees/farm roads, fallow fields, and natural wetlands. On average, cranes spent approximately 53% of their diurnal time-activity budget foraging. Maintenance/rest (28%), vigilance (12%), locomotion (6%), and other/unknown (2%) behaviors accounted for the remainder of the time observed. Foraging most frequently occurred in fallow fields and crawfish ponds where cranes likely encountered greater invertebrate biomass and density. Cranes tended to spend less time foraging and more time on maintenance as they aged, which could indicate agedependent differences based on experience on the landscape. Vigilance levels were not significantly affected by age, but males tended to be more vigilant than females. As this young population continues to mature, additional study of breeding pairs and family groups may elucidate other behavioral differences in response to the dynamic habitat conditions in the region.

They are widely distributed and rich in organic matter. In this study, samples were observed under the optical microscope and FESEM, combined with geochemical test and physical property analysis to study the sedimentary characteristics and reservoir characteristics of them. Nine lithofacies are recognized based on the mineral composition, the content of organic matter and the beddings. The middle-high organic laminated calcareous fine-grained sedimentary rocks (LF1) and the middle-high organic laminated mixed fine-grained sedimentary rocks (LF2) resulted from seasonal sediment variations and settled by suspension in the deep lake. The middle-high organic flaggy mixed fine-grained sedimentary rocks (LF3), the middle-high organic flaggy calcareous fine-grained sedimentary rocks (LF4), the middle-high organic massive calcareous fine-grained sedimentary rocks (LF5) and the middle organic massive mixed fine-grained sedimentary rocks (LF6) were formed by redeposition. The low organic massive argillaceous fine-grained sedimentary rocks (LF7), the low organic massive felsic fine-grained sedimentary rocks (LF8) and the low organic massive mixed fine-grained sedimentary rocks (LF9) are affected by the terrigenous input events. The pore structures vary in different beddings which are influenced by the kinds and arrangement of minerals and particles. In the laminated lithofacies, the ink-bottle-shaped pores are dominant. In the flaggy and massive lithofacies, the ink-bottle-shaped pores and the slit-shaped pores coexist. LF1 and LF2 are the best target for shale oil exploration and the LF3, LF4, LF5 and LF6 are the second. The deposition processes control the lithofacies and reservoir characteristics of the fined-grained sedimentary rocks.																				1996-1073				MAR	2023	16	5							2200	10.3390/en16052200	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en16052200													WOS:000948267000001

Presmolt growth rate explained a significant but small proportion, 16% for steelhead and 6% for coho, of the variation in growth rate in seawater. The relationship between presmolt and postsmolt growth rate was positive for steelhead and slightly negative for coho. In steelhead trout, the relationship between freshwater and seawater growth rate was not affected by male parental type (steelhead or domesticated rainbow trout). In coho salmon, however, the slope of regression was affected by differences among family groups. These results demonstrate variable relationships between presmolt and postsmolt growth rate among salmonid species and families, suggesting that fast presmolt growth is not necessarily associated with fast seawater growth in hatchery-reared salmonids. These findings are of interest for rearing procedures in smelt hatcheries and for models predicting optimal time and size for migration in wild smelts.																			0706-652X					FEB	1997	54	2					430	433																WOS:A1997XB78700018

In this study, we modeled wetland inundation as a random spread process and used random sets to characterize stochastic properties of water body extents. Periodicity, trend and random components were captured by monthly and yearly random sets that were derived from multitemporal images. The Covering-Distance matrix and related operators summarized and visualized the spatial pattern and quantified the similarity of different inundation stages. The study was carried out on the Poyang Lake wetland area in China, and MODIS images for a period of eleven years were used. Results revealed the substantial seasonal dynamic pattern of the inundation and a subtle interannual change in its extension from 2000 to 2010. Various spatial properties including the size, shape, position and extent are visible: areas of high flooding risk are very elongated and locate along the water channel; few of the inundation areas tend to be more circular and spread extensively; the majority of the inundation areas have various extent and size in different month and year. Large differences in the spatial distribution of inundation extents were shown to exist between months from different seasons. A unique spatial pattern occurred during those months that a dramatic flooding or recession happened. Yearly random sets gave detailed information on the spatial distributions of inundation frequency and showed a shrinking trend from 2000 to 2009. 2003 is the partition year in the declining trend and 2010 breaking the trend as an abnormal year. Besides, probability bounds were derived from the model for a region that was attacked by flooding. This ability of supporting decision making is shown in a simple management scenario. We conclude that a random sets analysis is a valuable addition to a frequency analysis that quantifies inundation variation in space and time. (C), 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	HANSSON, LA				HANSSON, LA			FACTORS INITIATING ALGAL LIFE-FORM SHIFT FROM SEDIMENT TO WATER	OECOLOGIA												In enclosure and whole-lake experiments, I tested whether life-form shift (recruitment) is a passive process induced by turbulence. a seasonal phenomenon. or a behavior that can be induced by alterations in environmental variables. The number of algal cells recruited from the sediment varied considerably during the experimental period. The most important migrating genera in this study were: Cryptomonas, Dinobryon, Gonyostomum, Gymnodinium, Peridinium, and Synura. An obvious conclusion is that it is not the same factor in each case that causes life-form shift, but that different triggering factors operate in different algal species. Turbulence and temperature were similar in all treatments and therefore did not cause the considerable fluctuations and trends in algal recruitment in the enclosures. This suggests that life-form shift is not a passive process driven by wind and temperature-induced currents. In the enclosure experiment, alterations in the light regime explained a major part (up to 53%) of the variation in recruitment for most genera. For Gymnodinium this was corroborated in the whole-lake experiment, where the depth of the euphotic zone explained 41% of the variation in recruitment. For Gymnodinium, however. 64% of the variation in recruitment was explained by the depth of the ''oxycline'', whereas 52% of the variation in recruitment of Synura were explained by the depths of the euphotic zone and the oxyline. Peridinium pusillum and P. wisconsinense showed low recruitment at high zoo-plankton abundance and high recruitment at low zoo-plankton abundance in the lake experiment, as well as in the enclosure experiment. Thus, the hypothesis that the presence of grazers can induce shifts in behaviour of some algal groups cannot be rejected.					; Hansson, Lars-Anders/HCI-2735-2022	Hansson, Lars-Anders/0000-0002-3035-1317; 													0029-8549					MAY	1993	94	2					286	294		10.1007/BF00341329	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00341329								28314044					WOS:A1993LE06100019

In the lake water, natural radionuclides contaminate with a certain level, as a result of atmospheric deposition, groundwater diffusion, soil erosion, and sediment-water-air interaction. In this study, K-40, Ra-226, and Th-232 were analysed for surface soil and water in a specific quarry lake in Vietnam. The seasonable variation of radioactivity in water was investigated. It was found that the activity concentration correlated with the TDS of water and the higher activity concentration was found in the wet season. The RUSLE model was used to predict the average annual rate of soil erosion in the study site. Based on the model prediction, the inflow rate of K-40, Ra-226, and Th-232 in water were 4.73, 36.75, and 768.5 GBq y(-1) respectively.

AQUATIC LIVING RESOURCES												Reproduction parameters of a landlocked population of black-chinned tilapia Sarotherodon melanotheron have been studied for 2 years and compared to literature data obtained from their natural environment. Sex-ratio (year 1: 1:2.69; year 2: 1:1.96) is in favour of females and shows seasonal variations. Males mature earlier (year 1: 129 mm SL; year 2: 126 mm SL) than females (year 1: 135 mm; year 2. 136 mm SL). Gonad maturation cycle is continuous. All these results are generally similar to those obtained in the natural environment. However, a lower fecundity is noted in Lake Ayame. Accordingly, an increase in oocyte diameter is observed. The average condition factor in the lake ranges between values observed in lagoon populations and therefore indicates a good adaptation of this species to fresh water conditions.

The main goal of the modelling work is to estimate the role of main factors affecting water currents in Lake Tanganyika and to understand the peculiarities of spatial and temporal variations of its hydrophysical characteristics. Special attention is given to a more accurate description of wind-induced shear stresses, the main driving force of the lake dynamics. Numerical experiments with a mesoscale meteorological model show the significant role of a coastal diurnal slope-lake breeze system, intensified during the dry season while south-easterly trade winds supply the main amount of energy to the middle of the lake.																			0018-8158					JUL	1999	407						25	35		10.1023/A:1003758003034	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003758003034													WOS:000083710100003

Increasing concern over climate change projections has prompted numerous crop-based studies on the possible agricultural implications. It is not possible to evaluate sustainability without understanding the interactions between the influence of climatic trends, host resistance, cultural interventions and fungicide efficacy in relation to late blight risk. The objectives of this case study were to report the potential impact of climate change on late blight epidemiology in potatoes. Analysis of historical data from 1948-1999 indicated that late blight risk over a standardized growing season from 1 May-30 Sep increased in the Upper Great Lakes region of the US. Predominant genotypes of P. infestans (e.g. US8) in the US appear more tolerant of temperatures close to 0degreesC and their survival in warming conditions may explain their supremacy. As conditions become increasingly favorable for late blight development it is essential to reduce sources of initial inoculum through integrated approaches that include prediction of conditions conducive to late blight development and appropriate application of controls.																			0567-7572	2406-6168	90-6605-707-6				2004		638					37	42		10.17660/ActaHortic.2004.638.3	http://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2004.638.3													WOS:000223697400003
J	Hartke, KM; Hepp, GR				Hartke, KM; Hepp, GR			Habitat use and preferences of breeding female wood ducks	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Female wood ducks (Aix sponsa) feed primarily on plant foods in the prelaying period and switch to a diet of mostly invertebrates during egg production. If nutrient acquisition is habitat-specific, then selection and use of habitats may differ between these reproductive stages. A better understanding of these processes is needed to assist future habitat conservation and management efforts. In January-May 1999 and 2000, we monitored movements and habitat use of radiomarked females (n = 47) during the prelaying and egg-production periods of first nests. Home-range size averaged 367 ha and did not vary with reproductive period, year, or female age. Habitat use did not differ between periods of prelaying and egg production; consequently, data were combined. Habitat use varied between years, female age, and periods of nest initiation (i.e., early vs. late). Use of beaver ponds (BP), temporary wetlands (TW), managed impoundments (MI), and take habitats (LK) declined in 2000 compared to 1999, possibly due to reduced precipitation. Nest initiation date was independent of female age. Adult females used BP more than yearlings, and early-nesting females used BP and MI more than late-nesting females. Females selected habitats nonrandomly when habitat composition of the study area was compared to that of home ranges (second-order selection). Lake-influenced wetlands (LI) and MI were ranked highest in preference. Home-range size was inversely related to percentage of the home range comprised of MI and LI, supporting the idea that MI and LI were high-quality habitats. However, we found no relationship between nest initiation date (an important index to reproductive performance) and the combined area of MI and LI in home ranges. Habitat selection did not differ from random when habitat composition of home ranges was compared to that of radio locations (third-order selection). Although MI and LI were preferred, high-quality habitats, our results suggest that breeding female wood ducks can satisfy requirements for egg production using a variety of wetland habitats. We suggest that providing a diversity of habitat types will increase the probability of meeting needs of breeding females throughout the breeding season, especially in areas where wetland conditions frequently change.																			0022-541X	1937-2817				JAN	2004	68	1					84	93		10.2193/0022-541X(2004)068[0084:HUAPOB]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.2193/0022-541X(2004)068[0084:HUAPOB]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000188243400008

The presence of H. littorale was documented from early 2002 to late 2003 in Lake Tohopekaliga (Kissimmee River Basin) in central Florida. In this paper, 22 H, littorale nests and nest sites are described. The characteristic bubble nests were present from late May to early September, with number of nests peaking in August when water stage and temperature were both high. Nest habitats (shallow, open marshes) and timing of nest construction (rainy season) were similar to what has been reported for H. littorale in its native range. Most nests (n = 14) were in areas dominated by Hydrilla verticillata and constructed largely from parts of this Asian aquatic plant, representing a unique association between two non-native species. Nevertheless, during August, as water levels increased, nesting shifted from H. verticillata-dominated communities to use of inshore grass zones dominated by Luziola fluitans. Knowledge of H. littorale nesting seasonality and habitat preferences may be useful for any efforts to control or manage this invasive fish.																			1528-7092						2004	3	3					451	466		10.1656/1528-7092(2004)003[0451:NANHOT]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1656/1528-7092(2004)003[0451:NANHOT]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000224226800007

A few rare species were found as well as a single specimen of a presumed new gastropod taxon. Only two species of unionids, Pyganodon cataracta and Elliptio complanata, were found within the drainages. The largest drainage system, Popolopen Brook, contained the highest diversity of molluscs. Species redundancy between drainages aligned well as a function of the extent of lentic and lotic habitats with brooks and streams having a Bray-Curtis similarity index of approximate to 64.0 when compared to lakes and ponds. On the other hand, a number of species collected were found in only a single drainage. Total drainage area did not correspond well with diversity unless determined as total predicted usable habitat. Thus the drainages with the greatest number of discernible lakes, ponds, streams, and creeks, also had the highest molluscan diversity. On the whole, molluscan diversity of these drainages compared favorably to those of other regional New York sites, but relative abundance or population densities varied, with variations reflecting survey effort, time or season of collections, and incorporation of historic museum collections.																			1092-6194	1938-5307					2004	11	3					273	294		10.1656/1092-6194(2004)011[0273:FMOTUS]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1656/1092-6194(2004)011[0273:FMOTUS]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000223967300004

In the past, it has invaded wet and sunny areas such as flooded pasture, canals, river banks and along roadsides causing problems to traffic, irrigation and cultivation activities of farmers. More recently, mimosa has invaded some national parks. One of them, Tram Chim National Park, is a Ramsar Wetland, and the biggest wetland conservation zone in Vietnam. It is facing serious threat from mimosa. At Tram Chin National Park, unmanaged mimosa has increased in area from 150 ha in 1999 to 490 ha in 2,000 and 1,000 ha in 2001. Other national parks and lakes in the north, like Cuc Phuong and Thac Ba, are threatened due to the spread of mimosa in the flooding season. These infestations are causing a decline in plant and animal populations. In response to invasion by mimosa, the National Institute of Plant Protection has conducted research on physical, manual, biological and chemical control measures since 1995. This paper reviews the current status of mimosa invasion, its impact on the ecosystem, and the control measures employed, with the emphasis on herbicide application, in Vietnam.

The size distribution of each species was examined. Each species makes its first appearance in the ecosystem during different months of the year although there are periods during which the simultaneous presence of some species is observed. L. aurata occurred first (beginning of the year), followed by L. ramada and later on in May by C. labrosus. L. saliens occurred in July and finally M. cephalus in October. The highest abundance and recruitment rate was observed for C. labrosus.

Analysis of the historical wind direction record from Mt John identifies airflow from three principal directions to most frequently affect the study area. Both seasonal and diurnal trends in the frequency of each directional category are identified, which reflect the influence of local thermal forcings and seasonal changes in synoptic circulation on the Lake Tekapo windfield. Meteorological observations from a network of automatic weather stations and anemographs within the study area identified Lake Tekapo to generate its own circulation system, a lake/land breeze. This combines with the larger scale valley wind, which during ideal conditions continues after sunset in the upper reaches of the lake catchment. During light to moderate foehn northwesterly conditions, the combined lake breeze/valley wind system remains decoupled from the prevailing synoptic airstream. Towards evening when local thermal circulations weakened, a channelised foehn airstream often becomes dominant over the entire field area. Observations made during this investigation have a number of applied implications with respect to air pollution dispersion modelling and forecasting within alpine lake basins.					; McGowan, Hamish/AAD-9607-2021	Sturman, Andrew/0000-0002-2103-3616; 													0177-7971						1996	58	1-4					165	177		10.1007/BF01027563	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01027563													WOS:A1996TJ67600012

J	Xu, YH; He, YX; Pang, JL; Sun, YG				Xu, Yanhong; He, Yuxin; Pang, Jiali; Sun, Yongge			Seasonal constraints on the burial of organic carbon in the eutrophic Lake Taihu	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE												Eutrophication alters the function of lake ecosystems through phytoplankton blooms and is a major contributor to organic carbon (OC) burial in lakes worldwide. Although Lake Taihu is notable for its severe eutrophication yet low OC burial, why cyanobacteria-derived OC is ineffectively buried in the lake is unknown. Because seasonal hydrological and ecological dynamics in eutrophic lacustrine ecosystems would significantly modify the preservation and degradation behaviors of OC, seasonal variations in paired particulate samples from both the water column and surface sediment are critical in evaluating cyanobacteria-derived OC burial. In this study, we present the steroid results of water and sediments collected from Meiliang Bay in Lake Taihu across cyanobacteria-bloom and decay seasons (from May 2018 to June 2019) to investigate constraints on the seasonal burial of autochthonous and allochthonous OC. The results indicate that cyanobacteria contribute a considerable amount of OC to the water body in the cyanobacterial bloom season, while terrestrial OC becomes the main contributor during the cyanobacterial decay season. Although OC degradation occurs throughout the water column, substantially more OC degradation was observed at the water-sediment interface. The extensive degradation of OC in the bloom season eventually reverses the seasonal distribution characteristics of particulate OC in the water column, leading to less accumulation of OC under the background of higher cyanobacteria-derived OC input. The combined effect of OC bioavailability, temperature, oxygen exposure, and more importantly microorganism activities, accounts for much higher OC degradation rates in the bloom season. Similar phenomena were observed in subtropical shallow lakes with high primary productivity, suggesting that eutrophication might have a limited influence on OC burial when compared to other factors related to OC degradation.

Energy Budget, Water Quality Parameters and Primary Production Modeling in Lake Volvi in Northern Greece	SUSTAINABILITY												A lake's water quality and its ecosystem structure are mainly determined by heat storage change through its energy budget, dissolved oxygen, nutrients and primary productivity. A one-dimensional water quality model for lakes was used to estimate temperature, dissolved oxygen, phytoplankton (as chlorophyll-alpha), and inorganic and organic phosphorus. Evaporation, energy budget and surface water temperature were also computed. The results of the mathematical model simulation are presented and evaluated. Data from Lake Volvi in Central Macedonia (in northern Greece) for three successive years (2013 to 2015) were used to calibrate and recalibrate the model. The model results of water temperature, dissolved oxygen and primary productivity (Chl alpha) were compared with measurements for the years 2013 to 2015. The comparison showed that the predicted values of these parameters were all in good agreement with the measurements. The simulation results of water quality parameters generally exhibited the same seasonal dynamic and inter-annual variations as the measured data.

J	Guo, WJ; Li, ZQ; Li, C; Liu, BY; Shi, WQ				Guo, Weijie; Li, Ziqian; Li, Cai; Liu, Boyi; Shi, Wenqing			Drainage Ratio Controls Phytoplankton Abundance in Urban Lakes	WATER												Urban lakes located in densely populated regions are highly vulnerable freshwater ecosystems compared to lakes in rural areas due to intense anthropogenic activities. However, the impacts of intrinsic lake morphometry on the water quality of urban lakes remain unclear. In the present study, the water quality of 14 lakes and the underlying factors associated with such quality were explored in Wuhan City, China. Of these surveyed urban lakes, 92.9% were eutrophic or hypereutrophic; phytoplankton biomass ranged between 3.2 and 62.0 mg/L and was positively correlated with drainage ratio values (catchment area/lake area) during the phytoplankton bloom season. These results are consistent with the fact that small lakes associated with a large watershed area generally exhibit high levels of areal nutrient accumulation that rise with the drainage ratio, supporting phytoplankton growth. There were no significant differences in phytoplankton diversity among lakes (p > 0.05), remaining stable at the low Shannon index of 1.9-2.9, which is possibly due to high eutrophication pressure and similar local climatic conditions across the relatively limited study area. Overall, the results of this study will provide a valuable foundation for future efforts to improve water quality management efforts for urban lakes.					wenqing, shi/JCO-4345-2023															2073-4441				FEB	2023	15	4							683	10.3390/w15040683	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15040683													WOS:000942385400001

However, they are easily separated by molecular data; thus, in this work, we attempted to estimate the differences in their spatial and temporal distribution from existing metabarcoding datasets. Reanalyzing published sequences with an ASV-based pipeline and ad hoc classification routine allowed us to estimate the relative abundances of the two species, increasing the precision compared to usual OTU-based analyses. Existing data permit qualitative comparisons between two species that cannot be differentiated by other methods, detecting the distinct seasonal peaks and spatial distributions of F. radians and U. acus.

To compare and evaluate our indoor experiment with outdoor data, we used the simultaneous indoor experiment and field observation approach. The effects of P. crispus growth and decomposition on P concentrations were investigated. P. crispus significantly reduced the P content of different forms in the water during the growth period, and significantly increased the P content of different forms in the water during the decomposition period, according to the findings. As a result, the P level of the water varied seasonally and regularly. The pH and dissolved oxygen (DO) of environmental factors in the water revealed an increasing trend during the P. crispus growth period and a negative trend during the decomposition period. The changing trend of chlorophyll a (Chl-a) and alkaline phosphatase activity (APA) was inverse, decreasing during the growth period of P. crispus and increasing during the decomposition period. In the P. crispus growth environment, all forms of P in water were positively related to Chl-a, APA, and pH, and negatively related to DO. The comparison of the indoor experiment with field data revealed that the indoor experiment number has a larger standard deviation, indicating that the indoor experiment data fluctuated substantially. The indoor simulation experiment has the disadvantage of large data fluctuation. As a result, this study demonstrated that P. crispus regulated the P cycle in water via absorption and changes in environmental factors during the growth period, and released nutrients via decomposition during the decomposition period, thereby influencing the migration and transformation of P in the water. This work may be used as a reference for future research into the process of P exchange between sediments and water interfaces caused by P. crispus.

Thysanoptera specimens were collected with destructive and strike methods in two periods (before and after spike) from each production field during the production season. Thrips specimens were identified based on morphological taxonomic characters. Species distribution maps, species richness, abundance, as well as Shannon-Wiener (H') index, species seasonal dynamic and species sex ratio were calculated to indicate the diversity of Thysanoptera species in the Lakes Region. We also calculated Pearson correlation coefficient to evaluate correlation between Thysanoptera species richness and host plant richness. Species Distribution Modelling, namely MaxEnt algorithm, was used in order to establish the current and future distributional patterns of Thysanoptera species collected in our research area. During the two years of the study, 27,603 specimens of Thysanoptera were collected in production fields of wheat, oat and barley. There were 51 different species from four families. Haplothrips tritici was the most abundant species with 15,284 specimens or 55.371% of all collected. The highest relative abundance within family Thripidae was recorded for Collembolothrips mediterraneus, Chirothrips manicatus, Thrips angusticeps, Thrips herricki and Limothrips cerealium. Considering the altitudinal gradient of the study area, the highest species richness and abundance were found between 950 and 1,050 m.a.s.l. with 40 species and 7,622 specimens recorded. Potential species richness of Thysanoptera revealed an increase in areas that predominantly encompass eastern parts of Burdur province, as well as central north parts of Isparta.					; Uzun Yiğit, Asiye/AGU-6833-2022; Ačanski, Jelena/S-5383-2017; Acanski, Jelena/S-5383-2017; Miličić, Marija/V-7392-2019; DEMIROZER, OZAN/HNC-3417-2023	Milicic, Marija/0000-0002-3154-660X; Acanski, Jelena/0000-0003-1745-6410; 													0013-872X	2162-3236				FEB	2023	130	4					321	338		10.3157/021.130.0401	http://dx.doi.org/10.3157/021.130.0401													WOS:000980381000001

Both the vertical distribution and the distribution among different habitat types were studied by gillnetting with small mesh sized gillnets (8-15 mm) in different habitats. Salmon and trout were predominantly caught in the littoral and sublittoral zones (0-6 m depth). Access to shelter seemed to be the most important factor determining the horizontal distribution of small salmon and trout. Most of these fish were caught in stony or vegetated habitats, while few salmon and trout were caught on sandy locations or in the pelagic zone. In one of the lakes, there were significantly higher catch races of salmon than of trout in the stony littoral (0-3 m), while in the other lake there were no significant differences in spatial distribution between these two species. Charr were primarily found in the profundal, sublittoral or pelagic zones of the lakes.

J	Fraser, G				Fraser, G			Feeding ecology of Forster's Terns on Lake Osakis, Minnesota	COLONIAL WATERBIRDS												At a Minnesota Forster's Tern colony (Sterna forsteri), I investigated the role of seasonal fluctuations of major prey species and measured the feeding rates and types of prey delivered to the colony during 2 critical periods: courtship feeding of females before and after egg formation and feeding of chicks (at various stages). Mean courtship feeding rates were 0.7 (1992) and 1.3 (1993) feedings/h, with rates generally higher during the evening. There was a significant decline in courtship feeding rates after egg laying. Chicks less than 1-2 weeks old were fed 2.3 fish/h, but this decreased to only 1.4 fish/h at 3 weeks. As chicks aged size of the terns' prey increased significantly from 3.3 cm (week 1) to 5.2 cm (week 3). The most abundant species of fish seined at selected feeding areas was the spottail shiner (Notropis hudsonius) in 1992 and yellow perch (Perca flavescens) in 1993. The main species of fish brought back to the colony were yellow perch, shiners (Notropis spp.), and sunfish (Lepomis spp.). Forster's Terns are primarily piscivores; when available, yellow perch are easily captured and therefore more often consumed in freshwater areas.																			0738-6028						1997	20	1					87	94		10.2307/1521767	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1521767													WOS:A1997WW85700011

Samples were filtered on-site or at the field-lab to retain the suspended particulates. Some of the samples were passed through XAD-2 columns to extract dissolved PCBs, depending on total samples volume and logistical consideration. Concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were measured in both the particulate and dissolved fractions. Concentrations ranged from < 5 to 22 ng/L (average = 10 ng/L) in the particulate, and from < 5 to 13 ng/L in the dissolved fractions. The average ratio of dissolved PCB concentration to particle-bound PCB concentration was 0.6; the calculated average total PCB concentration was 17 ng/L. Annual mass transport of PCBs through the Trenton Channel in 1995 was estimated to be 600 kg, with potential point sources along the west shore of the channel contributing less than 1.5% of the total mass of PCBs. A general seasonal trend was observed, with lowest PCB concentrations in March and greatest in July. Concentrations following a significant rainfall increased within the first 24 hr and decreased to approximate ambient levels after 96 hr. In general, PCB concentrations appear to be greater downstream than upstream, however, this trend was reversed for Day-1 of the rainfall events, perhaps due to greater particulate loading from upstream of the channel. Potential point-sources from industrial or municipal waste-water treatment outfalls showed PCB concentrations up to a factor of 4 greater than those from the transects in the channel. However, the annual loading of PCBs to the channel. Dissolved concentrations of PCBs determined by C-18 Empore disks were 4.7-fold greater than those determined by XAD-2 (s.d. = 1.5, n = 4). Further investigations validating this finding are necessary. For this reason, comparisons among different studies must be done with caution.

J	Paredes, JM				Paredes, Jose Matildo			Analogs in the study of fluvial successions: Conceptual framework and examples from the Chubut Group (Cretaceous) of Argentina	JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES												This review presents the theoretical framework of the use of analogies in science, and within the hydrocarbon industry in particular, and develops several approaches employed to study the continental successions of the Cretaceous Chubut Group of the Golfo San Jorge basin (Argentina). The Cretaceous Chubut Group was preserved in an endorheic basin that changed its basin configuration, boundaries, and alluvial organization through its deposition. The study of fossil analogs is presented through the compilation of geometrical data of fluvial channel deposits that belong to the Matasiete (Aptian), Castillo (Albian), and Bajo Barreal (Cenomanian-Turonian?) formations, currently exposed along the San Bernardo Fold Belt. The database reflects the occurrence of (several) multichannel drainage catchments with ribbon to narrow sheet channel geometries mainly in a high-accommodation setting, whose temporal and spatial variations in fluvial processes and alluvial styles were regulated by its (paleo)geomorphological position, overimposed to climatic and tectonic signals. In addition, the finding of current analogs of productive channel belts within the Mina del Carmen Formation (Albian) has been explored through seismic geomorphology, empirical relations derived from current rivers, and global databases of river discharge and area of the drainage catchments. Current analogs of endorheic basins in a seasonal climate occur in the south-central of Africa (Okavango Macrobasin) and central-northwest of Africa (Lake Chad basin). Both endorheic basins contain several drainage catchments of variable orientation with multiple source areas, variable development of fluvial processes (ephemeral, strongly seasonal, perennial) regulated by the overall patterns of precipitation and temperature distribution within the drainage catchments, and multiple base levels (lacustrine, ephemeral pans) in hydro-logical basins changing between fully integrated, partially-connected or disintegrate according to the water availability. Both analogs record significant changes in the size of the lakes and ephemeral pans through their evolution, regulated by the overall re-organization of the drainage catchments by river capture and climatic cycles; comparable features have not been recognized within the Chubut Group in the subsurface of the Golfo San Jorge basin until now.					; Paredes, Jose/S-4679-2019	Paredes, Jose Matildo/0000-0002-9942-4908; 													0895-9811	1873-0647				MAR	2023	123								104202	10.1016/j.jsames.2023.104202	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsames.2023.104202		JAN 2023											WOS:000994328500001
J	Dan, TBB; Wynne, D; Manor, Y				Dan, TBB; Wynne, D; Manor, Y			Survival of enteric bacteria and viruses in Lake Kinneret, Israel	WATER RESEARCH												The survival of indicator bacteria (Escherichia coli and enterococci) and polio viruses in Lake Kinneret were studied at different seasons, under various light and oxygen-sulfide regimes. Survival of the bacteria was dependent on environmental conditions, whereas numbers of polioviruses (pfu) were high for all the seasons studied. A large discrepancy was often noted between the methods to determine bacterial numbers (plate counts on selected media and direct counts). Under certain conditions, bacterial plate counts dropped, even though the direct counts remained the same or increased. These ''inactive'' or non-culturable cells were still viable, since glucose uptake activity was not impaired in such bacteria. Inactivation of E. coli appears to be initiated by light, although sulfide also renders the cells non-culturable. Survival patterns of E. coli and polioviruses in the lake were similar, suggesting that for the Kinneret, at least, E. coli is a better indicator of fecal pollution than the enterococci.

Ion-rich mine waters can disturb the seasonal mixing of lake waters, even leading to permanent stratification, i.e. meromixis. In this study, we investigated two small natural lakes receiving waters from closed Ni-Cu mines. To characterize the present chemical and physical conditions of these two boreal lakes, we collected water samples and in-situ water column measurements seasonally in 2017 and 2018. We modelled the stability of meromixis in the lakes under varying physico-chemical and meteorological conditions with the MATLAB-based open-source model code, MyLake. Chemical analyses and water column measurements show that both lakes are currently meromictic with a chemocline separating the circulating, well-oxygenated upper water from the non-circulating, hypoxic bottom water. The main anion was SO4 in both lakes, while the main cations were Ca, Mg, Na, and K. Elevated concentrations of conservative elements flowing from the mine areas are crucial in maintaining the meromixis. Modelling scenarios suggest that the meromixis would be sustained for several decades even if the external load ceased completely. Lake morphology and sheltered surroundings also seem to contribute to maintaining the meromixis in these lakes. Consequently, our results indicate that small headwaters are sensitive to persistent meromixis even when external loading is mild.					; Juntunen, Janne/B-9892-2015	Kehusmaa, Karoliina/0000-0001-7888-5898; Juntunen, Janne/0000-0001-5593-3850; Saarni, Saija/0000-0003-2050-3062													1025-9112	1616-1068				MAR	2023	42	1					24	39		10.1007/s10230-023-00915-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10230-023-00915-9		JAN 2023											WOS:000918946300001

Eighteen haplotypes were detected in 144 fish. Significant differences were found between seasonal races of sockeye salmon spawning in the lake. The short time of independent divergence between the seasonal races indicates that these races formed independently in each spawning region. No difference in mtDNA between lake samples of early sockeye salmon (subisolates) was revealed, which confirms the existence of gene flow between them. A high level of differences between the sockeye salmon spawning in the lake and spawning in the tributaries of the lake, the Bushuev and Lotnaya rivers, suggests that there were no migration between them during many generations and that the nature of spawning grounds ( lake or river) is essential for within-species differentiation in this species.

We tested the hypothesis that N supply could limit production of E. crassipes during the growth season by adding NH4+ or PO43- during 1 month to large in situ enclosures. Those enclosures amended with N produced twice as much biomass as the controls and P-treated enclosures. The low and limiting N content (1.3% AFDW) of the control and P-treated plants provide a first diagnostic value for N deficiency in the field for E. crassipes. N limitation in these lakes may be attributable to high P supply from Andean rivers, high losses of macrophyte N during floods, and the unstable nature of floodplain lakes.

Humic substances were isolated from surface lake waters in each season by the XAD extraction method and their carbon isotopic ratios were measured by accelerator mass spectrometry. The Delta C-14 values of Biwa humic and fulvic acids indicate that these substances consist mainly of pre-bomb C-14. There is a negative correlation between Delta C-14 and delta C-13 values for the Biwa fulvic acids. The fulvic acid consists of younger organic materials with lower delta C-13 value in January, but older organics with higher delta C-13 in April and October. The major part of fulvic acid may be supplied from soil solution and/or groundwater in the watershed and their contribution varies with season. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Evaluation of preservation protocols for oxygen-sensitive minerals within laminated aquatic sediments	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS												Laminated sediments can record seasonal changes in sedimentation of material from anoxic waters, including minerals of the redox-sensitive elements Fe, Mn, and S that form under varying oxygen levels, mineral saturation conditions, and from microbial metabolism. However, preserving the oxygen-sensitive minerals for identification is challenging when preservation of the spatial arrangement of laminae is also required. In this study, we compare methods for embedding sedimentary materials from anoxic waters and sediments from Brownie Lake, Minnesota, USA for analysis of the speciation for Fe, Mn, and S using synchrotron-based X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES). We found that acetone dehydration and resin replacement in a 100% N-2 glovebox successfully preserved the speciation of Fe and Mn minerals within laminated sediments. However, acetone removed some sulfur species from sediments, and epoxies contained sulfur species, which challenged identification of native sulfur species. Results from this study will aid researchers who are interested in spatial analysis of oxygen sensitive sediments, soils, or microbial mats in choosing a preservation method.

Two sets of experiments were carried out during the low-water and high-water season to determine bottom-up and top-down regulation of phytoplankton growth rates. Nutrient addition assays indicated that phytoplankton was primarily limited by N during both the high-and low-water season. Measurements of phytoplankton growth rates at different depths in the lakes indicated photoinhibition close to the water surface and slightly negative growth rates below 1 m depth. Incubations of phytoplankton in the presence and absence of mesozooplankton indicated no significant grazing pressure of mesozooplankton. Microzooplankton grazing rates determined using dilution experiments were low (about 0.2 day(-1)). Nevertheless, given the low in situ growth rates of phytoplankton due to nutrient limitation, this grazing impact was not negligible. Nutrient-deletion dilution and grazing experiments indicated that phytoplankton growth rates were supported by internal and external nutrient pools rather than by nutrients recycled by micro-or mesozooplankton.

Although suckers in the pond ingested invertebrates > 215 mu m they never ingested detritus particles > 215 mu m Suckers fed pond detritus in laboratory aquaria selectively ingested the fine particle fraction (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, p < 0.0001). Suckers excluded particles > 220 mu m and ingested a median particle size of 54 mu m Amorphous detritus particles comprised 100% of the detritus particles in 93% of the foreguts analyzed. Suckers fed fine particle (< 45 mu m) pond detritus in laboratory aquaria rejected the inorganic fraction and selectively ingested organic material with the highest protein and energy content. Ash free dry mass (AFDM) as a percent of dry-mass was 2.6 times greater in the foregut contents than in the detritus (p < 0.001). The amino acid concentration and energy density of the ingested organic matter were 1.9 times higher (p < 0.044) and 1.3 times higher (p < 0.025) than the respective amino acid and energy content of the organic fraction of the detritus. These results indicate that suckers have the capacity to consume selectively fine particle detritus with the highest nutritional value.																			0378-1909					AUG	1996	46	4					375	381		10.1007/BF00005016	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00005016													WOS:A1996UZ70200007

Settlement and the exploitation of aquatic resources in the Eastern Lower Papaloapan Basin, Veracruz, Mexico	JOURNAL OF ISLAND & COASTAL ARCHAEOLOGY												Research conducted since 2003 in and around the regional center of Tres Zapotes, Veracruz documents the importance of aquatic resources and transportation routes for subsistence and settlement over more than two millennia. Systematic archaeological survey over more than 400 km(2) in the surrounding Eastern Lower Papaloapan Basin details a persistent focus of major settlements on streams and other bodies of water that would have provided an abundance of food and opportunities for water-born transport. Excavations at Tres Zapotes further indicate that exploitation of aquatic fauna was a significant component of a mixed subsistence strategy for the Olmec and Epi-Olmec inhabitants of the site, who obtained fish, turtles, and waterfowl from streams, lakes, estuaries and coastal marine environments over a range extending no less than 20 km from the center. Artifact inventories and landscape features further suggest an associated subsistence technology that included weighted nets and retention ponds in seasonally flooded areas.																			1556-4894	1556-1828				JUL 2	2024	19	3					525	543		10.1080/15564894.2022.2162635	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15564894.2022.2162635		JAN 2023											WOS:000942780800001

Of 230 fish examined, 152 (66%) harboured viable U. Monthly prevalences fluctuated between 12 and 96%; mean intensities ranged from 1.0 to 5.6 L3 per infected fish. Temperature-dependent differences in infection were noted with the prevalence and mean intensity of infection being significantly higher (Chi-Square test and Mann-Whitney-U-test, respectively; P < 0.01) at water temperatures less than 10°C (cold period) than at those above (warm period). These differences remained significant even after the division of fish samples into two size classes (8.5-.10.5 cm, 11-13 cm). Although the paratenic hosts may acquire infections year round, the results suggest that ruffe become infected mainly during the cold season and that the host's feeding ecology determines the final course of infection.

Studies on the physical, chemical, and biological features of the lake have been performed continuously since the 1980s. The lake recovered from eutrophication reaching the present oligotrophic condition. In the last decade, climate change represents the main driving factor for the long-term evolution of the lake, affecting its hydrodynamics, nutrient status, and biological communities. In 2020 a high-frequency monitoring (HFM) system was deployed, with the aim to integrate long-term monitoring based on discrete sampling and analysis. The system consists of a buoy equipped with sensors for limnological variables and algal pigments. The high-frequency monitoring program is part of a cross-border project between Italy and Switzerland focusing on lake quality monitoring as a critical input for successful lake management. In this paper we focus on Chlorophyll-a data, with the aim to test whether in-situ fluorescence measurements may provide a reliable estimate of lake phytoplankton biovolume and its seasonal dynamic. Sensor's performance was regularly tested comparing chlorophyll-a data taken by the in-situ fluorescent sensors (Cyclops7, Turner Design), data from laboratory fluorescence analysis (FluoroProbe, BBE Moldaenke), values obtained from chlorophyll-a analysis by UV-VIS spectrophotometry and data from phytoplankton microscopy analysis. We found a general good agreement between the Chlorophyll-a data obtained with the different methods, confirming the use of in-situ sensors as a reliable approach to measure algal pigments, especially to assess their variability in the short-term, but also to describe the seasonal pattern of phytoplankton biovolume. However, phytoplankton community composition played a substantial role in the performance of the different methods and in the reliability of in-situ data as a tool to assess algal biovolume. This study demonstrates that high-frequency monitoring (HFM), used in conjunction with discrete chemical and biological monitoring, represents an important advance and support in the long-term monitoring of freshwaters and is a useful tool to detect ecological changes. Regular checking and validation of the sensor readings through laboratory analyses are important to get trustworthy data.					; Cancellario, Tommaso/JAC-8395-2023; Tiberti, Rocco/AAM-7103-2021; Musazzi, Simona/AGR-3253-2022; ROGORA, MICHELA/B-9237-2008; ROGORA, MICHELA/IZD-8951-2023; Kamburska, Lyudmila/ABG-2391-2020; Lami, Andrea/F-1415-2013	Tiberti, Rocco/0000-0003-1617-8826; Musazzi, Simona/0000-0001-5549-0084; ROGORA, MICHELA/0000-0003-3515-0220; Kamburska, Lyudmila/0000-0001-5071-6953; Lami, Andrea/0000-0003-3627-0363														2296-665X				JAN 4	2023	10								1058515	10.3389/fenvs.2022.1058515	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2022.1058515													WOS:000926620200001
J	GRYSEELS, B				GRYSEELS, B			THE EPIDEMIOLOGY OF SCHISTOSOMIASIS IN BURUNDI AND ITS CONSEQUENCES FOR CONTROL	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE												This paper summarizes the results of a series of studies on the epidemiology, morbidity and transmission of Schistosoma mansoni in Burundi, and discusses their consequences for control. The main endemic area is the Imbo lowland, consisting of the Rusizi plain, the urban focus of Bujumbura, and the shores of lake Tanganyika; a small, new focus was discovered in the highlands, around lake Cohoha. Distribution studies on 5-10% population samples with duplicate 28 mg Kato smears in these 4 foci showed prevalences of 33%, 26%, 17%, 19% and mean (positive) egg loads of 110, 105, 92, 144 eggs/g, respectively. The combined population at risk was estimated to be 400 000 people, the total number of detectable cases 90 000. Prevalences and intensities varied greatly at the subregional, local and even sublocal level. The age- and sex-related prevalences and intensities of infection showed typical peaks in children and adolescents, but remained relatively high in adults in many areas; these patterns varied from one area to another and could be related to ecology and water contact. Morbidity studies showed that, in children as well as in adults, schistosomiasis-related morbidity such as (bloody) diarrhoea, hepatomegaly and splenomegaly was apparent mainly in areas with prevalences over 30-40%. The intermediate hosts were Biomphalaria pfeifferi (Imbo), B. sudanica (Tanganyika marshes) and B. stanleyi (Cohoha). Population dynamic studies showed strong seasonal variations, the patterns of which were focal and even erratic in space and time. Snail densities and cercarial infection rates (0.85% overall in B. pfeifferi) were low. Behavioural studies showed that human contacts were most frequent in young adults, but their mean duration was highest in children. Most contacts were due to fording and to domestic activities. It is concluded that the most appropriate strategies for control are the following. (i) Targetting priority areas with prevalences over 30%. (ii) Selective chemotherapy based on the presence, not the intensity, of infection in all age groups. (iii) Sanitation aiming particularly at the reduction of fording and domestic water contact. (iv) Focal mollusciciding only in well selected sites. (v) Close monitoring and surveillance.																			0035-9203					SEP-OCT	1991	85	5					626	633		10.1016/0035-9203(91)90371-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0035-9203(91)90371-5								1780993					WOS:A1991GM44600021

This study investigates the species richness and composition, and individual abundance of waterbird assemblages in 10 varzea lakes on the lower Amazon River across a seasonal cycle. A total of 7,970 birds belonging to 52 species were recorded. Of these, 25 species were present in all four phases of the cycle, 5 in three phases, 10 in two and 12 during just one phase. Families with the highest species richness were Ardeidae and Scolopacidae. In the dry season, we recorded the highest species richness and the highest total abundance values. Thirteen species showed variation in abundance across the seasonal cycle, most being more abundant in the dry season Variation in species richness, abundance, and composition suggests that research on waterbird assemblages in Amazonian varzeas should consider all phases of the seasonal cycle. Furthermore, the occurrence of several migratory species demonstrates the importance of this region for the conservation of this group. Multi-year monitoring would contribute to a better understanding of the dynamics of Amazonian varzea waterbird assemblages.

The wide fauna diversity in this area has made it the target of various studies, although for fish species most of them were focused on commercial species. In this work, we carried out the first ichthyofauna species inventory of the Yarinacocha lake, sampling throughout the entire lake during the rainy and dry seasons and considering also all previously recorded species deposited in the Ichthyological Collection of the MUSM with the same locality. A total of 164 fish species were recorded, representing 10 orders (plus Eupercaria), 34 families and 116 genera. Characiformes was the order with more species (68 spp., 41.5%) followed by Siluriformes (59 spp., 36%), Cichliformes (17 spp., 10.5%), and Gymnotiformes (8 spp., 4.9%). The most highly represented families, including almost 55.5% of the total diversity obtained, were Characidae (23 spp., 14%), followed by Cichlidae (17 spp., 10.4%), Loricariidae (14 spp., 8.5%), Pimelodidae (13 spp., 7.9%), Doradidae (13 spp., 7.4%) and Anostomidae (12 spp., 7.3%). From the total fish species recorded in this study, only 22 are considered protected species following the IUCN criteria and 109 species have commercial importance, including 90 ornamental species (54.8%). Our results contribute to the knowledge of the ichthyofauna of the Yarinacocha lake and can be used as a starting point for its conservation and sustainable management over time.					; Ramirez, Jorge/F-4984-2011; Britzke, Ricardo/L-3712-2017; Rodriguez, Daniela/Y-7935-2019; Aylas Hernández, Katia/MAI-3719-2025; Andrade, H./G-8245-2016; Ramirez, Jorge L/F-4984-2011	Nunez Rodriguez, Daniela Lidia/0000-0002-3638-1752; Aylas Hernandez, Katia Milagros/0000-0002-3086-3830; Siccha-Ramirez, Raquel/0000-0002-5597-3948; Britzke, Ricardo/0000-0002-1042-2544; Ramirez, Jorge L/0000-0001-8138-9203													1676-0603	1676-0611					2023	23	1							e20221424	10.1590/1676-0611-BN-2022-1424	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/1676-0611-BN-2022-1424													WOS:000995223200001

A.			The Use of Isotope Indicators in Hydrological Studies in the Taldura River Basin, Central Altai	LED I SNEG-ICE AND SNOW												Stable isotopes investigation was carried out in the territory of the Yuzhno-Chuya Ridge (Central Altai) during the ablation season of 2022. Samples were taken to determine the contribution of meltwater and precipitation to feeding of water bodies. The main research objects are Nekrasov glacier - Tamozennoye Lake system and Taldura River. In the basin of Lake Tamozennoye, the average ice 818O of the Nekrasov glacier (-17.3%) was obtained. Based on the isotopic composition of ice and precipitation, it was estimated that in the stream flowing into Lake Customs, the contribution of glacier meltwater varies from 28 to 67%, on average 54%. For a stream flowing out of a lake, the proportion of meltwater is higher: 48-72, 61% on average. First of all, meltwater enters the lake by filtration through the moraine, and not by surface runoff. Along the Taldura River, delta 18O does not change significantly (delta 18O -16.58 ... -16.84%) for 38 km before the Taldura River confluence into the Chagan River. This indicates the complete predominance of glacier meltwater in the river feeding in the middle of the ablation season. Repeated sampling of water from the Taldura River 5 km from the edge of the glacier showed, that the effect of precipitation can be traced in the isotopic composition of river water, but it does not exceed 20%.

Knowledge of the potential impacts is essential for preparing adaptation measures. Two aspects directly impacted by increasing temperatures are the choice of grapevine varieties and the location of vineyards. To help address these impacts, we analysed future trends in two bioclimatic indices, average growing season temperature (GST) and Huglin's heliothermal index (HI), in the Swiss canton of Neuchatel. We conducted our analysis based on regional climate change scenarios referring to the emission pathways RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Under the assumption of RCP8.5, trends in GST and HI indicate that the climate in this region will become too hot for most grapevine varieties currently cultivated, especially Pinot noir. Moreover, adaptation problems under RCP8.5 are expected to originate from an increase in climate extremes in both temperature and precipitation. Results based on RCP4.5 indicate a broader scope for adaptation, as the climate will remain suitable for a larger number of grapevine varieties within the current altitudinal limits of the Neuchatel vineyards. In theory, an altitudinal shift of Pinot noir would also be possible under this emission pathway. In practice, however, the possibility of establishing vineyards above 600 m would be limited by the presence of protected forests and rocky areas. Our results highlight that vineyards in this region will need important adaptation measures if anthropic greenhouse gas emissions do not decrease rapidly and considerably, limiting the global temperature increase to < 1.5 degrees C.

In the context of recent change with the two last years 2022 and 2023 showing record low Antarctic sea ice extent, high resolution sea ice optical properties are key to understanding the Antarctic sea ice evolution. In this work, we present high resolution surface classification based on the remote sensing Sentinel-2 MSI data. We retrieve sea ice albedo, fraction of blue ice and impurities.

The goal of this study was to assess the concentrations and variability of nutrients in leaf blades and petioles during differing phenological stages and in different vineyards.Methods and key findings The study was conducted in the Finger Lakes region of New York State. Multivariate analysis showed that phenology, tissue type, vineyard site, and year all influence vine nutrient status. Tissue type accounted for more than twice the proportion of variance within the model than site, even though these vineyards consisted of different soil types, ages, rootstocks, and training systems. Within tissue type, leaf blade samples had lower variability than petioles; petiole samples had 30% greater variability in nutrient concentrations than leaf blades. Tissue samples taken at bloom had 66% greater variability than those sampled at veraison.Conclusions and significance The differences in nutrient concentrations among different tissue types and phenological time points underscore the importance of basing recommended nutrient concentrations on specific tissue types and time points. We concluded that nutrient recommendations should be developed based on leaf blade samples to assess vine nutrient status more precisely. Sampling tissue at veraison provided samples with lower variability. However, logistical considerations such as obtaining grapevine nutrient reports with sufficient time to address deficiencies within the current growing season, may be of greater importance to growers. The results within this study may be region-and/or cultivar-specific.

These closed and seasonally open oxbow lakes are subjected to eutrophication, impacting their nutrient concentration and eco-hydrological characteristics. The zooplankton are closely linked with environment throughout their life cycle, hence are a potential indicator of eutrophication. The study examined the assemblage pattern of zooplankton community and trophic state of two ecologically distinct oxbow lakes based on eco-hydrological factors and community structure of rotifers and planktonic crustaceans. Comprehensive trophic state index (mTSI), rotifer trophic state indices (mTSI(ROT)) and crustacean based indices (TSICR) were used to assess the degree of eutrophication. The Kruskal-Wallis test confirmed the heterogeneity in eco-hydrological factors between the oxbow lakes. The studied lakes were in transition from high meso-eutrophic to moderately eutrophic state. The mTSI, mTSI(ROT) and mTSI(CR) for Khalsi (seasonally open) and Akaipur (closed) were 54.90 +/- 11.71, 56.95 +/- 15.64, 59.55 +/- 4.54 and 60.26 +/- 4.48, 55.79 +/- 4.76, 60.00 +/- 4.03 respectively. The Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) revealed NO3-N, water temperature and pH positively impacted abundance of eutrophication indicator species Brachionus and Keratella. An overview of worldwide use of rotifer and crustacean based indices in assessment of TSI has also been discussed. The use of these zooplankton indices to evaluate the trophic status of the ecologically distinct lakes is highly recommended for water quality assessment and management.					; , A.K.Jaiswar/AAE-5769-2022; DAS, BASANTA/JDM-9393-2023; Meena, Dharmendra/KVZ-3197-2024; Puthiyottil, Mishal/KPB-3811-2024; Meena, D.K./KVZ-3197-2024; Kumari, Suman/HIR-2310-2022; SARKAR, UTTAM/K-3247-2019	SARKAR, UTTAM Kumar/0000-0001-8166-4375; Puthiyottil, Mishal/0009-0006-7130-4601; Meena, D.K./0000-0003-3764-6617; Karnatak, Gunjan/0000-0001-7634-1731; 													0277-5212	1943-6246				JAN	2023	43	1							14	10.1007/s13157-023-01658-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-023-01658-7													WOS:000916811300001

I examine the interconnectedness of environmental and personal grief emerging in my fieldwork by Utterslev marsh, a series of interconnected lakes in Northwestern Copenhagen. Through sensory engagements across seasons, changing weather, and unfolding events, embodied memories surface into the present and resonate with/in the ecologies of the marsh. In my fieldwork, I use dance, poetry, performative writing, autoethnography, and memory work inspired by feminist and indigenous approaches to knowledge production. I assemble a framework for conceiving and being-with more-than-human relational time, building on indigenous perspectives and feminist ecological critiques of anthropocentric temporalities. Finally, I discuss how grief work offers potential for commoning and ecosocial transformation: more reciprocal and caring ways of being-together-with(in) environments undergoing loss and destruction.																					978-1-64889-763-4; 978-1-64889-693-4				2023							33	50																WOS:001107440700004

Ice and Snow Thickness of the IGAN Glacier in the Polar Urals from Ground-Based Radio-Echo Sounding 2019 and 2021	LED I SNEG-ICE AND SNOW												Small glaciers of the Polar Urals are at the limits of their existence. Their state and changes serve as an im-portant natural indicator of modern climatic changes. In 2019 and 2021, we performed ground-based radar studies of one of these glaciers, the IGAN Glacier, to measure ice thickness and snow cover. We used Picor-Led (1600 MHz), and VIRL-7 (20 MHz) GPRs. According to these data, the glacier has an average thickness of 49 m, maximum 114 m. The glacier has a polythermal structure: a cold ice layer with an average thickness of 12 m (maximum 43 m), overlaps the temperate ice with an average thickness of 37 m (maximum 114 m in the upper part of the glacier). The volume of ice contained in the glacier (in its studied part) is 14.3 x 106 m3, of which 10.89 x 106 m3 is temperate ice and 3.44 x 106 m3 is cold ice. For comparison: according to the radar data of 1968, the total ice thickness then reached 150 m in the central part, and the thickness of the upper layer of cold ice was 40-50 m. Radar snow gauge survey allowed to build schemes of seasonal snow thickness dis-tribution over the glacier surface in 2019 and 2021, where there is a general spatial pattern of snow thickness growth from 2 m on the glacier terminus to 8 m or more to the rear wall of the corrie, which is due to the sig-nificant influence of avalanche feeding and wind transport. The glacier has lost about 3.2 x 106 m3 of ice per last decade, if the rate of loss continues, it may disappear in 40-50 years. However, this process may have a non-linear nature, as it involves not only climatic factors, but also local terrain features, on the one hand con-tributing to a high accumulation of snow, on the other - the formation of a glacial lake during glacier retreat, which may increase ablation.

J	León-Palmero, E				Leon-Palmero, Elizabeth			Understanding the fluxes of greenhouse gases in reservoirs under the inspiration of Margalef	LIMNETICA												Understanding the fluxes of greenhouse gases in reservoirs under the inspiration of Margalef Reservoirs are significant sources of greenhouse gases (GHG), such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), to the atmosphere. These systems receive and metabolize a larger amount of organic and inorganic carbon and nitrogen from their watersheds than lakes, resulting in the production of CO2, CH4 and N2O. Despite their global relevance, there are still important uncertainties regarding the magnitude, variability and drivers of their emissions that undermine global estimates. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the origin of these emissions is required. Here, I investigate the fluxes of CO2, CH4 and N2O and their concentrations in the water column of twelve Mediterranean reservoirs during the stratification and mixing periods to discern the main pathways involved in their production and the spatial and seasonal variability among these gases and their emissions and radiative forcing. Finally, I provide a theorical framework to understand GHG emissions as a response of reservoirs to eutrophication and external forcing. I integrate Margalef's ideas about how eutrophication perturbs the biogeochemistry of inland waters with the main findings of my previous work to analyze how the C, N and P inputs from reservoir watersheds modify the biogeochemical cycling of C, N, P and O, and determine the production and emission of CO2, CH4, and N2O. This perturbation effect is especially notable for CH4, and N2O emissions, which increase significantly in eutrophic waters, even exceeding the climate forcing of CO2. Therefore, emission of GHG should be seen as part of the reservoir response to the external forcing that displaces a fraction of the materials to the atmospheric boundary.					; León-Palmero, Elizabeth/AFS-0701-2022	Leon-Palmero, Elizabeth/0000-0001-8220-1188; 													0213-8409	1989-1806					2023	42	2					303	328		10.23818/limn.42.22	http://dx.doi.org/10.23818/limn.42.22													WOS:001020939200012
J	Maltese, A				Maltese, Antonino			On the Choice of the Most Suitable Period to Map Hill Lakes via Spectral Separability and Object-Based Image Analyses	REMOTE SENSING												Technological advances in Earth observation made images characterized by high spatial and temporal resolutions available, nevertheless bringing with them the radiometric heterogeneity of small geographical entities, often also changing in time. Among small geographical entities, hill lakes exhibit a widespread distribution, and their census is sometimes partial or shows unreliable data. High resolution and heterogeneity have boosted the development of geographic object-based image analysis algorithms. This research analyzes which is the most suitable period for acquiring satellite images to identify and delimitate hill lakes. This is achieved by analyzing the spectral separability of the surface reflectance of hill lakes from surrounding bare or vegetated soils and by implementing a semiautomatic procedure to enhance the segmentation phase of a GEOBIA algorithm. The proposed procedure was applied to high spatial resolution satellite images acquired in two different climate periods (arid and temperate), corresponding to dry and vegetative seasons. The segmentation parameters were tuned by minimizing an under- and oversegmentation metric on surfaces and perimeters of hill lakes selected as the reference. The separability of hill lakes from their surrounding was evaluated using Euclidean and divergence metrics both in the arid and temperate periods. The classification accuracy was evaluated by calculating the error matrix and normalized error matrix. Classes' reflectances in the image acquired in the arid period show the highest average separability (3-4 higher than in the temperate one). The segmentation based on the reference areas performs more than that based on the reference perimeters (metric approximate to 20% lower). Both separability metrics and classification accuracies indicate that images acquired in the arid period are more suitable than temperate ones to map hill lakes.

Nocturnal surveys of lined seahorses reveal increased densities and seasonal recruitment patterns	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Although the nighttime ecology of organisms remains understudied, nocturnal surveys play an integral part in assessing fish assemblages and the selective forces shaping them. Eleuthera (Bahamas) contains an unusual population of lined seahorses (Hippocampus erectus) in an anchialine lake, possessing morphological characteristics distinct from those found in the ocean. Population surveys for seahorses and their potential predators were conducted at midnight and midday during wet and dry seasons, with belt transects perpendicular to the shoreline that increased in depth away from shore. Nocturnal surveys uncovered seahorse densities 259% higher than daytime transects on average. Sex ratios were consistently male-biased, and the frequency of animals from different reproductive categories varied significantly by time of day, with gravid males observed around the clock but females and nongravid males observed more often at night. Spatial and seasonal recruitment was detected for the first time in this species, with an increase in juveniles detected in the shallow ends of transects during dry season surveys. Juvenile recruitment is poorly understood across syngnathid fishes, so the detection of early recruits at night has broad implications for this fish family. Seahorses from all reproductive categories were perched significantly higher in the water column during the night regardless of their depth or season. Predator densities followed a similar pattern with higher densities observed at night, indicating that elevated nocturnal perch height may be a response to predator presence. However, the selective agents driving these nocturnal behaviors have yet to be identified. Considering H. erectus is listed on the IUCN Red List as "Vulnerable, " the increase in nocturnal population size and the detection of juveniles has crucial implications for understanding their ecology, recruitment, and conservation.					; Mason, Heather/JXM-7254-2024; Rose, Emily/C-9116-2016	Mason, Heather/0000-0001-7171-2919; O'Brien, Duncan/0000-0002-3420-5210; 													2045-7758					JAN	2023	13	1							e9573	10.1002/ece3.9573	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.9573								36644702					WOS:000912199000001

Taking the Eichmann Lake wetland of the Aksu River Basin in Xinjiang as the research area, the temporal-spatial distribution characteristics of the lake and the response of ecological water in recent years were studied based on remote sensing images and monitoring data. The results show that: (1) The water surface area of Eichmann Lake is shrinking, from 61.57 km(2) in 1996 to 27.76 km(2) in 2020. The changes in water surface area have experienced three stages: rapid decline, slow decline, and slow recovery. After the ecological water supply, the water surface area has obvious seasonal changes with hysteresis; (2) In areas with a low average water level, the ecological water supply has a significant impact on the groundwater level. The higher the water supply is, the higher the groundwater level will be. There is a significant lag effect between the change in the groundwater level and the response of the ecological water supply, which is 1-2 months; (3) The response characteristics of different natural vegetation to the ecological water supply were different in interannual, seasonal, and spatial contexts. The response of Populus euphratica to the ecological water supply is obvious, and its growth is the best within the range of 100-500 m from the water supply outlet. This research can provide the basis for the rational allocation of the Aksu River Basin's water resources, and also act as a valuable reference for the restoration and reconstruction of surrounding vegetation in the Aksu River irrigation area.

J	Prasertphon, R; Chaichana, R; Jitchum, P				Prasertphon, Rawipa; Chaichana, Ratcha; Jitchum, Pailin			Seasonal variation of zooplankton assemblages and their responses to water chemistry and microcystin content in shallow lakes in Thailand	ARCHIVES OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												This study examines zooplankton assemblage structure and density from five hypereutrophic urban shallow lakes between cool and hot periods in 2018-2019. We analyzed the variation of zooplankton and their relationship with environmental factors. Samples of zooplankton were collected from shallow lakes in different regions of Thailand. Four groups of zooplankton were identified, of which Rotifera was the most abundant group, followed by Copepoda, Protozoa, and Cladocera. Zooplankton assemblages were influenced by seasons, as indicated by multidimensional scaling analysis. The number of species and density of zooplankton were lower during the cool period than during the hot period. The increased density of zooplankton in the hot period may have been due to increased phytoplankton density as food sources. Pearson's correlation coefficient revealed that Rotifera and Copepoda positively correlated with the temperature and pH, and Rotifera was negatively correlated with total phosphorus; a negative correlation was also observed between Protozoa and dissolved oxygen. The microcystin content tended to have a negative impact on specific small species such as Protozoa (Coleps sp.). Information from this research is important for further study involving factors affecting the size structure of zooplankton communities, especially large-bodied species in tropical regions.																			0354-4664	1821-4339					2023	75	4					369	378		10.2298/ABS230618029P	http://dx.doi.org/10.2298/ABS230618029P													WOS:001125519500003
J	Rull, V; Sigró, J; Vegas-Vilarrúbia, T				Rull, Valenti; Sigro, Javier; Vegas-Vilarrubia, Teresa			PRESENT CLIMATE OF LAKE MONTCORTES (CENTRAL PYRENEES): PALEOCLIMATIC RELEVANCE AND INSIGHTS ON FUTURE WARMING	CUADERNOS DE INVESTIGACION GEOGRAFICA												The varved sediments of the Pyrenean Lake Montcortes (Pallars Sobira, Lleida) embody a unique continuous high-resolution (annual) paleoarchive of the last 3000 years for the circum-Mediterranean region. A variety of paleoclimatic and paleoecological records have been retrieved from these uncommon sediments that have turned the lake into a regional reference. Present-day geographical, geological, ecological and limnological features of the lake and its surroundings are reasonably well known but the lack of a local weather station has prevented characterization of current climate, which is important to develop modern-analog studies for paleoclimatic reconstruction and to forecast the potential impacts of future global warming. Here, the local climate of the Montcortes area for the period 1955-2020 is characterized using a network of nearby stations situated along an elevational transect in the same river basin of the lake. The finding of statistically significant elevational gradients for average temperature and precipitation (-0.59 & DEG;C and 82 mm per 100 m elevation, respectively) has enabled to estimate these parameters and their seasonal regime for the lake site. The estimated average annual temperature is 9.7 & PLUSMN;0.8 & DEG;C and the estimated total annual precipitation is 1031 & PLUSMN;34 mm, in average. A representative climograph has been shaped with these data that can serve as a synthetic descriptive and comparative climatic tool. The same analysis has provided climatic data for modern-analog studies useful to improve the interpretation of sedimentary records in climatic and ecological terms. In addition, the seasonal slope shifting of the climatic elevational gradients has been useful to gain insights about possible future climatic trends under a warming scenario.					; Rull, Valentí/B-9783-2008; Vegas-Vilarrúbia, Teresa/B-2973-2008; Sigro, Javier/L-2329-2017	Rull, Valenti/0000-0002-9961-105X; Vegas-Vilarrubia, Teresa/0000-0001-9136-136X; Sigro, Javier/0000-0003-0969-0338													0211-6820	1697-9540					2023	49	1					23	38		10.18172/cig.5412	http://dx.doi.org/10.18172/cig.5412													WOS:001033614700002
J	Shrestha, MK; Ranjan, R				Shrestha, Madhav K.; Ranjan, Rahul			Territory and status of dolphins in Nepalese rivers: A review	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Nepal is endowed with vast water resources in form of glaciers, lakes, streams and rivers. All the rivers in Nepal are connected to the Ganges River system of India. The major rivers are reliable sources of water and provide habitats for aquatic animals, opportunities for hydropower, and irrigation development in downstream regions. The major rivers of Nepal include the Koshi, Gandaki (Narayani), Karnali, and Mahakali which all drain from north to south. These rivers support abundant wildlife species as well as a number of fishes, amphibians and reptiles. Most relevant to this paper is the Ganges River Dolphin (Platanista gangetica gangetica Roxburgh, 1801). The Ganges River Dolphin preys on fish, mollusks and other aquatic animals. Being a migratory species, the dolphins move from larger rivers to their tributaries, seasonally. This paper is intended to review work on the status of Ganges River Dolphin in Nepalese rivers based on secondary data obtained from different published surveys targeting the dolphin populations. The records show the Karnali River has the largest population, followed by the Koshi and Narayani rivers, with no record of dolphins occupying the Mahakali River in recent years. Recent surveys estimate about 100 dolphins living in Nepal, with 80 estimated in the Karnali River. Different anthropogenic activities including construction work, intensive fishing, pollution and the lack of conservation planning for dolphins have resulted in a decline in number from historic levels. The presence of this aquatic mammal is considered as an indicator of the overall health of the river system. The COVID-19 pandemic and lock down might have caused increased dolphin sightings. Additionally, high pre-monsoon precipitation in recent years have caused higher water levels in smaller rivers, possibly causing the dolphins to return earlier than usual to the major river systems. They were recorded to be present in the Mohana and other small tributaries of the Karnali River as early as first week of June.

Iron and Manganese Oxidation States, Bonding Environments, and Mobility in the Mining-Impacted Sediments of Coeur d'Alene Lake, Idaho: Core Experiments	HYDROLOGY												The mobility of a metal in mining-impacted sediments is determined by the environmental conditions that influence the metal's oxidation state and bonding environment. Coeur d'Alene Lake, USA, has been impacted by legacy mining practices that allowed the hydrologic transport of mining waste to the lakebed, resulting in substantial amounts of redox-sensitive Fe and Mn along with Ag, As, Cd, Cu, Hg, Pb, Sb, and Zn. Future lake conditions may include algal blooms and additional algal detritus at the sediment-water interface, which may alter Fe and Mn forms that can influence their, and other metal(loid)s, mobility during seasonal anoxia. Cores of the lakebed sediments were exposed to anoxic and anoxic + algal detritus conditions for 8 weeks. Sediment samples were collected biweekly for analysis of Fe and Mn oxidation states and bonding environments by synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Over the 8-week period and at a location 12.5 cm deep in the sediments, anoxic and anoxic + algae conditions produced limited changes in Fe and Mn oxidation states and bonding environments. At a location 2.5 cm below the sediment-water interface, the anoxic condition promoted a relatively stable environment in which Fe and Mn oxidation states and bonding environments did not vary greatly during the experiment. At the 2.5 cm depth, the anoxic + algae condition substantially altered the Mn oxidation state distribution and bonding environment, but this condition did not strongly influence the Fe oxidation state distribution or bonding environment. The anoxic + algae condition increased the presence of Mn3+, produced Mn4+ at select times, altered the Mn bonding environment, and temporarily increased the release of Mn into porewater. The algae influence on sediment and porewater Mn likely occurred because of the increased formation of organo-Mn complexes produced during algae-enhanced enzymatic processes. The lack of influence of algal detritus on sediment and porewater Fe and the formation of soluble organo-Mn complexes may limit the potential increase in the mobility of other metal(loid)s with future lake conditions.

OBJECTIVE: This study presents a verification of the numerical Weather Research and Forecasting non-hydrostatic Mesoscale Model (WRF NMM) for weather prediction using the High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster over the complex relief of Montenegro. METHODS: Verification was performed comparing WRF NMM predicted values and measured values for temperature, wind and precipitation for six Montenegrin weather stations in a five-year period using statistical parameters. The difficult task of adjusting the model over the complex Montenegrin terrain is caused by a rapid altitude change in in the coastal area, numerous karst fields, basins, river valleys and canyons, large areas of artificial lakes on a relatively small terrain. RESULTS: Based on the obtained verification results, the results of the model vary during time of day, the season of the year, the altitude of the station for which the model results were verified, as well as the surrounding relief for them. The results show the best performance in the central region and show deviations for some metrological measures in some periods of the year. CONCLUSION: This study can give recommendations on how to adapt a numerical model to a real situation in order to produce better weather forecast for the public.																			0928-7329	1878-7401					2023	31	4					1525	1539		10.3233/THC-229016	http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/THC-229016								36641700					WOS:001029075200033

Mass balance of two perennial snowfields: Niwot Ridge, Colorado, and the Ulaan Taiga, Mongolia	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Perennial snowfields are generally receding worldwide, though the precise mechanisms causing recessions are not always well understood. Here we apply a numerical snowpack model to identify the leading factors controlling the mass balance of two perennial snowfields that have significant human interest: Arapaho Glacier, located at Niwot Ridge in the Colorado Rocky Mountains (United States), and a snowfield located in the Ulaan Taiga (Mongolia). The two locations were chosen because they differ in elevation, slope, and aspect. However, both have subarctic climates and are located within semi-arid regions. We show that for these two locations the snowfield mass balance is primarily sensitive to air temperature and wind speed, followed by precipitation and dust deposition amounts. The lack of sensitivity to dust deposition was most likely due to timing of deposition and the overall small dust amounts. We find that the sensitivities are similar for the center of the snowfield as well as the margins.

J	Pfau, W				Pfau, W			DNA adducts in marine and freshwater fish as biomarkers of environmental contamination	BIOMARKERS												The analysis of DNA modifications in aquatic animals may serve as a sensitive marker of exposure to genotoxic contaminants. This is of importance in assessing water quality regarding pollution with genotoxic compounds, food safety analysing edible aquatic animals and in terms of ecotoxicology. Covalent modification of DNA is considered a crucial event in chemical carcinogenesis and thus may be considered a biomarker of an early genotoxic effect. Measuring DNA adducts is unique in that these lesions may be considered a biomarker of both exposure and effect. A number of studies have described the analysis of the DNA isolated from the liver of both freshwater and marine fish. Considerable levels of DNA adducts have been observed in some animals from contaminated lakes or rivers. Low levels were observed in DNA from the liver of marine fish. The background levels of DNA adducts have to be determined in animals from appropriate uncontaminated control sites that are matched for species, gender, age and season of the year. It is of crucial importance to consider the species analysed since there have been reports of the non-responsiveness of some species.																			1354-750X					MAY-JUN	1997	2	3					145	151		10.1080/135475097231670	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/135475097231670								23899174					WOS:A1997XD37800001

Malaria infection in pregnancy can have severe consequences for the fetus and the mother. To fight against malaria infection in pregnancy, Kenya integrated the issuance of an insecticide-treated net (ITN) and intermittent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTpSP) with antenatal care (ANC) for pregnant women. However, the uptake of the ITN and IPTpSP is still low. Individual, social, or structural factors may influence the low uptake. It is, therefore, important to identify the determinants associated with the uptake of ITN and IPTpSP during pregnancy in Kenya. Methods: Data were from the 2020 Kenya Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS). A total of 1779 women between the ages of 15 to 49 years who had a history of either being pregnant or having given birth within 5 years before the MIS survey were included. Survey-adjusted multinomial logistic regression was used in the analysis. Results: During pregnancy, ITN use was more than half (54.9%). The use of at least one dose of IPTpSP was 43.5%, three or more doses of IPTpSP was 27.2%, and only 28.2% of the participants used both ITN and IPTpSP during pregnancy. The significant determinants of combined use of ITN and IPTpSP during pregnancy were maternal age (RR 3.57, CI 1.80-7.08; p=< 0.001), maternal education (RRR 2.84, CI 1.33-6.06; p=0.007), wealth index (RR 2.14, CI 1.19-3.84; p=0.011) and living in the different malaria epidemiological zones: lake endemic (RRR 10.57 CI 5.65-19.76; p=< 0.001), coastal endemic area (RRR 4.86 CI 1.86-12.67; p=0.001), seasonal (RRR 0.21 CI 0.10-0.39; p=< 0.001) and low risk (RRR 0.07, CI 0.03-0.17; p=< 0.001). Conclusion: The uptake of malaria preventive measures is still below 80% for both ITN and IPTpSP during pregnancy in Kenya. The significant results on determinants of the use of ITN and IPTpSP could be considered in implementing malaria prevention programmes during pregnancy. For example, sensitizing the community on the importance of antenatal care visits will provide a platform to teach the importance of malaria prevention in pregnancy. Moreover, the pregnant mothers receive an ITN and IPTpSP during the ANC visit.					; Chirwa, Tobias/AAI-9087-2021; Ibisomi, Latifat/HPG-8847-2023	Ibisomi, Latifat/0000-0002-1607-1685; Kinyanjui, Samson/0000-0002-3910-0450; Kagura, Juliana/0000-0002-6608-6930; Mkubwa, Beatrice/0000-0002-2058-3325; 														1475-2875				DEC 29	2022	21	1							398	10.1186/s12936-022-04425-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12936-022-04425-x								36581863					WOS:000905915900001
J	Cleven, EJ; Königs, S				Cleven, Ernst-Josef; Koenigs, Sascha			Growth of interstitial ciliates in association with ciliate bacterivory in a sandy hyporheic zone	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												In situ growth rates of interstitial ciliates of a sandy hyporheic zone were determined by a modification of the dilution technique. Preconditioned sediment was used as a dilution substrate. Field incubation was conducted in the upper 3 cm sediment layer; samples were taken on 3 days (Days 0, 21 and 35) in October to November 2002. Mean growth rates varied between 0.070 d(-1) (Pleuronema spp.) and 0.089 d(-1) (other small scuticociliates) for the 21 d incubation period and between 0,093 d(-1) (Hymenostomatia) and 0.145 d(-1) (Placus spp.) for the 35 d incubation period. Mean generation times ranged between 4.8 and 9.9 d. Ciliate carbon production, determined on the basis of significant growth and mortality rates and summed up for the respective incubation period, ranged between 7 ng C g(-1) sediment dry weight (DW) (Cinetochilum margaritaceum) and 226 ng C g(-1) sediment DW (Hymenostomatia) for the 21 d incubation period, and was 6 ng C g(-1) sediment DW for the 35 d incubation period (Placus spp.). Losses due to predation ranged from 13.3 to 17.9 % d(-1) for ciliate carbon biomass and from 114.9 to 250.1 % d-1 for ciliate carbon production. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) was used to determine taxon-specific bacteria ingestion. Ingestion rates for C. margaritaceum, other small scuticociliates and Pleuronema spp. were 26, 50 and 86 bacteria ind.(-1) h(-1), respectively. Based on the estimated gross growth rates and on ciliate biomass and bacteria ingestion, we calculated the carbon requirement and the bacteria carbon ingestion required to enable this growth. The mean contribution of bacterivory to the carbon requirement for C. margaritaceum, other small scuticociliates and Pleuronema spp. amounted to only 7.0, 11.8 and 2.2 %, respectively.																			0948-3055					MAY 16	2007	47	2					177	189		10.3354/ame047177	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame047177													WOS:000247077800006

The population density of rotifers was maximal during the rainy season, mostly concentrated at the top of the water column. Rotifer communities in the riverine source station were different from the open lake communities and rotifer population density was poorest in the riverine section. Significant correlations were found between rotifers and several physico-chemical parameters of which oxygen was the most pronounced. Considerable affinity and close associations were also found to exist between rotifer species.																			0141-6707	1365-2028				DEC	1996	34	4					351	363		10.1111/j.1365-2028.1996.tb00631.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2028.1996.tb00631.x													WOS:A1996WD00400003

The compartments of internal soluble phosphorus were significantly correlated with the percentage cover of Porphyra on the sampling area. APA was inversely correlated with total internal phosphorus and particulate phosphorus. A dynamic model (resembling the cell quota model of Droop) was proposed to relate the enzymatic activity to the internal phosphorus content. According to this model, a maximum APA of 98.5 mu mol p-nitrophenol (pNP) released g.dry wt(-1).h(-1) and a minimum APA of 12.05 mu mol pNP g.dry wt(-1).h(-1) during the gametophytic cycle were estimated. Similarly, a maximum total phosphorus content of 4.2 mg P g.dry wt(-1) and a theoretical minimum total phosphorus content of 0.51 mg P g.dry wt(-1) throughout the gametophytic phase were estimated. The latter value might be close to the subsistence quota for phosphorus; the minimum quota for life.

J	Jasinski, JR; Haley, J				Jasinski, James R.; Haley, Jean			An Integrated Pest Management Adoption Survey of Sweet Corn Growers in the Great Lakes Region	JOURNAL OF INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT												Sweet corn is one of the most common fresh market vegetable crops grown throughout the north central and north east regions of the United States. In 2008, the Great Lakes Vegetable Working Group measured integrated pest management (IPM) practice adoption by growers of this crop using online and hardcopy surveys over a 10-mo period. The survey asked growers from nine states and Ontario, Canada, which pest management practices they used on their farm operation in the following sections: education, preplant, at-plant, in-season, postharvest, scouting, and demographics. Each individual survey question was ranked by a panel of university specialists and designated as a low, moderate, or high IPM valued activity, with points assigned accordingly. On survey completion, the total points accumulated by the grower would place them into one of three categories; low, moderate, or high IPM adopter. Of the 407 respondents, 130 were placed in the low IPM adoption category, 251 were deemed moderate IPM adopters, and 26 were placed in the high IPM category. Some key general attributes of a high IPM adopter include someone who has grown vegetables for at least 10 yr and has a farm > 51 acres (67%) and raises between 21-50 acres of sweet corn (44%). Some key general attributes of a low IPM adopter include less experience on smaller acreage, with 56% having grown vegetables for fewer than 10 yr with 57% on farms smaller than five acres.																				2155-7470				JUN 1	2014	5	2								10.1603/IPM13002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1603/IPM13002													WOS:000415078500001

Two typical habitats were selected: a river branch and a lake where this cyprinid is abundant. With the aims to understand the relationship between tench food and the macroinvertebrate community and to detect the possible feeding differences between the two populations studied throughout the year, samplings were carried out seasonally and the physico-chemical characteristics of the water and the abundance and biomass of the macroinvertebrates were analyzed. Tench were caught by electro-fishing in order to examine gut contents. Chironomid larvae are the preferential prey in both habitats. Also preferential are the gastropods in the river branch and small crustaceans in the lake. The results obtained suggest that tench is a rather unselective, generalist predator on the invertebrate community.					; Cayon Peña, Juan/ABE-2587-2021	Maze Gonzalez, Raquel Ana/0000-0002-8567-7883; 													0399-0974						2000	24	2					123	138																WOS:000088263400002

The model simulates the growth pattern of a well-established, monospecific stand of P. australis in die absence of genetic diversity and environmental stresses of mainly nutrient and water deficiency. The model formulated using first order differential equations was combined with plant phenology and comprises five subroutines in which photosynthetically active radiation, shoot, root, rhizome and new rhizome biomass are calculated. Using the model, experimental results were reproduced within reasonable limits having concordance correlation coefficients of more than 0.75 for 70% of the output parameters, which was the main objective of the study. The modelled efficiencies of PAR were 7.15% and 3.09%, as opposed to 7.7% and 2.53% in experimental estimations, for Loch of Forfar and Loch of Balgavies, respectively. Production and seasonal fluxes of dry matter of P. australis in Scottish lochs were estimated using the modelled quantities for the 1975 growing season in g m(-2). They showed that 31% and 37% of total net photosynthate translocated to rhizomes before shoot senescence began in Loch of Forfar and Loch of Balgavies, respectively. Also in both lochs approximately 45% of total downward translocation came from accumulated shoot dry matter during senescence, while the rest came from photosynthesis before the shoots started to senesce.					; Karunaratne, Shiromi/ABB-1511-2021; Asaeda, Takashi/C-5278-2008	Karunaratne, Shiromi/0000-0001-5815-4772; 													0015-5551						2000	35	4					419	432		10.1007/BF02803553	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02803553													WOS:000166975000007
J	Maxson, SJ; Haws, KV				Maxson, SJ; Haws, KV			Population studies of Piping Plovers at Lake of the Woods, Minnesota: 19 year history of a declining population	WATERBIRDS												We determined population status and reproductive success of Piping Plovers ( Charadrius melodus) at Lake of the Woods, Minnesota during 1988-2000. This is the only remaining breeding population of Piping Plovers in the state and is the last geographic link between the Great Lakes and Northern Great Plains populations. Previous studies, beginning in 1982, recorded populations of up to 50 birds at this location in 1984. Since then, despite intensive management attempts to improve reproductive success, numbers have gradually declined to a lo rv of six birds in 1997. Of 88 nests monitored over 13 years, 54.6% hatched, 18.2% were depredated, 13.6% were destroyed by storm waves and 13.6% were abandoned. The number of chicks fledged per breeding pair ranged from 0.0-2.7 ((x) over bar = 1.1) among years. Varying water levels either exposed broad sandy beaches or led to inundation of Piping Plover nests and substantial erosion of breeding habitat. Management activities included seasonal posting of sanctuaries, trapping of mammalian predators, destruction of Ring-billed Gull (Larus delawarensis) nests, use of elevated string gull deterrents, use of predator exclosures around nests, destruction of American Crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos) nests, and removal of trees and shrubs. Despite these efforts, during most years, fledging rates have been below those believed necessary for population stability.																			0738-6028						2000	23	3					475	481		10.2307/1522185	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1522185													WOS:000166519000014
J	CHEN, ZY; STANLEY, DJ				CHEN, ZY; STANLEY, DJ			ALLUVIAL STIFF MUDS (LATE PLEISTOCENE) UNDERLYING THE LOWER NILE DELTA PLAIN, EGYPT - PETROLOGY, STRATIGRAPHY AND ORIGIN	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Stiff muds of late Pleistocene age, interbedded with alluvial sands, are buried beneath Holocene deposits of the Nile delta in Egypt. The origin of the muds are interpreted on the basis of the petrology, stratigraphy and distribution of radiocarbon-dated sections recovered in cores across the northern delta. Four distinct stiff mud sequences, or subfacies, are defined on the basis of lithology, sand-sized composition and clay mineralogy. These sequences include (I) calcareous nodule-, (II) gypsum nodule-, (III) shell- and (IV) plant debris-bearing stiff muds. They accumulated: I, in seasonally flooded inland sebkhas proximal to Nile channels, which were then covered with wind-blow sand; II, in somewhat more central sectors of such playas, more distal to flood channels; III, in mom permanent salt lakes; and IV, in freshwater to low salinity marshes adjoining seasonally flooded playas. Sequence I, the dominant lithofacies, is concentrated in 14 geographically distinct lithosomes. Sequence II occurs at or near the center of these lithosomes, while III and IV are more localized. Spatial and temporal distribution of muds suggest a predominance of incised channels in the north-central Nile alluvial plain, and more laterally migrating channels to the northeast and northwest. Most stiff mud layers, deposited earlier than 34,000 and at approximately 28,000-22,000 and approximately 16,000- > 10,000 years BP, are correlated with several late Pleistocene aggradational phases of the Nile in upper Egypt. The more time-restricted gypsum nodule-bearing sequence II accumulated primarily during a period of increased aridity. Lower alluvial plain muds are also correlated with deposits of equivalent age offshore, on the Nile Cone. Paleogeographic reconstructions indicate that River Nile sediments bypassed the northwestern delta plain and were deposited on the Cone. Nile stiff mud facies, primarily sequences I and III, are compared with those of equivalent age in Yangtze and Mississippi delta cores. Gypsum-rich subfacies (sequence II) are regionally more restricted to warm, arid regions such as the Nile. We postulate that stiff muds underlie Holocene sections in all major delta plains, having accumulated at times of eustatic lowstands. Their petrology and distribution patterns are best explained in terms of depositional setting, fluvial sediment load and flood patterns, and especially, climate. The native and configuration of stiff muds has practical applications for civil engineering and construction purposes in deltaic settings, and also for hydrocarbon exploration.																			0749-0208					SPR	1993	9	2					539	576																WOS:A1993KW24300017

In this study, a novel adaptive Erlangization is introduced as a flexible intervention scheme, in which the sum of the intervention and observation costs is constrained in the sense of an expectation. The Hamilton- Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation is formulated by utilizing the method of Lagrangian multipliers as an optimality equation that is subject to the constrained expectation. We demonstrate that the HJB equation has a closed-form solution for a specific sand replenishment problem. This solution is used as a benchmark to verify a numerical algorithm for computing the HJB equation. Computational examples that focus on a sand replenishment problem in a river reach of a dam and a management problem of aquatic vegetation in a shallow lake are presented. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

J	Guo, YL; Sun, JS; Xu, GR; Zhou, ZM; Wang, JZ				Guo, Yinglian; Sun, Jisong; Xu, Guirong; Zhou, Zhiming; Wang, Jizhu			Influence of Underlying Surface on Distribution of Hourly Heavy Rainfall over the Middle Yangtze River Valley	ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY												The variation of boundary layer circulation caused by the influence of complex underlying surface is one of the reasons why it is difficult to forecast hourly heavy rainfall (HHR) in the middle Yangtze River Valley (YRV). Based on the statistics of high-resolution observation data, it is found that the low resolution data underestimate the frequency of HHR in the mountain that are between the twain-lake basins in the middle YRV (TLB-YRV). The HHR frequency of mountainous area in the TLB-YRV is much higher than that of Dongting Lake on its left and is equivalent to the HHR frequency of Poyang Lake on its right. The hourly reanalysis data of ERA5 were used to study the variation of boundary layer circulation when HHR occurred. It can be found that the boundary layer circulation corresponding to different underlying surfaces changed under the influence of the weather system. Firstly, the strengthening of the weather system in the early morning resulted in the strengthening of the southwest low-level air flow, which intensified the uplift of the windward slope air flow on the west and south slopes of the mountainous areas in the TLB-YRV. As a result, the sunrise HHR gradually increases from the foot of the mountain. The high-frequency HHR period of sunrise occurs when the supergeostrophic effect is weakened, the low-level vorticity and frontal forcing are strengthened, and the water vapor flux convergence begins to weaken. Secondly, the high-frequency HHR period of the sunset is caused by stronger local uplift and more unstable atmospheric stratification, but the enhanced local uplift is caused by the coupling of the terrain forcing of the underlying surface and the enhanced northern subgeostrophic flow, which causes the HHR to start closer to the mountain top at sunset than at sunrise.

Analyses were performed by regression analysis of 27 sets (3 scales .times. 3 depths .times. 3 dates) of replicate (n = 4) samples of the natural zooplankton (cladocerans, copepods, rotifers) community of Lake Cromwell, Quebec, Canada. Spatial heterogeneity was measured as the variance among the four randomly arranged replicate samples of taxa taken at each scale-depth-date combination. The spatial distribution of populations of zooplankton in this community was found to be typical of the spatial heterogeneity encountered in other freshwater and marine ecosystems. The effect of population density on spatial heterogeneity was comparable to that found for other flora and fauna. Small animals were more heterogeneous than large ones, and populations sampled on large spatial scales or at greater depths showed greatest spatial variability. These effects were stable over the season. Few taxa or life stages divereged significantly from these trends.					; Pinel-Alloul, Bernadette/U-9107-2019	Downing, John/0000-0001-8547-0789; Pinel-Alloul, Bernadette/0000-0002-1070-2968													0012-9658	1939-9170				OCT	1988	69	5					1393	1400		10.2307/1941636	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1941636													WOS:A1988Q291900009
J	BAKER, DB				BAKER, DB			THE LAKE ERIE AGROECOSYSTEM PROGRAM - WATER-QUALITY ASSESSMENTS	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT					INTERNATIONAL CONF ON AGRICULTURE AND THE ENVIRONMENT	NOV 11-14, 1991	COLUMBUS, OH					In contrast with the watersheds draining into Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron, and Ontario, where forestry is the dominant land use, the dominant land use in Lake Erie's watershed is row crop agriculture. Consequently, the tributaries draining into Lake Erie carry, on average, much larger loads of sediments, nutrients, and pesticides than do the tributaries entering the other Great Lakes. To support the development, operation, and assessment of agricultural non-point pollution control programs in the Lake Erie Basin, the major tributary watersheds are analyzed as large-scale agroecosystems, using mass balance approaches. Material export from the watersheds is based on detailed tributary loading studies which were initiated in the mid-1970s. The monitoring programs have now been in operation for up to 18 years, producing data that serve: (1) to assess the effectiveness of non-point pollution control efforts, (2) to guide future non-point pollution control programs, and (3) to illustrate many of the regional water quality impacts of agricultural land use. The water quality data illustrate the large day-to-day, season-to-season, and year-to-year variability in both pollutant concentrations and loads, which is characteristic of non-point pollution. The data also illustrate systematic shifts in pollutant concentration and loading patterns that occur in relation to watershed size. Although gross erosion rates in northwestern Ohio tributaries are relatively low, the phosphorus and nitrate export rates are high in comparison with other US streams and rivers. Analysis of the water quality data reveal significant downward trends in time for total and soluble phosphorus and significant upward trends in nitrate. The reductions in phosphorus export apparently reflect the effectiveness of agricultural pollution abatement programs that combine more careful fertilizer management with increasing use of conservation tillage. The increasing nitrate concentrations may reflect a trade-off associated with the adoption of conservation tillage.																			0167-8809					SEP	1993	46	1-4					197	215		10.1016/0167-8809(93)90024-J	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0167-8809(93)90024-J													WOS:A1993LZ67900016

Ten male Common Tems (Sterna hirundo) in 1990 and 12 in 1991 were radio-tracked by boat or car during the chick-rearing stage. Concurrent behavioural observations of the radio-tagged birds and 23 additional control birds documented the time each sex spent away from or at the nest. The frequency and prey species/size composition of feeds to chicks were recorded. Individuals that carried transmitters had predictable foraging patterns. In peak- (clutch initiation in early May) and late-nesting males (clutch initiation in late June) intra-individual variability was low. Late-nesting males exhibited greater interindividual variability than peak-nesting males. Adults recaptured in 1991 exhibited similar foraging patterns to those they expressed in 1990. There were diurnal, seasonal, and interannual variations in prey delivered to chicks. We suggest that these were due to the temperature tolerances of the prey, rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) and emerald shiner (Notropis atherinoides), that controlled their vertical distribution in the water column, and to the presence of large schools of larval fish during the late nesting season.

Highly productive fishing in Lake Onega? New data on the subsistence basis of the Late Stone age populations in Russian Karelia	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE-REPORTS												Recent excavations of the site of Fofanovo XIII (ca. 3500 to 3000 cal BC) on the western shore of Lake Onega, Russian Karelian, yielded evidence of production of Russian Karelian axes and adzes, as well as a rich faunal assemblage. Consisting mainly of unburnt bones, this assemblage represents a rare occurrence in Karelia and the neighboring regions of Russia and Finland, and sheds light on the subsistence of the Late Neolithic / Eneolithic populations of the Lake Onega. Fish bones overwhelmingly dominate, indicating a primary reliance on aquatic food resources, with the most common species being zander (over 80 %) and pike (ca. 9 %). In the specific natural conditions of the Early Subboreal in Lake Onega, zander was the species that could yield the maximal return of the invested effort, and this caused a very narrow specialization of fishing activities. The stable food supply provided by fishing favored tendencies towards complexity, which are evident through studies of the Russian Karelian industry. The analysis of the annual rings of zander vertebrae indicates that the site was in use during the snowless season. The identification of ringed seal, Atlantic sturgeon, and Wels catfish, which are not present in the lake nowadays, are also important results of the analysis.					; Askeyev, Arthur/ABC-3488-2020; Shyamuratova, Dilyara/MBH-0714-2025; Askeyev, Igor/MZR-9590-2025; Askeyev, Oleg/N-8628-2014; Tarasov, Alexey/D-8045-2019; Askeyev, Igor/P-5595-2018	Shyamuratova, Dilyara/0000-0002-7898-1350; Askeyev, Arthur/0000-0002-1214-7355; Askeyev, Oleg/0000-0001-6589-0479; Tarasov, Alexey/0000-0002-5737-5247; Askeyev, Igor/0000-0002-5304-4985													2352-409X					FEB	2023	47								103771	10.1016/j.jasrep.2022.103771	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jasrep.2022.103771		DEC 2022											WOS:000898789000002
J	Bunn, DC; Miller, N				Bunn, Dakota C.; Miller, Nicholas			Natural Occurrence and Analysis of Nosema sp. Infection in the Adult Population of Western Bean Cutworm in Michigan	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												An understanding of population dynamics and insect biology is important for effective crop management strategies. Biotic factors such as pathogens play a large role on the fitness and dynamics of insect populations. Microsporidia are obligate intracellular parasites that infect more than 150 insect species and range from sublethal and chronic to fast acting and deadly. The western bean cutworm, Striacosta albicosta (Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), is a pest of both corn (Zea maize L. [Poales: Poaceae]) and dry beans (Phaseolus sp L. [Fabales: Fabaceae]) that is infected by a microsporidian parasite from the genus Nosema (Microsporidia: Nosematidae). Unfortunately, little is known about the interactions between the Nosema sp. (Microsporidia: Nosematidae) infecting the western bean cutworm and its prevalence and effects on the host population. This is especially true for the western bean cutworm population that has settled in the Great Lakes region over the last two decades. Using field caught samples and phase contrast microscopy, no consistent trends in pathogen load were observed over the course of the western bean cutworm flight season. A weak, but statistically significant relationship was observed between male body weight and pathogen load. Overall, we found a 100% prevalence of infection in the adult western bean cutworm population in Michigan.

Due to the above advantages, chamber measurements play an important role while establishing long-term observations in the framework of such research infrastructures as Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS). CO2 and CH4 fluxes from Bakchar bog nearby Plotnikovo, West Siberia, were measured by means of a solar powered automated system (Flux-NIES) consisted of six static chambers installed along the transect and connected to the LI-820 NDIR analyzer and modified commercial methane sensor TGS-842, respectively. The water vapor can significantly affect the measurement accuracy of most gas-analyzers. It is recommended the ambient air to be completely or moderately dehumidified before supplying it to a measurement cell. We used a three-stage drying unit before supplying the air sample to the analyzers: an auto drain water trap, the Nafion dryer, and the chemical desiccants. The least square adjustment method with determining the linearity of the process by the pair correlation coefficient R was applied with the purpose of the most accurate determination of the gases fluxes value when processing changes in the output signals of the gas-analyzers in the closed chamber mode. The width of the data filtering window was determined by the maximum value of R-2 which corresponded to the highest values of the detected emission / uptake of the studied GHG at the soil - atmosphere boundary. Observations were carried out during the growing season (from May to October) in 2016-2020 at the hollow-ridge complex (O-site) oligotrophic bog. Correlation analysis made it possible to derive the dependences of CO2 (a)nd CH4 fluxes on the local hydrometeorological conditions of the surface. The seasonally integrated net CO2 uptake shows that Siberian wetland ecosystems are a strong sink of atmospheric carbon. Gases fluxes were correlated spatially: higher net uptake CO2 and lower CH4 emissions are observed at forested ridge with higher photosynthesis and respiration rates and drier surface conditions; lower net uptake CO2 and higher CH4 emissions were observed into wet hollow landscape. Constant high emission for CO2 and CH4 were observed on the surface tiny bog lake.

Information about the length-weight relationship (LWR) and condition factor (K) of this species, which is important for assessing and managing fish resources, is still limited. This study aimed to examine the variation of the LWR and K among seasons, localities and habitats of this species based on 2508 specimens collected in 2020-2021 from the Red River system in the north and a lake in the central highland of Vietnam. The standard length of the collected fish ranged 2.30-8.27 cm (4.65 +/- 0.84 cm) and the weight ranged 0.1-5.8 g (1.03 +/- 0.61 g). Fish weights could be predicted based on fish length with high accuracy, as the r(2) value of LWR was high (r(2) > 0.83). The b values ranged 2.804-3.462, being higher than those in temperate and subtropical populations in China. This species generally showed positive allometric growth with a b value generally larger than 3, meaning smaller individuals having more elongated body shape than older individuals. The estimated K value for all individuals was lower than the nutritional threshold of 1, thus suggesting that R. similis lived in unfavourable environmental conditions at the time of sampling. The growth pattern and K varied with season, locality and habitat. In the riverine habitat of the Red River, this species expressed a positive allometric growth during the rainy season but isometric during the dry season. The K values were higher than 1 in some cases and were higher during the rainy season as compared to the dry season, higher in the riverine habitat of the Red River and in the lacustrine habitat of the south than in other habitats. These latitudinal variances in the growth pattern and K across various regions affirm the adaptive ability of this species in various habitats. The obtained data will be useful for controlling this fish while managing ecosystems since it is abundant in tropical regions and has potential ecological impacts on native species.

As a large tidal wetland dominated by reeds in Liaoning province, China, the Shuangtai estuary wetland is a unique ecosystem class. To better understand the spatial and temporal distributions of total phosphorus (TP) in the sediments of the Shuangtai estuary wetland during the period of reed growth, eight sampling sites were established within the wetland, approximately 11 to 24 km from Liaohe River. These sites were sampled once a month at multiple sediment depth intervals between April and October in 2018 and 2019, periods of time that corresponded with the reed growth period. An alkali fusion method was used to determine TP in the sediment samples. The results show that sediment TP content of wetland sediments ranged from 0.001 to 0.781 mg/kg, and decreases from southwest to northeast with the increase in sediment depth. The TP content reaches the maximum corresponding to the fastest growth stage of the reeds (June and July), while the minimum occurs in October (i.e., the maturity stage of reeds). The variation law of TP in cross-sectional sediment in the wetland is that the deeper the sediments are, the lower the content; its maximum content occurs in surface soil. The TP content of each site tends to be stable with increasing depth and has a regularly dynamic seasonal variation with the growth of reeds.

Long term temperature and rainfall trends at various stations as well as hydrologic parameters in multipurpose dams in the Philippines were examined. Results indicated generally increasing trends of yearly temperature at representative stations. However, the inter-annual variations of yearly and seasonal rainfall indicated geographical patterns among trends. Rainfall trends in western Luzon are mainly increasing while decreasing trends are indicated in eastern section of Luzon, most parts of Visayas and the whole of Mindanao. Water inflows in the major multipurpose dams in Luzon and at Lake Lanao in Mindanao indicated decreasing trends. Decrease of water inflow is found to be prominent during ENSO events. Most drought occurrences based on climatological studies in the Philippines are found to be ENSO-related. At this stage of the investigation, there is a tendency to believe that the trends exhibited by the above-mentioned parameters are associated with some shifting in the global circulation patterns. Effects of other factors such as land use change, increase of population and other non-climatic factors on such trends can not however be discounted.

We tested this expectation with a dynamic simulation model that was calibrated to three lakes undergoing whole-lake nutrient and food web manipulations. Total areal chlorophyll increased due to nutrient enrichment in each lake, but the magnitude of the response varied between lakes. Modeling experiments, which allowed analysis of separate components of each lake's response to nutrient enrichment, indicated that the response to enrichment depended on lake water color and food web structure. In weakly stained lakes (similar to 10 mg Pt I-1, k(d) = 0.4 m (-1)), metalimnetic chlorophyll was stimulated by nutrient enrichment up to moderate levels (1 mu g P I-1 day(-1)). In more strongly colored lakes (25 mg Pt 1(-1), k(d) 1.0), metalimnetic chlorophyll responded negatively to nutrient enrichment at all P loading rates. Food web structure, as expressed by rates of zooplanktivory, interacted with water color in two ways. One impact was through direct grazing losses on metalimnetic chlorophyll. The other process involved was indirect impact from grazing on epilimnetic phytoplankton, which reduced shading on metalimnetic chlorophyll. Vertical redistribution of chlorophyll between the epilimnion and the metalimnion led to little accumulation of areal chlorophyll with increased P loading over limited ranges of water color and nutrient input rates. Model predictions may be most effectively tested with whole-lake experiments contrasting food web structure, water color and nutrient loading.

However, zooplankton ecology has been studied mainly from the water bodies of Central (Trans Mexican Volcanic Belt), eastern (the Yucat??an Peninsula), and southern Mexico. In contrast, the zooplankton from the Mesa Central water bodies has been insufficiently investigated. After a long history of zooplankton taxonomic studies, the first contributions to the zooplankton ecology dated to the 1990 s, rapidly increasing afterward. Most ecological information arises from field investigations and experiments under laboratory conditions, lacking mesocosms and whole-lake experiments. In the same way, the studies have been carried out in lentic, natural, and artificial water bodies, primarily eutrophic. Differently, the zooplankton ecology of lotic ecosystems is largely unknown. Here we summarized the progress made in the study of the zooplankton ecology of Mexican inland waters, revealing the most important research topics developed so far.

K.; Schramm, Karl-Werner			The impact of agronomic inputs on selected physicochemical features and their relationships with heavy metals levels in surface sediment and water in sugarcane farms in Nzoia, Kenya	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Sugarcane farming is the most important cash crop cultivation activity in the Lake Victoria basin of Kenya practised in an area covering approximately 114,000 Ha in total. For better yields, various agronomic inputs including fertilizers and herbicides have been used intensively in the farms, causing serious concerns about their potential impacts on the aquatic ecosystems within the lake basin. In this study, the physicochemical features of surface sediment and water including pH, total organic carbon contents and heavy metal (Cd, Cu, Zn, Pb and Cr) loads in River Kuywa and in runoff canals in sugarcane farms in Nzoia nucleus estate within the lake basin were determined to assess the effects of agronomic activities including agronomic inputs in the form of nitrogenous fertilizers [urea and diammonium phosphate (DAP)], herbicides and sewage sludge used in farming on their levels. The results indicated significant differences (p a parts per thousand currency sign 0.05) in the heavy metal levels in sediment and water samples taken before and after the farms, respectively, indicating a positive impact on the concentration levels. The canal water and sediment samples' heavy metal levels were also significantly higher than those of the river samples showing that the influent sugarcane farm canal waters transfer these contaminants into River Kuywa. Although the levels of these parameters were significantly higher in the canals than in the controls obtained from outside the sugarcane farms, the heavy metal levels in soil samples from within the farms with similar agronomic activities did not differ significantly among the various plots. The turbidity, electrical conductivity, temperature, water and soil pH and total organic carbon values in samples obtained within the sugarcane farms showed significant seasonal variations and differed significantly from the values in the controls showing a significant negative impact of agronomic inputs on water quality.

The total alphaGlcA (0.7-5.0 nmol.l-1.h-1) correlated with chlorophyll-a, bacterial and cladoceran biomasses, and abundance of heterotrophic nanoflagellates. The total betaGlcA (2.0-7.9 nmol.l-1.h-1) showed a relationship to cladoceran biomass. The particle-bound betaGlcA correlated with bacterial and cladoceran biomasses and chlorophyll-a. The total betaGlcNAcA (1.3-7.4 nmol.l-1-h-1) correlated with copepod biomass. Ecological significance of betaGlcNAcA was supported by N-acetyl-C-14-glucosamine incorporation (V(max): 0.42-1.98 nmol.l-1.h-1), which indicates the ability of microorganisms to utilize the liberated N-acetylglucosamine. Relationships found for the above enzyme activities to zooplankton might be explained by subsequent bacterial hydrolysis of nondigested algal or chitinaceous remains egested by cladocerans and copepods.

J	BREWER, JS; GRACE, JB				BREWER, JS; GRACE, JB			PLANT COMMUNITY STRUCTURE IN AN OLIGOHALINE TIDAL MARSH	VEGETATIO												An oligohaline tidal marsh on the northern shore of Lake Pontchartrain, LA was characterized with respect to the distributions and abundances of plant species over spatial and temporal gradients using Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA). In addition, the species distributions were correlated to several physical environmental factors using Detrended Canonical Correspondence Analysis (DCCA). The distributions of species were best correlated with distance from Lake Pontchartrain, and to a lesser extent with elevation and substrate organic matter. They were least correlated with mean soil salinity (referred to here as background salinity). Of the three mid-seasonal dominant species, the perennial grass, Spartina patens, is the most salt tolerant and was found closest to the lake. Further inland the dominant perennial was Sagittaria lancifolia, which has a salt tolerance less than that of Spartina patens. The perennial sedge, Cladium jamaicense, which is the least salt tolerant of the three, was dominant furthest inland. Background salinity levels were generally low (< 5 ppt.) and did not explain species distributions. We hypothesize that the distribution of species is regulated by occasional storm-generated 'salt pulses' that generate strong, short-lived salinity gradients as a function of distance from the lake. Biotic interactions likely also play a role in structuring the plant community. The distributions of several annuals depended on the size and life history of the mid-seasonal dominant perennials. Most of the annuals frequently co-occurred with Sagittaria lancifolia, which was the shortest in stature and had the least persistent canopy of the three mid-seasonal dominant perennials.

J	Hornung, J; Hinderer, M; Brüsch, D; Petschick, R				Hornung, Jens; Hinderer, Matthias; Bruesch, Dennis; Petschick, Rainer			An exceptional sedimentary record of initial rifting on the East African Plateau in the Miocene: Lessons from depositional cyclicity and palaeoenvironmental proxies	DEPOSITIONAL RECORD												Knowledge about the initial tectonic and depositional dynamics, as well as the influence of early rifting on climate and environmental evolution remains speculative to a large extent, because sediments are usually deeply buried. Within the East African Rift System, inversion tectonics uplifted a few of these successions to the surface hence presenting rare windows into the pre-rift depositional history. One such example, an exceptional 700m long and up to 60m high fresh road cut provided the opportunity to study in detail initial rift successions of the southern Albertine Rift (Western Uganda). This focusses on the basal and poorly known Middle to Late Miocene in order to unravel the climatic, environmental, hydrological and tectonic evolution of the initial Albertine Rift. A large and robust multi-proxy dataset was gathered comprising 169 m of stratigraphic thickness, which spans from 14.5 to 4.9 Ma according to a revised lithostratigraphic model. Fieldwork comprised logging of the sedimentary record, spectral gamma ray, magnetic susceptibility and 2D wall mapping with photomosaics. Additionally, the sections were sampled for bulk mineral and clay mineral analysis. The succession exposes a suite of lithofacies and architectural elements detailing the evolution of a fluvio-lacustrine system. Five depositional environments were identified which show an overall back-stepping trend from an alluvial plain to a delta plain and finally palustrine/shallow lacustrine conditions. Mesoscale base-level cycles, preservation potential of architectural elements, and stacking pattern exhibit limited accommodation space. However, it increases over time. This overall trend indicates increasing tectonic subsidence, which can be explained by flexural downwarp within the pre-rift phase and in the upper part grading into fault-controlled crustal extension of the syn-rift phase, which more and more disrupted a large-scale river system. From the Middle Miocene up to the early Pliocene, this study revealed that palaeoclimate trends become marked by increasing and more fluctuating Th concentrations, loss of feldspar, intercalated lenses of hydroxosulphate minerals, and a shift from smectite-dominated to kaolinite-dominated clays. These signals are all interpreted as detrital except for the hydroxosulphates, and they mirror the increasing intensity of chemical weathering and stripping of soils in the catchment. A trend towards increasing humidity is supported by an increase in lacustrine sediment facies and a lake-level rise. Nevertheless, intercalation of hydroxosulphate, ferricretes and pedogenised horizons prove ongoing seasonality and dry intervals. Finally, based on a revised stratigraphic model a sequence stratigraphic correlation of the outcrop's depositional cycles with basinscale cycles is presented. According to these cycles, transition from the pre-rift to the syn-rift stage is marked by an unconformity and a tectonic pulse in the latest Miocene. However, the response of fluvial supply, the depositional system as well as climate conditions are less punctuated and characterised by gradual trends and temporal delays. The long pre-rift phase (Ca 10 Myr) and the gradual transition to the syn-rift phase is in accordance with the active rifting model, which is based on thermal thinning of the lithosphere by asthenospheric upwelling.

There is a growing number of microplastic studies in wetlands and floodplains such as the Pantanal. Microplastics in the Pantanal's water courses, lakes, and floodplains were sampled with a plankton net in 16 locations in the Pantanal lowlands at varying distances from their potential urban sources over 2 years. Microplastics from the water samples were separated from sediments and organic matter and examined under a stereomicroscope to be identified and counted. Visual determination was then confirmed by RAMAN spectrometry. We found 730 microplastics. The average +/- std microplastic concentration was 38 +/- 16 x/m(3), ranging between 10 and 100 x/m(3). Fibres, fragments, and films represented 68%, 28%, and 4%, respectively, of the total microplastics. Surprisingly, a synthetic blue fibre of non-identified composition accounted for 51.0% of the microplastics. Other identified polymers included PP (18.2%), PET (16.9%), PVC (5.1%), PVA (4.4%) and LDPE (4.4%). The blue fibres, PP, and PET were found at all sampling locations. Microplastic concentrations varied from 27 +/- 12 x/m(3) to 48 +/- 21 x/m(3) across the sampling sites. Microplastics' average size was 0.51 +/- 0.21 mm, ranging from 0.06 to 0.97 mm. In the study area, the average seasonal concentrations varied from 34 +/- 11 to 43 +/- 18 x/m(3) during the 2 years study period (2018-2019). In lentic environments, the median concentrations (30 x/m(3)) were significantly lower than in the lotic ones (40 x/m(3)). Urban human activities are a potential source of microplastics as the concentration of these increased significantly with the population of the nearest human agglomeration. These results indicate widespread contamination of the Pantanal waters by microplastics. Furthermore, a microsynthetic of indeterminate composition is found everywhere in the Pantanal, and more research is urgently needed to determine its composition and sources. The contamination by micropolymers and other microsynthetics will likely impact the Pantanal biota and, eventually, humans living in these floodplains.					; Sanz-Lazaro, Carlos/F-9353-2011; Girard, Pierre/D-6038-2013	Girard, Pierre/0000-0002-8411-0690; Sanz-Lazaro, Carlos/0000-0002-4431-1762; Wambier Christo, Susete/0000-0001-9191-4171; 														2296-665X				NOV 18	2022	10								878152	10.3389/fenvs.2022.878152	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2022.878152													WOS:000904846300001

In 1991 the population had declined further to about 60 individuals (mortality rate about 30% p.a.). In 1984 and 1991 road counts in the park were conducted. In 1984 a total distance of 2705 km was covered which yielded sightings of 777 elephant groups. In 1991 this distance was 5486 km and only 53 groups were observed. In both years an average elephant was seen in a group of seven individuals. Poaching pressure, apparently, had no effect on average group sizes. Group size changes with season, both in 1984 and 1991. The smallest groups were observed during the dry season when Acacia tortilis pods provided a defendable resource. In 1984, elephant occurred significantly more than expected in groups of five-nine individuals and less than expected in groups of one or two individuals or in groups larger than 16. This has been interpreted as a confirmation of the family structure of elephant as reported in other studies. In 1991, elephant group sizes were distributed according to a model of random association of individuals, indicative of destruction of the social framework by poaching.					van der Jeugd, Henk/S-3159-2019; van der Jeugd, Henk/F-4891-2010	van der Jeugd, Henk/0000-0002-5332-9526; Prins, Herbert/0000-0003-1131-5107													0141-6707					SEP	1994	32	3					185	191		10.1111/j.1365-2028.1994.tb00570.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2028.1994.tb00570.x													WOS:A1994PD29800002

Different sized adult bream (Abramis brama L.) and carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) were stocked at different densities. Benthivores were forced to feed on benthos by introduction of planktivorous perch (Perca fluviatilis L.) fry. Total dry biomass of benthic macroinvertebrates was not clearly reduced neither by large nor by small bream stockings. Carp significantly reduced the biomass of total benthos. Some members of the benthos might be influenced by fish only indirectly contributing to formation of new microhabitats preferred by these invertebrates.																			0003-9136					SEP	1994	131	3					309	320																WOS:A1994PP95700004

Trends in gonadosomatic indices and reproductive stages of development suggested that C. guntheri is a multiple (fractional) spawner and breeds all year round with little fluctuation in spawning intensity. However, spawning activities were more intensive in August and September. The estimated mean standard length at first maturity did not differ significantly between rivers. It was, in the overall population, 85.53 mm SL for males and 100.13 mm SL for females. In general, the sex ratio differed from 1:1 with the predominance of the males in rivers, standard length classes, seasons and the entire population. Absolute fecundity (F) varied from a minimum of 70 to a maximum of 470 eggs. The range of variation in the relative fecundity was from 3066 to 9135 eggs per kilogram of fish in the total population. Fecundity did not differ extensively between rivers. The absolute fecundity relations to fish standard length (SL) and eviscerated weight (We) were best described in the whole population by the following equations: F = 0.00069 x SL(2.72) and F = 2.54 x We(1.15), respectively. Moreover, there was no relationship between absolute fecundity and oocyte diameter.

J	de Vicente, I; Guerrero, F; Cruz-Pizarro, L				de Vicente, Inmaculada; Guerrero, Francisco; Cruz-Pizarro, Luis			Chemical composition of wetland sediments as an integrator of trophic state	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Because eutrophication constitutes a key problem in limnology, evaluation of trophic state is a preliminary and essential step for the conservation and management of aquatic ecosystems. Frequently, lake trophic state is expressed by using parameters measured in the water column such as water transparency, total phosphorus or chlorophyll-a concentrations. The application of these indices usually requires repeated seasonal monitoring of the system for obtaining the annual mean values. Considering that lake sediments reflect lake trophic state, in this work we show the relevance of using sediment composition (total N and organic matter content) for obtaining quantitative data related to lake trophic state (bio-production number, BPN). Our results show that the estimated values obtained with BPN (ranging from 5.23 to 6.33), in a lake with relatively low organic matter content, reflected the trophic state as estimated by traditional water-column methods. Furthermore, the reproducibility of the BPN method, which is reflected by the constant BPN values along time, means that only one sampling including the spatial heterogeneity of the surface sediment, can provide a reasonable composite measure of trophic condition in a wetland. Finally, and as it represents a less time-consuming index, we propose the BPN as an appropriate trophic state indicator for wetlands, shallow lakes, and aquatic systems showing large temporal variability.

Minor water bodies around southern Lake Victoria-a replica of lost biodiversity	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												The catchment and water chemistry of Lake Victoria are greatly influenced by the inflow of rivers and the alternation of the dry and wet seasons. The ecological integrity of the lake has been altered as a result of changes in its physical, chemical, and biological properties resulting from natural and anthropogenic forces. With human population growth, there has been an increase in the multiplicity of activities in the lake basin rendering the lake environmentally unstable. The diversity of the fauna, especially of fish and of the flora declined and the health of the ecosystem deteriorated due to excessive fishing pressure, predation, and competition among introduced species, wetland degradation, poor watershed management and pollution. The nutrient content in Lake Victoria has increased and the consequent eutrophication had a big impact on the biodiversity of the cichlids. Factors that had been affecting Lake Victoria had not impacted the small water bodies in the basin on the same scale. There are several pockets of rare and even extinct species in Lake Victoria that still survive in several ox-bow lakes associated with the extensive wetlands around Lake Victoria. The phytoplankton, zooplankton and fish communities known to be missing in the main lake continued to survive in these minor water bodies. Species still occurring in both habitats exhibit different levels of tolerance to exploitation levels. However, there is no clear policy to conserve the minor water habitats. The paper compares the common taxa in Lake Victoria and the satellite lakes identifying the rare ones in an attempt to mobilize forces to conserve them.					; Mrosso, Hillary/JAX-8503-2023	Mrosso, Hillary Deogratias John/0000-0003-1924-7268; 													1463-4988						2010	13	3					277	283		10.1080/14634988.2010.506850	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14634988.2010.506850													WOS:000281763400006

Spectral test was carried out on the soil with FieldSpec3 of ASD Company. Meanwhile, component testing was executed in the laboratory to analyze and study the soil reflection spectrum characteristics and the relationship between organic matters, iron and content of water soluble salt in the soil. It has been found that the content of organic matters does not influence the soil spectral characteristics but does influence the spectral reflectance, that when the iron is between 1960 and 2040nm and the correlation coefficient between the iron and the reflectance reciprocal reaches -0.9114 at most, significant correlation presents, and that the reflectance characteristics of the water soluble salt to the soil shows negative correlation as the wavelength increases, especially in wave bands of 1940-1980nm and 2390-2460nm, the significant correlation presenting. When the content of the water soluble salt reaches 50% and above, the reflection spectrum curve represents strong absorption from 1400nm; and before the later reflectance is obviously lower than 1400nm, the absorption valley caused by adsorbed water and hydroxyl in the soil becomes more obvious at 1400nm and 1950nm. In the soil, the influence of the iron and the water soluble salt on the reflection spectrum characteristics is very identical. Iron is a major element of the water soluble salt.																					978-1-4244-7302-1				2010																								WOS:000296522300007

Organic facies of Holocene carbonates in North Stromatolite Lake, Coorong region, South Australia	CADERNOS DO LABORATORIO XEOLOXICO DE LAXE, VOL 35	Cadernos do Laboratorio Xeoloxico de Laxe-Revista de Xeoloxia Galega e do Hercinico Peninsular											Numerous small, shallow, ephemeral lakes are scattered along the seaward margin of the extensive Pleistocene beach-dune ridge system that comprises the coastal plain of southeastern South Australia. Fed primarily by seasonal inflow of alkaline ground water, these lakes are sites of Holocene carbonate deposition. North Stromatolite Lake is part of a chain of such lakes located immediately south of Salt Creek, within the first interdunal corridor landward of the Coorong Lagoon. Here four different sedimentary fades (basal quartzose skeletal packstone; organic-rich mudstone with thin sapropel layers; laminated pelletal mudstone; and massive pelletal wackestone/mudstone) occur within a shoaling-upwards carbonate cycle (similar to 3 metres thick) and define the following vertical succession of environments: estuarine, density-stratified lacustrine, perennial lacustrine and, finally, ephemeral lacustrine. Acquisition of X-ray diffraction, total organic carbon (TOC), Rock-Eval pyrolysis, visual kerogen and biomarker hydrocarbon data on sediment samples (n = 35) from a single core taken near the centre of the lake has allowed the recognition of five discrete organic facies, each with a distinctive mineralogy. The organic-rich unit (6-12% TOC) may be subdivided into organic facies 1 (Type I/II kerogen) and 2 (Type II kerogen), whereas the organically leaner laminated and massive units are distinctly bimodal hosting both organic facies 3 (Type kerogen) and 4 (Type III kerogen). The latter two facies together define an inverse relationship between hydrogen index and TOC content, a geochemical signature that may be attributed to differences in the extent of pelletisation of carbonate muds by a diverse salt-tolerant fauna including brine shrimp, gastropods and ostracods during the shallowing perennial and ephemeral phases of the Lake's history. The basal unit hosts organic facies 5 (Type IV kerogen). The aliphatic hydrocarbon distributions of these lacustrine sediments are dominated by C-20 and C-25 highly branched isoprenoids; and C-12-C-33 n-alkanes displaying marked odd/even predominance above, and even/odd predominance below, C-20. This biomarker assemblage reflects the respective major contributions of bacillariophyceae (diatoms), chlorophyceae (green algae) and eubacteria (including cyanobacteria) to their preserved organic matter. Its passage through the guts of the aforementioned grazers and excretion as faecal pellets has dramatically enhanced the relative abundance of cholest-2-ene, thereby imparting to the pelletised upper sapropel, laminated and massive units a hitherto unrecognised molecular signature. This signature of ingestion may remain in such micritic limestones, even where their original pelleted texture has been obliterated by the physical compaction that accompanies early burial and diagenesis. Of wider significance is our finding that lacustrine sediments containing high levels of hydrogen-rich protokerogen may have accumulated beneath relatively shallow bottom waters (< 5 m deep) that were not perennially anoxic.

Some observations on the spawning season of Barbus amphigramma in Lake Naivasha, Kenya	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												The objective of the study was to investigate some aspects of the breeding patterns of the cyprinid Barbus amphigramma in Lake Naivasha. The study was carried out from February to October, 2003. Fishing was done with the use of gillnets of mesh size 0.5 inch to 3 inch and a beach seine of mesh size 1 inch. Six gonad maturity stages have been described visually, based on morphological features, and validated by histological features of the ovary, as well as examination of the oocyte diameter. Females dominate the population at all sizes classes. Barbus amphigramma spawns all year round, but with discernible peaks in March, July and October. The peaks in March and October correspond with the beginning of the long and short rains, respectively, in Kenya.																			1463-4988						2010	13	2					214	221		10.1080/14634988.2010.481240	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14634988.2010.481240													WOS:000278571700012

The lapillus was used to determine the age in days following previous studies. The hatching months of fish estimated on the basis of lapillus increment counts were from November to July (nine months of a year), demonstrating that this species had an extended spawning season. Based on the age analysis, the fish were separated into two hatching groups: fish that hatched in the rainy season and those that hatched in the dry season. The growth rate of the former (0.70 mm TL per day) was significantly higher than the latter (0.52 mm TL per day).

The rapidly shifting balance between naked flagellates and several digestion-resistant species is evident in both seasonal patterns and in enclosure experiments. The balance between flagellates and resistant species helps explain asymmetrical demographic responses of competing smaller bodies cladocerans to changes in Daphnia density. Shifts between refractory components and accessible, edible algae constitute a prime reason why general measures of phytoplankton (e.g., chlorophyll a, biomass, biovolume, primary productivity) may fail to reflect impacts of Daphnia fluctuations. Rapid changes in resource quality may also provide a simple explanation for why Daphnia''s tendency to show unstable oscillatory dynamics in the laboratory is dampened in natural populations.																			0012-9658	1939-9170				DEC	1988	69	6					1806	1825		10.2307/1941159	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1941159													WOS:A1988R017400020

A whole-lake alkalinity and ion budget for Lake 223 showed that 66-81% of the added sulfuric acid was neutralized by alkalinity production in the lake. Nearly 85% of in situ alkalinity production was accounted for by net loss of sulfate through bacterial sulfate reduction, coupled with iron reduction and iron sulfide formation, in littoral sediments (60%) and in the hypolimnion (25%). Exchange of hydrogen ion for calcium and manganese in the sediments accounted for 19% of the alkalinity generated, while other cations were net sinks for alkalinity. Alkalinity input from the watershed of Lake 223 was very small, averaging about 5% of that produced in the lake. The seasonal production of 1,000 .mu.eq liter-1 alkalinity in the anoxic hypolimnion of this softwater lake could be attributed to bacterial sulfate reduction coupled with iron sulfide formation, ammonium production, and iron (II) production. Only the alkalinity produced from bacterial sulfate reduction coupled with iron sulfide formation remained throughout the annual cycle.					; Schindler, David/A-3752-2014	Kelly, Carol/0000-0003-2473-7560; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	1986	31	1					134	148		10.4319/lo.1986.31.1.0134	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1986.31.1.0134													WOS:A1986A266300012

Additionally, this rapid expansion has significantly impacted the ecological environment, and human activities surround the lake. Thus, it is of great importance to reveal the expansion pattern of Seling Co Lake for a long time-series. Previous studies always contained errors when exploring this subject due to the limitations associated with the quality of remote sensing images. To overcome the existing deficiency, a method based on the SRTM1 DEM and a water frequency Landsat-series dataset is developed to reconstruct the complete inundation area of Seling Co Lake from 1987 to 2021 while taking full advantage of the relationship between the water frequency and terrain. The results show that the water frequency reconstruction model proposed in this study has a significant optimization effect on the restoration of the permanent and seasonal water areas of Seling Co Lake. In particular, the proposed method can effectively improve the underestimated water-frequency pixel values of the seasonal waters located on the southern and northern shores of Seling Co Lake. The water-inundation area of Seling Co Lake showed an overall increasing trend with a rate of 26.02 km(2)center dot year(-1) (p < 0.01), and this expansion trend was mainly concentrated in the southern and northern parts of the lake. This study cannot only provide an efficient and feasible remote sensing means of reconstructing the water-inundation area for lakes in complex terrain according to topographic conditions but also greatly refines our understanding of the annual variations in the water-inundation area of Lake Seling Co.

From wetlands to wetlandscapes: Remote sensing calibration of process-based hydrological models in heterogeneous landscapes	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Wetlands are vital components of landscapes that sustain a range of important ecosystem services. Understanding how wetland-rich landscapes-or wetlandscapes-will evolve under a changing climate and increasing anthropogenic encroachment is urgent. Wetlandscapes are highly heterogeneous, and scaling local modelling insights from individual instrumented wetlands to characterize landscape-scale dynamics has been a pervasive challenge. We investigate the potential to use water extent information from satellite imagery to calibrate landscape-scale process-based hydrological models. Applications to wetlandscapes in the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) in North Dakota and the Texas Playa Lakes (TPL) shed light on two important trade-offs. First, in-situ monitoring provides accurate water extent information on an arbitrary subset of wetlands, whereas satellite imagery captures landscape-scale hydrological dynamics but suffers persistent water-detection challenges. Satellite imagery is a superior source of data for model calibration in sparsely monitored and spatially heterogeneous landscapes like the PPR, where the sampling uncertainty of monitored wetlands exceeds the water detection uncertainty of remote sensing. The two data sources are equivalent for more homogeneous landscapes like the TPL. The second tradeoff concerns the spatial resolution and temporal coverage of satellite imagery. In that regard, the 20 years of bi-weekly images captured by Landsat 7 provides unprecedented insights into the dynamic nature of the ecohydrological characteristics of wetlandscapes, such as seasonal and inter-annual changes of their metapopulation capacity. In the PPR, the amplitude of these dynamics far exceeds the bias introduced by Landsat's inability to capture ecologically important connectivity details due to its coarse spatial resolution compared to more recent imagery.

Ranga; Ramanamurthy, M., V			Benthic quality assessment of a hypersaline lake along the southeast coast of India	REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE												The study describes macrobenthic community structure for assessing the benthic quality of a hyper-saline lake along the southeast coast of India. Sediment and water samples were collected during November 2018 (Northeast Monsoon & mdash; NEM), April (Pre-Monsoon & mdash; PRM), and July 2019 (Southwest Monsoon & mdash; SWM). Based on salinity distribution the lake can be characterized into four regions viz., Northern inlet, Middle inlet, Southern inlet, and Central region. Seasonal analysis showed that the middle inlet and the central region of the lake experience hypersaline conditions throughout the year. Macrobenthic abundance and diversity index were high during SWM compared to other seasons. Some macrobenthic species (Cirratulus filiformis, Pagurapseudopsis gymnophobia, Apseudes chilkensis, Tanais sp.) showed a high preference for non-hypersaline regions while their presence in hypersaline regions was comparatively low/sparse. The present study identified that polychaete species such as Dendonereis aestuarina, Sigambra parva, Capitella capitata, Heteromastus similis can survive in hypersaline (> 60) conditions.

There was no significant trend in the infection rate among the different sampling dates in May-July. In total, 24.6% of females and 15.4% of mates were infected. In most cases (>95%) there was only one plerocercoid per host. In females, there was no correlation between the size group of fish and the infection rate, but larger males had significantly higher infection rate than smaller ones. There was no significant correlation between the parasite-host index and length of females. Condition factor of infected females was significantly higher than that of uninfected females. In the uninfected females, average +/- SD diameter of oocytes was 1.19 +/- 0.10 mm and they were in the trophoplasmatic growth stage. In contrast, only small (<0.4 mm) oocytes in the protoplasmatic growth stage were found in the infected females, which indicates that they were not able to spawn in the study year. GSI of infected females (median GSI = 0.07) was significantly lower as compared with that of uninfected individuals (median GSI = 13.24).																			1239-6095	1797-2469				DEC 18	2009	14	6					932	936																WOS:000273108200002

Diurnal time-activity budgets of about 173 birds were compiled during two breeding seasons, from pre-breeding to postnuptial moult. Separate budgets were constructed for males and females White-headed Duck. During the breeding season, sleeping proved to be the main diurnal activity for males (40 %), reflecting the thermoregulatory advantage to resting during the day. Conversely, females feeding more (26 %) than males (19 %) during the pre-breeding period reflect their need to acquire nutrients and energy for egg production and incubation. Courtship and agonistic behaviour, more important during pre-breeding (i.e. laying and incubation periods), indicate that some males tried to engage in extra-pair copulation, and others tried to guard their females against this. Comfort increasing from June and July for both sexes reflect that moult takes place. Alert was more important during postnuptial period, males and females White-headed Duck allocated the same time to protect chicks and juveniles from different enemies. This study provides recent and original data on the behaviour of an endangered species, whose activities during the breeding season in the wild are little known, especially for each sex.

Relationship between bacterial and primary production in a newly filled reservoir: temporal variability over 2 consecutive years	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH												Seasonal and spatial variations in bacterial abundance, biomass and production in a recently flooded reservoir were followed for 2 consecutive years, in conjunction with phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll a) and activity (primary production). Between the 2 years of the study, the mean value of primary production remained constant, while those of the chlorophyll a concentration, bacterial abundance (BA), bacterial biomass (BB) and bacterial production (BP) decreased. The observed trends of the bacterial variables were linked to changes in the relative importance of allochthonous dissolved organic matter. Moreover, this factor would explain discrepancies observed between the slope of the model II regression equations established from results of the present study and those of the predictive models from the literature, relating to bacterial and phytoplankton variables. An estimate of the carbon budget indicated that 22 and 5% of the ambient primary production in the Sep Reservoir might be channeled through the microbial loop via BP during the 1st and 2nd year of the study, respectively. We conclude that heterotrophic BP in the Sep Reservoir may, on occasion, represent a significant source of carbon for higher order consumers.

J	BREAKER, LC; GEMMILL, WH; CROSBY, DS				BREAKER, LC; GEMMILL, WH; CROSBY, DS			THE APPLICATION OF A TECHNIQUE FOR VECTOR CORRELATION TO PROBLEMS IN METEOROLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY												In a recent study, Crosby et al. proposed a definition for vector correlation that has not been commonly used in meteorology or oceanography. This definition has both a firm theoretical basis and a rather complete set of desirable statistical properties. In this study, the authors apply the definition to practical problems arising in meteorology and oceanography. In the first of two case studies, vector correlations were calculated between subsurface currents for five locations along the southeastern shore of Lake Erie. Vector correlations for one sample size were calculated for all current meter combinations, first including the seiche frequency and then with the seiche frequency removed. Removal of the seiche frequency, which was easily detected in the current spectra, had only a small effect on the vector correlations. Under reasonable assumptions, the vector correlations were in most cases statistically significant and revealed considerable fine structure in the vector correlation sequences. In some cases, major variations in vector correlation coincided with changes in surface wind. The vector correlations for the various current meter combinations decreased rapidly with increasing spatial separation. For one current meter combination, canonical correlations were also calculated; the first canonical correlation tended to retain the underlying trend, whereas the second canonical correlation retained the peaks in the vector correlations. In the second case study, vector correlations were calculated between marine surface winds derived from the National Meteorological Center's Global Data Assimilation System and observed winds acquired from the network of National Data Buoy Center buoys that are located off the continental United States and in the Gulf of Alaska. Results of this comparison indicated that 1) there was a significant decrease in correlation between the predicted and observed winds with increasing forecast interval out to 72 h, 2) the technique provides a sensitive indicator for detecting bad buoy reports, and 3)there was no obvious seasonal cycle in the monthly vector correlations for the period of observation.																			0894-8763					NOV	1994	33	11					1354	1365		10.1175/1520-0450(1994)033<1354:TAOATF>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0450(1994)033<1354:TAOATF>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1994PN48000011

The size-abundance distribution was dominated by medium-sized phytoplankton cells (Gymnodinium cf. excavatum, Tetraselmis apiculata, Dunaliella spe. and several diatom species), large ciliates (Fabrea salina) and a few zooplankton species adapted to changing temporary environments within a wide size range (Cletocamptus retrogressus, Moina salina, Branchinella spinosa). This polymodal size distribution is compared with results obtained in other systems, including small physically controlled lakes, large lakes, oceans and marine benthos. Consideration of the size structure within homogeneous groups of organisms shows slopes less negative than the average for the whole size range analyzed, a feature which is common in small and physically controlled ecosystems. A seasonal study of the size structure revealed uneven distributions throughout the year, resulting in discontinuities in the size spectra as well as in differences of total size range. There were noticeable differences among the size spectra at each particular time, showing phases of primary producer predominance and phases with a marked predominance of consumers. The time-integrated size spectrum did not exhibit any distinct discontinuity. The influence of extreme shallowness and resuspension on the shape and dynamics of the size spectrum is examined and discussed compared to deeper aquatic systems.

This was demonstrated using NOAA AVHRR, and in situ temperature and chlorophyll fluorescence data to describe the seasonal temperature cycle and distribution of algal biomass in Lake Baikal (Russia). Features such as ice cover, thermal fronts, and the dispersion of river water were described in a series of images from 1990 and 1991. The northern basin retained ice cover until the end of May. In June, thermal fronts extending <10 km from shore were observed to be associated with shallows, bays, and rivers. Offshore surface temperatures in the northern basin did not exceed 4 degrees C until late June-early July. The southern and middle basins warmed more quickly than the northern basin. In situ data showed phytoplankton concentrations to be low off-shore and high near thermal fronts. The Selenga River, the largest tributary of Lake Baikal, supplied warm water and nutrients which contributed to localized increases in chlorophyll fluorescence.

A detailed study of seasonal variations using Principal Components Analysis (PCA) for the most relevant metals (Fe, Mn and Cd) was performed, assisted by the MINTEQA2 geochemical equilibrium program using 15 water abiotic parameters. The abiotic variables and metals in the lake were governed by the hydrological regimen of the Parana River and by the occurrence of occasional flood pulses and rainfall. The occurrence of cadmium is a concern; its presence could be due to industrial or agricultural activities or even to a natural geochemical process.

At WL and HF additional sets of plots were also treated with HNO3 (1000 mol(c) ha(-1) yr(-1)). Soil solutions were sampled at 15 and 50-cm depths. Changes in the S constituents of the soil were evaluated by buried mineral soil bags installed below the forest floor, Additions of SO42- increased solution SO42- and total S and phosphate-extractable SO42- in soil, Although organic S constituted >71% of the total soil S, no treatment effects on organic S were found, The response of SO42- was not influenced by the form of addition, Extractable sulfate and soil solution SO42- both increased with increases of (NH4)(2)SO4. For the three hardwood sites (WL, PHC, and HF), there was a positive relationship (P < 0.05) between soil solution SO42- concentration at 15 cm and extractable SO42- in soil bags, suggesting that these Haplorthod soils responded similarly to S inputs, For the Typic Udipsamment at PF, beneath red pine (Pinus resinosa Aiton), no such relationship was found, The similarity of response of Haplorthod soils suggests that similar soils across the Adirondack Mountains will show synchronous responses to S inputs.

All grazing experiments were conducted with predators starved for 24 hr. Cyclidium sp. was fixed with Glutaraldehyde and Tetrahymena corlissi with mercuric chlorid in order to reduce counting errors. The Incipient Limit Level (ILL) for Tetrahymena corlissi was reached at the initial concentration of 76000 cell l(-1) and corresponded to an ingestion rate of 340 cell ind(-1) h(-1); that for Cyclidium sp. was reached at 12000 cell l(-1) with an ingestion rate of 54 cell ind(-1) h(-1). The detection experiments were based on visual observations of Cyclops movements in experimental chambers with prey concentrations corresponding to the ILL. Both ciliates were used to evaluate the mechanisms involved in the detection of prey by Cyclops vicinus. Direct observations showed that Tetrahymena corlissi had a significant attractive effect on C. vicinus. Such behavior suggests that mechanoreception may be the overriding mechanism of remote detection. In contrast, C. vicinus does not react to the presence of Cyclidium sp. (at low concentration). These small prey, which swim actively in comparison with T. corlissi, are preyed on haphazardly. Ciliates can be a significant part of the diet of Cyclops vicinus, confirming their importance as mediators for energy transfer from the microbial loop to higher trophic levels; the mechanism of detection of such motile prey by Cyclops vicinus varies with prey swimming behavior.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1998	374						157	167		10.1023/A:1017001725062	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017001725062													WOS:000076609900014
J	Wudneh, SM				Wudneh, Solomon Mekuria			Livestock Owners' Perception on the Impact of Ghibe-III Hydroelectric Dam on Bovine Trypanosomosis, Southern Ethiopia	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH INSIGHTS												BACKGROUND: Trypanosomosis is an endemic livestock disease in Ethiopia. The problem prevails mainly in the South, Southwest, and Northwest regions following main rivers and their tributaries. METHODS: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted in Loma and Kindo Didaye districts near the Ghibe-III hydroelectric dam. to compare dam impact upstream and downstream. from January 2019 to June 2020. Two hundred standardized questionnaire surveys were administered. The questionnaire included biography. livestock population before and after dam construction, knowledge of major livestock diseases. clinical signs. transmission, seasonality, and wildlife population status was assessed. Data were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U Test. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: A total of 189 questionnaires were returned out of 200 questionnaires administered. Among the respondents, the majorities were males and had an average age of 39.4 + 10.6. In all herd size levels. there was no significant (P> .05) difference before dam construction between the 2 districts; whereas. statistically significant (P< .05) large and medium herd sizes increased by 16%(95% CI: 0.5. 31.5) after dam construction in Loma district; whereas. the same herd size reduced by 20%(95% CI:0,43.7) after dam construction with statistically significant(P< .05) difference. Bovine trypanosomosis ranked first among major diseases. Knowledge of clinical signs. transmission. and seasonality of trypanosomosis was consistent with the literature. 87.8% of respondents in Loma associated reduction of trypanosomosis and tsetse population, but 77% of Kindo Didaye respondents perceived no change in prevalence after dam construction. More reduction in wildlife population was observed upstream than downstream, health services improved, and disease outbreaks and cattle deaths were reduced. Studies in African countries indicate the reduction in tsetse apparent density and absences of wildlife contributed to the reduction of trypanosomosis. CONCLUSION: An increased herd size. reduced trypanosomosis prevalence. and wildlife population observed upstream, indicate artificial Lake has an impact on tsetse apparent density. Therefore, follow-up of the disease prevalence and investigation of drug resistance is recommended to prove the situation in the study area.																			1178-6302					OCT	2022	16								11786302221127266	10.1177/11786302221127266	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/11786302221127266								36210861					WOS:000865292300001

It is centered on the biomass of three dominant species of submerged aquatic plants in Lake Geneva. The first part deals with changes in shoot biomass during the growing period (April to October 1991 ), using sampling quadrats of 0.25 m2. Potamogeton lucens L. presented the longest vegetation period (198 days), followed by Potamogeton perfoliatus L. (171 days) and Potamogeton pectinatus L. (127 days). The maximum biomass was reached by P. lucens with a dry weight of 325 g m-2 on the 136th day, followed by P. perfoliatus (196 g m-2, 118th day) and P. pectinatus (150 g m-2, 95th day). The relationship between the index of vegetation density and biomass appears to be linear for the three species. However, the relationship between depth and biomass can be fitted by a parabola with observed maxima of 215 g m-2 at 2.6 m depth for P. pectinatus, 359 g m-2 at 3.1 m for P. lucens, and 228 g m-2 at 3.8 m for P. perfoliatus. These results, together with aerial photography interpretation and echosounder survey, were used to estimate the spatial and temporal distribution of biomass by means of the GIS. Finally, this work presents a three-dimensional model of the littoral zone, based on a perspective view of GIS information layers draped over a digital elevation model. It gives a mean to visualize the architectural changes-that occurred throughout the vegetation season. These changes are caused by the growth, blooming and death of the plants, and result in important modifications in the ecosystem spatial structure which, in tum, influences the physical and chemical balance and life cycle of many animals and plants. It appears that GIS represents an interesting and powerful tool for the study and management of lake littoral ecosystems.

Pituitary cells containing inducible P4501A1 were identified by double immunostaining as gonadotrophs containing gonadotropin II. Thus, the pituitary gonadotrophs may be target cells for polyaromatic hydrocarbons. Elevated plasma levels of gonadotropin II (GTH II) and testosterone in the induced fish indicated that the functioning of the pituitary was disturbed. Because GTH II regulate the final stage of sexual maturation the results implies that exposure to P4501A1 inducing compounds may disturb this development stage.																			0303-7207	1872-8057				FEB	1993	91	1-2					99	105		10.1016/0303-7207(93)90260-Q	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0303-7207(93)90260-Q								8472859					WOS:A1993KL63500014

Temporal Analysis of the Flows of the Rivers that form the Hydrographic Basin of Moquegua (Peru)	FLUCTUATION AND NOISE LETTERS												The study of water sources such as rivers and lakes is increasingly important in the modern world, mainly due to their scarcity and the large number of cities flooded by heavy rains. In this paper, we aim to analyze the dynamics of the daily flow of water in the Torata, Tumilaca, and Huaracane rivers, which form the Moquegua watershed (Peru). To study these fluctuations, we apply the DFA method (estimate long-range autocorrelation in non-stationary time series) and the DCCA cross correlation coefficient (which strongly dominates the standard Pearson coefficient in time series analysis) to analyze the flow in the basin of Moquegua. Among the rivers that we analyzed descriptively, we identified greater variability in flows in the Huaracane River and less in the Torata, and in general a seasonal component of approximately one year. With the modeling via DFA, it was possible to identify persistent behavior and also annual seasonality. With the DCCA coefficient (cross correlation), as a function of the time scale, positive values of cross correlation are found between river flows at different levels (weak, medium, strong). With this study, considering the properties of the applied methods, it is possible to predict the oscillations of one river in relation to another, which can help the authorities in the management of freshwater over time.

Total average number of crustacean plankton varied from 36 to 126 ind 1(-1), their biomass from 0.49 to 1.86 mg ww 1(-1) month (-1) at different areas of the littoral zone. In general these values for the above parameters were higher in hypertrophic areas. 23 fish species occurred in the littoral zone with cyprinids dominating. The seasonal food spectra of Y-O-Y roach (Rutilus rutilus), white bream (Blicca bjoerkna) and bream (Abramis brama) were based mainly on planktonic crustaceans and benthic/periphytic invertebrates. According to the frequency of occurrence of crustaceans and other invertebrates, the food composition of young cyprinids differed significantly in the NE and SW-basins of the lake.

In recent past, there has been a severe decline in Schizothoracine population due to uncontrolled anthropogenic activities and climate change. Therefore, there is an urgent need for critical analysis of annual gonadal development in Schizothorax species. In this study, the seasonal variations of testicular architecture and development were examined in adult S. plagiostomus at Garhwal Himalaya, Uttarakhand, India. Testicular -somatic index were found to be ranged from 0.254 +/- 0.06-7.104 +/- 1.62 with maximal value recorded in September-October and minimal in April-May. Testicular histology revealed abundance of undifferentiated spermatogonia, meiotic spermatid and spermatozoa in pre-spawning and spawning capable phases respectively. The ultra-structure of spermatozoa showed 1.78 +/- 0.27 mu m long ovoid shaped head without any acrosome, 0.35 +/- 0.05 mu m long ellipsoidal mid-piece and 22.5 +/- 0.65 mu m long flagella. We further have evaluated the milt/ semen volume, estimated the sperm density and motility in male brooders. Notably the spermatogenic capacity was found to be consistent in two breeding seasons e.g. spawning capable (September-October) and residual spawning (February-March) phases. In summary, this is the first comprehensive qualitative and quantitative report of the seasonal variations of the spermatogenic output in adult male S. plagiostomus. This data may provide valuable information for the conservation management and artificial breeding program of S. plagiostomus.

Special attention was paid to heterotrophic bacteria and the factors influencing their production and biomass development. The average proportions of the biomass of phytoplankton, zooplankton, and bacteria were 17:2:1 on a carbon basis. Phytoplankton primary production averaged 580 mg C m-2,d-1, and 22% of the fixed carbon was exuded. Bacterial production, estimated by frequency of dividing cells, averaged 160 mg C m-2 d-1 and equalled 25% of the gross primary production on a seasonal basis. Increased bacterial activity was either correlated with increased exudation or followed a collapse in the phytoplankton community. Grazing was estimated to amount to 35-180% and 41-84% of the total losses of phytoplankton and bacteria. Cladocerans were the main grazers on phytoplankton, and heterotrophic flagellates were the main grazers on bacteria. Because of high death rates of zooplankton and cycling of carbon within the microbial loop, the available substrate of bacteria equalled the primary production on a seasonal basis. Exudates, egestion products from grazers, and dead zooplankton constituted two-thirds of the available substrate, and these sources were of equal magnitude.

Warming overcomes dispersal-limitation to promote non-native expansion in Lake Baikal	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Non-native species and climate change pose serious threats to global biodiversity. However, the roles of climate, dispersal, and competition are difficult to disentangle in heterogeneous landscapes. We combine empirical data and theory to examine how these forces influence the spread of non-native species in Lake Baikal. We analyze the potential for Daphnia longispina to establish in Lake Baikal, potentially threatening an endemic, cryophillic copepod Epischurella baikalensis. We collected field samples to establish current community composition and compared them to model predictions informed by flow rates, present-day temperatures, and temperature projections. Our data and model agree that expansion is currently limited by dispersal. However, projected increases in temperature reverse this effect, allowing D. longispina to establish in Lake Baikal's main basin. A strong negative impact emerges from the interaction between cli-mate change and dispersal, outweighing their independent effects. Climate, dispersal, and competition have complex, interactive effects on expansion with important implications for global biodiversity.(c) 2022 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

Variability in fish and water hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope values in the nearshore region of a large water body	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Incorporating organismal hydrogen (delta 2H or delta D) and oxygen (delta 18O) stable isotope ratios into aquatic food web research can help elucidate relative reliance on shoreline inputs and/or feeding at different trophic levels; however, their interpretation is complicated by the fact that aquatic organisms derive hydrogen and oxygen from both their diet and the ambient water in which they reside. We examined spatial and seasonal patterns in delta 2H and delta 18O of field-collected water and small-bodied fishes. Samples were gathered from nearshore Lake Michigan, a dynamic region of a large, increasingly oligotrophic freshwater lake. We examined seasonal and spatial delta 2H and delta 18O values of surface and bottom water, and compared spatial delta 2H and delta 18O values of young-of-year yellow perch (Perca flavescens) and seasonal delta 2H and delta 18O values of round goby (Neogobius melanostomus). Nearshore delta 2H and delta 18O water values were more variable than previously-described offshore values. Variation in nearshore water delta 2H and delta 18O values was likely related to differential precipitation and/or discharges from tributaries, and there may be a surface dilu-tion effect which led to lower delta 18O values in nearshore surface waters than bottom waters. In our study, fish tissue delta 2H and delta 18O also varies more spatially than seasonally, and some findings suggest that fish tissue delta 2H may reflect feeding at higher trophic levels. Though characteristics of the study system affect their interpretation, we suggest that delta 2H and delta 18O can be another tool to assess food web structure, with delta 2H in particular having potential to resolve questions when delta 13C or delta 15N are inconclusive.(c) 2022 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

J	Scott, DM; Wilson, RW				Scott, D. M.; Wilson, R. W.			Three species of fishes from an eutrophic, seasonally alkaline lake are not more tolerant to acute exposure to high pH in the laboratory	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												A number of different freshwater fish species (perch Perca fluviatilis, roach Rutilus rutilus and rudd Scardinius erythrophthalamus) from either eutrophic (Slapton Ley, a seasonally alkaline lake) or non-eutrophic waters were compared with respect to their sodium uptake kinetics and tolerance to acute (1 h) exposure to pH 9.5. Further comparisons were made with rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss and brown trout Salmo trutta. The influence of fish size was also investigated in rainbow trout. Exposure to pH 9.5 was found to disrupt sodium balance and inhibit ammonia excretion in all species and sizes of fishes. The origin of fishes did not have a significant effect on the sodium uptake kinetics or the physiological responses to high pH water. The fishes from the eutrophic lake therefore did not appear to have any increased tolerance to acute exposure to alkaline water. In contrast to previous studies there was no inhibition of Na+ uptake during exposure to high pH. Indeed in some groups of fish Na+ uptake was actually stimulated, as was Na+ efflux. These differences are attributed to experimental water composition and interspecific differences in physiology. It was not always possible to size-match fishes of the different species, so rainbow trout were used to assess the effect of body mass (from 2 to 40 g), on Na+ uptake kinetics and Na+ or ammonia fluxes during alkaline water exposure in rainbow trout. Size had no significant effect on these measurements within this narrow range, which helps validate the comparison between species in this study.																			0022-1112	1095-8649				FEB	2007	70	2					551	566		10.1111/j.1095-8649.2007.01329.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8649.2007.01329.x													WOS:000243976700018

Red Lakes drum mature at approximately age 9 and can live to be over 60 years old. The ovarian development of drum from its northern limit of distribution is described histologically. The stages of oocyte growth and the seasonal change in the proportion of oocyte stages within the ovaries are presented. Drum ovaries contained a continuum of oocyte sizes and at spawning, only the largest oocytes are ovulated. A large percentage of the oocytes became atretic mid-way through the spawning season, while gonadosomatic indexes were still high. This may have reduced the spawning potential of Red Lakes drum.

This paper discusses the shortcomings in the conservation of migratory game animals in 'island' parks when they also utilize adjoining private/public lands as part of their seasonal migration pattern, using Lake Manyara National Park as a case study. The Park is very small, but important biologically, economically, and aesthetically, and is of great tourist interest. It may not be viable in the long term because of its increasing isolation by agricultural settlement. A strategy involving corridors and buffer zones, and economic incentives for conservation, is proposed in order to reconcile conservation and development.																			0006-3207						1991	57	2					171	186		10.1016/0006-3207(91)90137-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0006-3207(91)90137-X													WOS:A1991GA67200004
J	SMITH, JB				SMITH, JB			THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE GREAT-LAKES	BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												Global climate change could have a significant impact on the Great Lakes. A number of studies of the potential effects of climate change on the Great Lakes were commissioned by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, using common scenarios of global warming derived mainly from general circulation models. These studies found that a doubling of carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere could eventually lower Great Lakes water levels by 0.5 to 2.5m; reduce ice cover by 1 to 2 1/2 months; lengthen shipping seasons while increasing shipping and dredging costs; reduce dissolved oxygen levels in shallow lake basins; and increase fish productivity. Measures should be taken in the near future to anticipate many of these impacts and mitigate their effects or avoid costly political issues.																			0003-0007					JAN	1991	72	1					21	28		10.1175/1520-0477(1991)072<0021:TPIOCC>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0477(1991)072<0021:TPIOCC>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1991EY14800002
J	Timmerman, NA				Timmerman, Nicholas A.			A city and a water crisis: Flint, Michigan and the 1950/1960s water crisis	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES AND SCIENCES												The city of Flint and the Flint River has a long history of pollution, industrial waste, mismanagement of ecosystems, and issues of access to clean water that were significant factors in water management decisions for the city's residents. In the 1950s and 1960s, the industrial and residential pollution control demands placed on the Flint River exceeded the river's capacity. Particularly, the city needed to provide clean water to residents and an adequate flow rate to remove pollution from the very same water source. Many reasons emerged for the water crisis of the 1950s and 1960s, namely a rapid increase in population and demand for industrial growth, which taxed the city's water and sewage infrastructure beyond its limits. During this era, city government took steps to increase pollution mitigation plans, increase river water flow rates, and develop reservoirs to store water reserves for use during high-demand seasons. One of the massive infrastructure plans included constructing a direct water pipeline to Lake Huron to provide Flint residents with an abundant clean water supply from one of the Great Lakes. Nonetheless, many plans enacted proved inadequate to address the immediate water emergency, and infrastructure plans such as constructing the water pipeline to Lake Huron failed to materialize, which could have prevented the Flint Water Crisis of the 2010s.

A combination of lake sediment dredging and capping, oxygenation, and a recirculating wetland have reduced lake water column P levels by nearly 50%, as compared to pre-project levels. Key to this result has been the dampening of seasonal P recycling in the sediments. A new lake water quality numerical model is presented, with applications to both pre- and post-project conditions. Model auditing has revealed very good results with respect to predicting mitigation impacts on P but poor results with respect to predicting the performance, or lack thereof, of the N mitigation system. Model sensitivity analyses indicate that the P reductions are primarily attributable to the sediment dredging and capping. Conversely, seasonal data, supported by modeling, suggest that the poor performance of the N mitigation system may be attributable to incomplete removal, or sequestration, of sediment N mass during dredging and/or a lack of impact from the oxygenation system. Future mitigation efforts for the lake should focus on reducing the substantial watershed nutrient loads to the lake and further in-lake P inactivation.																				2616-6518				SEP	2022	5	3					515	531		10.2166/h2oj.2022.025	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/h2oj.2022.025													WOS:000862139400009

Bilong			Inventory and Ecological Characterization of Ichthyofauna of Nine Lakes in the Adamawa Region (Northern Cameroon, Central Africa)	DIVERSITY-BASEL												The fish diversity of the Adamawa lakes is among the most undocumented in Northern Cameroon. Faced with this lack of knowledge, an inventory of ichthyofauna and habitats characterization was conducted in nine lakes. Seven lakes (Assom, Gegouba, Massote, Mbalang, Ngaoundaba, Piou and Tizong) are located in the Sanaga Basin and two (Bini and Dang) are located in the Lake Chad Basin. In order to assess the composition and variation in fish assemblage, eight sampling campaigns were carried out seasonally between 2017 and 2018; they revealed 26 species of fish distributed in 6 orders, 9 families and 16 genera. Communities in Lakes Assom (13 species) and Bini (9 species) were the most diverse. Omnivorous (42.3%) and spawners in open water or on substrates of sand, gravel, rock or plants (69.2%) were the most represented. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling, analysis of similarities (ANOSIM), and similarity percentage analysis (SIMPER) revealed that fish species composition differed significantly among lakes. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) identified temperature, pH, TDS, and conductivity as variables explaining the most variation in fish species. The presence of four endemic species in the Sanaga Basin in lakes Assom, Gegouba, Massote and Piou, shows that these lakes stand out as hotspots for conservation due to the uniqueness of their ichthyofauna.

Production and relative growth rates of leaves of Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers., Cynodon plectostachyus (K. Schum.) Pilg. and Sporobolus spicatus (Vahl) Kunth were generally highest during the short rains, lower during the long rains and negligible during the long dry season. The grass Chloris gayana Kunth showed its peak in production and consumption in the dry season. The concentration of crude protein in the green leaves reflected this pattern of growth and was highest during periods of vigorous growth. Green leaves always had a higher crude protein concentration than green stalk, and green parts than dead parts. Cyperus laevigatus L. did not show marked seasonality in its production pattern or in the crude protein concentration in its green parts. The diet, as determined through faecal analyses, reflected grass species high in protein, except during the dry season when the buffalo concentrated on the sedge, which had a low protein concentration but which offered a dense sward enabling them to collect sufficient food. The concentration of crude protein in the diet was determined through faecal nitrogen determination. The quality of the diet showed a clear seasonality, at the end of the dry season approaching the minimum requirements for maintenance. The crude protein concentration showed that the buffalo consumed a combination of species and species parts, so that they ingested a balanced diet with regard to their requirements for protein and energy.

Although the study sites in both regions spanned a pH range from approximately 4.5 to 6.4, considerably greater seasonal variability in pH and higher monomeric Al concentrations characterized the Adirondack sites. Relationships between several biological characteristics and stream water acidity were similar in both regions, including lower production of epilithic bacteria and bacteria on decomposing leaves, lower leaf decomposition rates, lower density and generic richness of scraper/grazer macroinvertebrates, particularly Ephemeroptera, and lower fish abundance and survival in more acidic streams. Densities of total macroinvertebrates and densities of macroinvertebrates and bacteria inhabiting or closely associated with stream sediments were generally not related to stream water acidity. Regional differences occur in some of the relationships between biological characteristics and stream water acidity. Negative correlations between bacterial production on rocks and pH, between bacterial production on decomposing leaves and pH, and between densities of Ephemeroptera and scrapers and pH were stronger in the Adirondacks than in the Southern Blue Ridge. Higher Al concentrations in the Adirondacks may be responsible for the stronger relationships with pH there. The steeper slopes of the relationships between Ephemeroptera density and all forms of Al in the Adirondacks compared with the Southern Blue Ridge suggests that there may be some adaptation among a few acid/aluminum-tolerant species in the seasonally more constant acidic Southern Blue Ridge streams. Fish bioassays indicated longer survival times in acidic streams in the Adirondacks compared with the Southern Blue Ridge, but these results may be an artifact associated with the use in the Southern Blue Ridge of rainbow trout as the test species which is known to be more acid sensitive compared with brook trout, the test species used in the Adirondacks.					; Mulholland, Patrick/C-3142-2012; Driscoll, Charles T./F-9832-2014; Rosemond, Amy/I-2688-2018; Driscoll, Charles/F-9832-2014; Palumbo, Anthony/A-4764-2011	Palumbo, Anthony/0000-0002-1102-3975; Driscoll, Charles T./0000-0003-2692-2890; Rosemond, Amy/0000-0003-4299-9353; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP 4	1992	239	1					7	24		10.1007/BF00027525	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00027525													WOS:A1992JN34800002

In general, aquatic plants are widely distributed and have a large-scale ability to disperse. However, some groups have narrower tolerance and are more sensitive to local environmental variations. Thus, we investigated which factors explain the spatial distribution of growth forms in different seasonal pools in the Brazilian semi-arid region. We hypothesized that if dispersal limitation is absent and pools have similar abiotic conditions, all pools must have communities with the same growth form pattern that fit together in the water column. Conversely, if the abiotic factors among pools differ significantly, there will be a higher frequency of certain growth forms associated with the most striking local factors. We found no relationship between growth form composition in pools and geographic distance (rM = -0.004; P = 0.96), indicating high dispersal capacity. Nonetheless, the pool showed different growth forms proportions, indicating that different abiotic factors affect each local. Additionally, the variation explained by the abiotic factors was higher than the distance. Nitrate, ammonia, cation exchange capacity and redox potential were the main environmental variables related to the presence of growth forms. Helophytes and bottom-rooted emergent hydrophytes were positively associated with nitrate and redox potential, whereas bottom-rooted submerged hydrophytes were positively associated with ammonia. Unpredictably, free-floating emergent hydrophytes were more frequent in pools with high cation exchange capacity. This association may come from a nutrient flux integrated system between soil and water. Our results suggest that the effect of abiotic factors is stronger than dispersal limitation on the growth forms composition in Brazilian semi-arid pools, and the frequency of growth forms in each pool depends on the role most striking (or joint) of the local limnological and edaphic variables.

J	Yanni, S; Keys, K; Clair, TA; Arp, PA				Yanni, S; Keys, K; Clair, TA; Arp, PA			Fog and acidification impacts on ion budgets of basins in Nova Scotia, Canada	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												We examined hydrogeochemical records for a dozen watersheds in and near Kejimkujik National Park in southwestern Nova Scotia by relating stream ion concentrations and fluxes to atmospheric deposition, stream type (lake inlet versus outlet; brown versus clear water), and watershed type (catchment area, topography, soils, and dominant forest cover type). We found that fog and dry deposition make important contributions to S, N, Cl, H, Ca, Mg, K, and Na inputs into these watersheds. Seasalt chloride deposition from rain, snow, fog, and dry deposition equal total stream outputs on a region-wide basis. Chloride outputs, however, differ among watersheds by a factor of about two, likely due to local differences in air now and vegetational fog interception. We found that most of the incoming N is absorbed by the vegetation, as stream water NO3- and NH4+ are very low. Our results also show that the vegetation and the soils absorb about half of the incoming SO4-2. In comparison with other North American watersheds with similar forest vegetation, Ca outputs are low, while Mg and K outputs are similar to other regions. Soil exchangeable Ca and soil cation exchange capacity are also very low. We found that first-order forest streams with no upstream lakes have a distinct seasonal pattern that neither corresponds with the seasonal pattern of atmospheric deposition, nor with the seasonal pattern of downstream lake outlets.																			1093-474X					JUN	2000	36	3					619	631		10.1111/j.1752-1688.2000.tb04292.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2000.tb04292.x													WOS:000087844600014

A total of 1 452 specimens were obtained (monthly samples). Females represented 60.12 %, males 34.98 % and the young 4.89 % of the population. Overall sex ratio was 1.7: 1 in favor of females (chi(2) p<0.05). The size at first reproduction for females was 27 mm and for males 22 mm (standard lengths); multiple spawning occurred throughout the reproductive cycle (from March through May and July through October) primarily, during the rainy season. There was evidence of breeding activity throughout the year. In July the gonadosomatic index mean was highest (4.7%). The number of embryos in the ovaries were between 5 and 78, with a mean fertility of 23, the fertility was associated with standard length with determination coefficients above 93.22 percent. There was a direct relationship between specimen length and weight, and the asymptotic size for males was 64 mm and for females 81 mm (standard lengths).

J	MUOTKA, T				MUOTKA, T			MICROHABITAT USE BY PREDACEOUS STREAM INSECTS IN RELATION TO SEASONAL-CHANGES IN PREY AVAILABILITY	ANNALES ZOOLOGICI FENNICI												Seasonal variation in microhabitat use of the predaceous stream insects Diura nanseni (Plecoptera), and Rhyacophila nubila and R. obliterata (Trichoptera) was studied in northern Finland. Samples were taken in May, August and October from a 2nd order forest stream, and in June and July from a lake outlet where R. obliterata was the only predatory species. Prey, especially simuliid and chironomid larvae, were aggregated on all sampling occasions at both sites. D. nanseni aggregated only in August, and prey availability did not affect its microhabitat use. R. nubila was most strongly aggregated in October and May, favouring stones with high numbers of sedentary prey which also formed the major part of its diet on all sampling occasions. R. obliterata aggregated where simuliids, its most important prey, were abundant. Microhabitat selection and aggressive defence by the prey, and mutual interference between the predators, are suggested as reasons for the lack of aggregative response by D. nanseni. In contrast, both rhyacophilid species aggregated strongly to microhabitats with temporarily high avail ability of semi-sessile prey.

J	Cerna, L; Espinosa, MER; Yu, PQ				Cerna, Linda; Espinosa, Maria E. Rodriguez; Yu, Peiqiang			Effect of cool-season adapted chickpea varieties on physicochemical and nutritional characteristics in ruminant systems	ANIMAL FEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The focus of this study was to evaluate the effect of varieties on structural, physicochemical, and nutritional characteristics of cool-season adapted chickpeas as an alternative source for protein and energy feed for ruminant livestock. The hypothesis of this study was that cool-season adapted CDC chickpeas varieties grown in Western Canada would have significant differences in nutritional characteristics and truly nutrient supply to dairy livestock. The Crop Development Center (CDC) at the University of Saskatchewan (Saskatoon, Canada) provided the experimental samples of cool-season adapted chickpeas used in this study. Three chickpea varieties, CDC Alma, CDC Cory, and CDC Frontier were collected from three locations in Saskatchewan: Elorse, Limerick, and Lucky Lake. The standard official methods from the Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) were used for chemical analyses. Energy parameters were deter-mined using the NRC dairy-2001. An in situ technique in cannulated cows was used to evaluate rumen degradation kinetics. Intestinal digestibility was determined in vitro using the 12 h re-sidual samples from in situ incubations. A randomized complete block design (RCBD) with variety as a fixed effect and location as a random effect was used for statistical analyses using the MIXED model procedure of SAS 9.4. Significance was declared at P < 0.05 and tendencies at 0.05 < P < 0.10. Varieties CDC Alma and CDC Cory had a higher carbohydrate content than CDC Frontier (P = 0.02). Conversely, CDC Frontier had higher crude protein (CP) (P = 0.02) and SCP (soluble crude protein) (P = 0.02) than the other chickpeas. The rumen undegraded crude protein (RUP) was higher in CDC Alma and CDC Frontier compared to CDC Cory (P = 0.01). The intestinal digested crude protein (IDP) was higher in CDC Frontier than CDC Alma and CDC Cory (P = 0.03). No differences were observed in the true protein supply (DVE value), metabolizable protein (MP), and Feed Milk Value (FMV) between the three CDC varieties (P > 0.05). In conclusion, the chemical and nutrient profiles, rumen degradation kinetics, intestinal digestibility, and true nutrient availability in lactating cows among the cool-season adapted CDC chickpea varieties have been obtained. The cool-season adapted CDC chickpea varieties had > 770 g/kg EDCP and < 230 g/kg RUCP. CDC Frontier showed better results with relatively higher CP, higher degraded protein balance (OEB, DPB), higher truly digestive protein nutrient supply (DVE, MP) to dairy cows, and higher FMV than other two varieties. In general, cool-season CDC chickpea varieties grown in western Canada can be used as an alternative energy and protein nutrient option for ruminants.

Ellen			Seasonal and annual dynamics of western Canadian boreal forest plant communities: A legacy data set spanning four decades	ECOLOGY												As boreal forests rapidly warm due to anthropogenic climate change, long-term baseline community data are needed to effectively characterize the corresponding ecological changes that are occurring in these forests. The combined seasonal dynamics (SEADYN) and annual dynamics (ANNDYN) data set, which documents the vegetative changes in boreal forests during the snow-free period, is one such source of baseline community data. These data were collected by George H. La Roi and colleagues in Alberta, Canada from 1980 to 2015 within permanent sampling plots established in the Hondo-Slave Lake area (eight stands; 1980-2015) in central Alberta and the Athabasca Oil Sands (AOS) region (17 stands; 1981-1984) near Fort McMurray in northeastern Alberta. Various data were collected, with temporal and spatial coverage differing by data set. These data sets include, but are not limited to, cover of each identified vascular plant and bryoid (moss, liverwort, and lichen) species; forest mensuration; forest litter production; and soil temperature and moisture. Notably, permanent sampling plots were set up as a grid, which will facilitate analyses of spatial relations. These data can be used to analyze long-term changes in seasonal dynamics and succession within boreal forest communities and serve as a baseline for comparison with future forest conditions in unmanaged, managed, and reclaimed forests.

J	Dou, HT; Gmitter, FG				Dou, Huating; Gmitter, Fred G.			Postharvest quality and acceptance of LB8-9 mandarin as a fresh fruit cultivar	HORTTECHNOLOGY												A new mandarin cultivar currently designated as selection LB8-9 ['Clementine' mandarin (Citrus reticulata) x 'Minneola' tangeto, Duncan grapefruit (Citrus paradisi) x Dancy tangerine (C. reticulata)], soon to be released by the University of Florida, Citrus Research and Education Center, Lake Alfred, has been evaluated for postharvest fruit quality, and consumer acceptance. Comparisons were made with 'Sunburst' and Minneola' mandarins, which overlap the early and late LB8-9 maturity season, respectively. LB8-9 and 'Sunburst' fruit stored 2 weeks at 70 OF developed similar decay percentages (35% to 37%), while 'Minneola' showed only 16% decay. Postharvest pitting incidence was zero in LB8-9 and 'Minneola' and 3% in 'Sunburst' stored at 70 degrees F and 92% to 96% relative humidity (RH). At the same storage conditions, LB8-9 and 'Sunburst' developed better fruit peel color (hue = 60) in comparison with the 'Minnelola' (hue = 65) mandarin. No differences were found in fruit external peel color (hue angle), chilling injury, or decay among three cultivars stored at 40 degrees F after 6 weeks. However, juice color was the, best in 'Sunburst' as indicated by the highest color numbers (44), followed by LB8-9 (40) and 'Minneola' (38). Wax-formulation studies indicated that carnauba wax was the best formulation for coating LB8-9 because of low decay incidence, weight loss, and good color. No difference was found in fruit taste panels at day 6 after packing, while a better store of acceptance in the fruit taste panel was recorded for LB8-9 than 'Minneola' after 50 d of storage at 40 OF and 92% to 96% RH. LB8-9 fruit had. a higher soluble solids concentration [SSC (14.0)] and acid (1.12) than 'Minneola' or 'Sunburst' mandarins, both having a SSC and acid lower than 11.5 and 0.86, respectively. Sucrose concentration was noticeably higher in the new cultivar (7.14 g/100 mL) than in 'Minneola'(5.27 g/100 mL) or 'Sunburst' (6. 10 g/100 mL). Vitamin C concentration was 42.43 mg/100 mL for the new cultivar, which was considerably higher than 'Minneola'(23.27 mg/100 mL) or 'Sunburst'(26.25 mg/100 mL). Overall, LB8-9 has good potential as a new fresh fruit for the consumer, and no serious problems were noted with typical postharvest handling.

J	Guay, PJ; Mulder, R				Guay, P. J.; Mulder, R. A.			Skewed paternity distribution in the extremely size dimorphic Musk Duck (Biziura lobata)	EMU												Although most species of Anseriformes form long-term or seasonal pair-bonds and breed monogamously, some are thought to be polygynous. The Musk Duck (Biziura lobata) is unique among Anseriformes in that it has been suggested to have a lek mating system. Musk Ducks also display extreme size dimorphism and many secondary sexual traits whose functions are not clearly understood. We studied paternity in a resident population of Musk Ducks in order to explore the genetic mating system and to investigate the role of different male secondary sexual traits. We obtained blood samples from seven males, five breeding females and seven ducklings from six broods on Lake Wendouree, Ballarat, Australia, during the 2003 breeding season and used microsatellite markers to assign paternity to ducklings. Two of the seven sampled males fathered all of the ducklings in the five broods for which we could assign paternity. Both of these males were territorial and heavier, had larger lobes and displayed more frequently than the remaining males. They also produced a large amount of musk. Our results provide the first unequivocal genetic demonstration of polygyny occurring in a wild anseriform population. Discovery of polygyny in Musk Ducks corresponds well with previous field studies suggesting that they have a lek mating system. The skewed paternity distribution towards more ornamented and larger males also suggests that these traits may have evolved under sexual selection.																			0158-4197						2007	107	3					190	195		10.1071/MU07012	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MU07012													WOS:000249274700004
J	Nishi, Y; Tabeta, S				Nishi, Yoshiki; Tabeta, Shigeru			Sunlight and tidal interaction as a mechanism of carbon transport in an ice-covered region: Results of a coupled ice-ocean ecosystem model	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												In order to clarify the mechanism of carbon transport in an ice-covered ecosystem in Lake Saroma (44 degrees N, 14 degrees E, Hokkaido, Japan), a three-dimensional numerical calculation using a coupled ice-ocean ecosystem model was conducted. This model comprises an ocean ecosystem model, an ice ecosystem model, and equations for the coupling between ice and ocean. Comparisons of calculated results with observational data confirm that the calculation well reproduced the in situ phenomena with respect to tides, tidal currents, concentrations of POC and chlorophyll a in ice and in water, and sinking fluxes beneath the ice. The analysis of the organic carbon budget based on the calculation reveals that tide-induced transport, the enhancement of biological production in a pelagic system, and the physical release of organic matter from ice associated with ice-melting are important factors affecting the carbon transport during the ice-melting season. The carbon transport has a one-day time cycle. This is because principal driving forces are sunlight, and diurnal tides. The described mechanism of "sunlight and tidal pumping" is one of the most important features of carbon transport in a coupled ice-water ecosystem. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	TOTH, LA; OBEYSEKERA, JTB; PERKINS, WA; LOFTIN, MK				TOTH, LA; OBEYSEKERA, JTB; PERKINS, WA; LOFTIN, MK			FLOW REGULATION AND RESTORATION OF FLORIDA KISSIMMEE RIVER	REGULATED RIVERS-RESEARCH & MANAGEMENT												Channelization of the Kissimmee River in central Florida destroyed or degraded most of the fish and wildlife habitat once provided by the river and its floodplain wetlands. Between 1984 and 1989 a demonstration project was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of restoring the river's biological resources. Reintroduction of flow through remnant river channels improved river channel habitat diversity and led to favourable responses by fish and invertebrate communities. However, results indicated that more complete restoration of biological attributes will require the re-establishment of historical inflow characteristics. Owing to the flood control regulation schedule of its headwater lakes, current river discharge regimes are pulse-like, include extended periods of low or no flow, and have high and low flow periods which are out of phase compared with typical seasonal patterns that occurred before channelization. These flow characteristics will preclude effective river restoration by contributing to chronic low dissolved oxygen regimes and repetitive fish kills, interfering with fish reproduction and limiting floodplain inundation. Simulation modelling was used to develop a modified headwater lakes regulation schedule which re-establishes season flow patterns, smooths discharge peaks and maintains base flows for a greater portion of the year. Implementation of the new schedule, combined with extensive canal backfilling, will lead to discharge and stage characteristics that meet established criteria for achieving ecosystem restoration goals.

Whereas approaches based on teeth and bones offer limited dietary precision, the study of dung-derived plant remains provides a means of identifying the plant material included in livestock diet and, potentially, short-term changes in diet. The paper illustrates the archaeobotanical approach using an assemblage of charred plant remains from the Neolithic settlement of Jeitun in southern Turkmenistan. The results reveal local patterns in livestock diet and land use and have implications for understanding of the scale of animal husbandry and the seasonality of site occupation.																					1-84217-117-8				2005							93	103																WOS:000232917700013

Examining the influence of factors determining territory size simultaneously continues to be stressed in studies of territorial systems. The behavior of grebes breeding on small boreal lakes (15-240 ha) was examined in relation to several environmental variables through three stages of the breeding season (pre-nesting, nesting, and post-nesting). Territory size was shown to be inversely related to grebe density and fish abundance during the pre-nesting and nesting stages of the breeding season. In addition, grebe density was more strongly associated with territory size than was fish abundance. The costs and benefits that balance economic decisions for breeding grebes rigorously defending areas are discussed.																			0030-5685						2005	82	4					129	136																WOS:000234595000001

To investigate especially the time dependence and the effect of K-fertilisation on the TF, field experiments were conducted. Plots of 7.6 m(2) were labelled with 100 kBq Cs-134 m(-2) at Santa Rosa Experiment Station close to the city of Valdivia characterised by a temperate climate and high precipitation rates. The variation in time of the radiocaesium TF soil-to-Swiss chard was observed during two consecutive years after soil contamination by sequential harvests and radiocaesium analyses of the plants. The TFs showed no significant ageing effect, but a pronounced seasonal decrease with effective half-lives of about 140 and 160 days for the umbric andosol without and with K-fertilisation, respectively, and of 50 and 60 days for the dystric fluvisol without and with K-fertilisation, respectively. The effect of K-fertilisation on the absolute values of the TF was determined by the ratio between the median TF values obtained for corresponding dates without and with use of K-fertiliser. A ratio of TFwithout K/TFwith (K) = 1.8 for the umbric andosol and TFwithout K/TFwith (K) = 2.9 for the dystric fluvisol was obtained, indicating a reduction of the TF by applying 90 kg K ha(-1). The maximal values of the TF to chard predicted by the equation characterising the seasonal decrease of the TF at the beginning of the harvest periods are 0.19 for the umbric andosol and 0.11 for the dystric fluvisol, both values for soil treated with common K-fertilisation.

Only Catostomus spp., Ictiobus spp., Moxostoma spp., Stizostedion spp., Osmerus mordax, and Perca flavescens were collected during the course of the study. Larval fish species diversity and abundance were lower than expected given the number of adult fish species found in the tailwaters and numbers of larval fishes collected in other studies on the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. The low abundance and diversity likely were due to the hypolimnetic discharge of cold water from Lake Sakakawea. Larval fish species also appeared later in the season than expected.

See vol. 59, pg. 7, 2023)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Unlike most saline lakes, the Chinese ones were formed in depressions entirely by runoff from the surrounding topography, hence greatly affected by seasons and variation in salinity, with microbial composition and functions being the most influenced. Determining the nature of key environmental drivers such as microbial dynamics is necessary. Therefore, the current study applied metagenomics study approach to determining the microbial community diversity and functions across sediment regimen (clay [NT], sandstone [FS] and salt-bearing [SY]) of the East Taijinar Salt Lake, China. The result indicated that members of Actinobacterium did not exhibit variability across the sediment types while members of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria showed some variabilities, and had highest dominance in clay (NT) and sandstone (FS) sediment type as compared to the salt-bearing (SY) sediment type. Based on UniFrac, STAMP analyses there was significant differences (P < 0.05), with the weighted-UniFrac approach indicating the highest abundance under the clay sediment type. According to NMDS analysis, there was closer similarity in microbial composition between the clays sediment type (NT) and sandstone (FS). Furthermore, through the cladogram, it was visualized that there was very low representation of bacterial species from the salt-bearing (SY) sediment type as compared to other sediment types. More COG and KEGG pathways were dominant under the clays (NT) sandstone (FS) sediment types as opposed to the salt-based (SY) sediment type. Based on this result, in-depth studies on spatial and temporal variability in microbial community diversity and eco-genomics functions across the sediments of the East Taijinar Salt Lake is recommended.

J	SMOL, JP				SMOL, JP			THE RATIO OF DIATOM FRUSTULES TO CHRYSOPHYCEAN STATOSPORES - A USEFUL PALEOLIMNOLOGICAL INDEX	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Stratigraphic analyses of the postglacial sediments of Little Round Lake and the recent sediments of 2 additional southern Ontario [Canada] lakes were used to compare the relative abundance of fossil diatom frustules to chrysophycean statospores. Relatively few statospores were recorded during eutrophic phases in the lakes'' histories such as during period of anthrogenic activity in the lakes'' catchment, when diatom frustules were abundant. The increased relative abundance of statospores during the early postglacial in Little Round Lake was attributed to both oligotrophy and a short growing season, conditions that currently exist in many high arctic lakes. From these data it is seen that the ratio of fossil diatom frustules to chrysophycean statospores may provide a useful paleolimnological index of trophic status in temperate lakes. The advantages of this index include its simplicity, the fact that frustules and statospores can be enumerated from the same microscope slides, and that the ratio is independent of sedimentation rates.					; Smol, John/A-8838-2015	Smol, John/0000-0002-2499-6696; 													0018-8158	1573-5117					1985	123	3					199	208		10.1007/BF00034378	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00034378													WOS:A1985AHQ0200002

Species Composition of Fish Eggs and Larvae near Southeast Sakhalin in Dynamic Coastal Conditions	JOURNAL OF ICHTHYOLOGY												Specific features of the habitat and seasonal changes in the species composition and abundance of ichthyoplankton have been studied at four sites off the coast of South-Eastern Sakhalin. The minimum values of water temperature have been recorded in May (from 2.2 degrees C near Lake Ptich'e up to 5.5 degrees C (on average) in the northern part of the water area). The highest heating of the coastal zone (up to 13-17 degrees C on average) occurs in August-October. Water salinity is minimal in the area of entrance of the Dudinka and Dolinka rivers (on average similar to 30 parts per thousand), and maximum, in the area of Lake Ptich'e (31.7 parts per thousand). The ichthyoplankton includes eggs and larvae of 37 fish species from 14 families. Representatives of righteye flounders (Pleuronectidae) predominate in all areas, their proportion increases from south to north from 38 to 71%. High abundance of pelagic fish eggs (24.3-31.1 ind./m(3) on average during the field season) has been recorded only to the north from 47 degrees 30' N; to the south it did not exceed 1.5-6.3 ind./m(3). In the northern areas, the maximum abundance of fish eggs and larvae was formed in May-June, in the southern area, in August. The relationship between the number of fish eggs and environmental conditions has not been evaluated or was weakly expressed. Based on the results of factor analysis, species similar in terms of breeding time and spawning areas have been grouped in pairs: walleye pollock Gadus chalcogrammus and Bering flounder Hippoglossoides robustus, yellowfin sole Limanda aspera and speckled flounder Myzopsetta punctatissima, starry flounder Platichthys stellatus and yellow striped flounder Pseudopleuronectes herzensteini.						, ilias/0009-0003-6147-2052													0032-9452	1555-6425				AUG	2022	62	4					605	622		10.1134/S0032945222040154	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0032945222040154													WOS:000853064700009

Surface water samples were subjected to chemical analyses using absorption spectrophotometry (Ptot and P-PO43-) and accompanying parameters (t, O-2, pH, Cond, TSS ) were measured. Next, grain size analysis of the sediment and sediment analyses using X-ray fluorescence were carried out (P, Fe, Al, Ca, Si, K, Mn, S, etc.). The seasonality of Ptot concentrations in the water was not confirmed, the reservoir behaved as a pool. The concentrations of the dissolved inorganic form P-PO43- were low when compared to Ptot, thus suspended phosphorus prevailed. This may be related to the low depth of the given water body, where stratification does not occur in contrast to deep water bodies. However, sediment resuspension is frequent, and phosphorus largely accumulates. The concentrations of Ptot in the sediment ranged around 4900 mg/kg, where the inorganic form prevailed (87.24 - 93.73 %) over the organic (6.27 - 12.76 %). At the same time, the sediment samples were abundant for sand fractions (2 - 0.03 mm), 47.86 - 60.89 %, and finest silt and clay (< 0.063 mm), 33.07 - 44.60 %.

Two important sampling sites (reference site S1; impacted site S2) characterized by various human activities were identified along the river. Anthropogenic activities were common at the impacted site (S2). High concentrations of TDS, phosphates, nitrates, sodium, turbidity, and conductivity were recorded at site S2. Based on Pearson's correlation coefficient and canonical correspondence analysis, a few parameters including the dissolved oxygen, water velocity, TDS, turbidity, pH and nitrates shape the taxonomic order and species of macroinvertebrate in the Baldi River. The dominance of species under Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera orders at site S1 indicated the stress-free conditions, whereas an increase in the density of Oli-gochaeta and Diptera (Chrimonoids) at site S2 represented serious anthropogenic stress condition. Lower values of biotic indices (Shannon-Weiner diversity index, EPT %, BMWP, and ASPT) also indicated a disturbance at site S2. Degradation in water quality, decrease in the dominance of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera, and an increase in Annelids and Chrimonoids are the key factors that reflect anthropogenic stress on the Baldi River.

J	CROLEY, TE				CROLEY, TE			LONG-TERM HEAT-STORAGE IN THE GREAT-LAKES	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Practical estimation of long-term daily Great Lakes evaporation requires one-dimensional (depth) models of heat storage and mixing. Conceptual models are preferable to physical models for small-computer simulations that are multiple, continuous, and long. This paper describes a new conceptual superposition model of heat storage to extend an existing evaporation model along the lake depth. The resulting daily model is recalibrated to remotely sensed surface water temperatures and is used to illustrate anew seasonal heating and cooling cycles, heat-temperature hysteresis, water column turnovers, and mixed-layer developments. It is used as well to compare the vertical distribution of temperatures with independent bathythermograph data. The time occurrence structure of evaporation on the Great Lakes is investigated, and the effects of summertime initial conditions on subsequent wintertime behavior of evaporation are simulated. Impacts of perceived large-lake thermodynamic behavior are analyzed, and suggestions are made for further research.																			0043-1397					JAN	1992	28	1					69	81		10.1029/91WR02500	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/91WR02500													WOS:A1992GY77200007

Ephemeropteran nymphs were the major prey of redbreast sunfish (Lepomis auritus; 70.5%) and smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu 59.7%) during each of six 4-h intervals over a 24-h period. The main dietary component of mimic shiner (Notropis volucellus) was chironomids (42.3%), whereas spotfin shiner (Cyprinella spiloptera) mainly ate terrestrial invertebrates (50.2%), Juvenile white sucker (Catostomus commersoni) exhibited substantial diel variation in diet composition with some prey taxa composing the entire diet during some 4-h intervals and being completely absent from the diet during other periods. Bluntnose minnow (Pimephales notatus) contained mostly detritus (75.5%). Interspecific diel diet overlap (C lambda) was low among the six species except for smallmouth bass-redbreast sunfish (0.735). Mimic shiner ((x) over bar = 0.307) had the highest diet overlap with other species and bluntnose minnow ((x) over bar = 0.134) had the least similar, Smallmouth bass, redbreast sunfish, white sucker, and spotfin shiner all had diurnal feeding peaks, Peak food consumption of mimic shiner and bluntnose minnow occurred at midnight. Our results indicate that because of diel variation in diet composition and feeding periodicity for these six species, dietary analysis conducted at only one interval would not provide an accurate representation of the diet of these species.																			0270-5060					MAR	1995	10	1					11	18		10.1080/02705060.1995.9663412	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1995.9663412													WOS:A1995QM53800002

It includes an egestion function allowing any proportional mix of fish and invertebrates in the diet, a growth model accounting for both ontogenetic and seasonal changes in energy-density of predator and prey, model for typical in situ swimming speed and reproductive energy losses due to gametes shed. Gross conversion efficiency of energy by lake trout over their life (21.8%) is about twice the efficiency of converting biomass to growth because they store large amounts of high-energy fats. Highest conversion efficiencies are obtained by relative fast-growing individuals, and over half the annual energy assimilated by older age-classes may be shed as gametes. Sensitivity analysis indicates a general robustness of the model, especially for estimating consumption by fitting a known growth curve. Large sensitivities were for the intercept and weight dependence coefficients of metabolism. Population biomass and associated predatory impact of a given cohort increase steadily for about 3.5 yr then decline steadily after fishing mortality becomes important in the 4th year in the lake. This slow response time precludes manipulation of lake trout stocking densities as a means to control short-term prey fluctuations. Predation by lake trout on alewife, Alosa pseudoharengus, has been increasing steadily since 1965 to .apprx. 8400 tons .cntdot. yr-1, and is projected to rise to almost 12,000 tons .cntdot. yr-1 by 1990.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1983	40	6					681	698		10.1139/f83-091	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f83-091													WOS:A1983QS61300002
S	Bhutiyani, MR		Kale, VS		Bhutiyani, Mahendra R.			The Siachen Glacier: The Second Longest Glacier Outside the Polar Regions	LANDSCAPES AND LANDFORMS OF INDIA	World Geomorphological Landscapes											The Nubra Valley in Karakoram Himalaya is a highly glacierized valley with about 33 valley glaciers of different lengths and sizes. The glaciers occupy nearly 213th of the total basin area. The most prominent and longest amongst them is the Siachen Glacier. This well-known glacier is a fine example of a compound and piedmont glacier. Glacier erosion has resulted in the development of a myriad of erosional and depositional features. These include numerous tributary glaciers with cirques, aretes, horns, bergschrunds, moraines, supra-glacial streams and glacier lakes. Being a temperate glacier, the Siachen produces copious amount of runoff during ablation season in its proglacial streams. Heavy sediment load carried by the Nubra River has given rise to many glacio-fluvial depositional landforms and features such as outwash plains, braided rivers, alluvial fans, varved clays, etc. Evidence indicates three periods of glaciation in the area during the last 145 ka. The role of tectonics in the late Quaternary period is also evident by way of at least three episodes of uplift, resulting in the formation of river terraces. There is no indication of significant recession of the Siachen Glacier snout during the last millennium.																			2213-2090		978-94-017-8029-2; 978-94-017-8028-5				2014							105	113		10.1007/978-94-017-8029-2_9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-8029-2_9	10.1007/978-94-017-8029-2												WOS:000357823400011

Plankton composition and environmental parameters in the habitat of the Iranian cave barb (Iranocypris typhlops) in Iran	ANIMAL BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												The Iranian cave barb (Iranocypris typhlops Bruun & Kaiser, 1944) is 'Vulnerable' in the IUCN Red List. It is an endemic species of ray finned fish of the family Cyprinidae from a single locality in the Zagros Mountains, western Iran. This species is an omnivore that depends on plankton for food. We studied the spatial and seasonal distribution of plankton in the native habitat of the Iranian cave barb between May 2012 and February 2013. We measured various environmental parameters and related these to plankton distribution. The plankton assemblage included 13 genera and five species. Rotifera had the highest number of genera (4) and species (4), followed by Arthropoda (3), Ochrophyta (3), Myzozoa (2), Charophyta (2), Chlorophyta (2), Ciliophora (1) and Cryptophyta (1). In terms of numbers, the dominant species of phytoplankton and zooplankton were Achnanthidium sp. and Lecane sp. Pearson correlation coefficients showed a low but significant relationship between plankton communities and environmental parameters. Among the environmental parameters, total suspended solids and turbidity seemed to have the most important influence on the temporal distribution of plankton species. We also observed that dissolved oxygen played an important role for most plankton species, as did temperature for most zooplankton species. The diversity and abundance of phytoplankton and zooplankton were low throughout the year in the cave with an annual mean of 96.4 ind./l and they did not show any peaks during the year.					; Farashi, Azita/AAE-6892-2021; Naghavi, Mohammad/L-8722-2017	Rezaei, HamidReza/0000-0002-9422-5600; Farashi, Azita/0000-0002-5536-2311; Naghavi, Mohammad Reza/0000-0002-2427-3332; Rahimian, Hassan/0000-0002-9276-9524; 													1578-665X	2014-928X					2014	37	1					13	21																WOS:000341223500002

Changes in stratification, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), and O-2 concentration in the epilimnion and hypolimnion of the lake (internal factors), in addition to external sources such as input of nitrate and organic N via the Jordan River and atmospheric deposition, all have an impact on microbial diversity and activity. Assimilation, nitrification, denitrification, ammonification, and N-2 fixation are the main processes mediated by microbial populations in Lake Kinneret.

Deposits from the following four locations were studied; from West to East, at the Peremitschka plain, which is seasonally flooded by melt waters and then turns into the Lower Lake Merzbacher, which is dammed by the Southern Inylchek Glacier; at the stable moraine-pond-ensemble, and at the glacier front of the Northern Inylchek Glacier. The development of the Southern-and Northern Inylchek Glacier is quite complex due to the fact that the Northern Inylchek Glacier retreated and advanced at least twice during the Holocene, and hence two fluctuation cycles can be described. The youngest fluctuation cycle has been documented for the last century using remote sensing imageries. In the 1950s a proglacial lake developed which expanded by four kilometres by the 1990s and was then termed Upper Lake Merzbacher. In 1996 the Northern Inylchek Glacier rapidly advanced again, shortening the Upper Lake Merzbacher by 75%. For analysing the older cycle, which occurred prior to 1900, fine-grained, bedded deposits in the Peremitschka, in the stable moraine-pond-ensemble, and at the front of the Northern Inylchek Glacier, consisting of clayey silt, sandy silt and sandy clay, were investigated. The clay mineralogy of these fine-grained deposits reflects the mineralogical composition of the surrounding Paleozoic bedrock, with the bulk spectrum primarily consisting of potassium feldspar, plagioclase, chlorite, quartz, muscovite, biotite and calcite. The fine-grained clay- and silt-deposits of the stable moraine-pond-ensemble plot in the field of pelagic suspension in Passegas CM grain size diagram. Soft-sediment deformation of the laminated lake sediments on top of the stable moraine-pond-ensemble comprises microstructures such as asymmetrical and disharmonic folds. The glacio-lacustrine deposits on top of the stable moraine-pond-ensemble are overlain by ground moraine material indicating a glacier advance at the end of the older fluctuation cycle, during which the Northern Inylchek Glacier probably piled up multiple moraine walls east of the Peremitschka plain. Lining up fine-grained glacio-lacustrine deposits covering the Peremitschka, the stable moraine-pond-ensemble, and the surged Northern Inylchek Glacier, one can delineate a paleolake of approximately 10 kilometres in length, which results in a paleo water level at 3500 m altitude. This lake is termed "Paleolake Merzbacher", which is inferred to have been dammed by both the Southern and Northern Inylchek Glaciers. Late-glacial to Neoglacial moraines at Poljana, at an altitude of 3530 m above sea level, indicate that the Southern Inylchek Glacier was able to dam Paleolake Merzbacher.

Alterations in the photomineralization of allochthonous DOM related to elevated atmospheric CO2	INLAND WATERS												Climate-related shifts in forest composition and chemistry will likely affect the quantity and quality of dissolved organic matter (DOM) entering inland waters, and consequently, carbon dioxide (CO2) evasion. We examined the photodegradation of DOM derived from 2 common riparian plant species (Populus tremuloides and Salix alba) grown at ambient (360 ppm) and elevated (720 ppm) atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Rates and total photolytic CO2 production were determined for sterilized leachates ranging from 5 to 100 mg L-1 dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Based on multiple regression analysis, DOC concentration, followed by plant species, best predicted the rate and total flux of CO2. Photolytic CO2 production increased linearly with DOC concentration; however, the 5 mg L-1 treatment had the greatest rate per unit carbon, suggesting a self-shading effect of increasing DOC. The atmospheric CO2 conditions under which the plants were grown had no statistically significant effect, despite observed differences in CO2 fluxes between ambient and elevated Populus leachates. Fluorescence data suggest differences in photolytic CO2 production among treatments are related to differences in plant chemistry within the humic fraction. Thus, the magnitude of the photolytic CO2 flux from fresh waters in the future will depend primarily on climate-related changes in the quantity of terrestrial DOM inputs and secondarily by DOM source.

J	Vargas-Fonseca, EM				Maria Vargas-Fonseca, Elena			Relation between diversity of waterfowl and temporal variation of the dimensions of a palustrine wetland in Puntarenas, Costa Rica	ORNITOLOGIA NEOTROPICAL												Laguna Pochotal is a palustrine wetland, uncommon in the Pacific coast of Costa Rica. However, information about it is scarce, scattered, and overall lacking. The aim of this study was to record the waterfowl community of the Laguna Pochotal and the dimensions of the wetland throughout an annual cycle in order to understand the relation between biotic and abiotic factors, and ultimately to provide reliable knowledge that enables the local government to manage and conserve this wetland. The study was conducted between May 2009 and April 2010, when 19 species belonging to 11 families were recorded. The estimators Chao 2 and Jack 1 state that the proportion of registered species was 98%. The average relative abundance of the waterfowl community in the period of study was 32.66 individuals. According to the monthly richness and using the Jaccard index, the community composition of aquatic birds was divided into four periods: 1) May, June, and July; 2) August, September, and November; 3) October, December, and January; 4) February, March, and April. During the rainy season (May October), species richness was significantly correlated with depth, area, and perimeter while the abundance was not correlated to any of the physical variables. During the dry season (November to April), both the abundance and richness were significantly correlated to the variables depth, area and perimeter. The data indicate that the waterfowl community is responding to other factors than the physical variables analyzed in this study, and the context suggests that prey availability could be an important factor, to be analyzed in future studies. It is important that the natural seasonal fluctuations of the physical variables of the wetland are not aggravated by drainages or human impacts that could cause its desiccation during the dry season and negatively affect the trophic cascades that occur in this ecosystem.																			1075-4377						2014	25	3					333	343																WOS:000348618700007

Fluctuation of gonadosomatic index during oocyte development in the narrow-clawed crayfish Astacus leptodactylus (Eschscholtz, 1823) in Aras Dam Lake, Iran	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES SCIENCES												This study was carried out with the aim of examining the seasonal reproductive cycle of the female crayfish Astacus leptodactylus from Aras Dam Lake, Western-Azerbaijan, Iran. Gonadosomatic index (GSI), and oocyte size were measured in females sampled seasonally in June, August, November(2011), January(2012). Development of the oocytes was categorized according to the diameter and the presence/absence of yolk granules. The ovary development was accompanied by increasing levels gonadosomatic index and egg diameter. Ovarian development histologicaly related to the seasonal GSI. This index was low in June (0.61 +/- 0.05) when oocytes started developing and reached the highest value in November (13.53 +/- 0.25), when vitellogenic oocytes were abundant in the mature ovary. Our results highlight the relationship between the ovary development and the GSI and egg diameter in the crayfish A. leptodactylus during the reproductive cycle and held important implications for the management of aquatic species. Thus, investigation of female A. leptodactylus reproduction is highly significant for fisheries managers as well as environmentalists concerned with perpetuating crayfish stocks.					; Paolucci, Marina/AFN-6173-2022; safi, shahahbeddin/ABC-7686-2021	Matinfar, Abbas/0000-0001-8150-0645; Paolucci, Marina/0000-0002-1784-3843; 													1562-2916					JAN	2014	13	1					103	111																WOS:000339657400009

A project supported by the Cariplo Foundation, called "Ecological and hydromorphological requalification of wetlands in the Ticino area around Pavia" (South-East Lombardy, Northern Italy), was started in 2010 with the aim of improving the chemical, bio-ecological and hydrological conditions of these wetlands. In line with the aim of this project, we selected two wetlands near the main course of the Ticino River for investigation, one of which is impacted by a combined sewer overflow from the sewerage networks which is always active (San Lanfranco (SL) wetland), whereas the other (Topo (TO) oxbow lake) is less directly impacted by anthropogenic activities. In this paper, we report the ecological situation of these two wetlands before the requalification process by investigating the way the zooplankton assemblages, considered as bio-indicators, respond to anthropogenic pressure. Overall, we collected 19 taxa: 4 cladocerans, 1 copepod and 14 rotifers. In the TO oxbow lake, we found a stable community, dominated by the cladoceran Bosmina longirostris. By comparison, in the SL wetland we found a pioneer community, dominated by the juvenile stage of the copepod Thermocyclops dybowskii. The SL wetland was shown to be most urgently in need of improvement and is therefore first in line for requalification, whereas the TO oxbow lake needs less drastic measures to ensure the long-term ecological functioning of the aquatic environment. After these requalification activities, a systematic zooplankton survey will be carried out to monitor the evolution of the riverine wetlands.

Water Relations in Sierra Nevada Mixed Conifer: Wildfire Effects and Species Distinctions	JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY												An investigation of wildfire effects on water relations of Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi Grev. & Balf.) along with species comparisons of the water relations of unburned specimens of this pine to those of unburned white fir (Abies concolor var. lowiana [Gord.] Lemm.) were conducted in a mixed conifer stand located in the Lake Tahoe Basin. Xylem water potentials were significantly lower in burned than in the unburned Jeffrey pine as measured in predawn, midday, and evening periods distributed over more than two postfire growing seasons, while soil water potentials were lower in burned than in unburned stand portions during the drier parts of the growing season, but the reverse proved true during the wetter part. Diurnal fluctuation in bole diameter, a measure of stored water recharge capacity, was largely unaffected by wildfire, however. Xylem water potentials were consistently lower in unburned white fir than in unburned Jeffrey pine and DBH fluctuation was often lower in the fir than in the pine as well, but soil water potentials associated with unburned subject trees did not differ significantly between the two species. Demonstrated here are ecophysiological alterations that occur in Sierra Nevada mixed conifer due to wildfire and shifting species composition.																			1054-9811	1540-756X					2014	33	3					211	247		10.1080/10549811.2013.836977	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10549811.2013.836977													WOS:000209679200001
J	Crane, PE; Hiratsuka, Y				Crane, PE; Hiratsuka, Y			Evidence for environmental determination of uredinia and telia production in Chrysomyxa pirolata (inland spruce cone rust)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												Chrysomyxa pirolata Wint., the cause of inland spruce cone rust, is a serious pathogen in natural spruce forests and seed orchards. Cone infection is caused by basidiospores produced by telia on alternate hosts in the genera Pyrola, Moneses, and Orthilia. The disease cycle of this rust and the influence of moisture on the differentiation of telia on Pyrola asarifolia Michx. were studied over two growing seasons at a wet site adjacent to a spruce seed orchard and a drier site adjacent to another orchard at Smoky Lake, Alberta, and at Edmonton and Hinton, Alberta. The proportion of uredinia to telia varied with microsite conditions, with more frequent production of telia in moist sites. The effect of moisture on formation of telia was tested by subjecting infected plants with immature sori to 90-100%, relative humidity under various temperature and light conditions. Plants under high humidity, regardless of other conditions, formed mainly telia from immature sori, even if uredinia had already formed on parts of the leaves before the experiments. Telia formation, however, was much slower at 4-6 degrees C than at 22 degrees C. Cross-sections of sori showed that young uredinia could sometimes convert to telia. Results of a field experiment also suggested that increasing moisture increases the percentage of telia produced on plants. The production of undifferentiated sori that can become either uredinia or telia in response to environmental conditions may allow the fungus to maximize vegetative proliferation when conditions are unfavorable for sexual reproduction. It might also explain the large variation in cone rust levels from year to year in a given location.																			0008-4026					MAY	2000	78	5					660	667		10.1139/b00-041	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b00-041													WOS:000088167300011
J	PRICE, CJ; TONN, WM; PASZKOWSKI, CA				PRICE, CJ; TONN, WM; PASZKOWSKI, CA			INTRASPECIFIC PATTERNS OF RESOURCE USE BY FATHEAD MINNOWS IN A SMALL BOREAL LAKE	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												An isolated, single-species assemblage of fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) was studied to identify patterns of feeding and diel activity among three life-history groups (adult males, adult females, and juveniles). Minnows were collected from inshore and offshore stations during monthly (May-August) 24-h sampling periods. Minnows appeared flexible in their choide of food items, concentrating their feeding on invertebrate taxa, such as emerging chironomid pupae, that were temporarily available, as well as on relatively large and vulnerable microcrustaceans, such as Daphnia. Adult males, larger than females and juveniles, consumed the amphipod Hyallela azteca to a greater extent than the two smaller-bodied groups. Patterns of habitat use and activity were also consistent with behavioral flexibility. Prior to the breeding season, when all three groups were abundant, the population displayed intraspecific differences in diel activity; adults were typically active at night, when chironomid pupae were most abundant, whereas juveniles were primarily day active. Later, as catches of males declined, spatial and temporal patterns of females and juveniles were similar and diet overlap was high. Characteristics of both the fish population and their prey interact to shape patterns of resource use in fathead minnows.

Determination of trace element and fatty acid levels in tissues of mirror and scaly carp (Cyprinus carpio L., 1758) living in Keban Dam Reservoir (Elazig)	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												This study investigated the concentrations of some accumulated trace metals (iron, manganese, zinc and copper) and fatty acids in liver and muscle tissues of mirror and scaly carp varieties (Cyprinus carpio L., 1758) living in Keban Dam Reservoir (Elazig), which is the second-largest artificial lake in Turkey that hosts commercially valuable and preferred fish varieties for human consumption. The inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) method was used to analyse the concentrations of trace elements. Fatty acid levels were measured in a gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) device, using a flame ionization detector (FID). Considering the two fish varieties and tissues that were studied, the mean metal concentrations (mu g g(-1)) were found in the following ranges: Fe 12.32-49.97, Mn 0.12-0.62, Zn 10.45-86.59 and Cu 2.74-11.86. Although the lowest levels were detected in the muscle tissue for all the metals examined, the levels in the liver tissue were significantly higher. According to the results of the analyses on fatty acid concentrations, the mean total saturated fatty acid levels in the muscle tissue of the scaly carp and mirror carp varieties were found to be 31.07 and 31.43 (%), respectively, whereas these values for the liver tissue were consecutively 22.36 and 22.08 (%). Successively, the mean total levels of unsaturated fatty acids were determined as 68.93 and 68.40 (%) in the muscle tissue and 77.64 and 77.92 in the liver tissue. This study, with the finding that the trace (metallic) element accumulation rates were below the upper limits of the tolerable range, and the examined fish varieties were rich in fatty acids, shows that mirror carp and scaly carp living in Keban Dam Reservoir are highly nutritious for human diets.					bengu, aydin/GPP-4213-2022; Ekin, Suat/AAR-2193-2020; HARLIOGLU, AYSE/V-8812-2018; Aydin, Suleyman/GLQ-8843-2022	Ekin, Suat/0000-0002-6502-5028; bengu, aydin sukru/0000-0002-7635-4855; Aydin, Sevinc/0000-0001-8597-8064; 														1095-8649				OCT	2022	101	4					811	821		10.1111/jfb.15135	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfb.15135		JUL 2022						35722730					WOS:000828943600001
J	Bennett, SW; Olyphant, GA				Bennett, SW; Olyphant, GA			Temporal and spatial variability in rates of eolian transport determined from automated sand traps: Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, USA	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Automated Sand Traps (ASTs) were deployed in four subenvironments of the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore (IDNL) and were monitored, along with near surface wind speed and direction, on a semi-continuous basis for two field seasons. An analysis of several individual wind storms indicated that sand transport rates af; the field site are strongly affected by transient factors such as antecedent soil moisture, rainfall, snowcover, and ground freezing. Plots of measured (AST) sand-transport rates versus wind speed (at 1.5 m) consistently exhibited a histeresis loop wherein the same wind speeds were associated with different transport rates at the beginning and end of wind storms. The simultaneous measurements of sand transport by identical ASTs indicated that rates consistently differ by one-to two orders of magnitude in the primary subenvironments of the backshore-foredune area at IDNL. The data collected in this study testify to a large degree of variability in sand transport rates that is not adequately accounted for in conventional eolian transport models which assume that an equilibrium condition exists between wind flow and sand transport.																			0749-0208					WIN	1998	14	1					283	290																WOS:000071622500022

Extensive pumping of water from the Lake Dipsiz during irrigation seasons creates landslide developments at the shores of the lake. Five stages of landslide development were observed in the unconsolidated soils around Lake Dipsiz. Bowl-shaped solution-subsidence features with depths from 1 to 3 m and diameters between 1 and 60 m were formed due to excess pumping, and recharge and discharge features of unconfined aquifer. The pumping activities must be controlled to prevent further environmental problems. Lake Dipsiz and other subsidence developments are the groundwater exposure areas highly vulnerable to contamination. The proposed remedies for overcoming the environmental problems are the establishment of conservation areas around such natural features; ceasing the removal of top soil, controlling the urbanization, and keeping the livestock farming away from the areas susceptible to pollution.

Bacterial and heterotrophic protistan (flagellate and ciliate) abundance was determined by epifluorescence direct counts; protistan grazing on planktonic bacteria was measured from fluorescently labeled bacteria uptake rates; and the estimate of bacterial secondary production was obtained from [H-3]thymidine incorporation rates. The abundance of bacterial, flagellate, and ciliate communities was similar during cold and warm situations. However, we observed that estimates of dynamic parameters, i.e., secondary bacterial production and protistan grazing, in both situations were noticeably different. In the warm situation, grazing rates of flagellates and ciliates (bacteria per protist per hour) were, respectively, 7 times and 18 times higher than those determined in the cold situation, and the grazing rates of the protistan communities (bacteria per protists present in 1 ml of water per hour) increased up to 5 times in the case of flagellates and 42 times in the case of ciliates. Estimates of bacterial secondary production were also higher during the warm situation, showing a ninefold increase. The percentage of bacterial production preyed upon by flagellates or ciliates was not significantly different between the two conditions. These results showed that in the different conditions of a system, the flux of biomass between the trophic levels may be quite different although this process may not be reflected in the abundance of each community of bacteria, flagellates, and ciliates.

Assessing variation in below-ground organic matter dynamics in the Ramsar-declared Nylsvley Wetland system, South Africa	CHEMISTRY AND ECOLOGY												Wetlands physical and biological processes are fundamental to the distribution and structuring of organic matter in sediments. This study investigated spatial and temporal changes in organic matter sources in sediments within the Nylsvley Wetland, South Africa across two seasons, five sites and three wetland zones and identified pertinent contributors to sediment organic matter. Results showed distributions were uneven throughout the wetlands, with the seasonal zone having slightly high sediment organic matter in the cool-dry season and the permanent zone had high sediment organic matter in the hot-wet season, whereas the temporary zone had low SOM concentrations. Significant differences in nutrient concentrations were observed across wetland zones and seasons for Phosphorous, Potassium, Calcium and Magnesium, with the seasonal zone tending to be the most nutrient-rich in the cool-dry season, and with permanent zone nutrient levels rising substantially in the hot-wet season. Sediment delta C-13 differed significantly among wetland zones, whereas delta N-15 was statistically similar. Autochthonous plants were the main sources of organic matter in sediments overall across sites and zones. This study's findings help to better understand the distribution of organic matter in wetland ecosystems and the role wetland zones play in the seasonal provisioning of allochthonous inputs.					; Dalu, Tatenda/K-3089-2012; Wasserman, Ryan/D-5492-2012; Dondofema, Farai/AGR-5511-2022	Wasserman, Ryan J/0000-0002-4162-1503; Cuthbert, Ross N./0000-0003-2770-254X; Dalu, Tatenda/0000-0002-9019-7702; DONDOFEMA, FARAI/0000-0001-8685-125X; 													0275-7540	1029-0370				AUG 9	2022	38	7					617	635		10.1080/02757540.2022.2100361	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02757540.2022.2100361		JUL 2022											WOS:000825460500001
J	Pawlikowski, K; Kornijów, R				Pawlikowski, Krzysztof; Kornijow, Ryszard			Distribution of benthic macroinvertebrates across a reed stand in a brackish Baltic lagoon	OCEANOLOGIA												The role of reeds in the functioning of ecosystems and their significance for zoobenthos in the coastal lagoons is poorly understood. We hypothesise that next to the spatial zonal differentiation of abiotic factors in the apparently homogeneous habitat of reeds, benthic macroinvertebrate fauna is also unevenly distributed, and differs in taxonomic and functional diversity, as well as density and biomass across the reed stand. The research was carried out in the Vistula Lagoon (southern Baltic) along three designated sectors arranged parallel to the shoreline and differing in distance from the shore and depth. Mean density of reed stems in the analysed stand was within the range of values reported from different American and European wetlands. Regardless of the location within the reeds and the season, the fauna was dominated by detritivorous Tubificinae and larvae of Chironomidae. The highest diversity, density, and biomass of fauna were found in the middle littoral zone, and the lowest in the outer zone adjacent to the open water. The presented data support our hypothesis predicting the existence of a spatial variation pattern in the composition and distribution of macroinvertebrates in response to the changing zonal habitat conditions within the reed stand. ?? 2022 Institute of Oceanology of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

J	Virro, T				Virro, T			Life cycle patterns of rotifers in Lake Peipsi	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Life cycle strategies of rotifers in Lake Peipsi (Estonia) were examined. Bisexual (mictic) reproduction was detected in 26 species. Life cycle patterns were determined for 17 species. All three basic life cycle patterns were represented, with some evidence of intraspecific variability. The midcycle pattern, with mixis occurring near the population maximum, prevailed. Extended mixis was observed in littoral populations of Polyarthra luminosa and P. remata. Most species probably are monocyclic. Polyarthra dolichoptera and Synchaeta oblonga may be dicyclic. Mictic periods were not detected in Conochilus hippocrepis and C. unicornis, which probably are acyclic in L. Peipsi. Mictic ratios and egg ratios were calculated for some of the dominant species. The highest amictic egg ratios were observed slightly before or at the population maxima. High mictic ratios (1.0) indicated very intense bisexual reproduction in populations of A. fissa, P. dolichoptera and S. verrucosa. Definite periods of bisexual reproduction could not be distinguished in the rotifer community. During May-October, the spread of mictic reproduction merely reflects the general seasonal distribution of rotifers. Their life cycle strategies represent specific adaptations to unpredictability of their habitat. The results of the study confirm that mixis is an anticipatory event, and not a response to environment deterioration, or an ending of a rotifer population cycle.

J	Caruso, BS				Caruso, BS			Integrated assessment of phosphorus in the Lake Hayes catchment, South Island, New Zealand	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												This study illustrates an integrated watershed-based approach for assessment of phosphorus (P) in the Lake Hayes catchment in the South Island of New Zealand. Spatial and temporal variability of total (TP) and dissolved reactive P (DRP) concentrations and loadings were evaluated at key locations including inflow to, within, and outflow from the lake, and in tributaries. Particulate P was the dominant form, and TP was highly correlated with suspended solids. Equivalence tests were used to evaluate differences in TP concentrations among locations and showed differences greater than or equal to 20% between only two streams. Differences between other locations were not as large but some were still significant. Concentrations were highest at the lake inflow (mean = 0.065 and maximum = 0.614 mg 1(-1)), and values at the lake surface were low but increased with depth. The lower half of the catchment had the greatest specific TP loading (25.2 g km(-1) day(-1)) and the overall lending at the lake inflow was 13.2 g km(-1) day(-1). Temporal variability, particularly during a storm, was evaluated in detail at the lake inflow. Seasonality in concentrations for the group of stations was not evident, hut values at Fish Trap increased considerably during the storm (81 540 g day(-1)). Baseflow, snowmelt, and one storm accounted for 47, 30 and 23%, respectively, of the total annual loading. Evaluation of data attributes was performed to assist with interpretation of results and showed that the data were very right-skewed and there was considerable uncertainty. Evaluation of groundwater quality data provided information on potential P sources to and losses from surface water and suggested that P enters groundwater in the upper catchment and is discharged to surface water in the lower reaches. Although concentrations exceeded aquatic ecosystem guidelines in several locations, assessment of aquatic biota suggested that they are not limiting stream benthic communities or causing algal blooms in recent years. The methodology provides a framework that integrates components of other studies of P processes and export, and can be used for NPS pollution assessment, targeting and decision making in agricultural catchments.

J	Wagner, RA; Tisdale, TS; Zhang, J				Wagner, RA; Tisdale, TS; Zhang, J			A framework for phosphorus transport modeling in the Lake Okeechobee watershed	WATER RESOURCES BULLETIN												A modeling framework was developed to determine phosphorus loadings to Lake Okeechobee from watersheds located north of the lake. This framework consists of the land-based model CREAMS-WT, the in-stream transport model QUAL2E, and an interface procedure to format the land-based model output for use by the in-stream model. QUAL2E hydraulics and water quality routines were modified to account for flow routing and phosphorus retention in both wetlands and stream channels. Phosphorus loadings obtained from previous applications of CREAMS-WT were used by QUAL2E, and calibration and verification showed that QUAL2E accurately simulated seasonal and annual phosphorus loadings from a watershed. Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses indicated that the accuracy of monthly loadings can be improved by using better estimates of in-stream phosphorus decay rates, ground water phosphorus concentrations, and runoff phosphorus concentrations as input to QUAL2E.																			0043-1370					FEB	1996	32	1					57	73																WOS:A1996TV95700007

However, high-resolution time-series data related to the histories of climatic changes in these areas are limited. Therefore, this multiproxy analysis of a sediment core from the Baidunzi wetland, northwest China, was conducted using grain size, total organic carbon, glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs), and molecular biomarkers. The results show that GDGTs can reliably reconstruct paleoclimate changes recorded in sediments in salt marsh environments. The climate and environment history of the past 800 years can be divided into the three stages: the end of the dry Medieval Warm Period (MWP) (1278???1366 CE), a humid Little Ice Age (LIA) (1366???1896 CE), and the humid Current Warm Period (CWP) (1896???1999 CE). The Baidunzi setting during the end of the MWP was a warm and dry wetland with high salinity, low water levels, and emersed aquatic plants, and the depositional environment transitioned from fluvial facies to shore lake facies. In contrast, the local climate during the LIA was cold and humid, and the era was characterized by the appearance of vascular flora and two short-term flooding events, that caused a rise in water levels. The lowest temperatures and highest salinities of the period were correlated, which was likely caused by seasonal freeze-thaw cycles. During the CWP, the local climate was warm and humid, with a higher water level than during the LIA, and emersed plants again developed in shallow lagoon facies. Generally, salinity was positively correlated with temperature, except for freezing and thawing salinization resulting from episodes of extremely low temperatures. The warm???dry to cold???humid climate changes of the area were like those of arid Central Asia, which indicates that the Baidunzi region was affected mainly by the Westerlies and was impacted by southward intrusions of that system. The area was also affected by the North Atlantic Oscillation and experienced diminished evaporation during periods of cold climate.																			0009-2541	1872-6836				SEP 30	2022	607								121005	10.1016/j.chemgeo.2022.121005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2022.121005		JUL 2022											WOS:000824677400001

Pinatubo, before and during the rainy season, respectively on 9 July and 13 August 1993. The last one is coeval with typhoon and subsequent lahar activity. From field observations and consideration of physical properties of lahar surfaces, we decipher keys to detect areas covered by recent and active lahars. The main physical characteristics to consider are surface roughness, soil moisture, and morphology. Color compositions show differences between the two dates. Recently deposited lahars may have high or low roughness at the surface and are wet. Running lahars have a tumultuous rough surface. Recently deposited or running lahars have high backscatter values which differ from low values of more ancient flat smooth-surfaced dry lahar sediments or lahars covered by shallow quiet water. Shallow quiet waters covering more ancient rough lahar surfaces are also detected. Anastomotic streams, fanlike patterns, closure or infilling of lakes, and migration of streams are also morphologic expressions of lahar deposits. Flooded areas during typhoons can be recognized from their location in large coastal plains, while lahars occur along main river beds and nearby. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

Although the occurrence of aquatic plants in waterbodies has been widely monitored using remote sensing, the influence of climate variables on macrophyte spatiotemporal dynamics is rarely considered in studies developed for medium scales to long periods of time. We hypothesize that the spatial dispersion of macrophytes has its natural rhythms influenced by climate fluctuations, and, as such, its effects on the heterogeneous spatial distribution of this vegetation should be considered in the monitoring of water bodies. A eutrophic reservoir is selected for study, which uses the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as a proxy for macrophytes. Landsat's NDVI long-term time series are constructed and matched with the Climate Variable (CV) from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to assess the spatiotemporal dynamics of aquatic plants and their associated climate triggers. The NDVI and CV time series and their seasonal and trend components are correlated for the entire reservoir, compartments, and segmented areas of the water body. Granger-causality of these climate variables show that they contribute to describe and predict the spatial dispersion of macrophytes.

C.; Berg, Aaron			Exploring the Relationship between Cover Crop Adoption and Soil Erosion Severity: A Case Study from the Simcoe Watershed, Ontario, Canada	LAND												Runoff from agricultural fields during the nongrowing season is a significant factor leading to phosphorous loading and diminishing water quality in Lake Simcoe, Ontario. Cover crops offer the potential to alleviate phosphorous loss during the nongrowing season by minimizing soil erosional processes and uptaking excess phosphorous; however, recent research suggests that its adoption remains relatively low. More concern lies with the lack of cover crop adoption on areas that are sensitive to soil erosion. This study intends to investigate the likelihood of agricultural productions located on erosive soils to adopt cover crops. Using satellite imagery in corroboration with the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE), this study reveals the frequency of cover crop production and associates soil loss sensitivity at a 30 m resolution from 2013 to 2018. Consistent with recent literature, this study reveals that a small portion (18%) of agricultural operations in the south Simcoe Watershed have incorporated cover crops over the past six years. Cover crops tend to be adopted at a low frequency in areas that have a low sensitivity to soil erosion. This study reveals that areas with higher soil erosion sensitivity are consistent with low-frequency adoption, indicating that these areas are less likely to adopt cover crops regularly. Promoting farm-scale benefits associated with cover crops should target areas in the south Simcoe Watershed that are prone to soil erosion to mitigate total phosphorus (TP) loading into Lake Simcoe.					; Berg, Aaron/AAU-3547-2021	Berg, Aaron/0000-0001-8438-5662; KC, Krishna Bahadur/0000-0003-3966-2928; 														2073-445X				JUL	2022	11	7							988	10.3390/land11070988	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land11070988													WOS:000833761300001

One hundred thirteen recce transects (250 m by 2 m) were undertaken over 34 days of fieldwork. A total of 19 species were detected (3 to genus level only). The encounter rate was 26.65 mammalian signs per km; no differences in numbers of signs between season appeared; however, the dry-season species accumulation pattern was higher than during wet season. Correlation analysis showed increasing density of mammals as distance away from villages, lakes and coast increased. The correlation result is deemed to highlight not only a substantial hunting pressure and avoidance of humans, but also preference for forested habitats noted to appear from 20 km distance from the coast. Using high numbers of relatively short recce transect proved a useful supplementary method for assessing mammalian diversity during rapid biodiversity assessments. Results suggest that 70 recce transects (with a minimum of eight per habitat type) would have been sufficient to yield this information.					; Melville, Haemish/N-5001-2015	Gaugris, Jerome/0000-0002-6606-060X; Burger, Marius/0000-0003-2456-0486; 													0141-6707	1365-2028				DEC	2022	60	4					926	945		10.1111/aje.13047	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aje.13047		JUN 2022											WOS:000818875300001
J	LAST, WM				LAST, WM			GEOLIMNOLOGY OF FREEFIGHT LAKE - AN UNUSUAL HYPERSALINE LAKE IN THE NORTHERN GREAT-PLAINS OF WESTERN CANADA	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Freefight Lake, Canada's deepest salt lake, is a meromictic, hypersaline lake located in the most arid part of the northern Great Plains. The lake has a distinctive basin morphology, with a large expanse of seasonally flooded mud flats and sand flats adjacent to a deep, flat bottomed perennial waterbody. The mixolimnion, dominated by magnesium, sodium and sulphate ions, has an average salinity of 110 ppt and overlies a monimolimnion of 180 ppt total dissolved salts. The entire water column is strongly supersaturated with respect to a variety of calcium and magnesium carbonate minerals; the lower water mass is also saturated or supersaturated with respect to a number of very soluble sodium, magnesium and sodium + magnesium salts. The modem sedimentary processes operating in Freefight Lake give rise to six main sedimentary facies: (i) colluvium, (ii) mud flats and sand flats, (iii) algal flats, (iv) delta, (v) slope and debris apron, and (vi) deep basin. The colluvium, mud flats and sand flats, and delta facies are dominated by physical processes and consist mainly of detrital siliciclastic sediment. The algal flats, slope and debris apron, and deep basin facies are dominated by endogenic and authigenic sediments derived mainly by physicochemical and biologically mediated carbonate and evaporite mineral precipitation. As one of very few deep water lakes in the world in which soluble evaporite minerals are forming and being preserved, Freefight Lake occupies an important position within the realm of lacustrine sedimentology. Although many of the sedimentological and geochemical processes taking place in the basin today are unusual, the delineation and evaluation of these processes is essential in order to decipher properly the stratigraphic records of Quatemary lake sediments in this large area of North America, as well as lacustrine sequences from other arid and semi-arid regions of the world.

Objectives: This project was designed to study the effects of the extent of Urmia lake water surface area on the area size and on the number of aquatic birds of the six selected habitats in 2011-2019. The presence of avian influenza (AI) and Newcastle disease (ND) viruses in migratory aquatic birds together with their impacts on poultry farms as well as on rural birds was also under surveillance in 2018-2019. Methods: Changes of Urmia lake and its impacts on area size of the six selected birds habitats were monitored by GIS. The small monitoring program with circular plot point counts was used for counting of the number of birds of the six selected habitats. At least, 100 samples (oropharyngeal and cloaca! swabs) were collected. each sample was placed in a sterile plastic tube containg transport media and assigned with an number and store untill used. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time RT-PCR test were used for detection of Al and ND viruses in the samples. Results: The results revealed that changes in the water surface area of Urmia lake had a gsignificat impacts on area size and the number of aquatic birds of the six selected habitats. The surveillance results showed that 5% of the samples were AIV positvie while 25% of the samples were pasitive for NDV including 20% for non-virulent NDV (INDV) and 5% for virulent NDV (vNDV) strains. Conclusion: This study showed that fluctuation of Urmia lake's water surface area influenced (p < 0.05) the area size of the six selected aquatic birds' habitats and had a great impacts on the number of the migratory birds. detection of AIV and vNDV emphesises that the seasonal migratory waterfowls spread AI and vND viruses to the ponds and estuaries as well as to the rural birds and industrialised poultry units around the Urmia lake. Potential public health treats were also discussed.

Water-contact rates and the prevalences of urinary schistosomiasis and intestinal schistosomiasis (40.0% of all contacts, 98% and 79%, respectively) were highest among children of 5-12 years, who were also the major contributors to the contamination of the Lake Geriyo environment with faeces and urine. The frequency and duration of water contact followed a seasonal pattern and seemed to be influenced by physiological and social needs such as defecation, urination and avoidance of harsh weather conditions. The interplay between a need for water contact, sanitation, freshwater snails and a supportive environment ensures a recycling of parasites within the studied community. This, in turn, helps to maintain a parasite bank from which infection is probably spread to other areas of the state. The present study is part of a series, on the dynamics of schistosomiasis transmission, which began with a study of the ecology of the freshwater snails in the same area.

Efforts to better understand their ecology uncovered a surprising diversity, vertical structure, and seasonal succession. It is an open question how this diversity has to be considered in models of microbial methane oxidation. Likewise, it is unclear to what extent simple microbial traits related to the kinetics of the oxidation process and temperature optimum, suggested by previous studies, suffice to understand the observed ecology of methane oxidizing bacteria. Here we incorporate niche partitioning in a mechanistic model of seasonal lake mixing and microbial methane oxidation in a stratified lake. Can we model MOB diversity and niche partitioning based on differences in methane oxidation kinetics and temperature adaptation? We found that our model approach can closely reproduce diversity and niche preference patterns of methanotrophs that were observed in seasonally stratified lakes. We show that the combination of trait values resulting in coexisting methanotroph communities is limited to very confined regions within the parameter space of potential trait combinations. However, our model also indicates that the sequence of community assembly, and variations in the stratification and mixing behavior of the lake result in different stable combinations. A scenario analysis introducing variable mixing conditions showed that annual weather conditions and the pre-existing species also affect the developing stable methanotrophic species composition of the lake. Both, effect of pre-existing species and the environmental impact suggest that the MOB community in lakes may differ from year to year, and a stable community may never truly occur. The model further shows that there are always better-adapted species in the trait parameter space that would destabilize and replace an existing stable community. Thus, natural selection may drive trait values into the specific configurations observed in nature based on physiological limits and tradeoffs between traits.

These environments have different origin, type and physic, chemic and climatic variability. This is clear evidence that equatorial environments, like the ones found in Colombia presents variation among them and requires a local approach linked with regional and geographical patterns which influences the limnology of system. The studied environments correspond to high mountain lakes and lowland floodplain, which were monitored in different hydrological seasons and times and the results were reviewed with respect to their environmental and trophic differences. Altitudinal location and therefore the type, origin, morphometry and hydroclimatic conditions which affects the six systems, promotes significant changes in the precipitation regime, temperature, level and water transparency, nutrients concentrations, dissolved oxygen, pH, electrical conductivity and chlorophyll a.

BARNACLE GOOSE (BRANTA LEUCOPSIS) FEEDING ECOLOGY AND TROPHIC RELATIONSHIP ON KOLGUEV ISLAND: THE PATTERNS OF USE OF THE NUTRITIONAL RESOURCES IN TUNDRA AND SEASHORE HABITATS	ZOOLOGICHESKY ZHURNAL												The process of exploitation of new territories by invasive species, as well as their relationship with aboriginal species and the possibility to predict the results of biological invasions is one of the essential problems of ecology. In this respect, an analysis of the modern expansion of barnacle goose (Branta leucopsis) is highly interesting. The main objective of this work is to show barnacle goose breeding in new sites far from the sea in relation to feeding base quality. We analyzed the seasonal dynamics of feeding and the structure of the diet of barnacle goose in the nesting and post-nesting periods (27.05-29.07). We used the coprological cuticular method for the analysis. We chose three areas as model plots, i.e. a slope, a lake depression and a willow-sedge bog tundra. Samples from 10 incubating females in every plot we collected once per 10 days. To determine the diet spectrum, we also gathered additional samples in anthropogenic habitats, the river delta, and in coastline and salt marshes. Simultaneously, we made cuts and plant length measurements. In addition, we compared the diet structure between invasive barnacle goose and the aboriginal species Anser albifrons (white-fronted goose) and A. fabalis (Bean Goose). The similarity of the diets was estimated using cluster analysis (UPGMA), (Multivariate Exploratory Technics of Statistica 10 (2011)). As a measure of pairwise distances, we used the Czekanowski index of niche overlap. Altogether, 185 barnacle goose, 84 white-fronted goose and 3 bean goose samples were analyzed, respectively. We also estimated the possibility of interspecific competition and the ecological advantages of these species. The estimation of diet overlaps between barnacle goose and white-fronted goose was made, based 011 24 groups of feeding plants. We estimated the width and variability of the whole diet spectra and their exclusive parts. For barnacle goose and white-fronted goose, we made an analysis of six intrapopulation groups in 4 phases of the reproduction period. In the tundra, barnacle goose use willow (up to 67%), mosses (up to 41%), Ranunculus pallasii (up to 39%), Cyperaceae, Poaceae, Dycotiledonae (up to 63%) even in the habitats dominated by Carex aquatilis. Barnacle goose feed intensively during the nesting period, not being restricted by the spectrum of feeding plants. There is a tendency to combining the nesting and feeding area. They use habitats without salt marsh vegetation throughout the breeding season. High breeding success indicates that incubating females feed adequately in the tundra. The absence of broods and molting bird's migration to salt marshes shows that the feeding base does not affect the goslings' growth. The overlap of the diets is great, but all feeding resources (except salt marshes) are still unlimited. Competition with the other goose species during the brood rearing period and molting is possible. If the barnacle goose population continues to grow, we expect a decline in the numbers of the aboriginal goose species on Kolguev Island.

In the stomach contents of centropomidae Lates stappersii (one of the four nile perch species in the lake), there were more shrimps both in percentage and frequency in Mpulungu area in the south, than in Kigoma area in the north where the diet of L. stappersii contained bigger proportion of copepods. The results suggest differences in the food chains of the northern and southern pelagic ecosystems of Lake Tanganyika. Food chain differences, probably arise basically from different patterns of mixing, due to seasonal winds and orientation of the lake relative to wind.																			0018-8158					JUL	1999	407						123	129		10.1023/A:1003745716238	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003745716238													WOS:000083710100013

Sampling was done during the late dry season and the water column was very stable. Phytoplankton community was diverse and was dominated by cyanobacterial species which averaged (+/- SD) 97 +/- 1% and 62 +/- 14 % of total phytoplankton abundance and biovolume, respectively. The abundances of these species consistently peaked in the surface layer. Their dominance was related to their positive buoyancy in stable environments, and the resulting shading of surface waters that possibly outcompeted eukaryotic algae. Although most of the extracted chlorophyll was apparently not from the dominant cyanobacterial species, chlorophyll-a concentrations (25.3 to 234 mu g/l), as well as phytoplankton total abundance (2.42 to 11.73 x 10(8) cells/l) and biovolume (18.24 to 135.78 x 10(9) mu m(3)/l), were substantial and characteristic of productive waters. The vertical distribution of the dominant phytoplankton species exhibited three different patterns, according to the depths where their maximum abundances were recorded: (1) surface water populations represented by the cyanobacteria Oscillatoria limosa and Synechocystis pevalekii, (2) mid-layer species, the euglenoid flagellate Lepocinclis fusiformis, and (3) populations that actively avoided the surface water during the nighttime, the euglenoid Trachelomonas hispida and the cryptomonad Cryptomonas ovata. We conclude that these patterns were related to several factors, including light conditions, temperature, cell buoyancy, the potential of motile flagellates to avoid adverse conditions such as grazing pressure, and accorded to the autoecologies of algal species involved.					; Sime-Ngando, Télesphore/M-4134-2019	Sime-Ngando, Telesphore/0000-0002-7240-5803; 													0003-9136					NOV	1998	143	4					469	485																WOS:000077260900004

Additionally, during the wet period, communities from different substrates were analysed to evaluate species habitat preference. A total of 48 diatom taxa are reported. Ordination analysis of species from the dried period revealed different assemblages along the shore-centre gradient. The relative abundance of Staurosira pinnata was higher at the centre of the basin, and at the shore, Nitzschia perminuta and Gomphonema spp. dominated the community. Larger species, such as Pinnularia viridis, P. gibba var. gibba and P. acrosphaeria, were more abundant in the site between centre and shore. Low species affinity to any type of habitat (epipelon, epiphyton and phytoplankton) was found. Strictly phytoplanktonic diatom species were not observed. The analysis of species distribution according to species cell-size indicated differences between small and large species in their responses to environmental variables, such as soil water content and organic matter.																			0029-5035					NOV	2006	83	3-4					459	472		10.1127/0029-5035/2006/0083-0459	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/0029-5035/2006/0083-0459													WOS:000242664300008
J	Waiser, MJ				Waiser, MJ			Nutrient limitation of pelagic bacteria and phytoplankton in four prairie wetlands	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The prairie pothole region of Saskatchewan is characterized by many shallow, highly productive wetlands which support a diverse floral and faunal assemblage. Although assumed to be detritally driven, recent research has revealed that algal communities, both pelagic and attached, may be of great importance in these systems. Bacteria may also be significant. Consequently, studies of factors, for example nutrients, which control microbial growth are needed but lacking. In this study, a suite of physiological tests, including nutrient enrichment bioassays, sestonic ratios, protein to carbohydrate ratios, alkaline phosphatase activity and P-32 (phosphorus) uptake and turnover times, were utilized at four prairie wetland sites to assess nutrient status of algal and bacterial communities. The results indicated that the communities were nutrient sufficient in all ponds for the majority of the ice free season. Sestonic and protein to carbohydrate ratios were within the nutrient sufficient range, alkaline phosphatase activity was low and P-32 uptake and turnover times were slow for the majority of the year. Only in October did P-32 uptake and turnover times indicate P-deficiency. The abundance of biologically available nutrients may be linked to pond hydrology and ability of sediments to sequester and subsequently release nutrients. It is also hypothesized that a number of mechanisms including competition for P and P bound to dissolved organic carbon, may be responsible for the P-deficiency noted in October.																			0003-9136					FEB	2001	150	3					435	455																WOS:000167356200006

Three fish species determined the main pathways of organic matter flow within the system: the predominantly planktivorous bream (Abramis brama), the obligate planktivorous smelt (Osmerus eperlanus), and the piscivorous pikeperch (Stizostedion lucioperca). Of the thirteen common zooplankton taxa Daphnia hyalina and cyclopoid copepods were utilized most by the planktivorous fish, while the large production of small cladocerans is almost left unutilized. The seasonal variations of production and consumption are large. This is mainly affected by seasonal variation of the water temperature.

J	DOUST, LL; DOUST, JL; BIERNACKI, M				DOUST, LL; DOUST, JL; BIERNACKI, M			AMERICAN WILD CELERY, VALLISNERIA-AMERICANA, AS A BIOMONITOR OF ORGANIC CONTAMINANTS IN AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												This paper assesses the value of American wildcelery, Vallisneria americana, as a biomonitor of organochlorine contamination. Plants provide a valuable indicator of local environmental conditions and sub-lethal effects of contaminants on growth and reproduction provide a means of assessing both acute and chronic contaminant effects. In a field survey, Vallisneria plants in the St. Clair and Detroit rivers were found to accumulate significant amounts of organochlorine contaminants, and the concentration increased over the season. Root tissue contained the highest concentrations on each occasion, suggesting contaminant transfer occurred from sediments to the roots. A factorial experiment was set up at two stations in the channel connecting Lakes Huron and Erie to assess the separate effects of contaminant concentrations in the sediment, water column, and source population of the plants, upon growth and reproduction of Vallisneria plants. Contaminant concentrations in sediment and plant tissues were also measured to correlate contaminant content and demographic effects. A clear relationship between exposure to contaminants and effect (on plant performance) was observed. Results indicated that exposure first to the water column, and secondarily to the sediments from the more contaminated site had detrimental effects on plant performance and survival. Plants at each site appeared to be locally adapted and differed in their apparent resistance to organochlorine contaminants. An ''impairment index'' (reflecting relative plant performance) was calculated and can be used to calibrate the degree of contamination of different sites relative to a ''clean '' reference site. This may allow prioritization of remediation of contaminated sites, and should allow field managers to track and document the restoration of environmental quality in recognized Areas of Concern in the Great Lakes.																			0380-1330						1994	20	2					333	354		10.1016/S0380-1330(94)71152-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(94)71152-7													WOS:A1994NZ71300002
J	EDWARDS, TWD; MCANDREWS, JH				EDWARDS, TWD; MCANDREWS, JH			PALEOHYDROLOGY OF A CANADIAN SHIELD LAKE INFERRED FROM O-18 IN SEDIMENT CELLULOSE	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												Oxygen- and carbon-isotope analyses on cellulose in the postglacial sediment of Weslemkoon Lake, southern Ontario, show that the cellulose came mainly from aquatic plants or algae, rather than from terrestrial sources. If a wholly aquatic source is assumed, the oxygen-isotope content permits inferences of lake-water .delta.18O values over the past 10,000 years by accounting for the isotopic fractionation that occurs during cellulose synthesis. Chronological control is provided by pollen analysis and six 14C dates. Our reconstruction shows lake-water .delta.18O fluctuated from about 5.permill. lower than present in the early postglacial to 5.permill. or more above present values during the mid-postglacial. These broad, secular shifts reflect a combination of fluctuating mean annual .delta.18O of local precipitation, evaporative isotopic enrichment of surface waters, and snowmelt-bypass effects. The first two factors reflect the changing paleotemperature and paleohydrology, respectively, whereas the third factor is a more speculative interpretation of isotope effects during snowmelt delivery to the lake. The snowmelt-bypass mechanism is supported by parallel changes in the overall abundance and seasonal distribution of precipitation. This effect is probably responsible for pronounced isotopic enrichment of the water throughout the moist climate of the past 6000 years.																			0008-4077	1480-3313				SEP	1989	26	9					1850	1859		10.1139/e89-158	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/e89-158													WOS:A1989CA56000018
J	WANG, XC; LEE, C				WANG, XC; LEE, C			THE DISTRIBUTION AND ADSORPTION BEHAVIOR OF ALIPHATIC-AMINES IN MARINE AND LACUSTRINE SEDIMENTS	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												The methylated amines.sbd.monomethyl-, dimethyl-, and trimethyl amine (MMA, DMA, TMA).sbd.are commonly found in aquatic environments, apparently as a result of decomposition processes. Adsorption of these amines to clay minerals and organic matter significantly influences their distribution in sediments. Laboratory measurements using 14C-radiolabelled amines and application of a linear partitioning model resulted in calculated adsorption coefficients of 2.4-4.7 (MMA), 3.3 (DMA), and 3.3-4.1 (TMA). Further studies showed that adsorption of amines is influenced by salinity of the porewaters, and clay mineral and organic matter content of the sediment solid phase. Concentrations of monomethyl- and dimethyl amine were measured in the porewaters and the solid phase of sediment samples collected from Flax Pond and Lake Ronkonkoma (NY), Long Island Sound, and the coastal Peru upwelling area. These two amines were present in all sediments investigated. A clear seasonal increase in the solid-phase concentration of MMA and DMA in Flax Pond sediments was likely related to the annual senescence of salt marsh grasses, either directly as a source of these compounds or indirectly by providing additional exchange capacity to the sediments. The distribution of amines in the solid and dissolved phases observed in all sediments investigated suggests that the distribution of these compounds results from a balance among production, decomposition, and adsorption processes.

J	Costamagna, LG; Knaust, D				Costamagna, Luca G.; Knaust, Dirk			Early Permian playa deposits of Sardinia, Italy, with reference to their ichnofauna	NEUES JAHRBUCH FUR GEOLOGIE UND PALAONTOLOGIE-ABHANDLUNGEN												The East sector of the post-Variscan Mulargia-Escalaplano Basin of central Sardinia, Italy preserves a 150-to 200-m -thick succession of continental sedimentary and volcanic deposits, pertaining to the red bed Upper Rotliegend Group (latest Carboniferous? to Middle Permian?). This group is formed by two superposed alluvial-lacustrine depositional cycles, respectively the Mulargia Formation and the Pegulari Formation, each one of them followed in turn by volcanic rocks represented by the Sa Fossada Rhyolitic Unit and by the Mataracui Andesitic Unit. The study of a well-exposed succession at the Pegulari locality showed that the intermediate part of the Permian Pegulari Formation in the Escalaplano area is characterized by cyclic siliciclastic, carbonate and minor evaporite deposits, with evidence of inorganic and organic deposition in a playa mud -flat to playa lake environment (possibly a recharge playa). Lake -shore shifts were probably influenced by seasonal fluctuations in an extremely dry climate. These deposits contain large burrow systems, which are tentatively attributed to the activity of tetrapods. They are associated with grooves along the upper bedding surface of a sandstone bed, which connect to burrow systems and show features of bioerosion. These grooves represent Sulcolithos aff. variabilis and were probably produced by freshwater polychaetes. This trace-fossil association from the Early Permian represents the first occurrence of Sulcolithos from a continental environment, beside evidence of macrobioerosion. If produced by crayfish, it would support phylogenetic assumptions that crayfish started to diverge in the Carboniferous-Permian, and polychaetes colonized freshwater to schizohaline environments with significant salinity changes. The evidenced depositional environment in the Sardinian Pegulari Formation shows close analogies with the Lower to Middle Permian Salagou Formation of the French Lodeve Basin, which differs from the former by its abundant fossil remains and trace fossils.																			0077-7749					JUN	2022	304	3					245	262		10.1127/njgpa/2022/1069	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/njgpa/2022/1069													WOS:000817731500001
J	Hudson, E; LaBelle, J; Reimer, A; Akbari, H				Hudson, Emily; LaBelle, James; Reimer, Ashton; Akbari, Hassanali			A Statistical Study of Auroral Medium Frequency Bursts and Anomalous Incoherent Scatter Radar Echoes	RADIO SCIENCE												Different types of incoherent scatter radar (ISR) echoes are observed associated with aurora, including some which have been interpreted as signatures of cavitating Langmuir turbulence (CLT). Akbari et al. (2013) discussed two instances of correlation between CLT and naturally occurring radio emissions called medium frequency burst (MFB) which occur at substorm onsets. Based on that observation, radio detections of MFB from Toolik Lake Observatory have been applied to investigate occurrence of CLT in ISR data from Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar and their possible correlation with MFB. Of 131 MFB events, 25 occurred within 15 min of an ISR echo detection, compared to 6 of 116 intervals of a control set with similar local time and seasonal distribution. The difference is significant at the 10(-4) level, suggesting that ISR echoes are more probable during substorm onset times identified using MFB as a proxy. However, only four observed ISR echoes coincident with one MFB event showed both specific characteristics consistent with CLT. Furthermore, investigation of the angle of arrival of MFB suggests that the electromagnetic emissions do not originate from the plasma volume where the ISR detects the echoes. The small number of coincident ISR echoes and MFB is expected due to the different volumes in which the emissions and the echoes are detected. 50% of the MFB events occurred within 20 min of a substorm onset independently identified versus 8% of the control set intervals, confirming the correlation of MFB with substorm onsets.

Features of Reproductive Biology of Invasive Species Gmelinoides fasciatus (Crustacea: Amphipoda) Inhabiting Lake Onega	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY												The paper considers features of the reproductive biology of invasive species Gmelinoides fasciatus (Stebbing, 1899) (Crustacea: Amphipoda) that contribute to its naturalization in recipient water bodies. The population of this species in the Petrozavodsk Bay of Lake Onega is characterized by the predominance of females over males and the formation of harems. This phenomenon contributes to the rapid growth in the number of alien amphipod species in the new environment. The fecundity of the species varied from three to 24 eggs per female. The study of the dynamics of embryonic development showed that two mass hatchings take place during the reproduction season in Lake Onega. The body size and age pattern of egg-bearing females have been characterized. A decrease in individual fecundity and average body size of females occurring during the reproduction season was associated with two massive hatchings. From the end of July, the females of the new generation of the current year begin to reach sexual maturity and gradually replace the females of the parental generation.					; Sidorova, Anastasiiy/AAD-4548-2022	Sidorova, Anastasia/0000-0002-3466-4062; 													1062-3604	1608-3326				JUN	2022	53	3					198	207		10.1134/S1062360422030079	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1062360422030079													WOS:000815083600005

Despite the relevance of fluorine to human nutrition, the ingestion of excessive doses can have adverse health effects such as fluorosis disease. Asembagus, Banyuputih, and Jangkar (ABJ) subdistricts in East Java, Indonesia, have been polluted by fluoride from the effluent of Kawah Ijen volcano crater-lake water. To prevent and mitigate the severe chronic effects of prolonged exposure to fluoride, a hazard zonation of the polluted area was developed. A spatial multi-criteria evaluation (SMCE) approach was applied to visualize the fluoride hazard zones based on the intrinsic properties of acid-neutral drainage distance factors. The spatial hazard model with 5x5 m(2) grid resolution showed that 15% of the area was in the very low zone, 22% in the low zone, 49% in the moderate zone, 7% in the high zone, and 7% in the very high zone, respectively. The moderate zone was associated with acid irrigation networks that watered paddy fields only during the dry season, and its contribution and mechanism of transport to groundwater fluoride pollution were still unclear. The cross-operation technique also revealed that six villages were in the high hazard zone with potential for dental fluorosis, and five villages were in the very high hazard zone with the potential for skeletal fluorosis chronic effect. Based on the condition of the drinking water source, the optimization of clean water networks and groundwater quality improvement following drinking water standards is needed. Risk communication about fluoride hazard zones should also be addressed in Asembagus, Banyuputih, and Jangkar subdistricts to reduce and mitigate long-term health effects.

J	GAISER, EE; BACHMANN, RW				GAISER, EE; BACHMANN, RW			THE ECOLOGY AND TAXONOMY OF EPIZOIC DIATOMS ON CLADOCERA	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We examined cladocerans from littoral and pelagic zones of 62 north temperate marshes and lakes during four sampling periods to collect and identify epizoic diatoms and correlate their presence and prevalence to limnological characteristics. Forty-nine diatom taxa were found on 20 species of Cladocera. Epizoic diatom assemblages on littoral cladocerans were diverse and contained typical epiphytic taxa. However, a single diatom taxon, Synedra cyclopum, comprised 63% of all epizoic diatoms and was most common on large pelagic Daphnia spp. Thirty-five percent of the study lakes had epizoic diatoms on cladocerans. These spanned a large range of trophic states and geographic regions and differed from lakes without epizoic diatoms by having cladoceran assemblages dominated by Daphnia spp. Prevalences and densities of epizoic diatoms were highest shortly after ice-out when the lakes were not stratified and temperatures were between 10 and 15-degrees-C. The seasonality of epizoic diatoms on Cladocera may result from a combination of temperature and nutrient preference of the diatoms and the temperature-dependent cladoceran molt rate. Densities averaged 11 9 cells per carapace in lakes with epizoic diatoms, with patterns of arrangement on the carapace and the relationship of density with prevalence indicating rapid growth of S. cyclopum on cladocerans. Such growth may represent a burden affecting cladoceran life history and behavior.

J	Gordon, E				Gordon, E			Vegetation and seed bank dynamics in a lacustrine harbaceous wetland (Venezuela)	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												Vegetation and seed banks association with seasonal water depth variations were studied in a herbaceous wetland of a tropical lake in Monagas, Venezuela. The sampling was done in 10x10 m(2) quadrates located at random in two zones of the lagoon. In each sampling four quadrates per zone were analyzed for relative species density, species richness, life forms and water depth. Soil samples were taken simultaneously for size and composition of the seed banks (seedling emergence method). Soil pH was five. The organic total fraction of the soil varied between 38% and 52%, and the conductivity between 114 and 182 mu mhos/cm. 50 species were recorded: 46% perennial herbs, 22% vines, 12% suffrutescents and 10% hydrophytes. The highest species richness was recorded during periods of rain and rain-dry transition. Hymenachne amplexicaulis, Leersia hexandra, Sacciolepis striata and Polygonum acuminatum were among the most important species numerically. The total density of seed bank varied between 5689 and 13936 seedlings/m(2). In the seed bank there were 58 species: 43% perennial herbs, 22% suffrutescents, 12% vines 9% annual herbs and 9%, hydrophytes. The highest species richness in the seed bank was during periods of dry and dry-rain transition. Cyperus odoratus, Eleocharis interstincta, Ludwigia hyssopifolia, L. lithospermifolia and Polygonum acuminatum had the highest densities. The potential flora of these wetlands included 76 species, but only 33 (43%) were common to the seed bank and the vegetation.																			0034-7744					MAR	2000	48	1					25	42																WOS:000088671400004

The results showed that the bass from Lake Naivasha are paratenic hosts of contracaecum sp. larva and final hosts for the acanthocephalan Polyacanthorhynchus kenyensis. The nematode occurred in large numbers in fish caught in the more saline Oloidien Bay but only in small numbers in those in the main lake. Bass in the main lake, however, were more heavily infected with acanthocephalans than those in Oloidien Bay. One of the major pathological effects of the acanthocephalan was perforation of the liver by the spiny proboscis. Seasonal variation was not apparent for either of the parasites. The intensity of infection by Contracaecum sp. larva increased with the size of the host and female fish were more heavily infected than males.																			0030-2465					JUN	1999	66	2					73	79											10486823					WOS:000082184600002

Suitable habitat including lakes, rivers, estuaries, mangroves, and marine islands was searched and at least 222 adult Madagascar Fish Eagles were observed including 63 breeding pairs, 36 probable pairs, 24 single adults and 18 immature birds. Assuming that all probable pairs were breeding, we estimated the Madagascar Fish Eagle breeding population was 99 pairs (95% confidence interval = 78 to 120) in the area searched. This estimate is about twice the number previously estimated in the period 1980-1985, due mainly, we believe, to our greater search effort, although we cannot discount an increase in the breeding population. The number of breeding pairs has declined since 1985 in some localities, suggesting a population decline or movement of pairs away from these sites. We recommend annual monitoring of a random sample of known breeding pairs until causes for the species' rarity have been limited and no evidence of population decline is detected, followed by monitoring at least every five years until the species can be removed from the endangered list.

Mean daily measurements of global solar radiation, downward longwave radiation, wind speed, air temperature and water surface temperature were used as input data and lake temperature as the calculated output data of the model. To calibrate performance of the new equation, calculated lake temperature was compared with measured lake temperature during both the mixing and the stratified period of the lake. The new coefficients in the wind function to calculate the non-radiative fluxes at the water surface were assumed to depend on the variability of the wind speed, the air temperature of the study area and the surface temperature of the lake. In addition, the results were used to estimate the heat balance of the air-water interface of Lake Banyoles over a period of two years. The processes that have been taken into account are shortwave and longwave radiation, back-radiation emitted by the lake, sensible and latent heat and throughflow.					; Colomer, Jordi/Y-5386-2018; Roget, Elena/C-3689-2009	casamitjana, xavier/0000-0003-1662-9076; Roget, Elena/0000-0002-4950-0204; Colomer, Jordi/0000-0002-9330-0269													0885-6087					MAY	1996	10	5					721	726		10.1002/(SICI)1099-1085(199605)10:5<721::AID-HYP314>3.0.CO;2-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1099-1085(199605)10:5<721::AID-HYP314>3.0.CO;2-0													WOS:A1996UP51000005

Lakes were sampled one to eight times between 1979 and 1985, and a total of 899 pike were examined (mean standard length = 44 .+-. 8 cm, SD). Although northern pike are widely considered to be top aquatic piscivores, we found that the frequency of occurrence of invertebrates was high, at least on a seasonal basis, in some systems. In all of the lakes considered, the frequency of occurrence of fish (expressed as a percentage of non-empty stomachs) was 88% or greater in one or more of the sample periods. However, diets where the frequency of occurrence of invertebrates was greater than 90% occurred in three of the populations in one or more of the sample periods. The frequency of occurrence of invertebrates was negatively correlated with the percentage of empty stomachs, while the frequency of occurrence of fish was positively related to the percentage of empty stomachs. Invertebrate feeding was not limited exclusively to smaller pike; invertebrates were found in the stomachs of pike 24 to 60 cm long (standard length).																			0706-652X	1205-7533				APR	1989	46	4					666	669		10.1139/f89-085	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f89-085													WOS:A1989U023600014

The objective of this study was to relate the occurrence and seasonal distribution of the benthic macrofauna, especially larvae of Chironomidae (Insecta: Diptera) to the activities of a bauxite mine during the rainy season (May-June) and the dry season (October-November) in 1994 and 1995, at three sampling stations (comparing a reference site to polluted sites). Over the four collecting periods, we found low generic richness and low densities of Chironomidae. The chironomids Chironomus, Goeldichironomus, and Polypedilum predominated in the study area. The fine-grained bauxite tailings, dispersed by local currents, have covered much of the river bottom with drastic consequences for the benthic macrofauna.

Two 2-year long simulations were conducted using coupled model with water table and the uncoupled (without water table) for wet and dry periods. Influence of water table on land-atmosphere coupling and interconnections among precipitation, soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and surface energy fluxes were examined. Overall, the coupled model simulated significantly higher monthly rainfall amounts during both the short (March-May) and long (October-December) rains of the wet year, which was more consistent with observations particularly over the lake surface and immediate hinterlands. Simulated monthly rainfall differences between coupled and uncoupled were pronounced during the peak of long rains, exceeding 100mm over the lake surface. Toward the end of the rainfall season (May) the difference was minimal. During the short rains significant differences occurred mostly in November, especially over the eastern shores. But during the relatively dry year minimal differences were generally witnessed throughout the year except in May, east of Lake Victoria. The coupled model simulated stronger matching among rainfall, soil moisture, and evapotranspiration over areas with shallow water table, for example in Kisumu to the east and Bukoba to the west. In these areas coupled model simulated higher soil moisture corresponding to higher evapotranspiration and precipitation. These interconnections were more pronounced during short and long rains in 1997 (wet) compared to 2010 (dry). Wet conditions over the gulf of Kisumu corresponded with rise in water table especially during October-December 1997 consistent with ENSO-related flooding over the area. Hence, our study demonstrated that incorporating water table resulted in realistic interconnections between precipitation, soil moisture, ET, and surface energy fluxes, and could improve simulation and prediction of spatial-temporal evolution of wet and dry conditions over Lake Victoria Basin.

Using Program MARK, we analyzed data from resighting surveys to assess whether hihi had lower than normal survival in the 6-week interval following the drop. The resighting data were collected on a regular basis over a 3-year period, from 1994-97, allowing us to control for yearly and seasonal variation in resighting and survival probabilities. We initially established that the Cormack-Jolly-Seber model had a good fit to the data and could therefore be used as the global model for our analysis. We then compared a range of simpler candidate models, some of which included a poison effect (an unusual survival rate for the interval after the poison drop). Under the best model (that with the lowest AIC), the survival probability was constant over time and there was no poison effect. The estimated survival probability for the 6 weeks after the poison drop was 0.95, which is slightly higher than the value of 0.89 expected based on pre- and post-poison intervals. The approximate 95% confidence interval for the probability of a bird dying due to poison ranged from -0.17 (i.e., a decrease in mortality rate due to the poison) to +0.04. We therefore concluded that the poison caused at most a negligible increase in mortality, and that mark-recapture analysis on resighting data provided a powerful method for assessing the impact of the poison drop. We discuss the relative costs and benefits of radio tagging versus resighting surveys of banded birds for estimating impacts of poison operations. For species with relatively high resighting rates, such as hihi, analysis of resighting surveys is a much more reliable and cost-efficient methodology.

Existing loss records for some states cover the 1948-present period; this span is helpful but is not long enough to define trends, possible fluctuations, and extremes adequately. The only other hail data with much longer records are the frequencies of hail days collected at National Weather Service stations since 1901, and a newly developed database for the major hail-loss states that contains hail-day data for 910 cooperative stations for 1901-94. This study tested two methods for estimating the historical loss values using hail-day data; one method produced modified hail-day values found to relate closely to loss values in the nation's 21 primary hail-loss states. The method involved modifying a station's hail-day values for each of the crop-season months using insurance-derived monthly hail intensity indices, resulting in an annual hail-intensity-weighted value. These weighted values of each year were combined using all stations in the crop regions of a state. The state-weighted annual indices were compared with the insurance loss values and yielded correlation coefficients of +0.60 or higher in 18 of 21 states; the resulting regression equations were used to estimate the loss values for the 1901-47 period. The temporal fluctuations and trends in the state hail intensity and loss values for 1901-94 showed major regional differences. States in the High Plains had increasing losses and greater variability with time, whereas states near the Great Lakes exhibited decreasing hail losses and variability with time. The approach can also be used to estimate loss values for areas for which historical loss values do not exist.																			0894-8763						2001	40	1					84	91		10.1175/1520-0450(2001)040<0084:AMFECL>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0450(2001)040<0084:AMFECL>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000166476000006

CYBIUM												The diet of 81 specimens (with 63 stomachs containing preys) of Synodontis bastiani from the Bia river (Ivory Coast) was examined in relation to the specimen size, the hydrological season and the site of study. A feeding index was computed by combining the occurrence, numerical and weight of percentages of the items identified in the stomach contents. This examination revealed for this species an omnivorous diet mainly composed of benthic invertebrates and higher plant materials. The dominants food items were the larvae of Chironomidae, the Insect Povilla adusta (Polymitarcyidae), fruits and macrophyte fragments. This study showed differences in diet in relation to the size of the specimens, the hydrological season and the site except in man-made lake where no statistically significant difference was observed between the diet composition and the hydrological season.

Annual production (production, P) was 0 to 477 mg dry weight/m(2) at three stations where pollution and sediment grain-size distribution limited the population, and was 738 to 5,255 mg dry weight/m(2) at the other 13 stations. The highest production value measured for Hexagenia in Lake St. Clair was about three times higher than the highest value reported for other areas in the northern United States and Canada (39 degrees to 53 degrees North latitude). The production-mean annual biomass (biomass, B) ratio (P/B) for Hexagenia in Lake St. Clair in 1995-96 was described by the straight line P = 2.4 B (R-2 = 0.94). Adding published P/B data for other North American populations changed the relation only slightly to P = 2.5B (R-2 = 0.96). A P/B ratio of 2.5 is consistent with the expected value for an aquatic insect with a 2-year life cycle and overlapping cohorts, and these data suggest this relation has general applicability for estimating production of Hexagenia in the northern United States and Canada. Size-class and seasonal partitioning of Hexagenia biomass and production were evident in the data. Both biomass and production were highest among nymphs 16. 0 mm and larger, and biomass was highest in October and again in June, immediately before the annual emergence of subimagos. The large size of the mature nymphs and the concentration of biomass and production among the larger nymphs in the population is consistent with their importance in the diets of many fishes in the northern United States and Canada.																			0380-1330						2001	27	4					449	456		10.1016/S0380-1330(01)70659-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(01)70659-4													WOS:000173010400005

However, continuation of existing levels of N deposition may undermine the environmental benefits derived from SO, control. This likelihood has been assessed for Canadian lakes. Maximum N deposition (similar to 13 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) occurs in south-central Ontario and southwestern Quebec. Regional median NO3- levels are generally low (<5 mu eg L(-1)) suggesting that on average, N-based acidification is minor compared to the S-based component. However, examination of the seasonal NO3- pattern at 5 intensively monitored basins reveals that 2 of them (in Ontario and Quebec) have incipient N saturation. A regional status for nitrogen-based acidification was qualitatively assessed by classifying survey data to identify cases of NO; leaching. Many lakes throughout southeastern Canada exhibit some leaching, particularly those in south-central Ontario and southwestern Quebec. While the evidence for a deposition-acidification link appears strong, sources of N other than the atmosphere should be considered for certain anomalous cases.																			0049-6979					DEC	1995	85	2					433	438		10.1007/BF00476867	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00476867													WOS:A1995UB05300025

Otoliths were extracted, sectioned, and growth ring-specific samples of calcium carbonate were milled to obtain samples for determination of oxygen isotope ratios (delta(18)O values). The delta(18)O values of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in accretionary structures such as otoliths allow calculation of growth temperatures of the fish, because of differential fractionation of oxygen isotopes at different temperatures. Growth temperatures of 10 St. Marys River lake herring were compared with take and catch data as well as growth temperatures of lake herring collected from Lake Huron and other ciscoes from the Great Lakes. Results of this analysis indicate that these fish remained in the bays of the St. Marys River for their entire life history. After their second year they grew at average temperatures between 11 degreesC and 13 degreesC, consistent with temperature in the warmer bays of the St. Marys River and 6 degreesC higher than expected for growth of this species in Lake Huron.					; Patterson, William/J-6473-2012	Patterson, William/0000-0003-3387-708X; 													0071-1128		3-510-47059-1				2002	57						453	461																WOS:000180355400038
J	MEILI, M				MEILI, M			FLUXES, POOLS, AND TURNOVER OF MERCURY IN SWEDISH FOREST LAKES	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												In boreal forest lakes, high Hg concentrations in fish are common, even in remote areas. Data from recent Swedish surveys were synthesized to assess source, sinks, fluxes and turnover rates of Hg in headwater lakes of different type, to determine and quantify controlling factors and their relative influence, and to discuss implications for the contamination of fish and potential remedial actions. In humic lakes, annual input of Hg is dominated by the transport from forest soils, whereas in clearwater lakes, direct deposition on the lake surface is often more important. Direct deposition is more likely to dominate during the growing season when the water discharge in forest streams is low. Sedimentation of Hg is largely controlled by the water residence time and is related to water quality. In clearwater lakes, most of the Hg load is deposited in the sediment, which is in contrast to humic lakes, and which partly explains the susceptibility of headwater lakes to atmospheric Hg pollution. The fish community contains about half or more of the methylmercury pool in the water column, and internal recycling in the food web may be important. However, only a minor fraction of the total annual Hg load to lakes is channeled through the fish community. As this allows large variations in the ecological fractionation and bioavailability of Hg, differences in Hg fluxes can only partly explain the wide range of Hg concentrations found in fish from different lakes. The annual Hg load to headwater lakes exceeds the total Hg pool in the water column by a factor of up to 20. Single remedial measures aiming at the removal of Hg from the water column are therefore likely to have little success. Local actions should aim primarily at reducing the bioavailability of the Hg entering the lakes and need to be repeated continuously.

Two general mechanisms influencing the evolutionary development of these high biodiversities can be hypothesized; i.e., a bottom-up constraint depending on the availability of food resources, and a top-down effect exerted by predators especially within the fish assemblage. The bottom-up constraint may be prominent where the abundance of benthic organisms in the grazing-food-chain is restricted by a seasonally lowest production, referring chiefly to attached algae, and large fluctuations in the abundance of primary producers provide a resource that is eventually utilized by benthic organisms of the detritus-food-chain. The top-down effect may be realized where the most of benthic organisms are supported by a constantly large primary production. These hypotheses help to explain, for the lakes we cite, the facts that diverse grazing-food-chain organisms live on the littoral bottom of tropical lakes where there is relatively constant large algal production due to suitable conditions of water temperature and light penetration through the year; while on the other hand, detritus-food-chain organisms are predominant on the littoral bottom of a boreal lake with seasonally fluctuating algal production and its pronounced lowest production in a year. In fish communities, segregations in habitat and food resource are important mechanisms allowing development of high species packing, while cohabitation within predatory fishes increases their feeding success due to the decrease of defensive efficiency by the threat of a variety of attacking methods. A further top-down effect may be exerted by scale-eating fishes, especially in Lake Tanganyika. The presence of such predatory and harmful members may promote more dense packing of prey members to increase their mutual defense efficiency.

Solms] cultured in eutrophic Lake Apopka water, and the decomposition of detritus in situ and under laboratory conditions. Annual averages for C, N and P deposited through detritus production at the sediment-water interface were 2870, 176 and 19 kg ha-1 yr-1, respectively. Decomposition rates were faster in the root zone of hyacinth mats than at the sediment-water interface. Approximately 92% of the detritus C deposited at the sediment-water interface was decomposed in one year, while only 11% of the detrital organic N was mineralized. Detrital tissue gained P during decomposition, suggesting P limitation for the system. Dry-weight loss of detrital tissue was significantly correlated with the mass of C lost (r2 = 0.947**), C/N ratio (r2 = 0.644**) and C/P ratio (r2 = 0.428**).																			0018-8158					MAR 22	1991	211	2					101	109		10.1007/BF00037366	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00037366													WOS:A1991FG24300003
J	WILSON, SD; KEDDY, PA				WILSON, SD; KEDDY, PA			SPECIES RICHNESS, SURVIVORSHIP, AND BIOMASS ACCUMULATION ALONG AN ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENT	OIKOS												Several ecological theories relate variation in species richness to environmental disturbance or stress. But measures of disturbance and stress are often indirect and inferred from factors associated with productivity, such as standing crop, rainfall, or depth in the ocean. This study examined variation in plant species richness in relation to the survivorship and growth of twelve species along a lakeshore gradient of exposure to wave action. Species richness was maximum at intermediate levels of exposure to wave action and standing crop. We tested whether survivorship and growth also varied with exposure by growing ramets of twelve common species, in the absence of neighbours, at seven locations along the exposure gradient. After two growing seasons, the survivorship of ten species varied significantly along the gradient. For all twelve species considered together, survivorship was weakly but significantly correlated with position on the gradient, with highest survivorship found on sheltered shores. Biomass accumulation varied significantly with position on the gradient in the cases of five species and tended to be greatest on sheltered shores. Biomass accumulation of the remaining species did not vary along the gradient. For all twelve species considered together, growth varied weakly but significantly with position on the gradient and was highest on sheltered shores. The weakness of the relationships between exposure and survivorship and growth is likely attributable to variability among species and illustrates the difficulty of considering disturbance and stress as factors which affect all species in a community in the same manner.

Models of ecological half-life may be valuable and cost-effective predictive tools for authorities setting restrictions on human consumption of freshwater fish after environmental releases of radioactivity. This work aimed to validate such a model for radioactive caesium (Cs-134 and Cs-137) in brown trout Salmo trutta populations. Data were drawn from lakes with a wide variability in abiotic and biotic factors and initial caesium load. 2. In Norway, the highest fallout (more than 150 kBq m(-2) of Cs-137) from the Chernobyl accident occurred in Oppland county, in south central Norway. Radioactivity was measured in more than 1800 samples of brown trout in nearly 100 localities in this region during 1986-95. 3. The back-calculated maximum initial radioactivity on 1 January 1987 showed a strong regional variability (range 443-13 370; average 3855 Bq kg(-1)). Large variation in initial radioactivity was also recorded on a local scale (within 50 km). 4. The ecological half-life model for caesium in brown trout populations for 1987-94/95 gave a close fit to real data from all localities with sufficient time series. Predicted half-lives ranged from 1.2 to 4.2 years (average 2.5) but 95% confidence limits were narrow (2.7 and 2.3 years). 5. The overall variability in radioactivity levels over time was almost entirely related to the initial load and, with few exceptions, 88% of the changes in radioactivity was explained by the simple regression model. Modest variability in ecological half-life was not correlated with initial activity, and no clear effects of water quality or season could be detected. For most lakes, levels of radioactivity in brown trout appeared to be predictable, with high accuracy after a fallout event, without extensive information on population ecology and water quality. However, more detailed work may be required to assess patterns within individual lakes.

From field and lab data was noted that seasonal and annual deposition of pollen grains on the lake bottom was disturbed in the main basin by an increase in water mass dynamics and by resuspension and focusing. Greater concordance between pollen sedimentation and the flowering periods of plants was found in the bay area, where sediment resuspension took place sporadically and with less intensity, compared to the main basin. Futhermore, it is suggested that resuspension of pollen can occur even if laminated sediments are formed, a process which therby diminishes the chronostratigraphic value of sediments and pollen analyses.																			0921-2728					FEB	2000	23	2					129	140																WOS:000086422700002

An important source of P for Lake Okeechobee is runoff of soluble P fertilizer applied to bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum Flugge) pastures. A study was conducted to ascertain whether P application levels could be reduced below current agronomic recommendations without affecting pasture yields or quality and to determine the effects of P application on surface water quality. A field study was conducted on a bahiagrass pasture to assess the yield response of bahiagrass to five annual rates of P (0, 6, 12, 24, and 48 kg ha-1) and two application times (dry season and wet season). Fertilizer treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block design with four replications on an Immokalee fine sand (sandy, siliceous, hyperthermic Arenic Haplaquods). Results indicate that P fertilization rates could be reduced from 48 to 24 kg P ha-1 without affecting yields or quality of bahiagrass. Yields in 1989 averaged 11.4, 14,7, and 10.4 Mg ha-1 for the 48, 24, and 0 kg P ha-1 treatments, respectively. Time of P application had no effect on yields or quality of bahiagrass. There was a linear increase in Mehlich I extractable P in the A and E horizons and a quadratic increase to P in the Bh horizon in 1989. Extractable P ranged from 3.8 to 22.5, 1.3 to 2.5, and 21 to 55 mg P kg-1 for the A, E, and Bh horizons, respectively. Phosphorus concentrations in surface water runoff was reduced from 33 to 60% as P application rates were decreased from 48 to 12 kg P ha-1 while total P loss was reduced from 17 to 78%, respectively. Recommended reductions in P application should result in substantial cost savings to producers and also reduce P inputs into surface water.																			0002-1962	1435-0645				MAY-JUN	1992	84	3					463	468		10.2134/agronj1992.00021962008400030021x	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj1992.00021962008400030021x													WOS:A1992HZ22900020

The terrestrial and aquatic resources within the basin are representative of the surrounding region of Algoma, although for Ontario, it does have high relief (290 m) and high annual precipitation (> 1200 mm). The TLW contains a chain of four lakes (five distinct lake basins) that range from 5.8 to 52.0 ha in area and 2.2 to 12.2 m in mean depth. The lakes are dimictic and, except for the deepest lake, experience dissolved oxygen depletion in undisturbed bottom waters. There is a gradient in the major ion composition of lakes within the TLW, the most dilute waters occurring at high elevations. Calcium levels increase from 55 to 138 .mu.mol .cntdot. L-1 down the chain. Sulphate is the dominant lake water anion in the headwater lake, while alkalinity dominates in the lowest lake. Phosphorus is the limiting nutrient in these lakes; NO3-N levels are relatively high (7.9-16.4 .mu.mol .cntdot. L-1) because the terrestrial basin exhibits low utilization of this nitrogen species. Seasonal and episodic variations in surface water composition can be large. The headwater lake contains no fish; however, fish communities in the lower three lakes (composed of 8-11 species) are typical of the Algoma region. The distribution of benthic organisms is primarily a function of lake depth and presence/absence of fish rather than variations in water chemistry. Zooplankton species composition is similar across all lakes, and cyanophytes are the dominant algae throughout. The forest is an uneven-aged, mature-to-overmature, old-growth tolerant hardwood stand. The principle tree species is sugar maple (90%) with lesser amounts of other hardwoods (9%, usually yellow birch) and various conifers (1%).

This study was carried out to estimate the dilution process of Lake Basaka and its maximum neutralization period to use the water resource for various purposes. Eight sampling points were chosen to reflect consideration of all possible activities that may affect lake water quality. Sampling points were taken in the dry and wet seasons of the Awash River and Basaka Lake to verify the current status of water quality in the years 2021 The water quality of Awash River showed that almost all selected parameters concentration was below the permissible limits of [20]. This indicates the water quality of Awash River has good quality. The water quality of Lake Basaka result showed that there was a higher concentration of electric conductivity, carbonate, bicarbonate, chloride, and sodium which indicates poor quality. The dilution of the lake with Awash River was the best alternative to neutralize the lake water and use it for different purposes. The mixing ratio of the Awash River and Lake Basaka was fixed in the laboratory. As a result, 5:95 is the best ratio to neutralize Lake Basaka. Lake Basaka neutralization period was fixed in lake water and Awash River dilution. By considering the quality and quantity of lake and River water, the lake water would be restored in a period of 4 years. The study concluded that dilution and control of external loading restore the lake in to good condition within four years.

J	AUVINEN, H; JURVELIUS, J				AUVINEN, H; JURVELIUS, J			COMPARISON OF PELAGIC VENDACE (COREGONUS-ALBULA) STOCK DENSITY-ESTIMATION METHODS IN A LAKE	FISHERIES RESEARCH												The density of pelagic vendace stock in a deep Finnish lake (110 km2) during the period 1984-1992 was estimated by five methods. Relative fish density estimates (virtual population analysis, depletion method, catch-per-unit-effort, hydroacoustics and length of 1-year-old vendace) were able to show the direction of change in density. All density estimates for 1+ vendace had a strong negative correlation with the length of 1-year-old vendace of the same cohort. The VPA and depletion methods resulted in similar numerical estimates at high stock densities. The estimates differed at low densities. Hydroacoustics produced lower estimates than the other absolute methods, especially in the years when 1+ vendace dominated. The length-density index predicted the catch of 1+ vendace in the following season (r2 = 0.78, n = 8, P = 0.004) and hydroacoustic density estimates predicted the total vendace catch (r2 = 0.87, n = 6, P = 0.006).																			0165-7836					FEB	1994	19	1-2					31	50		10.1016/0165-7836(94)90013-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0165-7836(94)90013-2													WOS:A1994MY25200003

GIC proglacial lake records have been increasingly used to reconstruct Holocene glacier behaviour, largely focusing on macrostratigraphy. However, despite the wide range of topographic settings and catchment characteristics, there has been little systematic analysis of the ways that catchment conditions are registered in the clastic sediments of GIC lakes. Such signals provide valuable insights into landscape processes and palaeoenvironmental conditions that are not routinely captured in other Quaternary glacial morphosedimentary archives. This review synthesises sedimentological and geochemical evidence from existing Holocene GIC proglacial lake records to establish: how catchment-wide conditions have been recorded in the lacustrine sequences; and our ability to isolate these signals to enhance palaeoenvironmental reconstruction. Our review shows that with careful sedimentological and targeted (bio)geochemical analyses coupled with a clear process-based understanding, catchment and in-lake signals can be effectively identified in the microstratigraphic and mineral grain record. Such signals include wind patterns, mass wasting, precipitation events and seasonal lake ice cover, that can complement broader palaeoclimatic proxy evidence. The approaches collated here, if more widely applied, could considerably enhance environmental reconstructions not only in Greenland, but in glaciated catchments elsewhere.					; Lane, Timothy/AAA-8909-2022; Delaney, Catherine/ABC-4976-2021	Lane, Timothy/0000-0002-7116-9976; Delaney, Catherine/0000-0002-5846-2377													0267-8179	1099-1417				NOV	2022	37	8					1388	1406		10.1002/jqs.3423	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jqs.3423		APR 2022											WOS:000782004000001

Qualitatively, Cyanobacteria were represented in this biotope by 6 species: Planktothrix mougeotii, Oscillatoria putrida, Microcystis aeruginosa, M. wesenbergii, Merimopedia punctata and Aphanocapsa elachista. These species represented about 6% of phytoplankton taxa recorded in this lake. Quantitatively, this algae group developed almost exclusively during the dry seasons. Their maximum biomass, representing 44% and 38% of the total phytoplankton biomass, was recorded at the end of December and at the end of August, respectively. The vertical distribution of Cyanobacteria in this water body followed a unique pattern; the main part of the biomass was concentrated in the uppermost metre layer of the water column, and dominated by P. mougeotii. Temperature constituted the main factor controlling cyanobacterial efflorescence in this lake, this factor being associated with the relative constant weather conditions prevailing during dry seasons. The pH fluctuations in the lake appear to be the consequence of Cyanobacteria bloom formation.																			0003-9136					MAR	2003	156	4					495	510		10.1127/0003-9136/2003/0156-0495	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/0003-9136/2003/0156-0495													WOS:000182598500005

The abundance (1.4 x 10(3) - 20.4 x 10(3) cells l-1, mean = 4.8 x 10(3) cells l-1) and biomass (0.5-34.6 mug C l-1, mean = 6.0 mug C l-1) of ciliated protozoa were low and close to values reported for oligotrophic environments. The species composition of the population varied greatly with depth. Whereas large-sized species of oligotrichs, some of which were mixotrophic, dominated at the surface, haptorids were best represented in deep waters.

J	Fei, J				Fei, Jie			Water level change of Lake Machang in eastern China over 1814-1902 CE	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												Lake Machang, occupying an area of approximately 30 km(2) in the city of Jining, eastern China, was a historical reservoir on the Grand Canal from the early 15th century to early 20th century. The premodern monthly water level observation of Lake Machang commenced in 1814 CE and ended in 1902 CE. The available observation data from the monthly records covered 75.6 % of the entire study period of 1814-1902. Although the water level was seemingly artificially influenced by human activities, monthly and annual water level changes still correlated well with precipitation. That is, climate is still the dominant factor in water level changes on seasonal and annual scales. The flooding of the Yellow River in 1871 carried a large amount of silt into Lake Machang, which resulted in the rise of the lake bed and reclamation initiated by local residents. After the reclamation activity was officially approved in 1900, Lake Machang was massively reclaimed and eventually dried up in the early 20th century.																			1814-9324	1814-9332				APR 1	2022	18	3					649	655		10.5194/cp-18-649-2022	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-18-649-2022													WOS:000776735400001

Here, the field performance of a novel CWCS was evaluated in a eutrophic reservoir (Shingal reservoir, South Korea) for three seasons between September 2016 and September 2018. The CWCS was deployed in a corner of stagnated water in the reservoir. The changes in water temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations at different water depths were examined at the deployment site and two control sites within the stagnant area during the 2016 and 2017 seasons. In 2018, the performance of the CWCS in replicating natural mixing was assessed by monitoring water temperature changes at different depths at the CWCS unit deployment site and a comparison site with natural water flow. The differences in water temperature and DO concentrations between the epilimnion and the hypolimnion were significantly smaller at the deployment site than at the control sites, demonstrating the effectiveness of the CWCS in vertical and horizontal mixing as well as in oxygen transfer. The findings of the field study revealed that the CWCS effectively induced natural-like mixing without disturbing the hypolimnion.

The aim of this study was to better understand ET changes caused by the rapid expansion of C4 (corn) cover and rapid changes in stomatal conductance, which may be amplified in the future due to environmental and human-contributing factors, such as climate change and agricultural practices. Linking the enlargement of agricultural land with the physiological properties of crops, such as photosynthetic adaptations and stomatal conductance, is necessary to explore the magnitude of these impacts. This study examined the effects of increased C4 (corn) crop cover and stomatal conductance on evapotranspiration (ET) rates in the Lower Maumee River Watershed, Ohio, USA, during the 2018 growing season. Simulation results using a modified-for-crops version of the Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator (BEPS) showed that a hypothetical increase of corn cover by as much as 100% would not significantly impact the watershed ET rate, with a 5.05% overall increase in ET in July and a 3.96% increase in August. Changes in the stomatal conductance of crops, however, impacted ET more. The results showed a significant increase in the ET rate (up to 24.04% for corn and 5.10% for soybean) for the modeling scenario that integrated high stomatal conductance, which agreed with the thermal-based ECOSTRESS ET product derived over the study area (+/-0.9 mm day(-1)) for the same period. We suggest that the alteration of the crop stomata mechanism, caused largely by rapid climate change and intensive farming practices, should be carefully quantified, and its impact on hydrology at the ecosystem level further explored.					; Yacobucci, Margaret/V-9978-2019	Liu, Ganming/0000-0002-5893-555X; Senevirathne, Chathuranga/0000-0002-7909-7014; Simic Milas, Anita/0000-0003-1573-1925; Yacobucci, Margaret/0000-0003-1950-0622														2072-4292				APR	2022	14	8							1914	10.3390/rs14081914	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14081914													WOS:000787402600001

Variation in trophic niches of fish in Lake Powell prior to full colonization by quagga mussel (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis)	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST												Invasive species can cause disruption of the trophic niche of resident species such that patterns of energy flow through ecological systems are altered. Quagga mussel Dreissena rostriformis bugensis Andrusov, 1897, a notorious invasive species, was introduced to Lake Powell (Utah and Arizona, USA) in 2012 and colonized the entire reservoir by 2017. To help understand potential effects of this invasive species on the trophic niche of fishes in Lake Powell, we characterized trophic niche of fishes and other organisms, as well as sources of variation in trophic niche, using stable isotope analysis of carbon and nitrogen prior to full colonization by quagga mussels. Trophic niche positions of fishes and other organisms in Lake Powell were consistent with other large lake or reservoir systems, consisting of 4 trophic levels and pelagic and littoral energy pathways. Trophic niche size decreased with increased trophic level among fishes, and there was high overlap in trophic niche among top predators. Trophic niche of fishes varied between northern and southern regions of the lake, among seasons, and, in some species, with body size. Basal trophic species (algae and chironomids) varied little between northern and southern regions and across years. Quagga mussels occupied a position in the food web where they were likely to directly impact the pelagic energy pathway, but resulting effects on trophic niche of fishes may be variable between regions of the lake.

We developed models that predict the availability of such habitat, using lake mean depth, which describes both the thermal regime and the initial oxygen reserves, and using a measure of primary productivity, which defines the subsequent oxygen demand of the sediments and water column. Measures of primary production include either phosphorus concentration, chlorophyll a concentration, or Secchi disk transparency. The models are presented as a series of seasonal oxygen depletion isopleths that predict the extent to which the oxygen content of thermally suitable habitat is lost during the period of thermal stratification. The presence or absence of native lake trout in lakes of northwestern Ontario superimposed on these graphs indicated that natural populations seldom occur in lakes in which the seasonal oxygen depletion exceeds 40%. This isopleth is a niche boundary in its representation of adverse temperature and oxygen conditions for lake trout. The delineation of this boundary permits the identification of lakes where lake trout populations could be seriously affected by cultural eutrophication, overfishing, or climate warming.																			0706-652X					NOV	1994	51	11					2513	2519		10.1139/f94-250	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f94-250													WOS:A1994QY71700012

Procambarus (Austrocambarus) llamasi is endemic to the Yucatan Peninsula, distributed in epicontinental water bodies, including lakes, marshes and flood plains, which may be relatively isolated. Due to the fragmented nature of its habitat, it might be expected to find highly structured populations with unique haplotypes. To describe the genetic variation of the different populations of P. llamasi and their distribution pattern, a phylogeographic analysis was performed using the mitochondrial COI gene. A 643 base pair fragment was sequenced from 53 individuals of ten populations. Different haplotypes were identified and a haplotype network was built using statistical parsimony for nested clade analysis. A total of 14 variable sites were found, 12 of which were informative; all nucleotide changes were transitions and nucleotide diversity was Pi = 0.0045. Ten haplotypes were found with a diversity of HD = 0.532, with one of them widely distributed. The nested clade analysis shows that current haplotypes are the result of a contiguous range expansion, suggesting that the source of the expansion was at the southern portion of the peninsula. This may occur due to the seasonal floodings in the region, which can create temporary connections between populations.

Apodermus flavicollis and Microtus arvalais from Mazury Lakes District of Poland were examined for antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi by enzyme-labelled protein G assay (ELGA). C. glareolus had an exceptionally high prevalence of B. burgdorferi antibodies - 58%, but A. flavicollis and M. arvalis also showed significant prevalence of 16.6% and 10.5%. respectively. The ELGA method is highly specific with good reproducibility. Nevertheless, some differences of sensitivity of assessed samples were season dependent. However, high seroprevalence did not coincide with infestation rates of examined rodents by I. ricinus ticks. The results indicated that in Mazury Lakes District, naturally infected rodents play an important role as an animal reservoir host for B. burgdorferi, and these animals may increase the risk of human infections in some habitats used as recreation areas.

Two hundred and sixty four couplets were identified and measured using a newly developed image-analysis technique that produces records of seasonal and total varve thickness. On the premise that changes in varve thickness can serve as a proxy for climate variability, we use this information, along with oxygen-isotope records and seismic reflection profile data, to characterize a period immediately following the Younger Dryas. A time-series analysis of the thickness data was performed using two different techniques to characterize changes in spectral density that occur throughout the time span of the record. The results indicate that there are concentrations in variance that occur in the same frequency band as the quasi-periodic El Nino - Southern oscillation (ENSO) and the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO).

Cormorants have been reported to nest sporadically in the southern United States. The only reported nesting by cormorants in Mississippi was reported in Tunica county near clayton in May 1952. During the 1998 annual Mississippi colonial waterbird survey by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, four nesting pairs of Double-crested Cormorants were found. Two nesting pairs were located at Lewis Swamp in Coahoma County Mississippi, and two nesting pairs were located at Jones Lake in Warren County, Mississippi. The two nests at Lewis Swamp were removed by an undetermined source within two weeks of their discovery. The nesting colony at Jones Lake increased from two to 31 nests over a four-month observation period. Of the 31 nests, 13 successfully fledged at least one young. Incubation of the first clutch began on 24 April 1998 and all young had fledged by 18 September 1998. If breeding cormorants continue to increase in Mississippi, the agriculture industry may have to contend with cormorant depredation not only as a seasonal occurrence but as a year-round issue.																			0738-6028						1998	21	3					450	451		10.2307/1521660	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1521660													WOS:000080711400019
J	Aslan, A; Autin, WJ				Aslan, A; Autin, WJ			Depositional and pedogenic influences on the environmental geology of Holocene Mississippi River floodplain deposits near Ferriday, Louisiana	ENGINEERING GEOLOGY					Conference on Geology in the Lower Mississippi Valley - Implications for Engineering, the Half Century Since Fisk 1944	DEC 05-08, 1994	VICKSBURG, MS					Core descriptions and the mineralogy of Holocene Mississippi River floodplain deposits in Louisiana provide insights on fluid migration pathways and the origin of iron-rich ground waters in the Mississippi River Alluvial Aquifer (MRAA). Vertical changes in the sedimentologic and pedologic characteristics of floodplain deposits near Ferriday, Louisiana, provide evidence for two stages of floodplain development and suggest that depositional processes and drainage conditions changed substantially during the Holocene. Depositional and pedogenic processes produced complex fluid migration pathways in the MRAA confining unit and also contributed to the formation of iron-rich ground waters. Lower Holocene deposits in the study area are older than similar to 5000 yrs BP and show evidence of crevassing, lacustrine delta building, and multi-channel stream deposition. These processes deposited thin and narrow sheet sands, which represent fluid migration pathways in the MRAA confining unit. Poor drainage conditions during this initial stage of floodplain development also favored the precipitation of authigenic siderite and pyrite in poorly-drained swamps and shallow lakes. The pyrite and siderite probably represent the source of iron-rich ground waters in the MRAA. Upper Holocene floodplain deposits are younger than similar to 5000 yrs BP and represent the transition to the present-day meandering regime of the Mississippi River near Ferriday. This second stage of floodplain development was accompanied by pedogenesis, which produced slickensides in clayey backswamp soils. The abundance of slickensides and the presence of the thin and narrow sheet sands indicates that fluid migration in the MRAA confining unit near Ferriday is greater than generally recognized. Seasonal water table fluctuations and the mixing of oxygenated meteoric and reduced ground waters cause iron oxide reduction and pyrite oxidation in backswamp settings, which releases iron into solution. The presence of high (up to 16 mg/l) dissolved iron concentrations in water wells that are screened beneath pyrite- and siderite-rich, muddy backswamp deposits near Ferriday, suggests that the distribution of fine-grained alluvium is a primary control on the presence of iron-rich waters in the MRAA. in contrast, water wells that are screened in sandy meander belt deposits, which lack abundant iron-bearing minerals, have low (less than 1 mg/l) concentrations of total dissolved iron. Studies of large floodplains such as the Mississippi River, highlight the importance of floodplain histories for evaluating geologic influences on water quality, developing proper floodplain land use strategies, and for improving our understanding of the environmental geology of floodplain systems.																			0013-7952					DEC 30	1996	45	1-4					417	432		10.1016/S0013-7952(96)00024-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0013-7952(96)00024-5													WOS:A1996WE89100022
J	Wang, LZ; Zimmer, K; Diedrich, P; Williams, S				Wang, LZ; Zimmer, K; Diedrich, P; Williams, S			The two-story rainbow trout fishery and its effect on the zooplankton community in a Minnesota lake	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												We studied the two-story rainbow trout fishery and its influence on zooplankton communities in Big Watab Lake, Minnesota, in 1993. The main trout diet components were Chironomidae (larvae and pupae) and Daphnia pulex > 1.3 mm (53 % and 37% dry weight, respectively). Smaller trout were more dependent on D. pulex. Trout consumption of large D. pulex peaked in May (50% of diet) and decreased dramatically as the season progressed (3% of diet in August), being replaced by Chironomidae. This size-selective predation influenced the mean size of D. pulex in the water column, with 3% > 1.3 mm in May and 64% > 1.3 mm in September. The change in trout diet was associated with changes in vertical distribution of trout (detected by sonar surveys) as the lake stratified in mid-June. By August, trout were restricted to the thermocline and Daphnia found refuge from predation at greater depths. Results from a creel survey showed Big Watab Lake is providing an excellent trout fishery. Trout stocked at 245+/-12 (2 SE) mm gained an average of 152 mm and 575 g after eight months in the lake. Angler return rates were 58% in number and 285% in weight for the first year. Estimated annual mortality was 32% for age 1 and 12% for age 2 and older trout. Estimated fishing pressure was 337 h/ha and catch rates were 0.27 and 0.18 fish/h in open water and ice fishing seasons, respectively.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				MAR	1996	11	1					67	80		10.1080/02705060.1996.9663495	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1996.9663495													WOS:A1996TX21900008

On 11 January 2021, an Mw 6.7 earthquake struck the center of this lake, providing a unique opportunity to better understand lake ice movement, ridge distribution, and hydraulic and hydrodynamic processes, as a result of the mainshock. We use a pixel-tracking method on both Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar and Sentinel-2 optical remote-sensing data covering this lake before, during and after the mainshock to obtain lake-ice displacement. Combining these measurements with different viewing geometries, we determine the locations of pressure ridges in each period and derive their relative 3D displacement maps with a precision of <2.2 m. Our results indicate a large E-W displacement of up to 10.3 m and a vertical displacement of up to 4.6 m during the coseismic period, which has a distinctly different magnitude and pattern of displacement compared to the pre- and post-event periods. Given the ice motion pattern and magnitude, we speculate that the unique ice displacement of Khovsgol Lake may have been caused by a rare seismic seiche after the mainshock.

The lake level was lower between about 6500 and 3500 yr B.P. indicating that runoff from the upper Yahara River basin may have ceased during the drier seasons of the year. Derived estimates of precipitation between 6500 and 3500 yr B.P. indicate a decrease of about 10% (down to about 700 mm) for the present precipitation value of 800 mm. A warming between 6500 and 3500 yr B.P. is also interpreted based on a change of vegetation from rich mesophytic forest before 6500 yr B.P. to Quercus savanna, with increased charcoal abundances after that time. After 3500 yr B.P., a closed Quercus forest and decreased charcoal suggest a cooler and wetter climate. The qualitative paleoecological interpretations, quantitative precipitation reconstructions based on pollen from the region (including the Lake Mendota data), and estimates of hydrologic budget based on lake-level changes, all show indications of a dry and warm middle Holocene. Evidence from a large regional array of sites also supports these interpretations.																			0033-5894	1096-0287				MAR	1986	25	2					235	250		10.1016/0033-5894(86)90060-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0033-5894(86)90060-8													WOS:A1986A590000009
J	Krall, JR; Keller, JP; Peng, RD				Krall, Jenna R.; Keller, Joshua P.; Peng, Roger D.			Assessing the health estimation capacity of air pollution exposure prediction models	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH												Background The era of big data has enabled sophisticated models to predict air pollution concentrations over space and time. Historically these models have been evaluated using overall metrics that measure how close predictions are to monitoring data. However, overall methods are not designed to distinguish error at timescales most relevant for epidemiologic studies, such as day-to-day errors that impact studies of short-term health associations. Methods We introduce frequency band model performance, which quantifies health estimation capacity of air quality prediction models for time series studies of air pollution and health. Frequency band model performance uses a discrete Fourier transform to evaluate prediction models at timescales of interest. We simulated fine particulate matter (PM2.5), with errors at timescales varying from acute to seasonal, and health time series data. To compare evaluation approaches, we use correlations and root mean squared error (RMSE). Additionally, we assess health estimation capacity through bias and RMSE in estimated health associations. We apply frequency band model performance to PM2.5 predictions at 17 monitors in 8 US cities. Results In simulations, frequency band model performance rates predictions better (lower RMSE, higher correlation) when there is no error at a particular timescale (e.g., acute) and worse when error is added to that timescale, compared to overall approaches. Further, frequency band model performance is more strongly associated (R-2 = 0.95) with health association bias compared to overall approaches (R-2 = 0.57). For PM2.5 predictions in Salt Lake City, UT, frequency band model performance better identifies acute error that may impact estimated short-term health associations. Conclusions For epidemiologic studies, frequency band model performance provides an improvement over existing approaches because it evaluates models at the timescale of interest and is more strongly associated with bias in estimated health associations. Evaluating prediction models at timescales relevant for health studies is critical to determining whether model error will impact estimated health associations.

J	PATERSON, MJ				PATERSON, MJ			INVERTEBRATE PREDATION AND THE SEASONAL DYNAMICS OF MICROCRUSTACEA IN THE LITTORAL-ZONE OF A FISHLESS LAKE	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The effects of invertebrate predation on seasonal changes in abundance, species composition, and sizes of microcrustacea were examined in the littoral zone of a fishless lake (Jack Lake). Observational studies revealed that most epiphytic, benthic, and zooplanktonic copepods had two generations during the ice-free season, with maximum numbers of adults in June-july and October-November. Densities of most species of Cladocera peaked in June-July and September-October, with low numbers in August. Qualitative examination of cladoceran birth rates suggested that seasonal abundance was most affected by changes in population loss rates. Similar data in other studies have been interpreted as evidence of seasonal changes in predation mortality. Further examination of predator-prey relationships in Jack Lake, however, failed to provide evidence that invertebrate predators strongly affected littoral microcrustacea. Gut content analyses and abundance estimates indicated that copepods, tanypod chironomids, odonates, and water mites were the most important predators of littoral microcrustacea. With the exception of instar-4 Ablabesmyia sp., seasonal changes in the densities of these predators were not negatively correlated with microcrustacean abundance. Manipulations of densities of large odonates, small odonates, tanypod chironomids, and adult water mites in enclosures provided no evidence of strong predator effects on microcrustacean community structure. Taken together, the observational and experimental data suggested that the seasonal dynamics of littoral microcrustacea were not strongly affected by invertebrate predators.

In this study, the pineal gland of the Lake Van fish was examined anatomically and histologically. The melatonin level secreted from the pineal gland was determined in fish plasma sampled from both lakes and streams during reproduction migration. The pineal gland in the Lake Van fish, as in other teleost fish, is located in the head, under the translucent pineal window, which does not contain many pigment cells. The gland consists of pineal vesicle and pineal stalk parts on the dorsal sac in the Lake Van fish. It was determined that the pineal gland showed good vascularity. The presence of pinealocytes and different types of cells in the pineal organ was determined histologically. Pinealocytes were intensely localized in the lumen of the pineal vesicle. The plasma melatonin level increased in fish passing from lake to stream for reproductive migration.					; oguz, ahmet/G-3672-2013	oguz, ahmet regaib/0000-0001-6431-0508; 													0340-2096	1439-0264				JUL	2022	51	4					427	434		10.1111/ahe.12802	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ahe.12802		MAR 2022						35285548					WOS:000769634700001
J	Daly, DC; Costa, DP; Melo, AWF				Daly, Douglas C.; Costa, Denise P.; Melo, Antonio Willian F.			The 'salao' vegetation of Southwestern Amazonia	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												This paper presents a first account of the salao vegetation of southwestern Amazonia, a frequent but poorly known formation and unusual in that it is a lowland moist tropical environment in which virtually all of the plant diversity is accounted for by herbs. The saloes occur along canalized portions of the Purus and Jurua river basins, and their substrates consist of exposed parent materials that characterize much of this sector of Amazonia but are usually overlain by a relatively thin (< 1 m) layer of soil. They are constantly moist seeps or 'seepage banks,' and the lower portions are seasonally submerged. Strata are recognizable in the vegetation, and the physiognomy and composition of each vegetation band of the saloes is likely determined by the slope, the parent material, and (for lower bands) the duration of flooding. To date the salao flora has registered 66 species: 11 bryophytes, 12 ferns, and 43 angiosperms. Five of the bryophyte species, two ferns, and one grass, Arundinella berteroniana, are found in most if not all saloes and can be considered indicators of this vegetation type, while most of the pteridophytes and other angiosperms occur more sporadically. None of the species is endemic to the formation and only four to the region; most are associated generally with the margins of rivers, lakes, and streams, often on rocky or sandy substrates. The floristic and conservation significance of this formation lie in its apparent affinities with montane regions, in the fact that 21 species and eight genera are recorded for the Acre flora only from the saloes, and in its local value as a source of filtered potable water.					; Melo, Antonio Willian Flores de/L-2415-2018; Costa, Denise/B-5727-2011; MELO, ANTONIO/HMW-1940-2023	costa, denise/0000-0001-9495-3029; Melo, Antonio Willian Flores de/0000-0003-0893-8602; 													0960-3115					AUG	2006	15	9					2905	2923		10.1007/s10531-005-3429-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-005-3429-x													WOS:000240722500004

Organic and siliceous protistan scales in north-cast Atlantic abyssal sediments	JOURNAL OF THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM												We report the occurrence of a high diversity of minute (similar to 1 mu m diameter) organic and siliceous protistan scales in small samples (total volume similar to 35 mu l) of superficial sediment from the Porcupine Abyssal Plain (PAP), north-east Atlantic (4850 in water depth). Many exhibit characters by which they can be identified to species. The organic scales belong to the haptophyte genera Chrysochromulina (8-9 species), Chrysocampanula and Dolichomastix (I species each). The siliceous scales belong to the chrysophytes Paraphysomonas vestita and Meringosphaera sp. and to the heterotrophic flagellate genus Thaumatomastix (T dybsoeana, T. formosa, Thaumatomastix sp.). As far as we are aware, this is the first time that non-calcareous protistan scales have been observed in deep-sea sediments (although siliceous skeletal plates and cysts are reported). All scales probably originated from the upper water column and were delivered to the deep-sea floor on rapidly sinking detrital aggregates. However, naked heterotrophic flagellates are known to thrive in abyssal sediment habitats and so the possibility that some scale-bearing protists also live in benthic deep-sea environments cannot be eliminated. Many species identified at the PAP site are common in coastal marine waters around Europe; some occur as far afield as Tasmania and New Zealand. Five Chrysochromulina species are known from central oceanic areas, including parts of the North Atlantic, while another species, C. pringsheimii, is reported from a British freshwater lake. We retrieved similar to 15% of the 55 named Chrysochromulina species (similar to 8% of the estimated total number of species in this diverse group) in the similar to 35 mu l of abyssal sediment. Because the scales can persist and be identified after cell death, they may provide useful time- and space-averaged information about the distribution of protist species in marine habitats. The long-term fate of the scales on the sea-floor is unknown. It is possible that at least some of the organic scales are preserved as microfossils in deep-sea sediments.

Yield and soil trends were evaluated along transect lines at increasing distances from individual trees in different orientations extending away from the tree canopy. Exploratory studies along the lakeshore plain of Lake Malawi during the 1987/1988 season showed that yields of local maize under traditional management with A. albida were more than double the yield away from the trees. However, the soil fertility status changed little over the length of the transects. Later studies were conducted inland from the lake with hybrid and local maize. Soil differences were again minimal. Hybrid maize (NSCM41 and R201 ) generally outyielded local maize, but the size and period of sampling were too limited for conclusive results, especially regarding crop sustainability. Overall yield patterns were similar to the lakeshore area, but differences were more variable. This appeared to be a function of variability in tree size and shape, soils, crop management by the farmer, and proximity to neighbouring trees. The relative contributions of these factors are not known, indicating areas for further research. Because of the on-farm nature of these trials, control over external influences was limited, suggesting the need to standardize cropping practices and other factors across sites if the mechanisms affecting yields are to be better understood.																			0378-1127					APR	1994	64	2-3					217	230		10.1016/0378-1127(94)90296-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0378-1127(94)90296-8													WOS:A1994NK89200014
J	GRAND, JB				GRAND, JB			NESTING SUCCESS OF DUCKS ON THE CENTRAL YUKON FLATS, ALASKA	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE												Nesting success was studied at Canvasback Lake and Mallard Lake on the Yukon Flats in interior Alaska in 1989-1991. Simple estimates of nesting success were computed using two techniques that assume a constant daily survival rate (DSR). Maximum-likelihood estimates of nesting success for all ducks, assuming constant DSR, ranged among years and sites from near zero to 12%. However, DSRs were not constant but increased with nest age and initiation date (R(2) = 0.42, P = 0.0001). Nesting success was near zero for nests initiated 1-10 May and increased to 100% for nests initiated after 30 June. Therefore, species nesting in early to mid season, such as Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), Northern Pintail (A. acuta), and Northern Shoveler (A. clypeata), had lower success than later nesting species such as Green-winged Teal (A. crecca) and Lesser Scaup (Aythya affinis). In 1990 and 1991, combined nesting success of all species, allowing for variation in DSR with nest initiation date and age of nest, was 12.50%.																			0008-4301					FEB	1995	73	2					260	265		10.1139/z95-030	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z95-030													WOS:A1995RC55500006

Comparative studies were done in the Amazon river water seasonally flooding the lake. Seasonal changes in specific conductance and the content Of Si, SO4, and NH4 in the lake were large. During the low water period (October to December) when the lake had receded to its minimum depth, specific conductance increased up to 14 times, Si up to 19 times, SO4 up to 23 times, and NH4 up to 29 times of the respective concentrations in the river water. During rising and high water level (January to September) specific conductance and concentrations Of Si, SO4, and NH4 in lake surface water were closely related to those of the river water during the same period. On the average, specific conductance was 56 %, concentration of Si 55 %, Of SO4 2 %, and Of NH4 0 % higher than in river water. PO4 concentrations in the lake during rising and high water level were about 17 % higher than those in the river water but did not show a marked rise at low water. Short term chemical stratification at high water was only pronounced for NH4 and PO4. The average concentrations in water near the bottom were 91 % and 112 %, respectively, higher than those of surface water. NO3 content in the lake was lower than in the river during the whole two year study period (24.2 +/- 35.8 mug N l-1 versus 101.5 +/- 43.9 mug N l-1); the lake acts as a sink for dissolved nitrate.

The former represents the number capable of coexisting at any one time, and the latter includes a seasonal or other temporal component. The relationship between the two varies mainly with salinity. Dominance is generally inversely related to diversity. In considering the total possible range of dominance for a given number of species the mean values are surprisingly restricted. An abnormally high dominance for a number of species can be an indication of pollution or some other form of environmental stress.																			0018-8158					APR 16	1993	255						345	352		10.1007/BF00025859	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00025859													WOS:A1993LD64400051

The main objective was to regionalize the Ethiopian Rift Valley Lakes Basin into homogenous sub-regions based on monthly and seasonal rainfalls and investigate the influence of some global climate drivers at the scale of the sub-regions to devise predictive tools. The dataset used monthly rainfall and global and regional climate indices anomalies from 1983 to 2014. Principal component analysis (PCA), Pearson correlation, and multivariate linear regression methods were applied using SPSS and R software. Based on PCA analysis, three principal components were identified which have a significant association with global climate indices. Over the study period, there were nine moderates to strong El Nino and six La Nina events; the warming phases received more rainfall and less in the cooling phase. Lagged sea surface temperature (SST) and atmospheric variables were selected as predictors based on significant associations with regional rainfall. The multiple linear regression analysis revealed the possibilities of deriving seasonal forecasts at the local level. The study showed that the model derived an excellent and scientifically robust seasonal rainfall prediction skill in a short lead time of the different seasons at a range of 30 to 80% in the sub-regional level. The capabilities of rainfall prediction skills help reduce climate-induced hazards in planning and decision-making processes by providing timely and specific climate information.

Therefore, before being able to detail their role, digenean species' identification and the diversity present in the ecosystems must be known. In this study, the diversity and the temporal-spatial dynamics of larval digeneans in the freshwater snail Heleobia parchappii were analysed in a shallow lake. Specimens of H. parchappii were collected seasonally at three points during one year and a total of 2871 molluscs were analysed. A total of 23 species of digenea were registered and both the overall prevalence and the composition of the assemblages presented temporal and spatial variations, responding to the differential environmental conditions characteristics (anthropic effect, presence of native forests, and differential use of the habitat by the definitive hosts) of three sampled sites. The assemblages of larval digenean in their first intermediate host support the idea that this area is of great importance in biodiversity, and could be endemic areas of some species of digenean that use reptiles, amphibians and bats as hosts, groups that are at risk of conservation. Protection of these environments is a fundamental pillar in the policies for the conservation of wild flora and fauna.																			0031-1820	1469-8161				MAR	2022	149	3					347	355		10.1017/S0031182021001888	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0031182021001888								35264266					WOS:000766556500008

During a 4-year study, which encompassed a change from phytoplankton to macrophyte dominance, there was a large decline in phytoplankton biomass and production, and an increase in macrophyte biomass. However, there was little increase in the macrophyte production, and the total primary production of the lake declined sharply, by a factor of 4. The effects of phytoplankton having better access to the available light and a longer growing season, and the more rapid nutrient cycling expected among planktonic communities, clearly outweighed those of macrophytes having access to sediment nutrients in this lake. Grazing by black swans was calculated to have removed about 15-25% of the production of macrophytes during their growing season, or 20-50% per annum.																			0304-3770	1879-1522				MAR	1989	33	1-2					101	110		10.1016/0304-3770(89)90023-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(89)90023-5													WOS:A1989U245300008
J	KAUP, E				KAUP, E			ANNUAL PRIMARY PRODUCTION OF PHYTOPLANKTON IN LAKE VERKHNEYE, SCHIRMACHER OASIS, ANTARCTICA	POLAR BIOLOGY												Algal carbon 14 fixation, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), temperature and nutrients were measured from March 1976 to January 1977 and from November 1983 to February 1984 in a small freshwater lake. As a consequence of the minute meltwater input, the PAR extinction coefficient was very low ranging between 0.04 and 0.12 m-1 throughout the year. Low extinction combined with the transparent and mostly snowless ice cover resulted in high noon PAR intensities of 640-2340 muE m-2 s-1 in the lake from November to January. As a result of the small annual total phosphorus loading (0.01 mmol m-3 of lake), phosphate concentration in the main water mass did not exceed 0.03 mmol m-3 during most of the growing season. Phytoplankton assimilation rates were very low with a minimum of 0.03 mgC (mgChl a)-1h-1 in December. The annual net primary production was 0.58 gC m-2, the lowest value on record. These low levels were due to photoinhibition and phosphorus limitation.																			0722-4060					OCT	1994	14	7					433	439																WOS:A1994PL96200001
J	Hann, BJ; Turner, MA				Hann, BJ; Turner, MA			Exploitation by microcrustacea of a new littoral habitat in an acidified lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Extensive growths of filamentous green algae (metaphyton) developed at pH 4.5 in the littoral zone of Lake 302S and dense populations of microcrustacean grazers occupied this new habitat. Microcrustacean community composition in this metaphyton consisted predominantly of cladocerans (e.g. Chydorus piger, Acantholeberis curvirostris, Alona intermedia, A. rustica, Acroperus cf. harpae and Simocephalus serrulatus), as well as substantially fewer copepods, including Macrocyclops albidus and Eucyclops agilis. Despite the development of this new littoral habitat, the metaphyton-associated microcrustacea were relatively homogeneous throughout the littoral zone in terms of composition, species richness and diversity, which varied little among any of the benthic habitats (macrophytes, sediments, boulders, metaphyton). Cladoceran and copepod density varied seasonally and synchronously in all habitats with highest densities occurring in June-July and September. Densities were much higher in metaphyton than in other littoral habitats.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				DEC	1999	416						65	75		10.1023/A:1003894511586	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003894511586													WOS:000085130100006
J	VANT, WN				VANT, WN			CAUSES OF LIGHT ATTENUATION IN 9 NEW-ZEALAND ESTUARIES	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Optical properties and the constituent composition of the waters of nine northern New Zealand estuaries were determined during 1988-89. Substantial variation was found both within and between the estuaries. For characteristics such as beam attenuation, turbidity and suspended solids, sources of variation in particular estuaries included: state of the tide (causing three-fold differences); seasonal changes (five to ten-fold); incomplete mixing, both horizontal (two to three-fold) and, in one case, vertical (about two-fold); and the presence of floodwaters (at least five-fold). The waters at the estuary mouths were fairly turbid (Secchi depths 1.2 - 4.4 m), and were comparatively bright (PAR reflectance 6-12%), because the constituents tended to scatter more light than they absorbed (7-17 times more on average). Phytoplankton biomass was low (chlorophyll a, 0.5-5 mg m-3) and suspended particulates were mostly inorganic (82%). Equations were derived which described how the water constituents affected the estuaries'' optical properties. Reasonably reliable predictions resulted when the equations were tested against a separate data set. The inorganic suspensoids (3-11 g m-3) caused 56% of beam attenuation, four times that caused by phytoplankton. Scattering per unit mass of suspensoids was several times lower than that found in some New Zealand lakes because of the larger average particle size of the estuarine material. Oxidation pond effluent discharged to one of the estuaries had little effect on beam attenuation there.																			0272-7714	1096-0015				AUG	1990	31	2					125	137		10.1016/0272-7714(90)90042-P	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0272-7714(90)90042-P													WOS:A1990EF24300002

We compared two commonly used methods for interpolating chemistry data (time-averaging and flow-weighting) to determine whether discrepancies between the two methods were large relative to other sources of error in estimating flux rates. Flux rates of dissolved Si and SO42- were calculated from 10 years of data (1981-1990) for the NW inlet and outlet of Mirror Lake and for a 40-day period (March 22 to April 30, 1993) during which we augmented our routine (weekly) chemical monitoring with collection of daily samples. The time-averaging method yielded higher estimates of solute flux during high-flow periods if no chemistry samples were collected corresponding to peak discharge. Concentration-discharge relationships should be used to interpolate stream chemistry during changing flow conditions if chemical changes are large. Caution should be used in choosing the appropriate time-scale over which data are pooled to derive the concentration-discharge regressions because the model parameters (slope and intercept) were found to be sensitive to seasonal and inter-annual variation. Both methods approximated solute flux to within 2-10 % for a range of solutes that were monitored during the intensive sampling period. Our results suggest that errors arising from interpolation of stream chemistry data are small compared with other sources of error in developing watershed mass balances.

Seasonal patterns in lipid production and the photosynthetic parameters describing lipid production in Lake Schohsee (a small freshwater mono-dimictic and moderately eutrophic North German Baltic lake) were determined. 2. The mean Lipid fraction of C fixation (LIP-FCF) was 13.2% (range 7.6-21%), measured bimonthly from January to December 1995. Periods of high nutrient concentration, low temperatures and particular species of algae (diatoms and/or cryptophytes), were associated with the highest LIP-FCF values. 3. None of the static indicators of nutrient status [dissolved nitrate, soluble reactive silica (SRS); C/N or N/P] are apparently related to the allocation of carbon to lipid in Lake Schohsee. 4. The light saturation parameters (I-k:I-k-LIP) indicated that carbon fixation into lipid was saturated at much lower light than that of total carbon fixation. This suggested that carbon fixation into lipid was more light efficient than total carbon fixation. 5. The relative allocation of carbohydrate and protein was related to daylength and temperature, respectively.

J	BOLGRIEN, DW; BROOKS, AS				BOLGRIEN, DW; BROOKS, AS			ANALYSIS OF THERMAL FEATURES OF LAKE-MICHIGAN FROM AVHRR SATELLITE IMAGES	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The seasonal dynamics of thermal features in Lake Michigan were studied using numerous sea surface temperature images acquired from the NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer from May-December, 1990. In southern Lake Michigan, the vernal thermal front moved offshore and to the north between 7 May 1990 and 11 June 1990. Inshore of the front, surface temperatures were > 10.0-degrees-C while offshore surface temperatures remained < 4.5-degrees-C. In northern Lake Michigan, thermal fronts were not prevalent until late June. Southern Green Bay consistently contained the warmest water in Lake Michigan and exceeded 15.0-degrees-C in May. Warm bay-water frequently mixed with cooler lake-water through the channels at the north end of the bay. Warm water plumes remained intact for several days with S/SW winds but were quickly obliterated by a N/NE wind. Upwelling was most conspicuous along the eastern shore of the lake. Depending on wind direction, upwelled water formed broad continuous nearshore bands or isolated patches of relatively cold water. Evidence of upwelling 1-3 days after the instigating wind event suggested oscillations of internal waves. Our study shows that the frequent acquisition of satellite images is useful to describe significant thermal features in a large lake.																			0380-1330						1992	18	2					259	266		10.1016/S0380-1330(92)71293-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(92)71293-3													WOS:A1992HY69800002

Extinct groundwater discharge locality in the Eldorado Valley; eastern Mojave Desert, Nevada, USA	JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY ENVIRONMENTS												Dry lakes are common environmental matrixes of hydrographically closed (endorheic) valleys in western North America's deserts. Groundwater discharge localities that form in arid regions are excellent data sources, recording hydrological responses to regional and global climate changes. This research brings geomorphic, geochemical, and stratigraphic evidence from a paleo-age groundwater discharge locality in the Eldorado Valley of extreme southern Nevada, U.S.A. Sediments and stratigraphy suggest that a dynamic groundwater discharge complex formed in response to wet and dry climate cycling within the Eldorado Valley. This groundwater discharge locality was likely present on an annual to decadal scale, fed by groundwater rather than river sources, justifying the higher metal concentrations in deeper sediment layers. The C-14 dating further indicate this system was actively cycling between 13.9 and 4.88 ka cal yrs BP. Thermal regimes of warm-seasonal precipitation anomalies during the late Pleistocene to Holocene provided ideal conditions for a dynamic ecosystem due to a groundwater discharge locality located at the Eldorado Dry Playa.																			2662-5571	2447-9462				JUN	2022	7	2					175	198		10.1007/s43217-022-00093-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s43217-022-00093-8		FEB 2022											WOS:000757715100001

Correlations of environmental variables with the ordination were calculated and the importance of seasonality and geomorphology of the wetlands were investigated. The wetlands were also classified and ordinated using the chemical data. Analysis of variance was used to compare species richness, abundances of all invertebrates, macro-invertebrates, copepods and total phosphorus levels among groups. Six groups of wetlands were identified from the invertebrate data, two of which were outliers on the basis of very low pH and high salinity, respectively. The majority of the wetlands grouped on the basis of their degree of nutrient enrichment and colour. The analyses of chemical data gave similar groups. The coloured wetlands and least nutrient enriched non-coloured wetlands were identified as being closest to the probable state of wetlands prior to European settlement. The greatest numbers of rare species were found in wetlands from these two groups. Species richness was significantly higher in the moderately enriched wetlands than in any other group but decreased in the most enriched wetlands where abundances of invertebrates were highest. Changes in community composition among the groups of wetlands are discussed. The most highly nutrient enriched wetlands were dominated by cosmopolitan species with high abundances, whereas less enriched and coloured wetlands had species with more restricted distributions and lower abundances.

Seasonal variation of total and biochemically available concentrations of PAHs in a floodplain lake sediment has no effect on the benthic invertebrate community	CHEMOSPHERE												Floodplain areas in the Netherlands are moderately to heavily contaminated with trace metals and organic contaminants. The impact of this sediment pollution on benthic invertebrates is best described with so-called 'bioavailable' concentrations instead of total concentrations. Studies into the effect of contaminants on biota are usually a snapshot in time, with one or two samples in a year. In such studies, effect of seasonal variation cannot be detected. Objective of this study was to investigate the temporal variation of sediment PAH contamination in one floodplain lake, and possible consequences for the benthic invertebrate community. This was done by sampling biota, abiotic variables and sediment contaminants every four weeks during one year. We observed a limited seasonal variation in total and bioavailable concentrations of PAHs. Multivariate analysis revealed that the PAH contamination is not a significant factor for the benthic invertebrate community in this floodplain lake. Bioavailable concentrations of PAHs were low and no effects could be expected based on the measured values. No increase of available PAHs was observed in periods where conditions for degradation were absent (low temperature, anaerobic). These results also indicate that in such floodplain lake systems, with historical pollution, the timing of sampling to assess sediment contamination with organic pollutants is of limited importance. This can be useful for planning sampling in risk assessment studies. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The Effects of Fertilization and Time of Cutting on Regeneration and Seed Production of Dipsacus laciniatus (Dipsacacae)	NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL												We studied effects of fertilization and time of cutting on the regeneration of cutleaf teasel (Dipsacus laciniatus L.) at the Mascoutin Recreation Area at Clinton Lake, Dewitt County, Illinois, for two growing seasons. D. laciniatus is an exotic European invasive species that infests natural habitats across much of the United States and southern Canada. We established fourteen 5.0-m x 5.0-m paired plots, seven fertilized and seven unfertilized. Each set of paired plots was assigned one of seven cutting treatments, including no cutting, or one of six cutting times from 3 June to 10 August 2002. We measured stem height, number of heads per individual plant, number of seeds per head, and seed viability. We found no significant difference between plant heights or number of heads per individual in fertilized versus unfertilized plots. Reproductive success significantly increased when D. laciniatus had more time to grow after cutting. If cutting occurred before flower buds opened in early July, no significant difference in number of heads produced was found between cut and uncut D. laciniatus. If cutting occurred after flowers developed. then the stalk height, number of heads, seeds produced per plant, and total number of viable seeds all significantly decreased. Therefore, it appears that mowing areas containing cutleaf teasel in the Midwest may be an effective control, but only if performed after rosettes have committed to bolting, before seeds are viable, and late enough in the growing season to prevent reproductive regrowth.																			0885-8608	2162-4399				APR	2009	29	2					140	145		10.3375/043.029.0206	http://dx.doi.org/10.3375/043.029.0206													WOS:000265563000006

We examined the seasonal cycle of seawater adaptability in a landlocked (10 000 years) population of kokanee, Oncorhynchus nerka, to determine if the typical anadromous cycle persists in the absence of recent gene flow from sockeye salmon, as would be expected if components of smoltification are beneficial to a lacustrine existence. We also monitored the effects of maturation on seawater adaptability, to determine if they had an inhibitory effect on smoltification, as would be expected if a developmental conflict was responsible for the evolution of nonanadromous forms. Maturation was measured through the growth of gonadal tissue and the increase in circulating testosterone and 11-ketotestosterone. Landlocked kokanee showed the seawater adaptability cycle typical of sockeye salmon, and maturation had no inhibitory effect on seawater adaptability until near, or at, full maturity. We conclude that at least some components of smoltification must be beneficial to a life in lakes to account for the continued maintenance of the cycle. Further, rapid development and maturation on their own do not appear to account for the evolution of nonanadromous populations of O. nerka.																			0008-4301					MAR	1994	72	3					397	405		10.1139/z94-056	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z94-056													WOS:A1994NW99000003

Over a period of 12 months, 549 brown trout were caught from two lakes, Lough Feeagh and Bunaveela Lake, in the Burrishoole River system, Co. Mayo, Ireland. The parasite component community was dominated by a single species, P. laevis. Fifty eight percent of the trout sample were infected with the acanthocephalan and the mean abundance (+/- SD) was 3.1 +/- 5.1. The relationships between the prevalence and abundance of P. laevis and season and site of host capture and host age and sex were explored. As single factors none of these parameters emerged as significant contributors to changes in parasite abundance although some interaction terms proved to the significant. A random sample of over 700 P. laevis parasites were subjected to further investigation and their size, position in the intestine and maturity status are described. Parasites attained an average weight of 7 mg and occupied the posteriad positions within the fish intestine (77%). Parasites from this sample of Irish brown trout attained a similar average size to those found in chub and barbel from England. 42.3% of the total parasites examined contained ovarian balls only and 17% contained fully mature acanthors. Therefore only a moderate proportion of female worms contained mature acanthors in these trout whereas the majority of worms recovered from a sample of chub were gravid. Utilizing a logistic regression model, parasite size, season, and site of host capture emerged as particularly significant factors which contribute to whether a parasite contains mature eggs.																			0022-149X	1475-2697				SEP	1995	69	3					229	235		10.1017/S0022149X00014188	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022149X00014188								8522766					WOS:A1995TC96400007

Across three seasons sampled, fish and aquatic insects were common foods for M. dolomieu; the most frequently occurring forage items were Osteichthyes. The mean radiocesium concentration in M. dolomieu muscle was 582 Bq kg(-1) wet weight, and the concentrations in different categories of stomach contents ranged from 297 to 811 Bq kg(-1) wet weight. Considering the radiocesium concentrations in the lake water and in plankton (which included some particulate organic matter), it was possible that M. dolomieu radiocesium contamination is mainly transferred via the food chain. A positive correlation existed between M. dolomieu standard length and radiocesium concentration. However, in M. dolomieu of the same size range, the concentrations did not differ significantly between fish that existed at the time of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident and those born afterward. Although some fish sampled in 2014 were highly contaminated, the initial Fukushima fallout does not necessarily explain the high radiocesium concentrations in some M. dolomieu in the lake several years after the accident. The contamination levels observed in M. dolomieu might result from radiocesium concentrations in their available food at any time, whether immediately or several years after the Fukushima accident.																			0919-9268	1444-2906				MAR	2022	88	2					329	336		10.1007/s12562-022-01585-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12562-022-01585-2		FEB 2022											WOS:000749952400001

Technique for suppression of background cascades produced by atmospheric muon bundles in the Baikal-GVD	JOURNAL OF INSTRUMENTATION					Conference on Very Large Volume Neutrino Telescope	MAY 18-21, 2021	Valencia, SPAIN					Baikal-GVD (Gigaton Volume Detector) is a neutrino telescope located in pure water of Lake Baikal. At the current stage (season 2021), detector is composed of 2304 optical modules arranged in 8 clusters. In searching for neutrino cascade events, light patterns produced via discrete stochastic energy losses along muon tracks create the most abundant background. Methods to separate cascade-like events from tracks and neutrino cascades in a single cluster have been developed and optimized. One of the method tries to find the maximum number of track hits amongst cascade hits, which are present in the muon bundle event. Other ones rely on the distributions of charges and positions of hits on optical modules associated with cascade events. All suppression methods were optimized by the Monte Carlo simulation datasets.

We found that there was a large variety and low constancy of ciliate plankton and a clear advantage of several small species. Balanion plancton-icum, Rimostrombidium brachykinetum, and Urotricha farcta contributed 19.7%, 13.4%, and 10.7% to the total abundance, respectively. The ciliate community was significantly varied in different lake regions of different eutrophication levels, and the distribution of some of the main species, especially prostomatids and scuticociliatids, might be closely related to the nutrient level of the lake regions. The seasonal dynamics of ciliate taxa with similar functional feeding habits across regions at different trophic levels are more convergent than those of species with very different functions, and the top-down effect (clado-cerans, rotifers), nutrition, and water temperature were the key factors shaping ciliate community structure. The results of this study accentuate the important effects of species functional diversity on community differences and may improve our knowledge of ciliate diversity and functional ecology in shallow eutrophic lakes.(c) 2021 Published by Elsevier GmbH.

Methodological Approaches and Results of an Analysis of the Climatic Seasonal Course of Stable Stratification Parameters of a Dimictic Lake (Case Study of the Central Part of Lake Ladoga)	IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS												On the basis of general physical concepts of the thermic of a dimictic lake and the proposed methodological developments, the average climatic course of the parameters of the thermocline during the period of stable stratification for the central part of Lake Ladoga is reproduced. We consider the joint distribution of the seasonal variation of the water surface temperature; the temperature of the mixed layer, which differs by no more than 0.5 degrees C; and the deepening of the upper boundary of the thermocline, the depth of the maximum density gradient, and the depth of the lower boundary of the thermocline, which characterize their climatic course. Statistical analysis of vertical temperature profiles measured over a long period of time from 1897 to 2017 made it possible for the first time to develop empirical quantitative relationships between stratification parameters with high determination coefficients. Based on the difference in the physical characteristics of the processes of heating and cooling of the lake surface, useful regression relationships were found for each of the periods which describe the seasonal variation of the thermal parameters of Lake Ladoga. The rates of change in water temperature and change in the parameters of the thermocline are estimated. The forms of the proposed approximation dependences can be used to study the thermic of other dimictic lakes.

J	Mattson, MD; Godfrey, PJ; Walk, MF; Kerr, PA; Zajicek, OT				Mattson, MD; Godfrey, PJ; Walk, MF; Kerr, PA; Zajicek, OT			Evidence of recovery from acidification in Massachusetts streams	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												A ten year survey of water quality in 330 Massachusetts streams was conducted to examine the rate and pattern of recovery from acidification. Meta-analysis was used to combine the results of the 330 non-parametric trend tests into an overall test for trend in a variety of water quality variables including pH, acid neutralizing capacity (ANC), and major inorganic ions. Analysis of trends in the raw data indicates both pH and ANC are increasing. After detrending for variations in stream runoff, we estimate the streams are recovering from acidification at a rate of +0.021 pH units/year and +2.4 mu eq/L/year, for pH and ANC respectively. These trends appear to be related to declines in sulfate (-1.8 mu eq/L/year), while base cation trends were mixed. Meta-analysis reveals the trends are not always homogeneous between seasons or between sites. While it is commonly assumed that the low ANC systems are most 'sensitive' to changes in acid or base inputs, we found the greatest rates of change in ANC were associated with the high ANC systems. The greatest increases in pH were seen in the low ANC streams as expected. The results also suggest streams respond quickly to changes in precipitation inputs and stream monitoring networks may be valuable as an early detection technique for changes in environmental quality.																			0049-6979					MAY	1997	96	1-4					211	232		10.1023/A:1026454104222	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1026454104222													WOS:A1997XJ62100014

The seasonal water storage variations for the plain lake group in the Yangtze-Huai River Basin (YHRB) are significant for alleviating flood pressure and regulating runoff. However, to date, the seasonal amplitude of lake water storage variations and its capacity of buffering floodwater in the YHRB is not quantified well and remains to be investigated comprehensively. To advance the understanding of such a critical scientific issue, the water level data of the plain lake group (area>100 km(2), 29 lakes) in the YHRB is collected from multi-source data between 1990 and 2020. Using lake inundation area obtained from Global Surface Water and water level variations, water storage dynamics for the plain lake group are quantified. Furthermore, this study also uses the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) products to analyze the terrestrial water storage anomalies (TWSA) in the whole basin. The results indicate that the seasonal amplitude of water level change and water storage variation of the plain lake group are 2.80 +/- 0.71 m and 37.38 +/- 14.19 Gt, respectively. Poyang and Dongting Lakes, two lakes that maintain the natural connection with the Yangtze River, have the most substantial seasonal amplitude in the hydrological situation. The amplitude in water level and water storage in Poyang Lake is 9.53 +/- 2.02 m and 14.13 +/- 5.54 Gt respectively, and that in Dongting Lake is 7.39 +/- 1.29 m and 7.31 +/- 3.42 Gt respectively. The contribution of seasonal variation of water storage for large plain lakes to TWSA in the YHRB is approximately 33.25%, fully reflecting these lake's imperative position in the YHRB. This study is expected to enhance the scientific understanding of the seasonal hydrologic regime for the large lakes in the YHRB and contribute to the management of flood risks and water resources in East China.					; Liu, Kai/HWQ-3608-2023	Liu, Kai/0000-0002-5500-0644; 														2296-665X				JAN 26	2022	10								838883	10.3389/fenvs.2022.838883	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2022.838883													WOS:000752920000001

FOLIA ZOOLOGICA												Males of SL 11 - 23 cm (2 - 4 years old) and females of 17 - 23 cm SL (3 - 4 years old) considered as precocious ''intermedius'' were most abundant among barbs of different morphotypes which spawned in tributaries of Lake Tana in September November 1994. The spawning took place in gravel riffles beginning soon after the sunset. Eggs were laid into the upper layer of the bottom substrate. The same spawning sites were repeatedly used by many spawners; density of eggs and larvae in the substrate at the spawning grounds reached 1000 per m(2). Water temperature at the spawning grounds varied between 18.5 and 23 degrees C. The average fecundity of the small (precocious) and big (normal) ''intermedius'' was 4.6 and 11.7 thousand eggs, respectively. Eggs developed for 4 days before hatching (at 18-20 degrees). Artificial crosses of precocious ''intermedius'' with several other morphotypes of large Tana barbs were successful, producing normally developing embryos and viable fry (at least up to 1 month old) thus indicating the absence of post-mating reproductive isolation between these morhpotypes. Precocious ''intermedius'' differed in external and cranial characters both from immature ''intermedius'' of their size caught in the lake and from normal ''intermedius'' (SL>23 cm) caught spawning in the rivers. We suggest that after the first spawning the precocious barbs skip one spawning season living in the lake and turning into big (normal)''intermedius'' which acquire with age characters of ''carp-like'' morphotype.

Ramets of Vallisneria americana were sampled from natural populations at 243 sites in the Huron-Erie corridor in August 1993, and an index of leaf-to-root surface area ratios was determined Sites were then ranked according to this index. Site rankings based on leaf-to-root surface area ratios were significantly correlated with the ranks of these sires using levels of organochlorine contamination of biota or sediment, reported independently in the published literature. The ratio of leaf-to-root surface areas ranged from 2 to 92, and higher values were found in more polluted sites. At four sires, plants were sampled monthly over one growing season, while at two sites plants were sampled each year for 4 years. The leaf-to-root surface area ratio changed little from year to year. At highly polluted sites there was a progressive increase in ratio over the growing season. Surveyed sites remained in the same relative ranking over the growing season, and a single survey within the same month could compare sites reliably. These results demonstrate that a very simple measure of ratios of leaf-to-root surface areas in Vallisneria may provide a rapid, sensitive, convenient and inexpensive metric of site quality from the perspective of macrophytes and organochlorine contamination. This could be used to prioritize sites for remedial action, and could confirm environmental improvement following remediation.																			0380-1330						1996	22	2					289	303		10.1016/S0380-1330(96)70956-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(96)70956-5													WOS:A1996VC21200014

J	Crapper, PF; Fleming, PM; Kalma, JD				Crapper, PF; Fleming, PM; Kalma, JD			Prediction of lake levels using water balance models	ENVIRONMENTAL SOFTWARE												Simple water balance models can be used to predict excess water and when the depth-volume relationship for a lake is known, these models can be used to predict variations in lake level. In the lake Goran study area annual rainfalls have varied significantly. The straight line of best fit shows a very slow increase over 116 years. An examination of the seasonal distribution of the rainfall reveals significant changes over that period. The October to December and the January to March quarters have shown significant reductions and subsequent increases during the recording period. In the early 1990s the April to June rainfalls have shown a significant increase and, coupled with comparatively low evaporation and transpiration at that time of the year, this has lead to significant increases in runoff. The excess water has been determined using a WATBAL type model for the current land-use distribution. The depth of the lake has been modelled using rainfall and excess water as inputs and evaporation as output. Given the simplicity of the model the agreement between measured and predicted lake levels is very good.

Four different light conditions were created in an experimental setup by manipulating the photon flux density using artificial shading (three levels of artificial shading and one control situation without artificial shading), during the growing season of 1986. During the growing season of 1987, part of the P. pectinatus vegetation in the experimental setup was artificially shaded in the same way as in 1986, while another part was not shaded. No artificial shading was applied at all during the growing season of 1988. Growth conditions for P. pectinatus were less favourable in 1987 than in 1986. On the whole, above- and below-ground biomass values were lower, the growing season was shorter, maximum above-ground biomass was lower and was reached earlier in the season, and net tuber production was lower in 1987 than in 1986 in the control situations. In both years, the above- and below-ground biomass values were lower, the growing season was shorter and maximum above-ground biomass was lower with higher levels of shading. The impact of shading on relative above-ground biomass development was similar in 1986 and 1987, whereas the impact of shading on relative tuber bank size at maximum above-ground biomass was more pronounced in 1987 than in 1986 in the experimental areas which were shaded both seasons. Mean individual tuber ash-free dry weight was lowest at the highest level of shading in both years. It is concluded that light climate is a dominant factor in controlling the biomass and tuber bank dynamics of a P. pectinatus population in Lake Veluwe. Additionally, water quality and meteorological characteristics are involved. At the highest level of shading, the photosynthetic tissue was able to sustain tuber growth and maintenance of the vegetation during a relatively short period only. As a consequence, the vegetation sloughed early in the growing season and the tuber bank size was smallest. The maximum above-ground biomass was positively correlated with the size of the hibernated tuber bank. Therefore, the biomass development in one season is at least partly determined by the light conditions of a previous growing season(s) through the size of the hibernated tuber bank. The Lake Veluwe vegetation has the potential to recuperate from negative shading effects on above-ground biomass and tuber bank size under field conditions. This may require more than one growing season. depending on actual growth conditions and size of the hibernated tuber bank.																			0304-3770					JUN	1992	43	1					17	41		10.1016/0304-3770(92)90011-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(92)90011-7													WOS:A1992JD98700002

Although total fish abundance differed significantly across seasons, only one common species (Dorosoma cepedianum) exhibited significant seasonal movements into or out of the littoral zone. Overall littoral-zone assemblage structure (based on rank order of species abundance) was concordant across seasons and habitat types, (vegetation, wood, open). However, within individual seasons and habitat types, assemblage structure was likely influenced by temporal and spatial differences in habitat availability and physicochemical conditions. Associations characteristic of species in natural aquatic environments were not well developed among species in this artificial, evolutionarily short-lived reservoir assemblage. Conditions related to water-level fluctuation appeared to deter the formation of persistent species associations and assemblage structure, especially in vegetation and open littoral zone habitats of this multi-purpose reservoir.																			0378-1909	1573-5133				FEB	1990	27	2					107	120		10.1007/BF00001940	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00001940													WOS:A1990CP63300003

Use of power analysis to determine the number of samples needed to assess water quality in lakes and flowing waters	INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT												The Clean Water Act requires states to develop methods for assessing water quality. Assessment methods serve as decision-making procedures for including waterbodies on the Section 303(d) List of Impaired Waters. We used 17 years of ambient water quality data to explore statistical analyses for assessment methods that represent New York's waterbodies. Power analyses were performed to determine how many samples are needed to evaluate exceedances of water quality criteria using one-sample t-tests in lakes and flowing waters. Results suggest six samples for lakes and eight samples for flowing waters are needed to obtain at least 80% power, which is fewer samples than most other types of statistical assessment methodologies. This smaller number was possible because the power analysis was applied to the actual variability found in monitoring data to calculate the effect size as opposed to more conservative statistical estimates based on random data. Water quality criteria can have different analysis requirements such as single samples or means above the threshold, so we compared how many impairments would occur in the dataset if the six or eight samples were assessed as two single exceedances or a mean above the water quality criteria. Because the power analysis gives no indication of the time frame of when samples should be collected, the intra- and interannual variability of the data was assessed to determine whether sampling over a growing season in one year or sampling over multiple years is more representative of the water quality status. Results demonstrated that data collected over the growing season captured more variability in water quality data than data collected over multiple years in both waterbody types. With the prevalence of regulatory agencies having large, historical datasets rising, it would be possible for other agencies to apply these types of analyses to their assessment methodologies.

J	DAVID, PG				DAVID, PG			WADING BIRD USE OF LAKE OKEECHOBEE RELATIVE TO FLUCTUATING WATER LEVELS	WILSON BULLETIN												We surveyed the Lake Okeechobee littoral zone by helicopter between 1977 and 1988 to determine wading bird abundance relative to lake water levels. More birds foraged when nesting season (January-July) water levels were below 4.4 m (mean sea level) compared to higher lake levels. Wading birds were also more abundant when nesting season water levels declined by at least 30 cm over the previous two-month period in comparison to more gradual declines or increases in lake levels. Lake levels and change in lake levels over the previous two-month period explained 60% of variation in wading bird abundance. Nesting effort did not appear to be affected by changes in water levels. However, fewer nesting attempts were observed when lake levels were above 4.9 m or below 3.9 m. Peak numbers of nesting wading birds occurred in April and May when lake levels were between 3.9 m and 4.4 m. In general, nesting effort declined during the survey period from over 6000 nests in 1977 and 1978 to between 725 and 1812 nests during the last five years of the study. One possible explanation for this decline is the impact of higher water levels due to increased rainfall and a change in the Lake Okeechobee regulation schedule. Higher water level reduced the foraging area available to nesting birds and may have contributed to the deterioration of nesting sites comprised of willows.																			0043-5643					DEC	1994	106	4					719	732																WOS:A1994PZ52400011

J.; Prat, Narcis			Habitat expansion of a tropical chironomid by seasonal alternation in use of littoral and profundal zones	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												The consistent warming of tropical lakes at all depths causes rapid development and long persistence of seasonal anoxia in the hypolimnion, which greatly reduces the biodiversity of hypolimnetic benthic invertebrates. Full mixing of the water column in a typically annual cool-season creates a benthic habitat suitable for invertebrates but offers little time for colonization before the return of anoxia. In Lake Alchichica, Mexico, the endemic midge Chironomus alchichica has evolved a life cycle consisting of reproduction in waters of the littoral zone, which is suboptimal for development, followed by colonization of the hypolimnetic benthic zone during its oxic phase. As shown by the sampling of both littoral and benthic habitats over an annual cycle, the development of Ch. alchichica in the profundal zone is favoured by minimal competition (only one other invertebrate species present) and no significant predation. The rapid maturation of the midge leads to a high density of pupation before the seasonal anoxia.					; Oseguera, Luis/AAV-2739-2021; Alcocer, Javier/S-7672-2019; Prat, Narcis/D-4405-2014	Alcocer, Javier/0000-0002-0535-7936; LEWIS, WILLIAM/0000-0002-9465-240X; Oseguera Perez, Luis Alberto/0000-0001-8405-9656; Prat, Narcis/0000-0002-1550-1305													1129-5767	1723-8633					2022	81	1							2055	10.4081/jlimnol.2022.2055	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2022.2055													WOS:000869459300010

Moreover, global warming causes a drastic change on the biodiversity of rivers, seas, lakes, including in biodiversity hotspots and protected areas, such as the Venice Lagoon in Italy. A similar impact is caused by pollutants: this called for a large-scale long-term action that aims to monitor aquatic environmental parameters in order to predict, manage and mitigate these effects. Yet, coastal systems are highly heterogeneous in space and variable over short (daily), medium and long (seasonal, inter-annual) timescales, making reliable but affordable monitoring a challenging task. This paper proposes to automate this process with the use of a low-power sustainable integrated underwater and above water Internet of Things sensor network, able to collect water measurements in a cloud database and make them available to researchers to monitor the status of a certain area and develop their predictions models. Simulation results highlight how Low-Power Wide-Area Networks can support the data collection from a dense sensor deployment.					; Campagnaro, Filippo/AAB-1333-2020; Airoldi, Laura/I-3553-2019; Zorzi, Michele/JZT-7485-2024; Pozzebon, Alessandro/I-7177-2012	Airoldi, Laura/0000-0001-5046-0871; Pozzebon, Alessandro/0000-0003-3991-8858													0197-7385		978-1-6654-6809-1				2022										10.1109/OCEANS47191.2022.9977287	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS47191.2022.9977287													WOS:000925311400335
J	da Costa, ID; Nunes, NND				da Costa, Igor David; dos Santos Nunes, Natalia Neto			Niche partitioning of two piscivorous fish species in a river in the western Brazilian Amazon	IHERINGIA SERIE ZOOLOGIA												We analyzed the seasonal variation in the diet, trophic niche breadth (Levins index), the partitioning of food resources (Pianka's symmetric index) and trophic level (weighed average of trophic level of each prey determined in FishBase and SeaLifeBase platform) of Plagioscion squamosissimus (Heckel, 1840) and Hydrolycus scomberoides (Cuvier, 1819) in the Machado River, Rondonia, Brazil. Fish samplings were conducted bimonthly from June 2013 to May 2015 in five sites, using eight sets of gillnets. The occurrence frequency and volumetric frequency were used to quantify the food items. We analyzed the stomach contents of 283 individuals, 134 of H. scomberoides and 149 of P. squamosissimus. Fish were the most consumed food item by both piscivorous species. However, H. scomberoides mostly ingested pelagic fish (e.g. Characiformes fishes and Prochilodus nigricas Spix & Agassiz, 1829), while P. squamosissimus mostly consumed benthic fish [e.g. Pimelodus blochii Valenciennes, 1840 and Tenellus trimaculatus (Boulenger, 1898)]. Hydrolycus scomberoides presented the trophic level 3.55 for both periods analyzed, while P. squamosissimus 4.01 in the flood period and 3.82 in the drought period. Seasonal variations in the diet of H. scomberoides and P. squamosissimus were observed (PERMANOVA). Specifically, P. squamosissimus consumed mainly "Siluriformes" fishes and P. blochii in the drought period. The trophic niche breadth of P. squamosissimus was greater than that of H. scomberoides in the flood period. The species P. squamosissimus and H. scomberoides had low (0.35) food niche overlap in both seasons analysed. The data indicated that P. squamosissimus has a generalist feeding habit, while H. scomberoides is specialized in prey selection. The overlap of food niche between the species in both periods of the hydrological cycle was low, indicating that niche partitioning was probably the main mechanism of coexistence of these species, with little relationship with variations of the hydrological cycle.

J	Irdem, E; Ilhan, S				Irdem, Emine; Ilhan, Semra			Diversity of Moniliaceous Fungi in Camalti Saltern, Izmir, Turkey	SYDOWIA												This study aims to determine microfungal diversity (Moniliaceae family) in the Camalti Saltern, Turkey. Water samples were seasonally taken from four stations in the Camalti Saltern ponds. Microfungi were isolated by membrane filtration method using DRBC and DRBC10. The isolates have been identified using morphological and molecular techniques.The average numbers of all the fungal colonies were determined to be 14 CFU/100 ml and 28 CFU/100 ml on DRBC and DRBC10 media, respectively. A total of 35 species belonging to 5 genera have been identified. These genera were Acremonium (1 species), Aspergillus (14 species), Fusarium (2 species), Penicillium (16 species), and Trichoderma (2 species). According to their relative abundance, the dominant genus isolated on DRBC and DRBC10 medium, was Penicillium (47 %). This study notes that the aquatic mycobiota of Camalti Saltern has a high diversity and most of the isolated species are inhabitants of hypersaline environments. Successful results were obtained by using DRBC and DRBC10 on the isolation of the species that have different salt requirements. Using molecular techniques as well as classical techniques, identification of micro fungus has been complemental as the classical techniques are inadequate. This study represents the first survey of moniliacueous fungi in Izmir Camalti Saltern and provides data on their diversity and distribution.

Monitoring of lakes with remote sensing technologies has become popular in recent years. The management of the lakes with the right policies is crucial in terms of protection and sustainability. In this study, the spatial and temporal changes of Terkos Lake, one of the most important drinking water resources of Istanbul, were examined using satellite images between 2000 and 2020. In order to analyze this temporal change in the water surface area of Terkos Lake, 1160 existing Landsat TM, ETM+ and OLI images were processed on the Google Earth Engine cloud platform. Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) was used to extract the water surface of the lake. The obtained water surface areas were evaluated with annual and seasonal trends. According to the results, the water surface area of the lake in 2000 and 2020 was compared. There is 6.9% decrease in 2020 compared to 2000. When the main reasons for this decrease are investigated, it is determined that the lake is in danger of extinction due to the rapid population growth and unstable precipitation regime in Istanbul.					; Balcik, Filiz/ABB-1421-2020; Yagmur Aydin, Nur/AAA-7286-2020	Yagmur, Nur/0000-0002-5915-6929; 														2564-6761					2022	7	3					235	242		10.29128/geomatik.975714	http://dx.doi.org/10.29128/geomatik.975714													WOS:000906296600006
J	Lasater, A; Haggard, B				Lasater, Abbie; Haggard, Brian			Water quality concentration trends and loads identify management needs in the Lake Wister watershed	AGROSYSTEMS GEOSCIENCES & ENVIRONMENT												Trend analyses of water quality seek to determine whether concentrations of constituents have increased or decreased over time, which can show the effectiveness of management practices or the need for pollutant reduction. The Poteau River watershed (PRW) is a transboundary watershed across Arkansas and Oklahoma and, in Arkansas, has been listed as a priority watershed within the Arkansas Nonpoint Source Pollution Plan since 1998. The Poteau River, Black Fork, and Fourche Maline within the PRW flow into Lake Wister, which is an important reservoir for recreation, fishing, and waterfowl hunting for residents and tourists around eastern Oklahoma. The purpose of this study was to analyze long-term concentration trends and loads on the major tributaries entering Lake Wister using the Weighted Regression on Time, Discharge, and Season (WRTDS). The largest magnitude of loads came from the Poteau River, but flow normalized (FN) P and sediments have decreased over time, which is a positive impact of watershed management and must be maintained. However, FN N on the Poteau River has increased over time and should be the focus of future management on the Poteau River. Although the magnitude of constituent loads from the Fourche Maline is less than from the Poteau River, increasing FN P is a concern and should be prioritized for management in Oklahoma. The relatively undisturbed Black Fork watershed contributes the smallest loads to Lake Wister, and FN concentrations are decreasing or not changing over time, suggesting a low priority for the Black Fork watershed.

Their biomass, especially in juvenile stages, contributes the most to the fish production of these ecosystems. In Bovan Reservoir, these two species constitute the bulk of the juvenile fish biomass. This study aimed to investigate the feeding composition of these two species in order to evaluate their niche overlap due to the availability of resources during different seasons. Traditional diet analysis indices and Kohonen artificial neural network (i.e., a self-organizing map, SOM) were used to investigate the diet of 158 individuals of both species and evaluate their food niche overlap. The indicator value (IndVal) was applied to identify indicator food categories based on which the contents of their alimentary tracts were grouped first into neurons and then into clusters on the SOM. Our results showed that juvenile fish used zooplankton and benthic prey in their diet. Roach often fed on nonanimal prey, while perch of age 0+ used fishes in the diet. Additionally, four clusters of neurons were isolated on the SOM output network. The distribution of perch and roach alimentary tracts in neurons indicated no high degree of competition between them. While diet analyses indices show which food category is generally important in specimens' diet, the SOM recognizes those specimens and arranges them together into the same or adjacent neurons based on dominant prey. Understanding fish feeding habits is critical for the development of conservation and management plans. Since Bovan is a eutrophic reservoir, our knowledge of fish feeding habits needs to be considered for stocking strategies in the future.					; Milošković, Aleksandra/AAQ-6464-2021	Radenkovic, Milena/0000-0002-2052-4464; Jakovljevic, Marija/0000-0002-2168-7548; Miloskovic, Aleksandra/0000-0003-2407-7099; Duretanovic, Simona/0000-0003-4508-161X; Kojadinovic, Natasa/0000-0001-9847-3823; Velickovic, Tijana/0000-0001-9152-056X													0137-1592	1734-1515					2022	52	1					77	90		10.3897/aiep.52.78215	http://dx.doi.org/10.3897/aiep.52.78215													WOS:000779548800005

Because applications of insecticides remain the most effective, and often the only available tool to prevent or control mosquito-borne disease outbreaks, their use and scope continue to expand. However, the effects of multiple insecticide applications targeting adult mosquitoes on nontarget insect communities remain poorly characterized. To remedy this knowledge gap, we conducted an evaluation of five aerial insecticide applications on insect communities in a natural environment near Salt Lake City, Utah. Employing a before-after-control-impact approach, we assessed abundance and community composition changes over the study period utilizing Bayesian and community ecology analytical methods. We observed no discernible effects on most insect taxa, and there were no changes in the overall insect community composition. The abundance of Diptera, Coleoptera, and Hemiptera declined in control and treatment sites, Odonata increased over the period of the study, and Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera remained similar, suggesting seasonal trends rather than treatment effects. The only consistently detectable treatment effect was on nonbiting midges (Diptera: Chironomidae), that are closely related to mosquitoes taxonomically and have similar body size and diel activity. Midge abundance declined by 79.9% (95% credible interval: 58.4-91.9). Overall posttreatment abundance decline of 62.2% (95% credible interval: 22.5-87.8) was also detected for leafhoppers (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae), but, these declines were inconsistent and may be attributed to natural variability rather than the treatment effect. Treatment frequency, location, life-stage targeting, and application techniques may mitigate the effects of mosquito control on nontarget insects to allow protecting human health while limiting environmental impacts.

A technical and economic evaluation of supplemental feeding strategies for Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus L.) reared in lake-based cages	ISRAELI JOURNAL OF AQUACULTURE-BAMIDGEH												Tilapia cage farming in eutrophic lakes uses low stocking densities since tilapias can thrive mainly on natural food or minimal supplementary feeding. For semi-intensive Nile tilapia cage culture, feeding strategies to improve productivity are adopted based on technical viability and cost efficiency, as assessed in the present study. Tilapia fingerlings stocked in triplicate cages per treatment were reared in Laguna de Bay, Philippines for five months, one run each during the dry and wet seasons. The treatments were: I - UNFED or no feeding; II - FED, fish fed for the entire 155 days; III - D45, fish fed from day 45 to harvest; and IV - D75, or fish fed from day 75 to harvest. Average weight gain or AWG (153.18 g and 225.85g, for dry and wet seasons, respectively) were highest in FED. Growth parameters in all fed treatments were significantly higher (p<0.05) than in UNFED for both seasons. Survival rates were higher during the wet season (66-70%) compared to the dry season (35-37%). Moreover, in the wet season, when the lake's primary productivity is low, full feeding can be done without compromising lake water quality. Results showed that it favored high AWG, survival, reasonable market price, and profit.

Traditional water monitoring is performed by manual sampling, which is limited both in the spatial and the temporal domain. The proposed method will expand the range of measurements while reducing the cost. Human sampling is still included in order to provide a base of comparison and ground truth for the automated measurements.

REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENTOMOLOGIA												Acrostichum danaeifolium, a Neotropical fern, occurs preferentially in marshy areas or at the margins of lakes and mangroves. Microlepidoptera larvae burrow through the petioles of the fern, preferentially on the non-expanded leaves. The galleries in the petiole create a new microhabitat, harboring a rich fauna of arthropods. The aim of the present study was to assess the richness of ants associated with its petiole. The study was conducted in a population of A. danaefolium from the Atlantic Forest in Rio de Janeiro state, Southeastern Brazil. Six collections were carried out every two months (2009-2010), three in the dry and three in the rainy season. The leaves were divided into three development stages: non-expanded leaves (NEL), expanded leaves (EL) and senescent leaves (SL). Seven leaves from each phase were randomly collected from seven individuals. A total of fifteen ant species were recorded. The species with the highest frequency and density in fern petioles were Camponotus crassus and Crematogaster curvispinosa. The highest ant richness and abundance was found in senescent leaves. The high number of ants found in the petioles of Acrostichum danaefolium qualifies it as a potential key species in the marshes and flooded areas where it occurs.

POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES												The existence of alternative stable states and hysteresis underpinned by positive feedback mechanisms explains why it is often difficult to restore submerged macrophytes in shallow lakes. It is especially difficult to restore water quality of turbid tropical lakes. It has been speculated that transplanting macrophytes tolerant of high turbidity may help the system escape from the turbid state, but systematic assessments are so far largely lacking. Here we conducted a mesocosm transplanting experiment in a shallow lake of subtropical China to mimic macrophyte restoration. We transplanted three common native turbidity-tolerant submerged macrophyte species in shallow-water mesocosms and monitored water quality within one growing season. Our experiment demonstrated that following artificial recolonization, the submerged macrophytes could indeed persist in turbid shallow water. However, the persistence of submerged macrophytes cannot significantly improve water quality, and cannot reverse the ecosystem state of tropical shallow lakes within one growing season. Our results thus provide useful implications to the current lake restoration practices. In real-world situations, it may not be realistic to anticipate rapid restoration through macrophyte transplantation only. Monitoring the long-term effects of macrophyte transplantation is imperative for lake restoration. Our work highlights the need to harness the nuanced hidden complexity for tropical lake restoration and calls for attention to alternative stable states among practitioners of lake management.

It is one of the most important natural recreational and culture fishing area in the region. Although the lake has been constructed for irrigation and supply energy in the past, it is considered as a drinking water supply for Antalya in near future. However, it was mentioned that the lake suffers from eutrophication problem in recent scientific studies. So, the evaluation of water quality in the lake with different geostatistical techniques will facilitate the work of the managers to determine precautions and improve the water quality. In this study, water quality measurements were performed at 22 sampling locations in Karacaoren-II Dam Lake. Field works were carried out in November 2015 and August 2016. Firstly, spatial distribution maps of SD, DO and NO3-N were constituted using non-statistical Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) and the statistical Ordinary Kriging (OK) interpolation methods within geostatistical analyst tool of ArcGIS program. Then, seasonal changes of the distributions were evaluated. Error metrics obtained from cross-validation was used to assess correctness of the interpolation methods. The results showed that both methods were effective in the identification of problematic zones. Higher SD and relatively lower DO values were clustered near outlet of the lake. DO was more sensitive to microscale variations.

Taking Zhuyu Lake as the research object, the Spatio-temporal variations of water salinity under different seasons were investigated using the field survey and modeling. The influencing factors of the water salinity of the reservoir were analyzed to discover the variation mechanism. The results showed that the disturbance of overlying water is the most significant factor affecting the salt release of sediment, and salt release was increased by 63.3% with the disturbance. The depth of the overlying water and the salt content of bottom sediment also significantly affected the release of salt, with maximum enhancement by 23.1% and 45.6%, respectively. The microbial content in the bottom mud played an essential role in maintaining the salt, and inhibiting the microbial activity could enhance the release of salt by 35.7%. Therefore, disturbing the sediment by using disturbance ships or aeration devices, and the establishment of a long-term periodic plant harvesting belt could be used in the coastal fresh reservoirs desalination and slowing down the salinization of fresh reservoirs.

J	DOUST, JL; LAPORTE, G				DOUST, JL; LAPORTE, G			POPULATION SEX-RATIOS, POPULATION MIXTURES AND FECUNDITY IN A CLONAL DIOECIOUS MACROPHYTE, VALLISNERIA-AMERICANA	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												(1) Sex ratios and plant densities were determined for three populations of Vallisneria americana in the Detroit River-St Clair River system (Great Lakes Basin, North America). Line transects were made at each of the three sites, and for each individual its location, sex (where possible), leaf number and number of connected ramets were recorded. In this clonal aquatic macrophyte, the majority of ramets (58-72%) did not flower. The flowering ramets were significantly male-biased in their sex ratio, ranging from a male:female ratio of 9.9:1 at the northernmost, upstream site, to 3.2:1 at the southernmost site. Sites differed in the density of shoots present. (2) Female plants had significantly greater mass and more leaves than males at each site. This suggests that female ramets need to be larger before they are capable of flowering. Approximately half of all male flowers examined at the three sites were sterile (lacked pollen). (3) Plants collected at the beginning of the growing season were raised in experimental pools, and all combinations of plants from the three natural populations, including representatives of each population alone, were allowed to grow for the season. Plant fitness was assessed when female flowers were exposed to pollen from their home site, or to pollen from all combinations of alien sites in addition to their home-site pollen. (4) Ramet densities in each pool were identical at the outset of the experiment; by final harvest, however, the ranking of the densities in the pure culture pools had become the same as the ranking of densities at the three field sites. This suggests that populations may be differentiated in their relative extents of clonal growth. (5) Fruit set in the experiment was comparable to field results, but seed set fruit-1 was lower than in the field, suggesting pollen limitation. Certain treatments produced greater numbers of shoots (pools containing only plants collected from Sarnia, and pools having mixtures which included plants from Sarnia). As a direct result of its greater clonal growth, plants from Sarnia also produced the greatest number of fruits per unit area. The pattern of results for fecundity suggested that hybrid vigour may have been occurring in some combinations.																			0022-0477	1365-2745				JUN	1991	79	2					477	489		10.2307/2260727	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2260727													WOS:A1991GX79600016
J	Luo, J; Fox, BJ				Luo, J; Fox, BJ			Competitive effects of Rattus lutreolus presence on food resource use by Pseudomys gracilicaudatus	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												We examined faecal samples of the eastern chestnut mouse (Pseudomys gracilicaudatus) that were collected during a removal experiment conducted in a coastal heathland at Myall Lakes National Park to see whether removal of the swamp rat (Rattus lutreolus) had any effects on food resource use by P. gracilicaudatus. The results showed that, at the young successional stage of vegetation (1.5 years since last fire), the diet of P. gracilicaudatus changed significantly after the number of R. lutreolus was significantly reduced on the experimental sites. Two months after the removal treatment was terminated there were no significant differences between the control and experimental sites. Factor analysis showed that seasonal change was significant for all three food factors on the control sites, whereas on experimental sites the change was significant only for factor 1. At the middle successional stage (3.5 years since last fire), P. gracilicaudatus showed relatively small seasonal changes on both control and experimental sites, and significant differences between the control and experimental sites did not occur until after the removal manipulation was completed, showing a delayed response. Comparisons of the young and the middle successional stages on both control and experimental sites showed that P. gracilicaudatus used proportionally different food when R, lutreolus was present, but consumed similar food when R, lutreolus was removed. These results suggest that R, lutreolus might have restricted the access of P. gracilicaudatus to better microhabitats, and hence to a better food supply. The ecological implication of these results is that the interpretation of observed population and community patterns must take into account the direct effects of species interactions.

Does where they start affect where they finish? A multimethod investigation of the role of stocking location on survival and dispersal of hatchery-reared Lake Sturgeon in Missouri River tributaries	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Despite ongoing Lake Sturgeon recovery efforts, little is known about the role of stocking location on survival and dispersal to nursery habitats. We stocked age-0 Lake Sturgeon at four sites in two adjacent Missouri River tributaries and used telemetry to examine whether survival and dispersal differed among stocking sites and rivers. Survival estimates from Barker Cormack-Jolly-Seber models that incorporated both receiver detections and auxiliary manual detections were higher than spatial capture-recapture models that only included receiver detections. Barker model overwinter survival averaged 53% and provided information to adjust individual censoring in spatial capture-recapture model dispersal estimates. Within the two rivers, stocking site had little effect on activity centers with individuals from both sites converging upon similar locations by the end of the study period. However, dispersal distance and direction differed among stocking locations. Our overwinter survival estimates of stocked age-0 Lake Sturgeon in Missouri River tributaries were equal to or higher than other studied populations suggesting stocked juveniles may be contributing to the recovering population. Tributaries were important overwintering nursery locations with high stream fidelity that may contribute to future homing among adults.

Phytoplankton community of Reis lake in the Brazilian Amazon	ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS												Reis Lake is located in the municipality of Caracarai, state of Roraima (Brazil) and is subject to fluctuations in water level. The aim of this study was to analyze the structure of the phytoplankton community on the nictemeral and seasonal scales and determined the influence of limnological variables. Sampling was performed in the rainy season (June/2006) and dry season (November/2006), considering two nictemeral cycles. The phytoplankton community was assessed with regard to composition and density, abiotic variables were analyzed simultaneously. The lake had low concentrations of oxygen, clinograde profile and water stratified during the day and homogenous at night, with low concentrations of nutrients and waters ranging from slightly acidic to alkaline. The phytoplankton was represented by 43 taxa, 35 species in the dry season and 29 species in the rainy season. Low densities of phytoplankton occurred in both nictemeral cycles, with accentuated vertical gradient. The highest densities were recorded in the dry season. Reis Lake exhibits characteristics that classify it as a polymythic and oligotrophic environment. The variability in the data was more important seasonally than on the nictemeral scale, supporting the hypothesis of the influence of the hydrological cycle on the dynamics of phytoplankton communities in floodplain lakes.

J	Mistri, M; Rossi, R				Mistri, M; Rossi, R			Structure and production of the benthic macroinvertebrate community in a shallow lagoon of the Po River Delta	ITALIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												The composition and the secondary production of a benthic macroinvertebrate community in a brackish lake located in the southernmost area of the Po River Delta was investigated. Three stations (N, C, and S) were selected and sampled quarterly for macrofauna and environmental parameters. Data were subjected to multivariate statistical analysis to discriminate between seasonality and sites on their faunistic attributes, and univariate measures of community stress were determined. Water parameter values were typical of eutrophic areas. A total of 23 species belonging to four phyla were identified. Macrobenthic faunal assemblages of the lake were dominated by deposit-feeders. At the three sampling sites, polychaetes were the most abundant taxon, accounting respectively for 65.3%, 87.9% and 51.6% of the total number of individuals. Substratum characteristics, together with fluctuations in environmental parameters, played an important role in structuring faunistic assemblages. In terms of biomass, molluscs made the greatest contribution at stations N and S, representing, respectively, 56.3% and 55.2% of total biomass, while polychaetes contributed mostly to station C with 73.6%. Mean annual production of the macrobenthic community of the lake was estimated as 5.2 g AFDW 0.06 m(-2) yr(-1), with a production/biomass ratio (P/B) of 2.1.																			1125-0003	1748-5851					1999	66	4					361	368		10.1080/11250009909356278	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11250009909356278													WOS:000085017700010
J	DAVISON, W; SEED, G				DAVISON, W; SEED, G			THE KINETICS OF THE OXIDATION OF FERROUS IRON IN SYNTHETIC AND NATURAL-WATERS	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												The rate of oxidation of ferrous Fe in a seasonally anoxic lake was measured on 39 occasions with respect to both depth and time. Sample disturbance was minimal as only O2 had to be introduced to initiate the reaction. The data were consistent with the simple rate law for homogeneous chemical kinetics previously established for synthetic solutions. The rate constant for the oxidation reaction in lake water was indistinguishable from that measured in synthetic samples. It did not appear to be influenced by changes in the microbial populations or by changes in any particulate or soluble components in the water, including Fe and Mn. Analysis of the errors inherent in the kinetic measurements showed that the estimation of pH was the major source of inaccuracy and that values of the rate constant determined by different workers could easily differ by a factor of 6. The present data, together with a comprehensive survey of the literature, are used to suggest a universal rate constant of .apprx. 2 .times. 1013 M-2 atm-1 min-1 (range 1.5-3 .times. 1013) in the rate law -d[Fe II]/dt = k[Fe II]pO2 (OH-)2 for natural freshwaters in the pH range 6.5-7.4. Discrepancies in the effects of ionic strength and interfering substances reported in the literature are highlighted. Substances only interfere at concentrations which far exceed those in most natural waters.

Composition and diversity of ichthyofauna in La Vina reservoir (Cordoba, Argentina)	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY												Several dams have been built in central and north Argentina. There are more than 20 reservoirs in Cordoba province, with a total estimated surface area of around 15,000 ha. Although construction of dams continues, some aspects about the richness, abundance and diversity of ichthyofauna in many of these environments are unknown, which prevents adequate management of fish resources. The goal of this work was to evaluate specific richness and diversity of ichthyofauna in La Vina reservoir (31 degrees 47' S and 65 degrees 01' W, 1,050 ha, 846 m asl), one of the major reservoirs in Cordoba. Fifteen seasonal samplings were made in 1999-2002 using trawl nets and gillnets. A total of 3,242 specimens belonging to 7 species distributed in 5 orders and 5 families were caught. The tetra Astyanax eigenmanniorum (52.9%) and the silverside Odontesthes bonariensis (29.3%) were the most abundant species; the latter is the main target species for lake fishing and had greatest biomass (63.8%). Average diversity for all samples was H'(T) = 1.63 (95% confidence interval 1.49 to 1.77). Shannon-Wiener and Simpson diversity indexes values were generally intermediate. Specific richness of La Vina reservoir was moderate compared with other impoundments in central and north Argentina.

Due to uncertainties in model structure and/or model parameters in addition to natural and seasonal variability of forcing functions, estimation of waste loads in a TMDL analysis requires a margin of safety (MOS). The margin of safety is typically incorporated implicitly through conservative assumptions used to develop the TMDL or added explicitly as a separate component of the TMDL. For successful TMDL development, accurate and appropriate predictions of waste loads from a watershed and the variation of water quality in a water body are essential. This paper Summarizes the estimation process of the MOS in the Nakdong River, Korea considering variability in observed data and the uncertainty in the model. Approved TMDL reports in eight northeastern states in US were used for guidance.

The quantitative description of the algal population growth is of primary importance to understand the mechanisms which lead to these phytoplankton blooms, hence also for the development of a successful water-quality management. Due to the high degree of complexity of phytoplankton blooms, dynamic simulation models may be a powerful tool to study and elucidate the mechanisms leading to these blooms. In the present study, a simulation model for the blooming of a natural population of Oscillatoria agardhii in Lake Vechten (lat. 52 degrees 04'N, long. 5 degrees 05'E, the Netherlands) using measured temperature, filament length and nutrient concentrations as external drives, is presented. The lake was sampled weekly from January to the middle of May, 1992. Temperature, nutrient concentration (nitrate and phosphate in the water) and filament length were recorded. Because cell size was constant, filament length could be converted to number of cells per litre to estimate algal biomass. To implement the model additional information, e.g. some algal growth parameters, was obtained from the literature. The model simulated well the growth of the Oscillatoria agardhii population in the lake during the research period. According to the model, temperature was the most important rate-limitating factor for growth at the beginning of the year. Nutrient limitation became increasingly important while the importance of temperature limitation decreased during the season. During the whole period, light was strongly limiting and became the most important rate-limiting factor in the second week of April. Via sensitivity analysis, the model showed to be highly affected by temperature-related factors, and it was useful in the identification of research needs.

E. suratensis and O. mossambicus fed predominately on blue green algae, whereas P. maculatus preferred aquatic insects. Trophic niche breadth analysis showed that P. maculatus had a broader diet spectrum than did E. suratensis and O. mossambicus. Feeding strategy analysis through dominant prey items showed that E. suratensis and O. mossambicus preferred blue green algae, whereas P. maculatus relied mostly on animal diet (mainly insects), highlighting food segregation shown by this species compared with the other two large-growing cichlids. The highest diet overlap index value was recorded between E. suratensis and O. mossambicus (0.83), compared with P. maculatus and O. mossambicus (0.69), and E. suratensis and P. maculatus (0.64). Intensity of trophic interdependence among the three cichlids showed that the two, large growing species share available food resources, whereas the smaller species considerably alters its food preference.

Whole lake mean monthly densities were greatest in mid-May (199.4 org/L) and least in mid-June (83.9 org/L). Mean zooplankton density was a third greater in the Red River arm compared to the Washita River arm and Main Lake zone. Percent composition was similar among the five zones with rotifers making up the largest proportion followed by the nauplii, cladocera, cyclopoid copepods and calanoid copepods. Bray-Curtis Similarity Index at the genus level showed zooplankton community composition was most similar between the Red River zone and Red River Transition zone, Washita River zone and Washita River Transition zone and Main Lake zone with the Main Lake zone being most similar to the Red River arm. Lake Texoma can be classified as eutrophic based upon the presence of rotifer and cladoceran indicator species and the ratio of calanoid to cyclopoid copepods plus cladoceran species.																			0040-4403					AUG	2001	53	3					203	220																WOS:000171174400001

Daily and seasonal population dynamics of Brachynotus sexdentatus (Risso, 1827) (Varunidae: Brachyura: Decapoda) in a temperate coastal lake	ACTA ADRIATICA												The grapsoid Brachynotus sexdentatus (Risso, 1827) is a small sized Mediterranean crab, whose ecology is poorly known despite frequently cited in the scientific literature. High densities occasionally recorded in estuarine habitats suggest this opportunistic species might play a functional role in connecting benthic primary production with consumption at higher trophic levels. The brackish Lake Ganzirri (north-eastern Sicily) hosts a population of this varunid crab, whose differential distribution of juveniles and adults, respectively found on hard and soft substrates, involves different habitat preferences and consequent resource partitioning. Investigation on daily and seasonal dynamics of the soft-bottom dwelling adults showed a male biased population, with size-related differences between sex, station, season and female reproductive phase. Our data, suggesting an annual life span, prolonged spawning and related continuous recruitment; are in agreement with the intrinsic unpredictability of the colonized brackish environment. At last, preliminary in aquaria observations on the characteristic male cheliped vesicles, showed they might involved in agonistic and courtship behaviour.

WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Wild rice (WR; Zizania palustris L.) growth response to sediment obtained from Rat River Bay (RRB; control site), Cleaver Lake (CL; legacy zinc-copper mine influenced), and Unnamed Lake (UL; active gold mine influenced) was evaluated by two bioassay systems: (1) a mesocosm-scale bioassay and (2) an accelerated-growth microcosm-scale bioassay. Following an entire growing season of 7 weeks, WR developed to near reproductive maturity, with similar observations using both systems. WR height (HT), dry weight biomass (DWB), and seed production (SP) were statistically higher in RRB than both CL and UL sediment-grown plants. Significant differences were not identified between mesocosm:microcosm ratios for DWB or SP; HT ratios were significant. Wild rice HT, DWB, and SP were statistically lower for CL and UL sediment-grown plants; however, visual differences in growth between sediments were documented mid-season. By the end of the season, ammonia-nitrogen (N) was below detection in CL and UL sediment and decreased by 93% in RRB sediment. Responses of WR to these sediment exposures appeared to be more influenced by ammonia-N concentration than other sediment constituents. Based on data obtained during this study, the microcosm-scale bioassay accurately represented the mesocosm-scale bioassay in terms of WR DWB and SP, both of which were visually recognized. Use of this microcosm-scale bioassay to obtain accurate representations of WR responses to site-specific sediment, or water, exposures can save industry and critical water resource managers time, money, and overall resources.																			0049-6979	1573-2932				DEC	2021	232	12							508	10.1007/s11270-021-05467-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-021-05467-8													WOS:000728547500002
J	HINES, ME				HINES, ME			EMISSIONS OF BIOGENIC SULFUR GASES FROM ALASKAN TUNDRA	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Fluxes of the biogenic sulfur gases carbonyl sulfide (COS), dimethyl sulfide (DMS), methyl mercaptan (MeSH), and carbon disulfide (CS2) were determined for several freshwater and coastal marine tundra habitats using a dynamic enclosure method and gas chromatography. In the freshwater tundra sites, highest emissions, with a mean of 6.0 nmol m-2 h-1 (1.5-10) occurred in the water-saturated wet meadow areas inhabited by grasses, sedges and Sphagnum mosses. In the drier upland tundra sites, highest fluxes occurred in areas inhabited by mixed vegetation and labrador tea at 3.0 nmol m-2 h-1 (0-8.3) and lowest fluxes were from lichen-dominated areas at 0.9 nmol m-2 h-1. Sulfur emissions from a lake surface were also low at 0.8 nmol m-2 h-1. Of the compounds measured, DMS was the dominant gas emitted from all of these sites. Sulfur emissions from the marine sites were up to 20-fold greater than fluxes in the freshwater habitats and were also dominated by DMS. Emissions of DMS were highest from intertidal soils inhabited by Carex subspathacea (150-250 nmol m-2 h-1). This Carex sp. was grazed thoroughly by geese and DMS fluxes doubled when goose feces were left within the flux chamber. Emissions were much lower from other types of vegetation which were more spatially dominant. Sulfur emissions from tundra were among the lowest reported in the literature. When emission data were extrapolated to include all tundra globally, the global flux of biogenic sulfur from this biome is 2-3 x 10(8) g yr-1. This represents less than 0.001% of the estimated annual global flux (approximately 50 Tg) of biogenic sulfur and <0.01% of the estimated terrestrial flux. The low emissions are attributed to the low availability of sulfate, certain hydrological characteristics of tundra, and the tendency for tundra to accumulate organic matter.																			2169-897X	2169-8996				OCT 30	1992	97	D15					16703	16707		10.1029/90JD02576	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/90JD02576													WOS:A1992JW72000021
J	MCELRAVY, EP; RESH, VH				MCELRAVY, EP; RESH, VH			DISTRIBUTION AND SEASONAL OCCURRENCE OF THE HYPORHEIC FAUNA IN A NORTHERN CALIFORNIA STREAM	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The surface and hyporheic fauna of a second-order reach of a northern California Coast Range stream (Big Canyon Creek, Lake Co., CA, USA) was examined using substrate colonization samplers (i.e. hyporheic pots) during both the wet and dry seasons in the prevailing Mediterranean climate of the region. In terms of total number of macroinvertebrate taxa, the surface (0 cm to -5.0 cm within the stream substrate) level had higher richness than any level within the hyporheic (-5.1 cm to -15.0 cm, -15.1 cm to -25.0 cm, or -25.1 cm to -35.0 cm) from the beginning of the dry season (May) to the beginning of the wet season (October); during this period the surface was not subject to disturbance from wet-season storms. During the wet season, richness at the surface was similar to that observed at any of the three hyporheic levels examined. Macroinvertebrate density at the surface was substantially reduced during the wet season; however, mean surface densities always exceeded those found within the hyporheic zone (from 25% to 78% of total macroinvertebrate numbers were found at the surface). Seasonal fluctuations in abundance of total macroinvertebrates and density of many constituent populations were less within the hyporheic zone than at the surface. Apparently, early instars of abundant surface taxa do not penetrate the interstices, and substrate disturbance due to spates is less in deeper levels. Compared with many hyporheic faunas described from other temperate-zone sites, this hyporheic community shows reduced numerical dominance by the Chironomidae.																			0018-8158					AUG 15	1991	220	3					233	246		10.1007/BF00006579	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00006579													WOS:A1991GK31000006

Icefish have lived in Lake Abashiri since the early 1930s because of climate change and topographical features, and have been caught by commercial fisheries. Their population size fluctuated annually from 1 to 94 tons. The periodicity of one-year intervals relating to the life-history of icefish was observed in yearly catches. Population sites at the beginning of each fishing season were estimated to be 36,763 x 10(3)-487,590 x 10(3) individuals based on the daily CPUE and the density of juveniles. The icefish seem to be stimulated to migrate seaward by rising water and flooding, resulting in an abrupt decline in commercial catches and high spawner abundance in the following year. The relationship between the number of adults and recruitment fitted well to Ricker's reproduction model.

Determine the effect of non-genetic factors and breed group, on the useful life (UL) of dual-purpose cows. Materials and methods. Records from 2098 cows were used in the analysis which included all the females who entered to the reproductive program and were culled or died. The data came from two dual-purpose commercial herds located in the basin of the Lake of Maracaibo in Trujillo State. The UL was quantified in number of calving upon culling. The parameters included in the model were: herd (H: AG, VV), year of the first calving (Y1C: 1995-2006), season of the first calving (S1C: January-March, April-May, June-August, September-December), breed group (BG: Zebu, 50%Zebu50European; ZE, Milking Crossbred; MC) and the interaction HxBG y Y1CxBG. Results. The UL average was 2.63 (0.07) calvings. All the factors had highly significant effects (p < 0.01) on UL, however, H did not affect UL. It is interesting to highlight that HxBG and Y1CxBG interactions were highly significant (p < 0.01) indicating that breed groups behave differently in every herd and during the course of the years. Conclusions. Non-genetic factors and breed group have a high influence on UL.																			0122-0268					MAY-AUG	2013	18	2					3459	3466		10.21897/rmvz.168	http://dx.doi.org/10.21897/rmvz.168													WOS:000323351700005

The lakes chosen encompass an extremely wide gradient in trophic status - Manasbal (less polluted and mesotrophic), Dal (moderately polluted and eutrophic) and Anchar (strongly polluted and hypertrophic). The results indicate that infrapopulation-level descriptors of abundance of C. schizothoraxi in fish differed between the three lakes and revealed that the infection levels were greater at Anchar Lake. Furthermore, the prevalence, mean abundance and mean intensity of infection also changed during the period of investigation along the seasonal gradient of water temperature. The fact that the abundance patterns of the parasite differed in different populations of the same host provided a unique opportunity for a comparative study on the temporal variations in infection patterns attained during different seasons. In particular, the lake environments showed a high degree of variability in the density profiles of mollusc intermediate hosts and, thus, the differences in the infection status of crucian carp were derived on the basis of intermediate host population size which, in turn, was influenced by the trophic characteristics of the three lakes.

Lake Mangakaware is a 13.3 ha polymictic lake with high nutrient status, low Secchi disc transparencies, and an unstable thermal regime. The four planktonic cladoceran species (Bosmina longirostris, B. meridionalis, Ceriodaphnia pulchella, and C. dubia) exhibited disjunct population maxima. Only B. longirostris was perennially present. All species exhibited low fecundities and low lipid content, indicating that food resources were limited and that competitive interactions and resistance to starvation were probably important in determining species success. Increases in body size in cooler seasons were unrelated to clutch size, giving further support for the view that available food was limited. These results are consistent with previous experimental findings that subtle differences in life history can determine seasonal success and the outcome of competition between similar species.

Fractional water influx rates for M. domesticus (40.3 +/- 1.6% total body-water day(-1)) were significantly higher than those for L. lakedownensis (25.3 +/- 1.2% total body-water day(-1)). Water effluxes were higher in both species of mouse after the passage of a cyclonic storm near the study site. Water flux differences remained significant between species when turnover rates were scaled with body mass. A comparison of water influx rates of M. domesticus with those predicted for field populations of other eutherian rodents showed that rates for M. domesticus on Thevenard Island were higher than expected. In contrast, water influx rates for L. lakedownensis did not differ significantly from expected values for a desert rodent. Rates of sodium influx for M. domesticus (41.7 +/- 3.6 mmol kg(-1) day(-1)) were over twice those of L. lakedownensis (19.7 +/- 4.8 mmol kg(-1) day(-1)), and were reflected in the significantly higher concentrations of sodium ingested in the diet, and excreted in the urine, of M. domesticus. Furthermore, the rate of water influx was positively correlated with the rate of sodium influx in M. domesticus, suggesting that they were obtaining both water and sodium from the one dietary source. There was no evidence to suggest that mice of either species were experiencing water or sodium stress, because water and sodium influxes and effluxes remained in balance. These results suggest that M. domesticus on Thevenard Island had a higher-than-expected daily water requirement, and may represent a mesic deme of house mice that have yet to adapt to the island environment.					; Moro, Dorian/AAS-6459-2021	Bradshaw, Sidney/0000-0001-9068-4060; 													0174-1578					SEP	1999	169	6					419	428		10.1007/s003600050238	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s003600050238								10549142					WOS:000083089500007

During mid-June, hypolimnetic P gradients (0.030-1.045 mg.L-1) developed as internal P loading was high (14.7-18.0 mg.m-2.d-1). Ceratium migrated as much as 4 m into the upper hypolimnion at night. Subsequent increases in Ceratium biomass, gross primary productivity, and chlorophyll a indicated retrieval of hypolimnetic P for production. During early July, anoxia restricted vertical migration of Ceratium into the hypolimnion. Surplus cellular P was low during this period, while alkaline phosphatase activity increased to a maximum, suggesting P limitation of Ceratium production. During late July and August, P-rich interflows from the Eau Galle River entered the reservoir at the base of the epilimnion. Ceratium migrated into these interflows at night, with corresponding increases and decreases in surplus cellular P and alkaline phosphatase activity, respectively. Ceratium production increased to a maximum in early September, following these periods of high external P input. These results directly support the hypothesis that Ceratium can access multiple P sources through vertical migration.																			0706-652X					APR	1992	49	4					694	700		10.1139/f92-078	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f92-078													WOS:A1992HL30500007

Diversity and ecology of algae from the Lower Jordan River, Israel	PLANT BIOSYSTEMS												The Lower Jordan River stretches from the outlet of Lake Kinneret till the Dead Sea and is one of the most polluted rivers in Israel. In order to estimate the aquatic ecosystem of the northern part of the Lower Jordan River we used algal communities as biological indicators in the rainy and dry seasons of 2005 and 2007. We found 152 species of algae and cyanoprokaryotes from seven taxonomic divisions, which were mostly dominated by diatoms accompanied by the greens, blue-greens and euglenoids. The xanthophycean species Heterococcus viridis, a red freshwater alga Audouinella hermannii, and a cyanobacterium Microcrocis marina were found for the first time in Israel. In the ecological analysis we revealed groups of freshwater algae according to pH, salinity, and saprobity as well as temperature, streaming and oxygenation. Quantitative information on the relationship between species and environmental variables was obtained using CCA analysis, emphasizing the major seasonal parameters. The extent of association of species with the environmental variables vector allowed us to determine the bio-sensors and bio-indicators, which may be relevant for monitoring of pollutants in the Lower Jordan River. The combination of bio-indicational methods and statistics were effective in the determination of the main factors influencing algal diversity, as well as in revealing the indicators or bio-sensing species for the most important environmental variables.

Titan Saturn System Mission	2009 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-7	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings				2009 IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 07-14, 2009	Big Sky, MT					Titan is a high priority for exploration, as recommended by NASA's 2006 Solar System Exploration (SSE) Roadmap [1], NASA's 2003 National Research Council (NRC) Decadal Survey [2] and ESA's Cosmic Vision Program Themes.(1,2) Recent revolutionary Cassini-Huygens discoveries have dramatically escalated interest in Titan as the next scientific target in the outer Solar System. Results of this study as documented in the TSSM Final Report [3] and Titan Saturn System Mission (TSSM) NASA/ESA Joint Summary Report [4] demonstrates that an exciting Titan Saturn System Mission (TSSM) that explores two worlds of intense astrobiological interest can be initiated now as a single NASA/ESA collaboration. Following 50 years of space exploration, the Cassini-Huygens mission has revealed the Earth-like world of Saturn's moon Titan and showed the potential habitability of another moon, Enceladus. As anticipated by the 2003 Decadal Survey, recent Cassini-Huygens discoveries have revolutionized our understanding of the Titan system and its potential for harboring the "ingredients" necessary for life. These discoveries reveal that Titan is very rich in organics, possibly contains a vast subsurface ocean, and has energy sources to drive chemical evolution. The complex interaction between the atmosphere and surface produces lakes, dunes, and seasonal changes that are features that Titan shares with Earth. Cassini's discovery of active geysers on Enceladus revealed a second icy moon in the Saturn system that is synergistic with Titan in understanding planetary evolution and in adding another potential abode in the Saturn system for life as we know it. These discoveries have dramatically escalated the interest in Titan as the next scientific target for an outer planet mission. Although the scope of science possible at Titan covers the entire range of planetary science disciplines, the TSSM team has developed a mission that focuses NASA and ESA resources on the highest priority science questions. Results of this study confirm that a flagship-class mission to Titan (including the Saturn system and Enceladus) can be done at acceptable risk within the specified budgetary constraints and can proceed now.																			1095-323X		978-1-4244-2621-8				2009							161	168																WOS:000271964000014

These changes are expected to affect both water availability in the upper catchments of the Jordan River, and the salinity of Lake Kinneret, the source of 30 percent of Israel's water supply. By application of the system modeling approach to both problems, we learned the nature of each system and used it to predict future scenarios of water availability and salinity under various climate change scenarios. The issues of water availability and salinity in the Lake Kinneret watershed are presented in this chapter. We describe here the problem, the various models that were proposed to address the problem, the basic structure of the proposed model, the results of the prediction analysis, and the conclusions regarding future operation policy and feasibility of interventions.																					978-0-203-88438-6				2009							50	66																WOS:000275052200005

Response of the round goby, an invasive fish, to food odours	INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF THEORETICAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY, VOL 30, PT 8, PROCEEDINGS: NOW: INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF LIMNOLOGY	International Association of Theoretical and Applied Limnology Proceedings				30th Congress of the International-Association-of-Theoretical-and-Applied-Limnology	AUG 12-18, 2007	Montreal, CANADA	Int Assoc Theoret & Appl Limnol				The aquatic environment contains rich dissolved compounds that are often detected by teleost fish through highly developed chemosensory systems (JONES 2002). Olfactory systems are important in controlling functions such as feeding and reproduction that are integral to the survival of an individual. Fish often use biochemical products released by con-specifics or other organisms in locating food, mates, predators, and spawning sites (HARA 1993). When exposed to chemical stimuli from food, fish respond by exhibiting searching behaviours that improve their chances of locating and consuming the food source (HARA 2006). The round goby is a bottom-dwelling fish, introduced into the Laurentian Great Lakes presumably by ballast water of transoceanic vessels (JUDE et al. 1992). They have spread rapidly through all 5 Great Lakes due to their broad diet, extended reproductive season, aggressive interactions with other fishes, and parental care (MACINNIS & CORKUM 2000). Like many fish, the round goby use chemoreception to detect odours in their surrounding environment (CORKUM & BELANGER 2007). In this study, we determine the response of round gobies to food odours from lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis [Mitchill]), dreissenids, and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss [Walbaum]) eggs in lab and field experiments.																			0368-0770		978-3-510-54079-2				2009	30		8				1275	1278																WOS:000274244900027
J	Anderson, FJ				Anderson, FJ			A highlight of environmental and engineering geology in Fargo, North Dakota, USA	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY												Several unfavorable environmental and engineering geologic conditions exist in Fargo, North Dakota. Dominantly, the behavior of smectitic clays within the proglacial Lake Agassiz sediments of the Sherack and Brenna Formations creates subsoil instability beneath engineered structures in the Fargo area and slope instability within cutbank meanders of the Red River of the North. Unfavorable engineering geologic conditions encountered include: the elastic deformation of clayey glaciolacustrine soils, shrink-swell properties, inadequate bearing capacities, and mass movements. These conditions are responsible for structural failures including the Fargo Grain Elevator in 1955 and the Northern Pacific railroad grade. Bank failures along the Red River are common due to the inherent instability of Brenna Formation smectitic clays which are subject to plastic deformation in the subsurface, with resultant block failure of overlying Sherack Formation. Recent alluvial sediments due to typical fluvial action and the continued seasonal saturation of cutbank meanders within the floodplain also add to soil instability.																			0943-0105					APR	2006	49	7					1034	1042		10.1007/s00254-005-0142-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00254-005-0142-8													WOS:000236357100010
J	Watras, CJ; Morrison, KA; Kratz, TK				Watras, CJ; Morrison, KA; Kratz, TK			Seasonal enrichment and depletion of Hg and SO4 in Little Rock Lake:: relationship to seasonal changes in atmospheric deposition	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Hg and SO4 are priority pollutants in fresh waters throughout the northern hemisphere; both have atmospheric sources associated with anthropogenic emissions to the lower troposphere. Although depositional change has had a demonstrable impact on lakes over decadal time scales, effects over shorter time scales remain uncertain. To better understand the responsiveness of lakes to changing pollutant inputs, we examined the coupling of water chemistry to atmospheric deposition over time scales of weeks to years in Little Rock Lake. The results indicate that the lake is tightly coupled to its air shed with respect to Hg. The annual cycle of Hg in surface waters closely tracks the annual cycle of Hg in precipitation. For SO4, the annual cycle in lake water is damped and not in phase with the cycle of atmospheric deposition because of more intense internal recycling. These observations are in keeping with the residence times of Hg and S in lake water (Hg in months; S in years). Nevertheless, because atmospheric deposition is the dominant source of both pollutants, trends in lake water track trends in precipitation over a decadal time scale. Thus, remote lakes may be highly responsive to short term changes in Hg deposition, whereas responses to SO4 deposition may be more gradual.																			0706-652X					OCT	2002	59	10					1660	1667		10.1139/F02-134	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F02-134													WOS:000179393400009

Issues of concern when setting these programmes are what to measure, how and when to make these measurements, and how to interpret the data. The role of statistics in addressing these issues is discussed and illustrated using three examples. The first is the upstream/downstream Niagara River monitoring program which is used to: (1) estimate the loads of contaminants to the river and from the river to Lake Ontario- (2) compare the concentrations of various contaminants with water quality standards. The monitoring programme for the Fraser River provides the second example. The Fraser River has, in contrast to the Niagara River, a complicated hydrological cycle which needs to be considered when interpreting water quality changes. The third is the before and after time series experiments for environmental impact assessment. In these examples, parametric and non-parametric methods are used to model seasonality and trends. Techniques for dealing with censored data are also discussed.																			1180-4009					DEC	1993	4	4					381	398		10.1002/env.3170040403	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/env.3170040403													WOS:A1993NB33900002

J	WARD, PI				WARD, PI			A COMPARATIVE FIELD-STUDY OF THE BREEDING-BEHAVIOR OF A STREAM AND A POND POPULATION OF GAMMARUS-PULEX (AMPHIPODA)	OIKOS												The breeding system of the freshwater amphipod crustacean Gammarus pulex (L.) contains a precopulatory phase during which a male carries a female. The seasonal changes in this behaviour were studied in a stream and in a pond population. The length of the guarding phase varied considerably over the seasons. In the stream larger animals of both sexes were at an advantage in reproductive competition and the advantages were greatest at the peak of the breeding period. Animals of both sexes infected with a crystacanth of the parasite Polymorphus were less likely to be paired than were non-infected individuals. In the pond, the life cycle was more similar to that of a lake population of G. lacustris Sars than to the stream population. Pairs were more vulnerable to fish predation than were unpaired males. It is suggested that fish predation prevented all year breeding.																			0030-1299	1600-0706				FEB	1986	46	1					29	36		10.2307/3565376	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3565376													WOS:A1986AZL0800005

The impact of River Ntahangwa on the water quality of this part of Lake Tanganyika was compared with that of an unpolluted river, the Mugere. A shallow bay, not influenced by a river, was used as a reference station. Chemical analyses were carried out at four week intervals during nearly a year. Samples were taken at different distances from the shore and at different depths. River impact was detected up to 100 m from both river mouths. Even at 50 m from the mouth of the polluted River Ntahangwa, no important decrease of dissolved oxygen was detected. Chlorophyll-a maxima were found 100 m from the Ntahangwa mouth, but this was also the case 100 m from shore in the unpolluted bay. Lake water at 60 m depth was saturated with oxygen during the dry season, as it used to be in 1956. The rivers studied descent initially within the lake due to greater sediment load and lower water temperature. Nevertheless, it appears that these rivers mix completely in the lake within 100-300 m from the river mouths. The direct effects from organic pollution of the Ntahangwa on the lake seem to be rather negligible. Appropriate anti-erosion measures should reduce massive sediment discharge into the lake.																			0018-8158					AUG 9	1996	328	2					161	171		10.1007/BF00018713	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00018713													WOS:A1996VG10400007
J	FORSMAN, A				FORSMAN, A			GROWTH-RATE IN DIFFERENT COLOR MORPHS OF THE ADDER, VIPERA-BERUS, IN RELATION TO YEARLY WEATHER VARIATION	OIKOS												Many ectothermic vertebrates such as snakes convert solar radiation into body heat by basking; and in these animals several behavioural and physiological traits including growth are temperature dependent. I performed a five-year capture-mark-recapture study on an insular population of adders. Vipera berus, in order to: examine yearly variation in individual growth rate in relation to weather conditions and prey abundance; test for a difference in growth rate between melanistic and zig-zag patterned adders with different thermoregulatory capacities: examine whether individual differences in growth rates were consistent among years. Size-specific growth rates varied significantly among years. Growth rates were lowest in the two years that had the largest proportion of cloudy days during the growing season, and the lowest air temperature in the beginning of the growing season. The abundance of field voles, Microtus agrestis, was measured as an estimate of prey availability in two years only. Adders grew faster in the year with the lower vole abundance, but with warmer temperature and less clouds. These results indicate that adverse weather conditions may limit individual growth rate in adders. presumably by preventing them from attaining body temperatures required for optimal foraging performance and growth. Although melanistic snakes have faster heating rates and higher body temperature than zig-zag snakes, growth rates did not differ significantly between colour morphs, but melanistic snakes grew slightly more slowly in four out of the five years. In male adders individual relative growth rates measured in different years were significantly correlated. In females the correlation was positive but not significant, nor did it differ significantly from the correlation in males. This result shows that despite environmentally induced yearly variation in growth rate some individuals always grow fast relative to other individuals in the population.

J	Meixner, T; Brown, A; Bales, RC				Meixner, T; Brown, A; Bales, RC			Importance of biogeochemical processes in modeling stream chemistry in two watersheds in the Sierra Nevada, California	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Two small (0.22 and 0.48 ha) alpine watersheds in the Sierra Nevada of California were studied during the 1992 and 1993 snowmelt seasons to evaluate the importance of soil properties and processes on chemical concentrations in the discharges from each watershed. Watershed 1 was surveyed as having 26% soil cover, whereas watershed 2 was 10% soil covered. Watershed 2 had greater H+ and nitrogen consumption than watershed 1 but similar cation and sulfate concentrations despite having one fourth the surveyed soil volume per unit area as watershed 1. Daily stream concentrations simulated with the Alpine Hydrochemical Model (AHM) matched the data well, after a systematic model calibration with a subset of the data. We found that the structure of the AHM and the hydrologic parameters developed for the nearby 1.2 km(2) Emerald Lake watershed could be applied to these watersheds with only small adjustments; chemical parameters required considerably more adjustment, reflecting a greater degree of chemical versus physical heterogeneity at this scale. Calibration for watershed 2 gave a higher percent base saturation (19 versus 4%) and lower stream P-CO2 (10(-3.1) versus 10(-2.6) atm) than for watershed 1 and three times the soil reactivity (expected) of a field survey. Areas mapped as exposed bedrock in the catchments apparently contributed cations and alkalinity to stream water to a greater extent than did neighboring areas of soil. Areas of exposed bedrock were a larger nitrogen sink than the adjoining areas of soil. The pH and acid-neutralizing capacity of surface runoff in both catchments were less sensitive to changes in atmospheric deposition than at the nearby Emerald Lake watershed. This decreased sensitivity was due to (1) a less pronounced ionic pulse, (2) less retention of sulfate in the soil, and (3) greater nitrate retention.

One of the models (Model I) is a monthly degree-day model, while another (Model II) is the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) model. The mixture of glacier runoff output from Model I and runoff over unglacierized areas calculated by Model II has a similar seasonal variation pattern as that estimated from data recorded at a downstream station. This suggests that glacier runoff is the main source (87%) of runoff inflow into the lake. A sensitivity analysis suggests that the water inflow to the lake is highly sensitive to an increase in air temperature. Runoff in May is predicted to sharply increase by 15% to more than two-fold if the air temperature increases by 1 to 7 degrees C, but it is predicted to increase only from 9% to 34% if the precipitation increases by 10% to 40%. The results suggested that the water inflow into Lake Gojal will not sharply rise even if there is heavy rain, and it needs to be in caution if the air temperature sharply increases. Analysis on long-term air temperature record indicates that the water inflow into the lake in May 2010 was probably less than average owing to the relatively low air temperature. Consequently, the flood outburst did not occur before the completion of the spillway on 29 May 2010.					zhang, shiqiang/JMP-5376-2023; Xu, Min/ACR-0682-2022														1674-487X	1867-111X				APR	2013	24	2					234	243		10.1007/s12583-013-0324-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12583-013-0324-3													WOS:000316973900008
J	Menz, G				Menz, G			Regionalization of precipitation models in East Africa using meteosat data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												The following article outlines the possibilities, prospects and limitations of estimating precipitation on the basis of high temporal resolution METEOSAT Real Time Window satellite data for the region of East Africa and the adjacent Indian Ocean. We regionalized the study area for both the typical dry season (September 1993) and the rainy season (April 1994) using two distinct precipitation models. These are the statistical METEOSAT Precipitation Index (MPI) model and the physical Convective Stratiform Technique (CST) model. The variation of input values for the respective models were first examined using the threshold temperature of cloud surfaces for the MPI model or the dividing straight line for the classification into either convective or stratiform clouds for the CST model. In addition, we discuss natural conditions of topography, land-water ratio and the interrelation between highland and lowland areas within the study area as well as climatic/geographic factors of air-mass transport and cloud systems and we evaluate the effects of these variables. By using regression analysis, the relationship between estimated MPI model index values and monthly precipitation is analysed for a maximum of 129 rainfall stations. Subsequent correlation coefficients vary between r=087 for September 1993 and r=0.49 for April 1994. For the physical CST model, the correlation coefficients reach values of 0.83 for September 1993 and 0.36 for April 1994. In addition, the study area was segmented on the basis of precipitation/climatological considerations. By using this procedure, we developed four subregions: 1) WEST, the area around Lake Victoria and the Kenyan highlands; 2) CENTER, the lowlands of northern and eastern Kenya; 3) EAST, the coastal area along the Indian Ocean; and 4) SEA, from the Indian Ocean coastline eastward to longitude 56 degrees E. Although this division leads to a dramatic improvement of the precipitation-index-relation within the WEST region for April 1994, it also results in a further reduction of the already weak values, as seen in the extremely dry core CENTER region during September 1993.

Turning eastward: New radiocarbon and stable isotopic data for Middle Holocene hunter-gatherers from Fofanovo, Trans-Baikal, Siberia	ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN ASIA												A considerable amount of bioarchaeological research - including AMS 14C dating and stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses (delta C-13 and delta N-15) - has been undertaken on the hunter-gatherers from the area west of Lake Baikal, known as Cis-Baikal. No such work has previously been reported for the east side of the lake, Trans Baikal. Here, we present new radiocarbon dates and isotopic results for twenty individuals from the Fofanovo cemetery, located along the Selenga River on the southeast coast of Lake Baikal. Once corrected for an old carbon effect using regression equations developed for Cis-Baikal, the radiocarbon results form 4 chronological clusters: 1) Late Mesolithic (LM), around 7950 cal BP (n = 3); 2) Late Neolithic (LN), between ca. 6000 and 5500 cal BP (n = 5); 3) LN to Early Bronze Age (EBA), between ca. 4900 and 4500 cal BP (n = 2); and the largest cluster 4) later EBA, around 3700 cal BP (n = 10). The LM Cluster 1 dates indicate that formal cemetery use in Trans-Baikal may have begun earlier than in Cis-Baikal. Clusters 2 and 3 reveal a previously unidentified LN component to the cemetery. Additionally, the EBA Cluster 4 appears to be largely synchronous with the EBA in Cis-Baikal. As a group, the Fofanovo individuals are isotopically distinct from the Middle-Holocene hunter-gatherers in the microregions of Cis-Baikal, exhibiting a combination of low delta C-13 values (-19.4 +/- 0.9 parts per thousand) but high delta N-15 values (15.2 +/- 0.8 parts per thousand). This likely reflects the distinctive isotopic ecology of the lower Selenga River, combined with use of aquatic resources from Lake Baikal itself. While further sampling is needed to test its robustness, a statistically significant difference between the LN (n = 6) and EBA (n = 11) was found, suggesting a greater reliance on the seasonal resources of the Selenga River during the EBA. Further analyses on these and other individuals from the cemetery are planned and will undoubtably provide additional insights into hunter-gatherer subsistence adaptations and dietary variation in Trans-Baikal, highlighting both differences and similarities with those of Cis-Baikal.

J	Lee, JY; Yi, SM; Kim, YP				Lee, JY; Yi, SM; Kim, YP			Size distributions and dry deposition fluxes of particulate polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at several sites in Korea in 1999	ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE												The atmospheric size distributions of particulate polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their deposition fluxes were measured at four sites in August and at three sites in November 1999, in Korea. The total ambient particulate PAHs concentrations at each site ranged between 6.7 and 128.7 ng m(-3). In November, the total PAHs concentrations at Inchon (IC) were the highest, followed by Yangsuri (YS) and Seoul (SE). This trend is contrary to the expectation that the total PAHs concentrations at IC and SE be higher than that at YS because IC and SE are highly industrialized large cities and YS is rural area. The size distributions of individual PAHs in IC and SE show trimodal in Dp <= 9 mu m while the particulate PAHs in YS were distributed evenly to fine- and coarse-size particles. These results suggest that YS has local sources in addition to transport of PAHs emitted from urban sources. The measured dry deposition fluxes of total PAHs ranged from 6.9 to 12.6 mu g m(-2) day(-1) in August, and from 5.9 to 8.5 mu g m(-2) day(-1) in November. Individual PAH fluxes were dominated by high molecular weight (MW) PAHs at all sampling sites in August. But dry deposition fluxes of low MW PAHs were higher than high MW PAHs at all sampling sites in November. This result indicates that major sources of ambient PAHs have seasonal variety. The Sehmel-Hodgson model was used to estimate dry deposition velocities as a function of particle size for the multistep deposition model calculation. The calculated fluxes agreed fairly well with the measured fluxes, and it was shown that large particles (Dp > 9 mu m) are more important than small particles (Dp > 9 mu m) in particulate dry deposition of PAHs.					; Kim, Yong/H-3109-2014	Yi, Seung-Muk/0000-0001-6333-4399; 													1092-8758	1557-9018				MAR-APR	2006	23	2					393	404		10.1089/ees.2006.23.393	http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/ees.2006.23.393													WOS:000236600700014

Concentration of bound nitrogen in rain is low compared with other European mountains, but the annual load lies in the middle range. Seasonal and local variation in the composition of rainwater mainly depends on the geographical origin of the storms. Catchment and in-lake processes introduce further variability: NH4+, which is at similar concentration to NO3- in the rain, is quickly oxidized or adsorbed in the catchment; aquatic macrophytes can either reduce mean NO3-concentration in lake water (Ranunculo-Potametum) or greatly increase it in sediment pore water (Isoetes); NO2- depends on pH; decomposition of particulate nitrogen in sediments changes with depth; lakes act as traps for dissolved inorganic nitrogen; changes in dissolved organic nitrogen suggest high microbial activities even in cold waters; melting period introduces most of the seasonal variability.

J	Klatt, PH; Nuechterlein, GL; Buitron, D				Klatt, PH; Nuechterlein, GL; Buitron, D			Frequency and distribution of behaviour of red-necked grebes breeding colonially and in classic territories	BEHAVIOUR												Over the two-year period, 1997 to 1998, nearly half of a population of over 200 red-necked grebes (Podiceps grisegena) breeding within a large lake (2,537 ha) in central Minnesota, chose to opportunistically nest in concentrated groups on large floating mats of cattail (Typha spp.). In this study, we examined how members of this typically territorial grebe species coped with living in a more social environment. The behaviour of pairs that nested close to conspecifics differed from that of solitary pairs throughout the nesting season. Colonial pairs tended to be less likely than solitary birds to leave their nest vacant and unguarded from competitors or predators. During the pre-nesting stage, colonial females and males spent more of their time in aggression than did solitary-nesting birds. However, after a pair established their nest and egg-laying began, female aggression declined dramatically in both colonial and solitary pairs. During the egg-laying period, females spent significantly more time on the nest than did males, while males were more active than females in nest defense. Throughout the incubation period, colonial males remained closer to the nest and their females than did solitary males. In general, birds nesting in close proximity exhibited a compressed use of the space surrounding their investments in the platform, mate, eggs, and even young, all of which may have become more vulnerable to competitors and predators in areas of higher aggregation. Examining how opportunistically colonial species adapt to breeding in close aggregations may provide insight into the early evolution of colonial nesting birds.																			0005-7959	1568-539X				MAR	2004	141		3				263	277		10.1163/156853904322981842	http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/156853904322981842													WOS:000220994500001

We also cultured material removed from the lumen of these same organs and from the mantle cavity to detect cellobiose-, cellulose- and chitin- degrading microbes. No true endosymbiotic fauna were observed attached to the surface of the digestive or mantle tissues of any species of unionid. Microbial growth on cellulose or chitin bacteriological media varied by season and habitat, but not by unionid species or source of the isolate. Lake unionids did not contain microbes capable of digesting cellulose or chitin, whereas unionids from the river site did in March and August, but not in December. Since these cultured cellulose and chitin-degrading bacteria were never found attached to any unionid tissues, they appeared to be transient forms, not true endosymbionts. Microbes capable of digesting cellobiose were found in every unionid collected in all seasons and habitats, but again, no microbes were directly observed attached to unionid tissues. If unionids, like most other invertebrates, lack digestive enzymes required to initiate primary bond breakage, then the lack of cellulolytic and chitinolytic endosymbionts would affect the ability to utilize cellulose or chitin foods. Thus, in captivity dry feeds based on corn, soybeans, or nauplii should be pre-digested to ensure maximum absorption of nutrients by unionids, The lack of cellulolytic or chitinolytic endosymbionts should not affect relocation success, though the seasonal role of transient microbes in unionid nutrition requires further investigation.																			0730-8000	1943-6319				JUN	2001	20	1					329	335																WOS:000171043000042

Biodiversity and seasonal distribution of benthic diatom assemblages as an indicator of water quality of small karstic river in Bosnia and Herzegovina	ACTA BOTANICA CROATICA												- The aims of this paper were to describe seasonal changes in the qualitative and quantitative composition of diatom taxa and the potential application of benthic diatoms for ecological status evaluation. Diatom indices (IPS and TI) were calculated from data from three different locations along a longitudinal profile of the Bunica, a small karstic river in Bosnia and Herzegovina. A total of 147 taxa were recorded in 12 samples. The most common taxa were Meridion circulare (Greville) C.Agardh and Ulnaria ulna (Nitzsch) Compere. Physical and chemical analyses showed low concentrations of nutrients, good oxygenation, typical pH for carbonate bed/origin and generally oligotrophic conditions and high ecological status. All sites had similar physico-chemical conditions and there were only few sea-sonal differences. Ordination of the diatom data showed that samples showed neither longitudinal nor seasonal pat- terns. Median value for IPS (16.8) and for TI (7.3) can be possible "expected" values for ecological status assessment for small karstic rivers in the Mediterranean region. We propose the use of the phytobenthos Intercalibration Common Metric (pICM - an index that combines the IPS and TI) as a national metric for countries developing WFD diatom methods at a late stage. One situation is described, and a solution, which is potentially transferable to other locations in Bosnia and Herzegovina and also to other countries facing similar challenges.

After that, an analysis based on the organization of three-way tables (STATICO) was applied to evaluate the relationships between phytoplankton genera and K-d at different OLCI bands. Our results indicate that phytoplankton genera are organized according to their ability to use light intensity and different spectral ranges of visible light (400 to 700 nm). As the light availability changes seasonally, the structure of phytoplankton changes as well. Some genera, such as Microcystis, are adapted to low light intensity at 550-650 nm, therefore high values of K-d in this range would indicate the dominance of Microcysts. Other genera, such as Aulacoseira, are highly adapted to harvesting blue-green light with higher intensity and probably grow in lakes with lower concentrations of colored dissolved organic matter that highly absorbs blue light (405-498). These findings are an important step to describing phytoplankton communities using orbital data in tropical freshwater floodplains. Furthermore, this approach can be used with biodiversity indexes to access phytoplankton diversity in these environments.					; Novo, Evlyn/AIB-5424-2022; Kraus, Cleber/M-1838-2016; Novo, Evlyn/M-6883-2016; Andrade, Daniel/ABA-6273-2020; Bonnet, Marie-Paule/J-6888-2016	Nunes Kraus, Cleber/0000-0002-5116-3681; Maciel, Daniel/0000-0003-4543-5908; Novo, Evlyn/0000-0002-1223-9276; Bonnet, Marie-Paule/0000-0002-3950-4041														2072-4292				OCT	2021	13	20							4114	10.3390/rs13204114	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13204114													WOS:000716261500001

These are the Bonneville cisco (Prosopium gemmiferum), Bonneville whitefish (P. spilonotus) and Bear Lake whitefish (P. abyssicola). Only P. gemmiferum can easily be distinguished from the other two by simple morphological characteristics. Until recently P. abyssicola and P. spilonotus could only be distinguished from each other because of the temporal differences in their spawning times or at total lengths greater than approximately 280 mm. Samples of the two whitefish were collected during their respective spawning seasons to verify the results of recent research which demonstrated that a combination of lateral line and above lateral line scale counts could be used to separate the species. Results indicated that R abyssicola and P. spilonotus could be positively separated using scale counts, and we suggest a modification of the recently published method regarding counting scales to determine whitefish identity to species. In 1999-2001, samples of whitefish were collected from standardized gillnetting to determine if any differences in life histories and diets were apparent. Significant differences existed between the diets and depth preferences of the two species. P. abyssicola were found in greater abundance in depths greater than 30 m and fed mainly on ostracods while P. spilonotus preferred depths less than 35 m, were omnivorous in their diets, and became picivorous at total lengths of 350 mm and greater.

Unionid clams comprised 80% of the total macroinvertebrate biomass and were excluded from initial analyses. The seasonal average size-spectrum for the littoral zone community was bimodal with peaks in the 8-16 and 256-512 mg weight-classes; size-spectra for the sublittoral and profundal communities were unimodal with peaks in the 8-16 and 16-32 mg weight classes, respectively. Slopes of the normalized size-spectra for the littoral, sublittoral, profundal, and whole-lake communities were not significantly different from -1.0, -1.0, 0.0, and -1.0, respectively. These results suggest that biomass is evenly distributed across logarithymically even size-classes for the average macroinvertebrate community in the litoral zone, sublittoral zone, and on a whole-lake basis. The biomass peak for unionids (16.4-32.8 g weight-class) was 10-30 times greater than biomass peaks for the remaining macroinvertebrates. The slopes of normalized size-spectra for the littoral zone and whole-lake were changed significantly when unionids were included; however unionids presumably play a minor role in the macroinvertebrate community because they are an energy sink in the present context. Despite wide seasonal variation, average normalized size-spectra based on samples collected at 4- and 6-wk intervals were very similar to those based on nine biweekly collections.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				SEP	1989	46	9					1510	1519		10.1139/f89-193	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f89-193													WOS:A1989AP88800007

Phosphorus runoff from Canadian agricultural land: A dataset for 30 experimental fields	DATA IN BRIEF												Phosphorus (P) runofffrom agricultural land plays a critical role in downstream water quality. This article summarizes P and sediment runoffdata for both snowmelt and rainfall runofffrom 30 arable fields in the Canadian provinces of Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario. The data were collected from 216 site-years of field experiments, with climates ranging from semi-arid to humid and a wide range of field management practices. In the article, mean annual and seasonal (in terms of snowmelt and rain) precipitation inputs, runoffdepths, and P and sediment concentrations and loads are presented, along with ranges of yearly values. In addition, information of field management and soil characteristics (e.g. soil type and soil Olsen P) is also presented for each field. The data have potential to be reused for national and international cross-region comparisons of P and sediment losses, constructing and validating decision-support models and tools for assessing and managing P losses in both snowmelt and rainfall runoff, and informing beneficial management practices to improve agricultural water quality.

J	HAVENS, KE				HAVENS, KE			CRUSTACEAN ZOOPLANKTON FOOD WEB STRUCTURE IN LAKES OF VARYING ACIDITY	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Crustacean zooplankton food web models were constructed for 25 softwater United States lakes of varying pH (4.7-7.2). Eight lakes on the North Mountain Plateau of Pennsylvania were sampled in 1987, and data from 17 Adirondack Mountain, NY, and White Mountain, NH, lakes were taken from Confer et al. (1983. Can. J. Fish. Aquat. Sci. 40: 36-42). In the most acidic lakes, the zooplankton food webs were simplified, with only two or three crustacean species; the highest pH lakes contained 6-10 species. Positive relationships were found between lake water pH and species richness, total number of predator-prey interactions, average number of interactions per species, and average generalization of predators. inverse relationships were found between pH and both the degree of omnivory and cannibalism in the webs, perhaps reflecting the adaptiveness of those feeding strategies under circumstances where energy flow from adjacent trophic levels is reduced. Reduced energy flow may limit the number of trophic levels in the most acidic lakes. Lakes of pH < 5 had only two or three modal trophic levels, while lakes of pH > 5 had three, four, or five levels.																			0706-652X					OCT	1991	48	10					1846	1852		10.1139/f91-218	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f91-218													WOS:A1991GL81400004

This paper examines long-term sediment and hydrometric data collected by the Water Resources Branch of Environment Canada in order to provide information on (1) typical particle size distributions of suspended sediment, (2) relationships between source material and particle size characteristics of suspended sediment, and (3) temporal variation in the particle size characteristics of suspended sediment from six southern Ontario rivers. Results illustrate the complex behaviour and variability of sediment particle size transport in these rivers and demonstrate the need for a better understanding of seasonal effects on sediment availability and conveyance processes in fluvial systems.																			0885-6087					APR-JUN	1992	6	2					189	198		10.1002/hyp.3360060207	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.3360060207													WOS:A1992HU13700006

The effects of two different invertebrate grazer guilds on the periphytic algal community were studied in a marsh pond in Manitoba, Canada over one entire open-water season. 2. Microcrustaceans (cladocerans, copepods, ostracods), which were numerically dominant in the unperturbed grazer community, effectively reduced the periphytic algal biomass to a persistent, depauperate residual assemblage throughout the season. 3. The perturbed grazer community, enclosed and treated with rotenone, was composed primarily of chironomids and oligochaetes. This community permitted a more diverse algal community to develop except when grazer numbers peaked. 4. When grazer numbers in the perturbed community were at a maximum, the algal assemblage appeared to be 'overgrazed'. Algal biomass was reduced below the minimum characteristic of the unperturbed community. 5. There was an inverse relationship between algal biomass and grazer numbers in both perturbed and unperturbed communities, but variation in degree of response was much greater in the perturbed system than in the unperturbed one.																			0046-5070					AUG	1991	26	1					87	96		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1991.tb00511.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1991.tb00511.x													WOS:A1991GL71100009
J	EYLES, N; CLAGUE, JJ				EYLES, N; CLAGUE, JJ			GLACIOLACUSTRINE SEDIMENTATION DURING ADVANCE AND RETREAT OF THE CORDILLERAN ICE-SHEET IN CENTRAL BRITISH-COLUMBIA	GEOGRAPHIE PHYSIQUE ET QUATERNAIRE												Thick (400+ m) and well exposed sediment fills in the Fraser and Chilcotin river valleys of central British Columbia record contrasting glaciolacustrine environments of at least two glaciations. The oldest glaciolacustrine sequence comprises deformed gravel, sand, mud, and diamict facies deposited, in part, on stagnant ice trapped in deep narrow valleys at the end of the penultimate glaciation (Early Wisconsinan or older). Younger glaciolacustrine sequences date from the advance and retreat phases of the Late Wisconsinan Fraser Glaciation (ca. 25-10 ka) and infill a Middle Wisconsinan drainage system cut across older sediments. The Late Wisconsinan advance sequence is dominated by diamict (debris-flow) facies that pass upward into silts. The diamict facies consist largely of reworked older Pleistocene drift and poorly lithified Cretaceous and Tertiary sediments. They record the focusing of large volumes of sediment into one or more glacial lakes occupying deep narrow troughs. Weakly bedded silts in the upper part of the sequence may have been deposited when the lake(s) deepened as glaciers continued to advance and thicken over the study area. It is possible that some advance glaciolacustrine sediments accumulated in subglacial water bodies. Late Wisconsinan deglacial lake sediments form a relatively thin, discontinuous capping in the area and conform to classical notions of glaciolacustrine sedimentation involving a seasonal or 'varved' regime. In contrast, no seasonal pattern of sedimentation can be identified in older sequences where the overriding influence on deposition has been the presence of steep subaqueous slopes, buried ice masses, and high sediment fluxes; these, in combination, caused near-continuous downslope movement and resedimentation.

J	Sikora, TD; Halverson, DM				Sikora, TD; Halverson, DM			Multiyear observations of cloud lines associated with the Chesapeake and Delaware Bays	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY												Satellite and corresponding near-surface in situ observations have been made of single- and dual-band cloud events [dubbed anomalous cloud lines (ACLs)] associated with the Chesapeake and Delaware Bays. A previous study developed the basis for two hypotheses concerning the mechanism responsible for ACLs. One explanation is that ACLs are forced in the same manner as Great Lakes lake-effect midlake cloud lines. An alternate explanation is that at least some ACLs are a special type of ship track that forms in statically unstable marine boundary layers. The time period examined in the current research is January 1997-December 2000. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer imagery served as the satellite dataset, and NOAA buoy 44009 and Coastal-Marine Automated Network station CHLV2 provided the in situ data. The findings from the satellite portion of this research show that ACLs associated with both the Chesapeake and Delaware Bays were observed on roughly 3% of the days examined and were more frequent during the onset of the cold season. The data also show that single- band ACLs were, in general, more frequent than dual-band ACLs. For the near-surface in situ portion of this research, the average ACL for both bays was associated with a negative air-sea temperature difference and a larger downbay wind component than cross-bay wind component. On a month-by-month basis, ACLs for both bays tended to be associated with abnormally large downbay wind speeds and negative air-sea temperature differences in comparison with the corresponding weighted monthly norms.																			0894-8763					AUG	2002	41	8					825	831		10.1175/1520-0450(2002)041<0825:MOOCLA>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0450(2002)041<0825:MOOCLA>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000177115600001
J	URABE, J				URABE, J			MIDSUMMER SUCCESSION OF ROTIFER PLANKTON IN A SHALLOW EUTROPHIC POND	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Temporal changes in the density of rotifer plankton were examined in a shallow eutrophic pond during July to September 1990, when abiotic environmental variables were relatively stable. In early July when Daphnia similis was abundant, rotifer populations remained at a low density. This is probably due to interference by the large cladoceran, because possible food was abundant and the rotifers showed high egg ratio. After late July, when the large cladoceran disappeared, a striking succession was found in the rotifer plankton. In late July, when Filinia longiseta and Conochilus dossuarius dominated, and in mid- to late September when F.opoliensis and Brachionus falcatus dominated, there was a causal relationship between the density and egg ratio, suggesting that temporal changes in rotifer density were regulated mainly by food abundance. However, in August, changes in the density of most rotifers were not necessarily related with those in the egg ratio. Brachionus angularis, B.forficula and Keratella spp. decreased or remained at a low density regardless of the egg ratio, when the population of Asplanchna brightwelli was developed. However, Polyarthra vulgaris, B.calyciflorus and H.intermedia increased or maintained a high density at this time. Stomach contents of A.brightwelli revealed that B.angularis, B.forficula and Keratella spp. were the preferred prey, whereas P. vulgaris, B.calyciflorus and H.intermedia were not. These results provide strong evidence that the structure of rotifer plankton can change strikingly within a season due to species-specific differences not only in diet, but also in the ability to escape predation, even if abiotic environmental variables are stable.

Coastal plain species occur primarily in infertile areas and/or on shorelines exposed to wave wash or seasonal flooding. Experiments show that coastal plain species are restricted to such areas by the inability to compete with competitively superior species that occupy fertile, undisturbed areas. Coastal plain plants almost always co-occur with either isoetids or carnivorous species, two well-known stress-tolerant groups of plants, indicating that coastal plain species are also stress tolerators. The rarity of coastal plain species is a consequence of limited habitat with low competition intensity, so conservation strategies should emphasize the preservation of remaining habitat and the maintenance of existing levels of infertility, flooding and exposure.																			0006-3207	1873-2917					1994	68	3					247	252		10.1016/0006-3207(94)90412-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0006-3207(94)90412-X													WOS:A1994NF94100006

Dolops ranarum (Branchiura), parasite of the body, mouth and gill chamber, infected mostly cichlids, the catfish Clarias gariepinus, Synodontis zambezensis and two Mormyrids. Among cichlids clear host preferences were shown. No seasonal variations could be detected in the infections. D. ranarum parasitized predominantly fish above 15 cm in standard length. Lamproglena monodi (Copepoda) parasitized only the gills of cichlids with a preference for Serranochromis codringtonii, S. macrocephalus and Tilapia rendalli. Small fish were seldom infected. Seasonal variations of the prevalence occurred, the hot season being the less favourable. Few other crustaceans were found during the survey: a single specimen of Lamproglena hemprichii on the gills of the tigerfish, Hydrocynus vittatus; three specimens of Afrolernaea longicollis, one found on the gills of Hippopotamyrus discorhynchus and two on the gills of Mormyrops deliciosus; a hundred of Ergasilus mirabilis in a specimen of H. discorhynchus.																			0018-8158					JUL 29	1994	287	3					233	242		10.1007/BF00006372	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00006372													WOS:A1994PD33500002

However, small waterbodies in Northwest Yunnan, one of the most concerned global biodiversity hot-spots, remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated the community structure of crustacean zooplankton and their relationships with limnological, morphometric and spatial variables in the highland small waterbodies in Northwest Yunnan in both the dry (October 2015) and rainy (June 2016) seasons. A total of 38 species of crustacean zooplankton were identified in our study, which is significantly higher than many other reported waterbodies in the Yunnan-Guizhou plateau as well as in the Yangtze River basin. This suggests that the highland small waterbodies are critical in maintaining regional zooplankton diversity in Northwest Yunnan. Meanwhile, we found limnological variables could explain most variation of crustacean zooplankton community, comparing to the morphometric and spatial variables in both the rainy and dry seasons. Our study revealed the diversity and community structure of crustacean zooplankton in the highland small waterbodies in Northwest Yunnan and highlighted the importance of small waterbodies in maintaining regional biodiversity.

This term dominated the heat budget of the stratified lake and would have caused large errors in calculated eddy diffusivities had it been ignored.

The tsetse flies were surveyed during two different seasons in 1988. Three different probes used each contained highly repetitive DNA sequences specific for a species or subspecies of trypanosomes of the Nanomonos subgenus. A fourth probe contained repetitive sequences common to trypanosome species of the Trypanozoon subgenus. Mixed mature or immature infections were detected in a variety of combinations in different individual tsetse flies. Such infections were detected in both the guts and mouthparts of some tsetse flies. Simultaneous natural infection of tsetse with the savannah type Typanosoma congolense and Kilifi type T. congolense, T. congolense and Trypanosoma brucei or T. congolense and Trypanosoma simiae were demonstrated. The probes have thus been used to demonstrate the presence in Lambwe Valley, south-western Kenya, of a type of T. congolense first observed among trypanosome isolates obtained from sentinel cattle exposed to natural infection on a ranch at Kilifi on the Kenya coast. this type of T. congolense appears not to be confined to the coastal region nor to any particular species of tsetse flies and may contribute significantly to livestock morbidity in other areas of eastern Africa. In the Kilifi area, T. congolense was found primarily in Glossina austeni; in Lambwe valley, it was found in Glossina pallidipes.					; Majiwa, Phelix/GQB-3948-2022	Majiwa, Phelix/0000-0001-6105-4107; 													0166-6851	1872-9428				MAY	1990	40	2					245	253		10.1016/0166-6851(90)90046-O	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0166-6851(90)90046-O								2362604					WOS:A1990DE61600010
J	HALFMAN, JD				HALFMAN, JD			WATER COLUMN CHARACTERISTICS FROM MODERN CTD DATA, LAKE MALAWI, AFRICA	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Conductivity, temperature, and dissolved oxygen profiles from Lake Malawi (Lake Nyasa), East Africa, provide a modem snapshot of water column characteristics during January, 1992. Temperature and dissolved oxygen concentration of the water column generally decrease with depth from over 28-degrees-C and over 80% saturation at the surface to just below 22.7-degrees-C and anoxic conditions deeper than 300 m. Specific conductance (kappa25) of the water column typically increases with depth from 258 muS cm-1 at the surface to 270 muS cm-1 at 690 m with approximately 50% of the increase between 160 and 240 m. The increase in salinity complements a decrease in temperature across the chemocline to restrict vertical mixing during the rainy, warm season, and salinity may be the only barrier to vertical mixing across the chemocline during the windy, cool season. However, fluctuating bottom-water temperatures, complied over the past 50 years from the deep-basin of the lake, suggest that cooler surface or near surface water is occasionally introduced into the monimolimnion. Conductivity profiles offshore of the Ruhuhu River show a mid-depth (30 - 65 m) layer of relatively fresh water (minimum of 213 muS cm-1) that is interpreted as an interflow injection of river discharge. The discharge introduces surface or near surface waters to deeper depths in the lake.																			0380-1330						1993	19	3					512	520		10.1016/S0380-1330(93)71237-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(93)71237-X													WOS:A1993MB67500003

Temperatures ranged from 15 to 23-degrees-C Total phosphorus and inorganic nitrogen showed a seasonal variation; highest values coincided with the rainy season (0.48 and 2.1 mg litre-1, respectively). Dissolved oxygen ranged from 2 to 7.9 mg litre-1 at the surface and from 0.6 to 7.3 mg litre-1 on the bottom, the lowest values being found in shallow zones. Average transparency varied from 0.62 to 1.4 m Secchi depth. Rainfall was a primary factor in seasonal variability as it influenced both physical and biological conditions by contributing to the transport and deposition of silt, which mixed with sinking algal cells. The composition of the surface phytoplankton segregated along five major divisions comprising a total of 49 species. General seasonal patterns of dominance alternated in a sequence beginning with Bacillariophyta, through Chlorophyta to Cyanophyta. Diatoms, the dominant group from February to early June, included Melosira granulata, Stephanodiscus sp., Synedra sp. and Fragilaria sp. During the rainy season (late June to September), Microcystis aeruginosa, Oscillatoria sp., Anabaena sp., Merismopedia sp., Crucigenia cuadrata, Oocystis lacustris, Selenastrum gracile, Mallomonas sp. and Tetraediella sp. were important.

J	SJOBERG, G				SJOBERG, G			FACTORS AFFECTING NEST DEFENSE IN FEMALE CANADA GEESE BRANTA-CANADENSIS	IBIS												The effect of various characteristics of Canada Goose Branta canadensis females and clutch size on their nest defence intensity during incubation was studied in the field during five nesting seasons. Nests were approached by a human, and the leaving distance was measured. Risk-taking in post-encounter behaviour was categorized at three levels. Nesting success was significantly associated with nest tenacity, a variable derived from leaving distance, but not with post-encounter behaviour. Nest tenacity, as well as post-encounter behaviour, differed significantly between individuals. Intensity of post-encounter behaviour, but not nest tenacity, increased with increasing age of the female. Nest tenacity, standardized over the incubation period, increased with increasing clutch size, but post-encounter behaviour intensity did not. None of the nest defence variables was correlated with the structural size of the female. Nest tenacity, but not post-encounter behaviour intensity, increased during incubation. Nest tenacity did not differ between early and late breeders, but post-encounter behaviour was more intense in late breeders. There was no evidence of positive reinforcement of nest defence through repeated visits. Nest defence did not differ between lakes, lake types or nest site types, nor was it affected by the distance to the nearest neighbouring nest. The results supported several of the predictions extracted from parental investment theory.																			0019-1019					APR	1994	136	2					129	135		10.1111/j.1474-919X.1994.tb01076.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1474-919X.1994.tb01076.x													WOS:A1994NH60000001

M.; Hoffmann, Maurice			Water table and species identity outweigh carbon and nitrogen availability in a softwater plant community	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Performance of aquatic macrophytes is driven by many environmental factors, and a major challenge is to understand how aquatic macrophyte communities are structured in various environments. In softwater lakes in Western Europe, hydrological state (submersed/emersed), carbon dioxide and ammonium levels and species interactions are considered as driving forces in structuring amphibious plant communities. In this study we aimed at evaluating the relative importance of these factors for four species in a competitive neighbourhood. Softwater lake habitat was simulated during one growing season in laboratory conditions, mimicking water level fluctuation, photoperiod and temperature. Artificial communities consisted of small populations of four softwater macrophyte species: Luronium natans, Baldellia ranunculoides ssp. repens, Eleocharis multicaulis and Hydrocotyle vulgaris. These communities were subjected to two levels of carbon dioxide and ammonium. Additionally, monocultures of Baldellia and Eleocharis were grown at a higher nutrient level combination in order to measure their competitive response in a community. Time (hydrological state) and species identity turned out to be the only consistently significant factors determining community composition. Plant performance was clearly species-dependent, while carbon dioxide and ammonium did not have major effects. The competitive response was significant in both Eleocharis and Baldellia. Competition intensity was highest in the emersed state. Carbon dioxide had a supplementary effect on the within-species performance in Luronium, Baldellia and Eleocharis, with high carbon dioxide level mainly resulting in more flowers and more stolons. Community outcomes and competitive responses in aquatic macrophytes appear difficult to predict, because of mixed life strategies and morphological and functional plasticity. We conclude that hydrological state was the only important environmental factor. The identity of the species that were present-implying species interactions-largely determined community outcome.

J	Clodman, S; Chisholm, W				Clodman, S; Chisholm, W			Lightning flash climatology in the southern Great Lakes region	ATMOSPHERE-OCEAN												We have made a preliminary study of cloud-to-ground lightning over southern Ontario and the adjoining Great Lakes region. The lightning data set, using magnetic direction finding, is sufficiently accurate to study lightning climatology. Cloud-to-ground flash totals have been found for the three warm seasons 1989-91. A large variation in flash total, lightning-day frequency and number of high flash density storms occurs over the area, with the maximum in southwestern Ontario. The area of the maximum also has a strong diurnal cycle and relatively few positive flashes. Several physical causes may contribute to this. Lake areas usually have slightly fewer flashes than nearby land areas and warm water usually has more flashes than cold water. The Great Lakes do produce more lightning than ocean areas. Convergence lines of lake breezes and other lake circulations can, however, be sites for storms with intense lightning. High surface temperature and moisture leads to an increase in lightning generation. Over land upslope flow increases lightning-producing storms and downslope flow decreases them. High flash density storms may be favoured by smooth rather than rough ground, and by open farmland rather than forest. On the other hand, there does not seem to be a clear urban effect increasing lightning in the Great Lakes area.

The daily uptake rates of ammonia, nitrate and urea nitrogen were 1.0 to 12.3, 0.0 to 1.1 and 0.1 to 1.3 mg N . m(-3) . day(-1) in the surface water of the three lakes. These values decreased with depth. The greater part of the nitrogen source for phytoplankton was ammonia. The contributions of nitrate, on the other hand, were almost negligible. The phytoplankton preferentially utilized ammonia and urea. The vertical profile of the total nitrogen uptake rate was somewhat similar to that of the daily photosynthetic carbon uptake rate. The primary production in both rainy and dry seasons was estimated as 340 and 160 mg C . m(-2) . day(-1) and 31 and 19 mg N . m(-2) . day(-1) in Lake Dom Helvecio, 150 and 73 mg C . m(-2) . day(-1) and 21 and 14 mg N . m(-2) . day(-1) in Lake Jacare, and 370 and 570 mg C . m(-2) . day(-1) and 53 and 63 mg N . m(-2) . day(-1) in Lake Carioca, respectively. A brief turnover time for ammonia and urea was obtained, whereas nitrate required longer periods. The present study indicates that the regenerated forms of nitrogenous nutrients play significant roles as nitrogen sources for phytoplankton and in the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle in the euphotic layer of the Rio Doce Valley Lakes.					; Barbosa, Francisco/M-6225-2019	Barbosa, Francisco Antonio/0000-0002-2026-6936; 													0003-9136					AUG	1995	134	2					179	194																WOS:A1995RP22000003
J	Nyberg, P				Nyberg, P			Biotic effects in planktonic crustacean communities in acidified Swedish forest lakes after liming	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												In Sweden, approximately 16 000 of a total of about 85 000 lakes have been acidified due to acidic deposition. Of these about 8000 have been treated with limestone powder in order to detoxify the acidified waters and protect sensitive fauna. The present study was performed in ten lakes in the southern part of the country. The lakes belong to four different catchments and were in different stages of acidification at the time of lime treatment. The composition of the zooplankton and fish communities also differed and three lakes were empty of fish at the beginning of the studies. Quantitative sampling of planktonic crustaceans was performed during the ice free season between 1976-87 in five of the lakes and between 1977-87 in the other five. After treatment the pH increased significantly in all lakes except one. The average number of crustacean taxa found per sampling occasion increased in all lakes. Increases were statistically significant in four of the lakes. In the lakes empty of fish, increased abundances of chaoborids inhibited, by predation, the increase of species richness. Species richness increased after the introduction of fish and the subsequent reduction of the chaoborids. At the end of the study, more taxa were found in the limed study lakes than in nontreated west coast lakes with an alkalinity of 0.04-0.10 meg L-1. Most species normally occurring in oligotrophic forest lakes were found. It was shown that the water quality after liming made the occurrence of sensitive species possible and that predation from fish and interactions within the zooplankton assemblage were of great importance to the species composition and structure of the zooplankton community.																			0049-6979	1573-2932				JAN	1998	101	1-4					257	288		10.1023/A:1004901320524	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1004901320524													WOS:000072339900016
J	Parparova, R; Yacobi, YZ				Parparova, R; Yacobi, YZ			Chelatable iron in the sub-tropical Lake Kinneret: Its seasonal variation and impact on carbon uptake by natural algal assemblages and monoalgal cultures	AQUATIC SCIENCES												The concentrations of chelatable iron in Lake Kinneret, defined as the fraction bound by 8-oxyquinoline (oxine) ranged in the euphotic zone between 0.24 and 2.36 mu g 1(-1). This iron species represented an average of 8.1 and 5.0% of dissolved ionic (Fe-i) and total iron (Fe-t), respectively. Removal of the chelatable iron by oxine additions to lake water samples reduced C-14 uptake by up to 87% of the control value. The impact of oxine addition was low when the lake phytoplankton was dominated by the dinoflagellate Peridinium gatunense and particularly high when the cyanophyte Aphanizomenon ovalisporum was the most abundant phytoplankton. The impact of oxine was most prominent near the water surface and declined with depth. Experiments showed that cultures of Peridinium and diatoms were significantly less sensitive to oxine iron binding than chlorophytes and cyanophytes, thus matching the findings with natural assemblages.																			1015-1621						1998	60	2					157	168		10.1007/s000270050032	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s000270050032													WOS:000073804200006

Samples were taken monthly (from May to November) at five depths (- 1 m to - 20 m) using artificial substrates. The results showed that both depth and season contributed to variations in the chironomid community. However, correspondence analysis clearly showed that most of the variation was due to bathymetric gradients. These results indicate that information on the depth distribution of the chironomid species may be useful in lake classification. However, this classification requires multiple-season sampling, so as to include the different lifecycle patterns of species.																			0018-8158						1998	374						169	180		10.1023/A:1017040209557	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017040209557													WOS:000076609900015

All three species were previously known within California from single localities. Two new localities for E. oregonus in Tuolumne County and in Humbolt County and 21 new localities for E. serratus in Lassen and Shasta Counties are presented. The E. oregonus localities represent substantial range extensions within California, while the E. serratus localities show a large number of populations within the surveyed area. In occupied pools, pH ranged from 5.5 to 9.0, conductivity from 30 to 150 mu S, turbidity (NTU) from 0.8 to 140.0 and total alkalinity from 68 to 128 mg l(-1). Pool size varied from small seasonal pools of a few meters in diameter to large seasonal lakes several kilometers across. Limited survey effort and successful "predator" avoidance by the shrimp may have contributed to the lack of distributional information for these species in California.

BULLETIN DE LA SOCIETE DE PATHOLOGIE EXOTIQUE												The south eastern part of the Republic of Niger was ecologically damaged by the dryness since 1971. Rainfall decreased by 30 to 40 % as compared to 1961-70 and lake Chad retreated 100 km to the south. Now it does not reach any more ?he Republic of Niger. Malaria studies have been carried out in urban and suburban places in Zinder and in the Diffa area at the extreme east. In Zinder parasitic indexes (PI) after the rainy season were around 30 % to 10 % according to he situation of the corner in respect with surface waters during the rains. in dry season the index feii to 3 %. In Diffa in a part of the city at high risk because lining the Komadougou river, Pi was only 6,7 % in October after the rains. Before 1970 Pi recorded in Niamey were up to 50 %. in Diffa area they were of 49 % in N'Guigmi and 32 % in Bosso, ecologically similar to Diffa. Obviously there was a sharp decrease of malaria which could be due to the disappearance of An. funestus after 1970. it was one of the main malaria vectors. its larvae were developing in pools remaining after the rains with heavy standing vegetation. These breeding sites have been destroyed by both dryness and human activities. Now the area has became hypoendemic and is suitable for epidemic because population has not much immunity A surveillance system for epidemic control should be settle.																			0037-9085					JUN	1997	90	2					101	104											9289244					WOS:A1997YC72700009

Any external N source to surface waters, therefore, is of importance in sustaining primary production. This study attempted to quantify riverine input of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) to the extreme northern end of Lake Tanganyika (surface = 900 km(2)) as well as the DIN uptake by surface phytoplankton. Results showed that riverine DIN inputs (1, 930 tons of N/year) were of similar importance to atmospheric deposition (1, 520 to 1, 720 tons of N/year) and were maximal during the dry season. Moreover, seasonal DIN variations in river and lake waters showed maximum concentrations during part of the dry season (May to July 1999) probably due to high atmospheric inputs. Phytoplanktonic nitrate and ammonium uptake rates were measured during nine cruises and varied from 0.01 to 19.3 nM/h. These values suggest that uptake by phytoplankton in the surface waters could represent a DIN sink of about 14,400 tons of N/year, thereby utilizing all available DIN coming in from external sources. External DIN sources represent approximately 25% of the annual phytoplankton N requirements, showing the major importance of unquantified N sources in sustaining primary production in the northern basin of Lake Tanganyika. These sources could include organic N present in the external sources, and internal N supply.					; Brion, Natacha/H-3565-2017; Baeyens, Willy/A-9366-2010	Tungaraza, Clavery/0000-0001-7708-7704; Baeyens, Willy/0000-0002-5281-903X; 													0380-1330						2006	32	3					553	564		10.3394/0380-1330(2006)32[553:INUARI]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3394/0380-1330(2006)32[553:INUARI]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000241299100013

The zooplankton of lake Golbasi consist mainly of Cladocera, Copepoda and Rotifera groups. A total of 27 species composed of 2 Cladocerans, 2 Copepoda and 23 rotifers were identified. During the 1-year study period, the most dominant group was Rotifera. The highest number of Rotifera were observed in second station in May, 2001. Although the species belonging to Copepoda were found, except in some months, Cladocera species were only observed in the first station, November 2001. Rotifera had the highest biomass in second station in May, 2001. Lake Golbasi has mesotrophic-eutrophic characteristics due to the seasonal distribution of zooplanktonic organisms. However, the lake has mesotrophic characteristics due to the eutrophication index value. As a result, it will be necessary to conduct further physical and chemical analyses of the lake water to obtain more detailed information about the trophic status of the lake.

J	Tilzer, MM; Stambler, N; Lovengreen, C				Tilzer, MM; Stambler, N; Lovengreen, C			The role of phytoplankton in determining the underwater light climate in Lake Constance	HYDROBIOLOGIA												At all seasons, the underwater light field of meso-eutrophic large (480 km(2)) deep (mean: 100 m) Lake Constance was studied in conjunction with the assessments of vertical distributions of phytoplankton chlorophyll concentrations. Vertical profiles of scalar, downwelling and upwelling fluxes of photosynthetically available radiation, as well as fluxes of spectral irradiance between 400 and 700 nm wavelength were measured. The overall transparency of the water for PAR is highly dependent on chlorophyll concentration. However, the spectral composition of underwater light is narrowing with water depth regardless of phytoplankton biomass. Green light is transmitted best, even at extremely low chlorophyll concentrations. This is explained by the selective absorption of blue light by dissolved organic substances and red light by the water molecules. Nevertheless, significant correlations were found between vertical attenuation coefficients of downwelling spectral irradiance and chlorophyll concentrations at all wavelengths. The slopes of the regression lines were used as estimates of chlorophyll-specific spectral vertical light attenuation coefficients (K-c(lambda)). The proportions of total upwelling relative to total downwelling irradiance (reflectance) increased with water depth, even when phytoplankton were homogeneously distributed over the water column. Under such conditions, reflectance of monochromatic light remained constant. Lower reflectance of PAR in shallow water is explained by smaller bandwidths of upwelling relative to downwelling light near the water surface. In deeper water, by contrast, the spectra of both upwelling and downwelling irradiance are narrowed to the most penetrating components in the green spectral range. Reflectance of PAR was significantly correlated with chlorophyll concentration and varied from similar to 1% and similar to 1-% at low and high phytoplankton biomass, respectively. Over the spectrum, reflectance exhibited a maximum in the green range. Moreover, in deeper layers, a red maximum was observed which is attributed to natural fluorescence by phytoplankton chlorophyll.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				DEC 15	1995	316	3					161	172		10.1007/BF00017434	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00017434													WOS:A1995TU90000001

Carbonyl sulfide (COS: up to 1.1 nM) and dimethyl sulfide (DMS: up to 11 nM) were present in surface waters during most of the ice-free season. Depth profiles showed accumulations below the mixed layer of methane thiol (MSH), DMS, and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS). There was no effect of low pH or increased [SO42-] (from 2.4 to 12.3 mg liter-1) on the concentrations and identities of surface-water VSCs. Accumulation of DMS below the mixed layer was 9 x higher in an acidified system, however, when compared to an unacidified reference lake. Estimates of flux from two stratified lakes indicated that volatilization was not an important sulfur loss mechanism compared to others such as sedimentary SO42- reduction. Concentrations of MSH, DMS, and DMDS in shallow Lakes 114 and 303 were often 5-30 x higher than in any other lake studied, and the flux from Lake 114 was approximately 0.96-1.6 x the estimated oceanic DMS flux per unit of area. On a regional basis, in areas where SO42- in precipitation is low, export of VSCs to the atmosphere from shallow lakes and bog pools may be significant compared to sulfur inputs through precipitation.

Sculpin food abundance (chironomid biomass) from the rocky littoral zone was compared with that from the deep water sediment zone. Distribution, size, growth, age, condition and relative abundance of sculpin were examined. Spatial distribution of sculpin was different between lake types, with more and larger sculpin found over the sediment zone in NoLT lakes. There were no seasonal patterns evident in this distribution and catch per unit effort was not significantly different between LT and NoLT lakes. Biomass of chironomids, the major food of the sculpin, was higher in the sediments than on the rocks, suggesting that sediments should be the preferred environment in the absence of piscivores. Longevity of sculpins varied between IV and VIII years and was not correlated with lake type. Sculpin size frequency distributions were shifted toward slightly larger fish in NoLT lakes. Sculpin growth curves and condition estimates did not reveal a difference between lake types, but comparison of mean ototlith interannular distances between lake types showed a trend, significant in year 4, toward more growth in no lake trout lakes. These results suggest that the presence of piscivores is an important factor limiting arctic slimy sculpin distribution and may act in concert with food supply to impact sculpin growth.																			0018-8158					SEP 21	1992	240	1-3					189	201		10.1007/BF00013460	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00013460													WOS:A1992JQ94000015
J	PRINS, HHT				PRINS, HHT			CONDITION CHANGES AND CHOICE OF SOCIAL-ENVIRONMENT IN AFRICAN BUFFALO BULLS	BEHAVIOUR												1. The social behaviour of the African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) was studied between 1981 and 1985 in Lake Manyara National Park, northern Tanzania. Emphasis is placed on the relationships between adult bulls (i.e. older than 7 yrs). 2. These bulls were transient members of the buffalo population of the study area. At any time .+-. 150 adult bulls were in the area. During the study period 240 individual bulls were recognized, and the number of the ''bull pool'' during this period was estimated to be 630. 3. Every few weeks, the bulls switched the herd state and bachelor state, and wandered from herd to herd, presumably in search of oestrus cows. 4. They did not form stable associations, and when bachelor, they preferentially associated in temporary groups of 3 to 5 bulls. 5. Adult bulls engaged in sparring and showed dominance interactions very rarely. In a dyadic encounter, dominance interactions were only observed between bulls of the same body condition. Encounters involving individuals in different condition resulted in dominance being established without interaction. Fighting is extremely rare and likely to be lethal to both opponents. 6. The switching between both social environments was relating to condition loss in the mixed herd and to condition gain in the bachelor state. This resulted in a ''rotating dominance hierarchy''. The bachelor phase is an essential part of the breeding cycle of an adult bull. 7.

J	Finston, TL				Finston, TL			Effect of a temporally heterogeneous environment on size and shape of the giant ostracods Mytilocypris (Ostracoda: Cyprididae) from Australian salt lakes	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												The giant ostracods Mytilocypris occupy temporary saline habitats in Australia and experience physical and chemical heterogeneity in association with evaporation. Three sympatric species, namely M. mytiloides, M. tasmanica chapmani, and M. minuta, show high genetic similarity and morphological boundaries that overlap. The large elongate, intermediate, and small blunt shells of the three species are associated with lakes of low, intermediate, and high salinity, respectively. The present study investigated whether all three phenotypes were produced through time in single habitats experiencing seasonal changes in physical and chemical properties. Three lakes at one site (Coorow) were temporally heterogeneous, showing a nearly 10-fold increase in salinity in a single season, whereas four lakes at a second site (Rottnest Island) were more or less permanent and showed less environmental variation. Successive generations in the lakes from Coorow became smaller and blunter in association with environmental changes, showing the range of phenotypes displayed in the three presumptive taxa. There was less phenotypic response in individuals from Rottnest Island, reflecting the relative homogeneity of the lakes. Possible mechanisms underlying the observed changes include phenotypic plasticity, genotype replacement, and strong selection.																			1323-1650						2004	55	5					499	507		10.1071/MF04009	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF04009													WOS:000223321700006

We compared the performance of larval saugeyes that were produced out of season with larvae produced during the regular spawning season using intensive rearing systems. Fertilized out-of-season and regular season saugeye eggs that were produced by crossing two Spirit Lake, Iowa, female walleyes and two Mississippi River male saugers were obtained from the Rathbun Hatchery, Iowa Department of Natural Resources, Moravia. Out-of-season spawning was induced by light and photoperiod manipulation. Eyed eggs were air-shipped overnight at 10degreesC. First-feeding larvae (19,000 fish/tank) were stocked in six 800-L cylindrical tanks provided with turbid water to prevent cannibalism and with surface sprays to secure swim bladder inflation. The fish were fed exclusively with commercial diets (Fry Feed Kyowa B-400 and B-700 and Bio-Oregon starter diet). The specific growth rate (SGR), condition factor, and survival were compared between saugeyes reared out of season (50 d) and during the regular season (39 d). The mean SGR and survival of saugeyes from the out-of-season experiment were significantly lower than those of saugeyes from the regular season experiment (P < 0.05), although the condition factor of the fish did not differ between the experiments. Significant differences in SGR were also observed between tank replicates, suggesting possible differences in the feeding responses of saugeyes within a tank system. Large discrepancies (40-43%) were observed between actual survival at the end of the rearing period and predicted survival based on counts of dead larvae siphoned from the tank bottom, suggesting the occurrence of cannibalism and the deterioration of larvae bodies prior to tank cleaning. The actual survival (12-19%) of larval saugeyes in both experiments shows some promise in the intensive rearing of saugeyes exclusively on dry feeds.

Rotary screw traps and beach seining surveys were used to assess distribution, abundance, and emigration patterns of fishes between 1997 and 2001. Both sampling methods revealed similar patterns in species composition. Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshazvytscha dominated seining (46%) and rotary screw trap (99%) catch by number. More than 80% of Chinook salmon captured were less than 50 mm, demonstrating that most Feather River Chinook salmon emigrate before smolting. In multiple linear regression models, Chinook salmon spawn timing (P < 0.001) and water temperature (P = 0.036) were statistically significant predictors of weekly Chinook salmon catch in the LFC, while Secchi depth was statistically significant (P = 0.007) for the HFC catch. Most steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss were captured in the LFC, particularly in 2001, which accounted for 82% of all steelhead collected. The total relative abundance of alien fishes was low, 7.2% and 0.1% from beach seining and rotary screw trap sampling, respectively. Alien fishes were more abundant in the HFC. Native fish species were found throughout the study area. Canonical correspondence analysis suggested that river kilometer, water temperature, and year were highly significant (P = 0.001), while season (P = 0.01) and flow (P = 0.01) were significant to observed fish assemblages within LFC. Water temperature, river kilometer, year, and season were highly significant (P = 0.001) to observed fish assemblages within the HFC. Our results demonstrate that native fishes can be successful in a regulated river environment, despite an unnatural flow regime. These findings provide valuable information in assessing the impacts of dam operations and in implementing river restoration actions by flow and water temperature manipulation.																			0892-2284		1-888569-59-X				2004	39						141	166																WOS:000189444700010

Both species performed 'nocturnal' DVM. The amplitude of DVM, however, became smaller from May to October. Such seasonal variations in DVM could not be explained by light penetration and/or water temperature. The two species had a clear feeding rhythm; they fed at night in May and October but also after sunrise in August. These feeding rhythms appeared to be related to the light-dark cycle, but were not necessarily associated with their DVM. We suggest that the diel feeding rhythm and DVM are regulated independently by light cues.

J	WEHR, JD				WEHR, JD			EXPERIMENTAL TESTS OF NUTRIENT LIMITATION IN FRESH-WATER PICOPLANKTON	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												On the basis of correlative studies, picoplankton in Calder Lake, New York, are apparently unaffected by seasonal fluxes in nutrient (N and P) levels. In this small eutrophic lake, picoplankton (< 2.0- to 0.2-.mu.m size) and nanoplankton (< 20 to > 2 .mu.m) predominate. Microplankton (> 20 .mu.m) are typically least important. Experiments were conducted in situ to test whether N, P or N/P ratios affect the predominance of these smaller organisms. Manipulations were run in 4-liter microcosms during June, July, and August 1988, corresponding to periods of increasing stratification and nutrient depletion. Following nutrient additions, phytoplankton were harvested and fractionated into three size classes. Microplankton and nanoplankton were significantly stimulated by both N (2.5 to 50 .mu.M) and P (1 to 20 .mu.M) additions. The severity of nutrient limitation was greatest during July. Picoplankton responded less strongly to N additions and were never P limited. These field data support laboratory studies which indicate that bacterium-sized phytoplankton use nutrients more efficiently and are superior competitors within mixed communities.																			0099-2240	1098-5336				JUN	1989	55	6					1605	1611		10.1128/AEM.55.6.1605-1611.1989	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.55.6.1605-1611.1989								16347953					WOS:A1989U959600048

Estimating Dynamic Adjustment in Commercial Fisheries	LAND ECONOMICS												This article combines bioeconomic theory and econometrics to develop a coupled model of fishing effort and stock dynamics. We apply the model to the lake whitefish fishery in the Great Lakes. The results provide support for the standard bioeconomic model of renewable resource exploitation in which fishing effort adjusts symmetrically with respect to profit and loss, but also that effort is affected by seasonal factors and drift. When we simulate the system for lake whitefish, we find that over the long run, effort adjusts slowly toward zero or a small recurring level.

This reservoir is used for irrigation in the Kastamonu Region in the North Central Region of Turkey. The study was conducted seasonally in 2009-2010. The distribution of Zn, Mn, Cr, and Ni metals between stations was statistically significant (p<0.05, p<0.01) while the only metal displaying significant differences between seasons was Cr (p<0.05). When the water quality classes were examined in terms of the measured metals and physico-chemical parameters, it was detected that the reservoir has a considerably high quality water and can be used as potable water in terms of these parameters.

Location of whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus (L.)) spawning grounds using Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra L.) spraints and prey remains	BIOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT OF COREGONID FISHES - 2011	Advances in Limnology				11th International Symposium on the Biology and Management of Coregonid Fishes	SEP 26-30, 2011	Mondsee, AUSTRIA	Austrian Acad Sci, Austrian Fed Minist Sci & Res, Prov Govt Upper Austria, Community Mondsee				The assessment of spawning grounds is frequently an objective of conservation management, but their locations remain scantily described for many lacustrine fish species. This study explored the use of whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus (L.)) scales in Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra L.) spraints and the remains of otter-predated fish to locate whitefish spawning grounds at two lakes (Ullswater and Haweswater) in the English Lake District, U.K. At Ullswater, regular spraint collections were made at a known whitefish spawning ground from the spawning season in February 2010 through to the end of the subsequent spawning season in March 2011. The frequency of spraints was several times higher during the spawning seasons and whitefish scales were almost entirely restricted to spraints collected during these periods. At the same time, motion-triggered infra-red cameras recorded otters bringing fish ashore to eat. More extensive searches around the shore of Ullswater during the spawning seasons of 2010 and 2011 found whitefish remains and high numbers of spraints in numerous other places. At nearby Haweswater, a survey of the lake's shore during the spawning season of 2010 found remains of otter-predated whitefish only at sites on the east shore, including an area adjacent to the only known whitefish spawning ground.

For seven sediments, total phosphorus (TP) varied from 531.9 to 1177.3 mg kg(-1) and inorganic phosphorus (Pi) was the main P fraction which accounting for 88.5 to 95.6% of TP, the concentrations of Po in different sediments changes significantly in contrast to Pi, the maximum is more than five times the minimum; The concentrations of TP, Pi and Po in sediments were all decreased from Yongding river to stabilization pond and to the inlets of the surface flow constructed wetlands, but increased along the wetland flow directions, it suggests that wetland mineral soils had a greater P retention capacity than organic soils and wetlands act as P (especially Pi) sinks during growing season; The content of Po in sediments has a approximately value in September and November but all Po fractions except labile Po showed significant seasonal variations, it indicates a significant Po cyclic process within the organic phosphorus fractions; There were significant and positive correlations between OM with TP, Pi, Po and P fractions except moderately labile Po, OM and P biogeochemical cycles were closely associated in sediments. This study indicates that the P-o in sediment play an importance role in wetland ecosystem and suggested more attention should be paid to Po in further research and management of constructed wetlands.

J	Wopfner, H; Diekmann, B				Wopfner, H; Diekmann, B			The late Palaeozoic Idusi formation of southwest Tanzania: A record of change from glacial to postglacial conditions	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES												The Idusi Formation forms the basal depositional unit of Karoo basins of southwestern Tanzania. It is defined as the rock unit limited by the unconformable contact with underlying Precambrian metamorphics and the base of the overlying, fluviatile Mpera Sandstone Member of the Mchuchuma Formation. The Idusi Formation is subdivided into the Lisimba Member, comprising diamictites, lutites with dropstones, slump masses and laminites, and the overlying Lilangu Member, consisting of black, pyritic and kerogenous lutites. The type section is at Idusi Gorge, situated 6 km east of Lake Nyasa on 10 degrees 17'50'' S. The thickness of the formation at the type section is 240 m, with the maximum observed thickness being 715 m. Plant fossils and palynological assemblages indicate an Asselian age, probably extending down into the Late Carboniferous. The basal diamictites contain striated and facetted clasts, which identify them as glacial deposits. They are mainly wash-out and slurried tillites and also, less frequently, lodgment tillites. These are overlain by proximal and distal deposits of proglacial lakes, which were laid down during the retreat of the glaciers. Laminates of the upper Lisimba Member demonstrate progressively stronger seasonal control. Further amelioration of the climate, with substantially increased biological production both on land and in the water, is demonstrated by the black lutites of the Lilangu Member. They represent euxinic lake sediments formed during the final deglaciation phase. Deposition of the overlying, coal-bearing Mchuchuma Formation occurred under a temperate climate. The duration of the Late Palaeozoic glaciation is estimated at about 20 to 25 Ma. The last quarter of this time span was characterized by climatic amelioration. Global warming was accompanied by an eustatic rise in sea level and a marked decrease in atmospheric CO2.

Samples were collected at different depths from the two lakes oil the same days, during each of the four seasons, and several physico-chemical variables (ternperature, light, pH, conductivity, sulfide, oxygen concentration, pigment concentrations, etc.) were measured. To fingerprint bacterial populations from each sample, DNA was extracted, bacterial 16S rRNA genes were amplified by PCR, and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses of the total bacterial 16S rDNAs were performed. Each 16S rDNA pool was independently digested with three restriction endonucleases (AluI, Hinfl, and Rsal) and sepa, rated electrophoretically. More restriction fragments were obtained from the Lake Vilar samples than from the Lake Ciso samples. Moreover, intrasample and intersample differences were observed in each lake. RFLP patterns were compared by scoring similarities using the Jaccard coefficient and then building a multidimensional scaling (MDS) map from the resulting similarities matrix. In both lakes, results indicated that seasonality was mostly responsible for the observed fluctuations in the RFLP patterns, while the effect of stratification was less pronounced.

Long-term resilience in microcrustacean communities despite environmental changes	ECOSPHERE												The ability of communities to withstand stress or maintain their species composition over extended periods of environmental changes is a matter of major concern. Here, we utilize a dataset where microcrustacean communities were related to water chemistry in 82 boreal-alpine lakes over a 50-yr time span (1968 and 2016), with the same person involved in sampling both times ensuring identical sites and sampling protocols. Over this time span, there has been a 1-2 degrees C increase in mean annual temperatures and prolonged growing seasons. Also, the strong changes in SO4 deposition and acidification, peaking in the early 1980s, followed by a recovery period, have caused not only an increase in pH but also a pronounced browning (elevated DOC) and reduced levels of Ca over the past three decades. Despite this, the microcrustacean diversity and community composition have remained remarkably stable, and this holds both for the species-rich larger, boreal sites and the species-poor alpine sites. While likely there are interannual fluctuations in species abundance, and perhaps species may also be missing for certain periods, a combination of local refugia, resting egg seed-banks and a regional recolonization that may occur at the meta-population level, aims at maintaining a strong stability in community composition.

Nevertheless, little is known about the microbiological characteristics of water in Lake Bunyonyi. This study was therefore undertaken to examine the spatial and temporal variations of faecal indicator bacteria (FIB) in relation to physicochemical parameters in Lake Bunyonyi. Result The FIB concentration was consistently measured during sampling months and correlated with each other showing the presumed human faecal pollution in the lake. The highest concentration values for E. coli (64.7 +/- 47.3 CFU/100 mL) and enterococci (24.6 +/- 32.4 CFU/100 mL were obtained in the station close to the Mugyera trading centre. On a temporal basis, the maximum values were recorded during the rainy season in October 2019 (70.7 +/- 56.5 CFU/100 mL for E. coli and 38.44 +/- 31.8 CFU/100 mL for enterococci. FIB did not differ significantly among the study stations (p > 0.05) but showed significant temporal variations among the months (p < 0.05) with concentrations being significantly high in wet season than dry season (U = 794, p < 0.0001 for E. coli; U = 993.5, p = 0.008 for enterococci). Spearman's rank correlation revealed that FIB concentrations were significantly positively correlated with turbidity and DO concentration levels (p < 0.05). Approximately 97.2% of the water samples had E. coli and enterococci concentrations levels below USEPA threshold for recreational waters. Likewise, 98.1 and 90.7% of samples recorded E. coli and enterococci counts exceeding the UNBS, APHA, WHO and EU threshold values for drinking water. Conclusion The FIB counts show that the Lake Bunyonyi water is bacteriologically unsuitable for drinking unless it is treated since the FIB pose health risks to consumers. Besides, the water can be used for recreational purposes.					; Lyimo, Thomas/ABC-1507-2020; Pamba, Siajali/ABE-5824-2020	Saturday, Alex/0000-0002-7230-6645; 													2523-3963	2523-3971				JUL	2021	3	7							697	10.1007/s42452-021-04684-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42452-021-04684-4								34131630					WOS:000692158600002

Zoobenthos of Lake Pyasino and the Rivers Flowing into It after the Diesel Spill of 2020	CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY												The species composition and quantitative characteristics of the zoobenthos in Lake Pyasino and rivers flowing into it after a diesel spill have been analyzed. The production of zoobenthos and potential production of benthivorous fish in Lake Pyasino have been calculated. A small number of zoobenthos species and low values of abundance and biomass are revealed. In the Bezymyanny Stream, the mouth of the Daldykan River, and the Ambarnaya River, oligochaetes Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri Claparede and Tubifex tubifex (O. F. Muller) dominate in the zoobenthos abundance and biomass. In Lake Pyasino and the Pyasina River outflow, larvae of caddis flies, chironomids, stoneflies, and amphipods prevail. In the area of the deepwater silted station of Lake Pyasino, oligochaetes L.hoffmeisteri develop, the proportion of which in the benthic fauna at this station (40 and 79% of the total biomass and abundance, respectively) is maximal. The amphipod Monoporeia affinis (Lindstrom) dominates in terms of biomass at this station. A decrease in the chironomid diversity, an increase in the proportion of polysaprobic oligochaetes, and lower values of the Shannon index in Lake Pyasino in 2020 when compared to 1992 are found. The low abundance (2181 +/- 2048 ind./m(2)) and biomass (2.01 +/- 1.85 g/m(2)) of zoobenthos in the lake results in low values of zoobenthos production and the potential production of benthivorous fish (3 kg/ha per season). Based on the state of zoobenthos, an improvement in water quality has been observed from river sections exposed to the oil spill to the lake and the source of the River Pyasina.

J	Frenette, JJ; Vincent, WF; Legendre, L; Nagata, T				Frenette, JJ; Vincent, WF; Legendre, L; Nagata, T			Size-dependent changes in phytoplankton C and N uptake in the dynamic mixed layer of Lake Biwa	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Short-term (days) hydrodynamic effects of wind-induced mixing on phytoplankton size structure, and C and N uptake characteristics, were studied in the surface mixed layer (epilimnion) of Lake Biwa (North Basin),before and during a period of high winds (typhoons). 2. The latter period was characterized by two major typhoon events associated with deepening of the seasonal thermocline, reduced water column stability, decreased underwater irradiance and increased dissolved reactive N and particulate P. 3. Nutrient concentrations, seston C/N ratios, and uptake rates indicated that phytoplankton biomass and production were limited by P and not N throughout the study. Higher C- and N-based productivity during the typhoon period than before reflected the increased phytoplankton biomass and higher specific uptake rates due to increased nutrient supply. 4. Changes in the size-structure of phytoplankton (< 2 and > 2 mu m) were associated with variations in the stratification and mixing regime. When vertical stability was high (before the typhoons) concentrations of > 2 mu m biomass (chlorophyll a, particulate organic C and N) were higher at the bottom of the mixed layer than at the surface whereas, when stability of the mixed layer was low (the typhoon period), the contribution of picoplankton (< 2 mu m) to total Chl a increased at the surface and decreased at the bottom following the first high winds. 5. Photoadaptive adjustments of the phytoplankton provided further evidence of hydrodynamic control. The lower intracellular Chl a concentrations and C and N uptake efficiencies in the < 2 mu m fraction suggest that they experienced, on average, higher irradiance than the larger cells because of their lower sinking rates. During the stability period, picoplankton exhibited higher photosynthetic efficiencies at the bottom of the mixed layer than at the surface. Such differences disappeared during the typhoon period indicating that the mixing rate was then probably higher than the photoacclimation rate in the small size fraction. 6. The present results stress the highly transient nature of biological homogeneity in the surface mixed layer of the lake.					; Vincent, Warwick/AAH-6152-2019	Vincent, Warwick/0000-0001-9055-1938; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				OCT	1996	36	2					221	236		10.1046/j.1365-2427.1996.00083.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.1996.00083.x													WOS:A1996VM61200001

Although the lake is shallow, rapidly flushed, and possesses only a thin layer of postglacial sediment (ca. 30 cm max.), 8% of the estimated 137Cs loading from atmospheric nuclear testing in the mid-1960s and13% of the potential standing crop of excess 210Pb were retained. A sediment column transport model including eddy diffusive mixing, advection, and resuspension, acceptably described the vertical distribution of these radionuclides as well as stable lead and implied that such efficient retention may be of recent origin, occurring with the onset of net sedimentaion about 100 yr ago. The model showed that, at selected sites, the history of lake loading by particle-associated contaminants can be reconstructed from sediment profiles. Horizontally averaged characteristics of the deposit indicate a surface mixed layer mass of 5 g .cntdot. cm-2 and tracer residence time of 3 yr in accord with residence times of surficial Hg, PCBs, and DDT. Trap-collected materials from two sites sow markedly contrasting seasonal variations in 137Cs activity reflecting differing proportions of particles derived from inflow (ca 300 mBq .cntdot. g-1) and resuspension (< 30 mBq.cntdot.g-1).

DIEL AND TEMPORAL ACTIVITY INDICATED BY FEEDING IN THE EASTERN MUSK TURTLE, STERNOTHERUS ODORATUS, AT REELFOOT LAKE, TENNESSEE	HERPETOLOGICAL CONSERVATION AND BIOLOGY												The time of day an organism is active affects the availability of resources and the potential competitors and predators it encounters. There is inconsistent information in the literature regarding the diel activity of the Eastern Musk Turtle, Sternotherus odoratus, with varying sources referring to the species as diurnal, nocturnal, and crepuscular. We investigated diel and temporal activity of S. odoratus in a roadside slough adjacent to Reelfoot Lake, Tennessee, USA, from September 2004 to November 2005 using baited deep-water crawfish nets. This active capture technique allows for precise times of activity to be determined based on feeding. In 29 sampling occasions, we captured 866 S. odoratus, comprising 655 individuals. Sternotherus odoratus showed generally crepuscular feeding habits, with a peak of feeding activity 0600-1100, and a less pronounced peak 1600-1900. Time of capture was not correlated with the sex or size of S. odoratus. Although some captures came at night, nocturnal feeding was not prevalent in this population. Sternotherus odoratus captures were affected by the time of initial net placement; 52% of total captures came within the first 3 h of setting the nets. The feeding season in 2005, based on dates of first (16 April) and last (19 November) captures was estimated to be 218 days.

J	SchmitterSoto, JJ; GamboaPerez, HC				SchmitterSoto, JJ; GamboaPerez, HC			Composition and distribution of continental fishes in southern Quintana Roo, Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												Composition and distribution of the continental ichthyofauna were studied in southern Quintana Roo and adyacent areas of Campeche and Belize, southeastern Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, on the basis of 69 sampled localities, as well as the published information and the fish collection carried out by the Zoology Museum at the Quintana Roo Research Center (MZ-CIQRO P). Fishing gear included 2- and 20-m-long seine nets, 1- and 3-m-wide throw nets, hook, spear, hand nets, and traps; we recorded parameters such as temperature, salinity and conductivity, transparency, depth, dissolved oxygen, bottom type and riparian vegetation. Most of the sites were visited in the rainy and the dry seasons. The inventory of continental fishes of Quintana Roo includes 85 species, 55 detected in the southern zone. Twelve are recorded for the first time in continental waters of the state: Anchoa colonensis, A. parva, Rhamdia laticauda, Atherinella sp., Strongylura timucu, Diapterus auratus, Eugerres plumieri, Stegastes leucostictus, Rivulus tenuis., Phallichthys fairweatheri, Xiphophorus helleri, and Stephonolepis hispidus. Cluster analysis allowed distinction of the following four local ichthyofaunas, sorted by decreasing distance to the coast: (1) Zohlaguna Plateau, some 250 masl, with relatively cool waters; (2) Hondo River and bordering water bodies, such as freshwater cenotes, wetlands, pools and creeks; (3) Center-Northeast Zone, including the brackish lake systems of Bacalar, Guerrero and Ubero, as well as the wetlands around the Bay of Chetumal and freshwater lakes such as Vallehermoso; and (4) Southern Caribbean coastal lagoons, where salinity varies regularly. Ichthyofauna (I) is characterized by the occurrence of X. helleri and Rhamdia guatemalensis and the frequency of Heterandria bimaculata and Poecilia petenensis; (2), by the frequency of primary fishes such as Hyphessobrycon compressus and Rhamdia laticauda, as well as Ophisternon aenigmaticum; (3) by peripheral fishes, such as Arius assimilis, Gobiomorus dormitor and Anchoa colonensis; (4), by a significatively greater richness, due to the dominance of marine fishes of the families Gerreidae, Lutjanidae, and others, which utilize mangroves as nursery or feeding grounds. Even though the fish distribution within the study area follows essentially ecological factors, the decrease in neotropical or primary fishes from Belize to Sian Ka'an shows the importance of historical factors on a slightly larger geographical scale.

Their total lipid content ranged from 3 to 9% during the year. The content of defatted dry substance was 14-17%; similar to the protein content of the other Baikalian cottoid fishes. The prespawning period was characterized by a positive lipid and protein balance In both species. Ln C. grewingki the liver performed largely a metabolic function, whereas in C. inermis it served also as a storage site for lipid reserves. During spawning, total body lipids of females of both species showed a two- to threefold decrease. Males of C. grewingki yarding nests deplete greatly their total body lipids, which decrease seven- to ninefold by the time of larval hatching in comparison with the prespawning period, and constitute 1-2%. After spawning, lipid reserves of C. grewingki were quickly restored to the initial level (from about 3 to 9%) and maintained during the long sexual maturation period. In C. inermis total body lipids increased only twofold in comparison to those observed during the spawning period.

Keratella cochlearis was the most abundant species accounting for over 40% of biomass followed by Polyarthra dolichoptera and Notholca acuminata. The mean standing crop for the rotiferan zooplankton increased in successive years (41, 51, 75 mg dwt m-2) as did production (1037, 1322, 1417 mg dwt m-2 y-1). The seasonal pattern of biomass expression and production varies markedly in different years. Instantaneous birth rates tend to be lower but more consistent for the more abundant species, instantaneous death rates show periods of negative mortality indicating an inadequacy of the model employed but explicable as hatching of resting eggs. K. cochlearis as the most successful species is explained as its perennial appearance and adaptation to the low annual temperature cycle found in the lough. The population succession and the annual occurrence of species differs in each year.																			0018-8158					OCT 23	1992	246	2					147	164		10.1007/BF00014702	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00014702													WOS:A1992KB68600007

In southern Hudson Bay, the marine invasion of the Tyrrell Sea at ca. 8000 BP, following the Lake Ojibway episode, was accompanied by the development of an Arctic-type microflora and microfauna indicative of a dense seasonal sea-ice cover and stratified water masses. Shortly after 8000 BP, the establishment of subarctic conditions in surface waters was accompanied by more intense homogenization of water masses. Subarctic conditions have persisted throughout most of the postglacial interval despite a recent surface-water cooling. In northern Hudson Bay, micropaleontological and lithological data reveal a succession of proximal to distal glaciomarine environments characterized by low biogenic productivity, harsh Arctic conditions, and stratified water masses. An increase in dinocyst abundance and diversity, after 6000 BP, indicates the establishment of cool subarctic conditions in surface waters, while foraminifer assemblages suggest intensified mixing of water masses. The micropaleontological records of northern and southern Hudson Bay reveal a strong latitudinal gradient in biogenic productivity and water mass characteristics throughout the postglacial interval. "Interglacial" conditions, established in southern Hudson Bay very shortly after it was invaded by the sea, seem to have occurred much later in northern Hudson Bay.					de Vernal, Anne/D-5602-2013; Hillaire-Marcel, Claude/H-1441-2012	de Vernal, Anne/0000-0001-5656-724X; Bilodeau, Guy/0000-0002-5419-9110; 													0008-4077	1480-3313				JUL	1990	27	7					946	963		10.1139/e90-098	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/e90-098													WOS:A1990DZ74900008

The majority of leks were in seasonally flooded or swampy forest, and most were situated around the borders of old ox-bow lakes. Males maintain loosely packed courts inside exploded leks or "quasi leks," which may extend for more than 1 km, Within leks, males vocalize throughout the day and occasionally perform two distinctly different solitary displays. One is a spectacular aerial performance that begins above the canopy. The "log display" is per formed just above ground- or water-level and consists of a series of short, ritualized jumps.																				1938-5129				FEB	2000	102	1					181	186		10.1650/0010-5422(2000)102[0181:SCTBSO]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1650/0010-5422(2000)102[0181:SCTBSO]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000085195300018
J	VONSTAMM, S				VONSTAMM, S			LINKED STOMATA AND PHOTOSYNTHESIS MODEL FOR CORYLUS-AVELLANA (HAZEL)	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												A combined stomata reaction and photosynthesis model was developed on the basis of gas exchange measurements from Corylus avellana in a hedgerow in the Bornhoved Lakes Region. The model includes two hierarchical levels. The ''basic model'' contains the mathematical equations which describe the different dependencies of stomatal reaction, assimilation, and respiration. These equations are fitted to the data sets measured during short time periods with respect to different phenological phases of Corylus avellana. This leads to the ''short-time'' parameters. The basic model consists of two submodels: The first submodel ''Stomatal Conductance'' describes the influence of vapour pressure difference between air and leaf (VPD) and irradiance (I) on the stomatal conductance. The second submodel ''CO2-Exchange'' simulates assimilation and respiration in dependence on temperature (T), irradiance (I), and the stomatal conductance (G). The latter is an output of the first submodel and links the two submodels. In the ''main model'' the seasonal, time-dependent alteration of the ''short-time'' parameters is formulated mathematically, resulting in further equations and the set of ''long-time'' parameters of the main model. Thus, the seasonal variation of stomatal reaction, assimilation, and respiration of sun-leaves of Corylus avellana is described.																			0304-3800	1872-7026				SEP	1994	75						345	357		10.1016/0304-3800(94)90031-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3800(94)90031-0													WOS:A1994PH55600030

A population of coccoid to ovate eukaryotic cells with a mean size of 1.2-mu-m dominated the RFPP community in both surface and deep water samples. Abundant prochlorophyte populations were not found in any samples. Comparisons of counts with epifluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry, revealed that RFPP were adequately enumerated with standard epifluorescence microscopy. These RFPP were significant contributors to total phototrophic picoplankton abundance in both lakes Michigan (24 %) and Huron (18 %), with maximum seasonal abundance during the May-June period (surface mixing layer temperatures, 3-9-degrees-C). During thermal stratification, maximum vertical abundance was found in the metalimnion/hypolimnion at the 1-5 % isolumes. RFPP were only minor contributors (1-7 %) to total primary production. Growth rates of RFPP measured with dilution and small inocula growth experiments ranged from 0.05-1.0 d-1. Microzooplankton grazing rates on RFPP measured with dilution experiments were similar to estimated growth rates, accounting for 52-280 % of growth on any given date.

By means of microbe counting, the analysis of trace metals in pore water and electronic acceptors for organic matter decomposing, we have found that strong biogeochemic l remobilization of trace metals occurred near the water-sediment interface. The microbial reduction of iron, manganese and sulfate took place in different parts throughout the sediment core with the extend of iron reduction lower than that of sulfate reduction, which happened in the surficial sediments and hampered the upward release of some trace metals to some extent. Some trace metals in pore water, due to the "dual releasing" effects caused by the reduction of Fe3+ and Mn4+ at varying depth, show a tendency of being enriched excessively in the upper 10 cm of sediment. In this study, we discussed the microbiological mechanism of trace metals enrichment in surficial sediments and the environmental condition, with an attempt to realize the unsteady mobilization of trace metals and their potential harm to overlying lake water in the Aha Lake, Guiyang.

Under natural conditions, the seedlings emerged from sand burial depths ranging from 0 to 11 cm, with a mean .+-. SD of 4.73 .+-. 1.82 cm. The frequency distribution of the depth of emergence of seedlings in the field was significantly skewed to the right and platykuritic. In the greenhouse, some seedlings emerged from a burial depth of as much as 16 cm. Although percent germination of seeds was not affected by sand burial, the percent emergence and the rate of emergence of seedlings were significantly reduced by excessive sand burial. Seedling mortality was found only among seedlings that emerged from sand burial depths of 10 cm or more. In the field, all the seedlings established in one growing season had originally emerged from sand burial depths of less than 12 cm. Within this burial range, seedlings from shallower burial depths had lower chances of establishment than expected, whereas those from deeper burial depths had higher probabilities of establishment than expected.																			0105-9327					FEB	1990	13	1					56	61																WOS:A1990CM92700007
J	Carrillo, P; Reche, I; CruzPizarro, L				Carrillo, P; Reche, I; CruzPizarro, L			Quantification of the phosphorus released by zooplankton in an oligotrophic lake (La Caldera, Spain): Regulating factors and adjustment to theoretical models	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Using an in situ approach, we have evaluated the phosphorus inputs from zooplankton in a high-mountain oligotrophic lake. Values of the specific gross release rate (SGRR) fluctuated between 0.2 and 2.9 mu g P mg(-1) dry weight h(-1), and were higher when the nauplii of Mixodiaptomus laciniatus dominated the zooplankton community. The rate of P recycling by the zooplankton was high, reaching 1.6 mu g P l(-1) day(-1), and showed a highly consistent seasonal pattern from one year to the next, with maxima in midsummer. Zooplankton size accounted for as much as 85% of the variance obtained in the measurements of the specific rate of P release, while other factors, such as the quality or quantity of food, did not significantly influence the SGRR changes. Among the models tested, only the one proposed by Peters (Int. Ver. Theor. Angew. Limnol. Verh., 19, 273-279, 1975) was useful for predictions in this system. The stoichiometric model of Hessen and Andersen (Arch. Hydrobiol., 35, 111-120, 1992), applied in this oligotrophic system, adequately predicted the phyto- and zooplankton dynamics, whereas the values of P release estimated using this model were far higher than the excretion rates obtained experimentally. These differences were related to the type of egestion (formation of faecal pellets) of metazooplankton and to the relative importance of the food resistance to digestion. We believe that in communities where copepods constitute a substantial percentage of the zooplankton, an evaluation of the P release which is readily available [soluble reactive phosphate (SRP), total dissolved phosphate (TDP)] to algae and bacteria would not fit the predictions of general models of mass balance; under these circumstances, assimilation efficiency proves to be the key parameter for predicting the readily available P (excreted P).

Sediment-water interface samples from the Great Lakes indicate that Pontoporeia densities are positively correlated with sediment concentrations of organic carbon, particularly in the upper depth range of the species. Pontoporeia is not found in anoxic sediments. Growth rates and production of Pontoporeia are influenced by the quality of food supplies and there appears to be a seasonal response to the down-flux of plankton detritus. Comparisons of numerations and distribution patterns also revealed an apparent positive relationship between Pontoporeia and sediment-associated bacteria. Interlake comparisons of population densities provide no clear evidence of any large scale impact by contaminated sediment on this species. Depending upon the extent to which organic carbon (OC) is assimilated in the water column, bottom sediments may store and buffer the quantity of OC available to Pontoporeia. Thus, if the annual down-flux of OC remains generally constant, populations of Pontoporeia should also remain constant unless influenced by changes in predation intensity. Numerations of Pontoporeia revealed that populations of this amphipod are much larger in Lake Michigan than in Lake Ontario. We suggest that much of this difference can be accounted for by different forms of predator-prey interaction near the base of the benthic food-web. Commercial fisheries data tend to support this idea. We also speculate that differences in the concentration of dissolved silica may figure prominantly among factors that affect Pontoporeia population densities.																			0018-8158					JUL 17	1992	235						321	352		10.1007/BF00026224	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00026224													WOS:A1992JM30800030

Artificial plants were serially incubated in the lake to simulate the age of natural leaves. The physiognomy of loosely attached epiphytes appeared similar on the two substrata. Algal cell number and biovolume were 15-fold and 17-fold higher, respectively, on artificial leaves early in the growing season, but total algal density gradually became similar on natural and artificial plants. In contrast, the taxonomic composition of loosely attached algae became increasingly distinct, and mean cell biovolume on natural leaves was twice that on artificial leaves. Adnate epiphytes on both substrata developed from sparse populations of bacteria on new leaves to a community of diatoms, blue-green algae and numerous bacteria on mature and senescent leaves. Adnate community succession on natural leaves in late senescence/death differed from that on artificial leaves colonized for comparable periods in having (1) a marked increase in filamentous blue-green algae, (2) a subsequent decrease in all algae, and (3) a final fungi-dominated stage. The trends in colonization indicate that macrophytes in this oligotrophic lake provided a distinct habitat from that of artificial substata for epiphytes throughout the growing season.																			0022-3646	1529-8817				MAR	1989	25	1					55	65		10.1111/j.0022-3646.1989.00055.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0022-3646.1989.00055.x													WOS:A1989T886600007

However, few studies evaluated the impacts on forests which had previously been distant from a water source and then happened to be near a dam's water. We compare forests with no dam interference with forests subject to damming impacts in two, four, fifteen and twenty years. We predicted many changes on the forest structure after years near a dam. Our goal was to demonstrate that a few years of proximity to the dams is sufficient to increase the richness, number of trees, basal area and diversity at the sectors located near the dam's water. The dam-affected forests were sampled in to two sectors, one near the lakeshore created by dams and one 50 m distant from the lakeshore. For the forest far from the dams the same procedure was used, however, the plots situated on the lower sector obviously had no dam water interference. For each sector we sampled 10 plots of 20x10 m and measure all trees with diameter at breast height with 4.77 cm or more. We compared the number of trees, tree basal area, richness, cumulative number of species, floristic similarity and performed species indicator analysis between all forest sectors. Sectors near dam water for 15 and 20 years are similar to each other and had more trees, basal area, richness, and/or had more species typical of riparian forests.

Studying the association between landscape features and owl assemblages is challenging due to the logistical difficulties of nocturnal fieldwork. We analyzed the association of landscape composition and spatial configuration of forest cover with the composition of the owl assemblages in a tropical rainforest in southeastern Mexico. During the 2014 reproductive season (April to June), we estimated owl abundance through auditory detection and playbacks at 60 survey points distributed in 12 landscapes (625 ha each) within a gradient of forest cover. We found that the owl community comprised six out of the 10 expected resident species. The landscape unit with 41% forest cover contained the most diverse assemblage. The owl species most susceptible to local extinction were specialists of interior areas of old-growth forest. The abundances of the Middle American Screech-Owl (Megascops guatemalae), Great Horned Owl (Bubo virginianus), and Black-and-white Owl (Ciccaba nigrolineata) were positively associated with the proportion of forest cover as well as with the average size of the patches, but negatively associated with environmental temperature. The abundances of the Barn Owl (Tyto alba) and Ferruginous Pygmy-Owl (Glaucidium brasilianum) were positively related to the amount of urban area in the landscape. The only species recorded along the entire gradient was the Mottled Owl (Ciccaba virgata), a species that is a generalist in habitat and diet; its abundance was positively related to the proportion of forest cover and the amount of water surface (lakes and rivers) in the landscape. Four resident species were not recorded: Crested Owl (Lophostrix cristata), Spectacled Owl (Pulsatrix perspicillata), Striped Owl (Pseudoscops clamator), and Central American Pygmy-Owl (Glaucidium griseiceps).					; Escalante, Patricia/B-8704-2014	Herrera Juarez, M.

This species has aquatic habits and it is distinguished by its large size, particularly by the length of its legs, reason for which it is captured for human consumption. Also, knowledge about its natural history is scarce and incomplete. In this study, we analyzed the composition of the diet of L. megapoda on the shore of Lake Chapala, the largest lake in Mexico. A total of 69 adult individuals were collected lifeless in fishing nets, during the rainy season (June-October), of which 48 had stomach contents. A total of 96 prey items were identified, which correspond to 13 prey categories. Fish constituted the most dominant prey category in the diet in terms of number, volume, frequency of occurrence, and relative importance. No significant differences were found in the consumption by prey type (aquatic or terrestrial). However, the aquatic preys had a greater relative importance and were more voluminous than the terrestrial ones. The diversity of prey categories, in terms of prey volume, indicates males may have a higher dietary diversity than females, but we not evaluated possible bias. In addition, a significant effect was found in the interaction of size (SVL) of frogs with the average of prey volume. Females (that are larger than males) consumed prey within a wide volume range and, the larger they are, more voluminous are prey. In this way it is possible that intraspecific competition for trophic resources in the environment is reduced. This study helps us understand the trophic ecology of L. megapoda, a frog species that plays an important role in the food web where it lives, as a predator feeding on aquatic and terrestrial organisms.

Some half-saturation constants for CO2 uptake were also estimated. The validity of the technique and interpretation is discussed and generally confirmed. Variation of the .**GRAPHIC**. compensation point of Hippuris vulgaris was related to the O2 concentration of the bathing medium, and seasonal changes in HCO3- compensation point were found in Potamogeton filiformis and in HCO3- and .**GRAPHIC**. compensation points in Elodea canadensis. The performance of these 2 macrophytes is probably affected more by seasonal changes in HCO3- compensation points than by .**GRAPHIC**. compensation points. The quotient of total C remaining at the end of a pH-drift experiment to the constant alkalinity of the solution (CT/Alk) was used as a measure of the uptake ability of a species. Ranked by this criterion, species showed a fairly continuous range in uptake ability with a nearly 15-fold difference between the most efficient (low quotient) and least efficient (high quotient) species. Although the uptake abilities of macrophytes and phytoplankters overlapped, the 4 most efficient C extractors were phytoplankters, and the 9 least efficient were macrophytes. Anabaena cylindrica, Microcystis aeruginosa and Scenedesmus quadricauda removed more than 90% of the available C compared with 70% for the most efficient macrophytes tested (Myriophyllum spicatum and Potamogeton perfoliatus). Those species which remove 5% or less of the available C are taken to be unable or poorly able to use HCO3-. Such macrophytes may benefit from: growing in unproductive lakes that do not experience C depletion; seasonal access to aerial CO2; high .**GRAPHIC**. concentrations in and close to the sediment. Competition for inorganic C may be an important factor determining the outcome of seasonal and longer-term changes in the species composition of productive freshwaters. The reduction or loss of submerged macrophytes in certain recently enriched lakes may result partly from C competition with phytoplankton.

J	MCGINLEY, MA				MCGINLEY, MA			WITHIN AND AMONG PLANT VARIATION IN SEED MASS AND PAPPUS SIZE IN TRAGOPOGON-DUBIOS	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE												Individual seed mass of two seed morphs of Tragopogon dubious (L.) varied among plants and within and among flowering heads within individual plants growing near Salt Lake City. UT. Seeds of the light morph from the center of a receptacle were smaller than outer seeds, suggesting that variation in seed mass within heads was due to position effects. The total seed mass per head, seed number per head, and mean seed mass per head of both morphs declined in most plants over the season. Heads with larger total seed mass contained larger seeds both within and between plants so seasonal patterns in seed mass may be influenced by seasonal variation in the amount of resources available for investment in seeds. Seeds of the light colored morph had a greater dispersal potential than seeds from the dark colored morph because their disk loading was lower. Pappus size (both pappus radius and stalk length) increased with the number of seeds per head which may increase the efficiency of packaging fruits on the receptacle. Heads with a large total seed mass allocated a smaller proportion of their resources to the dark seed morph which serve to decrease the level of sibling competition experienced by the less dispersing seed morph. Thus, variation in investment in offspring may arise as a combination of development constraints and selection for variable investiment.

This group is one of the dominant populations of denitrifying hyphomicrobia in the activated sludge of the sewage treatment plant Plon; The wastewater treatment process of this treatment plant can be characterized as a combination of simultaneous and intermittent nitrification and denitrification. Using this specific probe Hvu-1 (combined with the most-probable-number method and colony hybridization) the abundance of this denitrifying Hyphomicrobium population in activated sludge and in the adjacent receiving Lake Kleiner Ploner See was investigated as a subfraction of total facultatively anaerobic hyphomicrobia. A 15-month monitoring of the activated sludge and of the lake water was conducted to determine temporal variations of the occurrence of this specific population. During the sampling period total facultatively anaerobic hyphomicrobia remained very constant over a year (9 x 10(4) to 6 x 10(5) ml(-1)). The population of the denitrifying Hyphomicrobium DNA/DNA-hybridization group HG 27 amounted to approximately 30% of the total facultatively anaerobic hyphomicrobia found in the activated sludge. Significant correlations to environmental background parameters or seasonal variations of this population were nor found. Furthermore, this specific denitrifying Hyphomicrobium population has no importance for the lake ecosystem.																			0723-2020					JUN	1998	21	2					315	320		10.1016/S0723-2020(98)80039-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0723-2020(98)80039-8								9704116					WOS:000074998800019
J	CHEN, XY; BOWLER, JM; MAGEE, JW				CHEN, XY; BOWLER, JM; MAGEE, JW			AEOLIAN LANDSCAPES IN CENTRAL AUSTRALIA - GYPSIFEROUS AND QUARTZ DUNE ENVIRONMENTS FROM LAKE AMADEUS	SEDIMENTOLOGY												There are two different dune systems in central Australia; regional quartz dunefields and transverse gypsiferous dunes associated with playa lakes. These two systems, especially gypsiferous dunes at Lake Amadeus, the largest playa in central Australia, provide a sedimentary, geomorphological and environmental history of the region during the late Quaternary. The gypsifierous dunes consist of a surficial gypcrete overlying an aeolian sediment sequence below, a mixture of gypsum sand and quartz sand. No clay pellets have been found in the dune sequence, in significant contrast to the gypsiferous clay dunes in other parts of Australia. Three possible models of the environmental controls of gypsiferous dune formation are discussed. The most plausible one suggests simultaneous gypsum precipitation and deflation. Sand-sized gypsum was precipitated in a groundwater-seepage zone around the playa margin during seasonally high water-tables and these crystals were deflated onto land during dry intervals, forming the marginal gypsiferous dunes. These processes require conditions of high regional water-table, strong climatic seasonality and probably a windier and overall wetter climate. At least two separate gypsiferous-dune-forming episodes can be recognized. The age of formation of the younger one has been dated by thermoluminescence at 44-54 ka. The gypcrete crust capping the dunes is characterized by intergrown microcrystalline gypsum crystals, showing evidence of leaching, dissolution and recrystallization. It is interpreted as a pedogenic product formed during a stable period after accumulation of the gypsiferous dune. After the construction of the younger gypsiferous dune, there was a major episode of activation of regional quartz dunefields which formed thick quartz sand mantles overlying gypsiferous dunes on both playa margins and the dune islands within the playa. An equivalent aeolian sand layer was deposited within the playa. Soil structures in this unit indicate that the sand sheet over the playa was later colonized by vegetation. Activation of the regional dunefields suggests a major period of dry climate, which, although not dated, may correlate with the last glacial maximum identified as a period of maximum aridity from 25 to 18 ka at other sites in Australia.																			0037-0746					JUN	1991	38	3					519	538		10.1111/j.1365-3091.1991.tb00365.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3091.1991.tb00365.x													WOS:A1991FR90400008
J	VANDERMOLEN, DT				VANDERMOLEN, DT			A SIMPLE, DYNAMIC-MODEL FOR THE SIMULATION OF THE RELEASE OF PHOSPHORUS FROM SEDIMENTS IN SHALLOW, EUTROPHIC SYSTEMS	WATER RESEARCH												SED is a dynamic model describing the release of phosphorus from sediments in shallow, eutrophic lakes. The model includes only three state-variables (dissolved and organic particulate phosphorus, active sediment layer), simple relationships between the variables and a restricted number of parameters. Besides, the diffusive transport of dissolved phosphorus to the overlying water, mineralization of organic phosphorus in the sediment and ad-desorption and fixation of inorganic phosphorus are described. The model solves the differential equations for organic phosphorus and dissolved inorganic phosphorus in the sediments analytically; the calculation time step is 1 day. The use of one active layer, with a variable thickness between the aerobic zone and the layer subject to turbation, and the concept of coupling inorganic processes to mineralization results in a relative simple model structure. Calibration is performed with data sets of the shallow Lake Veluwe, The Netherlands. SED is capable of reproducing phosphorus retention in Lake Veluwe and yields realistic values for the net phosphorus release from the sediment, both in magnitude and in seasonal pattern. The change in external loading resulted in a significant decrease of retention and release.																			0043-1354	1879-2448				JUN	1991	25	6					737	744		10.1016/0043-1354(91)90049-V	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(91)90049-V													WOS:A1991FP90200013

CYBIUM												Based on 195 samples from the Bia River (Ivory Coast-Ghana) on which a hydro-electric dam was built in 1959, the diet of Mormyrops anguilloides was studied in relation to fish size, locality and season. A feeding index was computed by combining the occurrence and weight percentages of the items identified in the stomach contents. In the lacustrine environment, M. anguilloides mainly fed on fish, especially on tilapias (Cichlidae) Sarotherodon melanotheron and Tilapia spp., whereas in riverine localities two groups of preys (Crustacea and fish) were mainly eaten. This dietary shift is statistically significant. In the lake, the dirt varied significantly with size; young fishes preyed on benthic invertebrates, mostly aquatic insects whereas larger fishes were exclusively piscivorous. Significant variation in the diet was observed between seasonal samples examined from the lacustrine environment.																			0399-0974						2000	24	1					67	79																WOS:000086964900005

This study examines how Ca(OH)(2) treatment affects the survival of Hyalella azteca and larvae of Chironomus spp. in laboratory microcosms and the abundance and seasonal dynamics of macroinvertebrates in two eutrophic hardwater lakes. Macroinvertebrate data for three reference lakes sampled during the same time period are also presented. Additions of 225 and 295 g Ca(OH)(2).m(-2) (74 and 107 mg.L-1) to two lakes resulted in lake water pH remaining within its natural range (< 10) and had no discernable effects on macroinvertebrate density or biomass up to 2 years after treatment. Macroinvertebrate response to Ca(OH)(2) in hardwater lakes differed markedly from results reported for softwater lakes. After 4 days, no detectable influence was observed on survivorship of Chironomus spp. with laboratory dosages of 0-300 g Ca(OH)(2).m(-2) (0-1781 mg.L-1), but survivorship of H. azteca was reduced by greater than or equal to 50% at dosages that raised water pH to greater than or equal to 10 (300 g Ca(OH)(2).m(-2)). The sensitivity of H. azteca, but not Chironomus spp., could be a result of singular or combined effects of Ca(OH)(2) levels, precipitate, or changes in pH. It may also reflect the greater dependence of H. azteca than Chironomus spp on the water above, rather than below, the sediment-water interface.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				JAN	2000	57	1					125	136		10.1139/cjfas-57-1-125	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-57-1-125													WOS:000084870600014

A multiproxy approach was applied to a 14 000 yr-long sediment record from Lake Kimilili, Mt Elgon (4150 in asl), to evaluate the impact of these atmospheric factors on the carbon cycle in the coupled lake-catchment ecosystem. Changes in the delta(13)C values of bulk organic matter reflect variations in terrestrial and aquatic productivity, as well as in the proportions of C-3 and C-4 terrestrial detritus. During the cold, dry, late-glacial interval, a low C/N ratio, an enhanced diatom-carbon influx, bulk delta(13)C values as high as 7parts per thousand and exceptionally heavy delta(13)C values in algal biomarkers (up to 0parts per thousand) demonstrate that the sedimentary carbon originated mainly from benthic diatoms assimilating HCO3- under conditions of acute carbon limitation. The high-altitude vegetation was a sparse grassland containing significant C-4 elements. From 12.2 ka onwards, the influxes of C-3 terrestrial plant detritus and Afroalpine shrub pollen slowly increased as the climate became warmer and wetter, culminating similar to6.2 - 4 ka when bulk delta(13)C values reached a minimum. Drier conditions and enhanced nutrient inputs during the late Holocene stimulated renewed diatom productivity centred on 3.5 ka. After 2.1 ka the lake shallowed, with marked seasonal fluctuations. We conclude that changes in ambient pCO(2) were less important than climate in controlling late-glacial to Holocene variations in carbon cycling in this alpine ecosystem.

Temperature seemed very important in conditioning the presence of the species: in fact, water temperature of over 20 C seemed to be out of its tolerance range. Seasonal variations of total glutathione, glutathione-dependent enzymes (glutathione-S-transferases glutathione peroxidases, glutathione reductase, glyoxalase I and glyoxalase II) and catalase were studied. The results suggest the existence of an annual cyclic path for glutathione-dependent enzyme activities. The progress of this biochemical pattern could be considered a useful tool for characterising seasonal variations in the metabolic status of these organisms.

The combined effects of the Sahelian drought and the partial conversion of flood flows to dry-season releases by Tiga Dam reservoir has decreased the contribution from the Hadejia to the Komadugu-Yobe River since 1974. Blockages by weed growth and siltation in the Hadejia have also jointly contributed to the decline in river flow. The change in the flood regime has directly impacted certain components of the Yobe basin ecosystems including plant and fish species diversity and quality. A certain minimum flood extent is required in the Jama'are and Hadejia rivers to sustain their rich wetland ecosystems at reasonable level, particularly areas of high biodiversity such as the Dagona water fowl sanctuary, the Gorgoram forest reserve and the fish resources.																			0144-7815		1-901502-41-4				2001		266					101	111																WOS:000172971500010
J	Urban, NR; Sampson, CJ; Brezonik, PL; Baker, LA				Urban, NR; Sampson, CJ; Brezonik, PL; Baker, LA			Sulfur cycling in the water column of Little Rock Lake, Wisconsin	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												The S cycle in the water column of a small, soft-water lake was studied for 9 years as part of an experimental study of the effects of acid rain on lakes. The two basins of the lake were artificially separated, and one basin was experimentally acidified with sulfuric acid while the other served as a reference or control. Spatial and seasonal patterns of sulfate uptake by plankton (53-70 mmol m(-2) yr(-) (1)), deposition of sulfur to sediments in settling seston (53 mmol m(-2) yr(-1)), and sulfate diffusion (0-39 mmol m(-2) yr(-) 1) into sediments were examined. Measurements of inputs (12-108 mmol m(-2) yr(-1)) and outputs (5.5-25 mmol m(-2) yr(-) 1) allowed construction of a mass balance that was then compared with rates of S accumulation in sediments cores (10-28 mmol m(-2) yr(-1)) and measured fluxes of S into the sediments. Because of the low SO42- concentrations (mu mole L-1) in the lake, annual uptake by plankton (53-70 mmol m(-2) yr(-1)) represented a large fraction (> 50%) of the SO42- inventory in the lake. Despite this large flux through the plankton, only small seasonal fluctuations in SO42- concentrations (mu mole L(-)1) were observed; rapid mineralization of organic matter (half-life <3 months) prevented sulfate depletion in the water column. The turnover time for sulfate in the water column is only 1.4 yr; much less than the 11-yr turnover time of a conservative ion in this seepage lake. Sulfate diffusion into and reduction in the sediments (0-160 mu mole m(-2) d(-1)) caused SO42- depletion in the hypolimnion. Modeling of seasonal changes in lake-water SO42- concentrations indicated that only 30-50% of the diffusive flux of sulfate to the sediments was permanently incorporated in solid phases, and about 15% of sulfur in settling seston was buried in the sediments. The utility of sulfur mass balances for seepage lakes would be enhanced if uncertainty about the deposition velocity for both sulfate aerosols and SO2, uncertainty in calculation of a lake-wide rate of S accumulation in sediments, and uncertainty in the measured diffusive fluxes could be further constrained.					; Brezonik, Patrick/ISV-2988-2023	Urban, Noel/0000-0002-3586-0399; 													0168-2563					JAN	2001	52	1					41	77		10.1023/A:1026505717561	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1026505717561													WOS:000165966200003
J	CARTER, V; RYBICKI, NB				CARTER, V; RYBICKI, NB			LIGHT ATTENUATION AND SUBMERSED MACROPHYTE DISTRIBUTION IN THE TIDAL POTOMAC RIVER AND ESTUARY	ESTUARIES												Changing light availability may be responsible for the discontinuous distribution of submersed aquatic macrophytes in the freshwater tidal Potomac River. During the 1985-1986 growing seasons, light attenuation and chlorophyll a and suspended particulate material concentrations were measured in an unvegetated reach (B) and in two adjacent vegetated reaches (A and C). Light attenuation in reach B (the lower, fresh to oligohaline tidal river) was greater than that in reach A (the recently revegetated, upper, freshwater tidal river) in both years. Reach B light attenuation was greater than that in reach C (the vegetated, oligohaline to mesohaline transition zone of the Potomac Estuary) in 1985 and similar to that in reach C in 1986. In reach B, 5% of total below-surface light penetrated only an average of 1.3 m in 1985 and 1.0 m in 1986, compared with 1.9 m and 1.4 m in reach A in 1985 and 1986, respectively. Water column chlorophyll a concentration controlled light availability in reaches A and B in 1985, whereas both chlorophyll a and suspended particulate material concentrations were highly correlated with attenuation in both reaches in 1986. Reach C light attenuation was correlated with suspended particulate material in 1986. The relationship between attenuation coefficient and Secchi depth was K(PAR) = 1.38/Secchi depth. The spectral distribution of light at 1 m was shifted toward the red portion of the visible spectrum compared to surface light. Blue light was virtually absent at 1.0 m in reach B during July and August 1986. Tidal range is probably an important factor in determining light availability for submersed macrophyte propagule survival at the sediment-water interface in this shallow turbid system.						rybicki, nancy/0000-0002-2205-7927													0160-8347					DEC	1990	13	4					441	452		10.2307/1351788	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1351788													WOS:A1990ET54800009

To investigate the impact of particulate sedimentation on P changes in reservoir water, runoff samples were collected at four locations in the upstream channels of two reservoirs after a rainstorm. Two batches of particulate sedimentation simulations were conducted separately in four plexiglass columns to analyze the changes of water P and environmental factors during particulate sedimentation. The results showed that the contents of total P (TP), total particulates P (TPP), and phosphate (PO43-) decreased with the settlement of particulates. The correlation between the environmental factors and the amount of PO43- in water changed from uncorrelated to correlated with particulate settlement, implying that the rapid settling of particulates might weaken the effect of environmental factors on P exchange between water and particulates. Particulates firstly release PO43- rapidly in river or reservoir and then adsorb PO43- slowly during settlement in reservoirs. Coarse particulates release more and adsorb less PO43- during settlement, and fine particulates play an important role in the removal of water PO43- due to the slow sedimentation rates. Therefore, to mitigate the reactive P content of reservoir water, the loss of coarse particulates from the watershed should be controlled, and the discharge of water with particulates downstream should also be avoided during the flood season.

Detection of regional acidification trends	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												The Temporally Integrated Monitoring of Ecosystems (TIME) project utilizes a hybrid sampling approach to achieve its goal of assessing whether emissions controls, mandated by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, have had their intended effect on lakes and streams. A randomly placed triangular grid is used to select, with known probability, lakes and streams for sampling on either an annual basis (in the case of acid-sensitive sites) or on a 4-year rotation. Data from these sites will be used to detect trends in regional characteristics of the target populations. The ability of TIME to detect trends in acid-neutralizing capacity (ANC) and SO42- is dependent on the amount of variability (year-to-year, site-to-site, within-season, and site-by-year interaction) exhibited by the sites. In particular, high levels of year-to-year variability lead to very low power to detect trends. One method to minimize year-to-year variability is to group together sites with similar characteristics. By performing trends tests on seven separate subpopulations the TIME design for northeastern U.S. lakes is predicted to bs able to detect trends of the expected magnitudes in ANC (0.5 mu eq L(-1) yr(-1)) and SO42- (1.2 mu eq L(-1) yr(-1)) with power at or above the 0.90 level and alpha = 0.10.

Transformation of Radiocesium Speciation in Ponds at the Vicinity of Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant and Dynamics of Its Distribution in Sediment-Water System	RUSSIAN METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY												The paper is concerned with the results of Cs-137 monitoring in the irrigation ponds of the Okuma town in the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) exclusion zone. The 137Cs activity concentrations in the ponds appeared to be higher than those in the rivers and dam reservoirs in the region. The study has revealed a trend for a decline in Cs-137 activity concentrations, both particulate and dissolved. The rate of particulate Cs-137 decline was much higher than that of dissolved. The total distribution coefficient Kd (Cs-137) in the suspended sediment-water system in the studied ponds was decreasing in time with the rate constant of 0.12-0.18 year(-1). Assuming that the decrease in Kd is associated with decomposition of hot glassy particles, the time scale of Cs-137 leaching from them in these water bodies was estimated to be 5-8 years. These estimates are consistent with the findings of recent laboratory experiments on the subject. With respect to seasonal variations, the highest levels of dissolved Cs-137 in the studied ponds were observed from June to October as a function of specific pond and monitoring year. Based on data about Cs-137 speciation in the bottom sediment top layer of the ponds and its distri-bution in the sediment-water system, the exchangeable radiocesium interception potential RIPex(K) for the ponds sediments was estimated to be 1650-2250 mg-eq/kg, which is within the range of values measured by laboratory studies.

The tributaries of Lake Pleshcheyevo show distinct seasonal dynamics of organic matter concentration, and its dependence on the character of stream recharge. The heterogeneity of the character of relief and the geological structure of Lake Pleshcheyevo drainage basin, as well as the anthropogenic impact cause a difference between the chemical composition of dissolved substances in the tributaries. In the Tadenka R., in addition to the natural factors of organic matter formation, labile organic matter of zoogenic origin was found to enter the river water. The anomalously hot weather and the acute deficiency of precipitation during the vegetation period of 2010 had their effect on the hydrochemical regime of the river.

Texture and organic matter content of surface sediments from Metztitlan Lake, Mexico	HIDROBIOLOGICA												Background: Texture and organic matter content of the surface sediments of aquatic ecosystems provide important information about the nature of the sedimentary processes that occur there also to exerting a notable influence on the supply of nutrients in the water column and on the composition and distribution of benthic biota. Goals: Due to the lack of antecedents, in this study an evaluation of the textural characteristics and organic matter content of the surface sediments of Lake Metztitlan was carried out. Methods: Sediment samples (n= 35) were collected in the dry and rainy season for 2 years. The granulometric analysis was carried out using sieving and pipetting techniques. The content of organic matter (OM) was determined by the ignition technique at 550 degrees C. Results: The textural analysis of sediments allowed to recognize a wide predominance of silty clay in the most of the lake bottom, in addition to two smaller groups: clayey silt, along the front of the mouth of the lake's main tributary, and clays, in the areas of lower hydrodynamic. Furthermore, the proportion of organic matter in the sedimenst ranged between 7 and 12%. The data obtained did not show significant differences between the seasons of the year analyzed. Conclusions: The predominance of fine sediments with content of organic matter, probably have a major role in the trophic structure of the lake being the detritus an important path to the energy flow in the ecosystem.																			0188-8897					MAY-AUG	2021	31	2					179	191																WOS:000819484600007

P limitation was observed at sites across a transect of stream orders throughout the basin; however, at the two sites with highest ambient nitrogen concentrations, limitation was often coupled with nitrogen limitation. Nutrients were at nonlimiting levels at both of two sites below wastewater treatment plants in all seasonal deployments. A Michaelis-Menten growth equation described LETSI as a function of ambient PO4-P concentrations (p < 0.05); the midpoint (LETSI of 0.50) corresponded with a PO4-P concentration of approximately 3 mu g/l. Change-point analysis indicated a threshold point at LETSI of 0.80 and 15 mu g/l PO4-P. These low values show that the periphytic community has a high affinity for available P, and that the watershed as a whole is sensitive to available nutrient inputs.

Overall, 5.6% of original nests were reused at least once. We tested whether nest reuse is adaptive, but found no differences in breeding success between those pairs that reused nests and those that did not. We also tested whether nest reuse should be more frequent when scrapes are difficult to excavate than when it is easier to excavate them, and found that nests on hard substrates were more frequently reused than nests on soft substrates, and that nest reuse was more frequent in the second half of the season, when the nesting substrate is harder, than in the first half of the season.

J	GASSE, F				GASSE, F			DIATOMS FOR RECONSTRUCTING PALEOENVIRONMENTS AND PALEOHYDROLOGY IN TROPICAL SEMIARID ZONES - EXAMPLE OF SOME LAKES FROM NIGER SINCE 12000 BP	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Palaeoenvironments are reconstructed from the diatom flora of Holocene swamp and lacustrine sediments which lie in closed depressions of the Chad basin (Niger). The geological and hydrological setting of the sedimentary profiles investigated is presented in section I. Three types of hydrological environments are considered: depressions which have been connected with L. Chad during the Holocene, small river-fed basins outside of the maximum extension of L. Chad, and depressions which have been mainly supplied by groundwater. Methods used for palaeoecological reconstruction are discussed (section II) on the basis of the present-day distribution of diatom species and communities in the investigated zones. Attention is drawn to the diversity of the habitats in a given waterbody, and on the potential effects of seasonality and water stratification on the composition of diatom assemblages contained in the sediments. Because of the spatial and temporal changes in diatom communities, the sediment may integrate a mixture of communities with different ecological requirements. Thus, mean values of indivdual ecological variables deduced from a fossil assemblage are not sufficient to characterize a palaeoenvironment. In section III, a classification of the palaeoenvironments is proposed. One attempts to distinguish the different communities contained in the fossil assemblages. The fossil communities are compared to diatom populations living today in the studied zones, or in other African sectors when no regional analogue has been found, and for which ecological conditions are known. This allows environmental characteristics to be inferred from sedimentary profiles. At a given time, the palaeosystems show the same ecological diveristy as the modern ones. The main status of the palaeoenvironmental evolution are then drawn for each stratigraphical profile (sective IV), for an understanding of their causes. The major climatic tendencies affecting intertropical Africa have been chiefly responsible for the presence or absence of aquatic environments in the closed depressions. Superimposed to that, the diversity and the evolution of the individual palaeoecosystems have been controlled by local topographical and hydrological factors (origin of water, permeability of lake floor..). This is a common situation for waterbodies lying in tropical arid and semi-arid zones, and especially for palaeolakes associated to groundwater circulations. Therefore, palaeolimnological data can hardly serve as direct and accurate climatic indicators, if they are not corrected for the effects of local hydrology.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV 16	1987	154						127	163		10.1007/BF00026837	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00026837													WOS:A1987K536700012

However, many of the flagellate species undertake regular, diurnal vertical migration to or through the thermocline. Possible advantages gained by vertical migrations include reduction in losses from hydraulic washout, reduction in grazing losses and overcoming nutrient limitation by obtaining access to deeper reserves of nutrients. The likely relative importance of these possible advantages is examined using published data, mainly from one forest lake, Nimeton. It is concluded that vertical migrations may confer several advantages on phytoplankton cells. The single most important advantage will vary seasonally with changes in the relative magnitude of population loss processes.

J	WILLEN, E				WILLEN, E			PLANKTONIC DIATOMS - AN ECOLOGICAL REVIEW	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The increased frequency of planktonic diatoms in lakes maintaining a certain amount of turbulence is conspicuous when bluegreen algae decline as a result of reversed eutrophication. The rising amount of species being large and heavily silicified is also verified. An opposite trend in many coastal areas with an ongoing eutrophication is to be expected, although evidence based on evaluations of long-term marine phytoplankton investigations still is missing, maybe due to lack of relevant data. Planktonic diatoms have, during recent years, been the object of many experiments clarifying their competitive ability, especially concerning growth limiting nutrients. Their very large importance in the water ecosystems of the world is indisputable and a compilation of their ecological prerequisites, facing recent research, is presented here. A general distribution of planktonic diatoms is discussed also against the background of concentrations of silicon in different regions of the world. Differences in silicification of species in the sea and in freshwaters are mentioned and models to calculate the silica content per cell are reviewed. A discussion is hold on the way of planktonic diatoms to survive adverse conditions which seems to be one explanation of their mode of rapid mass-development. The main growth regulating factors of these organisms are turbulence, light climate, temperature, nutrients (silicon, phosphorus, nitrogen) and biotic interactions. As a group they are known to be especially good competitors during turbulence or the onset of stratification in low light, low temperature and a not too nutrient-deficient environment. There is, however, a very large and species-specific variation which also is elucidated. The lack of planktonic diatoms in very acidified lakes is especially commented on. Biotic interactions as grazing and infections of fungal parasites may, intermittently, cause a quick decline of a whole population. Aspects are, further, given on their different mode of development in oligotrophic versus eutrophic ecosystems and their way of quickly taking advantage of a situation with an enlarged mixing zone in the water column. The importance of the mutual relation of growth limiting nutrients as silicon and phosphorus is stated not only to explain shifts in the planktonic diatom community over a range of trophic conditions, but also as a general prerequisite for diatom dominance over that of bluegreen algae, green algae and different kinds of flagellates.																			0003-9136						1991				89			69	106																WOS:A1991GN15500007
J	Gutsalo, LK				Gutsalo, L. K.			Isotope fractionation in the systems CH4-H2O and CH4-CO2 during microbial methane genesis in the Earth's crust	RUSSIAN GEOLOGY AND GEOPHYSICS												Distribution of hydrogen and carbon isotopes (D/H and C-13/C-12) in the microbial systems CH4-H2O and CH4-CO2 was studied in different world's regions. According to the distribution of these isotopes in the above systems, two types of microbial methane are recognized in the Earth's crust: (1) resulting from CO2 reduction and (2) produced through acetate fermentation. In the case of methane 1, the biologic distribution of hydrogen and carbon isotopes in the above systems corresponds to the thermodynamic isotope exchange equilibrium at a given temperature of the methane genesis medium. In the case of methane 2, the same systems show mainly a nonequilibrium distribution of these isotopes. We have revealed a linear relationship between the isotopic compositions of CH4, H2O, and CO2: delta D(CH4) = alpha D-b(D)delta D(H2O) + b and delta C-13(CH4) = alpha C-b(C)delta C-13(CO2) + d, where alpha(b)(D) and alpha(b)(C) are the general factors of biologic nonequilibrium fractionation of hydrogen and carbon isotopes, respectively, in the systems CH4-H2O and CH4-CO2. These factors are determined from the equations 10(3) ln alpha(b)(D) = -477.357(10(6)/T-2) + 3458.55 and 10(3) ln alpha(b)(C) =-277.954(10(6)/T-2) + 1988.677, where T(K) is the temperature of the acetate methanogenic medium. The values of alpha(b)(D) and alpha(b)(C) do not depend (in contrast to the values of b and d) on the kind of bacteria and the temperature of the methane genesis medium. Based on thermodynamic data, we proposed a model for the formation of the isotopic composition of microbial methane in nature. Variations in the hydrogen and carbon isotope compositions of microbial methane in various geologic objects are due mainly to the variations in the temperature of the methanogenic medium and the mixing (in different proportions) of methane 1 with methane 2. The portions of acetate fermentation methane in the total balance of microbial methane in different geologic objects vary over a wide range of values: 52 to 100% in marine deposits of Cape Lookout Bight, North Carolina, US; 65 to 100% in surface fresh waters of Lake Wuermsee, Germany; and 35% in Lake Kivu, East Central Africa.

J	LINN, IJ; CAMPBELL, KLI				LINN, IJ; CAMPBELL, KLI			INTERACTIONS BETWEEN WHITE-BREASTED CORMORANTS PHALACROCORAX-CARBO (AVES, PHALACROCORACIDAE) AND THE FISHERIES OF LAKE MALAWI	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. The status of white-breasted cormorants Phalacrocorax carbo lucidus as possible competitors with the fisheries of Lake Malawi was assessed. 2. Numbers of P. carbo on the lake were estimated, from visual counts and photographs of resting sites taken at last light, to be 10 000 individuals in 1979. 3. Observations were concentrated on a colony of 5000+ birds on Boadzulu Island, in the south-east arm of the lake, the main area of commercial fishing. The birds fished in a single large flock, in shallow water, at or near the sandy or muddy bottom. 4. The birds' diet was assessed qualitatively and quantitatively from examination of regurgitates and cast pellets recovered at the nests, of fish dropped by the birds during their feeding activities, of the stomach contents of shot birds, and from the amounts consumed by captive cormorants. The mean daily weight of fresh fish caught by an adult, non-breeding cormorant was 250 g, rising to 293 g during the breeding season. 5. Annual fish consumption of the Boadzulu Island colony, including nestlings, was 491 t, of which 392.5 t came from the south-east arm of Lake Malawi. The entire white-breasted cormorant population of Lakes Malawi and Malombe consumed 950 t year-1. 6. The standing stock of available prey in the areas fished by the Boadzulu birds was 126.3 kg ha-1. This stock should be able to withstand indefinitely the cormorant exploitation of 21.6 kg ha-1 year-1. 7. Available prey in the areas fished by the cormorants was estimated from sample trawls. The birds took fish in rough proportion to their abundance. 8. The average catch by man over the years 1979-87, in the south-east arm of Lake Malawi, of the fish groups which formed the main prey of the cormorants, was 10417 t. The harvest by the birds in the same area in 1979 represents 3.8% of this figure, or 14.9% of the 2634 t of small demersal cichlids, the cormorants' preferred prey, in the catch. 9. But the cormorants forage in areas which are not exploited by either commercial or traditional fishing, and most of the demersal fish which are the cormorants' main prey have very restricted distributions within the lake, so that only a few species with wide distributions are common in both commercial fishing and cormorant feeding areas. The cormorants' harvest of fish species common in commercial trawling is 70 t year-1. This is only 2.7% of the human harvest of demersal cichlids. 10. It is concluded that the white-breasted cormorant has no significant impact on the commercial or traditional fisheries at resent carried out on Lake Malawi.																			0021-8901						1992	29	3					619	634		10.2307/2404470	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2404470													WOS:A1992KB87800009

An increase in electrical conductivity and a reduction in transparency was also observed. After fertilization, the nutrients declined rapidly, remaining low until the next floods. Principal component analysis revealed three distinct periods relative to the concentration of nutrients, i.e. a fertilization period, an assimilation period, and a period of stocking in biomass, These results are discussed in relation to other oxbow lakes, in an attempt to identify ecological factors responsible for the fertilization of these ecosystems.

These two models differ only in the energy that fish allocate to standard metabolism and activity. Daily ration and body mass of age 3(+) dace from Lake Triton were estimated on 29 occasions during a 67-d period (lune 22 - August 27, 1992). Water temperature and caloric density of fish and food were also monitored. Fish growth was on average 2.5 cal . d(-1) (1 cal = 4.19J). Observed cumulative consumption for an average fish was 7.6 kcal. Seasonal consumption predicted by the first and second models was 33.5 and 6.5 kcal, respectively. The prediction of the second model was not significantly different from our direct estimate. The second bioenergetic model can be used to accurately predict the feeding rate of dace in the field by using models of maximum standard respiration (MSR) currently available in the literature (intercept = 0.015, slope = -0.2) with an activity multiplier of 1. Alternatively, because these models often include energy expenditures associated with digestion and/or activity, a MSR model having an intercept of 0.006 with an activity multiplier of 3 can also be used.

Landsat imagery, and field observations to measure the area of seasonally flooded land and of permanent waterbodies on the fringing floodplain of the Orinoco River. The fringing floodplain covers 7,000 km of which 2,294 permanent lakes cover 7%. Most (85%) of the seasonally inundated land is forested. Geomorphologic features such as elevation, lateral extent, and the locations of tributary inflows and control points (resistant outcrops of rock along the river banks) are important to the hydrology and ecology of the floodplain because they control the flow paths and water depths during inundation, which in turn affect nutrient supply, deoxygenation, washout of planktonic organisms, sedimentation, and mixing of floodplain waters into the river. Asymetric loading of sediment by tributaries may explain the larger area of floodplain along the left bank. The fringing floodplain has been formed largely by overbank deposition of sediment, and unlike the floodplains of the Parana and Peruvian Amazon, it has changed relatively little during recent floods of extraordinary magnitude.

Cercopagis pengoi (Cladocera: Cercopagidae) is from the Ponto-Caspian region of Eurasia, as is a previous cercopagid invader, Bythotrephes longimanus. Cercopagis tolerates a wide range of salinities and temperatures, has many life history traits characteristic of a successful invader, and has previously invaded the Baltic Sea Cercopagis may affect native zooplankton populations and fish populations through both predation and competition, although the extent of these interactions is not yet known. More research regarding basic life history traits and ecology of Cercopagis is needed to assess the role it will play in Lake Erie.

The hydrological cycle of the lake is manipulated for rice cultivation in the area. Seasonality and the particular hydrological cycle of the lake were the principal factors influencing long-term phytoplankton dynamics. Annual or horizontal differences were less important than the seasonal factor. However, a trend of phosphate increase and underwater illumination decrease was observed between 1980 and 1988. These changes might be related to some species year-to-year variations, although in general interannual phytoplankton changes were scarce. Spatial phytoplankton differences were much smaller than physical and chemical differences, which were mainly related to loading and residence times at the different sampling zones. Shallowness, hypertrophy and the regular hydrological cycle of the Albufera for rice yield, seem to contribute to the maintenance of an almost stable and homogeneous algal community, mainly composed of filamentous cyanophytes. RDA analysis has proved to be an efficient method in yielding valuable information on phytoplankton-environment interactions and trends over a long series of data. It seems also a feasible technique to monitor the results of lake management and restoration in the future.																			0018-8158					MAR 10	1995	299	2					93	101		10.1007/BF00017561	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00017561													WOS:A1995QU04600001

However, its biomass is affected for level decreasing of Lake Titicaca. Therefore, the aims were to determine the fresh Llaska biomass in the rainy and dry season on three communities around the lake and to assess the level success of Llaska colonies transplanted to increase the available biomass. The biomass assessment was using a 0.25 cm side metal quadrant. For transplanting Llaska colonies susceptible to die were used, which were distributed in rows at 10 m from the lake shore. The highest biomass was found in the rainy season, particularly in March (78528 +/- 89.98 g/m(2)). The biomass was similar between the three study areas, although it was high in Llachon community. Transplant of Llaska colonies was successful, since both the colonies height and diameter increased during the assessment time. In particular, Llaska height had the greatest response during the evaluation time. Therefore, with the transplantation of dying colonies we could increase the biomass available to food purposes.

Native to the Amazon region, it occurs naturally on the seasonally-flooded banks of lakes and rivers, but also has been cultivated commercially in terra firme. In this study, phenological observations and fruit yield evaluations were carried out in a natural population of camu-camu in a floodplain habitat and a plantation in terra firme in central Amazonia. Biweekly visits were made over one year to collect data on flowering, fruiting and leaf phenology. At the height of flowering, flower buds were marked and tracked until fruit matured and were harvested for biometrics and seed counting. Fruits varied from 1.01 to 2.73 cm in diameter and 1.14 to 10.87 g in weight and fruit production was higher in the wild stand. Phenology differed between habitats and phenophase synchrony was higher in the natural population. Despite being native to flooplain forests, fruit production in terra firme occurred throughout the year, suggesting that there are few restrictions on fruit development in cultivated plantation.

Food habits of cutthroat trout changed with body size, season, and time of day. Cutthroat trout ate invertebrates (Daphnia pulicaria, Neomysis mercedis, and various insects) until they reached a large enough size (generally when fork length is longer than 250 mm) to capture small fishes. Seasonal changes in the distribution of cutthroat trout corresponded with that of their primary prey, the longfin smelt, Spirinchus thaleichthys, when it was available. Juvenile sockeye salmon was a relatively minor constituent of the diet. Cutthroat trout appear to feed primarily in the littoral and upper limnetic zones, and respond to the diel and seasonal differences in accessibility of prey in these zones. This suggests that predation on juvenile sockeye salmon by cutthroat trout might increase in response to enhancement measures or to declines in the longfin smelt population.																			0029-344X					AUG	1992	66	3					149	159																WOS:A1992JF87000001

The experiment, operated in an unattended, remote fashion, has resulted in a substantial data set from which mean neutral winds have been determined. Dependent upon geomagnetic activity, the nocturnal location of the site is either equatorward of the auroral oval or within the oval boundaries. The data set is rich enough to permit hourly binning of neutral winds based upon the K-p geomagnetic disturbance index as well as the season. For cases of low geomagnetic activity the averaged, vector horizontal neutral wind exhibits the characteristics of a midlatitude site displaying antisunward pressure-gradient-driven winds. As the geomagnetic activity rises the late afternoon and evening winds slowly rotate sunward in an anticlockwise direction, initially remaining near 100 m/s in speed but eventually increasing to 300 K-p > 5. For the higher levels of activity the observed neutral wind flow pattern resembles a higher-latitude polar cap pattern characterized by ion drag forcing of thermospheric neutral gases. In addition, rotational Coriolis forcing on the dusk side enhances the ion drag forcing, resulting in dusk winds which trace out the clockwise dusk cell plasma flow. On the dawn side the neutral winds also rotate in an anticlockwise direction as the strength of geomagnetic disturbances increase. Since the site is located at a transition latitude between the midlatitude and the polar cap, the data set provides a sensitive test for general circulation models which attempt to parameterize the contribution of magnetospheric processes. A comparison with the vector spherical harmonic (VSH) model indicates several regions of poor correspondence for December solstice conditions but reasonable agreement for the vernal equinox.

J	KERFOOT, WC				KERFOOT, WC			BOSMINA REMAINS IN LAKE WASHINGTON SEDIMENTS - QUALITATIVE HETEROGENEITY OF BAY ENVIRONMENTS AND QUANTITATIVE CORRESPONDENCE TO PRODUCTION	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Bay environments differ in productivity and species composition from open waters. Transects of surface sediments in Lake Washington (Seattle) reveal significant morphological gradients in the small pelagic cladoceran Bosmina longirostris. In all bays examined, these bosminids range from shorter featured clones nearshore to longer featured clones offshore. However, because bays constitute such a limited areal extent of the lake (4.9%), only 2.3% of remains in midlake sediments came from bay populations. A core taken from midlake waters indicates nearly uniform long-featured morphology of offshore Bosmina over the past 80-125 yr. The localized deposition of remains in bays underscores that biodiversity surveys of large lakes need to include bays in addition to open-water samples. Clarifying how abundant cladoceran remains are produced, transported to, and preserved in sediments is crucial for interpreting historical sequences. A simple vertical model, derived from molting and death schedules, accurately predicts relative seasonal fluxes for remains at a midlake site (r = 0.94-0.95). However, the absolute flux is low, <7% of the expected rate, suggesting substantial loss through decomposition and fragmentation. Use of abundant cladoceran microfossils to reconstruct species-specific or general secondary production requires careful calibration studies, although the potential dividends are great.																			0024-3590					MAR	1995	40	2					211	225		10.4319/lo.1995.40.2.0211	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1995.40.2.0211													WOS:A1995QZ60800001

The overall prevalence of the parasite was high, 41.5% (n = 1,476), while the mean abundance was relatively low, 1.24 +/- 2.11. The parasite exhibited evident seasonality in changes of prevalence and abundance. In brief, prevalence and abundance were very low in midwinter (January), but increased and remained relatively high in other seasons and months. The distribution pattern of this parasite in the fish was overdispersed, with a variance to mean ratio > 1, but its frequency distribution could not be described by the negative binomial model. There were positive correlations between the number of the parasites per fish and the age and length of the fish; a peaked age-parasite abundance curve was not detected in the parasite-host association. It is suggested that the parasite P. pawlovskii has little effect on the population structure of the bullhead catfish.						nie, pin/0000-0002-9492-2940													0022-3395	1937-2345				AUG	2005	91	4					850	853		10.1645/GE-422R.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1645/GE-422R.1								17089753					WOS:000231814200018

The atmospheric concentrations of chlorinated hydrocarbons decreased in the transport process from northern lands to Antarctica, but the compositions of PCB, DDT compounds and HCH isomers were relatively uniform throughout this process. Regional and seasonal variations were found in aerial concentrations of these pollutants at Syowa Station and adjacent seas in Antarctica. Chlorinated hydrocarbons were also detected in snow, ice, lake water and sea water samples, in which high concentrations were found in snow and ice samples. Snow and ice served as media of supply of these pollutants into the Antarctic marine environment. The concentrations of DDT and higher chlorinated biphenyls were lower in sea water under fast ice than in that from the outer margin of pack ice. The active removal of these pollutants occurred in the sea under fast ice, and was strongly associated with high primary productivity. The concentrations of PCB and DDT in marine organisms living under fast ice in Antarctica probably was lower than those in other oceans.

Zooplankton and profundal macroinvertebrate responses to hypolimnetic oxygenation in North Twin Lake, Washington	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Cross BK, Taylor TN, Moore BC, Lanouette BP. 2021. Zooplankton and profundal macroinvertebrate responses to hypolimnetic oxygenation in North Twin Lake, Washington. Lake Reserv Manage. XX:XXX-XXX. Hypolimnetic oxygenation (HO) has been used to address lake eutrophication and fish habitat limitations, but details on zooplankton and profundal macroinvertebrate community responses are required to fully understand the trophic linkages and impacts. Compared to adjacent South Twin Lake (an unoxygenated reference), zooplankton and profundal macroinvertebrate densities and distributions were altered by HO in North Twin Lake. Overall, temporal trends in zooplankton density were similar between lakes despite oxygenation, suggesting annual and seasonal influences remained a primary factor affecting their density trends. During the day, Chaoborus density was significantly greater in the water column of unoxygenated South Twin Lake compared to oxygenated North Twin Lake (P < 0.0001) as the oxygenated hypolimnion no longer provided refuge from fish predation. Daphnia and copepod densities were greater in North Twin Lake during oxygenation compared to South Twin Lake (P = 0.0011 and P = 0.0005), which may reflect increases in zooplankton habitat availability and reduced predation from Chaoborus in response to HO. With higher levels of dissolved oxygen near the sediment-water interface in North Twin Lake, larval Chaoborus and chironomid densities in the benthic sediments were significantly higher compared to South Twin Lake (P < 0.0001 in both cases). Vertical distribution of zooplankton likely reflected some balance between habitat availability, energetic costs, and predation risk.

J	VEGASVILARRUBIA, T; HERRERA, R				VEGASVILARRUBIA, T; HERRERA, R			EFFECTS OF PERIODIC FLOODING ON THE WATER CHEMISTRY AND PRIMARY PRODUCTION OF THE MAPIRE SYSTEMS (VENEZUELA)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The Mapire river mouth forms a complex floodplain system, where the river behaves as a river during the dry season, but changes to a transient lake which partially covers the inundation forest during the rainy season. Thus, we expected changes in water chemistry and a gradual increase of primary production during high waters. The system was sampled monthly for one year; two floodplain lakes were also studied for comparative purposes. Variations in the concentration of macro- and micronutrients occurred in a pulse-like manner and seemed to relate to mechanisms at work in the transient lake. Dissolved oxygen showed a stratification with low values at the bottom, but never reached anoxia. Net and gross primary production and respiration did not show any clear spatial pattern, reflecting a mosaic of different biochemical states within the transient lake. Heterotrophy tended to prevail in the transient lake, while autotrophy dominated floodplain lakes.

J	Park, H; Chung, S; Kim, S				Park, Hyungseok; Chung, Sewoong; Kim, Sungjin			Effect of buoyant turbulence and water quality factors on the CO2 net atmospheric flux changes in a stratified reservoir	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The temporal variations in CO2 net atmospheric flux (NAF) in stratified reservoirs are controlled by both physical and biological factors. However, research on the factors and processes affecting CO2 NAF variability over time is insufficient, and as a result, there is considerable uncertainty in present estimations of global reservoir CO2 emissions. In the present study, we analyzed the effects of hydrodynamic and water quality factors on CO2 NAF variability in a stratified reservoir based on field studies and data modeling. Three empirical and four surface renewal gas transfer models were used to characterize the effects of hydrodynamic factors on gas transfer rate and CO2 NAF at the air-water interface. Buoyant turbulence notably affected CO2 NAF when the stratification strength was reduced. As a result, the CO2 NAF (1485 mg-CO2 m(-2) day(-1)) estimated using surface renewal models that considered the effects of buoyant turbulencewere twice greater than the NAFs estimated using empirical models that only considered wind force (724 mg-CO2 m(-2) day(-1)). The best linear regression model explained 81.6% of the temporal variation in CO2 NAF using water temperature (Tw), electrical conductivity (EC), pH, chlorophyll a, total organic C (TOC), and alkalinity. The nonlinear parsimonious random forest model explained 84.4% of the temporal change in CO2 NAF using only three independent variables (EC, dissolved oxygen, and TOC). Principal component analysis revealed that the CO2 NAF tended to be large under low Tw, weak stratification, and lowpH. These results indicate that the temporal variability of CO2 NAF in the stratified reservoir can be predicted using data-driven modeling with minimal water quality variables and selection of an appropriate gas exchange model. The findings improve the accuracy of estimates of CO2 emissions and monitoring activities in stratified reservoirs. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Wang, YS; Tong, ZH; Fan, YY				Wang, Yan-Shan; Tong, Zhong-Hua; Fan, Yang-Yang			Spatial and temperal patterns in bacterioplankton communities across a river-lake continuum	LIMNOLOGICA												Bacterioplankton play critical roles in biogeochemical cycling. Although spatial and temporal variations in bacterioplankton community compositions (BCCs) within individual habitat have been reported, knowledge gaps remain for studies conducted within different habitats. In this work, we examined the seasonal and spatial variability of BCCs in Nanfei River and Lake Chaohu which had significant environmental heterogeneity using a high-throughput sequencing technique of 16S rRNA gene amplicons. The results showed that spatial variation has a more obvious impact on the BCCs than seasonal changes. The microbial diversity gradually decreased and BCCs changed obviously along water flow direction from Nanfei River to the western and estern parts of Lake Chaohu over all seasons. LEfSe analysis showed that Nanfei River had higer abundance of species belonging to the orders Rhodocyclales, Methylococcales, Campylobacterales and Flavobacteriales, samples from eastern part of Lake Chaohu were abundant in taxonomies including the order Rickettsiales, while the western part had high abundance of taxonomies belonging to the order Chroococcales. The redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that BCCs in Nanfei River were associated with high nutrient (TP, PO4-P, TN, NH3-N, NO2-N and NO3-N) concentrations and electrical conductivity. Variance partitioning RDA analysis indicated that the combined effects of all variables may be most important affecting BCCs. This study may provide a framework for modeling the change in bacterioplankton communities through different habitats from a river to lake.

J	de Lozada, DS; Baveye, P; Riha, S				de Lozada, DS; Baveye, P; Riha, S			Heat and moisture dynamics in raised field systems of the lake Titicaca region (Bolivia)	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Pre-Kispanic cultures constructed more than 82 000 ha of raised fields for agricultural production in the Lake Titicaca Region, in the current day Bolivia and Peru. Raised fields consist of platforms (up to 1.2 m high and 2-20 m wide), elevated relative to the original soil surface and surrounded by canals (1.6-4.5 m wide). In the last decade, archaeologists have promoted the adoption of raised fields among local farmers as a way to reduce potato (Solanum tuberosum) crop damage caused by mid-growing season frosts in the Altiplano (3800-4000 m above sea level). The objective of the present research was to obtain experimental information on a number of processes that might contribute to the frost mitigation effect. Field experiments were conducted at two sites in the Bolivian Altiplano. Temperature and moisture measurements were made in plots where potato crops were grown. Minimum temperatures during clear nights with fairly calm wind conditions were about 1 degrees C higher at 50 cm above the soil surface in the middle of raised field platforms compared to adjacent flat fields, confirming earlier reports. Differences in minimum temperatures tended to increase with wider canals, whereas a change of platform width from 4 to 6 m had no appreciable effect. Temperature and moisture distributions in platform/canal cross sections suggest that the frost mitigation effect is due mostly to above-ground processes. Specifically, air circulation from canal to platforms, arising from natural convection, and cold air drainage back to the canals satisfactorily account for observed temperature differences. These results should prove useful in the design of raised fields and of physical process-based models to simulate the frost mitigation effect. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Frontal ice-cliff collapse results in temporary river damming, producing initial decreases in discharge and subsequent sudden hood peaks on dam failure. Fluctuations are less than two hours in duration, with a maximum discharge fluctuation magnitude of 50 m(3) s(-1), double that of normal ablation-controlled diurnal fluctuations. As such, these events are exceeded in magnitude only by periodic jokulhlaups resulting from the drainage of an ice-damned lake further up-glacier. The concentration of discharge fluctuations at the beginning of the melt season, the large number of ice blocks within the flow and the confinement of flows between ice block levees all add to the effectiveness of these events in terms of channel erosion and sediment transport.					van de wal, roderik/D-1705-2011														0885-6087					FEB-MAR	1995	9	2					213	226		10.1002/hyp.3360090207	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.3360090207													WOS:A1995QR84900006
J	Hartman, KJ				Hartman, KJ			Diets of white bass in the Ohio waters of Lake Erie during June-October 1988	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Although white bass Morone chrysops support a valuable commercial fishery in Lake Erie, little is documented about their diets, growth, abundance, or other population characteristics. This study sought to describe the growth and feeding habits of 1-year-old and older white bass in the Ohio waters of Lake Erie. Between 13 June and 31 October 1988, I sampled 246 white bass ranging from 158 to 332 mm in total length. White bass were primarily piscivorous, feeding on shiners (Notropis spp.), white perch M. americana, yellow perch Perca flavescens, and chironomids in June but shifting to primarily gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum during July-October (56-97%). Prey sizes of white bass reflected the change from a large number, but low biomass, of invertebrates in June and July (mean size, 3.15 and 6.45 mm, respectively) to mostly age-0 prey fish in August through October (mean prey size, 50.97-85.27 mm). During this time, growth of white bass was nearly linear. Walleye Stizostedion vitreum is the dominant piscivore in Lake Erie. Due to the importance of gizzard shad in the walleye diet, this species has been suggested as the cornerstone of walleye production in Lake Erie. The high use of gizzard shad by white bass throughout most of the growing season lends further support to the belief that gizzard shad were the cornerstone of piscivore production in western Lake Erie during the late 1980s.																			0002-8487					MAR	1998	127	2					323	328		10.1577/1548-8659(1998)127<0323:DOWBIT>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1998)127<0323:DOWBIT>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000076792000015

J	Yokom, S; Axler, R; McDonald, M; Wilcox, D				Yokom, S; Axler, R; McDonald, M; Wilcox, D			Recovery of a mine pit lake from aquacultural phosphorus enrichment: Model predictions and mechanisms	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												A mine pit lake in northern Minnesota, USA, has received substantial nutrient loading from almost five years of intensive salmonid net-pen aquaculture. The lake, Twin City South (TCS), is typical of the approximately 200 mine pit lakes in the region that have formed from runoff, precipitation and groundwater intrusion into exhausted open-pit iron-on mines. Most of the lakes are deep (similar to 20 to >200 m), with small surface area to volume ratios and have small watersheds with no surface outflow. Basin walls are steep and comprised of unconsolidated glacial sediments that are sparsely vegetated and highly erodible. The lakes are typically oligotrophic from phosphorus limitation but have a relatively high dissolved inorganic nitrogen content (similar to 100-1000 mu g N/l). Regulatory concerns that included drinking water degradation and long term eutrophication resulted in a stipulation agreement between the aquaculture company and the state. A part of this agreement required the company to terminate aquaculture and demonstrate the ability of TCS to recover from the effects of aquaculture to four target restoration goals within 2.5 years. With the availability of an extensive data base from several years of field work during aquaculture, this provided an opportunity to utilize two commercially available water quality models for predicting changes in surface and whole-lake phosphorus during a restoration in which the entire phosphorus waste load was essentially eliminated. BATHTUB, an empirical eutrophication model. was used to predict the mean growing season surface total phosphorus, a target restoration parameter. PHOSMOD, a mechanistic phosphorus budget model, was used to predict total phosphorus in the water column. Both models encountered application problems in TCS. The most important factors affecting the application of these models involved the waste load characteristics, DO depletion, sediment P release and a high basin sedimentation rate. Future mine pit lake modeling efforts should consider these factors before applying any water quality model for similar purposes.

Analyses were restricted to ages 1-3. Mean annual female MS varied from 1.3 to 2.7 mates, and the MS pattern was indistinguishable from random. However, female MS increased with age and was affected by arrival date, territory size, and beach size. Female RS also increased with age, and number of mates and year effects were the most significant explanatory variables in each age. Older female RS was increased by priority on a territory and presence of a previous mate. Territory size and beach size varied with population density and did not predictably affect RS. The strong year affect on RS was associated with annual variation in sex ratio and predation. Males produce only one successful clutch per year, so MS greater than one is a result of nest loss and does not increase RS. Neither male MS nor RS changed with age. Male reproductive failure rate varied by year. Given that a male produced young, the degree of RS was affected by year, arrival date, priority on a territory, territory size, and beach size. In years with early-season predation, late arrivals had higher RS; territory and beach size effects varied by year. Neither the presence, nor degree, of female care was associated with male RS. Male RS was more subject to annual environmental variability than was female RS, probably because of relatively low annual potential RS among males.																			0340-5443	1432-0762					1991	28	6					433	442		10.1007/BF00164125	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00164125													WOS:A1991FU09900008

All species were attracted to burnt-over areas with 1-10 cm regrowth of grass. Recently burnt areas with no regrowth and areas not burnt during the dry season were avoided. By the end of the dry season the study area was left as a fire mosaic, with different areas burnt at different times during the dry season. Thirty two percent was unburnt. The fires were mainly man-made but for purposes other than wildlife management. Such a fire mosaic has a positive effect on the larger herbivores by supplying protein-rich food during the dry season.

Diving beetles strip eel to the bone	FOOD WEBS												Y Wetting and drying cycles are widely recognised as driving aquatic macroinvertebrate and zooplankton production, providing prey and recruitment opportunities for fish in floodplain river systems. Conversely, invertebrate consumption of fishes features less frequently in food web studies. We used two sources of information: a) the finding of an intact eel skeleton and an exceedingly high number of diving beetles (Cybister sp.) from an overnight fyke net catch, and, b) catch records of large diving beetles according to wetland type in northern Queensland, Australia, to discuss the possible role of diving beetles in tropical wetlands. We contend that wetlands with wetting and drying cycles, and notably those with floating plants such as lilies completely covering the water surface, are likely to provide seasonal arenas for diving beetles to gain advantage over gill breathing vertebrates.

This paper reports the results of investigations carried out to identify the factors controlling the processes of delta erosion and sedimentation and to evaluate the impact of recent changes in the operational directives for power stations. Successive regulation phases have gradually reduced the amplitude of seasonal variations in water stage from the natural range of 8 m and resulted in an extended period of high and more constant water level. Local sediment redistribution within the delta has decreased over the years reducing the downstream extent of the sedimentation zone. As a result, a new phase in the delta development was initiated with marked proximal accumulation. The sub-aerial part of the delta increased rapidly in area as a greater proportion of the suspended load tended to be deposited on the delta plain. The impact of the delta changes on fish communities and fish habitats is discussed.																			0144-7815		1-901502-96-1				2002		276					103	112																WOS:000185215200013

The sediment accumulation rate calculated from lamina counts matches that estimated from a Pb-210 chronology, indicating that the laminations were deposited annually. The oxygen-isotope composition of the surface white layer is equivalent to that of surface water, which shows that white-layer aragonite is formed in isotopic equilibrium with the lake water, and suggests that isotopic analyses of these layers may provide valid paleoclimatic information. Because the aragonite is probably precipitated during dry-season mixing, aragonite delta(18)O values for individual laminae reflect the composition of the entire lake, integrated over its water-residence time of about 10 years. The sedimentary record of oxygen-isotope variations should therefore be interpreted as a proxy-climate record with decadal rather than annual resolution. Comparisons between delta(18)O values for the laminae and climate data for equivalent years show no clear relationships, so calibration of the sedimentary record requires a more detailed understanding of the climatic controls on the isotopic composition of these groundwater-fed lakes. An isotopic mass-balance model of the lake's response to rainfall variation shows (1) that the oxygen isotope composition of the lake waters varies by about 1 parts per thousand, which is comparable to the range of delta(18)O values determined from the individual laminae; and (2) that modelled lake level is a reasonable match to observed levels, confirming that climate changes can interpreted from the oxygen-isotope record.

Gold contents of natural waters from the immediate vicinity of Lac Sheen showed a distinct anomaly ( < 2.5- 1 000 ng/L) relative to regional background ( < 2.5- 1 00 ng/L). Based on sampling in August and November 1989 and June 1990, no significant seasonal or water depth variations were detected, and groundwaters were not distinct from lake waters. Much of the Au appears to be present in true solution. Significant concentrations of Pt ( < 10- 1 50 ng/L) and Pd ( < 2.5-400 ng/L) were also detected, predominantly in dissolved form, in Lac Sheen waters and associated groundwaters. Platinum and Pd, unlike Au, exhibited mild and extreme seasonal variations, respectively. Concentrations in the soil samples were: Au ( < 0. 5-57 ppb); Pd ( < 0. 5-29 ppb); and Pt ( < 2-306 ppb). Anomalous concentrations of Pt, Pd, Cu and Ni in B-horizon soil clearly identify known mineralization. In addition to a weak Au anomaly near known mineralization, several other Au anomalies are irregularly scattered throughout the study area, perhaps reflecting the dispersion of this metal from several sources. Anomalous concentrations of Pd, and to a lesser extent Cu, exhibit a more systematic pattern and are found both down- and up-ice, whereas additional Pt anomalies are found only several hundred meters to the north of the known mineralization.					; Cook, Nigel/A-4892-2009	Cook, Nigel/0000-0002-7470-3935; 													0375-6742					DEC	1992	46	2					187	228		10.1016/0375-6742(92)90079-N	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0375-6742(92)90079-N													WOS:A1992KF05900003

The total number of weevils captured in 160 traps from April 1989 through May 1990 was 833. Weevil emergence was reduced 70% compared with the check in May, June, and September (1989) and March and April 1990. There was no difference between nematode treatments. Efficacy trials conducted in a grove in Fort Pierce, Florida, for control of the citrus root weevil, Pachnaeus opalus and P. litus, gave similar results. A study to determine seasonal variation of a native heterorhabditd population in a grove adjacent to the Lake Jem grove was inconclusive.																			0015-4040	1938-5102				DEC	1992	75	4					563	567		10.2307/3496138	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3496138													WOS:A1992KH68100020

In addition, phosphorus release experiments using intact sediment cores were performed in the laboratory. Ferrous iron was generated to the interstitial water in two layers, namely in the surface sediments and at .apprxeq. 10-30 cm down in the sediment. Manganese in a reduced form was mobilized in a single layer close to the sediment-water interface, while phosphate was generated at a sediment depth of 3-8 cm in shallow areas (2 m) and in deeper sediment layers (> 25 cm) at a water depth of 4 m. A mobilization of both ferrous iron and phosphate in the interstitial water mainly during periods of high water temperature and ETS activity in the surface sediments, suggests that microbial processes were involved in the liberation. Reduction of ferric iron-phosphorus complexes could account for only a minor proportion of the phosphate mobilization in the interstitial water as demonstrated by the P/Fe molar ratios. In accordance, ferric iron formation, caused by ferrous iron diffusion from deeper sediment layers and oxidation at the sediment surface, could only partially retain the diffusive phosphate flux towards the sediment-water interface. The phosphorus retention capacity appears to be low in Lake Vallentunasjon sediments, even at high bottom water oxygen concentrations.

WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Some evidences about the toxicity of heavy metals on phytoplankton communities have been documented; notwithstanding, a little of information about the toxic effects elicited by these toxicants prevails. The study aim was to evaluate the relationships between heavy metals on freshwater phytoplankton communities (FWPC) with biomarkers of the oxidative stress response. Biomarkers of oxidative damage (TBARS, RC=O), antioxidant defenses (SOD, CAT, and GPx), and burdens of Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb, and Zn were measured on FWPC from four artificial lakes and in one natural lake. Relationships with metals and with pH and redox, using principal component analysis (PCA) and redundancy analysis (RDA), were assessed. RDA showed that TBARS and CAT were related to the burden of Fe and with the water levels of Cu in artificial lakes at the beginning of the rainy season. SOD and GPx activities were influenced by loads of Cu, Pb, Mn, and Zn and by the pH and redox from artificial lakes between the months of February and April. By PCA, it was found that oxidation of proteins was similar in the FWPC from ancient lake and semiartificial lake; however, it was not related to the burdens of metals neither to the concentration of heavy metals in the water. On the FWPC from the natural lake, none of the biomarkers under study was related to the burdens or water concentration of heavy metals. Endogenous levels of heavy metals are responsible for the oxidative stress response on the FWPC, particularly, noticeable in the phytoplankton communities from artificial lakes.

Bacterioplankton dynamics and its relations to productivity in carp fish ponds	BULGARIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE												This Study investigates dynamics of bacterioplankton in four carp fish ponds in Bulgaria during June-September period in 2005. Plankton gross primary production (GPP), chlorophyll a, phaeopigments, nutrients and environmental physico-chemical variables were registered simultaneously. The aim was to search for differences between treated and non-treated with organic manure ponds by comparing bacterioplankton abundance and in its relationships between the above listed variables on one hand, and numbers, biomass or percentages of bacterial morphological groups on the other by means of statistical analyses. The differences between bacterioplankton numbers of manured and non-manured ponds although insignificant, were close to the significance border. The bacterial biomass of control ponds tended to be higher during the first half of the experiment while during the second the tendency reversed. Oxygen saturation was the major environmental factor with significant influence on both number and biomass of bacteria in seasonal aspect. There were a positive relation (R=0.495, P=0.0046) of oxygen saturation to the number of free-living cocci - the most numerous part of bacterioplankton community, and a negative one (R=-0.5 19, P=0.0023) to on detritus attached bacteria. Free-living rods were weakly influenced by oxygen saturation. GPP was positively related to abundance while hydraulic retention time (RT) to biomass of free-living bacterioplankton. The temporal variations of factors mentioned above (GPP and RT) had opposite effects on development of bacteria attached on detritus. Chlorophyll a and nutrients (phosphorus, nitrogen) did not correlate to the development of bacteria neither in spatial not, in temporal aspect.					; Terziyski, Doychin/KHD-7614-2024; Kalcheva, Hristina/AAF-8888-2019	Nikolova, Lyudmila/0000-0002-6714-5306; Kalcheva, Hristina/0000-0003-0200-9335; Ivanova, Angelina/0000-0002-6394-0863													1310-0351					APR	2008	14	2					186	194																WOS:000258692300013

Vertical and temporal variation of Zn in the soils of a multiple habitat system	JOURNAL OF FOOD AGRICULTURE & ENVIRONMENT												The concentration of Zn in wetland, grassland and woodland in Keoladeo National Park (KNP), Bharatpur, India, was studied on a spatiotemporal scale. The study was carried out for three consecutive years (2003 - 2005). Soil samples up to the depth of 100 cm were collected annually from three habitats (wetland, grassland and woodland). To study seasonal variations, samples were collected bimonthly from wetland habitat only. In total, 630 samples were collected and analyzed. The concentration of Zn ranged from 30.80 to 96.1 mg/kg in the three habitats. The level of Zn was highest in the wetland and lowest in the woodland. In the wetland, the average Zn concentration in each layer followed the order: 0-5 cm > 5-10 cm > 15-20 cm > 10-15 cm. In contrast, the average metal concentration on monthly basis was in the order: September > November > January > May > July > March. The reason for higher levels of the metal in the aquatic habitat than in the terrestrial ones could be because of the higher level of soil organic matter in the wetland. The organic matter content (%) was negatively correlated with the zinc level and needs further investigation. The levels of zinc were high in the upper layers of the soil profile. The level of zinc was significantly different only among the habitats (LSD, P < 0.05).					Azeez, PA/H-6762-2018; Azeez, P/M-2827-2015; Prusty, B./AAC-2916-2020; Prusty, B.

An intensive fish stock reduction program begun in 1984 reduced the catches of pelagic Arctic char by approximately 60% from 1981 to 1986. The crustacean plankton was dominated by Bosmina longispina, Cyclops scutifer, and Eudiaptomus graciloides. With the exception of a density increase of B. longispina, only minor changes were found in the density and species composition of the zooplankton after the stock reduction. Terrestrial insects and crustacean plankton dominated the diet of pelagic Arctic char in both 1981 and 1986. Cyclops scutifer was positively selected in June and July of both seasons. Following the density increase of B. longispina, this species was strongly selected in August-September. Other zooplankton species were either avoided or randomly selected.																			0002-8487					MAY	1994	123	3					385	394		10.1577/1548-8659(1994)123<0385:SPBPAC>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1994)123<0385:SPBPAC>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1994NT40400012

J	STEPHENSON, TD				STEPHENSON, TD			FISH REPRODUCTIVE UTILIZATION OF COASTAL MARSHES OF LAKE-ONTARIO NEAR TORONTO	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Five coastal marshes in the Toronto region of the Lake Ontario shoreline were studied to assess fish utilization for spawning and rearing of young. A combination of gear was used to obtain a broad sample of the fish communities during the latter half of the ice-free season in 1985 and the earlier half in 1986. In total, 36 fish species were collected, with a range of 23 to 27 species from individual marshes. Dramatic changes in fish community composition occurred over the seasons, primarily reflecting patterns of reproductive use. Spawning adults of 23 species and young-of-the-year or yearlings of 31 species were collected within the marshes. A total of 32 species, or 89% of all species encountered, utilize these coastal marshes for some aspect of reproduction. These include several game and commercial fish species and a number of forage species. Although all of these marshes have been altered by human activities in this heavily urbanized region, they are still fulfilling an essential ecological function of providing spawning and nursery habitat and supporting at least local populations of many fish species.																			0380-1330						1990	16	1					71	81		10.1016/S0380-1330(90)71399-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(90)71399-8													WOS:A1990DE25300008

Based on paired time series for zooplankton and phytoplankton in three lakes: Mjosa (12 years), Farris (2 years) and Lake Washington (29 years), we construct phase portraits and quantitatively analyse their trajectories in an attempt to characterize interaction types and strengths. Because we can infer the type of interactions each pair partake in priori (e.g., a phytoplankton/zooplankton pair is a prey/predator pair), we hypothesize that it is possible to distinguish trajectories resulting from a pair that compete from those of a pair constituting a prey/predator pair. We found that competition and predation can be distinguished based on the time series of the interacting species' biomass. Break points in population trajectories (i.e., population collapse) and the counter clockwise rotation of the trajectory in the phase portrait give the strongest signals of predation and the signals correspond to what we expect from classical predation theory. For competition we can only give plausible biological interpretations of identified signals, since signals from grazing, seasonality and competition are confounded.																			0003-9136					JUL	2003	157	4					455	471		10.1127/0003-9136/2003/0157-0455	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/0003-9136/2003/0157-0455													WOS:000184873300002

Silver carp have become established and naturalized in environments outside of its native rivers in Asia where adequate seasonal temperatures (April to July in the northern hemisphere; 18 to 25-degrees-C), increases in water levels (0.5 to 2.0 m in 24 h), and current speeds (50 cm to 1 m/s) occur, Silver carp may establish in areas outside Asia, such as the Danube River (central Europe), and the Mississippi and Missouri River basins (U.S.). The feeding niche of silver carp is not a fixed phytoplanktivorous one, but changes according to stocking density, the presence of other fish, and the species composition, size structure, and densities of the plankton. Silver carp exert significant impact on net plankton, zooplankton. and detritus pools. In lakes and reservoirs, severe pressure on limnetic zooplankton has caused blooms of nannoplankton and put silver carp in direct competition with more valuable native, zooplankton-feeding fish. In aquaculture ponds, the shift in phytoplankton size to nannoplankton has not been found to harm water quality and can actually improve it, but phytoplankton biomass levels may increase after stocking the recommended "biological control" densities of silver carp. Current stocking recommendations for silver carp in aquaculture ponds enhance competitive interactions and niche overlap with other fish in polyculture, changing the natural food and spatial niches of the silver carp. Biological control of excessive algal biomass using silver carp can be achieved by use of unfed fish in floating cages.																			0891-4117						1992	6	3-4					257	273																WOS:A1992JA33400003
J	Townsend, SA				Townsend, SA			The influence of retention time and wind exposure on stratification and mixing in two tropical Australian reservoirs	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The seasonal pattern of stratification and mixing, over an eight year period, was examined for two reservoirs. Darwin River Reservoir (DRR) and Manton River Reservoir (MRR) lie in adjacent catchments, 6 km apart, in the Australian wet/dry tropics. The water bodies differ principally in their retention time and wind exposure. Both reservoirs mix completely during the dry season (Jun-Aug), though the duration of holomixis was longer in DRR due to its greater exposure to wind. Thermal stratification developed in both water bodies early in the dry-wet transition (Aug), reaching maximum stability in October. The stability of stratification then decreased over November and December due to deepening of the epilimnion, erosion of the hypolimnion by the metalimnion and hypolimnetic heat gain. Between December and March, winds associated with major wet season meteorological events, such as monsoonal and cyclonic weather, large tropical storms and a rainfall depression, caused holomixis in DRR, usually lasting a few days. MRR, in contrast, did not mix due to the reservoir's shelter from the prevailing winds and the intrusion of cool inflow which strengthened the stability of stratification. A second stability maximum was reached at the end of the wet season in both reservoirs, when weather conditions had cleared and the surface waters had gained heat. During the transition between the wet and dry seasons (Apr, May), DRR experienced either alternating periods of holomixis and stratification, or a gradual breakdown of stratification, similar to that in MRR. The thermal regime of MRR is classified warm monomictic. In contrast, DRR's pattern of circulation is best described as discontinuous warm polymictic, because the reservoir mixed more than once per year, yet experienced long periods of stratification. Although subject to the same regional climate, the thermal regimes of the two reservoirs differed appreciably mainly due to their different retention times and exposure to wind. In addition to regional climatic influences, the interaction between a lake's physical environment and its climate also affect seasonal circulation. This latter influence is probably most pronounced in the tropics where the stability of lake stratification is low relative to higher latitude water bodies.																			0003-9136					FEB	1998	141	3					353	371																WOS:000072798400006

The heat balance over the lake was estimated by using data on the lake surface obtained from the Erhai automatic weather station and solving the surface heat balance equation (HBE) for a mixed layer. Meteorological station data were also used to estimate the long-term heat balance. The surface temperature from in situ observations was compared with that from satellite observations, and the two results were found to be in reasonably good agreement. The satellite data were used to validate the heat balance calculation. The mixed layer depth of Erhai Lake was 6 m in 2008 and 8 m from 2003 to 2008. Lake heat storage showed large annual variation of 50 W m(-2) in amplitude, with a maximum from March to April and a minimum in November. The phases of the latent heat, the sensible heat, and the difference between surface and air temperatures tended to be delayed on the lake as compared with the land. The phase lag in the seasonal variation of evaporation was found to clearly depend on lake depth. The daily change in convection over the lake-land system was greatest in the daytime over the mountainous area and in the nighttime over the lake area. These features arose from differences in the thermal properties of the lake and land surfaces. Non-dimensional evaporation increased with increasing annual mean air temperature, and there was no systematic difference between regions. Nearly 92% of solar radiation was absorbed by the lake within a depth of 2 m. From this finding, the daily range of the lake's surface temperature was quantitatively determined to be about 5 degrees C.

This region is characterized by low seismicity. In the same area, three hydroelectric dams have been operating for the last 30 years. One of them, the Polyphyto dam, is located only 40 km from the epicenter of the 13 May earthquake. In the present work all available seismological aspects of the main event, such as focal properties and source parameters together with foreshock and aftershock characteristics of the earthquake sequence are considered in order to examine whether the water level changes behind the Polyphyto dam induced the unusual seismic activity in this area. Thus, a detailed examination of the seismic activity is made and this is compared to the seismotectonic regime of the region and the reservoir loading from 1976 to 1995. The results show that there is no obvious correlation between seasonal or sharp fluctuations in the water level and the seismicity of the region (except once during 1989). Moreover, comparison with other previous cases of induced seismicity in Greece and in other countries shows no similarities to the Kozani-Grevena earthquake sequence. It is concluded that the Kozani-Grevena earthquake is therefore an event in the framework of the regional seismicity rather than an event triggered by the impounding of the Polyphyto artificial Lake.

During the years 1978 through 1989, the egg-masses deposited by females along isobathic transects at a number of sites in Lochaber Lake were counted. During the years 1984 through 1987, egg-masses were removed from one of the sites in the lake during the spawning seasons. There was a statistically significant reduction in the proportion of egg-masses deposited within the boundaries of the site from which the egg-masses were removed. The analysis strongly suggests that the method of perch spawning behaviour which assumes that any perch selects a spawning site independently of its natal site may be rejected. This result provides additional support for the hypothesis that yellow perch exhibit demic behaviour.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				OCT	1990	47	10					1959	1962		10.1139/f90-220	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f90-220													WOS:A1990EC80300011

In this model, we study the implications that the body sizes of phytoplankton and zooplankton have on the system dynamics. We use ascendency as a goal function or indicator of system performance. Ascendency quantifies growth and development of an ecosystem as a product of total system throughflow and the mutual information inherent in the pattern of internal system flows. Different physiological rate parameters of phytoplankton and zooplankton are assessed by means of allometric relationships applied to their body sizes. We let the phytoplankton body size range from 10mum(3) to 10(7) mum(3) and the zooplankton body size range from 10 mum(3) to 10(4) mum(3) in volume. We also investigate the effects of phosphorus input conditions, corresponding to oligotrophic, mesotrophic and eutrophic systems on system dynamics. Ascendency (to be maximized over phytoplankton and zooplankton sizes) was computed after the system had reached a steady state. Since it always was a seasonal cycle, and the ascendency followed this behavior, we averaged the ascendency over 365 successive days (duration of one year) in the oscillatory phase. Under all types of nutrient conditions, the smallest phytoplankton size yielded the maximal values of the ascendency, while the corresponding zooplankton size varied. Under oligotrophic conditions, a phytoplankton size of 10 mum(3) combined with a zooplankton size of 10(1.25) mum(3) to give the maximum value of the ascendency. Under mesotrophic and eutrophic conditions, maxima were obtained for zooplankton sizes 10(2.26) mum(3) and 10(3.20) mum(3), respectively.

Temporal distribution and population structure of two congeneric species of Cucullanus (Nematoda: Cucullanidae) in Orthopristis ruber in Venezuela	JOURNAL OF HELMINTHOLOGY												The qualitative and quantitative parameters of temporal distribution of Cucullanus tripapillatus and Cucullanus chrysophrydes in the intestine of Orthopristis ruber in the Caribbean Sea on the north of Margarita Island, Venezuela were analysed. A total of 540 fish were collected at random from the catch of commercial trawlers during 1982-83 and 1992-93. Both species of Cucullanus were found throughout the year; prevalence and mean intensity of C. tripapillatus were higher than that of C. chrysophrydes. A significant difference was found in infection between the two years of sampling. Female worms were more abundant than male in both years. Both species exhibited pronounced prevalence and maturity in September and March of each year, indicating seasonality. The patterns of occurrence of the two species of Cucullanus in O. ruber did not change in the 10-year interval but the host size and number of parasites declined, which may be due to over-exploitation of definitive fish hosts.																			0022-149X	1475-2697				MAR	2008	82	1					69	76		10.1017/S0022149X08873567	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022149X08873567								18275633					WOS:000253629600009

Building on our research done in 2004, in this article we report further data gathered during the 2005 climbing season and evaluate the combined results. Methods.-Participants were screened for AMS using the Lake Louise Self-Report Questionnaire and answered questions focusing on AMS symptoms, AMS prevention, and previous history of altitude illness. Carboxyhemoglobin levels were measured by serum co-oximetry. Additional questions assessed stove practices, climbing practices, and climber behaviors. Nonparametric statistical analyses were performed to examine potential relationships between COHb levels, AMS symptoms, and climber behaviors across the 2 years and with years combined. Results.-Overall, 317 climbers participated in the 2-year study. As in 2004, the combined data demonstrated no relationship between positive carbon monoxide (CO) exposure and positive criteria for AMS (P =.276). Climbers in 2005 were 1.92 times more likely to meet positive criteria for AMS, compared to climbers in 2004 (P =.028). On the contrary, climbers in 2004 were 3.93 times more likely to be CO exposed than climbers in 2005 (P = .003). Overall, climbers descending the mountain were more likely to be positive for CO exposure (5.56 times more likely than ascending climbers; P = .002) and to have higher overall mean COHb levels (2.26% descending vs 0.93% ascending, P = .006). The previous association between increased stove use and climbers who met positive criteria for AMS was not observed in the 2005 or in the combined data (P = .715). A relationship was observed between increased hours of operating stoves and increased COHb levels (P = .002). Female climbers were 2.041 times more likely to meet criteria for AMS (P = .043). Conclusions.-No relationship between AMS symptoms and CO exposure was observed. As found in our initial study, descending climbers had higher overall COHb levels and an increased risk of CO exposure (COHb of >3% in nonsmokers and >10% in smokers). Also, increased hours of stove operation was linked to climbers who had elevated COHb levels.

The piezometric head close to the quarry lake proved to be well correlated with seasonal variations in the rainfall. Furthermore, geoelectrical tomography detected no semi-permeable layer between the phreatic aquifer and the lake, so the contact between surface and ground water is good. Finally, a time-varying prescribed head condition can be applied for round water flow modelling.

The macrophyte-dominated lake Biandantang had more protozoan species than the algal lake Houhu, and the two lakes had significantly different protozoan abundance and biomass patterns, compositions and dominants. On annual average, ciliates formed 81.13%, 91.10%, heliozoans 0.20%, 3.49%, and testaceans 18.67%, 5.42% of total protozoan biomass; the protozoans, in turn, formed 49.77%, 49.48% of total zooplankton biomass in lake Biandantang and Lake Houhu, respectively. With respect to ciliates, naked oligotrichs and Peritrichida (mainly 40-80 mum in size) dominated the abundance and Peritrichida dominated the biomass in Lake Biandantang, while Scuticociliatida (mainly smaller than 30 mum ) dominated the abundance and tintinnids dominated the biomass in Lake Houhu.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP	2000	434	1-3					151	163																WOS:000089982800012

Bacterial degradation of MIB was examined in batch culture experiments. Cultures able to metabolize MIB were enriched in a mineral salts medium supplemented with milligram-per-liter levels of the compound and were inoculated with water and sediments samples from reservoirs where MIB is seasonally produced. Bacteria from degrading cultures were isolated on R2A agar and identified as predominantly Pseudomonas spp. Degradation occurred only in cultures consisting of three or more different bacteria. MIB supported growth as the sole added carbon source at 1 to 6.7 mg/liter. MIB was also degraded at microgram-per-liter levels in sterile filtred lake water inoculated with washed bacteria and in synthetic medium supplemented with various sugars or acetate. Complete degradation of MIB took from 5 days to more than 2 weeks. Enrichment with isoborneol, a structural analog of MIB, failed as a preenrichment for MIB degraders. Isoborneol at 20 to 40 mg/liter readily supported bacterial growth, whereas MIB at 12 to 20 mg/liter took months to degrade. The relative recalcitrance of MIB compared with isoborneol may be a result of the additional methyl group in MIB.																			0099-2240	1098-5336				OCT	1988	54	10					2424	2431		10.1128/AEM.54.10.2424-2431.1988	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.54.10.2424-2431.1988								16347753					WOS:A1988Q418300017

Collections of samples were inspected regularly at monthly intervals, always in the middle of the month. The results were compared with the limit values set out by the Government Regulation No. 269/2010 Coll. The average concentration of total phosphorus for individual months during both monitored years was 0.19 mg.dm(-3) with the maximum average concentration in the month of June (0.26 mg.dm(-3)) and the minimum in the months of August and September (0.15 mg.dm(-3)). Its average concentrations at individual sampling sites were relatively balanced and varied from 0.16 (at a side arm of the National Nature Reserve) to 0.23 mg.dm(-3) (at the river mouth of the Cilizian stream into a dead arm). The average concentration of phosphate phosphorus for individual months during both monitored years was 0.08 mg.dm(-3). Depending on the time of sample collection, its average concentrations ranged from 0.05 (November) to 0.12 mg.dm(-3) (August). Depending on the sampling site, the average phosphate phosphorus concentrations varied from 0.07 to 0.10 mg.dm(-3). The data for the year, the month, and the sampling site showed a statistically high significant effect on total phosphorus, and a statistically significant effect for phosphate phosphorus was recorded from data for the month.

Given that Romania's NE (Eastern Carpathians and the northwestern part of the Moldova Plateau) is undergoing increased competition for water resources, triggered by the intensification of agriculture and industrial development, better knowledge of the hydrological processes and the quality of surface water is required. The main purpose of the present study was to identify the hydrological processes determining the quality of surface waters based on analyses of the stable isotopic composition of water from precipitation, rivers and lakes and its quality parameters. For this, water samples were collected from 29 river sections, two lakes and a precipitation monitoring point over a period of 12 months (January to December 2019). The results show that the changes in the isotopic composition of precipitation and surface water are mainly controlled by air temperature, which, in turn, is influenced by the large-scale atmospheric circulation and other factors (e.g. precipitation amount, season, altitude). At the same time, the chemical analyses indicate that the water resources of the study area are predominantly characterized by a good chemical and ecological state, except for two sampling points with a moderate state and three with a poor ecological state.

Samples of S. triostegus were obtained from Ataturk Dam Lake, Turkey, in two month periods during one year as from May. The major components were palmitic acid (16:0), stearic acid (18:0), oleic acid (18:1n-9), palmitoleic acid (16:1n-7), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) and arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4n-6) in total lipid, 16:0, 18:0, 18:1n-9, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n-3), DHA and AA in PL, 16:0, 16:1n7, 18:1n-9, linoleic acid (LA, 18:2n-6), AA, EPA, DHA and docosapentaenoic acid (22:5n-3) in TAG extracted from the liver of S. triostegus in all seasons. N-3/n-6 ratio was found 2.00-2.61 in females, 1.15-2.75 in males in total lipid. The highest lipid content was found in May (2.39%) in the females. In the males, the highest level was found in September (2.91%). In TAG fraction, the component with the lowest ratio in both sexes' TAG is PUFA. In PL fraction, SFA, MUFA, and PUFA percentages were found at similar rates in both sexes in all months.					kaçar, semra/H-3928-2015															2602-473X					2021	36	4					166	174		10.26650/ASE2021863164	http://dx.doi.org/10.26650/ASE2021863164													WOS:000702860200002

Tracing the Remains of a Late Bronze Age Field System in Central Mainland Greece	EUROPE'S EARLY FIELDSCAPES: Archaeologies of Prehistoric Land Allotment	Themes in Contemporary Archaeology-Springer											The assumption that the Late Bronze Age ('Late Helladic' or LH) texts in the Linear B script, used on Crete and mainland Greece and dating to about 1390 to 1190 BC, can be used in conjunction with ethno-archaeological data to model the topography of economic transactions was recently investigated with fieldwork in central Greece. Previously calculated parameters of the dimensions and organisation of land plots recorded in the Linear B archives informed a methodology for discovering a comparable system of fields under suitable conditions in the Aegean. The AROURA project, that formed the basis for this article, identified the Kopaic Basin in northern Boiotia as a suitable study region. Since the end of the last ice age, it has contained a shallow lake with seasonally fluctuating wetland margins, except in the modern era, when it was thoroughly drained, and LH, when it was partially drained, and dykes protected polders of dry land from floods. One of these polders encloses the colossal fortress of Glas, whose storehouses contained thousands of metric tonnes of wheat, indicating extensive cultivation nearby. The polder also displays expansive traces of a premodern landscape beneath the present plough soil. AROURA executed a program of magnetometry, ground-truthed with soil profiling, over 60 ha of land selected from inside the polder around Glas. This fieldwork revealed evidence of canals connected to rivers that were diverted during the LH. The canals appear to feed a network of irrigated fields, particularly to the west of Glas near the polder's dyke. These plots are evidently demarcated by low levees made of lake sediment and parallel ditches. Their size and configuration conform to the topographical model, and radiocarbon and luminescence dates corroborate their already circumstantially probable attribution to the LH. These discoveries raise new questions concerning the process of agricultural intensification and state formation in LH Greece, particularly concerning the origin and history of relevant hydraulic technologies.																			2730-7441		978-3-030-71652-3; 978-3-030-71651-6				2021							143	165		10.1007/978-3-030-71652-3_11	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-71652-3_11	10.1007/978-3-030-71652-3												WOS:001363930400011

The seed point method was used to monitor the water area and volume of Poyang Lake, as an important international wetland and the largest fresh water lake in China, from 2019 to the flood season in 2020 using ZY3, GF-1, GF-3, GF-6, and BJ-2 data. Furthermore, historical water area and water volume changes of Poyang Lake were analyzed utilizing public data set. The results showed that the water area and water volume of Poyang Lake changed significantly in recent sixty years. It also fluctuated violently during the high water and low water seasons from 2019 to 2020. In the past sixty years, the minimum and maximum water area was 1190.73 km(2) in 1960 and 3179.31 km(2) in 2019, respectively, and the water volume increased by 1853.62 million cubic meters. The water area difference of Poyang Lake between the high water season and the low water season was more than quadruple, which varied from 3179.21 km2 in the third quarter in 2019 to 674.01 km2 in the first quarter in 2020, and the water volume decreased by 489.95 million cubic meters.

In this study, six freshwater lakes located in warm temperate, subtropical and tropical zones were selected to investigate the annual dynamics of rotifer communities and their major driving factors. The results indicated that rotifer community structure did not exhibit significant seasonal variations. However, significant differences were observed among climatic zones. The species number and total density of rotifers were significantly higher in subtropical lakes than in lakes from other zones (p < .05). Both multidimensional scaling and detrended correspondence analysis revealed significant separation of tropical samplings from warm temperate and subtropical samplings, which was mainly caused by the higher temperature and lower chlorophyll a content in the tropical lakes. Further analyses indicated that rotifer community structure was mainly affected by water temperature, trophic indices and pH in the warm temperate zone but by chlorophyll a content and Secchi depth in subtropical lakes. In addition, only the Simpson index was significantly associated with Secchi depth and pH in tropical lakes. Overall, these results indicated great differences in annual dynamics of rotifer communities and their driving factors among warm temperate, subtropical and tropical zones.

Aquatic macrophyte community shifts in five shallow lakes in Sibley County, Minnesota	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC PLANT MANAGEMENT												The aquatic macrophyte community is one of the driving factors that affects the structure and function of freshwater systems. The shallow lakes of Sibley County, Minnesota, have been understudied and the purpose of this study was to describe aquatic macrophyte communities in these lakes and document seasonal changes in community structure in the presence of aquatic invasive plants. Entire lake surveys were conducted on all five lakes using the point-intercept method in both the early growing season and late growing season in 2019. The dominant native macrophyte in Sibley County lakes was sago pondweed [Stuckenia pectinata (L.) B o & BULL;erner], with one lake (Schilling Lake) being dominated by curlyleaf pondweed (Potamogeton crispus L.), at least during the early season. Significant shifts in the macrophyte community were found in nearly every lake, and the shifts differed depending on the species composition and the presence or absence of aquatic invasive species. Schilling Lake had the greatest change in mean species richness from 0.69 in the early season to 1.11 in the late season. The presence of curlyleaf pondweed in Schilling Lake was a primary driver for the community shift from early to late season. In Schilling Lake, curlyleaf pondweed had a frequency of 44.4% in the early season, which decreased to 13.9% in the late season. Conversely, sago pondweed had a frequency of 6.3% in the early season, which increased to 63.9% in the late season. Overall, all lakes in this study were relatively species-poor compared to other large lakes in southern Minnesota.

Agglomerations and decomposition of durian rind surrounding agro park caused air pollution and bad view in park areas. The decomposition of durian rind is very important to reduce those impacts. The micro composter model in Kampung Durian consisted of three main components. The first component was drying area with cemented ground. The drying area was set to accommodate 1 t fresh durian rind per day. The materials come from surrounding areas of agro park. The second was a machine house with one ton material capacity per day.

The detected concentrations of BPA, E2 alpha. E1, E2 beta, EE2 and E3 in lake water were 4.02 similar to 10.51ng/L, 0.73 similar to 24.53ng/L, 2.40 similar to 6.52ng/L, 9.17 similar to 20.65ng/L, 7.83 similar to 26.63 ng/L and 0.85 similar to 57.44ng/L during the dry season, respectively, while the EEQs ranged 25.94 similar to 74.84ng/L. Compared with dry season, under the influence of initial rain, the EEQs increased by 57%. PNEC-based ecological risk assessment results showed that except BPA was at moderate risk, steroid EDCs were almost at high risk whether in dry or rainy season. EDCs content in sediments ranges were 3.66 similar to 59.33 mu g/kg, nd similar to 17.65 mu g/kg, 22.21 similar to 181.40 mu g/kg, 8.11 similar to 79.30 mu g/kg, nd similar to 26.33 mu g/kg nd similar to 12.28 mu g/kg for BPA, E2 alpha, E1, E2 beta, EE2 and E3, respectively. The highest concentration section was located near the outlet of the Erhai Lake as the result of the deep lake water and the long process of EDCs deposition. By comparing the distribution characteristics of EDCs with COD, nitrogen and phosphorus, we found that E2 alpha, E2 beta, E3 and EE2 were closely related to soluble total nitrogen, probably mainly from agricultural non-point source pollution during dry season. However, in rainy season, EDCs in Erhai Lake were more affected by runoff.

Operational Impacts of a Water Management Structure on the Surrounding Fish Assemblages in a Restored Backwater and a Large Floodplain River	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												Water management structures (WMS) are used to regulate water levels between large floodplain river backwaters and their adjacent river systems offering a balance between maintaining quality backwater habitat and providing benefits to the river systems. The design and operation of these WMS is dependent on unique management goals, and their impacts on the surrounding ecosystem arc understudied. From 2016-2018 we quantified the response of the surrounding fish assemblages (i.e., backwater and river abundance and composition) to the WMS operation at the Emiquon Preserve, a 2723 ha restored floodplain lake located adjacent to the main channel of the Illinois River, U.S.A. Environmental conditions were recorded, and fish were collected using boat electrofishing on both sides of the WMS under three operational levels: closed and no flow, gravity flowing water, and mechanically pumping water to the river. Multivariate analyses detennined that there was no difference in fish community composition within the Emiquon Preserve among operation levels. Within the river there were differences in community composition when the WMS was closed and mechanically pumping water. Environmental parameters varied seasonally and WMS operation level varied but indicated an increase in chlorophyll-a in the river when the WMS was mechanically pumping water, although the chlorophyll-a decreased within 200 m downstream of the WMS in the Illinois River. This study suggests that managed connections between restored backwater and habitats operated like this WMS have variable, spatially isolated impacts on fish communities despite supplying chlorophyll-a to large river ecosystems.					; Casper, Andrew/B-3179-2013	Whitten Harris, Andrya/0000-0003-0045-7812; 													0003-0031	1938-4238				JAN	2021	185	1					120	138		10.1637/0003-0031-185.1.120	http://dx.doi.org/10.1637/0003-0031-185.1.120													WOS:000610397200008

Fish community structure associated with stabilized and unstabilized shoreline habitats, Coeur d'Alene River, Idaho, USA	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Stabilization of riverbanks and lake shorelines has become widely used to reduce erosion. Studies on effects of stabilization on fish species and communities have indicated highly variable effects from beneficial to detrimental. Bank stabilization implemented to reduce shoreline erosion of metals-contaminated sediments in the lower Coeur d'Alene River, Idaho, prompted concern of possible effects on the fish community. Fish sampling (electrofishing and gillnetting) and habitat assessment were conducted at 24 sites in the lower 54?km of river during 2005 and 2006 to assess differences in the fish community (relative abundance, species diversity and community composition) at stabilized and unstabilized shorelines. Within stabilized and unstabilized shorelines we evaluated seasonal differences as well as upstream and downstream differences. We captured 3511 fish from 17 species and 7 families; 83% of fish were captured by electrofishing. Fish relative abundance was significantly higher at stabilized than unstabilized sites for electrofishing. We also found positive correlations between relative abundance and diameter of rock at stabilized sites for both sampling gears. Three species (brown bullhead Ameiurus nebulosus, northern pike Esox lucius and pumpkinseed Lepomis gibbosus) were captured more readily at stabilized shoreline sites. Seasonally, the differences in relative abundance among habitat types indicate that stabilized structures are providing stable habitat year-round. Overall, stabilized shorelines on the lower Coeur d'Alene River were not found to be adversely affecting overall fish relative abundance, diversity and species composition under the existing low fraction (2.5%) of bank stabilization. Based on these results and reviews of other studies, we suggest that two factors affecting the results of bank stabilization studies are (i) the habitat quality of the unstabilized river, and (ii) the percentage of the river that has been stabilized.

Seasonal distribution of bloater (Coregonus hoyi) in the waters of Lake Huron surrounding the Bruce Peninsula	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Information about bloater (Coregonus hoyi) habitat in Lake Huron was limited to correlations between commercial yield and fishing depth, despite available information from other Great Lakes. We identified seasonal patterns of bloater habitat use in hypolimnetic waters surrounding the Bruce Peninsula, Lake Huron. We applied a delta-lognormal model to fisheries-independent survey data to evaluate whether bloater catch-per-unit-effort was related to depth, temperature, and bathymetric slope. A Bayesian variable selection technique indicated that bloater distribution was most strongly related to bottom depth and water temperature. Our study also reconfirmed a previously-described pattern of seasonal inshore movement during warmer months followed by a return to deeper offshore waters during cooler months. By focusing our sampling within the hypolimnion, we characterized intra-annual patterns of bloater habitat use with respect to a temperature gradient near the minimum thermal requirements reported for this species. Bloater distribution under these thermal conditions has not been previously reported. (C) 2012 International Association for Great Lakes Research. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Erikson, R				Erikson, R			Algal respiration and the regulation of phytoplankton biomass in a polymictic tropical lake (Lake Xolotlan, Nicaragua)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Community respiration in tropical Lake Xolotlan, Nicaragua, was assessed seasonally and during diurnal cycles, via oxygen consumption in bottle enclosures. Results were analysed in relation to phytoplankton biomass, mixing depth, depth of photic zone and phytoplankton production. A great part of community respiration was associated with the heterotrophic activity of the phytoplankton biomass or its degradation by bacteria and 80% of the variability in oxygen consumption was explained by the variation of chlorophyll-a. Specific rate of respiration was 1.5 mg O-2 mg Chla(-1) h(-1) during diurnal cycles, which corresponded to less than 5% of the specific rate at optimum depth of production. Still, diurnal water column respiratory losses were always of the same magnitude as the total photosynthetic gains in the photic zone, since the mixing depth exceeded the depth of the photic zone. Total column net growth was zero at a ratio between depth of photic zone and mixing depth of 0.19. Water level variations however altered the mixing depth and affected this ratio and net growth. As a consequence, the phytoplankton biomass either increased or decreased until the ratio was re-established through changes of the photic zone depth, which was governed by the phytoplankton biomass itself through the chlorophyll-a light attenuation.																			0018-8158						1998	382						17	25		10.1023/A:1003424802421	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003424802421													WOS:000078947000002
J	Kotut, K; Krienitz, L; Muthuri, FM				Kotut, K; Krienitz, L; Muthuri, FM			Temporal changes in phytoplankton structure and composition at the Turkwel Gorge Reservoir, Kenya	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Temporal changes in phytoplankton chlorophyll a, composition, diversity, biomass (density and fresh weight) and primary production were investigated at the Turkwel Gorge Reservoir (Kenya) over a two year period (1994 and 1995). The phytoplankton properties investigated revealed a seasonal pattern that was very distinct in 1994 and muted in 1995. The wet season was characterized by higher levels of chlorophyll a, biomass and primary production and a lower diversity. A prominent seasonality in 1994 was found to be the result of a higher river inflow volume as compared to 1995. Chlorophyll a changes showed some positive correlation to changes in total nitrogen and total phosphorus. Diversity changes were inversely correlated to changes in total counts (R = -0.84 and -0.96 for 1994 and 1995 respectively). Individual species density changes varied from a distinct seasonal pattern to a nearly uniform density. While the diatom Achnanthes dominated the wet season in 1994, coccoid blue green algae were dominant during most of 1995. Throughout the study period, most biomass was due to the diatoms but with a lower percentage of total biomass in 1995 (40%) as compared to 1994 (88%). The wet season biomass in each year was dominated by the diatoms. Dominance of the intervening period changed irregularly between diatoms, dinoflagellates, green algae and blue green algae. The range of variation in chlorophyll a, total biomass and primary production were; 4.9 to 36.8 mu g l(-1),440.14 to 11172.70 mg m(-3) and 1.85 to 9.67 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1) in 1994 and 4.9 to 11.5 mu g l(-1),486.46 to 1351.39 mg l(-1) and 3.08 to 5.41 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1) in 1995 in the same order.																			0018-8158						1998	368						41	59		10.1023/A:1003204922510	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003204922510													WOS:000076259700005

This potential is illustrated with a cluster analysis of paleofecal constituents from three late prehistoric period sites along the northern shore of ancient Lake Cahuilla, located in the Coachella Valley of southern California, These data were wed to test competing settlement/subsistence models: one of large permanent lakeside villages dependent on lacustrine resources, and the other of seasonal, rather than permanent, lakeshore occupation. In addition, rite analysis revealed additional details of diet and cuisine in the late prehistoric period.																			0002-7316	2325-5064				JAN	1998	63	1					86	107		10.2307/2694778	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2694778													WOS:000071904900007

Wittr. and Spirogyra sp, to nine combinations of temperature (15 degrees, 25 degrees, and 35 degrees C) and photon flux rate (50, 100, and 500 mu mol . m(-2). s(-1)) were determined using a three-factorial design. Maximum growth rates were measured at 35 degrees C and 500 mu mol . m(-2). s(-1) for P. oedogonia (0.247 d(-1)) and 25 degrees C and 500 mu mol . m(-2). s(-1) for Spirogyra sp. (0.224 d(-1)). Growth rates of P. oedogonia were strongly inhibited at 15 degrees C (average decrease = 89% of maximum rate), indicating that this species is warm stenothermal. Growth rates of Spirogyra sp were only moderately inhibited at 15 degrees and 35 degrees C (average decrease = 36 and 30%, respectively), suggesting that this species is eurythermal over the temperature range employed. Photon flux rate had a greater influence on growth of Spirogyra sp. (31% reduction at 50 mu mol . m(-2). s(-1) and 25 degrees C) than it did on growth of P. oedogonia (16% reduction at 50 mu mol . m(-2). s(-1) and 35 degrees C). Spirogyra sp. also exhibited much greater adjustments to its content of chlorophyll a (0.22-3.34 mu g . mg fwt(-1)) than did P. oedogonia (1.35-3.08 mu g . mg fwt(-1)). The chlorophyll a content of Spirogyra sp. increased in response to both reductions in photon flux rate and high temperatures (35 degrees C). Observed species differences are discussed with respect to in situ patterns of seasonal abundance in Surrey Lake, Indiana, the effect of algal mat anatomy on the internal light environment, and the process of acclimation to changes in temperature and irradiance conditions.																			0022-3646					OCT	1995	31	5					720	726		10.1111/j.0022-3646.1995.00720.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0022-3646.1995.00720.x													WOS:A1995TD90300006

Rhabdolaimus terrestris was the dominant of 120 examined species in Lake Konigssee, with high abundance in the littoral of the lake. Thirty-seven percent and 56% of all R. terrestris were found in 2 m and 5 m water depth, respectively. The proportion of R. terrestris of the total nematode fauna was 80% al 2 m and 74% at 5 m water depth. The seasonal variation shows greater abundance of the species in the warmer season than in the colder months. The highest abundance (8868 individuals per 100 cm(2)) was found in 5 m water depth in July. The mean abundance of R. terrestris was 434, 2767 and 4193 ind./100 cm(2) at 1, 2 and 5 m water depth, respectively. The mean biomass (fresh weight) was 0.037 mg/100 cm(2) at 1 m, 0.231 mg/100 cm(2) at 2 m and 0.339 mg/100 cm(2) at 5 m water depth. Of the 22,899 individuals sampled 12,292 were females (53.7%) and 10,606 individuals were juveniles (46.3%). Only one male was found. The vertical distribution of the species shows that about 60% of all individuals inhabit the top 0-2 cm of the sediment.

In each lake the macrozoobenthos density, biomass and community composition were determined monthly over one year in two contrasting littoral substrates (sandy-mineral sediments and clayey-organic sediments). The influence of the lake inundation regime on the macrozoobenthos abundance was tested against those of littoral substrate and season with a three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Between-lake variation in macrozoobenthos abundance was clear for Bivalvia, Ephemeroptera, Heteroptera and Trichoptera. Bivalvia (Pisidium sp.) were most abundant in the frequently flooded lake, Heteroptera [Micronecta sp., Sigara falleni (Fieber), S. striata (L.)] in the rarely flooded lake and Trichoptera [Mystacides longicornis (L.), M. nigra (L.)] and Ephemeroptera [Caenis horaria (L.), C. luctuosa Burmeister] in the isolated, non-flooded lake, suggesting an impact of inundation regime on the abundance of these dominant taxa in Lower Rhine floodplain lakes. In each lake the annual average abundance of macrozoobenthos was dominated by Gastropoda [Bithynia tentaculata (L.), Potamopyrgus antipodarum (Gray), Valvata piscinalis (Muller)]. Between-lake variations in the relative densities of macrozoobenthos functional feeding groups suggests an impact of the inundation regime on the macrozoobenthos communities via the availability of nutritional resources. Relative densities of filter-feeders (e.g. Pisidium sp.) were highest in the frequently flooded lake with its high phytoplankton biomass and poorly developed vegetation. Shredders (e.g. Mystacides sp.) were most numerous in the non-flooded lake with its well developed aquatic vegetation and low phytoplankton biomass. Within-lake variations in macrozoobenthos abundance could be attributed to littoral substrate and season. The importance of substrate on macrozoobenthos abundance was most clear for Oligochaeta and Trichoptera. The importance of season on macrozoobenthos abundance was clear for the total macrozoobenthos and for all taxonomic groups, except Oligochaeta. Correlations between the total macrozoobenthos abundance and seasonally fluctuating parameters, i.e. flood pulse duration, water level, water temperature and vegetational coverage in the lakes, suggest that hydrological parameters were most important in the frequently flooded lake, whereas vegetational coverage and water temperature were most important in the isolated, non-flooded lake.					van der Velde, Gerard/C-7776-2011														0886-9375					DEC	1994	9	4					279	293																WOS:A1994QF56500007

Densities of the calanoid copepods Calamoecia clitellata and C. salina, the small ostracods Diacypris compacta and D. dietzi, and juvenile ostracods (excluding A. insularis) were significantly reduced by A. insularis predation in the aquaria experiments. Daphniopsis sp. was only present (in low numbers) in the No Predator aquaria. Results from the large tank experiments were not as clear-cut, due to difficulties in the manipulation of predator numbers.

Specimens were collected monthly from North Bay, Mbita Island, Zambia for a year. Dentition was examined under a scanning electron microscope, stomach contents were analysed using the Index of Relative Importance (IRI) and mean Gonado-somatic Indices (GSI) were calculated for each month to reveal spawning peaks. Both males and females possess an outer row of six (premaxilla) and eight (dentary) enlarged canines. The remaining inner rows consist of small, recurved canine-like teeth. The lower pharyngeal bone possesses enlarged centrally placed molars with an increasing number of smaller bevelled teeth laterally. This dentition is very similar to a typical benthic arthropod and mollusc eater. Stomach content analysis revealed that L. ornatipinnis feeds predominantly on Chironomidae, Copepoda and Ostracoda. The importance of these prey items in the diet differed significantly between the months sampled. Percentage volume of Copepoda and Cyclopoida was greater in female stomachs than males and the % number of Chironomidae greater in males than females. Gonadosomatic Index (GSI) values indicated males and females breed throughout the year. Females, however have a significant peak (p < 0.05) in breeding activity from July to October that coincides with the increased abundance of plankton at this time.																			0378-1909					AUG	1999	55	4					431	441		10.1023/A:1007540121262	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1007540121262													WOS:000082086100011
J	Hoggarth, DD; Dam, RK; Debnath, K; Halls, AS				Hoggarth, DD; Dam, RK; Debnath, K; Halls, AS			Recruitment sources for fish stocks inside a floodplain river impoundment in Bangladesh	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												The sources of fish recruitment in the hydrologically modified, impounded Pabna Irrigation and Rural Development Project (PIRDP) flood control and irrigation scheme in NW Bangladesh were investigated. Catches at sluice gates were analysed to determine the migratory behaviour of fish. Fish attempted to migrate through the undershot sluice gates when they were opened, both with and against the currents, and both in and out of the PIRDP. Many fish were caught by the fishermen at such locations, but it is argued that some fish were probably able to enter the PIRDP from outside. One to two percentage of fish survived the dry season at the PIRDP, mostly in the deeper, perennial water bodies, both in rivers and lakes, and both inside and outside the flood control scheme, Fewer species survived inside the scheme, and the numbers of species remaining declined as the dry season progressed. It was shown in companion papers that fish production inside the PIRDP was lower than outside in both 1995 and 1996 even though the growth and reproductive potential of individual fish were at least as good inside as outside. The apparently negative impact of the PIRDP was explained by the reduced accessibility of the scheme to some migrant fish, as reflected by the inside/outside species compositions. It was concluded that fish catches within the PIRDP are sustained mainly from recruits produced by residing annual populations, while the biodiversity of the stocks was augmented by limited recruitment of fish migrating through the sluice gates from external sources. Two management approaches were proposed for increasing recruitment to the impounded PIRDP fishery as cheap alternatives to fish stocking: the use of dry season reserves to protect the residing spawning stocks; and the management of flood control sluice gates to maximise recruitment from external sources.																			0969-997X					AUG	1999	6	4					287	310		10.1111/j.1365-2400.1999.tb00081.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2400.1999.tb00081.x													WOS:000082728700002

Population changes were monitored over two growing seasons using pitfall traps baited with ethanol and turpentine in Christmas tree farms. Density-dependent factors affected population change, particularly among H. pales. The number of weevils per trap did not vary consistently across three pitfall trap densities. Weevil distribution patterns, and correlations between trap catch and damage, were analyzed. Trap catch in 1988 of female H. pales was positively correlated with infestation level and infestation severity in 1988, 1989, and 1990. Trap catch in 1989 of P. picivorus was significantly correlated with 1988, 1989, and 1990 foliar symptoms. The role of host finding with respect to weevil distribution, the significance of the trap catch-damage relationship, and the predictive potential of the monitoring system are discussed.																			0022-0493					APR	1993	86	2					475	485		10.1093/jee/86.2.475	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/86.2.475													WOS:A1993KW12400043

The results indicate that about 47.63% of the study region was suitable to accommodate L. Relictus during their breeding/resting season, while 27.08% proved to be highly unsuitable for this species. Based on the spatial distribution of the statistical data already incorporated into the GIS environment, it was observed that regions surrounding the Bojiang Lake (especially polygons 38 and 42) dominated by low vegetation and increased amount of moisture proved to be the best region for this species. On the contrary, polygon 23, located in the southern part of the study region proved to be the worst region for this species being dominated by significantly high amount of threat factors having the highest mean normalized hierarchical value and ranking 60th out of 61 in terms of standard deviation. To distinctively capture different suitability level of the study region, we could say that the application of this technique is quite effective and beneficial. This is because, compared to other decision making tools, this technique which solely relies on remote sensing and vector data gives decision makers an option of weight application if so desired.

Fjordic Lagoons of the Barents Sea as Models for Study of the Dynamics of Coastal Communities with Alien Red King Crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus, Decapoda, Lithodidae)	BIOLOGY BULLETIN												Benthic communities of the semi-isolated deep fjordic Linjalampi and Sisajarvi lagoons in the apex part of Ambarnaya Bay, Varanger fjord, Barents Sea, are affected by the limited water exchange and wave action in combination with other abiotic and biotic factors. Among the biotic factors, the presence of a numerous group of red king crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus) that naturalized in the southern part of the Barents Sea in the second half of the 20th century may play a particularly important role. The median density of juvenile and adult crabs in the lagoons (42.5-52 specimens/1000 m(2) in most years of observation) is comparable to their density in the neighboring open parts of the Varanger fjord. A narrow and shallow strait connecting the lagoons with the sea may restrict crab migrations between these habitats. Thus, adult crabs are present in the lagoons in the seasons when they migrate from the coast to greater depths in their usual habitats. The food chains starting from phytoplankton and macrophytes to benthic predators, red king crabs, spider crabs (Hyas araneus), and hermit crabs (Pagurus pubescens) have been studied using stable isotope analysis. The trophic level of adult king crabs in the lagoons (2.88) is lower than that of both spider crabs (3.16-3.42) and those king crabs that occur in the open part of the coastal area (3.44). This indicates differences in the feeding habits of crabs in the lagoons and in the open coastal waters. The food chain kelp-sea urchins-red king crabs typical for the coastal zone in the Barents Sea is not expressed in the food web of the lagoons. The low abundance and distribution patterns of sea urchins may be due to their consumption by red king crabs over a long period. Although fjordic Linjalampi and Sisajarvi lagoons are full marine water bodies, they are similar to continental lakes in some characteristics. In particular, the conditions in the lagoons make them convenient models for the study of the long-term dynamics of communities and ecosystems.

Greatest average daily movements occurred during June, May, and February; the smallest were in August. Several largemouth bass migrated during the spawning season as far as 3 km from their home ranges to wave-protected sites within canals. Largemouth bass were often located in small areas of their home range and occupied panic grasses Panicum spp., stands of cattails Typha sp., and spatterdock Nuphar luteum more often than other available vegetation types and open water. A segment of the largemouth bass population remained offshore: 36% of the tagged fish were at least 10 m from shore 25% of the time. Studies such as this should facilitate identification of habitat use by fish, projection of realistic harvest rates, and formulation of predator stocking policies and fishing regulations.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				MAR	1986	115	2					286	295		10.1577/1548-8659(1986)115<286:HRSMAH>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1986)115<286:HRSMAH>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1986C634500014
J	PACE, ML				PACE, ML			ZOOPLANKTON COMMUNITY STRUCTURE, BUT NOT BIOMASS, INFLUENCES THE PHOSPHORUS CHLOROPHYLL A RELATIONSHIP	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Simultaneous observations were made of total P (TP), chlorophyll a (Chl a) and zooplankton biomass and community structure at 12 sites in the Eastern Townships (ET) region of Quebec [Canada] to determine if zooplankton parameters reduced residual variation in the TP-Chl a relationship. Similar data from 3 stations in Lake Memphremagog and the literature were also analyzed. Zooplankton biomass was not significant in explaining residual variation in the TP-Chl a relationship of any data set studied. The mean body size of cladocerans was also not a significant additional variable in a TP-Chl a model based on the seasonal mean values in the ET lakes, but cladoceran body size was a significant factor in 13 lakes of the Indian River district of New York [USA]. The difference between these results is attributed to the rarity of large daphnids in the ET lakes. An index of zooplankton community structure derived from the slope of log abundance-log weight regressions was significant in explaining residual variation in TP-Chl a relationships for the among- and within-lake data and improved the predictive capability of TP-Chl a models. Lakes with higher concentrations of macrozooplankton relative to microzooplankton have less Chl a per unit TP. These results extended the generality of the hypothesis that large zooplankton differentially reduce Chl a relative to TP. In the ET lakes the effect of zooplankton size structure, was weak and this suggests that manipulation of zooplankton community structure to manage algal biomass may be of limited value in many lakes.

There was no difference (P > 0.05) in mean bacterial volume between Redberry Lake (0.084 +/- 0.034 mum3 SD) and Humboldt Lake (0.083 +/- 0.021 mum3 SD). Statistical analyses suggested there were marked differences in the factors associated with the pronounced seasonality of bacterial cell volumes in these two lakes. Variance in bacterial volume in the epilimnion of Redberry Lake was best explained by a multivariate regression model which included ciliate abundance and chlorophyll concentration (r2 = 0.96). The model accounting for changes in hypolimnetic bacterial volume included ciliate numbers and primary production (r2 = 0.94), of the measured variables. Bacterial volume in Humboldt Lake was most highly correlated with primary production (r2 = 0.59). Bacterial production (estimated as the rate of thymidine incorporation into DNA) and growth (thymidine incorporation rate normalized to cell numbers) were not correlated to cell volume, with the exception of cocci volume in Humboldt Lake.

Dynamics of seasonal plant growth in halophytic meadows taking into account the temperature factor and soil salinity level	BIOLOGY BULLETIN												A mathematical model has been constructed to describe the growth dynamics of various plant communities of halophytic meadows depending on the temperature factor and degree of soil salinity. Field investigation of the yields of halophytic meadow plant communities were performed in the coastal area of Kurinka Lake in the Altaiskii district of the Republic of Khakasia in 2004 and 2006. The results of field investigations and model studies show that there is a correlation between plant growth and air temperature for plant communities growing on soils with the lowest and medium salinity levels. It was proven in model studies that for the plant communities that grow on highly saline (3.58%) soils, not only air temperature but also the salinity level of the soil should be taken into account.

A national overview and regional examination of treatment effects	ANNALS OF APPLIED BIOLOGY												Bracken control field experiments were conducted at six locations across Great Britain. The effects of various cutting and herbicide management regimes upon the seasonal dynamics of bracken fronds and rhizomes were examined over a three year period. This enabled a national overview towards bracken control to be constructed. Initially, spraying with asulam was the most effective treatment in reducing frond biomass and density but was least effective in reducing rhizome biomass. Differential reductions in rhizome biomass were observed in relation to cutting frequency, with cutting twice yearly giving superior control. The national trends confirmed a number of previous observations from independent single-site studies; however, others were contradicted. Comparable management options were ranked consistently between the current and former investigation, however, the initial importance of differences in cutting frequencies did not agree between studies. This multiple-site study improves understanding of the consequences of a national bracken control programme by reducing the influence of confounding site-specific factors, and recommendations for the most appropriate bracken control techniques are made. The extent to which individual sites reflect a national trend in response to bracken control is considered and sites are compared. The hierarchy of treatments identified at the national scale was found to apply generally within individual sites. However, several responses which proved significant at the countrywide level were not so clearly defined at the site scale. Cutting once yearly was the only management regime which appeared to give different bracken control between sites. All other treatments gave similar responses between sites. This result was found in the Scottish Borders, during the second year of control, when frond biomass and density (relative to untreated plots) were greater than that recorded at other sites. This contrast was not found in subsequent monitoring. In terms of rhizome biomass depletion, poorer control was achieved following cutting once yearly at the northern sites (Mull, Scottish Borders, Lake District) compared with the southern sites (Clwyd, Breckland, Devon). The implications of experimental results are discussed in relation to increased cost effectiveness of national bracken control programmes.

Three generations of stromatolites are observed, the more recent ones frequently covering pebbles and boulders eroded from the older ones. The youngest one yielded 14C ages ranging from approximately 12,000 to 10,000 yr B.P. Their .delta.13C values (.mchgt. 2.6.permill.) suggest isotopic equilibrium between the paleolake total inorganic dissolved carbon and the atmospheric CO2, thereby lending credence to the reliability of the 14C. An initial 230Th/232Th ratio in the detrital component was determined by Th/U measurements on the 14C dated stromatolites. Using this value a 230Th/234U chronology for the older stromatolites was calculated. Ages of .mchgt. 240,000 and 135,000 .+-. 10,000 yr were obtained for the first and second generations, respectively. A humid episode apparently characterized eastern Africa during each glacial-interglacial transition. 18O and 13C measurements on stromatolites, when compared to values on modern waters and carbonates, provide paleohydrological information. Long residence time of the paleolake waters and less seasonally contrasted regimes are inferred.																			0033-5894	1096-0287				MAY	1986	25	3					312	329		10.1016/0033-5894(86)90004-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0033-5894(86)90004-9													WOS:A1986C330400004

Large scale trawling on inland waters in this area is a new phenomenon and it has caused conflicts between different fishing groups. It has generally been assumed that undersized trout freed after being caught in trawls do not survive. Blood lactate and glucose concentrations and plasma chloride concentrations were measured from blood samples taken immediately after trawling. The recovery of the fish from trawling stress was also monitored by blood sampling and following the mortality of fish caged for 7 days after capture. The trout were observed to become considerably stressed by trawling. Abundant catch and high water temperature increased stress of the trout. These variables and the duration of trawling haul as well as the cod end emptying technique explained 72% of the increase of blood lactate. The indicators of stress had not returned to control values by 4 h post-capture, but blood lactate showed an abrupt decrease over 2 h. Plasma chloride concentration was, however, still decreasing 4 h after the end of trawling. The percentage of caged fish which survived a week was 85.5. Lifting of the cod end to the vessel clearly increased the mortality of trout. Without the extra stress connected with caging, the proportion of surviving fish would probably have been considerably greater. On the basis of the results it can be said that if undersized trout were freed immediately by emptying the cod end in small portions directly in the water, trawling would not cause them considerable mortality.																			0165-7836					FEB	1994	19	1-2					51	64		10.1016/0165-7836(94)90014-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0165-7836(94)90014-0													WOS:A1994MY25200004

This fishery occurs in specific places in the lake and uses rudimentary methods and equipment. According to the fisherman, production is influenced by environmental variables and by the use of guild nets, that the fishermen say drives away peacock bass from the fishing environments. The use of environments for fishing is the main source of conflict among fisherman.

Seasonal variation and species composition of crustacean zooplankton (Order: Cladocera) in Manchhar lake, Sindh, Pakistan	PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Qualitative and quantitative studies of crustacean zooplankton were carried out during 2001, when drought conditions prevailed. Ten species belonging to 9 genera and 4 families of order Cladocera were identified. Out of 10 species, 01 species Dunhevedia crassa is a new record from Pakistan. Enumeration of zooplankton indicated that the population of Alona rectangula and Dunhevedia crassa increased gradually during colder months (December-March). Alona rectangula peaked in February, while Dunhevedia crassa had two peaks, in December and March. Bosmina longirostris and Ceriodaphnia reticulata did not show any remarkable changes during the year. Chydorus poppei and Simocephalus exspinosus increased during warmer months. Chydorus poppei had a peak in May, while the peak of Simocephalus exspinosus was observed in July. Highest population of Macrothrix rosea was found in August, and then it decreased gradually during colder months. Population of Scapholeberis kingi remained low throughout the year, but exhibited peaks in September and March. Seasonal fluctuation of cladocerans can be correlated with the temperature and salinity of water. As the temperature and salinity decreased in colder months, the over all population of Cladocerans increased with a peak in February.

J	Bell, FG; Coulthard, JM				Bell, FG; Coulthard, JM			A survey of some geotechnical properties of the Tees Laminated Clay of central Middlesbrough, North East England	ENGINEERING GEOLOGY												The Tees Laminated Clay was deposited in a proglacial lake which occupied the Teesside area during late Devensian times, disappearing about 13 000 y ago. The laminations consist of alternating thin layers of clay and silt, and represent seasonal increments of sediment. Fissuring is common in the upper few metres of the laminated clays, which reach a maximum thickness in parts of central Middlesbrough of just over 9 m. Illite and kaolinite, with lesser amounts of chlorite, dominate the mineral composition. Quartz tends to account for less than 30%. The notable carbonate content may be diagenetic in origin. The birefringence ratio of the clay minerals indicates a medium degree of particle orientation which suggests a partially flocculated fabric. These laminated clays have a high plasticity. However, the liquid and plastic limits of the silty layers differ significantly from those of the clay layers or the bulk samples. The clay fraction has a greater influence on these limits than the silty fraction. In addition, the linear shrinkage, liquidity indices and consistency indices of the silty layers differ appreciably from those of the clay layers and the bulk samples. The clays are inactive. The orientation of the laminations in relation to the direction of maximum principal stress influences the shear strength, the lowest strengths being developed when these orientations are between 30 degrees and 60 degrees. The stress paths, anisotropic ratios and values of A, indicate that the Tees Laminated Clay is normally consolidated or lightly overconsolidated. The McLamore-Gray concept possibly can be applied to the anisotropic strength behaviour.

J	REEDER, BC				REEDER, BC			ESTIMATING THE ROLE OF AUTOTROPHS IN NONPOINT-SOURCE PHOSPHORUS RETENTION IN A LAURENTIAN GREAT-LAKES COASTAL WETLAND	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Primary productivity of a plankton/Nelumbo lutea freshwater marsh (56 ha) with intermittent hydrologic links to Lake Erie (Ohio, USA) was determined in order to estimate the role of autotrophs in phosphorus uptake. Water column gross primary productivity, as measured by the diurnal oxygen technique, averaged 6.5 g O2 m-2 day-1 for 80 measurements during the growing season. This productivity could account for the uptake of 8600 kg P/year (15 g P m-2 year-1). Chlorophyll a concentrations (which averaged 157 mg m-3 throughout the study period) suggest a phosphorus retention of 5500 kg P/year (10 g P m-2 year-1). Nelumbo lutea, which covered about 23% of the wetland and averaged 125 g m-2 above-ground dry weight at peak biomass, was estimated to be responsible for transforming approximately only 61 kg P/year (0.1 g P.m-2 year-1) of phosphorus. A barrier beach system, which generally restricts the wetland's connection to Lake Erie during the periods of highest nonpoint source phosphorus loading, combined with the high planktonic productivity, suggest an excellent ecological engineering design for constructed or restored coastal wetlands to protect the Laurentian Great Lakes from nonpoint phosphorus runoff.																			0925-8574					JUN	1994	3	2					161	169		10.1016/0925-8574(94)90043-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0925-8574(94)90043-4													WOS:A1994NR51800033

A majority of chlorophyll resided in the metalimnion in late July, with metalimnetic populations dominated by diatoms (Cyclotella bodanica) and chrysophytes (Mallomonas caudata, Dinobryon sertularia). A silica gradient appeared to be most important in determining the vertical position of these populations. Later in the season, segregation of nutrients and light, in the face of a deepening epilimnion, led to transient accumulations of phytoplankton at the top of the metalimnion. It appeared that losses due to heterotrophic activities accentuated the lower boundary of this chlorophyll peak.																			0142-7873					FEB	1996	18	2					225	237		10.1093/plankt/18.2.225	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/18.2.225													WOS:A1996TW46400007

However, the relationships between strategic groups changed with the time scale involved. At the daily scale an inverse relationship between r- and K-groups occurred whereas at supradaily scales such relationships did not hold. Species groups reflected strategic groups. No relationship between population growth and losses was found, suggesting that both were not counterbalanced. In the long term (supraannual) the phytoplankton community changed very much in this reservoir, its ecological memory being small as compared with that of lakes.

J	WHITFIELD, AK				WHITFIELD, AK			FISH LARVAL COMPOSITION, ABUNDANCE AND SEASONALITY IN A SOUTHERN AFRICAN ESTUARINE LAKE	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												The ichthyoplankton community of Swartvlei [South Africa] an estuarine lake on the southern Cape coast, has a low species diversity (< 10 species) owing to the tenous link with the marine environment and paucity of fishes breeding in South African estuaries. The larval assemblage was dominated by the clupeid Gilchristella aestuaria, which was distributed across the entire lake and comprised 78% of the total catch. mean annual ichthyoplankton abundance was relatively low (38 larvae 100 m-3), possibly as a result of the extremely low phytoplankton productivity and poor zooplankton biomass. Fish larvae and zooplankton peak in abundance between October and march, with very low densities recorded for the remainder of the year. During a 24 h sampling session in February 1988, ichthyoplankton abundance increased significantly (p < 0,001) in surface waters after sunset and declined following sunrise.

One of the pelagic non-indigenous species of concern in the recent history of aquatic bioinvasions is the predatory cladoceran Cercopagis pengoi, which invaded the Baltic Sea in the early 1990s. While several studies have reported immediate declines in abundances of its potential prey, the long-term effects of C. pengoi on the food webs remain to be examined. Based on the long-term time series (1968-2018) in the Gulf of Riga (Baltic Sea), we found significant declines in abundance of the cladoceran Pleopis spp. and copepod Eurytemora affinis by 90 and 80%, respectively, are associated with the invasion of C. pengoi as well as significant alterations in seasonal abundance patterns of Pleopis spp., E. affinis and cladoceran Bosmina spp. The invasion of the non-indigenous predator has led to the changed prey abundance-temperature relationships. Special caution was taken in data preprocessing, to minimize the likelihood that observed changes in the zooplankton prey could be associated with factors other than the invasion of C. pengoi, such as temperature and storminess.					; Klais, Riina/G-6123-2010; Einberg, Heli/KMA-2829-2024; Ojaveer, Henn/K-2160-2016	Klais-Peets, Riina/0000-0003-2895-1273; Einberg, Heli/0000-0002-4045-5101; Ojaveer, Henn/0000-0003-2742-6063													0142-7873	1464-3774				NOV-DEC	2020	42	6					714	726		10.1093/plankt/fbaa048	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbaa048													WOS:000595482600009

During the years 1986-1988 a total of 162 calves were ear-tagged, weighed monthly and monitored closely for TBDs and endoparasitism. The mean (+/-SD) body weighs at 4 months, 8 months and 12 months were 35 +/- 7 kg, 47 +/- 10 kg and 61 +/- 12 kg, respectively. The average growth rate from birth to 12 months of age was 120 g day-1, but there were significant effects of year, season of birth and farm on calf liveweight gain. Calf mortality from birth to 12 months of age was high, ranging from 17 to 56% among farms, and averaging 33%. Twenty one percent of mortalities were diagnosed as due to East Coast fever (ECF) and 14% as due to endoparasites. The average annual ECF incidence rate was 22% and the ECF case fatality rate 21%, but these deaths were recorded on only two of the ten monitored farms. Forty-nine percent of dams had one or more damaged teats due to the tick species Amblyomma variegatum. Attempts were made using this small data set to analyse for effects of ECF and number of damaged teats on calf performance but no statistically significant effects could be demonstrated.

A large portion of the water-soluble SO4 in these soils is not derived from soil water, but is apparently desorbed from the soil matrix. A HCO3-exchange procedure extracts even more sorbed SO4, especially from the acidic Podzol B horizon. The SO4 in these soils has a range in delta-S-34 values similar to that of atmospheric SO4 input. In contrast, the delta-O-18 (avg. +4 to +8.5) values of the soil SO4 are depleted by 2-9 parts per thousand relative to atmospheric SO4 input (delta-O-18 = +11 to +13) due to rapid biological cycling of soil S. This cycling includes biological assimilation of SO4 and production of secondary SO4, which is depleted in O-18. Calculations based on delta-O-18 data of litter leaching experiments indicate that approximately 50-100% of seepage SO4 in the LFH and B horizons at Plastic Lake, central Ontario, is secondary. Biological cycling apparently exerts an important control on net release or retention of S by soils. Seasonal variations in soil water evaporation and litterfall may be important factors affecting the delta-O-18 of soil SO4, and may be partly responsible for the 10 parts per thousand seasonal shift in delta-O-18 of LFH horizon SO4.

Altogether 158 nests were documented at a monospecific breeding colony for both seasons combined. The breeding season occurred between November and April. Nest construction started from the middle of November and it took 8.2 +/- 2.5 d on average to complete a nest (n = 158 nests, range = 5-13 d). All the nests were build inside clusters of Papyrus Cyperus madagascariensis. The nest density was 0.31 nests m-2 and 0.20 nests m-2 for Season 1 and Season 2, respectively. Egg laying took place between November and January, but it continued throughout February for renesting attempts (second clutches laid). Mean clutch size was 2.9 +/- 0.68 eggs (n = 158, range = 2-4). Incubation started with the laying of the first egg, producing an asynchronous hatching. The incubation period averaged 20.6 +/- 0.9 d (n = 158, range = 20-22 d). Of the 461 eggs laid in 158 nests, 399 (86.6%) hatched, and 326 (70.7%) of those hatchlings fledged, a reproductive success of 2.06 fledglings per nesting attempt. Data obtained from 34 measured nestlings showed a rapid growth of all measured biometric parameters, except for tarsus length. The mean daily growth rate was 9.02 g for body mass, 9.64 mm for body size length, 10.66 mm for wing length and 2.35 mm for tarsus length. Significant differences were recorded in growth rates between nestlings in the same brood in relation to their hatching sequence. The last nestlings to hatch had lower growth rates for all measured parameters than their older siblings.						Pruvot, Yverlin Z.

J	Hepdeniz, K				Hepdeniz, Kerem			Determination of Burdur Lake's areal change in upcoming years using geographic information systems and the artificial neural network method	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES					4th International Conference on Computational and Experimental Science and Engineering (ICCESEN)	OCT 04-08, 2017	Antalya, TURKEY					Burdur Lake is a closed basin lake situated between the provinces of Burdur and Isparta that was formed as a result of the tectonic depression filling with water. It is Turkey's seventh largest lake in terms of area and the third largest among salt lakes. Due to the nature of the lake water, a limited number of aquatic creatures live in this lake, and the lake also has international significance in terms of endemic bird species. The water level in Burdur Lake, which is very important in terms of the population, agriculture, animal husbandry, and endemic plant species in the region, has been dropping since 1971. The lake relies on rains, seasonal and continuous streams, and groundwater as sources. The dams built on streams feeding the lake are not sufficient as sources due to agricultural activities and wells around the lake. In this study, the changes in the lake area were determined with the geographic information systems program using the satellite images between 1984 and 2016. The area changes for the lake area from 2020 to 2040 were determined with the artificial neural network program, using the average temperature, relative humidity, and precipitation data from the Burdur meteorology station for the same years as input data and the changes in the lake area as output data. In present study, it was predicted that the lake will shrink to approximately 87.2 km(2) by 2040 if the current conditions continue. This shows that Burdur Lake, which is a salty lake, will be more saline, and this situation will affect the habitat negatively. This result, which was revealed by using the geographic information systems and artificial neural network methods together, is intended to be a guide for local administrations and planners in the region.																			1866-7511	1866-7538				OCT 25	2020	13	21							1143	10.1007/s12517-020-06137-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12517-020-06137-5													WOS:000586456300002

Samples were taken seasonally from 4 sampling stations. A total of 212 taxa belonging to 6 divisions have been identified, including Chlorophyta (35.38 % of taxa), Euglenophyta (29.25 %), Bacillariophyta (18.40 %), Cyanoprocaryota (10.85 %), Xanthophyta (5.19 %) and Pyrrhophyta (2.36 %). The greatest species richness was found in the central zone at S3 (205 taxa) and the smallest was recorded in the upper zone at station S1 (165 taxa). In the remaining stations were collected 173 (S2) and 195 (S4) taxa. At all the stations, the phytoplankton community was typically dominated by the pelagic-benthic species of Bacillariophyta (17 taxa) and pelagic species of Euglenophyta (43 taxa) and Chlorophyta (41 taxa). Spatio-temporal patterns of phytoplankton groups showed that Euglenophyta and Chlorophyta were permanent groups whatever the stations and seasons except stations S1 and S2 in long rainy season, where Chlorophyta accounted for 9.1 and 12.5 % of sporadic taxa respectively.

The results indicated that the lake water had higher aminopeptidase activities than endopeptidase activities except in November and December, whereas lake water filtrated using membranes with a pore size of 0.2 mu m showed higher endopeptidase activities than aminopeptidase activities from June to December, with peaks in June and November. The serial aminopeptidase activity profile was relatively similar to that of the chlorophyll-a concentration. The size distribution of aminopeptidase activities indicated that half of the total activity was retained in the fraction between 5 and 100 mu m. These results suggest that phytoplankton participate in the digestion of peptides with aminopeptidase activities. Electrophoretic analysis detected the presence of three peptidase bands (1, 2, and 3) in the lake water that passed through the 0.2-mu m membranes. Samples from June, September, and November dominantly contained these active bands in different electrophoretic profiles.																			1439-8621	1439-863X				APR	2012	13	1					125	130		10.1007/s10201-011-0364-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-011-0364-2													WOS:000301482900013

Results showed that physicochemical variables changed among sites and seasons, but remained consistent with regulations for inland fisheries of the region. Cluster and multidimensional scaling analyses indicated that the physicochemical variables, macrobenthos and nekton communities primarily changed between study sites, while plankton communities predominantly varied with season. The correlation between physicochemical variables and biotic communities confirmed the relevance of these variables listed in the water quality standard for maintaining aquatic diversity. However, the relevance of some variables (e.g. conductivity, salinity) not listed among the standard variables was also confirmed, which implies that those variables should also be regularly monitored in estuaries like the PPRB. The comparison of nekton diversity figures before and after dam construction revealed a decrease, particularly in brackish and marine species, but, on the other hand, there was an increase among freshwater fish species which was reflected in diversity indices when comparing the most recent indices to those of 2003 (4 years after dam construction). These results indicate an improvement in the biodiversity of freshwater species that was consistent with findings on the suitability of the physicochemical conditions of the freshwater fishing area of the PPRB.					; Ikejima, Kou/AAE-6927-2020; Gallardo, Wenresti/AAZ-2893-2021	Ikejima, Kou/0000-0003-3935-8475; Gallardo, Wenresti/0000-0003-4494-3425; 													1350-4509					APR	2012	19	2					172	188		10.1080/13504509.2011.609567	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13504509.2011.609567													WOS:000303143600006

J	Yagi, A				Yagi, A			Manganese flux associated with dissolved and suspended manganese forms in Lake Fukami-ike	WATER RESEARCH												Redissolved, particulate and sedimentary manganese were studied in the anoxic hypolimnion of the small monomictic Lake Fukami-ike in central Japan. The amounts of particulate and dissolved manganese in the water column were observed. The release of dissolved manganese starts gradually beginning in March. DMn reaches especially high levels of 93 mgMn m(-2)d(-1) from the end of May to the end of June calculated from the gradient of a regression formula for the daily change in DMn. The rate of accumulated PMn is 0.64 mgMn m(-2)d(-1) from the end of July calculated from the gradient of a regression formula for the daily change in PMn. An accumulation of PMn and an associated decrease in dissolved organic carbon (DOG) were observed at the transition zone of oxic and anoxic layers. These facts seem to suggest that the DOC decrease involves the consumption of DOC as an electron donor by bacterial catalysis For the reduction of MnO2. The upward and downward DOC fluxes, 0.320 mmolC m(-2)d(-1), were calculated by the mean gradient values of the upward and downward DOC concentrations. The mean DOC flux was calculated by both the mean gradient DOC and the vertical diffusion coefficient (0.0304 m(-2)d(-1)). Manganese-reducing bacteria could contribute as much as 24% to the DOC decrease in the oxic and anoxic layers, considering bacterial assimilation efficiency (64%). Vertical diffusion Mn Bur from the interstitial water to the hypolimnion is then assumed to be 2 mgMn m(-2)d(-1). Mn for the vertical eddy diffusion flux, the vertical diffusion flux from interstitial water of the bottom sediment, the sinking flux and microbiological Mn flux were obtained, and the biogeochemical manganese cycle in Lake Fukami-ike was calculated. DMn flux in the oxic and anoxic layers by manganese-reducing bacteria is 0.004 gMn m(-2)d(-1), a value corresponding to 10% of DMn Aux.

J	Loiselle, PV				Loiselle, PV			Fishes of the fresh waters of Nosy Be, Madagascar, with notes on their distribution and natural history	ICHTHYOLOGICAL EXPLORATION OF FRESHWATERS												An inventory of the fishes of the island of Nosy Be, Madagascar was conducted in 1994, 1995 and 2001. Pachypanchax omalonotus (Aplocheilidae) is the only freshwater fish found in the island's streams, whose ichthyofauna is dominated by amphidromous representatives of the families Ambassidae and Eleotridae and intrusive marine species. Amphidromous fishes also occur in three of the island's ten crater lakes, but three endemic representatives of the family Cichlidae, Paratilapia polleni, Paretroplus damii and Ptychochromis oligacanthus dominate Nosy Be's lacustrine fish communities. Five of the amphidromous species collected on Nosy Be are also present on the Comoros. The absence of amphidromous and catadromous species reported from both the Comoros and the mainland of Madagascar is most parsimoniously explained by the seasonal character of Nosy Be's streams. Although the recent anthropogenic deforestation of most of the island has negatively impacted the hydrological regime of its streams, the island's crater lakes still retain their limnological integrity and support significant populations of endemic fishes at risk on the mainland of Madgascar. Nosy Be offers an unparalleled opportunity for in situ conservation of endemic Malagasy fishes due to the absence of exotic predators, the feasibility of preventing their future introduction and unique socio-economic factors that favor addition of the Mont Passot crater lakes to Madagascar's network of protected areas.																			0936-9902					MAR	2005	16	1					29	46																WOS:000228420900004

Hence, an inventory of wetlands in any given area is a pre-requisite for their conservation and management. A study has been carried out to delineate the wetlands of east Champaran district of Bihar, India, using IRS 1D LISS III data. The data for the pre and post monsoon seasons have been analysed and the wetlands have been qualitatively characterized based on the turbidity and aquatic vegetation status. The extent of water logging problem in the study area was inferred from the seasonal variation of waterspread during both the seasons. The three categories of wetlands (ponds/lakes, water logged areas and oxbow lakes) have been identified. From the analysis, it has been observed that the inland wetlands constitute 2.7% of the study area, of which 1.8% is subjected to water logging. Thus, this study highlights the usefulness of remotely sensed data for wetland mapping, seasonal monitoring and characterization.																			0255-660X					MAR	2005	33	1					51	61																WOS:000207618200006

J	Tevesz, MJS; Barrera, E; Schwelgien, SF				Tevesz, MJS; Barrera, E; Schwelgien, SF			Seasonal variation in oxygen isotopic composition of two freshwater bivalves: Sphaerium striatinum and Anodonta grandis	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Oxygen isotopic values have been obtained from microsamples of the aragonitic freshwater bivalves Sphaerium striatinum (Pisidiidae) and Anodonta grandis (Unionidae) collected alive from Wellington Creek, OH. To test whether these organisms secrete their shell in isotopic equilibrium, the delta(18)O values of shell aragonite are compared to ambient water temperature and delta(18)O values monitored for > 1 yr. These bivalves were chosen for study because they are abundant in surface sediments and cores front Lake Erie where they represent a source of information on the environmental history of the lake. The observed mean values are -5.54 parts per thousand for A. grandis and -6.16 parts per thousand for S. striatinum. The mean delta(18)O value expected for bivalve aragonite if equilibrium precipitation is occurring during May-August in Wellington Creek is -5.69 parts per thousand. The similarity between measured and predicted isotopic values for both species suggests that they are useful sources of paleoenvironmental darn. Overall, the isotopic composition of the shells of the two species reflects less than one half of the calculated range of potential biogenic aragonite values for the stream and omits recording evaporative conditions associated with ponded water. Bivalve delta(18)O and delta(13)C data covary. The delta(13)C data are highly negative and values could reflect C-12 enrichment of dissolved organic carbon from organic matter oxidation and/or ingestion of food carbon.																			0380-1330						1996	22	4					906	916		10.1016/S0380-1330(96)71011-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(96)71011-0													WOS:A1996WD85300012

Values were variable within each species and interspecific differences in metal concentration were not significant over the season as a whole. Cadmium concentration increased during the season in Potamogeton foliosus and Myriophyllum exalbescens, while copper and lead declined in P. foliosus. No identifiable seasonal trends were seen in P. zosteriformis and P. robbinsii. In P. foliosus, copper and lead concentrations increased with water depth. Few significant correlations were found between metal concentrations in the shoots and each of several water chemistry parameters, temperature, and shoot chlorophyll, soluble sugar and starch content. Roots yielded greater metal concentration than shoots.																			0018-8158					DEC 10	1990	208	3					253	260		10.1007/BF00007790	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00007790													WOS:A1990EX30300011
J	Haberyan, KA				Haberyan, Kurt A.			Two Trophic Upsurges With Differing Responses During the Filling of a Mid-Continental Reservoir (Mozingo Studies III)	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												Mozingo Lake was sampled monthly for 4 y following its impoundment in order to further understand trophic upsiirges and to refine the classic model of upsurges. Upsurge 1 occurred in Month 8, when lake area increased by 184% and inundated only floodplain with comparable coverages of forest, cropland, and grassland (30%-33% each). At this time nitrate increased dramatically and was related to both precipitation and lake area increase, likely due to ammonia-based fertilizers from the flooded cropland. Phytoplankiof biovolume remained low, however, likely due to the abundance of Daphnia and other zooplankton grazers. After recovery, the lake expanded dramatically again in Month 21 (Upsurge 2); lake area increased by 36%, but this expansion flooded land with less floodplain (23%) and with different proportions of land use (45% grassland, 31% forest, 14% cropland). Upsurge 2 experienced initial increases in nitrate and zooplankton, but these were minor compared to Upsurge 1, and phytoplankton remained low. These initial responses were followed by substantial increases in phosphate, which related to lake area increase; cyanobacteria biovolume expanded, but zooplankton abundance declined. Therefore the two upsurges were driven by different factors: nitrate in Upsurge 1, but phosphate in Upsurge 2. These drivers, in turn, may reflect differences in the newly-flooded land, including differences in land use and in landscape position (i.e., slope). In addition to seasonal succession, the phytoplankton of Mozingo Lake exhibited longer-term primary succession that related first to nitrate, then to grazing, then to multiple factors, suggesting increases in food web complexity. In contrast to the classic model of upsurges, the biotic responses in Mozingo Lake were quite transitory, and the nature of the upsurges varied with the characteristics of the newly-inundated land. Therefore, it appears that trophic upsurge is more variable than the classic model suggests.																			0003-0031	1938-4238				OCT	2020	184	2					248	267		10.1637/0003-0031-184.2.248	http://dx.doi.org/10.1637/0003-0031-184.2.248													WOS:000585001000009

Of 35 species recorded, only one, Alonella nana, was found to be perennial. The majority of species hatched in May/June, at temperatures of 4-15 degrees C and disappeared in October/November at temperatures of 1-6 degrees C. Males were found in 23 species, and always at the end of the active period. No species were found to have more than one period of gamogenesis. Day activity, which was most intense in the afternoon, seemed to be the common pattern.

Ascherson, has been compared at acidic and eutrophic habitats in the Lake District. The physico-chemical environment (bulk-water and sediment-interstitial-water pH, CO2, O2, nutrient concentrations and PAR) have been related to seasonal photosynthesis (CAM activity, [CO2]i and CO2 and PAR response characteristics) and leaf growth rate of adult plants and ramets. In general, the environment was more favourable for plant growth at Esthwaite Water (the eutrophic site) than at Red Tarn (acidic). Although bulk-water pH was higher at Esthwaite, sediments were deeper and interstitial water CO2 concentrations greater. Concentrations of nitrate and ammonium, phosphorus and potassium were also higher. However, shading by phytoplankton blooms and epiphytes reduced PAR incident on Esthwaite plants. Photosynthetic characteristics and growth of L. uniflora followed the seasonal changes in PAR and temperature. However, Esthwaite L. uniflora showed greater CAM activity, and slightly higher [CO2]i and photosynthetic capacity. Esthwaite plants also possessed more numerous, shorter leaves with greater chlorophyll and nitrogen content, and leaf growth rate and ramet production were greater than for Red Tarn plants. Esthwaite L. uniflora transplanted to Red Tarn showed higher rates of growth than native Esthwaite plants, while Red Tarn L. uniflora transplanted to Esthwaite performed poorly and retained the lower rate of ramet growth found in native Red Tarn plants. End of season productivity was greatest in Esthwaite to Red Tarn transplants and lowest in Red Tarn to Esthwaite transplants. The relationships between environmental conditions and plant performance at the two sites are discussed in the context of the disappearance of L. uniflora from acidic and eutrophic sites in N. Europe in recent years.																			0028-646X					FEB	1992	120	2					289	304		10.1111/j.1469-8137.1992.tb05666.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.1992.tb05666.x													WOS:A1992HE57300014

During the present study, performed between March 2009 and February 2010 at monthly intervals at Lake Sapanca, Turkey, a total of 128 specimens of S. eryththrophthalmus were examined. Of these, 88 (68.8%) were infected by L. pulchella, which totalled 251 in number, with a mean intensity [mean number of parasites per infected fish] of 2.85 and a mean abundance [mean number of parasites calculated over all fish sampled] of 1.96 individuals. There was no distinct seasonality in the occurrence of L. pulchella throughout the study period. The maximum mean abundance of the infection was recorded as 2.84 individuals in July. The prevalence of L. pulchella increased with fish body size. The maximum intensity of the infection was 12 specimens of L. pulchella in July on a single fish. The branchial distribution of L. pulchella was studied and no preference was found in the distribution of the parasite between the gill arches on the left and right side. Gill arches II and III, medial segments, posterior hemibranches, and inner surface of the hemibranches were preferred by L. pulchella.																			0011-216X	1568-5403				MAR	2012	85	3					277	286		10.1163/156854012X624691	http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/156854012X624691													WOS:000304236700003

Samples of water, bottom sediment. whole-body fish, and bird livers for analysis of selenium concentrations were collected before, during, and after irrigation season from streams, canals, lakes, and ground water in each project area. Selenium concentrations in water ranged from less than the detection limit of 1 mug/L in 42% of the 586 samples collected to 4,800 mug/L from a well in the Pine River Area, in southern Colorado. Selenium concentrations in 223 samples of bottom sediment ranged from less than the detection limit of 0.1 mug/g to 85 mug/g in a sample from the Middle Green River Basin, in Utah. Selenium concentrations in whole-body fish (all species) ranged from 0.1 mug to 50 mug per gram dry weight, with the maximum concentration observed in a carp from the Gunnison River Basin, in western Colorado. Selenium concentrations in bird livers (all species) ranged from less than 0.32 mug to 170 Kg per gram dry weight with the maximum concentration observed in the liver of an avocet from the Kendrick Reclamation Project, in Wyoming. Cretaceous-age marine shales probably are the original sources for selenium in 16 of the 20 areas studied. In several areas, evaporative concentration of applied irrigation water and drainage of this water to wetlands, canals, streams, and lakes appears to be responsible for elevated concentrations of selenium.																			0733-9437	1943-4774				MAY-JUN	1993	119	3					522	536		10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9437(1993)119:3(522)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9437(1993)119:3(522)													WOS:A1993LD97000008
J	HART, RC				HART, RC			ZOOPLANKTON DISTRIBUTION IN RELATION TO TURBIDITY AND RELATED ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENTS IN A LARGE SUBTROPICAL RESERVOIR - PATTERNS AND IMPLICATIONS	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. A marked gradient in water transparency along the 75 km longitudinal axis of Lake le Roux, a fjord-like reservoir on the Orange River, South Africa, was consistently evident over several years. On average, Secchi depth transparency doubled from approximately 18 cm at the turbid upper end (which is fed by sediment-laden Orange River water discharged from Lake Verwoerd), to 33 cm near the dam wall. A variety of changes in abiotic limnological attributes (temperature, light attenuation, suspended solids and nutrient levels, etc.), and in the abundance and composition of planktonic biota accompany, and may be imposed by, this turbidity gradient. 2. On average, phytoplankton abundance (assessed as chlorophyll content), and total crustacean zooplankton biomass (per unit volume) were lowest at the very top of the lake, but reached maximal values within 15 km ''downstream'', reflecting the rapid development of plankton. These variables subsequently declined downstream, in contrast to the apparent improvement in conditions for planktonic existence (increasing water transparency, longer water residence time, etc.). 3. The composition of crustacean zooplankton varied along the length of the reservoir. Both seasonal and inter-annual differences were evident. On average, however, cladocerans (Daphnia, Moina), despite their r-selected attributes, were especially sparse in the more turbid, uppermost reaches, where advective effects of river inflows were most pronounced. The large predatory copepod Lovenula was surprisingly most abundant in this region, where potential planktonic crustacean prey was scarce. The attainment of maximal zooplankton standing stocks some 15 km downstream was attributable to the proliferation particularly of the herbivorous copepod Metadiaptomus, along with minor increases in several cladoceran components. The latter continued to increase downstream, in line with declining turbidity, although Daphnia and Moina reached their respective abundance maxima in central and lower reaches of the reservoir, reflecting slight disparities in response to turbidity or related gradients. By contrast, copepod abundance declined progressively downstream, perhaps reflecting longitudinal shifts in competitive balance between copepods and cladocerans. 4. A variety of fundamental issues relevant to the trophic resource base of reservoir zooplankton are raised by and discussed in relation to these observations.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				OCT	1990	24	2					241	263		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1990.tb00706.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1990.tb00706.x													WOS:A1990ED56800003

Lessons Learned: Geographic Information Systems and Farmworkers in the Lake States	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SAFETY AND HEALTH												Agencies serving the estimated 42,000 to 137,000 migrant and seasonal farmworkers in the Lake States (Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota) face distinct challenges, including inadequate access to farmworker data to address their needs. This project developed and evaluated a geographical information system (GIS) database for compiling and displaying existing farmworker data in the Lake States. A three-step study was conducted in the Lake States: (1) a preliminary resource and needs assessment was conducted among agencies serving farmworkers, (2) a GIS product was created using data available from state agencies, and (3) the GIS product was evaluated by an advisory board of qualified occupational health and safety representatives for appropriateness, applications, and ease of use. Agencies participated by sharing their available farmworker data. The GIS product consisted of a CD-ROM with data displayed in a graphic format and downloadable spreadsheet files consolidated by county demographic, crop, housing, and migrant health clinic information. Evaluators of the GIS product found it to be an accessible, unique clearinghouse for farmworker-related data. The GIS product can become a valuable tool for agencies serving farmworkers and those researching farmworker-related issues. Agencies and health professionals require useful and comprehensive databases to track and serve farmworkers, and a multi-agency partnership using GIS technology could provide this capability. Further research is required with improved definitions and resources to apply the GIS product.																			1074-7583	1943-7846				FEB	2005	11	1					85	97	PMID 15782891	10.13031/2013.17899)@2005	http://dx.doi.org/10.13031/2013.17899)@2005								15782891					WOS:000213591300008
J	Xiao, SC; Xiao, HL				Xiao, Shengchun; Xiao, Honglang			Radial growth of Tamarix ramosissima responds to changes in the water regime in an extremely arid region of northwestern China	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY												The response of radial growth of tamarisk (Tamarix ramosissima) growing on the shore of West-Juyan Lake, on the Heihe River in northwestern China, to changes in the lake's water regime was studied using tree-ring chronologies, principal components (PC) analysis, and classical correlation analysis. The first PC accounted for 53.3% of the total variance and reflected a common growth response at different sites. Correlation analysis indicated that fluctuations in the lake's water level during the growing season (May-August) was primarily responsible for variations in the radial growth of tamarisk and explained more of the variance at low-lying sites than at higher sites. The second PC accounted for 30.7% of the total variance and revealed distinct differences in growth response between low-lying sites and those on higher ground. Total annual precipitation played an important role in radial growth of tamarisk at the higher sites. The spatial pattern in the tree-ring chronologies for different sites was performed in the temporal pattern of the tree-ring chronology at the same site. Other factors such as microtopography, soil salinity, sand activity, and browsing by herbivores also affected the radial growth of tamarisk. The diversity in responses to the maximum water table depth for tamarisk in the study area appears to have been caused by local variations in precipitation, which can compensate to some degree for the inability of a plant's roots to reach the water table.																			0943-0105					NOV	2007	53	3					543	551		10.1007/s00254-007-0666-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00254-007-0666-1													WOS:000250464700009

During the study, 847 birds were marked, and the movements of most were followed during the season they were marked. About 40% of the adults and 2% of the nestlings and juveniles were resighted or recaptured in 2 or more years. All recovered nestlings had dispersed from their natal colonies (median distance = 6.37 km). Most breeding adults remained faithful to previously used colonies, as well as to clusters within colonies, nests and mates, when the latter were alive and available. Some individuals did disperse. More females than males dispersed and usually moved farther both within and between breeding seasons. Males and, especially, females that had nested unsuccessfully with a particular mate in a particular location had a higher probability of deserting and dispersing than did successful breeders, both within and between breeding seasons. Old nests were reused at high frequencies for consecutive breeding attempts across breeding seasons. After successful 1st nests, breedings tended to move to secondary nests within 25 m of their first nests.																				1938-4254					1984	101	4					780	789		10.2307/4086904	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/4086904													WOS:A1984TP60200012

It is synthesized by various heterotrophic microorganisms from aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, and, also, is a component of cellulolytic system. GLC can represent a model enzyme for the studding microbial decomposition process of carbohydrates from natural ecosystems. The aim of the present paper is to describe some aspects of GLC spatial and temporal dynamics, investigated in water and sediment of several aquatic ecosystems of Danube Delta, during 2011-2013 interval: Rosu Lake, Mandra Lake and two adjacent channels, Rosu - Imputita Channel and Rosu - Puiu Channel. In the studied period, the highest activity of the GLC was recorded at the water-sediment interface; maximum value (20137 nmol p-nitrophenol g-1 h-1) was reached in October 2013 in Rosu Lake. For seasonal and annual dynamics of GLC activity, the water and sediment samples had shown high similarity tendencies. The ecosystem where the average GLC activity was higher in the research period was Rosu - Impuita Channel. Statistical analysis methods (hierarchical cluster, NMDS and one way ANOVA) were used to evaluate the similarity of data series from different ecosystems and areas.

Our measurements of Cs-137 in water, sediments and pore water in the mono- and meromictic basins of Lake Lugano (Lago di Lugano) reveal generally slower half-removal times of 1.2 and 6.7 yrs, respectively. In the seasonally anoxic southern basin, this is most probably related to an intensive recycling of Cs-137 between water and sediments. In the permanently stratified northern basin the removal rate is much slower due to an important inventory build up in the deep anoxic part of the basin.

J	RAJAN, SD; FRISK, GV				RAJAN, SD; FRISK, GV			SEASONAL-VARIATIONS OF THE SEDIMENT COMPRESSIONAL WAVE-SPEED PROFILE IN THE GULF OF MEXICO	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												The seasonal variation of the sediment compressional wave-speed profile due to temperature variability in the water column is investigated for shallow-water regions, where large temperature fluctuations can occur during the course of a year. For example, in water depths of less than 30 m in the Gulf of Mexico, field observations indicate that the annual fluctuation of the ocean bottom temperature is approximately sinusoidal with a peak-to-trough value of about 15-degrees-C. The heat flow across the water/sediment interface results in the variation of the pore water temperature with season. It is shown that the compressional wave speed varies approximately linearly with pore water temperature, an effect which is, to first order, independent of both the porosity and given sediment type. Further, the velocity ratio (ratio of sound speeds in the water and the sediment at the water/sediment interface) is shown to be independent of temperature but dependent on sediment type. The effect of variations in water column temperature on sediment compressional wave speed is demonstrated by inversions of two data sets. The data were obtained at the same location in the Gulf of Mexico but at different seasons. Finally, the importance of these variations is studied by considering their effect on (a) the prediction of the pressure field in the water column and (b) the errors introduced in source localization by matched-field processing.																			0001-4966					JAN	1992	91	1					127	135		10.1121/1.402760	http://dx.doi.org/10.1121/1.402760													WOS:A1992HE38500014

A Lagrangian approach was used as the sampling method in order to evaluate the relative importance of the major contaminant sources along the River, viz. the Great Lakes, Ottawa River tributaries and industries. PCBs appear to be the major organochlorine contaminant in the River with a mean concentration of ca. 1.00 ng/L. Chlordane is quite important with a mean concentration of 0.32 ng/L. However, hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and hexachlorocyclohexanes (BHCs) have much smaller concentrations, 0.01 and 0.06 ng/L respectively. The situation for PCBs has improved as their concentrations have decreased slightly since the late eighties. BHCs showed a similar trend during the same period. In contrast, HCB and chlordane concentrations have remained relatively constant since 1986. Fluxes of each organochlorine compound in general tend to increase from Cornwall to Quebec. However, differences in behaviour were observed depending on the contaminant. Seasonal trends were also evident. However, in general, the transport of hydrophobic contaminants is closely linked to the fluxes of suspended particulate matter. BHC on the other hand being quite hydrophilic behaves differently. Finally, the relative importance of each source varies according to the contaminant.

Males were unusually longer than females independently from the season or the year. The specimens (both sexes) collected during cold months were longer than those collected during warm months. The body size of A. margalefi was strongly correlated with temperature. A correlation was found also with photoperiod, salinity and (but only for females) with adult sex-ratio and population density. The average body size of 1988-specimens proved statistically different from other years. Specimens collected from the lake were smaller than those from the sea, where in addition they did not show any sex size-dimorphism. These results suggest that the body size of A. margalefi (a species adapted to variable environments) is inversely correlated with favourable conditions for reproduction, and it shows a different variability range in the two sexes probably due to the different cost of gametogenesis in two sexes.

J	Chambers, LA; Bartley, JG; Herczeg, AL				Chambers, LA; Bartley, JG; Herczeg, AL			Hydrogeochemical evidence for surface water recharge to a shallow regional aquifer in northern Victoria, Australia	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The Third, Middle and Reedy Lakes system in northern Victoria is a series of interconnected lakes in which groundwater discharge and recharge occur under seasonal climatic and artificial influences. At high lake levels there is a pronounced mounding effect which tends to cause localised perturbation of flow systems and recharge into the uppermost aquifer. Three hydrostratigraphic units (referred to as 'Lower','Middle' and 'Upper') are identified beneath the lakes. An upward hydraulic gradient exists in the region under the present hydrologic regime. Despite this, hydrochemical and isotopic evidence has demonstrated a fresh water lens beneath Reedy Lake in the Middle and Lower aquifers. These waters have similar characteristics to the present-day water table which is being recharged from the lakes, suggesting that the lens represents lake-water recharge under a prior hydrologic regime when regional water tables were lower. The recognition of this lens has important implications for future management strategies in that it may be possible to implement a more natural wetting-drying cycle without the intrusion of saline water into this ecologically sensitive area.

Gauging one of the subsurface streams showed that, although its discharge is correlated and synchronized with nearby groundwater levels, its hydrograph often reflected that of rain-melt input. According to our calculations, pipe throughflow does not carry more than one fifth of the seasonal rain-melt input. During short periods (hourly basis) however, it may become the main souce of water input to the lake. The water delivered by pipe throughflow forms a distinct 0.5-1 m thick acidic layer (pH: 4.4-4.8) that invades the lake just beneath the lake ice cover and is susceptible to affect the fish spawning ground.																			0022-1694	1879-2707				NOV 15	1987	95	1-2					39	54		10.1016/0022-1694(87)90114-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-1694(87)90114-4													WOS:A1987L156100004

Influence of ontogenetic stages and seasonality on the diet of the longtail knifefishSternopygus macrurus(Gymnotiformes, Sternopygidae) in a large Neotropical river	STUDIES ON NEOTROPICAL FAUNA AND ENVIRONMENT												The longtail knifefishSternopygus macrurusis widely distributed in Neotropical regions, but because of its activity pattern, low recruitment, and ability to hide make it difficult to capture. Records of this species are rarely included in natural history and ecology studies. We studied the influence of both ontogenetic stages and seasonality on the diet ofS. macrurusin the Sao Francisco River, using structure and proprieties trophic webs analysis. A total of 11 items were identified in the diet of 62S. macrurusspecimens: eight in juveniles, 10 in adults, 10 in the dry season, and eight in the rainy season. The trophic webs produced for adults and for the rainy season were more complex, showing a greater number of nodes, links, and link densities in relation to juveniles and for the dry season. However, Decapoda (i.e. freshwater shrimp) was the most important food item regardless of ontogenetic stage or season. This contrasts with previous reports of a predominantly piscivorous diet inS. macrurus. We have identified food plasticity forS. macrurus, suggesting that this species is opportunistic.

The Bay has a maximum depth of 15 m, and surface area of 500 km(2). The bay is suffering from a serious pollution problem caused by the inflow of brackish water from Lake Edku and the poor-quality water discharged from the Rosetta Nile branch. The variations in wind regimes and seasonal fluctuations in the horizontal distributions of water temperature and salinity have largely affected water circulation in the Bay. The present study investigates water circulation in Abu-Qir Bay and its role in pollutants transport, with the use of numerical modeling techniques. Modeled pollutants include toxic metals and hydrocarbons (dissolved and dispersed petroleum hydrocarbons (DDPH)). The flow velocities induced by several combinations of wind and discharge of the Rosetta Nile branch, Lake Edku and Tabia Pump Station (TPS) were calculated at time steps of 30 s for a period of one month per season each year. The observation point (monitoring station) was chosen near the Abu-Qir Harbor. The calibration and sensitivity analysis of the model were carried out with the use of field-measured pollutant concentrations of toxic metals and hydrocarbons (DDPH) and water circulation data for the Abu-Qir Bay.

For 10 years, Batata Lake received tailings (water and clay), generated from bauxite processing. The level of the lake bottom rose, which created periodically flooded areas colonized by stands of wild rice (Oryza glumaepatula) and primary-successional igapo vegetation. Structural factors (water level, presence or absence of tailings, wild rice, and igapo forest) and limnological parameters were related through multivariate analyses. Variables were measured on seasonal and diel cycles at the surface and bottom of the natural and silted areas, in the igapo and limnetic zones. ANOVA was applied to compare coefficients of variation (seasonal and diel cycles) of the variables and differences among areas or zones. Temperature increase, lower levels of dissolved oxygen, greater instability of those factors and the establishment of wild rice stands were related to transparency decrease (clay particles suspension) and clay deposition (shallower depth). The primary-successional igapo forest did not maintain stable habitat conditions. as did the natural igapo.

In order to determine the horticultural characteristics of these mutants, trees of four numbered selections (10-8,10-60,10-97 and 10-98) were propagated on four rootstocks (Swingle, Carrizo, Cleopatra mandarin, and sour orange) and field trials were established at two locations in Florida (Lake and Osceola Counties). Data have been collected over five harvest seasons (1994, 1995, 1996, 2002, 2003) on fruit yield and juice quality (color, soluble solids, and total acidity). Although fruit of each selection ripened during the typical midseason of other pineapple oranges, selections differed in fruit and juice quality characteristics. Three of the selections produced fruit with very few seeds and many fruit had no seeds. The low seed count could make theses selections much more valuable for the midseason fresh fruit market than the 'Pineapple' oranges that are presently available.																			0886-7283						2005	118						1	3																WOS:000243101200001
J	GAEDKE, U				GAEDKE, U			IDENTIFYING ECOSYSTEM PROPERTIES - A CASE-STUDY USING PLANKTON BIOMASS SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Concepts regarding the hierarchical organization of ecosystems postulate the existence of specific properties that emerge at the ecosystem level. As an example, empirically based biomass size distributions of a pelagic ecosystem (Lake Constance) were investigated. The plankton biomass was approximately uniformly distributed over the entire size-range from bacteria (10(-14) g C/cell) to crustaceans (10(-4) g C/individual) on a seasonal average. The continuum of organisms with respect to body size may indicate the existence of a continuum of functional guilds in the planktonic food web, owing to the close relationship between body size and physiological and ecological features of planktonic organisms. It is hypothesized that the internal organization of the pelagic food web (mediated by interspecific competition and successful invasion into "empty" size-ranges) promotes an approximately regular distribution of biomass over the range of functional guilds. This process may be an underlying mechanism for the observed regular size distribution of biomass in pelagic ecosystems. Regarding second-order effects, systematic deviations from the overall rule of a uniform biomass size distribution were observed. The plankton community of Lake Constance was divided into two autotrophic and five heterotrophic groups to analyze potential causes for biomass accumulation in certain size ranges. The allocation of organisms into groups was based on the vulnerability of the algae to grazing, and on the feeding modes (raptorial feeders vs. filter feeders) and prey sizes of the heterotrophs. The overlapping size spectra of the different groups were calculated for different time periods during the season. They revealed that specific properties of component organisms influencing the flow of matter from small to larger sized organisms may cause deviations from a regular size distribution of biomass. For example, algae with a low vulnerability to grazing, and daphniids which feed on a broad range of relatively small prey organisms, both formed modes in the size spectrum. The dominance of size-ranges (almost-equal-to groups of organisms) with respect to biomass changed seasonally. These findings contradict a former conjecture that biomass accumulations in size spectra reflect the action of ecological second-order scaling factors.																			0304-3800	1872-7026				SEP	1992	63	1-4					277	298		10.1016/0304-3800(92)90073-N	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3800(92)90073-N													WOS:A1992JT03200018

The content of triacylglycerols and polar lipids of vendace flesh, varied seasonally, in accordance with the total lipids. Triacylglycerols dominated in vendace flesh, while these and polar lipids occurred in nearly equal proportions in composite plankton. In vendace gut, the share of polar lipids decreased markedly. 3. Plankton and vendace flesh total lipids were composed of the same fatty acids. Their relative amounts varied, especially in polyenoic acids and in the ratio of omega-6 and omega-3 polyenoics. 4.

The Vaal River is ecologically and economically one of the most important rivers in South Africa. In a South African context, the Vaal River, with an average Secchi disk depth (Z(sd)) of 0.41 m and an average euphotic zone depth (Z(eu)) of 1.3 m, is a moderately turbid system. Red light (approx. 670 nm) penetrated Vaal River water to a greater degree than other components of the light spectrum. Water temperature in the Vaal River (min. = 10, max. = 27-degrees-C at midday), closely followed seasonal changes in average atmospheric temperatures. The water-column shows little temperature stratification. The Vaal River is a highly regulated system with relatively high discharge rates at Balkfontein (average 112 m3 s-1), but relatively low current velocity (approx. 0.35 m s-1). Discharge was the most important variable to influence transparency of Vaal River water. Higher discharge resulted in higher total suspended solids (TSS) concentration and higher extinction coefficient (k) values as well as in higher turbidity and thus in lower Z(eu) and Z(sd). From the mean TSS (141 mg l-1) it was calculated that the Vaal River (mean annual run-off of 3532 million m3) transported 498016 tonnes of suspended solids per annum.																			0018-8158					MAR 4	1994	277	1					1	15		10.1007/BF00023982	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00023982													WOS:A1994NB74300001

Future scenarios were developed taking into account the Representatives Concentrations Pathway (RCP) adopted by the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) in its fifth Assessment Report (AR5). To investigate the possible effects of future climate and land use changes on CO(2)emissions, we compared our results with a previous study that simulated the carbon emissions under present climate conditions. The results showed that under moderate climatic changes scenario associated to the recuperation of natural land covers in the watershed (i.e., increase in forestry areas) the CO(2)emissions are estimated to be more than 100% higher than the current emissions in a specific season. On the other hand, in a more extreme climatic changes scenario associated to the expansion of agriculture and pasture areas, the estimates of CO(2)emissions along the year decrease of 5% compared to current emissions. Our findings indicate that the processes such as eutrophication, mixing and stratification of water column and the water retention time will be key elements controlling the CO(2)emission from Amazonian reservoirs in the future. We highlight that the CO(2)emissions from future planed Amazonian hydroelectric reservoirs are uncertain and will be highly dependent of regional climate and LULC changes. Decision makers must to consider these two important factors in the environmental impact studies and comparisons with CO(2)emission from other energy sources.

MANAGING INVASIVE FRESHWATER FISH IN NEW ZEALAND					Workshop on Managing Invasive Freshwater Fish in New Zealand	MAY 10-12, 2001	Hamilton, NEW ZEALAND	Dept Conservat				'Coarse fish' were introduced to New Zealand for angling and ornamental purposes, but their presence may have far-reaching consequences within our water bodies. Through their deleterious impacts on water quality and direct disturbance of submerged plants, large populations of these alien fish have the potential to cause substantial and undesirable changes to lake and river ecosystems. Moreover, the continued influence of coarse fish may prevent the recovery or restoration of such water bodies. In this paper, we review international findings on the incompatibility of coarse fish and submerged vegetation resources that raised an alarm for the New Zealand situation. We also present recent results from NIWA's research programme. Experiments on feeding preference confirm that herbivorous rudd (Scardinius erythropthalmus) present a particular risk to-native submerged plants and may facilitate invasion by less palatable alien weeds. Rudd consumption rates were found to be seasonal and we confirmed a grazing preference for native plants over weed species. Fish exclusion from areas of a shallow eutrophic lake (Hamilton Lake, or Lake Rotoroa) that supports an abundant coarse fishery, was found to substantially increase the early establishment and survival of submerged plants. The complexities of plant-fish relationships and, their outcome for vegetation development and persistence are considered using a simple, illustrative model. Some management issues are considered in the light of research results and NIWA's past experiences with aquatic plant pests. Finally, some future research priorities are suggested.																					0-478-22423-0				2003							59	69																WOS:000227710800008

Levels of organochlorine compounds (OC) especially pesticide residues (lindane, dieldrin, hexachorobenzene and p,p'-DDE), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and polychlorobiphenyls (PCB) were analyzed in organs (muscle, liver, and/or bile) of fishes, collected during 4 years (1997 to 2000) from the Vaccares Lagoon, a brackish waters habitat, in the French National Nature Reserve of Camargue. European eels (Anguilla anguilla), crucian carps (Carassius auratus), catfish - black bullheads (Ictalurus melas) and sanders (Stizostedion luscioperca) were sampled in three coastal locations, in order to compare the geographical and temporal distribution of their contamination by this persistent organic pollutants. The PAH and OC contamination proved to be widespread and very fluctuating whatever the sampling site or the season. They reached in the average, especially for OC, a surprising high level for sample from a protected area largely exceeding, quite frequently, the ppm per dry weight. The large predators (eels and sanders) indeed were the most contaminated. The PCB reached the highest concentration into eels especially in fishes sampled in springtime. The lindane load, which culminated prior to July 1998 when its use was banned in France, has decreased since this-time though it leveled at rates similar to the DDT one's and remains presently still significant. At the opposite, liver and muscle concentrations of dieldrin and HCB have unexpectedly showed a trend to the increase since 1999. The inter-site variations are significant for the whole site sampled regarding the OC contamination. On the contrary, the levels of contamination are quite stable regarding the PCB and PAH what support the hypothesis of an atmospheric transfer to aquatic biotas as well as from water flowing into irrigation canals. The tissular distribution of contaminant showed a shift during the 4 years when our research was carried out. The overall biological load has decreased in the liver and the gall from 1997 to 2000. The naphtalene was the most abundant from 1996 to 1998 but after 1999 their average content in fishes decreases and the concentration of molecules with 3 to 4 benzene cycles (acenaphtylene, phenanthrene, fluoranthene) and the benzo-fluoranthenes prevail. At the opposite the benzo(alpha)pyrene stayed at low concentrations all over our study.																			0249-7395						2003	58	1					77	102																WOS:000182232700002

SEASONAL-CHANGES IN THE PHYTOPLANKTON COMMUNITIES AND THEIR CONTROL BY HYDROLOGY AND NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Phytoplankton community development and water chemistry were studied for 2 years in the lowland R.Bure [Norfolk, England, UK] and most of the Broads (shallow lakes) associated with it. The data were analysed in terms of ''time for development'', which is the minimum estimated time that an average parcel of water takes to reach a site plus that it spends in it before it moves on downstream. This allows to some extent for the delaying effects that the Broads have on downriver water movement. Regressions of mean chlorophyll a on time for development were linear and suggested that the upstream Broads, where phytoplankton first develops in quantity in the system, have retained the water for longer than anticipated from hydrological measurements. They effectively added several weeks to the time for development. Available phosphate and nitrate concentrations decreased with time for development. Those for silicate increased. Seasonal changes in the upper part of the study area were largely in centric diatom species. Pennate diatoms and cyanophytes became predominant in the lower stretches. All major species were present at the extreme upper end of the stretch. With increasing development time, in a water mass dominated by water entering at the head of the study area, a succession of Cyclotella meneghiniana, Stephanodiscus hantzchii and Melosira species was followed by Oscillatoria species than Diatoma elongatum, Synedra ulna and Anabaena planctonica. Possible reasons for these changes are discussed. Over 80 other taxa were present though none were so abundant as the above species. The succession is interpreted in terms of nutrient physiology and algal growth rates to generate hypothesis for experimental testing.																			0142-7873	1464-3774				JUL	1989	11	4					839	867		10.1093/plankt/11.4.839	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/11.4.839													WOS:A1989AD91900013

As a model species, we chose a catadromous eel species, Japanese eelAnguilla japonica, which is transported poleward by the Kuroshio in early life stages. We analyzed a 50-year record ofA. japonicajuvenile (glass eel) catch from an estuary (Lake Hamana, Japan) with regional environmental data, using multiple linear regression with stepwise variable selection. Kuroshio path indicator (fishing-season mean of sea level difference between two tide stations), year, or their interaction showed moderate to strong evidence of an effect on the natural log-transformed catch of glass eels in the regression models. Strong evidence of an interaction effect between the Kuroshio path indicator and year was also found on the natural log-transformed catch-per-unit-effort. The estuarine recruitment ofA. japonicaglass eels was suggested to be positively influenced by nearshore Kuroshio position, but the influence has been lost in recent decades. The present study provides statistically robust evidence of the environment-recruitment relationship (western boundary current-recruitment link) for coastal species. This finding enhances our understanding of coastal recruitment of organisms transported by western boundary currents and is potentially essential in forecasting recruitment for fisheries management and conservation. Furthermore, our findings suggest that stock decline may lead to poorer understanding of environment-recruitment relationship.

The samples were collected on a daily basis in open buckets thus representing bulk samples. Although measurements are referred to as wet deposition samples, they are actually an upper limit for the wet deposition. The rainwater was initially analysed for pH, sulphate and nitrate content, while during the period March 1990 - May 1991 the analyses were extended to major ion concentrations: hydrogen, sulphate, nitrate, chloride, ammonium, sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium. The pH frequency distribution, pH medians and precipitation weighted average (PWA) concentrations of hydrogen, sulphate and nitrate are presented, as well as wet deposition rates of sulphur (as sulphate) and nitrogen (as nitrate). The dependence of hydrogen, sulphate and nitrate mean concentrations on wind directions and seasons for Site 1 is also given. The highest precipitation acidity is obtained at urban and industrial Site 1 (city of Rijeka) because of the local washout of the atmosphere and influence of dry deposition, and at remote Site 4 (Lake Vrana) due to long-range transport. The neutralizing potential of sea salt and soil dust is responsible for partial neutralization of rainwater at other sites. The influence of sea salt on chemical composition of rainwater is observed at all sites. The estimated wet deposition rates of sulphate and nitrate are close to the values reported for Southeast Europe. The wet deposition rate for ammonium ion at Site 1 is almost double comparative regional values.

Turfgrass Nutrition and Irrigation Water Quality	COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS												Turfgrass sites are increasingly irrigated with low-quality water sources, which may complicate nutritional programs by excessive addition of nutrients or problem ions by causing imbalances. Irrigation sources of most concern are nutrient-rich reclaimed water (i.e., reuse water) and those containing high concentrations of soluble salts. Factors contributing to difficulties in fertility programming are (a) increased temporal and geospatial (by soil depth and across the landscape) variability in soil nutrient/ion status; (b) addition of high levels of chemical constituents to the soil-plant system via the irrigation water, irrigation water treatments (i.e., acidification), and soil amendments such as gypsum; (c) salinity leaching programs that also leach soil nutrients; (d) changes in irrigation lake water quality, such as seasonal fluctuations due to rainfall dilution (i.e., dry and rainy seasons), intake locations across the lake surface, or lake depth; (e) attention to environmental and sustainability issues; and (f) on saline sites, achieving fertilization goals are more complex, requiring attention to maintaining root viability, maximizing grass salinity tolerance, and addressing unique nutritional requirements of new halophytic grasses. Addressing these issues requires proactive and frequent soil, water, and tissue testing; appropriate soil tests; and improved means to quantify spatial soil nutrient and salinity status via spatial mapping.																			0010-3624	1532-2416					2012	43	1-2			SI		451	463		10.1080/00103624.2012.641834	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2012.641834													WOS:000301639200047

Escherichia coli (EC) and enterococci bacteria (ENT) were selected as representative FIB to compare the model performance under different flow and weather conditions in the Gwangju Creek in Korea. The results revealed that model accuracy of the forward time centered space (FTCS) scheme is the highest compared to the upstream, Dufort-Frankel, Crank-Nicolson methods and steady state model (QUAL2E) under dry weather conditions. In wet weather conditions, however, the upstream scheme shows the best performance among the five models. The upstream scheme thus represented a potential method for predicting the fate and transport of FIB originating from nonpoint sources during the rainy season. This study demonstrates that prediction results could vary in response to different numerical schemes and that the amount of discrepancy between the observed and predicted results can be quite significant. We expect that this study could be applied to the water quality forecasting system as a real time management in near future.					; Cho, Kyunghwa/AAO-7769-2021; Kim, Joon/AAS-1429-2020	Park, Yongeun/0000-0002-1959-0843; 													1944-3994					JAN	2012	38	1-3					395	403		10.5004/dwt.2012.3595	http://dx.doi.org/10.5004/dwt.2012.3595													WOS:000300911400054

COMPARATIVE STUDY OF ECOLOGICAL CONDITIONS OF FOUR WETLANDS OF PUNJAB USING MACROINVERTEBRATES AS BIOINDICATORS	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL AND PLANT SCIENCES												A baseline study was conducted from November 2006 to October 2007 to investigate the status of aquatic macroinvertebrates as bio-indicators and their ecological linkages to physico-chemical characteristics of four wetland areas of Punjab namely, Balloki Headworks, Qadirabad Headworks, Rasul Headworks and Kalar Kahar Lake. The sampling points were marked on a map using GPS; Garmen 97. The hydrological parameters such as temperature, pH, LDO, salinity and TDS were recorded to get knowledge of the effect of season on the pond ecosystem. Macroinvertebrate sampling from the pelagic water was done using a dip net of mesh size approximately 0.6 mm, dragged in the water for 15 minutes. These were then preserved and identified up to the order level. The results revealed that Balloki area being under the effect of dry season and agricultural stress had more tolerant species. The presence of pollution sensitive ephemeroptera was justified by low TDS and high LDO at Rasul Headworks. The hydrology and fauna of Kalar Kahar Lake was exclusively different from the other sites. In this case pH, TDS, salinity were highest whereas LDO was the lowest. The relative abundance of sensitive to tolerant species was in accordance with the hydrological data.																			1018-7081						2012	22	4					908	914																WOS:000314519100013

Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to assess the sources of the heavy metals contamination and two components were extracted. Analysis of the lake characteristics and point source pollution revealed that the discharge of industrial effluent and coal mining wastewater were the possible sources of these heavy metals contamination. Based on the speciation characteristics of heavy metals in sediments, the method ratio of secondary phase to primary phase (RSP) was applied to evaluate the loadings and the bioavailability of these heavy metals. The RSP evaluation exhibited that Pb, Zn, Fe, Mn and Ni were mainly associated with Fe-Mn oxides besides residual phase, while Cu mainly existed in organic phase and residual phase. In summary, the potential risk posed to the lake caused by the heavy metals was high and descended in the order of Mn > Ni > Zn > Pb > Cu > Fe.

The major land-use/cover changes are the expansion of built-up land, open forest land, aqua ponds/water bodies and wetland. There was increase in built-up land by 0.80%, open forest by 9.39% and water bodies by 1.31%. The surface inflow from rivers/streams accounts 52% of the total inflow into the lake. The annual average sediment input into the lake was estimated as 650,000 metric tonnes. The nutrient (DO, free CO2, chloride, TDS, BOD and phosphate phosphorous, etc.) levels of the lake varied between seasons and sites. High intensity of fertilizer usage in the agricultural fields and practice of fish farming contribute significantly to water quality deterioration in the lake. The highly polluted rivers (Nambul and Nambol) also finally discharge pollutants in the lake. Today, Loktak Lake has been placed on the informal list of threatened Ramsar sites of the world. Only a concerted effort on the part of official agencies, professionals, NGOs and the local communities to comprehend the complexities of this delicately balanced, biologically rich wetland ecosystem, and take appropriate action, can save Loktak Lake from demise.

Revealing the Origin of Solutes in Surface Water Using the Relationship Between Organic and Inorganic Component Concentrations	ENVIRONMENTAL FORENSICS												The ratio of the spatial and temporal distribution of dissolved organic carbon to acid neutralizing capacity in the surface waters of the Lake Baikal Basin was studied. This ratio reflects the geological and geographical conditions of the watershed. In the warm season, the ratio depends on the watershed's size and relief; in the cold season, it depends on the watershed's chemistry. The ratio was used to estimate the contributions of dissolved matter sources, such as subsoil, topsoil, and the atmosphere, to the surface water. A correlation analysis was performed to establish relationships between the sources and solutes.

Technical note: A significance test for data-sparse zones in scatter plots	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Data-sparse zones in scatter plots of hydrological variables can be of interest in various contexts. For example, a well-defined data-sparse zone may indicate inhibition of one variable by another. It is of interest therefore to determine whether data-sparse regions in scatter plots are of sufficient extent to be beyond random chance. We consider the specific situation of data-sparse regions defined by a linear internal boundary within a scatter plot defined over a rectangular region. An Excel VBA macro is provided for carrying out a randomisation-based significance test of the data-sparse region, taking into account both the within-region number of data points and the extent of the region. Example applications are given with respect to a rainfall time series from Israel and also to validation scatter plots from a seasonal forecasting model for lake inflows in New Zealand.					; Vetrova, Varvara/HHZ-5215-2022	Vetrova, Varvara/0000-0001-8538-5584; 													1027-5606						2012	16	4					1255	1257		10.5194/hess-16-1255-2012	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-16-1255-2012													WOS:000304049500014
J	Duff, MC; Amrhein, C; Bradford, G				Duff, MC; Amrhein, C; Bradford, G			Nature of uranium contamination in the agricultural drainage water evaporation ponds of the San Joaquin Valley, California, USA	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE												Evaporation ponds used for agricultural subsurface drainage water disposal in the Tulare Lake Bed (TLB) of the San Joaquin Valley, California, USA, have elevated levels of U. Waterfowl which inhabit and forage the ponds and surrounding areas are threatened by exposure to U. The ponds, which receive irrigation drainage waters and seasonal rain, are subject to wetting and drying periods. The periods result in the accumulation of decaying algae and other organic material in surface sediments. Sediment and waters in the ponds were sampled to determine what factors control U solubility and sediment U concentrations. Data from a 1990 study conducted by Chilcott et al. in 1989 on the TLB ponds were used to help identify what factors may control U solubility. Pond sediment U concentrations decreased abruptly with depth and surface sediment U concentrations were related to dissolved Ca:HCO3 ratios. Pond algal U bioaccumulation was favored in waters with high Ca:HCO3 ratios, which had lower pH values and carbonate alkalinities than waters with low Ca:HCO3 ratios. Ponds with high salinities and high carbonate alkalinities contained the highest aqueous U concentrations relative to other TLB ponds. Sediment total organic carbon (TOC) was correlated with sediment U concentrations, suggesting that U is bound to organic matter. The source of TOC is most likely from algae deposition.																			0008-4271	1918-1841				AUG	1997	77	3					459	467		10.4141/S96-083	http://dx.doi.org/10.4141/S96-083													WOS:A1997YC09500015

Measurements were made of the attenuation and spectral distribution of downwelling and upwelling photosynthetically-available radiation (PAR) in all the principal types of natural waters found in Tasmania. 2. Most lakes in the State are clear and non-turbid, with water itself and the low concentrations of gilvin being the principal determinants of the green underwater light climate. Many others are deeply coloured by dissolved and colloidal organic material (gilvin, gelbstoff) which rapidly attenuates short wavelengths, specifying a shallow, predominantly red euphotic zone. 3. A spectrophotometric measure of colour, the absorption coefficient at 440 nm, is statistically related to measurements on the platinum scale with good precision. 4. Few Tasmanian lakes are turbid but in those that are the underwater light climate is almost identical to that of non-turbid, humic lakes. 5. Reflectance, R, varied with depth but not in the asymptotic way previously encountered. A linear relationship existed between the scattering coefficient, b, and nephelometric turbidity, but not at the approximate 1:1 ratio reported elsewhere. 6. Most Tasmanian lakes are oligotrophic or dystrophic and phytoplankton rarely influenced the underwater light field. 7. Seasonal variation in optical character is not great in natural lakes and their optical properties and light fields can be used typologically. 8. Simple and multiple regression analysis showed that Secchi depth was a poor predictor of euphotic depth but the optical properties and the underwater light field of inaccessible lakes could be reasonably predicted from laboratory measurements made on small water samples, using regressions developed for a wide range of lake types and by reference to the quantaradiometric scans of lakes with comparable optical properties. 9. An optical classification of Tasmanian lakes made by cluster analysis agreed reasonably well with one based on edaphic, vegetational and chemical criteria.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				JUN	1986	16	3					313	335		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1986.tb00974.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1986.tb00974.x													WOS:A1986C915200003

The severity of angular leaf spot was lower (P = 0.05) in farmer mixtures supplemented with 25% or more of resistant lines BAT76 or A285 in three of four seasons than in mixtures without resistant lines. Significant decreases in angular leaf spot severity were also obtained in the new mixtures when measuring both original farmer and new resistant lines. The results suggest that important foliar diseases can be controlled with modern plant breeding products in systems where varietal mixtures predominate through supplementation rather than displacement of existing genetic diversity by new varieties. However, the supplementation strategy is also limited, because its indiscriminate use in managing multiple diseases could lead to severe erosion of local genetic diversity.																			0191-2917					NOV	1992	76	11					1144	1147		10.1094/PD-76-1144	http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PD-76-1144													WOS:A1992JU92800016
J	ROSA, F; BURNS, NM				ROSA, F; BURNS, NM			LAKE ERIE CENTRAL BASIN OXYGEN DEPLETION CHANGES FROM 1929-1980	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The hypolimnetic oxygen depletion rates of the Lake Erie central basin have been reassessed using a new approach. In the past, the central basin rates have been calculated using the available data, excluding some areas based on either temperatures and/or depth definition. The high spatial variability in the data caused uncertainties in the mean value which were sufficiently large to prevent a statistically meaningful interval oxygen depletion rate time-trend analysis. The new approach reduces the effect of spatial variability (80%) on the calculation of the interval oxygen depletion rates and hence permits the identification of a time-trend with more precision, particularly when the data are corrected for the effects of vertical mixing, temperature effects on metabolic rates by using Q10 coefficient, variable hypolimnion thicknesses, and seasonal variability. A linear regression analysis of the final corrected depletion rates with time shows a significant increase in the yearly average hypolimnetic oxygen depletion rate of 0.030 gm.cntdot.m.cntdot.-3mo.cntdot.-1yr.cntdot.-1 between 1929 and 1980. This increase in the rate accounts for a loss of 4 to 5 gm.cntdot.m-3 of oxygen from the central basin hypolimnion since the earliest oxygen records in 1929. This increase may be directly related to an increase in the trophic level of the central basin, since most of the major limnological variables which affect the depletion rate have been accounted for.																			0380-1330						1987	13	4					684	696		10.1016/S0380-1330(87)71683-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(87)71683-9													WOS:A1987M110000022
J	Cheng, FY; Georgakakos, KP				Cheng, Fang-Yi; Georgakakos, Konstantine P.			Wind speed interpolation in the vicinity of the Panama Canal	METEOROLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												A simplified boundary layer (SBL) model formulation is tested against the mesoscale meteorological model MM5 with respect to the 2 km interpolation of hourly surface wind station data for stations in the close vicinity of the Panama Canal. The required short computation time for the real time interpolation of the wind during air pollution incidents involving crossing cargo ships makes the use of simplified wind models an alternative to the full implementation of mesoscale models. The SBL model does take into consideration the land cover of the ground surface, which exhibits substantial variability in the study region. The SBL model produces features of wind speed that are similar to those of the MM5 simulation along the better-observed Canal centreline. The presence of orographic features makes the applicability of the simplified formulation reasonable only near the Canal where the terrain has small undulations. The simulated wind fields show that the dry season (January to April) is more spatially and temporally coherent than the wet season and that it also has higher wind speeds than the wet season. The evening hours have higher wind speeds than the morning hours in both seasons. The simulated wind exhibits higher average wind speeds and higher frequencies of exceeding 5 m s-1 within the Gatun Lake on the Caribbean side of the Isthmus and the entrance/exit of the Canal on the Caribbean and Pacific coasts. These results are useful for the development of effective disaster mitigation strategies for air pollution events in the region.

Artisanal fishers take advantage of this species annual breeding migration from the lower Cross River to the floodplain lakes in Mid-Cross River during the rainy season, and some migrant stocks are not able to spawn. Since there is a lack of information on this species population dynamics in the Mid-Cross area, this study aimed to evaluate the age, growth and mortality to support the development of effective management plans. For this, monthly overnight gill net catches (from 6 to 72mm mesh sizes) were developed between March 2005 and February 2007. Growth parameters were determined using the FiSAT II length-frequency distribution. A total of 1 421 fish were collected during the survey. The asymptotic growth (L infinity) was 80.24cm, growth rate (K) was 0.49/year while the longevity was 6.12years. The annual instantaneous rate of total mortality (Z) was 2.54/year and the natural mortality (M) was 0.88. Fishing mortality (1.66/year) was higher than the biological reference points (F-opt=0.83 and F-limit=1.11) and the exploitation rate (0.66) was higher than the predicted value (E-max=0.64) indicating that C. gariepinus was over exploited in the Mid-Cross River-Floodplain ecosystem. Some recommended immediate management actions are to strengthen the ban of ichthyocide fishing, closure of the floodplain lakes for most of the year, restricted access to the migratory path of the fish during the flood period and vocational training to the fishers. In order to recover and maintain a sustainable harvest, I suggest that a multi-sector stakeholder group should be formed with governmental agents, community leaders, fishers, fisheries scientists and non-governmental organizations. These short and long term measures, if carefully applied, will facilitate recovery of the fishery. Rev. Biol. Trop. 59(4): 1707-1716.

Gill raker length showed no change from 1917 to 1984-1985, but gill raker number became similar in the two species over that period. Between 1917 and 1984-1985, mean gill raker counts decreased from 48.0 to 45.8 in lake herring, but increased from 41.8 to 43.1 in bloaters. The modal count for both species was 43 in 1984-1985. Intermediate gill raker counts were consistent with the hypothesis of hybridization. Bloater abundance increased greatly in the 1980s, but lake herring remained scarce. Under these circumstances, the rare lake herring would be increasingly likely to encounter abundant ripe bloaters during the overlapping spawning seasons of these species, increasing the probability for hybridization. Basic biological differences between the species, such as lower vulnerability of bloaters to commercial harvest, better survival of bloater fry, or greater fecundity of bloaters, may have contributed to the substantially better success of bloaters. Cisco populations are fragil; only the bloater has ever made a strong and sustained recovery after a severe decline. Hybridization with bloaters may impede the recovery the lake herring in Lake Huron.																			0008-4301	1480-3283				JUL	1989	67	7					1679	1685		10.1139/z89-241	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z89-241													WOS:A1989AC47900012

The results indicated that the contents of the elements in the sediments of Poyang Lake were changing with seasons and years. Generally, the content of each element in low-water period was more higher than in high-water period. Compared with the year of 2003, the contents of Cu and Pb at Nan Ji-shan were lower in the year of 2005, while Cai Jia-wan was in the reverse situation. The content of Cu at Yao Gong-du was also lower in the year of 2005, but Pb was higher than in the year of 2003. To some extent, the contents of Cu, Pb, Cr and Zn were higher than the background value of Poyang Lake basin. Except Dawu River, the content of As at other sampling sites was within the background value. From Raohe River to the Raohe River's entry in Poyang Lake, the content of each element trended to decrease gradually. By using microwave-assisted-ICP-AES to determine the trace elements in the sediments of Poyang Lake, it was proved to be a simple and fast, efficient method.																			1000-0593					AUG	2007	27	8					1634	1637																WOS:000249252000045

Sulphate has been analyzed in rain samples collected at three sites in the Serra do Mar. The sites are called Vale do Mogi (heavily polluted), Paranapiacaba (moderately polluted), and Vale do Piloes (less polluted). Gas exchange of reduced sulphur compounds between biosphere and atmosphere has been examined with the aid of ambient air enclosures. The investigated sulphur sources (and sinks) were the estuaries South of Cubatao, a reservoir north of Cubatao, and vegetated soils at Vale do Mogi, Paranapiacaba, and Vale do Piloes. The content of reduced sulphur compounds was determined in surface water samples from lakes, rivers, and estuaries in the area under investigation. We sulphate deposition and ambient SO2 concentrations revealed a similar hierarchy of Vale do Mogi, Paranapiacaba, and Vale do Piloes confirming the assumed pollution levels. In addition all investigated sites showed considerably elevated ambient concentrations of H2S, COS, and CS2 when exposed to industrial emissions. Emissions from biogenic sources are dominant over the Billings reservoir and over the estuaries. Flux measurements showed emissions of DMS and CH3SH from vegetated soils. Deposition or uptake were observed with respect to H2S, COS, and CS2 mainly due to high ambient concentrations of these gases. DMS, COS, and CH3SH were present in most of the water samples analysed. Maximum DMS concentrations have been detected in anoxic freshwater and estuarine water.																			0306-7319	1029-0397					1994	54	4					315	337		10.1080/03067319408034097	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03067319408034097													WOS:A1994NE95600005

Pontoporeia typically attains its maximum abundance in the slope region, suggesting that this region of the lake is the most favorable for amphipod growth and survival. Profundal and slope P. hoyi exhibited little seasonal variation in mean size while shelf-region populations exhibited strong seasonal variation in mean size. Deepwater sculpins, a major predator on profundal populations of P. hoyi, selectively consumed the largest amphipods: mean size consumed was 6-7 mm. The relative sparsity of larger (> 5 mm) P. hoyi in the profundal, slope, and shelf-regions of the lake may arise from intense size-selective fish predation on this size class of amphipods. Gut content studies revealed that profundal P. hoyi populations feed intermittently. Such feeding behavior was subtly different from that previously observed for slope P. hoyi populations: profundal populations feed more continuously but less intensively than slope populations. Regional differences in feeding behavior may be related to differences in food regime and to predation avoidance strategies. Pontoporeia hoyi apparently is capable of inhabiting a broad range of depth regimens by modifying its physiology (reproductive cycles, generation time) and behavior (feeding, mortility) to adjust ot spatial variations in temperature, food level, and predation.					; Evans, Marlene/NQC-4422-2025	Evans, Marlene/0000-0002-8869-1162; 													0380-1330						1990	16	1					27	40		10.1016/S0380-1330(90)71396-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(90)71396-2													WOS:A1990DE25300005

The detector, which utilized the ascorbic acid-molybdate reaction, consisted of a flow-injection system, a post-column reactor, and a u.v.-vis detector. Before HPLC analysis, samples were concentrated and molecular size fractionated with a series of ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis membranes. The SUP composition was found to be a function of season in both Crystal Lake and Walker Branch, as well as a function of stream length for Walker Branch. Seasonal and spatial SUP variations could be explained using contemporary knowledge of nutrient cycling in streams and lakes. A signal, seen in many of the HPLC traces and which eluted with the solvent front, was characterized but not fully identified using several extraction and degradation methods, as a function of sample concentration.																			0043-1354					SEP	1995	29	9					2138	2148		10.1016/0043-1354(94)00329-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(94)00329-6													WOS:A1995RH94500018

Tape peels revealed cyclic, seasonal abundance peaks in organic and inorganic remains, which suggested that the couplets are varves. However, comparison between varve chronology and 22 yr of experimental changes in phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) loading and their influence on the planktonic community confirmed that the most recent varve-year estimates were 5 or 6 yr too old; this was caused by irregular sedimentation and multiple algal blooms resulting from experimental fertilization since 1969, and indistinct laminations that hampered precise couplet identification and separation. Dated horizons determined from biostratigraphic markers were used to generate compatible profiles between 1-cm slices of Lake 227 Cs-137 flux and reference fallout records. Nutrient concentration profiles were less helpful, as increases in carbon, N, and, P were gradual and no distinct horizon was identified as a clear marker of eutrophication. Long-term assessment of the varve chronology using Pb-210 was hindered by experimental additions of Ra-226 to the lake in 1970, although similar sedimentation rates from varve years 1860-1934 suggested that the varve and the deep part of the Pb-210 chronologies were comparable.																			0706-652X					OCT	1994	51	10					2274	2285		10.1139/f94-231	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f94-231													WOS:A1994QK02600016

An ecological causal assessment of tributaries draining the Red River Valley, Manitoba	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Water resources on the Canadian Prairies are at risk due to human settlement, agricultural intensification, and climatic change. The Red River Valley (RRV), Manitoba, Canada, represents a nexus of these cumulative stressors. Here land use change, combined with a recent increase in precipitation and runoff, imperils the protective function of tributaries draining to Lake Winnipeg. A concerted research effort over the past decade has greatly improved availability of data and knowledge about the RRV. However, a full synthesis of these data and information remain lacking. We undertook a review to identify and compare contemporary and historical land use, climatic, hydrologic, and water quality condition within the RRV. Then, using current knowledge of the ecological condition of streams in the RRV and elsewhere, we completed an ecological causal assessment of RRV tributaries to identify linkages and knowledge gaps between anthropogenic drivers and ecological endpoints. We found wastewater to be the candidate cause of ecological effects in RRV streams best supported by empirical evidence. A lack of complete lines of evidence linking agriculture, the greatest diffuse source of nutrient inputs, and ecological effects in RRV tributaries underscored a need for stressor-specific indicators and improved biomonitoring strategies to better detect likely impacts of land use. We also identified a need for research to connect well-known causal elements in the RRV, such as climatic variables and hydrological alteration, to ecological effects. Our findings provide direction for future research and can aid in development of an adaptive management strategy for tributaries of the RRV.

REPRESENTATIVES OF THE GENUS EURYTEMORA GIESBRECHT, 1881 (CALANOIDA, TEMORIDAE) IN AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS OF BELARUS	CRUSTACEANA					Eurytemora International Conference	MAY 13-17, 2019	St Petersburg, RUSSIA					The main biological features of two species of the genus Eurytemora have been studied: the relict E. lacustris (Poppe, 1887) and the alien E. velox (Lilljeborg, 1853), which can be found in natural environments on the territory of the Republic of Belarus. The relict species E. lacustris has been found only in two mesotrophic dimictic lakes belonging to the Baltic Sea basin: Volchin (maximum depth 32.9 m) and Vecheliye (35.9 m). E. velox has now colonized the main rivers of the south of Belarus and their accessory reservoirs belonging to the basins of the Baltic and Black seas. E. lacustris is characterized by an uneven distribution in the water column and location in deep water layers with temperatures below 13 degrees C. Seasonal and daily vertical migrations have been established for E. lacustris. With age, the amplitude of migrations increases, reaching values of more than 10 m of depth for adults. E. velox is recorded in the coastal biotopes of watercourses and shallow water bodies. In the recent two years, the average density of E. lacustris in Lake Vecheliye has been established as about 2000 ind./m(3), while their percentage in the zooplankton was 6%. In Lake Volchin, its density has been 2-5 times lower in the same period, and there this species' percentage in the plankton did not exceed 2%. The density of E. velox varies from 20 to 12 000 ind./m(3), their average density is 1631 ind./m(3), and their percentual share in the zooplankton does not exceed 1%. For E. lacustris, the body length at all stages of development has been determined. It has been established that males have a greater body length in comparison with females, due to the relatively longer male abdomen, which is not typical for other species of freshwater planktonic copepods. In Belarus, E. lacustris is a bicyclic species, whereas E. velox is polycyclic.

J	GETACHEW, T; FERNANDO, CH				GETACHEW, T; FERNANDO, CH			THE FOOD-HABITS OF AN HERBIVOROUS FISH (OREOCHROMIS-NILOTICUS LINN) IN LAKE AWASA, ETHIOPIA	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The natural food of Oreochromis niloticus in Lake Awasa was studied from the stomach contents of 10 fish measuring 18-32 cm (standard length) monthly from August 1984 to April 1986. Chroococcus, Oscillatoria and Botryococcus were found to be important food items in the diet. Animal foods were observed on rare occasions and these were mainly Rotifera. Blue-green algae as a group contribute about 28.1% of the ash free dry weight (AFDW) whereas diatoms and green algae (excluding Botryococcus) make 2.31% and 2.39% of AFDW, respectively. Botryococcus, detritus and other algae comprised 67.2% of AFDW and it was suspected that more than half of this was contributed by Botryococcus. Blue-green algae, which were especially abundant in the diet during the dry season. November-February, are nutritionally most important. Seasonal variation in algal species composition could influence the quality of food ingested by the fish.

In such lakes, net N sedimentation rates were estimated with two independent methods (sediment core analysis and input-output mass balances). They were higher in eutrophic lakes (Mean: 5.1; SD: +/- 1.6 g m-2 yr-1; n = 13) than in oligotrophic lakes (1.6 +/- 1.0 g m-2 yr-1; n = 3), but independent of [DIN]. Gaseous N loss rates to the atmosphere, as calculated from combined N- and P-mass balances from selected lakes, ranged from 0.9 to 37.4 g m-2 yr-1 (n = 10) and were positively correlated with [DIN]. Reduction of NO3- to N2 is assumed to be the main cause for gaseous N losses. A simple one-box mass balance model for [DIN], based on DIN input and rates and kinetics of N removal processes (net sedimentation and gaseous N loss) is proposed, and validated with a data base on [DIN] and DIN input in 19 deep, seasonally stratified lakes of central Europe. The model illustrated that the amount of water loading per unit surface area of a lake (called water discharge height q) is the critical parameter determining mean lake [DIN] relative to mean input [DIN]. Lakes with a q > 50 m yr-1 have average [DIN] similar to the [DIN] of the inflows regardless of their trophic states, because input and outflow exceed lake-internal N removal processes. A high primary production favors DIN removal in lakes with q < 50 m yr-1. It is concluded that measures to decrease primary production, e.g. by means of P removal programs, lead to an increase of [DIN] in lakes.

A replicated study was established in northern Wisconsin in 1990 to determine the effect of overstory density and understory competition on the performance of barefoot and containerized northern red oak seedlings on dry-mesic sites. The relationship between seedling performance and the number of first-order lateral roots on the seedlings was also tested. Seedling performance was evaluated under 3 overstory densities (each 0.3 ha) - a clearcut, 25%, and 50% crown covers in combination with (and without) understory vegetation control with herbicide. Height growth was greater for containerized seedlings than barefoot stock after 2 and 3 growing seasons. After 2 yr seedling growth was greatest in the sprayed clearcut plots, but was only slightly greater than the unsprayed plots under the 25% crown cover (barefoot 25.5 vs 23.8 cm, and containerized 33.0 vs 31.2 cm, respectively). After 3 yr seedling height growth was significantly greater in the unsprayed plots under the 25% crown cover for both the barefoot and containerized seedlings when compared to all other overstory/understory treatment combinations examined in the study. Early performance results suggest that the light shelterwood silvicultural method (ie 25% crown cover) without chemical control of vegetation is preferred for establishing northern red oak on dry-mesic sites, when compared to the more traditional management schemes.																			0003-4312						1993	50	6					543	552		10.1051/forest:19930603	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/forest:19930603													WOS:A1993MT65900003

Histological examination revealed that the spawning season is from July to September, with a peak in August. The shell lengths at first maturity were 25 mm (2 years) and 27 mm (2 or 3 years) for males and females, respectively. Disturbance rings on the shells formed upon transplantation were used to estimate growth, which mainly occurred in May and June. Growth is described by the von Bertalanffy growth equation for both sexes L(t) = 49.71 (1-exp (-0.416 t)), where L(t) is the shell length (mm) at age t (year). The clams in the lagoon had a shorter spawning and growing season, were larger and older at first maturity, and had a more moderate shell length growth rate than clams from southern Japan. Finally, some reproductive and growth-related responses to various habitats were discussed.

J	PREECE, RC				PREECE, RC			RADIOCARBON-DATED MOLLUSCAN SUCCESSIONS FROM THE HOLOCENE OF CENTRAL SPAIN	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												The molluscan successions from thick calcareous sediments exposed in the Rio Henares valley near Baides, central Spain, have been analysed. The main sequence comprises a thick unit of bedded silts, with occasional interbedded gravels and sands. These silts accumulated in a marsh on the river floodplain between 9940 +/- 120 BP and 6210 +/- 85 BP. Pollen spectra from this period are completely dominated by Pinus which reaches frequencies of approximately 80%. The silts have yielded a hygrophilous fauna which includes several taxa which today are scarce or very local. These include Vallonia enniensis (Gredler) and towards the top Vertigo moulinsiana (Dupuy) and V. angustior Jeffreys. This unit is overlain by tufa containing an aquatic community that includes some brackish elements. A date of 5160 +/- 90 BP has been obtained from charcoal from a palaeosol, representing a pause in tufa growth when the surface was invaded by species of dry ground. The tufa is overlain by slope deposits containing re-worked elements from the tufa, mixed with a xerophilous fauna that includes Zebrina detrita (Muller) and Orculella bulgarica (Hesse). The latter species is particularly noteworthy because it is only known as fossils or from dead shells from a few scattered localities in southern Europe, Turkey and Soviet Asia. The comparatively young date of 2640 +/- 70 BP from this sequence suggests that it may well persist in this part of Spain. A further section, immediately south of the others, represents a much drier facies with a higher proportion of xerophiles including Trochoidea geyeri (Soos), Truncatellina callicratis (Scacchi) and in the upper levels Granaria braunii (Rossmassler). Because of the effects of facies, the sections could not be correlated using molluscan biostratigraphy but their relationships have been established by radiocarbon dating charcoal using accelerator mass spectrometry. These are the first detailed molluscan successions of this age to be analysed from the Iberian peninsula. A preliminary study of the modern fauna revealed several taxa that were not recovered from the deposits. Their absence must either be due to the sediments reflecting a different depositional facies or else these species may be recent arrivals to the area. Unlike comparable profiles reported elsewhere in northern Europe, these successions do not reveal the progressive replacement of open-ground communities by those of woodland. Instead open-ground and marsh faunas persisted at this site throughout the Holocene. As this occurs at quite a high elevation (approximately 900 m) in the Spanish meseta, it remains to be seen to what extent it represents the situation generally in Iberia.																			0305-0270	1365-2699				JUL	1991	18	4					409	426		10.2307/2845483	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2845483													WOS:A1991FY86100006
J	Marshall, S; Oglesby, RJ; Maasch, KA; Bates, GT				Marshall, S; Oglesby, RJ; Maasch, KA; Bates, GT			Improving climate model representations of snow hydrology	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE												In this study previous work that led to an improved representation of snow albedo in global climate models is expanded to include regional simulations of snow cover over three distinctly different regions of the United States. We also discuss broadening our work in snow cover parametrization to include representation of the following processes: (i) the 'dirtiness' of snow (due to dust and other particulate loading); (ii) partitioning of energy between melt, evaporation of meltwater, and refreezing within the snow pack; (iii) heat added to a snowpack by rain; and (iv) the vertical temperature profile within a snowpack. In addition, a new parameter, called 'WFLUX', is introduced as a useful glaciological parameter that is based on the net energy available for snowmelt. The snow hydrology formulation of Marshall and Oglesby is implemented into two widely used climate models: a global GCM, the NCAR CCM3/LSM, and a regional climate model, the RegCM2 version of MM4. A suite of new simulations has been made with RegCM2 for three regions of the United States for the 1992-1993 snow season. The regions of interest include the western US/Rocky Mountain region, the region surrounding the Great Lakes and the northeastern United States. Calibration and validation of the new snow hydrology is accomplished by comparison to available ground and satellite based datasets of snowcover, including both mean conditions and year-to-year variability. The goal is not just to improve the simulation of the present-day seasonal cycle (which is reasonably well simulated by many current climate models) but also to improve the predictive capability of models when used to address questions of past climate (especially those involving glaciation) and possible future climatic change.

J	HABERYAN, KA; MHONE, OK				HABERYAN, KA; MHONE, OK			ALGAL COMMUNITIES NEAR CAPE MACLEAR, SOUTHERN LAKE MALAWI, AFRICA	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Algal communities were compared among benthic and net plankton samples from Cape Maclear, Lake Malawi. In the cool mixing season (from May to August), rocks were overgrown by Cladophora or Calothrix, accompanied by the diatoms Rhopalodia, Cymbella, and Navicula. These diatoms, together with Epithemia and Cocconeis, were epiphytic on Cladophora and macrophytes. In sandy areas, the common diatoms were Rhopalodia, Fragilaria, Epithemia, Navicula, Surirella, and Melosira. In all phytoplankton samples, taken with a 10-mu-m mesh net, cyanophyte cells were the most common (70 to 80%), especially those of Oscillatoria. Biomass, however, was dominated by Peridinium from November to April and by Anabaena and Oscillatoria from September to April when the mixolimnion was stratified. Among the chlorophytes, Oedogonium was the most common, especially from May into December when Pleodorina became more common. Diatoms dominated the biomass in the mixing season (May to September): Stephanodiscus in May, followed by Melosira nyassensis and lanceolate Nitzschia species from mid-June through August. For the rest of the year the epilimnion was stratified and these Nitzschia species were virtually the only diatoms present. Benthic and planktonic communities share few taxa: benthic taxa never made up more than 2% of cells in offshore tows. This conclusion contrasts with previous reports, especially regarding Surirella. Consequently, an abundance of benthic taxa in sediment cores may be interpreted as lower lake level if sediment redistribution can be excluded. The seasonality of the planktonic diatoms is compatible with current ecological hypotheses, and therefore increases their value as paleolimnological indicators.																			0018-8158					JUN 21	1991	215	3					175	188		10.1007/BF00764853	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00764853													WOS:A1991FY90900001
J	LYNCH, M				LYNCH, M			ECOLOGICAL GENETICS OF DAPHNIA-PULEX	EVOLUTION												Detailed electrophoretic analyses on 2 D. pulex populations in temporary and permanent environments strongly suggest that this species consists of several reproductively isolated groups with random mating within groups. The genetic structure and dynamics of Daphnia populations are closely linked with the physical environment through its influence on the evolution and operation of the mating system and diapause strategy. Only those clonal groups that frequently produce resting eggs can inhabit a temporary pond. Since successful ephippial production by a particular clonal group appears to occur only after that group has attained a very high density, an ephemeral environment will facilitate the selection of temporally specialized clonal groups. Ephippial production is much less frequent in permanent environments where the overwintering of females is an optional mechanism for the maintenance of clonal groups. Such conditions favor generalist genotypes (those that can survive all seasons), while selecting against highly specialized clones. The temporary pond population observed in this study exhibited a seasonal succession involving the same clonal groups for 3 consecutive years. These clonal groups often differed substantially in their life history parameters, suggesting that they have indeed specialized to different sets of environmental conditions. The permanent lake population was dominated throughout the year by 2 genetically distant but phenotypically similar composite genotypes. Additional observations on the genetic structure of this population are consistent with the hypothesis that, with little interruption by sexual reproduction, long-term selection removes all but a few generalist genotypes from a permanent environment.																			0014-3820	1558-5646					1983	37	2					358	374		10.2307/2408344	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2408344								28568368					WOS:A1983QJ41700013

The catches were made with a Shannon light trap and human bait. The Shannon light trap was installed beside the highway that used, formerly, to lead to the Sete Quedas cataracts and the human bait was used in the urban area. Data about the Culicidae fauna were obtained as to predominant species, seasonal variation, time of highest density and affinity with human host. Forty-one species were identified as belonging to the Anopheles, Aedes, Aedomyia, Coquillettidia, Culex, Mansonia, Psorophora and Uranotaenia genera. With the Shannon light trap 21,280 mosquitoes were caught and with human bait 1,010. In the catches made with the Shannon light trap, Coquillettidia shannoni, Mansonia humeralis, Anopheles trianulatus, Aedes scapularis and Anopheles albitarsis accounted for 82.78% of all mosquitoes taken. In the catches made on human bait the highest densities of these mosquitoes occurred between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m. Aedes scapularis, Mansonia humeralis and Anopheles albitarsis represented 91,21% of all mosquitoes caugth with human bait. The highest densities of Aedes scapularis, on human bait, were found between 8 p.m. and 9 p.m. and those of Mansonia humeralis and Anopheles albitarsis between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m. Among the genera caught with the Shannon ligth trap Coquillettidia shannoni, Mansonia humeralis and Anopheles albitarsis were most frequent in April, Anopheles triannulatus in January and Aedes scapularis in February.																			0034-8910	1518-8787				FEB	1995	29	1					6	14		10.1590/S0034-89101995000100003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S0034-89101995000100003								8525315					WOS:A1995RJ76100003

The reverse was true for Orthopodomyia alba Baker, O. signifera (Coquillett), and Anopheles barberi Coquillett. Aedes hendersoni Cockerell was found in more rotholes and fewer pans than expected. Pairwise species associations revealed two distinct subcommunities. Orthopodomyia alba, O. signifera, and Anopheles barberi were positively associated. Aedes triseriatus was negatively associated with members of the first subcommunity. The distribution of Aedes hendersoni overlapped both subcommunities and showed no significant associations with species from either subcommunity. Overall, the two Aedes species and O. alba experienced greater intra- than interspecific crowding, whereas the reverse was true for O. signifera and Anopheles barberi. Species richness was highest in elevated deep rotholes (.hivin.x = 3.4 species per treehole sample) and lowest in basal beech pans (.hivin.x = 1.0). Occurrences of O. signifera were not independent of season. This species appeared in fewer pre-July censuses than expected. Orthopodomyia alba, formerly considered rare, was the dominant mosquito in collections from deep rotholes and second in total abundance in all holes.																			0013-8746	1938-2901				NOV	1990	83	6					1063	1073		10.1093/aesa/83.6.1063	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aesa/83.6.1063													WOS:A1990EJ78900005

The mild climate of the area confers great potential on this type of water depuration. A first bloom of Chlamydomonas sp. dominated the system during the period of heavy organic contamination. This algal species disappeared without noticeable proliferation of the zooplankton grazer community. A second phase of water depuration was characterized by proliferation of small chlorophytes, mainly of the genera Golenkinia, Chlorella and Scenedesmus. Rotifers and ciliates grazed on this second bloom giving rise to a third one, dominated by a small cyanophyte (0.5-1.5 m) of the genus Synechococcus, when nutrient levels above the thermocline were low (2.5 mg PO43-/l and 1.0 mg NH4+/l). The cyanophyte population was controlled by rotifers, copepods and cladocerans up to the end of the study. Two blooms of photosynthetic bacteria were identified. The first one, occupying the whole water column, coincided in time with Chlamydomonas and an organic-rich phase of the water column. It was dominated by Thiocapsa sp. and Chromatium sp., both of them sulphur red photosynthetic bacteria. The second bloom, of the green photosynthetic bacteria Chlorobium, established at and below the thermocline when H2S concentrations reached 95 mg/l. The detection of all these easily identifiable organisms has proved to be very useful as bioindicators of the water depuration stage in deep lagoons of the area.

The acoustical transects covered an area of 205 km2 in depths ranging from 0.6 to 14 m. Three basic acoustical patterns corresponding to different vegetation structures, or phytoacoustic facies, were recognized. The first facies was associated with tall plants returning echoes near the water surface; the second facies was related to shorter species produciug echoes in the water column well below the water surface, and; the third facies was produced by plants that give rise to a linear series of echoes near lake bottom. The plant beds were subdivided into phytoacoustic units that represent areally definable, two-dimensional entities characterized by a dominant phytoacoustic facies and vegetation cover. Underwater data collected with SCUBA show good agreement between the basic phytoacoustic facies and the three dominant plant species identified in Lake Saint-Pierre: potamogeton (Potamogeton richarsonii Benn.), vallisneria (Vallisneria americana Mich.) and nitella (Nitella sp.).

INTERSPECIFIC DIFFERENCES AND MACROPHYTE-SEDIMENT RELATIONS	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Sediments and macrophytes were collected at 29 stream habitats in the Lower Nelson River system in northern Manitoba. Macrophytes showed significant interspecific differences with respect to tissue concentrations of each of Cd, Cu and Pb, and also interspecific differences with respect to metal contents of the sediments on which respective species were distributed. Differences in occurrence were related to sediment particle size. Cd concentrations in pooled macrophyte communities, and in some individual species, increased during the season, while Cu and Pb showed maxima in mid-June. Belowground parts generally showed greater metal concentrations than shoots, with exceptions in some species. Cd was accumulated to the greatest extent relative to the sediments, Pb the least. No significant interspecific differences in shoot: sediment metal ratios were found, but uptake rates for Cu and Pb were highest in mid-June, during the period of most active growth. Shoot: sediment ratios for all 3 metals increased as sediment concentrations decreased. Metals in filamentous algal mats showed seasonal patterns that differed from those in macrophytes. Plants infected with rust showed higher Cu concentrations than uninfected plants.																			0003-9136					MAY	1992	124	3					337	355																WOS:A1992HV44500006

The largest remaining wild population in Lake Mohave, Arizona-Nevada [USA], has shown no recruitment since the 1950s. Although annual spawning is successful and larvae are seasonally abundant, no juveniles have been collected in recent decades. To evaluate the potential role of food availability in determining fate of larvae, fish and zooplankton samples were taken in 1985 from the reservoir and an adjacent, isolated backwater in which larvae were naturally produced. Food availability and primary dietary constituents were similar in both habitats. Reservoir larvae selected Bosmina spp. (Cladocera) and apparently avoided Copepoda, while larvae from the backwater selected Bosmina, but avoided Rotifera. Larvae from both places showed evidence of selection for certain sizes of zooplankters, but preferred sizes differed between habitats. These differences were neither attributable to larval size nor zooplankton community structure. Nutritional factors such as type, number, or size of available foods do not explain disappearance of larval razorback suckers from Lake Mohave, since larvae survive to far greater ages and size in the backwater. Predation by introduced fishes appears a significant cause of larval mortality.																			0378-1909	1573-5133				JAN	1988	21	1					59	67		10.1007/BF02984443	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02984443													WOS:A1988L748300006

Differential Bioaccumulation of Mercury and Selenium in Stomach Contents and Tissues of Three Colorado, USA, Cutthroat Trout Populations	BULLETIN OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												Total mercury (THg) and selenium (TSe) levels were measured in stomach contents (SC) and twelve tissues of cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii) occurring in three high-elevation lakes of Colorado, USA, inhabiting watersheds absent past and current mining activities. For 32 of 36 tissues, including muscle, mean THg wet weight (ww) concentrations were greater than in the diet (SC) for all sites, indicating biomagnification. Ranges of THg (mu g/kg ww) for SC and stomach tissue (ST) were 1.23-73.54 and 14.55-61.35, respectively. Selenium concentrations in fish muscle were not greater than in the SC indicating a trophic transfer factor < 1.0. However, in several other tissues, mean Se dry weight (dw) levels were greater than in SC for all three lakes. Ranges of TSe for SC and ST were 166-7544 and 797-7523 (mu g/kg dw), respectively. The muscle to egg/ovary ratio for Se averaged 2.30, 4.60, and 2.68 for the three populations. The variability of SC (planktonic vs. benthic) and differential distributions of THg and TSe in SC and organ-tissues generated questions focusing on the seasonal, physiological, and genetic drivers of these organometal(loid)s in subalpine trout.

THE CANARY IN THE COAL MINE: TESTATE AMOEBAE RECORD ANTHROPOGENIC IMPACTS IN SEDIMENTS OF OLIGOTROPHIC LAKE GEORGE, NY, USA	JOURNAL OF FORAMINIFERAL RESEARCH												Lake George (NY) is surrounded by Forever Wild Forest in the Adirondack Park and has a Class AA Special water quality rating, yet lake monitoring has revealed increasing anthropogenic impacts from salt and nutrient loading over the past 30 years. To reconstruct anthropogenic influence on the lake (e.g., salt loading, eutrophication, climate warming), we characterized modern stable isotopes and testate amoeba and diatom assemblages in surface sediments from 33 lake-wide sites and compared their variability to 36 years of water-quality data. Linear regression analyses support testate amoebae as rapid responders and recorders of environmental change because taxa are strongly correlated with percent change of important water quality parameters. Our assessment indicates that: 1) Netzelia gramen is associated with aquatic plants and filamentous algae, making them a valuable aquatic plant/alga indicator, which is supported by the co-occurrence of the diatom Cocconeis spp.; 2) difflugids are generally good indicators of eutrophication, except for Difflugia protaeiformis; and 3) seasonal differences in water quality trends are reflected in the fossil record on decadal time scales. We show that testate amoebae are highly sensitive to small environmental changes in an oligotrophic lake and exhibit established relationships from eutrophic and mesotrophic lakes as well as new, likely oligotrophic-specific correlations. Correlation coefficients of water quality variables and strains within a species also illustrate gradational relationships, suggesting testate amoebae exhibit ecophenotypic plasticity. Diatom and testate amoeba assemblages categorize modern lakebed sites into four subgroups: 1) benthic macrophyte; 2) high nutrient; 3) high alkalinity; and 4) salt loading assemblages.					; Gillikin, David/F-9011-2011	Schuler, Matthew/0000-0002-4258-3000; 													0096-1191					APR	2020	50	2					128	140		10.2113/gsjfr.50.2.128	http://dx.doi.org/10.2113/gsjfr.50.2.128													WOS:000575419100003

During this study, the fish weight (g) and length (mm) of 122 fish were measured. In addition, the distribution of M. heteranchorus and U. pictorum in each lamella of the gills and the distribution of D. spathaceum in the right and left eye lenses were evaluated. Two different algorithms (MARS and CHAID) were examined to evaluate the total fish weight, fish size, sex, season, station and recorded ectoparasites variables in host fish. In the study, MARS algorithm was formed to evaluate the effects ofM. heteranchorus, U. pictorum recorded in the gills, and D. spathaceum recorded in eyes selected as independent variables. To estimate the MARS algorithm, goodness of fit statistics were examined. In order to determine the most suitable for each individual MARS model, different second, third and fourth-degree interactions were tried. In order to determine the most suitable model, it was taken into consideration that the cross -validity coefficient (GCV), square of error squared mean (RMSE) and Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) statistics were the minimum, the determination coefficient (R-2) and Adj R-2 values were maximum. In order to estimate the parasitic distribution of the host fish according to the total weight, the two different MARS (Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines) model R-2 values respectively; 0.973 and 0.989; Adj.

Using the water quality index (WQI) method, this research offers a vivid and overall understanding of the water quality of Lake Bosten. From 2007 to 2017, 14 sites in Lake Bosten were sampled once each month, and 21 parameters were measured to calculate the WQI. The results show that the water quality of Lake Bosten was "good" overall and showed a trend of improvement on an interannual scale. Seasonally, the water quality during the wet season was better than that during the normal water season. Other parameters usually resolved the WQI values in the evaluation, particularly sulfates (SO42-) and chlorides (Cl-), while the easily treated parameters and toxic metals in Lake Bosten were usually at low safety levels. The water level had an energetic effect on the water quality of Lake Bosten by diluting the environmental parameters, and in practice, it affected the concentration of sulfates (SO42-). Our results provide a valuable reference to water management by providing information on the water quality in Lake Bosten.																			1944-3994	1944-3986				APR	2020	182						68	76		10.5004/dwt.2020.25185	http://dx.doi.org/10.5004/dwt.2020.25185													WOS:000545015800007
J	JEHL, JR				JEHL, JR			ABSENCE OF NEST DENSITY EFFECTS IN A GROWING COLONY OF CALIFORNIA GULLS	JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY												Nest density has been considered to affect the success of gull colonies. From 1984-1993 1 studied the California Gull Larus californicus colony at Mono Lake, California, which has increased 30-fold since 1916 and attained nest densities that are among the highest reported for the species. I found that the Upper Critical Density (UCD) approximated 50 nests/100 m2, but even at 77 nests/100 m2 there was no effect on egg size, clutch size, or fledging success. Shorter (6-8 yr) sampling periods, however, would have indicated that either positive or negative effects had occurred. Gulls evidently disperse after the UCD is attained, because concentrations above the UCD did not persist into subsequent breeding seasons. Density effects are sometimes inferred from comparing long-term changes in population size (as an index to density) with various population parameters. The role of nest spacing, however, is best investigated by comparing the performance of birds nesting at different densities in the same year. Because productivity is influenced by factors that act away from as well as within a colony, studies of nest density provide little information on factors affecting population changes. Apparent effects of nest density in two long-term studies of Herring Gulls L. argentatus deserve re-evaluation.																			0908-8857					AUG	1994	25	3					224	230		10.2307/3677079	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3677079													WOS:A1994PD89100009

These water bodies were found to exhibit significant variations in salinity, from fresh water to a-oligohaline, probably for reasons of local geography. Investigation of the phytoplankton communities of these water bodies, over a 12 month period from December 1990 to November 1991, demonstrated clear seasonal fluctuations in the populations of many species. It also placed the water bodies in three discrete groups which reflected mainly variations in salinity but which also suggested that the naturalness of the Open Pits was an important factor in determining these groups.																			0018-8158						1998	362						161	170																WOS:000073970000016

At the same time, strong growth of the bleak Alburnus alburnus, was observed. Research into prey selection over several seasons showed that prey size and density were often a determining factor for capture, e.g., in C. pulchella, D. longispina and C.v. vicinus.

A feeding index was computed by combining the occurrence, numerical and weight percentages of the items identified in the stomach contents. This index showed that M. rume in the river ate principally invertebrates, especially chironomid larvae. In contrast, M.. rume from the man-made lake contained mostly phytoplankton. This difference was statistically significant. In the lake, chironomid larvae and Bacillariophyceae constituted the main source of the diet of young fish. In larger specimens, Chaoborus sp. formed the main part of the diet. No significant temporal variation occurred in the dietary composition.

Fish of this species and their freshly ingested zooplankton prey caught in this lake between April 1994 and May 1995 were analysed for the seasonal pattern of the fatty acid composition of triglycerides (TG) and phospholipids (PL). Zooplankton of Lake Arendsee was characterized by a high level of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in both lipid classes. The relative amount of n-3 PUFAs in TG was fairly constant over a long period (June 1994 to March 1995), while the PL level of n-3 PUFAs was extremely variable. This was mainly caused by the variation of docosahexaenoic acid. The n-6 PUFAs in TG and PL of thr zooplankton were found in lower amounts as compared to those of n-3 PUFAs. The lipid content of vendace in Lake Arendsee varied seasonally with the highest fat content at the end of September prior to spawning. The level of n-3 PUFAs in TG exhibited a seasonal variation in this fish as well. The highest relative amount of n-3 PUFAs was found during the spawning season. This result did not correspond to the level of n-3 PUFAs in zooplankton. The n-3 PUFAs in PL of vendace showed little variation, with the exception of the period from June to September but were lower as compared to the levels observed in zooplankton. During this period, the relative concentrations of docosahexaenoic acid (22:6 n-3) were low. The proportion of n-6 PUFAs in both lipid fractions remained fairly constant. No clear seasonal changes in the relative amount of n-6 PUFAs in both lipid classes could be observed. N-3 PUFAs were preferentially incorporated into ovaries while the testes contained more free fatty acids (FFA) than TG. The relative amount of both arachidonic (20:4 n-6) and eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5 n-3) was greater in the testes than in the ovaries.																			0071-1128		3-510-47052-4				1998	50						143	150																WOS:000078180200014

The usage of individual-oriented model in studies on the role of the matemal effect in the reproductive switch in Cladocera	ZHURNAL OBSHCHEI BIOLOGII												An individual-oriented model of the population of Daphnia longispina, an abundant zooplankton species in lakes and temporary water bodies of the Palaearctic temperate zone, is described. The concept of the model is based on the growth and reproduction potential of an individual and its ability to switch from parthenogenesis to gamogenesis, which is determined by the life conditions of three successive generations. The model was used for testing hypotheses on the role of maternal effect in the population dynamics of Daphnia. Several important conclusions are made, including the verification of the importance of this phenomenon for the seasonal adaptations in crustaceans. The possibility of maternal effect accumulation in a series of successive generations probably increases the tolerance of populations to annual oscillations of environmental factors. The model affirms the role of the maternal effect, along with the interpopulational polimorphism, as a mechanism providing for the stability of biological systems at the species (population) level.					; Kazantseva, Tamara/T-9164-2017; alekseev, victor/C-7086-2014	Alekseev, Victor/0000-0002-1968-2609; Kazantseva, Tamara/0000-0002-4229-4102; 													0044-4596					MAY-JUN	2007	68	3					231	240											17691459					WOS:000247422700008

Mean infrapopulation density and prevalence differed by site, season, and species and size of hosts. Degree of aggregation and abundance and prevalence of gravid worms differed by species of host. Abundance of gravid worms was significantly lower in metapopulations from localities that received power plant effluents. The differences in infrapopulation density, prevalence, and aggregation appeared to be related to predator-prey interactions, which varied with season and local community structure. Differences in abundance of gravid worms, on the other hand, were probably caused by differential suitability of hosts and by local variation in selenium concentration in the water column. Thus, it appears that both biotic and abiotic components of the host community determined the suprapopulation dynamics of B. acheilognathi in Belews Lake.																			0022-3395	1937-2345				OCT	1987	73	5					877	892		10.2307/3282506	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3282506								3656009					WOS:A1987K389800001
J	PIERSMA, T				PIERSMA, T			BREAST MUSCLE ATROPHY AND CONSTRAINTS ON FORAGING DURING THE FLIGHTLESS PERIOD OF WING MOLTING GREAT CRESTED GREBES	ARDEA												Simultaneously wing moulting birds face a large metabolic demand for feather synthesis. To explain the low body and breast muscle masses of Anseriform birds during simultaneous wing moult, two causal explanations, the ''nutritional stress'' and the ''use-disuse'' hypotheses, have been proposed. This paper examines both hypotheses on the basis of data on the changes in body composition, food intake and feeding activity of a non-Anseriform bird during its simultaneous wing moult: Great Crested Grebes on Lake IJsselmeer, The Netherlands. In the wing moulting period, Great Crested Grebes have the lowest body mass of the entire non-breeding season. This is due to a small fat store and a low mass of the breast muscles. In the course of wing moult, fat mass does not change much, but breast muscle mass decreases by 15% just before and/or during the very start of wing moult, with a further 7% reduction in the remaining first half. Leg muscle mass remains much the same (or possibly becomes somewhat smaller). Although the composition of the diet (which mainly consists of Smelt) does not change during moult, the stomach contents indicate that half-way through wing moult Great Crested Grebes have a very low daily food intake. Field observations suggest that this category of grebes spends less time on the feeding areas, and dives less often or less deep. The close correlations between mass and inferred activity of leg and breast muscles of Great Crested Grebes, support the use-disuse hypothesis. The data do not exclude the possibility that the mobilized breast muscle proteins are used for feather synthesis. For a better understanding, studies on the levels of exercise allowing muscles to increase or decrease in size, either or not under additional hormonal or nervous control, are required. The fact that Great Crested Grebes eat little halfway through wing moult is hypothesized to be due to the grebes'' trying to minimize the risk of breaking the exposed and fragile growing flight feathers underwater.

(2) The organic content gradient reflects varying amounts of wave energy arriving on shorelines; it is positively correlated with substratum silt and clay content and with concentrations of P, K, Ca and Mg. (3) The frequencies of occurrence of eleven species varied significantly (P < 0.05) along the gradient. Different species reached maximum frequency at different substratum organic contents. (4) The same species were grown singly at ten different substratum organic contents. Biomass accumulated after one growing season varied significantly (P < 0.05) with substratum organic content of each of eleven species. The physiological response curves of the species along the gradient were similar (P < 0.01). (5) The experiment suggests that the differential distributions of the species along the gradient are not entirely attributable to differential physiological responses.

J	Maixner, B				Maixner, Birgit			*SÆheimr: Just a Settlement by the Sea? Dating, Naming Motivation and Function of an Iron Age Maritime Place Name in Scandinavia	JOURNAL OF MARITIME ARCHAEOLOGY												Derivations of the maritime place name *S AE heimr-'the settlement by the sea'-are known from 54 examples from different parts of Scandinavia. Traditionally, these are thought to describe merely a feature of the terrain that defined a site's location by the sea, a fjord or a lake. Consequently, they have not been the focus of archaeological research. By analysing the sites' topographical, archaeological-historical and onomastic settings, the theory developed in this article is that the derivations of the place name *S AE heimr denote outlying landing sites of central place complexes that were established in the Roman Iron Age and Migration Period. In this respect, the phenomenon fits with and supplements the traditional Scandinavian concept of the Iron Age central place complex, in which stereotypical place names denote specific central functions, in this case maritime activities such as landing, trading, seasonally practised crafts, and defence. Market functions and the long-term exchange of goods, in particular, are collaborated by many sources. Landing and trade seem to have been prominent activities at these sites, which also show a striking coincidence with far-reaching waterways of strategic and commercial significance. In contrast to place names denoting Viking Age and medieval harbours and maritime market places, there is a dearth of corresponding names for the early Iron Age. The place name *S AE heimr and its assumed eastern-Swedish counterpart Satuna might fill this vacuum, and constitute a valuable tool for research and cultural heritage management regarding the identification of landing and trading sites established in the early Iron Age.

Evaluation of DNA damage in haemolymph of freshwater mussels Unio pictorum from Lake Skadar	BIOLOGIA												This study was carried out on mussels Unio pictorum as test organism, in order to identify the possible pollution in Moraca River and Lake Skadar. Lake Skadar, located in a karst area in the outer part of the south-eastern Dinaric Alps, is the largest of the Balkan lakes and has a surface area which fluctuates seasonally from approximately 370 to 600 km(2). The mussels U. pictorum were exposed in cages by 30 individuals on several locations for the period of three weeks. Following the three-week exposure, haemolymph samples were taken from mussels and tested using the Comet assay and micronucleus test. DNA damage on living organisms, made by pressure of pollutans and other stresors were evaluated. In brief, the results of investigation show that DNA damage is certainly present in caged U. pictorum mussels, and that it is caused by pollution in the Moraca River, which affects ecological and toxicological status of Lake Skadar.					; Perovic, Svetlana/AAU-8575-2020; Šrut, Maja/AAZ-7267-2021; Klobucar, Goran/S-5138-2019	Perovic, Svetlana/0000-0001-6655-0193; Klobucar, Goran/0000-0002-0838-4593; Srut, Maja/0000-0002-3120-7843; 													0006-3088	1336-9563				MAR	2020	75	3					431	436		10.2478/s11756-019-00308-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11756-019-00308-w													WOS:000515162000010

SPATIAL STRUCTURE OF ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY OF MICROPLANKTIC CILIATES IN A COASTAL LAGOON	INTERCIENCIA												Ecological processes related to communities and populations occur in a three dimensional space. However, only during the past two decades space has been incorporated explicitly to ecological studies. In this paper we present a synthesis of the study of spatial structures in the distribution of abundance and diversity of planktonic ciliates, using geostatistical methods, in Chautengo coastal lagoon, Mexico. The objectives are 1) to characterize the distribution of abundance and diversity of ciliates at different spatial scales, and 2) to relate the observed spatial patterns and their variability with ecological processes in the lagoon. Distributions of abundance and diversity, calculated with Shannon index, were modeled and mapped using kriging and conditional simulation, during dry and rainy seasons. It has been found that abundance and diversity are spatially structured in patches, at scales ranging from m to km. Presence and characteristics of such spatial structures vary with 1) taxonomic composition of ciliate assemblage, 2) the spatial scale under consideration, and 3) season. Ecological characteristics related to the found spatial patterns are discussed.

A total of 1208 specimens were examined of which 72.1% were females and 27.9% males (female: male ratio = 1 : 0.40); the percentage of males, however, declined in the higher age classes (IV and V). The monthly determined gonadosomatic index indicated that the peak reproduction period of the species is in April and early May. The study covered age classes I-V, with specimens at age II reaching maturity. The total number of eggs per female varied from 8000 to 41 700, the mean number of eggs increasing proportionally with age of the spawner. Egg diameters also increased during the 5-month ripening period from December to April.

J	Salencon, MJ				Salencon, MJ			Study of the thermal dynamics of two dammed lakes (Pareloup and Rochebut, France), using the EOLE model	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												EOLE is a hydrodynamic thermal model (one-dimensional vertical model) which simulates the evolution of the seasonal thermal stratification of a reservoir. It is a model based on representation of individual physical mechanisms, which takes into account the bathymetry of the reservoir, surface energy exchanges, and throughflow in the reservoir (rivers, pumping, turbining, residual stream flow, etc.). EOLE was applied to two reservoirs with extremely different characteristics: Pareloup Lake, a hydroelectric reservoir with a long residence time (1 year), and Rochebut, a reservoir, with a short residence time (1 month). The good agreement between the calculated and measured thermal profiles in both cases indicates that the model enables very good reproduction of the thermal stratification in each reservoir, the vertical dynamics of water masses, the thermal regime of water restituted downstream, and year-to-year fluctuations over extended periods (12 consecutive 1 year cycles for Pareloup). The model was applied using the same set of coefficients in both studies, demonstrating that the predominant hydrodynamic phenomena in both reservoirs are well taken into account, providing the input data are sufficiently representative of the site under study. The precision of the results obtained and the relative simplicity of the EOLE representation have enabled us to use the model as a basic structure for modeling of an ecosystem.

J	Slipke, JW; Duffy, WG				Slipke, JW; Duffy, WG			Food habits of walleye in Shadehill Reservoir, South Dakota	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Tile growth rate of walleye (Stizostedion vitreum) in Shadehill Reservoir; a 1,900-ha impoundment in Northwestern South Dakota, is much slower than the statewide average. We investigated the food habits of walleye in Shadehill Reservoir from 1994 to 1995 to determine if the dow growth is prey-related. Walleye were collected at night using electrofishing equipment and experimental gill nets. Of the 201 stomachs examined, 114 contained food. We calculated the relative importance (RI) index to evaluate the contribution of each prey item to the diet. Due to a relatively small sample size and inherent gear biases, data from all seasons were combined and analyzed by length group. The RI analysis indicated that Daphnia spp. was the most important prey for sub-stock length (<25 cm total length) walleye. White bass (Morone chrysops) became increasingly important for longer walleye and was the most important prey for quality- to preferred-length walleyes (38-50 cm TL). Aquatic dipteran larvae were the second most important prey in the diets of quality- to preferred-length walleye, which may indicate limited prey fishes for walleye in Shadehill Reservoir.																			0270-5060					MAR	1997	12	1					11	17		10.1080/02705060.1997.9663504	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1997.9663504													WOS:A1997WM93200002

Monthly samples at three stations integrated from 0 to 50 m and stratified samples at the site of maximum depth, were taken during the growing season. Transparency was always controlled by glacial silt, and not by phytoplankton. Lake water belongs to the calcium-bicarbonate type, with low conductivity (24 mu S cm(-1)), and poor buffering capacity. Forty-five phytoplankton taxa were found. Mean phytoplankton density was 49 cells ml(-1) and mean biomass 69 mu g l(-1) N:P relationships, inorganic nitrogen exhaustion in the photic layer, and correlations between nutrients and phytoplankton density suggests nitrogen as the main limiting factor. Fifteen zooplankton species were found. Mean zooplankton density was 12.2 ind. l(-1) and mean biomass 22.9 mu g l(-1). Diatoms and Boeckellidae were the dominant planktonic groups. Morphometry and hydrological factors were responsible for horizontal heterogeneity in phytoplankton and chemical variables.																			0018-8158					DEC 1	1995	316	1					63	73		10.1007/BF00019376	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00019376													WOS:A1995TU89800005
J	Sternbeck, J				Sternbeck, John			Manganese Cycling in a Eutrophic Lake - Rates and Pathways	AQUATIC GEOCHEMISTRY												The redox processes regulating transport of Mn in the water colunm of a eutrophic, dimictic lake (Lake Norrviken, Sweden) are interpreted based on a one-dimensional diffusion-reaction model for Mn(II). It is found that rates and rate constants for oxidation and reduction vary greatly with depth and also with time during the season of stratification. Calculated rates show that Mn(II) oxidation and reduction generally occur in narrow depth intervals (25-50 cm). This is in good agreement with measured profiles of particulate Mn (MnOx). Maximum oxidation rate constants (assuming first order kinetics) at each date are in the first half of the season < 1 d(-1), but then increases to a rather constant value of about 25 d(-1). These high rate constants are indicative of microbiological involvement in the Mn(II) oxidation. This is further evidenced by SEM-EDS analysis showing Mn enriched particles morphologically similar to Metallogenium. Reductive dissolution of Mn oxides occurs mainly in the zone just below the zone of maximum oxidation rate. The release of Mn(II) is accompanied by production of alkalinity and Sigma CO2. The relation between production rates of Mn(II) and alkalinity indicates that Mn oxides act as terminal electron acceptors in the bacterially mediated oxidation of organic matter. However, the Delta Mn2+/Delta Sigma CO2 ratio is significantly lower than what is expected from this process. It is suggested that the Mn reduction is coupled to fermentation. Close coexistence of Mn reduction and oxidation at high rates, such as found in the water column of this lake, facilitates rapid and continuous regeneration of reducible Mn oxides. This gives rise to a quantitatively important mechanism of organic matter oxidation in the water column.																			1380-6165	1573-1421				DEC	1995	1	4					399	426																WOS:000209213700004

The pellets contained chiefly small rodents, fish, eggs and young of geese and gulls, isopods, berries and grass, and blue mussels. The relative importance of these foods varied among the colonies, both within and between seasons. Predation on young waterfowl was more extensive than predation on eggs. The data show that glaucous gulls are adaptable and opportunistic feeders and that the diversity of foods consumed was high and did not vary within the season.

The meiofauna and freshwater nematode abundance pattern and diversity were analysed with regard to water-level fluctuations and seasonal temperature changes. Meiofauna abundance and diversity showed temporal variations. The nematode relative abundance varied from 4% up to 90% of total meiofauna abundance, although totally absent in August. In total, 26 nematode species were recorded. The composition of nematode species depends on water-level fluctuation. Water levels above 200 cm drasticaly changed the composition of species. Brevitobrilus stefanskii, Tobrilus gracilis and Mononchus aquaticus chewers were the dominant species during the low and the middle water level, and suction feeders were dominant during the high water-level. Temperature and water-level fluctuations determined the diversity and abundance of the benthic fauna in the submerged eulittoral zone of Lake Sakadas.																			1217-8837						2001	47	4					269	284																WOS:000175683200001

J	Meixner, T; Shaw, JR; Bales, RC				Meixner, T; Shaw, JR; Bales, RC			Temporal and spatial variability of cation and silica export in an alpine watershed, Emerald Lake, California	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												A reaction set of possible mineral weathering reactions is proposed to explain observed cation and silica export for the Emerald Lake watershed, a small Sierra Nevada, California catchment. The reaction set was calculated through a stoichiometric mole-balance method, using a multiyear record of stream flow and snowpack chemical analyses and site-specific mineral compositions. Reaction-set calculations were intended to explore how the processes controlling stream cation and silica export depend on differing bedrock mineralogy across the catchment as snowmelt and runoff patterns change over the year. Different regions within the watershed can be differentiated by lake inflow subdrainages, each exhibiting different stream-flow chemistry and calculated weathering stoichiometry, indicating that different silica and cation generation processes are dominant in wet steep portions of the catchment. Short-term differences in stream concentrations were assumed to reflect ion exchange equilibria and rapid biological processes, whereas long-term persistent stream concentration differences in different areas of the catchment were assumed to reflect spatial variability in mineral weathering stoichiometry. Mineralogical analyses of rock samples from the watershed provided site-specific chemical compositions of major mineral species for reaction calculations. Reaction sets were evaluated by linear regression of calculated versus observed differences between snowmelt and stream-flow chemistry and by a combined measure. Initially, single weathering reactions were balanced and evaluated to determine the reactions that best explained observed stream chemical export. Next, reactions were combined, using mineral compositions from different rock types to estimate the dependence of ion fluxes on lithology. The seasonal variability of major solute calculated fluxes is low, approximately one order of magnitude, relative to the observed three orders of magnitude variability in basin discharge. Reaction sets using basin-averaged lithology and Aplite lithologies gave superior explanations of stream chemical composition. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

Obtaining the annual sum of carbon dioxide exchange requires imputation of data gaps with high precision and accuracy. This study used five methods to fill the gaps in carbon flux data and estimate the total annual carbon dioxide exchange of the Tugai forest in the arid desert ecosystem of Ebinur Lake Basin, Northwest China. The Monte Carlo method was used to estimate the random error and bias caused by gap filling. The results revealed that (1) there was a seasonal difference in the friction velocity threshold of nighttime flux, with values in the growing season and non-growing season of 0.12 and 0.10 m/s, respectively; (2) the five gap-filling methods explained 77-84% of the data variability in the fluxes, and the random errors estimated by these methods were characterized by non-normality and leptokurtic heavy tail features, following the Laplacian (or double-exponential) distribution; (3) estimates of the annual sum of carbon dioxide exchange using the five methods at the study site in 2015 ranged from -178.25 to -155.21 g C m(-2) year(-1), indicating that the Tugai forest in the Ebinur Lake Basin is a net carbon sink. The standard deviation of the total annual carbon dioxide exchange sums estimated by the five different methods ranged from 3.15 to 19.08 g C m(-2) year(-1), with bias errors ranging from -13.69 to 14.05 g C m(-2) year(-1). This study provides a theoretical basis for the carbon dioxide exchange and carbon source/sink assessment of the Tugai forest in an arid desert ecosystem. In order to explore the functioning of the Tugai forest at this site, a greater understanding of the underlying ecological mechanisms is necessary.					; Wang, Jingzhe/Q-4555-2019	Teng, Dexiong/0000-0001-8742-230X; Wang, Jinlong/0000-0002-0296-7448; Wang, Jingzhe/0000-0001-8332-7997													2167-8359					FEB 10	2020	8								e8530	10.7717/peerj.8530	http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.8530								32095356					WOS:000512759600014
J	Vivier, L; Cyrus, DP				Vivier, L; Cyrus, DP			The zoobenthic fauna of the Nhlabane coastal lake system, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, 20 years after construction of a barrage	WATER SA												The zoobenthos of the Nhlabane coastal lake system in northern KwaZulu-Natal was sampled quarterly during 1992 in order to study the zoobenthic fauna of the Nhlabane lake and estuary. The ecology of the system was changed in 1977 when a barrage was constructed across the upper end of the estuary. Physico-chemical parameters revealed that the previously escuarine southern basin of the lake had become completely fresh. The estuary remained closed during the study period due to a drought, the presence of the barrage and water abstraction from the lake. Benthic composition of the lake was typical of a shallow subtropical coastal lake, comprising a dominant estuarine associated crustacean component and a typical freshwater component characterised by oligochaetes, insect larvae and molluscs. Benthic densities varied with sediment type: with highest densities in detrital mud. The benthic composition of the estuary, dominated by estuarine amphipods and polychaetes, differed from that of the lake. There was a marked seasonal change in the benthic community in response to the low salinities in the estuary. Benthic species richness in the estuary was low relative to other estuaries, with a distinct dominance of a few numerically important taxa, indicating an unstable benthic community. Reduced freshwater discharge due to the barrage and the drought was the cause of the estuary mouth remaining closed throughout the study period.																			0378-4738					OCT	1999	25	4					533	542																WOS:000083534900017
J	SMITH, RMH				SMITH, RMH			SEDIMENTATION AND PALEOENVIRONMENTS OF LATE CRETACEOUS CRATER-LAKE DEPOSITS IN BUSHMANLAND, SOUTH-AFRICA	SEDIMENTOLOGY												A large diameter borehole core from an epiclastic kimberlite remnant on the farm Stompoor in the Prieska district, Cape Province, contains a continuous 76 m section of fossiliferous sediments interpreted as having accumulated within a crater-lake during the Lake Cretaceous. Three distinct facies associations reflect depositional processes that prevailed in offshore areas of the original lake. Facies Association A: matrix-supported pebble conglomerates comprising a chaotic assemblage of pyroclastic, basement and country rocks set in a fine-grained matrix. Flat, non-erosional basal surfaces with ''frozen'' rip-up clasts, the protrusion of matrix-supported clasts above the upper surfaces and a direct relationship between maximum clast size and bed thickness suggest deposition from debris flows that originated subaerially on pyroclastic talus cones surrounding the crater. Facies Association B: alternating thin beds of matrix-supported granule conglomerate, structureless fine-grained sandstone and parallel laminated mudrock. Small fining-upward sequences within these beds are compared to turbidite Bouma Tade, Tde. Numerous partings display petrified fish and frog skeletons, as well as bivalve, gastropod and ostracode shells, leaf impressions, insect wings and a possible bird bone. These beds were deposited by thin debris-flows and turbidity underflows interspersed with periods of ''pelagic'' sedimentation. Facies Association C: microlaminated mudstone beds containing scattered ''dropstone lapilli''. The lamination is imparted by alternating Ca-rich/Ca-poor layers which may reflect climatic seasonality. They are interpreted as the result of seasonally influenced suspension settling through a thermally stratified water column. Short-term periodicities in conglomerate bed thicknesses are interpreted as the result of successive block caving of a slump scar giving rise to several debris flows from the same source area. Seismic shock from nearby volcanism may have simultaneously triggered slumps on both subaerial and subaqueous slopes. Dropstone lapilli in Type C beds and the preponderance of load casting in Type B beds support this interpretation. An estimate of the time span involved in accumulating 76 m of crater lake sediments based on the possible seasonal imprint of Type C beds gives a figure of some 220,000 yr.

J	PERRY, CT				PERRY, CT			FRESH-WATER TUFA STROMATOLITES IN THE BASAL PURBECK FORMATION (UPPER JURASSIC), ISLE-OF-PORTLAND, DORSET	GEOLOGICAL JOURNAL												Recent interpretations of the tufaceous limestones from within the 'Caps Beds' on the Isle of Portland have suggested a depositional environment of intertidal flats and lagoons with typically higher than normal marine salinity levels, a stark contrast with earlier ideas of a freshwater origin. However, evidence is presented in this paper to show that these deposits are indeed most likely to be freshwater in origin. The micro-fabrics observed are typical of those seen in freshwater tufas forming at the present day, and contrast with those observed within intertidal/subtidal stromatolites. Furthermore, the Portland deposits lack syndepositional evaporite deposits, they lack recognizable intertidal deposits, and any lagoonal sediments observed are depositionally distinct from the tufas. Finally, the soil horizons observed are clear evidence of periodic subaerial exposure and isolation from marine influences. Four facies types are identified on Portland: (1) tufaceous limestone; (2) littoral grainstones; (3) subaerial stromatolites; and (4) paleosols. Each facies is repeated a number of times through the sequence, and evidence is presented to show that these formed in a marginal marine setting as a response to a series of minor transgressive (soils to freshwater lakes/lagoon to saline marine/lagoonal) and regressive events (saline marine/lagoonal to soils). The tufa stromatolite deposits themselves, which are often developed around cylindrical holes (representing former tree trunks and branches), are shown to have developed seasonally, by the precipitation of carbonate, due to microbial activity within the freshwater lake environment. Precipitation appears to have been most intense around tree bases (and any associated vegetation), where an active biofilm developed on the underlying soil substrate. Two distinct textures are recognized in this material: (1) micro-porous and (2) macro-porous. These developed together in a crudely laminated, semi-concentric pattern around the holes and together may represent a seasons growth of tufa.																			0072-1050					JUN	1994	29	2					119	135																WOS:A1994NU75700002
J	DAVID, PG				DAVID, PG			WADING BIRD NESTING AT LAKE OKEECHOBEE, FLORIDA - AN HISTORIC PERSPECTIVE	COLONIAL WATERBIRDS												Numbers of wading birds nesting at Lake Okeechobee were documented by aerial surveys during 20 breeding seasons between 1957 and 1988. Wading bird use of the lake for nesting declined noticeably during the period, especially as lake depths increased with the higher lake regulation schedule (15.5 ft. msl to 17.5 ft. msl) beginning in 1978. Higher lake levels reduce wading bird access to critical foraging habitat in the littoral zone emergent marsh, and have been the primary factor contributing to a decline in the condition of large willow (Salix caroliniana) communities that historically contained the major breeding colonies. Nesting at the King's Bar colony, which contained nearly 10,000 nests in 1974 and 6,000 nests in 1978 (excluding Cattle Egret [Bubulcus ibis]), had all but ceased by 1988. This site accounted for the greatest proportion of overall nesting decline at the lake. As the King's Bar site was declining during the 1980s, wading birds dispersed into numerous smaller colonies, many of which were located closer to the lake perimeter.																			0738-6028						1994	17	1					69	77		10.2307/1521383	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1521383													WOS:A1994NT52400009

Eighty-nine net and water samples were collected fortnightly during the period 22 May 1990 and 5 May 1991 from five stations (I, III, V, VA, VI) in different parts of the bay. As the water quality changes gradually from the innermost part of the bay towards the open sea, each station represents different environmental conditions. Altogether 51 silica-scaled flagellate taxa were identified, of which nine were new to Finland. The 51 taxa belonged to the genera Mallomonas (24 taxa), Synura (4), Chrysosphaerella (3), Spiniferomonas (7), Paraphysomonas (12) and Polylepidomonas (1). In addition, three types of Mallomonas scales, not identified with certainty, and two types of loose Paraphysomonas scales were found. Environmental parameters measured were water temperature, pH and salinity. The ecology of silica-scale bearing flagellates in the hydrographically complicated brackish water Pojo Bay is discussed. Notice is also taken of the reliable determination of scaled chrysophytes and synurophytes by means of light microscopy.																			0003-3847						1994	31	1					1	27																WOS:A1994NN20700001

An important source of P for Lake Okeechobee is runoff of soluble P fertilizer applied to bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum Flugge) pastures. The present study was conducted to ascertain whether P application levels could be reduced below current agronomic recommendations without affecting pasture yields or quality and to determine the effects of P application on surface water quality. A field study was conducted on a bahiagrass pasture to assess the yield response of bahiagrass to five annual rates of P (0, 6, 12, 24 and 48 kg ha(-1)) and two application times (dry season and wet season). Fertilizer treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block design with four replications on an Immokalee fine sand (sandy, siliceous, hyperthermic Arenic Haplaquods). Results indicate that P fertilization rates could be reduced from 48 to 24 kg P ha(-1) without affecting yields or quality of bahiagrass. Yields in 1989 averaged 11.4, 14.7 and 10.4 Mg ha(-1) for the 48, 24 and 0 kg P ha(-1) treatments, respectively. Time of P application had no effect on yields or quality of bahiagrass. There was a linear increase in Mehlich I extractable P in the A and E horizons and a quadratic increase to P in the Bh horizon in 1989. Extractable P ranged from 3.8 to 22.5, 1.3 to 2.5, and 21 to 55 mg P kg(-1) for the A, E and Bh horizons, respectively. Phosphorus concentrations in surface water runoff was reduced from 33 to 60% as P application rates were decreased from 48 to 12 kg P ha(-1) while total P loss was reduced from 17 to 78%, respectively. Recommended reductions in P application should result in substantial cost savings to producers and also reduce P inputs into surface water.																			0925-8574	1872-6992				NOV	1995	5	2-3					247	259		10.1016/0925-8574(95)00026-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0925-8574(95)00026-7													WOS:A1995TU39600007

In Lake Creteil, a shallow temperate sand-pit lake. there is a seasonal morphological variation of the setae: the plumose forms were restricted to the warmer season and the spinose ones to colder periods. Contrary to other years, the specific 'spine formula' of the swimming legs (3-4-4-4) did not vary during the reference year. In laboratory experiments, both sex and post-embryonic developmental temperatures had an effect on the length of adults. A significant parental effect on body length was detected. Pairs with anomalous spine formulae produced offspring either with anomalous spine formulae or typical 3-4-4-4 formulae. No significant effects of parental culture temperatures, offspring culture temperatures and sex on the total number of spines were found. Modification of plumose into spinose setae did not occur. whatever the offspring developmental temperatures. The results presented here suggest that the alterations of the appendages of the cyclopid A.robustus could be compared to the cyclomorphosis in other zooplanktonic groups, and contribute to our understanding of the role of phenotypic induction in aquatic biology.																			0142-7873	1464-3774				JUN	1996	18	6					907	922		10.1093/plankt/18.6.907	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/18.6.907													WOS:A1996UU79900004

The mosquito Aedes vigilax was the most abundant species in salt marshes at Mogo State Forest-Batemans Bay, whereas the freshwater species Anopheles annulipes s.l. and Coquillettidia linealis were most abundant at Termeil State Forest. Major faunal differences between the two environments reflected the extensive saline marsh and mudflat estuarine habitats at Batemans Bay and the predominantly freshwater stream, marsh, and lake habitats of Termeil State Forest. A total of 218 virus isolates was recovered from the mosquitoes, comprising Ross River virus (86 isolates), Gan Gan virus (123 isolates), Termeil virus (2 isolates), and 7 unidentified viruses. The period of greatest arbovirus activity was from midsummer through midautumn and coincided with the overall peak activity of the most common mosquito species. Ae. vigilax yielded most isolates of Ross River and Gan Gan viruses and appeared to be the vector of greatest public health concern.																			0022-2585					NOV	1991	28	6					796	804		10.1093/jmedent/28.6.796	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmedent/28.6.796								1685192					WOS:A1991GQ59500008

There was a uniform distribution of sulfur across the filter, but Fe, and to a lesser extent, Mn, was localized in approximately 5-mum-diameter clusters. Elemental analysis with 1-mum-diameter beams revealed that the Fe clusters were mainly comprised of iron oxides. Iron sulfide material not in the Fe clusters had stoichiometric proportions of Fe1.0S060P0.60Ca0.24K0.14. Although a purely biogenic origin for P, Ca, and K cannot be ruled out, the composition is consistent with the particles originating as authigenic iron oxides which react with sulfide as they sink through the water column. The iron sulfide particles are richer in Cu (4,000 ppm) and Zn (6,000 ppm) than the iron oxides, suggesting that these elements are also concentrated as their insoluble sulfides. The coexistence of iron oxides and sulfides indicates that either the supply of sulfide is limiting or that some iron oxide particles are unreactive.					; Davison, William/A-4901-2009	Grime, Geoffrey/0000-0002-4957-8175; 													0024-3590					DEC	1992	37	8					1770	1777		10.4319/lo.1992.37.8.1770	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1992.37.8.1770													WOS:A1992KR73700015

Evidence for a cause and effect relationship was provided by exclosure-enclosure experiments. When grazers were excluded epiphyte biomass did not decline as it did in the lake. Addition of grazers to a dense epiphyte cover resulted in a decline qualitatively and quantitatively similar to that in the lake. Grazing pressure, calculated from general empirical equations for aquatic deposit feeders, was of the required order of magnitude to explain the decline in epiphyte biomass. Because similar seasonal epiphyte cycles have been described elsewhere, these findings should have a wider relevance.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1983	28	1					124	132		10.4319/lo.1983.28.1.0124	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1983.28.1.0124													WOS:A1983QA80900012

Ciliate abundance has been used as bioindicators of organic pollution in a freshwater system. This study was conducted to determine the spatio-temporal variation of ciliate abundance in Lake Lanao, Philippines, along Wato-Balindong's littoral and pelagic zones during dry (May 2018) and wet (August 2018) seasons. It intended to assess the trophic state of the lake based on planktonic ciliate abundance. In each zone, three sites were sampled for ciliates using a conical plankton net. The ciliates were fixed with formalin-acidified logul's Iodine for microscopic observation and counting. Spatially, the data on ciliate abundance did not vary between littoral and pelagic zones. However, it did vary significantly between seasons; ciliates had higher abundance in the wet season than in the dry season. This variation could be attributed to a possible increase of nitrogen and phosphorus washed into the lake by rain. Bioindication using ciliate abundance revealed that Lake Lanao in Wato-Balindong is ultraoligotrophic, i.e., the lake is pristine, well-oxygenated and low in nutrients during sampling.

J	Barrios, Y; Ramírez, N				Barrios, Yeni; Ramirez, Nelson			Floral biology and phenological overlap of angiosperms from a flooded forest, lake Maracaibo basin, Venezuela	ACTA BOTANICA MEXICANA												Background and Aims: Floral biology in tropical communities under seasonal climate has shown a preponderance of floral characters related with generalist pollination. In this context, we described the floral biology of 48 species from a seasonally flooded community with the aim of exploring the relationship between floral traits, examining the diversity of pollination syndromes and evaluating the effectiveness of this concept to predict pollinator classes. The overlap of flowering periods of species with the same pollination syndromes and/or pollinator classes was also explored in order to look for a pattern that could reflect the adverse effects of the pollinators overlap. Methods: The sexual system, dichogamy and/or hercogamy, type of pollination unit, dimensions, form, symmetry and spatial orientation of the flower, floral attractants and rewards, time of anthesis, floral longevity, pollination syndromes and pollinator classes were described for each species. Interspecific overlap was estimated using Pianka's index, and then contrasted with randomly generated values. Key results: Most species were hermaphrodite, adichogamous and not hercogamous; showed individual pollination units, with small dimensions, open forms, radial symmetry, horizontal orientation, white color, and nectar as the principal reward. Flowers showed mainly diurnal anthesis and short longevity, generally of one day. Melittophily was the predominant pollination syndrome and bees were the principal class of pollinators, even though some species were pollinated by more than one type of agent. Temporal distribution of flowering periods did not differ from what it expected from a random arrangement. Conclusions: The results allow us to conclude that beyond predictions from floral syndromes, in the community prevails an allophilic system that possibly results in greater pollination opportunities for plant species.

Episodic zooplanktivory by largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) on Daphnia: a 25-year natural history record from a small northern temperate lake	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												We observed episodic zooplanktivory by largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides; LMB) >= 150 mm total length (TL) on the cladoceran Daphnia spp. over two decades in a small oligotrophic lake. While zooplanktivory is beneficial for young-of-year and juvenile LMB, dietary utilization of Daphnia by adults is unusual because zooplankton are not energetically favorable and the LMB buccal cavity is poorly adapted for filter feeding. We classified the threshold of >= 38 Daphnia per feeding event as an episode of zooplanktivory based on data from a zooplankton specialist, the bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus). In this study, 1718 LMB were caught, marked, sampled, and released. Gut contents at the time of capture were collected via gastric lavage. We captured the same 612 LMB 3 or more times. Of these, approximately 26% had at least one episode of zooplanktivory and approximately 6% had multiple episodes. There was no relationship between the population sizes of Daphnia and LMB, but the yearly percentage of individual LMB with at least one episode of zooplanktivory significantly increased with LMB population density. Episodes of zooplanktivory were more likely to occur later in the season when Daphnia were more abundant in the lake. The probability of an individual LMB having a repeat episode of zooplanktivory was not significantly different from expected; however, the probability of a LMB not having a single episode was significantly greater than expected by random chance signifying that some LMB were better than others at eliminating Daphnia from their diets. The probability of episodic zooplanktivory significantly decreased with increasing fish TL and weight but significantly increased with increasing Daphnia abundance. LMB without episodes of zooplanktivory achieved significantly greater maximum weight and body condition factor than those with them, but there was no statistical difference in their maximum TL or longevity (duration between first and final capture of the same LMB). In contrast, LMB with episodes of zooplanktivory had significantly greater instantaneous growth rates than those without. These results suggest that LMB within the resource-limited lake partitioned prey resources when some LMB sporadically targeted under-utilized, energetically unfavorable prey.

J	Chen, B; Zhao, M				Chen, Bo; Zhao, Min			Intermittent inland waters as important carbon sources	CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE												\A large part of the world's inland waters, including streams, rivers, ponds, lakes, and reservoirs is subject to occasional, seasonal, or even permanent drying. Moreover, the intermittent inland waters are increasing in many areas of the world because of climate change, anthropogenic influence, and land-use change. However, information on the carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes from intermittent inland waters is scarce. Thus, a comprehensive assessment of CO2 emissions in intermittent inland waters is necessary and is a research gap in China. Here, we review the current knowledge on CO2 fluxes from lotic (streams and rivers) and lentic (ponds, lakes, and reservoirs) inland waters during dry and rewetting phases, considering controls and sources as well as implications of the two phases for local and global scale estimates. In exposed sediments of dry riverbeds, it can be a long time between wet and dry conditions. At the onset of drying, the increased oxygen availability can stimulate enzymatic activities and overall microbial growth, leading to an increased breakdown of organic matter and the subsequent release of CO2. As in any ecosystem, carbon emissions derive from a set of abiotic and biotic sources, the relative importance of which is tied to intrinsic features, such as geology, microbial communities and available organic substrates, and environmental controls, such as moisture and nutrient availability. Besides microbial respiration, geologic carbon can be a relevant source of CO2 emissions. Particularly in carbonate-rich regions, photodegradation of organic matter on dry light-exposed sediments can also lead to increased CO2 losses. In addition, covered vegetation metabolism, including photosynthesis and respiration, can be a relevant part of dry riverbed sediment CO2 emissions. Short rewetting episodes can trigger microbial respiration and CO2 release from the exposed sediments, and marked increases in the CO2 flux from dry sediments are to be expected during rewetting after a dry period, similar to soils, and it is known as the Birch effect. Immediately after rewetting, gases in pore spaces are displaced by water, potentially causing a significant efflux of CO2, impacting the overall annual CO2 flux. Rewetting events can also cause the remobilization of organic matter and nutrients. At the micro-scale, pore-filling will increase the dissemination of water-soluble substrates and mobilize labile substances from dead biomass. Aggregate disruption and the destabilization of organic-mineral complexes will also liberate carbon otherwise protected from microbial action. Other major drivers of CO2 fluxes from dry riverbeds include the presence or absence of vegetation or micro-phyto benthos in the exposed sediments, sediment texture, sediment temperature, and sediment organic matter. The organic matter quantity may be more important than the quality in controlling the magnitude of CO2 fluxes from the exposed sediments. Our conservative estimates indicate that adding emissions from intermittent inland waters to current global estimates of CO2 emissions from inland waters could result in an increase of 0.51 Pg C a(-1) or similar to 1/4 of total fluxes. Therefore, intermittent internal waters should be considered when estimating the CO2 emissions of global inland water. Future investigations should focus on the in-depth study of the main sources of uncertainty involved in carbon emissions from intermittent internal waters to understand the physical and biological mechanisms behind this flux, and the impact on the global carbon cycle. Important study topics include: (1) Accurate estimation of the area of intermittent inland waters, in particular, the area of small-flow rivers, scattered ponds, and the area of headwaters; (2) CO2 efflux measurement of dry riverbeds, including the determination of CO2 efflux directly and indirectly, and combining the two methods; (3) the mechanism of CO2 release from dry riverbeds and factors driving CO2 fluxes from intermittent inland waters, such as the ratio of autochthonous and allochthonous carbon in sediments during dry and rewetting episodes; and (4) deep understanding of the changes in extension and seasonality of intermittent internal waters, particularly those in response to climate oscillations, land-use changes, and potential feedback related to climate at decadal time-scales. The results from these additional studies will help explain completely the inland water carbon emissions and identify potential implications for regional and global carbon cycles.					; Zhao, Min/JGM-3156-2023	Chen, Bo/0009-0003-4067-3322; 													0023-074X	2095-9419					2020	65	16					1581	1591		10.1360/TB-2019-0868	http://dx.doi.org/10.1360/TB-2019-0868													WOS:000560205200007

Based on the long-term measured water level series (1956-2012), after the completion of TGD, the dry season in Lake Poyang is promoted to start early, and its duration is extended. With the regulation of TGD during the impoundment period, more outflow from Lake Poyang pours into the Yangtze River, leading to the decrement of lake water level and an earlier occurrence (about 4-5 days forward) of the dry season. Besides, with the regulation of TGD during the flushing period, the water level in Lake Poyang is elevated, making a relief to the lake drought during the dry season.																			1755-1307						2020	569								012065	10.1088/1755-1315/569/1/012065	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/569/1/012065													WOS:000654254300065

TEMPORAL VARIATION GOVERNS THE PROLIFERATION OF DIFFERENT TAXA OF GUILDS ULTRAPLANLTONIC FUNGI IN A LARGE RESERVOIR	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The fungus play an important role within the aquatic ecosystem. However, the ultraplanktonic fungus diversity in reservoir ecosystems is still greatly unexplored. In this study, we used Illumina sequencing technology to analyze the diversity of ultraplanktonic fungi (size class 0.7-5 mu m in this study) from two sampling sites along the Three Gorges Reservoir of the Yangtze River in China at four seasons in 2015. Basidiomycota was the most abundant phylum (36.69% of the total fungal reads), followed by Ascomycota (27.05%), Cryptomycota (18.06%), Chytridiomycota, (15.81%) and Blastocladiomycota (1.51%). Our study showed that ultraplanktonic fungi were changing with time, and a shift in dominant taxonomic groups was observed between time points. A marked temporal variation in functional guilds of fungi was also observed, suggesting that temporal variation governs the proliferation of different taxa or guilds of fungi in the reservoir. Our results suggest that inputs from fungal species of terrestrial origin may be responsible for the observed changes in pelagic community composition. This result also implies that terrestrial inputs may be an important source of fungal species in reservoir ecosystems. Additionally, it is possible that the chytrids were limited by hyperparasitic Cryptomycota.																			1589-1623	1785-0037					2020	18	6					7515	7533		10.15666/aeer/1806_75157533	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/1806_75157533													WOS:000604344600004

Reproductive Phenology and Size Structure Characteristics of Hypseleotris agilis (Herre, 1927) in Lake Mainit, Philippines	INTERNATIONAL LETTERS OF NATURAL SCIENCES												Hypseleotris agilis locally known as Bugwan, is a native species of commercial value in Lake Mainit, Philippines. A total of 1,584 H. agilis from Lake Mainit near the mouth of Kalinawan and Puyo River were caught from May 2018 to February 2019 to determine the length-weight relationship (LWR), condition factor (K), gonadosomatic index (GSI) and hepatosomatic index (HSI) of this species. Positive allometric growth was observed for both sexes (b>3). Sex ratio indicated the dominance of males over females as much as 58.7%. The number of ripe males and gravid females was observed throughout the months of the collection, which indicates the ability of the fish species to spawn continuously throughout the year. The determination of GSI in both sexes showed higher values during November (males) and December (females). However, HSI values were relatively low during the spawning season, which would indicate the usage of energy for gonadal maturation. The K factor showed high values during the peak spawning months, directly proportional to GSI values. This study provides baseline information on reproductive parameters and size structure for the management and conservation of this important fishery resource in Lake Mainit.						jumawan, joycelyn/0000-0002-2384-851X													2300-9675						2020	80						35	42		10.18052/www.scipress.com/ILNS.80.35	http://dx.doi.org/10.18052/www.scipress.com/ILNS.80.35													WOS:000599231000004

Eichhornia crassipes is a floating aquatic that is highly invasive in hypertrophic water. The proliferation of water hyacinth closure from the surface water column by decreasing the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the bottom water column, causing disturbance to the growth of aquaculture fish, so it is necessary to control/eradicate the water hyacinth weed. The technology to control/eliminate water hyacinth is physical, biological, and chemical or a combination of the three. Technology to control/eradicate water hyacinth must consider the negative impact on the environment. Some technologies to eradicate water hyacinth are positive and significant using filled Chinese carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) or confined in cages depending on the body of water. The caged system in lake waters considers fish and native/endemic plants while in reservoir water with a stocking system. In the lake waters, aquaculture is carried out with a floating net cage system measuring 5 x 5 x 5 m(3) with a total of 100 plots, each plot filled with 500 Chinese carp (100 g/fish) fed 50 kg of water hyacinth on day-1. The maintenance period is 3 months per season for 3 seasons (1 year). The results show that water hyacinth is reduced by 300 ha. The adoption of technology to improve water quality is one of the management of water bodies to increase fish production.																			1755-1307						2020	521								012011	10.1088/1755-1315/521/1/012011	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/521/1/012011													WOS:000623518000011

Long-Term Analysis of Water Quality in Chilika Lagoon and Application of Bio-optical Models for Cyclone Impact Assessment	ECOLOGY, CONSERVATION, AND RESTORATION OF CHILIKA LAGOON, INDIA	Wetlands Ecology Conservation and Management											A comprehensive analysis of sediment and phytoplankton dynamics in Chilika lagoon by synthesizing various remote sensing datasets is presented in this study. The goal of the study was to monitor and analyze the spatio-temporal variability of total suspended sediment (TSS) and chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration and associated environmental forcings in the coastal lagoon. NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance cloud free data was used to develop a TSS and chl-a model. Finally, a case study showing implication of satellite based TSS and Chl-a models to assess the impacts of natural hazards such as cyclones on water quality of Chilika Lagoon is presented. This case study is based on comparing the effect of two anniversary very severe cyclonic storms (VSCSs): category-5 Phailin (12 October, 2013) and category-4 Hudhud (12 October, 2014) that impacted the lagoon. Analysis for 14 years (2001-2014) using MODIS 8-day composites (MOD09Q1) data indicated that the seasonal variability of TSS is dominant in all the three sectors of the lagoon compared to inter-annual variability. The main reason for large variations in the northern sector is the shallow depth and intrusion of large sediment discharge from Mahanadi River from the northern side, which is the largest fresh water distributary for Chilika Lagoon. Anniversary cyclone impact analysis revealed that Phailin's impact on Chilika Lagoon and its watershed resulted in unprecedented levels of precipitation and runoff before-during-after the landfall, which shattered the typical sectorial turbidity gradient. Exponential increase in turbidity because of a combination of run-off and wind driven re-suspension of fine sediments resulted in strong attenuation of light in water column post-Phailin. Limited light condition coupled with enhanced flushing rate due to flooded river and increased freshwater discharge reduced the Chl-a concentration after the passage of Phailin. In contrast, relatively farther landfall location, trajectory away from the lagoon, relatively lower wind intensity and short duration of stay of VSCS Hudhud, led to lesser precipitation and surface runoff compared to Phailin. Consequently, lagoon did not experience a drastic increase in turbidity and light attenuation. Sufficient light availability, stable wind, reduced flushing all favored the phytoplankton growth after passage of Hudhud and thus, Chl-a concentration increased almost threefold in all the sectors of the lagoon. The approach used in this study can be applied to other cyclone-prone coastal areas. Coupling of satellite based observation with modelling output from systems such as Giovanni can improve monitoring program implemented in numerous coastal estuaries and lagoons.

Application of methods for processing and analysis of satellite images for the study of eutrophied reservoirs (review)	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY												The review discusses the existing approaches and algorithms used to assess the water quality of inland water bodies in various climatic zones, provides formulas for calculating the most commonly used spectral indices (Chl-a, MCI, NDVI, Turb). The possibilities of using data of remote sensing of the Earth from various sensors (Modis-Terra, Modis-Aqua, Landsat 5, Landsat 7, Landsat 8, Sentinel-2, Sentinel-3) to study the quality of water in inland waters are described. Many researchers note the great potential of the Sentinel-3 satellite for studying inland waters with complex optical conditions (high turbidity, color, colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and total suspended matter). It is shown that the optical properties of inland waters differ depending on the trophic status of the reservoir, on the season of the year, the physicochemical composition of water, the species composition of phytoplankton and other factors. Currently, both traditional methods and new improved algorithms are used to monitor the state of water bodies with complex optical conditions. Various methods of atmospheric corrections and calibrated spectral indices are used, classifications of reservoirs by the presence of phytoplankton particles, suspended particles of organic and inorganic matter, and CDOM are developed. It was noted that the concentration of chlorophyll a and the turbidity of the water are the most important biophysical parameters used to assess the quality of water and determine the ecological status of inland waters.

J	Shen, S; Shimizu, Y				Shen, Shang; Shimizu, Yoshihisa			Contribution of large bacteria to bacterial biomass in a deep freshwater lake (Lake Biwa, Japan)	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Despite the importance of bacterial cell volume in microbial ecology in aquatic environments, literature regarding the effects of seasonal and spatial variations on bacterial cell volume remains scarce. We used transmission electron microscopy to examine seasonal and spatial variations in bacterial cell size for 18 mo in 2 layers (epilimnion 0.5 m and hypolimnion 60 m) of Lake Biwa, Japan, a large and deep freshwater lake. During the stratified period, we found that the bacterial cell volume in the hypolimnion ranged from 0.017 to 0.12 mu m(3) (median), whereas that in the epilimnion was less variable (0.016 to 0.033 mu m(3), median) and much lower than that in the hypolimnion. Additionally, in the hypolimnion, cell volume during the stratified period was greater than that during the mixing period (up to 5.7-fold). These differences in cell volume resulted in comparable bacterial biomass in the hypolimnion and epilimnion, despite the fact that there was lower bacterial abundance in the hypolimnion than in the epilimnion. We also found that the biomass of larger bacteria, which are not likely to be grazed by heterotrophic nanoflagellates, increased in the hypolimnion during the stratified period. Our data suggest that estimation of carbon flux (e.g. bacterial productivity) needs to be interpreted cautiously when cell volume is used as a constant parametric value. In deep freshwater lakes, a difference in cell volume with seasonal and spatial variation may largely affect estimations.

J	Singh, S; Singh, M				Singh, Sandeep; Singh, Munendra			Spatial variability of Sr isotope of Gomati River Basin within Ganga Alluvial Plain: Implications for global seawater fluxioning	GEOCHEMICAL JOURNAL												The continuous increase of the Sr-87/Sr-86 isotopic ratio in the seawater since last 40 Ma has been correlated with the rise of the Himalaya. The Ganga-Brahmputra Fluvial System drains the Himalaya along with the Ganga Alluvial Plain (GAP) and the northern Indian Craton regions. Under the humid subtropical climatic condition, the rivers of the alluvial plain contribute a significant (similar to 50%) in the water discharge. Previous studies have identified the Himalayan Rivers as a potential source for the steady increase of marine Sr budget; overlooking the contribution of alluvial rivers. We attempt to constrain the role of GAP as a source for Sr. The Gomati River, a 900 km-long tributary of the Ganga River, drains about 30,437 km(2) of the GAP with 7,390 x 10(6) m(3)/a water discharge and provides an ideal opportunity to understand the role of GAP in contribution of the global Sr-87 budget. A total of 44 river water, 33 groundwater, 6 rainwater, 3 lake water, and 13 alluvial sediment samples were analyzed for Sr-87/Sr-86 isotopic ratio to determine sources and mixing relationships of the rainwater, groundwater and river water within the GAP. In the Gomati River Basin, the average Sr isotopic ratio of the river water (0.7292) is higher than that of the average Ganga River water (0.7246) and much higher than that of world seawater (0.7119) and modern seawater (0.7092). The average Sr isotopic ratio of the shallow groundwater and rainwater was 0.7242 and 0.7139, respectively. The Gomati River drains the GAP having alluvial sediments with more radiogenic Sr isotopic ratio ranging from 0.7655 to 0.7244. Due to this, the river water displays strong seasonal variability with lower Sr isotopic ratio than groundwater during the monsoon season (0.7184). Our data indicate that the high water discharge contribution with reasonably higher Sr isotopic values from GAP river water makes it an important additional source of high radiogenic Sr in addition to the Himalayan source. The chemical weathering of alluvial sediments in GAP under the monsoon-controlled climatic condition is likely to make significant contributions to the evolution and budget of Sr isotope in the global sea.

The main sources of mobile phosphorus include water flowing from arable land, residential areas, farms, transport routes, and sewage treatment plants. It is therefore necessary to seek new methods of further reducing mobile phosphorus concentrations in surface waters. In efforts to find new ways of effective utilization of existing objects in environmental protection, the role of small constructed wetlands in providing additional treatment to flowing waters has been examined. Such objects are of low depth, with intensive water exchange and mixing. These features play an important role in matter transformation. The intensity of biogenic absorption depends mainly on water pollution, ecological condition of the wetland, season of the year, inflowing contamination load and retention time [2].

This combination of physical features makes the groundwater and aquifers highly vulnerable to contamination from synthetic chemicals commonly referred to as contaminants of emerging concern (CECs). The use of septic tanks, otherwise referred to as onsite water treatment systems (OWTS), promotes the introduction of CECs into the environment. In order to study the impacts of CECs from OWTS on a karst landscape, water, sediment, and vegetation samples were collected in a sinkhole lake surrounded by residential housing using this waste disposal method. The main question of this research project is what is the fate of CECs from OWTSs effluent within the catchment of a sinkhole lake? Liquid chromatograph mass spectrometry was used to analyze the samples for the presence of CECs. It was found that the relative quantity of CECs in the individual constituents is dependent upon 1) the hydrophobicity and polarity of the individual compound, 2) the specific sampling site, 3) the topography gradient, and 4) for vegetation, the connectedness of the sample type to the sediment. Hydrogeological studies have found that the sinkholes of the area are all connected to the below aquifer. Consequently, these CECs pose a risk of the contamination of the groundwater. This study is a temporal snapshot, that being the dry season of Florida which is most likely the time of lowest CEC contamination. It is imperative that sampling extend into the wet season when flushing of CECs from the OWTS may increase their concentrations in both the lake but also the aquifers especially since residents use well water as their source of potable water. While this study is based in Florida, we strongly suspect that our findings and recommendations are applicable more generally as OWTS are used throughout the many karst regions of the world.					van Beynen, Philip/G-5653-2017														0583-6050	1580-2612					2020	49	2-3					229	240		10.3986/ac.v49i2-3.8007	http://dx.doi.org/10.3986/ac.v49i2-3.8007													WOS:000603365400006

European perch, Petra fluviatilis Linnaeus, 1758, is a predatory freshwater fish present also in the coastal waters of the Baltic Sea. The available catch data indicate that the population profile of this species is disrupted, and the condition of the population is not stable. The aim of this study was to determine the diversity and genetic structure of and assess phylogenetic links and gene flow between selected perch populations originating from various types of reservoirs in northern Poland. Materials and methods. A total of 392 perch were collected from selected bodies of water in north-western Poland and the fin samples were preserved in 96% ethanol or stored for short periods at -20 degrees C. Genomic DNA was isolated, while for further mitochondrial DNA analysis, a 1081-bp fragment of the control region was amplified. Amplification products were sequenced and subjected to restriction analysis (PCR-RFLP) in order to determine the genetic diversity of the control region of mtDNA. The obtained sequences were analyzed using bioinformatics tools, and phylogenetic trees were generated to determine the degree of diversity between individuals in selected perch stocks. Results. Seven haplotypes were identified. Ten polymorphic sites were defined, and the degree of genetic diversity between selected haplotypes was determined. Based on the distribution of perch haplotypes, stocks from Pomeranian Bay (haplotypes F, D), the Szczecin Lagoon (haplotypes D, F, H), and the more homogeneous stocks from Pomeranian Bay (haplotypes F, D) and the Kamietiski Lagoon (D, F) can be distinguished. Analysis of phylogenetic relations allowed identifying stocks with the most conserved genome, similar to the standard perch genome, and stocks that have become more genetically distant, probably due to the diversity of the inhabited ecosystems or natural hybridization observed in this species. Conclusions. European perch inhabiting waters of north-western Poland is a species with high plasticity, without isolated stocks or populations that can be clearly distinguished on a genetic basis. It does, however, have a tendency for mitochondrial genomic modifications, which is likely due to the broad spectrum of ecosystems inhabited by the species. Due to the homogeneity of the perch populations from the Szczecin Lagoon, the Kamienski Lagoon, and Lake Mysliborslcie, they should be used for the restoration of populations in water bodies in which their genetic structure is severely disrupted. For the same reason, the policy of perch catches should be modified. The authors suggest increasing the protected size to 20 cm and limiting the catches of the species as by-catch by modifying fishing tools, including the introduction of a seasonal prohibition of tools that might eliminate individuals of 15-16 cm in length from natural waters in their spawning period.

According to the results, the total number of DNA fingerprint bands of the planktonic bacteria were between 18-25 for each month. A seasonal variation was observed as the eutrophication months exhibited a significantly higher proportion in the number of DNA fingerprint bands in comparison to other months. The dominant populations in this landscape water body included Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroides, Planocomycetes, Cyanobacteria, among which Bacteroidetes, Nitrobacteria and Cyanobacteria demonstrated the highest abundance in July and August. When combined with the variation and qualities of water body, it was found that the bacterial diversity was positively correlated with the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and the content of chlorophyll-a, but negatively correlated with dissolved oxygen (DO) and total nitrogen (TN). These findings suggest that there is a close association between microorganism, physicochemical factors of water body and algae. High temperature and high nutrition cause eutrophication of water, improve the diversity of planktonic bacteria, and accelerate the evolution of bacterial population in closed landscape water body.																			1018-4619	1610-2304					2020	29	10					9334	9344																WOS:000588493600066

Therefore, there has a strong need to investigate and understand the Lakefront wetland changes in Dongting Lake. In this paper, we selected Landsat image to study the Lakefront wetland in Dongting Lake in dry season from 1979 to 2016. Lakefront wetland information was classified to four categories: grassland, mud flat. waterbody and others. On this basis, we obtained the lakefront wetland distribution map of Dongting Lake by using maximum likelihood method. The results showed that from 1979 to 1995. lakefront wetland area in Dongting Lake decreased continuously. Among them, lakefront wetland area decreased by 170.4 km(2) from 1979 to 1987, in which lakefront wetland mainly transferred to waterbody, in the area of 161.85 km(2). From 1987 to 1995, lakefront wetland area decreased by 282.3 km(2), in which lakefront wetland area mainly transferred to other land cover types, with a transfer of 507.32 km(2). From 1995 to 2016. land wetland wetland area continued to increase, especially from 2005 to 2016, with an increase of 698.4 km(2), mainly in transfer of other land cover types to lakefront wetlands, transferring 588,65 km(2), Based on lakefront wetland area change study, in this paper, we further analyzed the impact of temperature, rainfall, and water level on change of lakefront wetland in Dongting Lake and its correlation. Water level and rainfall are negatively correlated with lakefront wetland area, and the correlation between temperature and lakefront wetland area is not obvious.

The results showed that (1) Three fluorescent components were obtained using PARAFAC, including a humic-like C1, a tryptophan-like C2 and a tyrosine-like C3. (2) After 28 days of bio-incubation, the bioavailability of dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) in Lake Hongze and Lake Luoma in dry season (17% +/- 4% and 15%+/- 4%) was higher than that in flood season (5%715% and 10% +/- 7%) , and the high %BDOC values of the two lakes were mainly distributed in the inflowing river mouths. (3) The specific absorbance at 254 nm SUVA(254) and humic-like components in the two lakes during dry season was significantly higher than that pre-bio-incubation, and Delta SUVA(254) and Delta C1 were negative. The tyrosine-like component was significantly lower than that pre-bio-incubation and Delta C3 was positive, indicating that the microorganisms preferentially utilized the less stable tyrosine-like component in the dry season, and produced more stable humic-like C1 and also increased the humification of the samples collected from the two lakes. (4) There were significant negative correlations between BDOC, %BDOC and Delta SUVA(254), Delta C3, %Delta C3, respectively. These results indicated that CDOM optical composition directly affects its bioavailability in the two lakes.					kai, peng/JDV-6569-2023; Liu, Zhao/B-2189-2012														1000-0593					JAN	2020	40	1					85	90		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2020)01-0085-06	http://dx.doi.org/10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2020)01-0085-06													WOS:000512216000015

TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION CHARACTERISTICS OF RHIZOSPHERE ORGANIC ACIDS UNDER WATER LEVEL FLUCTUATIONS IN THREE TYPES OF LAKES IN CHINA	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Organic acids are influenced by many factors, such as season variations, water levels, vegetation and others. In the study, the rhizosphere soils of lakeshore plants in Poyang Lake, Chaohu Lake and Wuchang Lake in China were sampled under different water level fluctuations, and the amounts of organic acids were measured. Water level fluctuations affect the temporal and spatial characteristics of rhizosphere organic acids. The annual average of the total amount of organic acids in the rhizosphere soil of lakeshore plants in Wuchang Lake was higher than that in the other lakes. The seasonal variations in the amounts of organic acids were the same in the three lakes. The total amounts of organic acids in the rhizosphere soils at high water level sites were higher than those in the low water level sites of the three lakes. The effects of the interactions of season variations and water level fluctuations on the amount of organic acids in the rhizosphere were significant. The results revealed that the lake types changed in response to anthropogenic influence; Wuchang Lake, as a quasi-natural lake, suffered from much more human pollutants than Chaohu Lake as a reservoir-like lake and Poyang Lake as an intermittent lake.																			1589-1623	1785-0037					2020	18	5					7201	7214		10.15666/aeer/1805_72017214	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/1805_72017214													WOS:000585225100071
J	Baldwin, CM; Polacek, M				Baldwin, Casey M.; Polacek, Matt			Abundance and seasonal shifts in vertical and horizontal distribution of lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) in a western United States reservoir	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												A series of studies have been implemented on Banks Lake, Washington, in recent years with the overall objective to maximize the fishery by determining the factors that limit the recruitment of various sport fish. When sampling commenced, it became apparent that the lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) was a major component of the system. The purpose of this study was to estimate the species composition, distribution, and abundance of the limnetic fish community of Banks Lake using hydroacoustics and gill nets. Surveys were conducted in May and July to test for differences in seasonal distribution and efficacy of the survey gear to establish a time period for conducting annual surveys for trend monitoring. Whitefish dominated the limnetic gill-net species composition by weight (95% both months) and number (83% July and 88% May). In May, relatively few fish were distributed deeper than 8 m at the south end of the reservoir, and low densities were common for the deepest strata (16 24 m). In July, most fish were in the deepest strata available, 16-24m throughout most of the reservoir. Reservoir-wide mean fish density was not significantly different between May and July, but acoustic target distribution varied by depth and location within and between surveys. In July, fish were concentrated near the North Dam where cooler water was being pumped in from Lake Roosevelt and in Devil's Lake embayment where deeper bottom depths offered a cool water refuge. These areas represent cool water refuge for salmonids and will be key spatial considerations for future fish management actions.																			0270-5060					JUN	2011	26	2					171	183		10.1080/02705060.2011.554216	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2011.554216													WOS:000292949200004

Although both species differ in ecological spectra, they can co-occur in the same lakes. Morphological differences given in identification keys can be problematic in the field study. Therefore, additional features were tested and suggested as possibly useful, supplementary differences. 10 individuals of both species growing under similar conditions (littoral of a meromictic, mesotrophic lake, mid-Western Poland) were collected in the vegetation season 2005. Statistical tests evidenced that out of 9 features 6 differed the studied species. Axis diameter, the length of internodes and the length of branchlets revealed the most significant differences. Chara virgata is smaller than Chara globularis even in similar or common habitats. The proposed branchlet length: internode length ratio, higher for Chara virgata than for Chara globularis, can be applied as a useful measure for the species differentiation, particularly under conditions where both charophytes co-occur.

These three chemicals are among the primary pre-emergent herbicides applied to corn. MCLs and MCLGs are compared to annual average concentrations for regulatory purposes. However, annual average concentrations are much less frequently reported than post-application seasonal averages. In most cases, both seasonal and annual average concentrations are substantially less than the MCLs or MCLG. However, actual and estimated annual mean concentrations occasionally exceed the MCLs or MCLG. Actual or estimated exceedences occur more frequently for atrazine and cyanazine than for alachlor, and may occur more frequently in lakes or reservoirs with long retention times than in streams and rivers. Additional year round data, and data for lakes and reservoirs, are needed to determine the extent to which such exceedences occur throughout the corn belt. The American Water Works Association (AWWA) believes that substantial numbers of Community Water Systems (CWSs) within the corn belt are currently, or will be, in violation of the revised Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) with respect to atrazine and cyanazine. They are concerned that such violations could result in numerous CWSs having to implement expensive tertiary treatment systems such as granular activated carbon to decrease herbicide concentrations. The United States Environmental Protection Agency, (US EPA) is continuing to review data on the pesticide concentrations in reservoirs and lakes that registrants have been submitting over the last 18 mo under the 6(a)(2) adverse impact provision of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). The US EPA is also currently using computer modeling and other methods to evaluate potential alternative and/or supplemental herbicides to reduce atrazine use. In June 1992, the US EPA approved revised labeling that is designed to reduce indirect atrazine loadings to surface waters. Additional mitigation methods have been proposed and are being considered.																			0890-037X					OCT-DEC	1994	8	4					852	861		10.1017/S0890037X00028815	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0890037X00028815													WOS:A1994QA12000033
J	BROCK, MA				BROCK, MA			MECHANISMS FOR MAINTAINING PERSISTENT POPULATIONS OF MYRIOPHYLLUM-VARIIFOLIUM HOOKER,J. IN A FLUCTUATING SHALLOW AUSTRALIAN LAKE	AQUATIC BOTANY												Plant populations in many shallow Australian lakes are subject to wide fluctuations of environmental factors such as drying and rewetting of habitats seasonally or aseasonally. This paper examines the life-cycle and reproductive flexibility, and exchange of reproductive material between habitats, as a means of maintaining persistent populations of the same species in different habitats. In a shallow Australian lake, Myriophyllum variifolium J. Hooker grows in both temporary and permanent water habitats separated by a zone of open water. Established plants in these two habitats differ in growth form, yet produce both asexual and sexual propagules. Field experiments and observations on the germination, growth and reproduction of this species demonstrate that the populations of established plants in both habitats have means of contributing to the establishment of new plants in either habitat under a range of environmental conditions. Such flexibility of life-cycle pattern and plasticity of growth form enhance survival in these widely fluctuating environments.																			0304-3770					FEB	1991	39	1-2					211	219		10.1016/0304-3770(91)90033-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(91)90033-2													WOS:A1991FC98500017

During fructification vacuolar sap contained a mean of 41 mol m-3 (range 10.2-61.8) sucrose. The mean turgor pressure was 239 mosmol kg-1 (range 219-264). In long- and short-term experiments these plants were subjected to increasing salinities up to 22-parts-per-thousand. When salinity was increased from 1.5 to 4.4-parts-per-thousand turgor pressure was restored to only 80% of the initial value. This reduced level of turgor pressure was maintained up to a salinity of 22-parts-per-thousand. The increase in vacuolar osmotic potential was due to the monovalent ions Na+, K+ and Cl-. The relative amounts of Na+ and K+ participating in the regulation process were dependent on external salinity. The regulatory mechanisms observed in the brackish water species Ch. canescens are compared with those reported from freshwater and euryhaline species.																			0932-8629					FEB	1991	104	1					37	46		10.1111/j.1438-8677.1991.tb00191.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1438-8677.1991.tb00191.x													WOS:A1991FE72300005

Average mouth width varied by season and year and per lake. Of two groups of feeding specialists distinguished in each population chironomid feeders showed a smaller mouth width compared to fish feeders of the same body length. Proportions of these specialists differed between years, lakes, and seasons and changed in response to changing feeding conditions. The shift to fish feeding occurred when chironomid biomass decreased and young fish recruited. The shift was greatest in the year when chironomids collapsed completely and in the lakes with high eel densities. Mature males were narrow-headed and left the lakes at sizes between 30 and 40 cm. Larger eels were always broad-headed females. Implications for foraging efficiency and population structure are discussed.																			0378-1909	1573-5133				SEP	1989	26	1					63	75		10.1007/BF00002476	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00002476													WOS:A1989AR11400005
J	LAZZARETTI, MA; HANSELMANN, KW				LAZZARETTI, MA; HANSELMANN, KW			THE ROLE OF SEDIMENTS IN THE PHOSPHORUS CYCLE IN LAKE LUGANO .2. SEASONAL AND SPATIAL VARIABILITY OF MICROBIOLOGICAL PROCESSES AT THE SEDIMENT-WATER INTERFACE	AQUATIC SCIENCES												P, Fe, Mn, and S species were analyzed in water samples from the sediment-water interface collected at four seasonally different times during the course of a year at two sampling sites in the southern basin of Lake Lugano (Lago di Lugano). The results reveal the strong influence of the biogeochemical processes in the sediment on the chemical composition of the lake water above. Consumption of oxygen and nitrate under oxic to microoxic conditions in the water column as well as sequential release of reduced manganese and iron under anoxic conditions was observed as a direct or indirect consequence of microbially mediated degradation of organic matter. The seasonal pattern observed for the release and the retainment of dissolved reduced iron and manganese correlates well with the one for dissolved phosphate. Iron, manganese and phosphorus cycling are coupled tightly in these sediments. Both sediment types act as sinks for hydrogen sulfide and sulfate. An inner-sedimentary sulfur cycle is proposed to couple iron, manganese and phosphorus cycling with the degradation of organic matter. Nutrient cycling at the sediment-water interface might thus be driven by a microbially regulated ''electron pumping'' mechanism. The results contribute to a better understanding of the role of sediment processes in the lake's internal phosphorus cycle and its seasonal dynamics.																			1015-1621						1992	54	3-4					285	299		10.1007/BF00878142	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00878142													WOS:A1992KD90400008

J	FRANZ, D				FRANZ, D			MATING SYSTEM AND STRATEGY OF REPRODUCTION IN PENDULINE TIT REMIZ P PENDULINUS	JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												From 1978 to 1987, 477 nests of the Penduline Tit were checked in Bavaria and Austria. Adult birds were marked individually with colour rings. In northern Bavaria, the major part of Penduline Tits started building nests in April and May (median date: May 10). As early as end of May a large number was leaving the breeding grounds. The population in the riverine forests of the river March/Austria basically followed the same cycle. On the other hand, birds breeding at Lake Neusiedl/Austria arrived as late as the beginning of June (median date for start of nestbuilding: June 23). A generally valid seasonal pattern for both sexes see fig. 1, 2. Penduline Tits exhibit uniparental care. Most of the nests (about 60 %) were attended by females, about 10 % by male and about 30 % were deserted, because neither the female nor the male decided to incubate (tab. 1). Early in the year, clutches were reared by the female or abandoned; preferably at the end of the breeding season males incubated. A significant relation between clutch size and season could be found at Illmitz/Austria. If average clutch size for female, male or no care are compared with the average clutch size of the respective five-day periods in which the medians of the three categories were found, a significantly smaller clutch size was apparent in abandoned nests. Due to extensive migratory behaviour during the breeding season, a calender effect of clutch size was not calculated for the Upper Main/Bavaria. However, clutch size in nests incubated by females exceeded the size of the abandoned ones. The incubation of smaller clutches by males in the same area is hard to explain. Insufficient data and/or the lack of potential mates as a consequence of early migration may account for it. If a female decides to abandon a nest she evidently leave the clutch incomplete, as if to give the male a "commission" to care for the young. Thereby, females economize on their reserves in order to be able to produce additional clutches with other males. To achieve optimal reproductive success both sexes follow different strategies. Males: During the whole breeding season males are able to construct a large number of nests to attract as many females as possible. At the end of the breeding season, when only few females are available, some of the males care for their broods themselves. Females: At the beginning of the breeding season, most females are ready to incubate complete clutches. But already at this time, approximately 30 % of the females desert incomplete clutches so as trying "to give commission" for brood care to the male. The battle of the sexes arises, if both sexes abandon the clutch. This conflict may probably be explained by the "game theory". Due to the migrations during breeding season, an exact documentation of the mating status of individual birds was limited. Polygamy occured at least in 25 % of the males and 12 % of the females (tab. 4). A number of unpaired males was also evident during the whole breeding season. Polygynous males reached higher breeding success (tab. 8), and were larger (wing-length) as compared to the other males. Older males may be more successful than younger. According to the number of males leaving nests, the rate of polygyny might be up to 60 % and, due to the number of clutches abandoned by females, approx. 30 % of them are polyandrous. However, polyandrous behaviour was not linked to an increased reproduction rate. Especially at the beginning of the breeding season, most of the nests deserted by females were completely abandoned. Some females were able to raise two broods in one season.																			2193-7192	2193-7206				JUL	1991	132	3					241	266		10.1007/BF01640533	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01640533													WOS:A1991GD11300001

The planktonic ciliate communities of eleven organically coloured north and central Florida [USA] lakes representing a variety of trophic conditions were examined during 1979-80. The total abundance and biomass of ciliates were not significantly different from comparable clearwater lakes and only minor taxonomic replacements were noted at the order level. 2. Timing of population peaks of oligotrophic lakes was dissimilar to clearwater lakes of the same trophic state, but seasonally in mesotrophic and eutrophic lakes resembled patterns desribed for comparable clearwater lakes. 3. Various ciliate components were strongly correlated with chloropyhyll a concentrations, but only moderately correlated to dominant phytoplankton groups. No significant correlations were found between ciliate components and bacterial abundance. 4. Myxotrophic taxa numerically dominated oligotrophic systems, particularly during midsummer, and accounted for a large percentage of the total ciliate biomass. Estimates of the ciliate contribution to total autotrophic biomass indicate that these zoochlorellae-bearing protozoa may account for much of the autotrophic biomass during midsummer periods in coloured lakes, and thus may lead to an overestimation of phytoplanton standing crops available to zooplankton grazers if chlorophyll a is used as a surrogate measure of algal biomass.

Tissue Hg levels in mink and otter were significantly different among locations. For example, the mean Hg concentrations in mink liver from the English River, Turkey Lakes, Muskoka, Sudbury, and Cambridge areas were 2.55, 2.36, 2.17, 0.56, and 0.14 .mu.g/g, respectively. Mercury levels in fish and crayfish from the study areas followed a similar pattern. Mink and otters are, therefore, sensitive bioindicators of environmental Hg levels.

Due to less attention on their effects in Iraqi aquatic ecosystems, concentrations of surfactants in sediment were determined to assess their potential risks in Tigris River. Four sites were selected to collect sediment samples from February 2017 to February 2018. Anionic (AS) and nonionic surfactants (NS) were extracted from sediment by ultrasonic device and their concentrations were measured by using colorimetric determination Photo lab S12 and high-performance liquid chromatography. In addition, multiple physicochemical parameters were also measured. Results showed that both AS and NS were detectable in all sites for all months with slight variations, suggesting high washing activities that release directly to the river, causing surfactants to adsorb and accumulate in the sediment for a long time before degradation by microbial communities. High NS concentrations were recorded in the dry season for May 2017 at Al-Dora Bridge, suggesting that the NS, especially their degradation products (nonylphenol), were widespread pollutants compared with AS in the dry season. We recommend that these compounds must be monitored and further investigated in order to determine their effects on fish and other aquatic organisms.

It is far from settlements as well as not affected by fishing or other human activities and, therefore, its biota can be considered as a source of reference data for a coastal wetland in favourable conditions. Benthic ostracod communities were studied throughout the annual cycle (every second month) at three stations in the wetland. Two euryhaline and eurythermal ostracod species were recorded: Cyprideis torosa and Loxoconcha elliptica. They were present at all three stations and in all seasonal samples, showing substantial spatial and temporal variations. Cyprideis torosa was the dominant species, while L. elliptica was a secondary species. The abundance of C. torosa and L. elliptica was positively correlated with the air temperature, water temperature and salinity but negatively correlated with the oxygen saturation.

We collected walleye from the upper, middle, and lower regions of the reservoir in 1993 and, using the relative importance (RI) index, compared walleye food habits in 1993 with those from a similar study of Lake Oahe conducted in 1991. Rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) had higher RI values than other prey in all regions of the reservoir throughout 1993. In 1991, rainbow smelt dominated the diet of walleye only in the lower portion of the reservoir. Ephemeridae and chironomidae were the only macroinvertebrates found in the walleye diet; however, neither constituted a large portion of the diet in either year. Seasonal importance did, however, vary slightly among sites as diets became more diverse in the upper reaches of the reservoir. The predominance of rainbow smelt in the diet of walleye throughout the reservoir in 1993 was probably due to cooler water temperatures and increased reservoir volume. Cooler water temperatures in 1993 allowed rainbow smelt to occupy areas where water temperatures exceeded their upper thermal limit in 1991.																			0270-5060					MAR	1995	10	1					1	10		10.1080/02705060.1995.9663411	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1995.9663411													WOS:A1995QM53800001

Quantitative benthic samples were collected montly between June 1984 and May 1985 from seven stations at various depths in Lake Zwai, one of the Ethiopian Rift Valley lakes, situated in the northern part of the Rift Valley. The most common species of ostracods were Limnocythere thomasi thomasi Martens (a subspecies endemic to Lake Zwai), Gomphocythere angulata Lowndes (common in, but restricted to, East Africa) and Darwinula stevensoni (Brady & Robertson) (cosmopolitan). 2. Absolute densities of all species varied considerably over the year. In all stations, there were population peaks during the two dry seasons, followed by as yet unexplained population crashes during the short and the long rains. 3. The three common species had different habitat preferences. Darwinula stevensoni avoids parts of the lake where temperatures rise high and both G. angulata and L. thomasi had a preference for sheltered habitats close to vegetation and/or for a specific grain size of the sediment (300-350-mu-m).

The whitings were most intense during September, when 12-56% of the total particle volume was calcite. Overall, food web dynamics were more controlling of than contolled by whitings. Year-to-year variation in calcite concentration was probably caused by predation-controlled variation in primary production, which drives calcite precipitation through CO2 uptake. Feeding rate of cladocerans in Lake Michigan is slightly reduced (16%) by calcite, but that of copepods is not. Light extinction is only slightly increased. Coprecipitation and sinking of P with calcite is probably a minor factor in regulating P concentration in the epilimnion of Lake Michigan. Removal of nutrients is enhanced by increasing sinking rates caused by inclusion of calcite in fecal pellets and matter. Although all of the effects of calcite on plankton dynamics appear to be subtle in Lake Michigan, large effects can be expected for lakes of greater calcium hardness and eutrophy.

Thirty-two of the carp contained zebra mussels; the proportion of carp feeding on mussels appeared to be related to the density of mussels at the site where they were collected. One of the only two carp collected during the lake trout spawning season on lake trout spawning habitat contained over 100 lake trout eggs. The fouling of cobble substrate by zebra mussels probably prevented the eggs from settling into interstitial spaces, thereby making the eggs vulnerable to carp predation.

Modern Sedimentation System of Lake Untersee, East Antarctica	GEOCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL												The paper presents data on the geographic and geological conditions of modern sedimentation in Lake Untersee, the largest lake in East Antarctica. Geochemical and sedimentation data indicate that the leading mechanism providing Al-Si sedimentary material to the surface layer of the bottom sediments is the seasonal melting of the Anuchin glacier and the mountain glacier on the southeastern face of the valley hosting the lake. The strongly reduced conditions in the lowermost 25 m of the water column in the smaller of the two depressions at the lake bottom were favorable for the enrichment of the bottom sediments in bacteriogenic organic matter, Mo, Au, and Pd. The H(2)S-contaminated water facilitates the significant enrichment of the sediments only in redox-sensitive elements able to migrate in the form of anionic complexes and precipitate (coprecipitate) as sulfides.

J	SOMMER, U				SOMMER, U			CONVERGENT SUCCESSION OF PHYTOPLANKTON IN MICROCOSMS WITH DIFFERENT INOCULUM SPECIES COMPOSITION	OECOLOGIA												Different initial mixtures of phyto- and zooplankton from different lakes were grown under identical chemical and physical conditions in medium size (8- and 12-1) laboratory microcosm cultures until convergence of phytoplankton species composition was attained. Five such experiments with four (four experiments) or three (one experiment) microcosm cultures were run. Three experiments were performed with weak stirring which permitted sedimentary elimination of the diatoms. Two experiments were conducted with stronger stirring to prevent sedimentation. In the three "sedimentation intensive" experiments, the final phytoplankton community was composed of the filamentous chlorophyte Mougeotia thylespora together with a smaller biomass of nanoplanktic algae. In the two "sedimentation free" experiments the final phytoplankton community consisted of pennate diatoms. Both dissolved nutrient concentrations and the chemical composition of biomass suggested strong nutrient limitation of algal growth rates in the final phase of the experiments. The zooplankton communities at the end of the experiments were composed of species that were apparently unable to ingest the large, dominant algae and that presumably fed on the nanoplanktic "undergrowth" and the bacteria. There was a distinct sequence of events in all experiments: first, the large zooplankton species (Daphnia and Copepoda) were replaced by smaller ones (Chydorus, Bosmina, rotifers); second, all cultures within one experiment developed the same nutritional status (limitation by the same nutrient); and third, the taxonomic composition of phytoplankton of the different cultures within one experiment converged. The last took 7-9 weeks, with is about 2-3 times as long as the time needed in a phytoplankton competition experiment to reach the final outcome.																			0029-8549	1432-1939					1991	87	2					171	179		10.1007/BF00325254	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00325254								28313833					WOS:A1991FX12200003
J	Smith, LW				Smith, LW			The reproductive biology of an open-water spawning Lake Malawi cichlid, Copadichromis chrysonotus	AFRICAN ZOOLOGY												Copadichromis chrysonotus is a zooplanktivorous cichlid member of the diverse fish community inhabiting Lake Malawi's rocky, littoral habitat. Like most Lake Malawi cichlids, this species' reproductive strategy is based on maternal mouthbrooding, but it is the only littoral species known to spawn in the open water without a substrate-based territory. This study investigated length at maturity, sexual dimorphism, spawning behaviour, breeding seasonality, fecundity, fertility, egg size, and brooding habits of C, chrysonotus in southern Lake Malawi. Males in breeding colouration aggregated in sheltered areas at least several metres deep, and each male defended a mobile breeding territory near the surface while attempting to attract females. Breeding was mostly continuous from August to May, with peaks in August-September and January-March. A major lull in breeding activity occurred in May and June. Mean fecundity and fertility increased significantly with female total length, while mean egg length, mean egg mass and gonadosomatic index did not increase significantly with female total length. Females brooded their young up to 15-16 mm total length before abandoning them. Open-water spawning by C. chrysonotus may be an adaptation to reduce both egg predation during spawning and competition for substrate-based breeding territories.																			1562-7020					OCT	2000	35	2					151	164																WOS:000169907400001

The permanent waterlogged area of the lake is encircled by a vast floodplain, the inundated woodland being dominated by Barringtonia acutangula (Lecythidaceae), probably a major vegetation type of this ecotone, although human impact has degraded the floodplain vegetation and developed forest is restricted to a narrow band along the shore in the lowest water season. The aspects of seasonally inundated vegetation (i.e., variations in physiognomy, species composition, stratification, and distribution) on the coastal side of the floodplain (approximately 4 km in depth), located adjacent to the southern part of Siem Reap, was analyzed. Quantitative data for phytosociological evaluation were collected at 67 quadrats (10 m x 10 m each) during the low water seasons in 2005 and 2006, the sampling plots being classified by Two-Way Indicator Species Analysis (TWINSPAN) and ordinated by Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA). Two vegetation zones (i.e., extensive cropland and disturbed woodland), seven vegetation types (i.e., "Cultivated field," "Fallow field," "Shrub," and "Tall-shrub" in the extensive cropland zone and "Scrub," "Open forest," and "Closed forest" in the disturbed woodland zone), and vigorous invasion and/or regeneration of Barringtonia acutangula over the study area were identified. Human impact (e.g., plowing, burning, and cutting for firewood) seemed to be inversely related to both duration of flooding and maximum water depth and to be the main cause of degradation of seasonally inundated vegetation.

The concept of this model is based upon an individual's potential for growth and reproduction and for the change from parthenogenesis to gamogenesis, which was controlled by the life conditions of three consecutive generations of Daphnia. This was achieved by simulating the effects of temperature, food conditions and photoperiod experienced by grandmothers and mothers on an individual's potential for growth and reproduction. The model was used to test hypotheses on the significance of maternal transmission of information in population dynamics of Daphnia. The results supported several important conclusions, e.g. the corroboration of the importance of maternal effects for seasonal adaptations of crustaceans. The possibility of accumulation of maternal effects in successive generations apparently increases the resistance of the population to inter-annual fluctuations of environmental parameters. The model also confirms that maternal effects along with intra-population polymorphism are a mechanism providing stability of biological systems on the species (population) level.

During October-December, samples in the light trap comprised exclusively Tokunagayusurika akamusi (Tokunaga) and small numbers of one or two other species. T. akamusi, Procladuis (Holotanypus) culiciformis (L.), and Chironomus plumosus (L.) constituted 91.6 % of the annual catch of chironomid adults. The predominance of T. akamusi (7 5.3 % of chironomid catch) and the high ratio (13) of T. akamusi to C plumosus was more marked in this lake than other Japanese eutrophic lakes. Glyptotendipes tokunagai Sasa and Dicrotendipes pelochloris (Kieffer) were also caught abundantly with the light trap, but not with surface traps, indicating these were littoral species. The dry weight of emerging adults during May-December 1982 was 2.87 g m-2, of which 1.92 g m-2 (67 %) was T. akamusi and 0.67 g m-2 (23 %) C. plumosus and 0.23 g m-2 (8 %) Clinotanypus sugiyamai Tokunaga and 0.03 g m-2 (1 %) P. (H.) culiciformis. The weight of emerging Tanypodinae was much higher than the annual mean larval biomass or estimated larval production, which have been due to underestimating the population density using an Ekman-Birge dredge. High numbers of individuals and species of chironomids were caught during April-July, presumably as a result of the high food supply for chironomid communities.																			0018-8158					OCT 5	1992	245	1					27	40		10.1007/BF00008726	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008726													WOS:A1992KA38200003

Compared to Lake Francis, pupfish densities in Mirror Lake were higher, individuals were larger, and intraspecific aggression was more important than interspecific interactions with killifish. Killifish had little impact on the activity budgets of territorial male pupfish, but were excluded from favored breeding habitats. The opposite pattern was observed in Lake Francis. Killifish were numerically dominant as well as relatively larger than pupfish, and they interfered with the breeding activities of territorial males. In Lake Francis most of the agonistic activities of territorial male pupfish were directed toward killifish. Asymmetries in the interactions between pupfish and killifish in the two lakes also were reflected in qualitative and quantitative differences in the breeding activities of pupfish. In Mirror Lake the frequency of agonistic and breeding behaviors increased over the breeding season, but in Lake Francis they decreased. The underlying factors responsible for the observed competitive asymmetries between the species in the two habitats are not known. However, the higher salinity tolerances of pupfish may, in part, have accounted for both their numerical dominance and their size-advantage over killifish in the more saline environment of Mirror Lake. Physiological and ecological factors may thus play an important role in the outcome of competitive asymmetries between species.

Based on the 6-year study during five breeding seasons, we found 123 nests of Little Crake, but such an instance was observed only once. To the best of our knowledge, this observation is the first record of the use of the same nest by two species of rallids. We discuss what could force crakes to make such a decision, why this breeding attempt failed and why such instances are so rare in marsh-nesting species. The nest size in mid-field ponds localized in northern Poland was slightly smaller than that recorded in fishponds in the Czech Republic, but larger than the records obtained in lakes in Germany and Russia.					; Jedlikowski, Jan/ABB-7218-2021; Polak, Marcin/H-1614-2011	Jedlikowski, Jan/0000-0002-1320-7145; Polak, Marcin/0000-0002-2118-3294; 													1758-1559	1758-1567				NOV	2019	12	4					121	124		10.1177/1758155919844899	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1758155919844899													WOS:000486237000001
J	SMITH, AD; GILBERT, JJ				SMITH, AD; GILBERT, JJ			SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL VARIABILITY IN FILAMENT LENGTH OF A TOXIC CYANOBACTERIUM (ANABAENA-AFFINIS)	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. This study examines the distribution of Anabaena affinis filament lengths under natural conditions as a function of depth and season, and in the laboratory as a function of growth phase. Because Anabaena alines is only toxic when consumed, both its filament length and position in the water column are important determinants of its potential impact on zooplankton populations. 2. Star Lake (Norwich, Vermont, U.S.A.), a natural, eutrophic pond, remained thermally stratified throughout the Anabaena bloom. Filament number and length differed significantly with both sampling date and water depth. Most filaments occurred at 0.5 m, particularly at the height of the bloom. Throughout the entire water column average filament length decreased from approximately 0.53 mm in May to 0.14 mm in July. The shortest filaments occurred at the 2.5 m depth. Filament length distributions (combined for all depths) for 29 May, 12 June and 3 July, corresponding to the beginning, middle and end of the bloom, respectively, differed significantly among the three dates. These patterns most likely reflect variable growth conditions, both during the season and in the water column. 3. In the laboratory, Anabaena filament length was affected by medium composition and growth phase. Filaments were significantly longer when grown in MBL than in ASM medium. Also, the average length of Anabaena filaments grown in MBL changed significantly as cultures aged; by day 13 filament length (2.01 +/- 0.38 mm, mean +/- SD) was twice that on day 0 (0.97 +/- 0.71 mm). As cell concentration continued to increase, mean filament length gradually decreased.

J	Thompson, AB; Allison, EH; Ngatunga, BP				Thompson, AB; Allison, EH; Ngatunga, BP			Distribution and breeding biology of offshore cichlids in Lake Malawi/Niassa	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Lake Malaw/Niassa is the second largest rift valley lake in Africa, with an area of 28 800 km(2), and an average and maximum depth of 292 m and >700 m, respectively. The lake is well known for the great diversity of fish occurring in the inshore zone. However, the offshore fish community is poorly documented. To rectify this, regular sampling was undertaken over two years, using trawl and gillnets at six offshore locations. This paper reports on the species composition, spatial distribution and breeding biology of the dominant cichlids species from the offshore pelagic zone. Cichlids formed approximately 88% of the offshore fish biomass. Most abundant were two species of zooplanktivores in the genus Diplotaxodon that made up 71% of the offshore fish biomass. An undescribed species, given the cheironym D. 'bigeye', was mainly found at a depth of 220 m during the day, but moved into near surface waters at night when the moon was full. This species was absent from the shallow regions of the lake. The most abundant offshore species was D. limnothrissa, which was distributed evenly throughout the lake to depths of 220 m. A less common offshore zooplanktivore was Co-padichromis quadrimaculatus that formed 5 % of the biomass and was confined to the upper 100 m of the water column. The main piscivores were in the genus Rhamphochromis and formed approximately 10 % of the offshore fish biomass. The two dominant taxa were R. longiceps and the 'large Rhamphochromis' group, and both were more common in the southern half of the lake. The former occurred mainly in the upper 100 m of the water column and the latter mainly at depths of 100-150 m. The length at maturity and fecundity for the dominant offshore species were estimated and seasonal breeding cycles determined from gonad activity and gonado-somatic indices.

J	Loftin, CS; Rasberry, W; Kitchens, WM				Loftin, CS; Rasberry, W; Kitchens, WM			Development of a grid-cell topographic surface for Okefenokee Swamp, Georgia	WETLANDS												The Okefenokee Swamp is at 160,000 ha freshwater wetland in Southeast Georgia, USA that developed in a landscape basin. Hydrologic variability across the swamp suggests that water-surface elevations are not uniform across the swamp. The topographic surface map discussed herein was developed to describe the swamp topography at local to landscape scales and relate the swamp peat- and sand-surface elevations to elevation above mean sea level. These data were then used to relate water-surface elevations across the swamp so that the swamp hydrologic environment could be described spatially and temporally with a spatial hydrology model. The swamp was divided into 5 sub-basins that reflect similar seasonal hydrodynamics but also indicate local conditions unique to the basins. Topographic gradient influences water-level dynamics in the western swamp (2 sub-basins), which is dominated by the Suwannee River floodplain. The eastern swamp (3 sub-basins) is terraced, and the regional hydrology is driven less by topographic gradient and more by precipitation and evapotranspiration volumes. The relatively steep gradient and berm and lake features in the western swamp's Suwannee River floodplain limit the spatial extent of the Suwannee River sill's effects, whereas system sensitivities to evapotranspiration rates are more important drivers of hydrology in the eastern swamp.																			0277-5212	1943-6246				SEP	2000	20	3					487	499		10.1672/0277-5212(2000)020<0487:DOAGTS>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1672/0277-5212(2000)020<0487:DOAGTS>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000089532100007

The structures are produced by mats of coccoid cyanobacteria growing along the lakeshore from the water surface down to the O2-H2S interface located at a depth of 22.8 meters. Calcification of the mats is controlled by seasonal changes in calcium carbonate supersaturation in the epilimnion. The internally complex structures are a product of two different calcification processes: (i) periodic in vivo calcification of the surficial cyanobacterial layers by low-Mg calcite, and (ii) early postmortem calcification of the cyanobacterial aggregates below the mat surface by microbially precipitated aragonite. The finding supports the idea that Paleozoic stromatoporoids represent fossilized cyanobacteria (stromatolites). It also implies that the stromatoporpoid-generating epicontinental seas during the early Paleozoic may have been more alkaline and had a higher carbonate mineral supersaturation than modern seawater.

HYDROLOGY, NUTRIENT SOURCES AND PHYTOPLANKTON BIOMASS	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												A floodplain system of streams, [in Norfolk, England, UK] a main river (the R.Bure) and 10 man-made lakes (Broads) is described. The system is hypereutrophic and tidal. Retention times of water in the river and Broads have been estimated by dye-tracing (using rhodamine WT), flow and water level gauging, and chloride dilution following tidal surges. Retention times varied from < 1 day to > 8 weeks in different parts of the system. There was no correlation between measured retention time and mean phytoplankton chlorophyll a concentration. This was probably because mixing in even the most frequently flushed Broads was incomplete. Water retained in parts of them (nursery areas) for longer than the average retention time, so that algal crops, with which the river was inoculated, could build up. This also reduced the seasonal variability in size of standing crop, which was also uncorrelated with retention time. There was a very close linear relationship between mean growing-season chlorophyll a concentration and total phosphorus concentration (chlorophyll:P ratio = 0.56), suggesting that crop levels are set by phosphorus availability. N:P ratios in incoming water were very high. There was evidence that much phosphorus was lost to the sediments but that in only one area (South Walsham Broad) was internal loading of phosphorus from the sediment likely to be significant. Overall, the results ran counter to conventional widdom about the development of river phytoplankton.																			0142-7873	1464-3774				JUL	1989	11	4					813	838		10.1093/plankt/11.4.813	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/11.4.813													WOS:A1989AD91900012

Therefore, new approaches for this problem are needed. We describe electrochemically initiated transformation processes of iron and manganese, resulting in their immobilization in the sediment. This process could possibly be applied to prevent remobilization of phosphate from lake sediments. With electrodes positioned 3 cm in the sediment and 7 cm above the sediment-water interface, an electrochemically controlled redox- and pH-"barrier" was constructed. By means of laboratory experiments in columns filled with sediment and water from a reservoir, we demonstrated the possibility to fix and concentrate Fe and Mn under specific conditions in the sediment, or if required, to mobilize and drain them in concentrated solution. The behaviors of these metals were studied by simultaneous measurements of their concentrations, pH-, E-h-values, and O-2-concentration at the interface and in the water with and without current influence. The results show that soluble species can be transported and concentrated in an electric field. Iron and manganese can be prevented from being released from the sediments by sustainable in-situ fixation.					; Steinberg, Christian/O-8572-2019	Steinberg, Christian E.W./0000-0002-3132-8901; 													1015-1621					MAR	2004	66	1					95	102		10.1007/s00027-003-0649-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-003-0649-6													WOS:000220347700009

Temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, conductivity, transparency, nitrites, nitrates, total phosphorus, iron, hardness, turbidity, and suspended solids were quantified. Fourteen species of planktonic crustaceans were observed, including four copepods and ten cladocerans; major phytoplankton taxa were Chlorophyceae, Bacillariophyceae, Dinophyceae and Cyanobacteria. The first two reservoirs were dominated by cladoceran assemblages, and species of Chlorophyceae and Bacillariophyceae were common. In Cointzio, the downstream reservoir, a seasonal shift in dominance from copepods to cladocerans was observed and cyanobacteria blooms prevailed. Canonical correspondence analysis showed an environmental gradient from the two upstream reservoirs (with cold, transparent, softer waters) to the downstream reservoir (with highly turbid, more mineralized waters). Specific richness, diversity, and the speed of the shift in dominance from cladocerans to copepods between the dry and wet seasons all increased in line with the mineralization gradient.

Over the 3-yr study period (15 April 1992-15 April 1995), 3361 kite locations were obtained. Snail Rite habitats were classified as graminoid mash. cypress prairie, northern lake, miscellaneous peripheral (e.g., agricultural retention ponds), or Lake Okeechobee. Kites showed seasonal patterns in habitat use. Use of cypress prairies and miscellaneous peripheral habitats showed strong seasonal fluctuations with these areas used primarily during the nonbreeding season (July-December). Kite use of graminoid marshes and northern lakes fluctuated to a lesser extent and was highest during the breeding season (January-June). Use of Lake Okeechobee also fluctuated greatly but showed no obvious seasonal pattern. One potential reason for the high use of cypress prairies during the nonbreeding season was the kites' ability to perch hunt in these habitats, which may offer an energetic advantage over aerial hunting. Birds were less likely to breed in cypress prairies, however, due probably to their greater likelihood of drying down during the breeding season. Snail Kites without transmitters were more difficult to detect in cypress prairie and peripheral habitats due to limited access and dense vegetation. This seasonal use of habitats with lower detectability for kites ma!: have important implications for kite monitoring in Florida.																			0892-1016	2162-4569				JUN	1998	32	2					98	103																WOS:000074718600004

Crude protein level ranged from 26.3 to 45.5% of plant dry mass. The amino acid content of the plant compared favourably with that of blood, soybean and cottonseed meals and considerably exceeded that of groundnut meal. The levels of the essential amino acids surpassed the FAO reference pattern, except for methionine which met 61.4% of the recommended value. The levels of minerals were high but should not pose any toxicity problems if incorporated into animal feeds. The levels of nitrogen in the plant are comparable to those in commercial fertilizers. The plant could be a good dietary supplement and nutrient source for humans, livestock and fish and also could act as a good fertilizer suppplement. With an average standing crop of 309 kg dry mass (DM) ha-1 and doubling time of 1.2 days, 129 kg DM ha-1 of dry duckweed are obtainable daily in the Kainji Lake area, which could ensure a daily supply of 59 kg of high-quality protein for poultry and fish feed formulation. Manual harvesting and sun-drying are economically feasible in the dry season, especially during harmattan (December and January). In the rainy season, a cheap solar drier can be conveniently used for drying.																			0304-3770	1879-1522				JAN	1988	29	4					357	366		10.1016/0304-3770(88)90079-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(88)90079-4													WOS:A1988M262000006

It is concluded that the present taxonomic basis for species descriptions needs complete revision. The genus is idely distributed in southern Australian ephemeral and permanent salt lakes and is also known from central Australia and northern Queensland. Although an osmoconformer, active specimens have been recorded from lakes with salinities between 6 and 124 g l-1. With gradual acclimation, a population from Lake Tallinga, a South Australian ephemeral salt lake, had LD50 limits for salinity of 2 and 95.5 g l-1; with direct transfer these limits narrowed to 6 and 83 g l-1. Animals from the same locality were moderately tolerant to high temperatures, desiccation and low oxygen concentrations. The life-cycle seems to involve iteroparous, intermittent reproduction, with rather few resources devoted to reproduction. Survival over the unfavourable season (lake dry or too saline) is as adults. It seems that Coxiella survives in ephemeral salt lakes because its behaviour meliorates environmental extremes and because it has an ecological strategy which can successfully overcome the risk of life in such environments.																			0031-0182					MAY	1991	84	1-4					339	355		10.1016/0031-0182(91)90053-T	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0031-0182(91)90053-T													WOS:A1991FU23800022

This study was carried out in a fixed collection station located in the Riacho Fundo branch of the reservoir. Zooplankton samples were collected at intervals of 3-5 d at 9:00 a.m. during two months in the dry and rainy seasons for two years (dry-1996, rainy-1997, dry-1997 and rainy-1998), using a 64 mum-mesh plankton net. The most predominant species was Thermocyclops decipiens (about 50% of the total zooplankton community), which during the whole period had a high reproductive rate. The highest densities were found in the dry-1996 season (1700 ind/l for nauplii), and also fluctuated widely overtime. Nauplii stages dominated during the four periods, comprising 50-75% of the total population density. Ovigerous females peaked in the dry-1996 and rainy-1997 seasons, with 20-30% of the total females. The largest peak in egg production occurred during the dry-1996 season, and the total egg production was 2.0x10(3) eggs/l. Mesocyclops longisetus is a first record for Lake Paranoa. The ecological factors that determine the success of T. decipiens in eutrophic systems are related to omnivorous feeding habits and prey-predator interactions.

The population of Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) nesting in the North American Great Lakes has been increasing on average at 29% per annum in recent years, and there is an urgent need for reliable population estimates, in relation to this species' interactions with commercial and sport fisheries. We investigated within-season changes in numbers of apparently occupied nests (AONs) at 44 colony sites in lakes Superior and Huron, and at four colony sites in Lake Ontario. AON numbers increased significantly between the incubation and nesting stages (mean 22% for lakes Superior/Huron, and 74% for Lake Ontario). The magnitude of the increase in AON numbers between incubation and nestling periods was influenced most strongly by the earliness of the incubation stage census. Breeding was later at colony sites at higher latitudes, but there was little evidence of marked annual variation in chronology. Laying at recently formed colonies was later than at well-established ones. We suggest that more reliable population estimates for Double-crested Cormorant colonies, particularly in rapidly expanding populations, will be obtained if future censuses are made during the nestling stage, using our criteria for the census unit (AON).																			0738-6028						1995	18	2					179	192		10.2307/1521479	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1521479													WOS:A1995TN58800006

We related limnological variables to concentrations of contaminants, determined if sources of these contaminants existed in the lower 8 km of the river, and calculated loadings of materials to Saginaw Bay. Concentrations of most variables changed significantly among the six sampling dates in 1990-1991, while relatively few variables were different among the six sampling stations. Causes of changes in concentrations of variables in the river over time appeared to stem from two factors, seasonality and river discharge. One phase of the sampling program was conducted on six different dates which encompassed river flows ranging from greater than 700 m(3) sec(-1) to less than 25 m(3) sec(-1). The date an which the least river discharge was observed included a pow reversal when Saginaw Bay water intruded into the lower Saginaw River. Statistical analyses showed that temporal variation among variables was due, in part, to fluctuating river discharge and in part to seasonal factors. The relative importance of these two components varied among parameters. For example, total suspended solids were positively correlated with river discharge, while chlorophyll varied more seasonally. In contrast to temporal trends, few parameters varied significantly among the six sampling stations. This was especially true for dissolved and particulate metals. Loadings of key materials to Saginaw Bay from the Saginaw River were generally positively correlated with river discharge. We concluded that most substances entered the river upstream of our study section in the lower 8 km of the Saginaw River.					; Giesy, John/MXJ-7032-2025	Giesy, John/0000-0003-1931-9962; 													0380-1330						1995	21	1					17	34		10.1016/S0380-1330(95)71017-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(95)71017-6													WOS:A1995QQ63500003

A means of monitoring weevil populations has been developed using pitfall traps baited with ethanol and turpentine. The relative attractiveness of six combinations of ethanol and turpentine were compared. Traps were monitored throughout the 1988 and 1989 growing seasons in a Scots pine Christmas tree farm. Both species were more strongly attracted to ethanol/turpentine ratios above 1:1. Pales weevils preferred slightly higher ethanol/turpentine ratios than did pitch-eating weevils. Within species, both sexes responded equivalently among treatments. The implications of these behavioral responses to weevils' locating stressed trees, the role of chemical ecology in niche partitioning, and IPM of pine root weevils are discussed.																			0046-225X					FEB	1991	20	1					48	52		10.1093/ee/20.1.48	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/20.1.48													WOS:A1991EY04400008

Field enclosure experiments, designed to determine the intensity of intraspecific and interspecific competition at approximately natural densities, were conducted during Sept. 1981 and April 1982. Survival rate for both species was dependent on intraspecific density in Sept.; C. elisa was also affected by the presence of T. cynosura. These effects are attributed to interference (encounter) competition rather than to exploitation (consumption) competition. The mechanism of competition seems to be predation by larger larvae on smaller larvae. No evidence of either exploitation or interference competition was found in the April experiment.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1985	66	1					119	128		10.2307/1941312	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1941312													WOS:A1985ABS6200012

Species diversity increased after liming, but decreased after fish introduction. The dominant copepod, Eudiaptomus gracilis, was relatively unaffected by the manipulations. Several cladoceran species, and especially Diaphanosoma brachyurum, were positively influenced by liming. After fish introduction, first Bosmina longirostris and Ceriodaphnia quadrangula and, some years later, Daphnia longispina, became the dominant zooplankton. The changes in the crustacean community are discussed in relation to planktivore fauna. During the limed and fishless condition, high densities of phantom midge larvae (Chaoborus spp.) and waterboatmen (Corixidae) suppressed susceptible prey species. When these predators were reduced after fish introduction, the efficient herbivore D. longispina expanded and ultimately limited the abundance of other crustaceans. Thus, liming creates the potential for the development of a diverse fauna but the actual development of crustaceans in limed lakes is strongly influenced by predation and competition patterns.																			0003-9136					JUL	1994	131	1					1	23																WOS:A1994NZ83800001

Reproductive effort, which includes the energy cost of migration, is higher for cisco. Female cisco allocate more energy to reproduction than its total energy gain. The energy invested by lake whitefish in reproduction is approximately equal to its seasonal energy gain. Reproduction results in large differences in the energy content of gonads, viscera, and carcass between reproductive and nonreproductive fish of the same length. Neither cisco nor lake whitefish are able to spawn two years in succession. The somatic energy increase of reproductive female cisco is 121% lower than the somatic energy increase of nonreproductive females; similar comparisons are 89% (female) and 103% (male) for lake whitefish. The energy cost of migration is largely responsible for the highest somatic cost of reproduction observed for cisco. These different somatic costs of migration are related to resource accumulation prior to migration and to differences in the aerobic cost of swimming between the two species in combination with the difficultly of the freshwater migration.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				FEB	1990	47	2					318	334		10.1139/f90-033	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f90-033													WOS:A1990CN64400008

J	Naing, N; Santosa, HR; Soemarno, I				Naing, Naidah; Santosa, Happy Ratna; Soemarno, Ispurwono			Living on the Floating Houses for Sustainable Livelihoods at Lake Tempe, South Sulawesi	ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION ASIA												Living both inland and in floating houses are two aspects or life for the ethnic Buginese who dwell on the coast of Lake Tempe in South Sulawesi. Their primary occupations include fishing and farming, which resulted in the community's decision to build their traditional houses in the form of stilted houses inland and floating houses over water. The unique characteristics of Lake Tempe which has both flood tide and ebb tide every year, enable them to live in floating houses and work as fishermen during the flood tide and live inland, working as farmers during the ebb tide. The aim of this study was to determine how the ethnic Buginese use both their stilted houses and the floating houses as a means of adaptation in order to sustain their livelihoods. The study employed qualitative methods through the Ethno-Architecture approach, which was then analyzed using the Spradley Model. The study found that the upper spaces in the houses over the lake that are used for fishing serve an economic function to the fisherman in helping to improve their livelihoods. In addition to being a comfortable dwelling, the floating house is also used to store and process the fresh fish into dried fish. The use of the upper space is not only regulated by the local government's regulations, but also by customary law in order to maintain the harmony and sustainability of the relationship between humans and their environment. When the lake water recedes during dry season, the community settles inland and farms there around the lake, planting such crops as corns, beans and vegetables. Thus, living in the stilted houses inland and floating houses over the lake forms the community's process of adapting to the environmental condition present on the coast of Lake Tempe and a means by which to improve livelihoods.

The investigations took place every fortnight, using 4-methylumbelliferyl-phosphate (MUP) as substrate. Three size categories were measured; the dissolved fraction <0.2 mu m, 0.2 mu m < bacteria<1.0 mu m, and 1.0 mu m<mostly algae<150 mu m. Samples were incubated at their original temperature and at the natural pH. The maximum velocity (V-max) of the PA in all the fractions increased significantly with higher trophic levels. The kinetics of the fractions differed substantially. In all the lakes, the bacterial cell-bound phosphatases mainly had the lowest Michaelis-Menten constant (K-m) and relatively low V-max. A high V-max was only evident with bacterial cell-bound PA in the anoxic hypolimnion of the mesotrophic Brauhaussee. An extremely low substrate affinity, and a high V-max of algal cell-bound phosphatases were found in the oligotrophic lake Herrensee. The K-m and V-max of algal cell-bound PA varied with the successive algal maxima in all the lakes. Dissolved PA varied with the seasons. This mainly contributed more than 50% to the total PA in the oligotrophic lake.

Based on a case study of commercial whitefish fishery in Lake Femund, a mountain lake in southeastern Norway, this article outlines experience gained and indicates some of the general problems related to this type of economic activity, They concern aspects such as resource biology, product development and marketing, economic management, and staff recruitment. An initial hypothesis of the study was that commercial fishery would have a significant impact on the whitefish stock, causing fluctuations in yield and consequent variations in the economy of the fishery. Therefore, the study included an analysis of marketing possibilities for whitefish products, as well as of the social and socioeconomic conditions sustaining whitefish fishery in the local community. Nearly 20 years of data show that commercial fishery in Lake Femund, with a yield of up to I kg per ha, has a low to moderate exploitation rate. Thus, fishery itself does not generate fluctuations in the fish population that would influence yields. The major restrictions on the enterprise are related to other aspects, such as problems of economic and technical management of this specialized small-scale industry, difficulties in the recruitment of fishermen to a short-season fishery in a time when the employment pattern in the community is changing from seasonal activities in agriculture to full-time employment in manufacturing and services, and the challenge of developing and marketing competitive products for a niche market.

J	HANNA, M; PETERS, RH				HANNA, M; PETERS, RH			EFFECT OF SAMPLING PROTOCOL ON ESTIMATES OF PHOSPHORUS AND CHLOROPHYLL CONCENTRATIONS IN LAKES OF LOW TO MODERATE TROPHIC STATUS	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Methods of sampling lake phosphorus and chlorophyll concentrations were assessed by comparing mean values for 16 lake basins in southern Quebec. Integrating tube and discrete-depth samples were analyzed to yield six different subsurface, depth-integrated, and volume-weighted average values representing epilimnetic, euphotic, and trophogenic zones. The different protocols were found to be similarly precise. Epilimnetic samples yield low values, while trophogenic samples yield high ones; however, the differences in protocol accounted for less than 50%. Analysis of variance associated most of the uncertainty in these estimates with lake and sampling date and showed that sampling site rarely had a significant effect. Year had only a minor effect, but interannual variation is probably underestimated, since these data represent only two years. These patterns suggest that representative sampling for a given lake requires only a single sample per visit but several visits within a season. Since chlorophyll varied more spatially than phosphorus, sampling protocol affect its estimates to a greater extent. Phosphorus-chlorophyll regressions based on data collected in different ways were very similar, so differences in protocol and sampling depth seem unlikely to contribute to the high uncertainty in existing phosphorus response models.

J	El-Daoushy, F; Eriksson, MG				El-Daoushy, F; Eriksson, MG			Radiometric dating of recent lake sediments from a highly eroded area in semiarid Tanzania	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Semiarid regions are vulnerable environments with a series of important and often discussed problems such as land degradation, water scarcity and desertification. These regions are dynamic and respond quickly to climatic and environmental changes. Unlike lakes in temperate zones, lakes in semiarid regions are yet poorly utilized as climatic and environmental indicators. In this study aquatic deposits are used to uncover the environmental history of a severely degraded area in central Tanzania. The Pb-210 and Cs-137 chronologies date a 360 cm long sediment sequence to 155 years. The sediments show that lake Haubi basin changed from a seasonally waterlogged depression to a lake at the turn of the century. Calculated sedimentation rates show that the catchment of the lake has been subject to varied and enhanced soil erosion during the last 155 years.																			0921-2728					MAY	1998	19	4					377	384		10.1023/A:1007986402639	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1007986402639													WOS:000074959600001
J	HINO, S				HINO, S			FLUCTUATION OF ALGAL ALKALINE-PHOSPHATASE ACTIVITY AND THE POSSIBLE MECHANISMS OF HYDROLYSIS OF DISSOLVED ORGANIC PHOSPHORUS IN LAKE BARATO	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Fluctuation of algal alkaline phosphatase activity, and the possible mechanisms of hydrolysis of dissolved organic phosphorus by alkaline phosphatases that could be isolated from algae, were investigated seasonally at Lake Barato. The fluctuation of specific enzymatic activity was affected by algal species rather than by the concentration of external phoshorus and amount of phytoplankton. Most (more than 74%) of the organic phosphorus, extracted from phytoplankton, was hydrolyzed by the three variants of alkaline phosphatase purified from Melosira spp., Anabaena sp., and Escherichia coli. By contrast, the organic phosporus in lake water and that extracted from sediment muds were only partially hydrolyzed (up to 32% and 20%, respectively) by the same enzymes. These results indicate that phytoplankton cannot utilize most of the dissolved organic phosphorus in the lake water and in the sediment muds through enzymatic hydrolysis by alkaline phosphatase, in spite of the high levels of activity of this enzyme in the organisms.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN 8	1988	157	1					77	84		10.1007/BF00008812	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008812													WOS:A1988L756300009
J	SHIELDS, WM				SHIELDS, WM			BARN SWALLOW MOBBING - SELF-DEFENCE, COLLATERAL KIN DEFENSE, GROUP DEFENSE, OR PARENTAL CARE	ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR												Stimuli (human and stuffed owl) were presented to a marked population of barn swallows (H. rustica) during the 1980-1982 breeding seasons at the Cranberry Lake Biological Station, Saint Lawrence County, New York [USA]. In experiment 1, the stimuli were presented at various distances from active nests during various stages of the reproductive cycle. Both the probability and intensity of mobbing varied during the breeding season, increasing with the probable reproductive value of young of the year and the degree of danger posed to them. Mobbing group sizes varied positively with local nest densities. In experiment 2, mobbing group structure was analyzed in greater detail. Barn swallow mobbing groups usually contained active mobbers (those that emitted mobbing calls, and approached the stimulus closely, < 2 m, or even hit it) and passive mobbers (which were silent and flew in circles at greater distances, 2-10 m, from the stimulus). Passive mobbers were a random sample of the local population with respect to sex, age, nest location and reproductive status. This pattern is consistent with a hypothesis that passive mobbing, the less risky type, is a form of self-defense that reduces an actor''s chance of being eaten, probably by providing information about the identity or probable behavior of potential predators. Active mobbers were not a random sample of the source population. Mated birds and especially parents with nestlings were over-represented; non-breeders, juveniles and incubators rarely mobbed actively. The seasonal changes in mobbing and the identity of active and passive mobbers are inconsistent with hypotheses that mobbing is a form of cooperative group defense or altruism conditioned by reciprocity or kin or group selection. The data are consistent with other hypotheses which propose that mobbing benefits the mate or the young. Even though active mobbers may be at risk, they benefit directly by increasing the personal component of their inclusive fitness, probably by alerting mates and young and defending them from predators. In this light the behavioral complex of mobbing appears to be a form of parental care (active) as well as self-defense (passive) and mate defense (active).																			0003-3472	1095-8282					1984	32	FEB					132	148		10.1016/S0003-3472(84)80331-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0003-3472(84)80331-0													WOS:A1984SE55500014
J	Grimshaw, HJ				Grimshaw, HJ			Nutrient release and detritus production by herbicide-treated freely floating aquatic vegetation in a large, shallow subtropical lake and river	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The areal extent of freely floating aquatic vegetation (FFAV), treated annually with herbicides in Lake Okeechobee and the Kissimmee River, was compiled, and preliminary estimates were made of the amounts of detritus produced and total nitrogen (N) and total phosphorus (P) released. On average, over the 24-yr period of record for Lake Okeechobee from 1975 through 1998, 14,281 +/- 1,544 metric tons (m.t.) of detritus was produced, and 285 +/- 31 m.t. of N and 74 +/- 8 m.t. of P were returned to the water column. Nutrients released in the lake by treated FFAV were estimated to have a molar N to P ratio of 9: 1, and to have ranged minimally from 1 to 17 percent and from 4 to 49 percent of its external annual N and P loads, respectively. In Lake Okeechobee, treated FFAV was heterogeneously distributed, and occurred primarily in the southern and western near-shore regions. Fisheating Bay received the largest amount of this treated material. Treatable FFAV was positively correlated with lake stage. In the Kissimmee River, Lake Okeechobee's main inflow, on average, over its 16-yr period of record from 1983 through 1998, 4,427 +/- 593 m.t. of detritus was produced, and 88 +/- 12 m.t. of N and 23 +/- 3 m.t. of P were returned to the water column. Some of these nutrients and detritus likely reach Lake Okeechobee and contribute to its external N, P and detrital loads. Treated FFAV has substantially increased the amount of, and temporally and spatially altered, both detritus production in, and the internal N and P loading to, both Lake Okeechobee and the Kissimmee River. These nutrient and detrital additions only further exacerbate the already ongoing processes of cultural eutrophication within these waterbodies.																			0003-9136					FEB	2002	153	3					469	490																WOS:000174384600007

Metabolic responses to season and temperature were studied in whole animals, tissues and selected enzymes. The exponent of the relationship between body mass and three levels of the metabolic rate of acclimated fish was 0.82 +/- 0.02, 0.60 +/- 0.15, and 0.75 +/- 0.01 at 4, 12, and 20-degrees-C respectively. Various combinations of long-term acclimation to constant or seasonally fluctuating temperatures and long-term (up to 14 days) monitoring of VO2 at the acclimation temperature led to the conclusion that the aerobic power of fish swimming in the routine mode does not show any sign of being temperature compensated. On the other hand, there are several indications that the energy expenditure of spontaneously swimming fish is adjusted to the seasonal pattern of environmental change and that these responses of metabolism and behaviour are controlled by both endogenous and exogenous factors. The rate of oxygen consumption of gill and muscle tissue 'brei' from fish caught during a seasonal cycle and measured at 15-degrees-C appears to follow closely the reproductive and gonadal cycle of the living fish. The same holds for the activities of phosphofructokinase, acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase, and cytochrome oxidase. On the other hand, the Na+, K+-ATPase of the kidney shows near perfect temperature compensation when fish acclimated to 5 and 25-degrees-C are compared, whereas an equally pronounced case of inverse temperature acclimation has been reported for the activity of digestive enzymes in the gut. Summarizing these data it is pointed out that the temperature relationship of a poikilothermic organism is the sum of often very diverse temperature relationships of specific metabolic and behavioural functions. In the case of the roach, strong effects of acclimation temperature on the molecular level, sometimes in the opposite direction, combine with seasonal effects on enzyme activities and tissue respiration. However, on the whole animal level the fish behave as strictly non-compensating poikilotherms, the reproductive cycle being the only detectable influence capable of modulating the basic temperature relationship of energy expenditure.																			0378-1909					JAN	1992	33	1-2					73	85		10.1007/BF00002555	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00002555													WOS:A1992HA38100008

An anthrax outbreak killed more than 90% of the impala population, and rinderpest some 20% of the number of buffalo. The two epidemics showed different patterns: anthrax continued for nearly a year, while the rinderpest outbreak lasted a few weeks only. However, both started at the end of the dry season, and in the discussion attention is given to the ecological conditions leading to the outbreak of disease. We conclude that epidemics in this Park had a more severe impact on the study populations than predation had, and we suggest that diseases are very important agents of natural selection. This means that in the study of ecology more attention should be given to disease and also that small nature reserves can depauperate easily if recolonization is prevented.

A total of 906 fish specimens belonging to 6 fish species (Aphanius danfordii, Neogobius melanostamus, Proterorhinus marmoratus, Gasterosteus aculeatus, Platichthys flesus and Chelon auratus) were examined monthly during a period of one year. Four digenean species recorded as encysted metacercariae were identified; these were three species belonging to Heterophyidae, i.e. Ascocotyle coleostoma, Pygidiopsis genata and Cryptocotyle concava, and one species of the family Diplostomatidae, i.e. Posthodiplostomum sp. Ascocotyle coleostoma was found to be the dominant species and detected in all examined fish species. Posthodiplostomum sp. was detected only in A. danfordii. Cryptocotyle concava was detected in N. melanostamus and P. marmoratus. Infection prevalence and intensity were calculated and discussed for each digenean species recorded as metacercariae in relation to season. The eye, heart and gill tissues of infected fish with parasites were examined histologically. The histological evaluation indicated that the histological lesions were more severe in gills.

Using ANOVA we determined the statistical significance of seasonal changes in number and ratio of nauplius larvae, copepodid larvae, and adults. The method of sampling reduction was used to identify the three phases of population cycle: growth, peak, and depression of number, corresponding to three biological seasons.

Our primary objectives were to determine when West Nile virus (WNV, Flaviviridae, Flavivirus.) arrived at the site and if survivorship changed after this arrival. We monitored viral activity by screening blood samples from House Finches for WNV antibodies with an enzyme immunoassay and by testing mosquito pools for viral RNA. WNV arrived after the breeding season in late 2004, so we compared data from 2001-2004 (pre-WNV) to that from 2005-2008 (post-WNV). We found a decrease in annual survival following the arrival of WNV (pre-WNV, 0.59; post WNV, 0.47), which, if representative, may have contributed to the reported decline in the abundance of this species in northern California.

Minor concentrations of hydrated ferric oxides occur in the suspended particulate matter. Pyrite is formed within the sediments by the reaction of sulfide ion with clay-bound ferric ions. The large volume of seasonally anoxic water and strong formation of pyrite in the sediments serve to efficiently remove poorly crystalline hydrated ferric oxides from the water column. The concentrations of hydrated ferric oxides in the water are insignificant relative to those of phosphorus; consequently, most of the internally regenerated inorganic phosphorus is readily available for algal growth. Amisk Lake is probably naturally eutrophic.																			0008-4476	1499-1276				JUN	1994	32		2				459	468																WOS:A1994NX34900022

The colony at Hamilton Harbour is one of five Lake Ontario colonies, but its present location within the harbor is threatened by development plans. In an effort to determine the feasibility of relocating Caspian Terns, a raft was built and installed as an alternative nesting site during the 1993-1995 breeding seasons. In 1993, one pair established a nest and raised two chicks to at least 25 days, in 1994, six pairs nested and six chicks fledged and in 1995, 50 pairs nested and raised 97 chicks to fledging. In 1993, colonization of the raft by one pair occurred within 11 days of removal of a tarpaulin put in place to discourage nesting by gulls. In 1994, the raft was not colonized until late in the breeding season, some 42 days after it became available. Factors influencing the late nesting in 1994 are unclear, but may relate to either a renesting of failed pairs from mainland sites, or a loss of habitat in the mainland sub-colonies due to encroachment by Ring-billed Gulls (Larus delawarensis) and increasing vegetation. In 1995, the raft was colonized by 8 May and at least 50 pairs nested, raising approximately two young per nest. Heavy predation by red fox (Vulpes vulpes) on mainland sub-colonies resulted in the raft providing the majority of fledged young in 1995.																			0738-6028						1996	19	1					135	138		10.2307/1521819	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1521819													WOS:A1996VK49600018

Alligators greater than or equal to 122 cm were captured during 5- to 12-day periods on Orange Lake and Lake Woodruff National Wildlife Refuge, Florida, and marked with paint on the dorsal neck area. Replicate helicopter surveys were subsequently flown on each area to record marked and unmarked individuals. Population estimates were calculated and compared with night-light and aerial counts of alligators greater than or equal to 122 cm. Estimated mean proportion of alligators greater than or equal to 122 cm sighted during May-June night-light surveys was 0.189 for Orange Lake and 0.090 for Lake Woodruff NWR. Mean sighting proportions during May aerial surveys were 0.106 for Orange Lake and 0.172 for Lake Woodruff NWR. Night-light and aerial alligator counts can be corrected for Visibility bias to estimate population size, but sighting proportions may vary depending on habitat type, environmental conditions, and season.																									1996							509	519																WOS:000073965500055

A mathematical model was developed to describe Se transformations and transport in Tulare Lake Drainage District's pilot flow-through wetland cells in California having. dimensions of 15 in width and 76, in length. In the model, the wetland cell is subdivided into five subcells and each subcell consists of 10 internal compartments. and Se can be transferred between the compartments by physical and chemical processes. Physical processes include water movement, plant litter drop, and physical material breakdown. Chemical processes include Se reduction from selenate(SeVI) to selenite (SeIV), and further reduction to elemental selenium (Se0) and organic Se (Se-II). In the, chemical processes, the Se transformation reaction was assumed to obey first-order kinetics and the Arrhenius equation for temperature dependency. A total of 33 ordinary differential equations were written to,describe all the processes within and between the internal compartments. A Fortran program with a numeric subroutine using the fourth order Runge-Kutta method followed by the four-step Adams-Bashforth-Moulton predictor-corrector method was written to solve the equations simultaneously. The daily rate model, was successfully calibrated with data from a test. plot planted to Smooth cordgrass and validated with data from test plots planted to Rabbitsfoot grass, Saltgrass, and Cattail. This model provided seasonal variations in Se mass distribution and Se speciation in different compartments by considering,seasonal changes in water temperature, Se volatilization rate, and evapotranspiration. Sensitivity analyses on physical parameters such as water inflow rate, water depth, or longitudinal length of a wetland showed that decreasing the inflow rate or increasing the water depth or increasing the longitudinal length of a wetland cell can increase the accumulation of Se in compartments of a wetland cell and reduce the total mass of Se in the outflow water. Such information will be useful for developing engineering design criteria for constructed flow-through wetlands.

J	Håkanson, L; Boulion, VV				Håkanson, L; Boulion, VV			Modelling production and biomasses of prey and predatory fish in lakes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												This work presents a new dynamic model to predict two fundamental functional categories of fish in lakes, prey and predatory fish. The model has been developed within the framework of a more comprehensive lake ecosystem model, LakeWeb, which also accounts for phytoplankton, bacterioplankton, two types of zooplankton ( herbivorous and predatory), zoobenthos, macrophytes and benthic algae. The new fish model gives seasonal variations ( the calculation time is 1 week). It is meant to account for all factors regulating the production of fish for lakes in general. The model has not been calibrated and tested in the traditional way using data from a few well investigated lakes. Instead, it has been tested using empirical data and regressions based on data from many lakes. The basic aim of the model is that it should capture typical functional and structural patterns in many lakes. It accounts in a relatively simple manner for many complicated processes, like fishing ( by birds, animals and man), fish migration to and from lakes and how macrophyte cover gives shelter to small fish and reduces predation pressure. Food choices are handled by distribution coefficients regulating how much of the different available food sources a given organism would consume. Beside these distribution coefficients, and the way the food choices are structured ( the food choice panel), fundamental concepts in the fish model are: ( 1) metabolic efficiency ratios, which express how much of the food consumed by the predator that will increase the biomass of the predator and how much that will be lost by respiration and faeces, ( 2) actual consumption rates, which are defined from the ratio between the actual biomass of the predator and the normal biomass of the predator, and the normal consumption rates, which are related to the turnover time of the predator. We have demonstrated that the new model gives predictions which agree well with the values given by the empirical regressions, and also expected and requested divergences from these regression lines when they do not provide sufficient resolution.

J	Rupf, I; Radons, G				Rupf, I; Radons, G			New approaches for automated data processing of annually laminated sediments	NONLINEAR PROCESSES IN GEOPHYSICS												Laminated sediments, like evaporites and biogenic lake sediments, provide high-resolution paleo-climate records. Yet detection and counting of laminae causes still problem; because sedimentary structures are often disturbed. In the past laminated rocks often were analysed manually a tedious and subjective work. The present study describes four automated approaches for lamina detection based on 1 d grey-scale vectors. Best results are obtained with a newly developed algorithm, called Adaptive. Template Method (ATM) in combination with the Hilbert transform. ATM improves the signal to noise ratio of the grey-value signal. Its basic idea is to extract first a characteristic waveform, the template, which describes the typical grey-value variation transverse to the laminae. This is a kind of "template learning" process, which in practice is done by an appropriate averaging method. This template is in a second step used for processing the whole sample. One calculates the overlap of the template with the actual signal, the grey-value variation along the core, as function of position in core direction. This method generates a new signal with maxima at positions, where the template optimally matches the original signal. The new time-series is called AT-transform. It is smoother than the initial data sequence. High frequency noise and local trend effects are suppressed. Afterwards, the AT-transform can be analysed with the Hilbert transformation for extracting phase information. The data processing methods are tested both on artificial data sequences and on a seasonally laminated sedimentary record of the Oligocene Baruth Maar (Germany). Although ATM is no panacea for highly disturbed signals, our comparison with other approaches shows that it provides the best results. The combination of ATM and the Hilbert transform allows to detect clearly long-term oscillations in the sedimentation patterns and thus cycles in climatic variations.

J	GUNATILAKA, A				GUNATILAKA, A			DOLOMITE FORMATION IN COASTAL AL-KHIRAN, KUWAIT ARABIAN GULF - A REEXAMINATION OF THE SABKHA MODEL	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												Recent dolomites are found in the subtidal, intertidal and supratidal sediments of the lagoons and sabkhas of coastal Al-Khiran, Kuwait. Two stages of diagenetic dolomite formation have been recognised in the sabkhas; one formed during the earlier lagoonal (transgressive) phase and the other during the later sabkha phase after progradation has commenced. In Al-Khiran, dolomite forms under geochemical conditions within the following ranges: (a) a Mg2+/Ca2+ molar ratio of 5.3 to 6.1 (in the lagoons) and 3.6 to 14 (in sabkhas); (b) reduced levels of dissolved SO4(2-) concentration, either through microbial sulphate reduction and/or achievement of seasonal mild schizohaline conditions (as in the lagoons) or by minor gypsum precipitation within the sediments; (c) a reducing environment in association with diagenetic pyrite formation; (d) a chloride concentration between 0.62 mol Cl- kg-1 (in lagoons) and 2.15-2.95 mol Cl- kg-1 (in sabkhas); (e) temperatures between 12-degrees-C and 35-degrees-C, and a pH between 6.4 and 8.4. In those areas of present-day optimum dolomite formation in the sabkha, the near-surface groundwater brines (the potential "dolomitizing" fluid) do not show major changes in chemical composition with time. The question of the dominant mechanism of dolomite formation (i.e. primary precipitation versus diagenetic alteration of host aragonite) is left open, but the balance of evidence (chemical and petrographic) favours a primary origin. Due to the coastal configuration and topographic barriers in the form of chenier ridges, marine flood recharge of the sabkhas and flooding frequencies (which control flow rates) are curtailed. The highest dolomite percentage is confined to intertidal channel areas, and in the absence of an efficient hydrodynamic flow mechanism, the volume of dolomite formed in the sabkha remains low (4 to 10% on average). Away from these areas, the intensity of dolomitization is reduced, even though the porosity and permeability of the host sediments are favourable. This occurrence is rather different from other well known areas of dolomite formation, as in the Caribbean and the southern Arabian Gulf (where the dolomite content is an order of magnitude greater), despite a similar host sediment stratigraphy and mineralogy. In Al-Khiran, it has not been possible to demonstrate a quantitative relationship between the dolomite content in the sediments and solution chemistry variables. It is surmised that the physical setting of the area, not solution chemistry, may be the major control on how much dolomite forms in the sabkha.																			0037-0738					JUN	1991	72	1-2					35	53		10.1016/0037-0738(91)90122-T	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0037-0738(91)90122-T													WOS:A1991FZ17500002
J	An, KG; Park, SS				An, KG; Park, SS			In situ experimental evidence of phosphorus limitation on algal growth in a lake ecosystem	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND HEALTH PART A-TOXIC/HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES & ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												This paper presents the results of in situ Nutrient Stimulation Experiments (NSEs) demonstrating that phosphorus was the primary nutrient controlling algal growth in the Taechung Reservoir, Korea. Algal response in most treatments with only nitrogen added was less than or the same as in the controls, whereas the growth in treatments enriched with phosphorus increased by as much as fivefold. Phosphorus limitation was consistent over the experimental period when bioassay experiments were conducted, but the magnitude of growth response to phosphorus enrichments varied with the season. Algal yield in P-treatments was maximum when thermal stratification was strong and total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) was near the level of depletion. Regression analyses of NSEs showed that in situ algal response in P treatments, measured as log-transformed CHLf:CHLi ratios, declined (R-2 = 0.995, p < 0.001) with ambient concentrations of log-transformed TDP. Also, algal response in the P treatments showed a first-order linear fit (R-2 = 0.961, p < 0.001) with log-transformed DIN (dissolved inorganic nitrogen): TDP ratios. These outcomes indicate that the magnitude of in situ algal response increased with lower levels of P and higher dissolved N:P ratios in the ambient lake water. Our experimental approach employing NSEs suggests that abatement of phosphorus from the watershed seems to be an efficient management strategy to control the eutrophication of this system.

In the method 1, using the difference between 37-GHz data of water surface and of the ambient land, stable values for three years in the rainy season are obtained. The difference between 37-GHz Vpol values and that of 37-GHz Hpol fluctuates slightly. Although we could not obtain the truth data due to cloud cover over the area in the rainy season, data obtained from NOAA/AVHRR and ETOPO5 elevation provide a means to evaluate the result from the SSM/I data.

A comparison was also made among the characteristics of NOM from this and two other lakes. The study showed that NOM in Lake Kasumigaura had comparable DOC, UVA(260), and THMFP with that of Lake Inbanuma, but much higher than that of Lake Tsukui. Both molecular weight and polydispersities remained similar among those three sources but these values were significantly smaller in comparison with Suwannee River NOM. The similarity, index analysis based on pyrochromatograms was useful to evaluate spatial and seasonal changes in NOM characteristics. Distinctive characteristics of NOM at KS1 (station near the mouth of Sakura River) were better explained by the difference in pyrochromatograms rather than in general water quality. Except for KS1, the change in NOM characteristics in the lake water was found to be more pronounced in different seasons than at different locations.

J	PELEGRI, JL; RICHMAN, JG				PELEGRI, JL; RICHMAN, JG			ON THE ROLE OF SHEAR MIXING DURING TRANSIENT COASTAL UPWELLING	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												A two-dimensional two-layer model for wind-driven transient coastal upwelling is formulated. The momentum equations include the turbulent dynamics and the time-dependent and nonlinear terms in both the cross- and along-shore directions. The continuity and heat equations allow mass and heat turbulent transfer between both layers. The integral form of the momentum, continuity and heat equations are closed using a two-regime parameterization for the entrainment velocity. In the first regime, corresponding to the early stages of upwelling, the interface quickly raises due to Bur divergence near the coast. The entrainment velocity is small (0.1-1 m day(-1)), largely produced through KRAUS and TURNER'S [(1967) Tellus, 19, 98-106] slow erosion of the thermocline. and it is estimated using NILLER and KRAUS' [(1977) In: Modelling and prediction of the upper layers of the ocean, Pergamon Press, Oxford, pp.143-172] parameterization. When the bulk Richardson number (Ri) becomes close to its critical value then we switch to the second regime, during which we calculate the entrainment velocity from the continuity equation under the condition that Ri remains near-critical, i.e. the equivalent of POLLARD et al. [(1973) Geophysical Fluid Dynamics, 4, 381-404] stability criterion for the upper ocean. The entrainment velocity quickly becomes large (several m h-l), the interface deepens and stratification is eroded. The existence of this regime is supported by observations of persistent near-critical gradient Richardson numbers (Ri(g)) during coastal upwelling [JOHNSON (1981) In: Coastal upwelling, American Geophysical Union, Washington, DC., pp. 79-86; JOHNSON et al. (1976) Journal of Physical Oceanography, 6, 556-574; KUNDU and BEARDSLEY, (1991) Journal of Geophysical Research, 96, 4855-4868]. Our model is applied to several initial temperature differences between the surface and bottom layers, with the upper layer depth and forcing parameters realistically chosen. The dynamically important mixing regime corresponds to the second regime, with effective shear-induced mixing being produced through a strong baroclinic coastal jet. A realistic front, formed between the well-mixed water near the coast and lighter offshore surface water, propagates away from the coast. The offshore waters are characterized by the presence of inertial oscillations, overlying the Ekman flow. The inertial oscillations are too weak to produce any significant mixing, but a comparison with DESZOEKE and RICHMAN'S [(1984) Journal of Physical Oceanagraphy, 14, 364-377] semigeostrophic model (modified to include the shear-mixing regime) shows that they are important enough to exert some control on the horizontal volume flux divergence near the coast. A relatively fast internal Poincare wave, propagating from the coast, has the effect of slowly dampening the inertial oscillations. The results are in good qualitative agreement with early observations by JOHNSON et al. (1976).

Towards integrated management of a shallow tropical lake: assessment of water quality, sediment geochemistry, and phytoplankton diversity in Lake Palakpakin, Philippines	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The limited carrying capacities of shallow tropical lakes render them more vulnerable to ecological problems like eutrophication. Unregulated human activities such as unsustainable aquaculture and urbanization can alter ecosystem dynamics rapidly, and this warrants more comprehensive researches than what has been previously conducted. Here, we presented an integrated assessment of the nutrient dynamics, phytoplankton diversity, and sediment geochemistry in Lake Palakpakin, a shallow tropical lake of volcanic origin, to understand its deteriorating ecological state. Water, phytoplankton, and sediment samples were collected, and in situ water quality measurements were done during wet and dry seasons in four critical areas in the lake, namely, the inlet, center, sanctuary, and outlet. Results revealed that high light extinction coefficient (1.13m(-1)), high turbidity (28NTU), high phosphate concentration (>2.0.5mg/L), and the abundance of Microcystis aeruginosa, Anabaena helicoidea, and Lyngbya sp. indicate that from a relatively healthy lake in 2008, Lake Palakpakin has become a eutrophic to hypereutrophic freshwater body. High concentrations of available nutrients such as N and P were detected in the center and sanctuary sediments, which drive the internal nutrient loading in the lake. We recommend that management efforts be directed towards a whole-ecosystem approach in addressing the problem of eutrophication, especially in shallow tropical lakes.

Surface flux and vertical profile of dimethyl sulfide in acid sulfate soils at Cudgen Lake, northern New South Wales, Australia	CHEMOSPHERE												A dimethyl sulfide (DMS) vertical concentration profile and DMS surface emission flux were quantified in undisturbed acid sulfate soils (ASS) at Cudgen Lake on the north coast of New South Wales, Australia. A deuterated internal standard was used to account for soil adsorption characteristics. The DMS vertical concentration profile increased exponentially from 0.6 m depth to the surface layer. This profile reflected the adsorption properties of the ASS horizons present and the experimentally determined octanol/water partition coefficient for DMS of 136, suggesting that DMS would be mobilised in the soil water medium for upward translocation in time due to surface evaporation. The organic material in the oxidised ASS crustal layer had a chemically strong adsorption affinity for DMS, which appeared to restrain its emission from surface soil particles to the atmosphere. The seasonally averaged DMS surface flux estimate from the Cudgen lake ASS was 9 ngS m(-2) min(-1), which is relatively low by comparison to DMS fluxes reported from other wetland soils such as salt-marshes and acidic peat bogs. The worldwide annual average DMS emission from ASS was estimated to be 1.14 x 10(-3) Tg S, which is globally insignificant by comparison to DMS emission from the world's oceans.

J	Ferreira, GS; dos Santos, DAA; Lopes, EV				Ferreira, Giulianne Sampaio; Almeida dos Santos, Danilo Augusto; Lopes, Edson Varga			Richness, abundance and microhabitat use by Ardeidae (Ayes: Pelecaniformes) during one seasonal cycle in the floodplain lakesof the lower Amazon River	ZOOLOGIA												The Amazon floodplains become periodically submerged as result of seasonal changes in the water levels throughout the year. These changes influence the availability of microhabitats and consequently the abundance of organisms in these ecosystems. In this study we investigated 1) how changes in the water level affect the richness and abundance of ardeid birds in the lowland floodplain lakes of the lower Amazon River, and 2) the microhabitats used by these birds throughout the seasonal cycle. Ten lakes were surveyed at each of the four phases of the seasonal cycle. In total, 3,280 individuals of 11 species were recorded. Of these, eight species occurred in the four phases, and three were observed in one or two phases. In the analysis including the entire family, there were more individuals in the phase with waters at lowest level and less in the phase that the water level was lowering. Many species were present throughout the seasonal cycle, suggesting that they might be resident species. However, their abundance varied throughut the cycle, suggesting that parts of their populations temporarily migrate elsewhere. The microhabitat that was most commonly used by most species at all phases of the seasonal cycle, with the excetions noted below, was "aquatic macrophytes", suggesting that ardeid birds have a strong preperence for this kind of habitat. Three species - Egretta caerulea (Linnaeus, 1758), Nycticorax nyctkorax (Linnaeus, 1758) and Bubukus ibis (Linnaeus, 1758) - preferred other microhabitats at some phase of their seasonal cycle. The present study shows that the floodplain lakes of the lower Amazon River are richer in ardeid bird species than other areas of the Amazon biome and other biomes in Brazil. The fact that we found rare species in our study and that they depend on aquatic macrophytes demonstrates the importance of conserving the floodplain lakes of the lower Amazon River.																			1984-4689					JUL 31	2019	36								e30475	10.3897/zoologia.36.e30475	http://dx.doi.org/10.3897/zoologia.36.e30475													WOS:000478062900001

The spatial and temporal variation in abundance of some numerically dominant crustaceans, Mesocyclops aequatorialis similis (Copepoda), Thermocyclops consimilis (Copepoda) and Diaphanosoma excisum (Cladocera) is discussed. Temporal (months, sampling dates) rather than spatial (station) variability accounts for more than 50% of the total variance in zooplankton abundance but horizontal patchiness exists during periods of high zooplankton density. Sampling errors were generally low, except for counts of cyclopoid nauplii (subsampling) and Diaphanosoma (inter-replicate variance). Zooplankton showed distinct seasonality associated with the mixing cycle of the lake. Total numbers increased to more than 200 000 m-3 during the unstratified period (July to September). Low numbers were evident during stratification (February to May) when zooplankton numbers did not exceed 15 000 m-3. Individual zooplankton species and age classes showed variable seasonal amplitudes, ranging from 6.4 (nauplius 3) to 44.8 (copepodite 3 of Mesocyclops). We discuss some possible causes for zooplankton seasonality in Lake Awasa, and also review zooplankton seasonal cycles in other tropical lakes, especially African ones.																			0018-8158					NOV 22	1991	226	3					137	152		10.1007/BF00006856	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00006856													WOS:A1991GX60400002

This study was applied for six breeding waterbird species: Great-crested Grebe (Podiceps cristatus), Little Grebe (Tachybaptus ruficollis), Moorhen (Gallinula chloropus), Coot (Fulica atra), Water Rail (Rallus aquaticus) and Whiskered Tern (Chlidonias hybrida). A total of 205 nest-sites were studied in terms of five environmental factors: vegetation density and height, water depth, distance to open water, as well as distance to the nearest nest of the conspecific species were measured. Great-crested Grebes selected areas of deeper waters, possibly to increase feeding efficiency. All species were directly dependent on water for nesting, except for the Water Rail, which established its nest in muddy areas with higher vegetation density and height. Nests were at a higher density for the Whiskered Terns than in other species. Overall, mean water depth at nesting sites was lower in the 2008 breeding season and total breeding population of waterbirds decreased. Evaluating and monitoring of habitat quality of breeding species urges conservation measures with regard to transformations occurring at this freshwater lake ecosystem.

The KDL has been polluted by urban, industrial, and agricultural activities for many years. A seasonal trend was seen in PAH metabolite levels with higher levels detected in May 2005 samples in KDL. Their levels in the bile of fish were not found to be related to sex which showed that gender is not a confounding factor on PAH uptake. The results showed significant decreases in bile metabolite levels in the KDL fish by approximately 75% versus increases in the SDL fish after acclimation at laboratory conditions. These results supported that PAH metabolites in bile were not stable and short-term differences in living conditions may lead to great differences in their levels. Moreover, these rapid changes in bile metabolites with acclimation may also indicate that dam lakes were not badly polluted with PAHs and the feeding status of fish should be taken into consideration when using bile metabolites as biomarkers.

Climate changes in the stratigraphy of the Colombian Amazonian region I. Neogene - Quaternary early	CALDASIA												Stratigraphic units of the Colombian Amazon region are composed of the following geological formations: Solimoes late Miocene age (Neogene period 23.3 to 2.6 Ma Miocene-Pliocene), the Formation Jerico described herein and that was deposited between the Pliocene and Pleistocene, and the formation Isa (Ica), which has been considered of Pleistocene age. In the Holocene is predominant sedimentary material directly related or not with the influence of the Amazon River. Although much of the sedimentary environments of the Solimoes Formation of Tertiary age correspond to rivers and floodplain forest vegetation, lakes and marshes (pantanales) are also present. Some of them have high concentration of salts in solution and sequences of hardened paleosoils that covers positive landforms formed in environments where some vegetation types are similar to the present types but with woodland savannas. The evidence suggests a warm climate with a prolonged dry season. The following stratigraphic unit, which is described herein Jerico, lies in a discordant form on the Solimoes Formation and correspons to fluvial sediments that have been affected by the processes of generation of bauxites after his deposition. This action requires warm climates with a long rainy period, followed by a short dry season. The evidence of processes occurring in the two formations indicates that during the Neogene, the Amazon region (at least the Colombian part) experienced a climate with a dry season, being very long during Solimoes Formation and short in Jerico Formation, but in both cases the climatic conditions were different to the actual climate. Isa Formation has a fluvial origin, with hilly topography that protrudes 2 or 3 meters above the terrace of Leticia, and the nearby Brazilian territory is not covered by the existing terrace. The detritus of the Isa formation have been contributed by reworking of the Jerico Formation and were deposited under very humid condition, with higher rainfall amounts than today. There are materials that directly depend on the involvement of the Amazon River while others are not affected by these dynamics. Among the materials that are not affected by the current cycle are the terrace of Leticia, which covers the Ica Formation. This terrace is the highest of the geological units among those that still retain their original flat morphology. On this terrace there are deposits of drainage channels associated with drainage of the terrace and the floodplain that are important to recognize the differential processes of erosion. Other geologic units are associated to flooded areas by the annual cycle of the Amazon River belong to the Quaternary and can be differentiated according to the relative age, spatial position, development over the water surface, and the dynamics of the Amazon River in the Colombian territory. A description about these units will be treated in a forthcoming paper.																			0366-5232	2357-3759					2011	33	2					539	572																WOS:000208834300015

The results showed that the five rivers runoff for the influx into the Poyang Lake, were decreased since 2002, and the runoff decline phenomenon like this has appeared in the 60's and 80's. About the runoff annual distribution, the uneven distribution was detected. The sum of the monthly runoff from April to July account for 46%similar to 69% about the entire year, and in the dry season, the sum of the monthly runoff from October to next year January only account for 12%similar to 23%. About the each monthly runoff series of the five rivers from 1956 to 2008, it was observed that during the flood season the dispersion coefficient of the series is small, and in the non-flood season the dispersion coefficient of the series is bigger. It illuminated that the monthly runoff series were changer in the non-flood than the flood season and the increased human activities may be the major factor. (c) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The series of interconnected tanks in this system serves multiple functions, including irrigation. This study was carried out to investigate the water quality variation in a tank cascade system and study the role of hydrophytes found in the upper periphery (Thaulla). The Malagane Tank in the northwestern intermediate zone of Sri Lanka was selected for the study. Fairly high levels of nutrients and metal concentrations were recorded in the upstream paddy fields and main inflow of the tank. The concentrations of most of the chemical parameters were showed a decreasing trend while passing the thaulla area which is one of the most important hydrologic regime in a tank system. However, the runoff from the either sides of the tank has polluted the lake water particularly during the rainy season. The hydrophytes in the thaulla area play a major role in the hydrology of the tank system.

Coupling of an individual-based model with a complex aquatic ecosystem model to explore the impact of the upper trophic level on lower trophic levels	19TH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION (MODSIM2011)					MSSANZ 19th Biennial Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM)	DEC 12-16, 2011	Perth, AUSTRALIA	CSIRO, Australian Govt, Bur Meteorol, Per Convent & Exhibit Ctr, Perth Convent Bur, Curtin Univ, Australian Math Soc, Australian & New Zealand Ind & Appl Math, Australian Math Sci Inst, Maralte Publishers, Econ Soc Australian, HEMA Consulting, Simulat Australia, Stat Soc Australia Inc, Modelling & Simulat Soc Australia & New Zealand Inc, Int Assoc Math & Comp Simulat				This article demonstrates an attempt to benefit from the merging of different modeling approaches. A complex aquatic ecosystem model (DYRESM-CAEDYM, DYCD) was coupled to a super individual-based model that simulates a fish population. The coupled model, DYCD-FISH, is a generic model that simulates the fish populations in aquatic systems and their impacts on water quality and lower trophic levels. The model reproduces fish growth and predicts fish impacts on various ecosystem components, including nutrients, phytoplankton, zooplankton, intra-and inter-species dynamics. The coupled model was employed to explore the role of the dominant fish in Lake Kinneret (Israel), Acanthobrama terraesanctae (lavnun). Model results suggested that the lavnun has a significant impact on the density of its prey food (predatory and micro-zooplankton) and on the concentration of major nutrients such as ammonium (NH4) and phosphate (PO4). The merging of the two modeling approaches also provided a means for simulating the intra-guild predation (IGP) dynamics in the lake. The results indicated that predation pressure of predatory zooplankton on herbivorous zooplankton varied widely with season exerting, at the time of its annual peak, an average predation pressure 10-20 times higher than the lavnun. The results presented in the study successfully demonstrated how the linking of various modeling approaches can reveal the nonlinear trophic interaction dynamics within ecosystems.					; Hipsey, Matthew/C-3551-2009	Hipsey, Matthew/0000-0001-8386-4354; 															978-0-9872143-1-7				2011							3740	3746																WOS:000314989303102

Environmental factors including water temperature (WT), secchi depth (SD), water depth (WD), chemical oxygen demand (CODMn), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), chlorophyll-a (Chla), algae cell density (ACD) and cyanophyta cell density (CCD) were measured continuously in two sampling sites that were selected in Xiliu Lake. Trophic level index (Sigma) (TLI(Sigma)), linear correlation and stepwise multiple regression with a significant-value cut-off of alpha=0.05 were used to analyze the data. The result showed that the TLI(Sigma) of Xiliu Lake increased with seasonal changes. Three regression equations of standardized Chla, standardized ACD and standardized CCD were obtained respectively. Tests on these regression equations showed that there was a good correlation between practical value and predictive value of standardized Chla. The correlations for standardized ACD and CCD were even better. In a conclusion, the nutritive condition of Xiliu Lake was eutrophic. A prediction system was established for monitoring the eutrophic condition of surface water through using the three regression equations of standardized Chla, standardized ACD and standardized CCD, which can be used to predict the trend of Chla in Xiliu Lake within a certain range.

The main aim of the programme is to establish degree and geographical extent of acidification of surface waters and evaluate dose/response relationships to aquatic biota attributable to acidic deposition. The sample frequency in each locality is from a few - to a large number every year. Samples of invertebrates are taken from 108 localities. One time samples as well as regularly seasonal samples over years exist in the database. The acidity score (Raddum index) is determined for the different sites and regions, and compared with the corresponding chemical data. The analysis show a strong relationship between water quality and fauna. Sensitive species/taxa are associated with high ANC and pH, while tolerant species/taxa are associated with low pH and ANC. The diversity of the fauna in less acidified areas varies from region to region depending on the native water quality and the adaptions of the fauna. In areas with strongly oligotrophic water, low in ionic strength, the sensitive fauna tolerate lower ANC and pH than in areas with originally high ionic strength and high pH. The critical load of ANC, 20 mu eq/l, developed for the oligotrophic water in Norway, should therefore be increased in watersheds with high ionic strength. In Central Europe the data indicate a critical level of ANC approximate to 50 mu eq/l.																			0049-6979					DEC	1995	85	2					475	480		10.1007/BF00476874	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00476874													WOS:A1995UB05300032

Fourteen were from Aedes provocans, and 6 were from 4 other snowmelt Aedes species. One isolate of trivittatus virus and one Cache Valley-like virus were also obtained. Seasonal succession patterns for numerous mosquito species were recorded over 4 years. The temporal association of adult mosquito emergence, virus isolations, and infection and seroconversion of sentinel deer suggest that Ae. provocans is a primary enzootic vector of Jamestown Canyon virus in that focus. We hypothesize that Ae. provocans provides an overwintering reservoir for Jamestown Canyon virus at the study site. A large dry ice-baited "tent trap" was the most productive method for collecting numerous aedine and other mosquito species.																			8756-971X	1943-6270				SEP	1990	6	3					461	468											2230774					WOS:A1990EA64400019

Correlation of the numbers of beetles washed ashore with the passage of synoptic scale weather systems shows that the beetles accumulate on the shoreline after the passage of cold fronts starting at approximately the date of maximum emergence of WCR and continuing for 24-49 d. The WCR deposited on the shoreline appear to have originated from fields local and distant from the shoreline, with local WCR predominant in deposition events near the time of local maximum emergence and long-distance WCR predominant in deposition events later in the season. Insects appear to be carried along the front. Precipitation does not appear to result in greater deposition of WCR onto the surface, therefore descent of the insect must be by active flight or downdrafts in the front.																			0046-225X	1938-2936				APR	1989	18	2					266	272		10.1093/ee/18.2.266	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/18.2.266													WOS:A1989U076200015
J	Vogrin, M				Vogrin, Milan			Micro-habitat use within a guild of newt larvae (Trituridae) in an Alpine lake	BIOLOGIA												Population and ecological parameters such as numbers of larvae, microhabitat use, niche breadth and niche overlap of three species of syntopic larval newts (Alpine newt Triturus alpestris, Italian crested newt T. carnifex, and common newt T. vulgaris) were studied for two years in a small pond at 1160 in a.s.l. in NE Slovenia. Differences in microhabitat partitioning among larval newts were small. The largest niche breadth was estimated for larval T. alpestris, and the narrowest estimate was for larval T. carnifex in both years. Ecological differences seem to be very small and quite variable among sites and years. It appears that the developmental stage and size of newt larvae are more important in explaining resource partitioning than the characteristics of each species. Because of the absence of potential invertebrate predators and adult newts in the second half of the breeding season, the injuries could only be caused by intra- and interspecific predation attempts.																			0006-3088	1336-9563				SEP	2006	61	5					579	584		10.2478/s11756-006-0093-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11756-006-0093-x													WOS:000243710100018
J	Munthali, SM; Ribbink, AJ				Munthali, SM; Ribbink, AJ			Condition and fecundity of translocated rock-dwelling cichlid fish in Lake Malawi	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												The condition factor and fecundity of the translocated sock-dwelling cichlid fish, Cynotilapia afra, Pseudotropheus callainos, and Pseudotropheus tropheops 'red cheek' at Thumbi West Island, southern Lake Malawi, were compared with those at their sites of origin, in the north of the lake. The guiding hypothesis was that these species, having originated from a region of the lake which is generally poor in nutrients, and been introduced to an area richer in nutrients, would be in better condition and more fecund there than at their sites of origin. That seemed to be the case. P. callainos and P. tropheops 'red cheek' had significantly higher condition factors and fecundity indices at Thumbi West Island than at their sites of origin. However, both condition factor and fecundity of all the species studied fluctuated seasonally. The major peaks in condition factor coincided with either the wind-induced lake upwelling from June to August, or the rains. Major peaks in fecundity occurred at the end of the rainy season, between February and April, or at the end of the upwelling period between September and October. The translocated species began to breed at a smaller size at their sites of origin in the north than at Thumbi West Island, probably as an adaptive response to a poor nutrient regime in the north. The increase in population of some translocated species can be partly attributed to their improved condition and fecundity due to enhanced nutrient availability at the site where they have been introduced. This may have negative implications for the native taxa, more particularly as competition for breeding space is rife among the rock-dwelling cichlids of Lake Malawi.																			0952-8369	1469-7998				MAR	1998	244		3				347	355		10.1017/S0952836998003057	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0952836998003057													WOS:000073590500005

Seventy peatlands were inventoried over the course of the 1996 growing season, and were classified as either muskeg, kettlehole, or coastal sites. Muskeg peatlands were of similar elevation to the surrounding uplands, possessed drier and more nutrient-poor substrates, and were typically larger than other peatland types. Kettlehole peatlands were wetter and had floating Sphagnum mats which fringed lake margins or were in depressions much lower than the surrounding uplands. Coastal peatlands were located in estuaries along the Lake Superior coast, and possessed relatively eutrophic, wet soils. Muskeg sites harbored the most diverse total fauna, and possessed the highest average number of taxa per site. a highly significant correlation between habitat size and butterfly richness was observed in both muskeg and kettlehole peatlands. The muskeg fauna included five taxa not found in other peatland habitats. These species have arctic-boreal affinities and reach their southern range limit in eastern North America an these sites.																			0090-0222					SPR	1998	31	1					27	38																WOS:000076608800004

Many bone specimens exhibit evidence of alteration, supporting interpretation of the feature as an in situ, secondary meat-processing area; the gravels are interpreted as the point bar of a meandering stream. Faunal remains lying stratigraphically above the point bar have been considered to form a separate, noncultural feature produced by stream flooding. However, rose diagrams and analysis of adjusted residuals demonstrate that a statistically significant amount of bone in each feature is aligned along axes of preferred orientation. Further, the orientation patterns and statistical analyses of both features exhibit the same trends, suggesting that the same processes affected both. Although the evidence does not rule out a role of human behavior, it does demonstrate that stream currents significantly influenced feature structure.																			0033-5894	1096-0287				SEP	1988	30	2					221	231		10.1016/0033-5894(88)90026-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0033-5894(88)90026-9													WOS:A1988Q044300010

To assess the reliability of pollen as a chronometer in laminated lake sediments, pollen traps and lake cores, statistical methods were used to study seasonal pollen signals. The results showed that (a) the pollen assemblages from air traps and lake/reservoir surface sediment traps in the north-western Loess Plateau of China displayed distinct seasonal patterns, which were confirmed by nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS); and (b) The pollen assemblages of the dark and light layers in the Zhenhu Lake cores allowed detection of the seasonality of sediment deposition based on the results of the pollen traps. The NMDS method also showed statistically significant differences between the pollen assemblages of the dark and light layers. Furthermore, instrumental monitoring data and characteristic time markers of historical events (1958 and 2011) were used to cross-check the chronologies obtained by the pollen assemblages, and the results strengthened the credibility and reliability of pollen as a chronometer.

J	MCINTYRE, JW				MCINTYRE, JW			LOONS IN FRESH-WATER LAKES	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Loons (Gaviidae) divide their annual cycle between salt and freshwater habitat, the latter being the site of breeding activites. Territorial requirements include sufficient size to permit runs of more than 100 m for take-off and landings; food for chicks and water clarity sufficient to permit foraging for it at depths generally less-than-or-equal-to 5 m; protected nest sites, preferably islands; and shallow vegetated nurseries. Gavia stellata, the smallest and most primitive species, is the exception, and breeds on small tams, requires take-offs of < 50 m, and flies to coastal or riverine waters for all food. Freshwater dependence has increased during loon evolution, shaped their vocalizations, and mandated annual migrations. Hazards include eutrophication, human disturbance, water level fluctuations, toxic pollutants, acid precipation and seasonal unreliability. Loons have long been considered a major indicator of wilderness quality, but their potential as useful monitors of freshwater habitat depends on availability of baseline data, which currently varies among species and geographical regions.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				APR 1	1994	279						393	413		10.1007/BF00027871	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00027871													WOS:A1994NK39900037
J	Hakanson, L				Hakanson, L			A new, simple, general technique to predict seasonal variability of river discharge and lake temperature for lake ecosystem models	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												The aim of this work is to present a new technique to predict seasonal variability in tributary water discharge, lake water retention rate and lake temperature (surface and deep water temperature and stratification) when empirical data are missing, and the basic objective is to model ecosystem rather than hydrological processes. The main features of the technique are the curves (called the norms) describing the maximum (monthly) variability and the smoothing functions (the moderators) to change the maximum variability of the norms. The smoothing functions are calculated from readily available ''map parameters'' (latitude, longitude, altitude, mean annual precipitation, catchment area and lake volume). The norms apply to all lakes of a given type. The aims of this work are to present: (1) the new technique to predict seasonal variability in tributary water discharge (Q); the basic aim is to give an account of the construction of a norm and a seasonal variability moderator; (2) a model based on the same technique to predict seasonal variabilities in surface and bottom water temperature; (3) a model for the retention rate of lake water; (4) sensitivity tests illustrating how these models work, (5) examples how to use these models within the framework of a larger lake ecosystem model; and (6) examples showing that by accounting for the seasonal variability in this way, one can improve the behaviour and predictive accuracy of dynamic lake models. The seasonal moderator technique gives dimensionless expressions that may be used in dynamic models wherever one would like to account for seasonal variability in rates and coefficients. This paper is a technical account of the method. It has, however, been outside the scope to provide thorough empirical calibrations.																			0304-3800					JUL	1996	88	1-3					157	181		10.1016/0304-3800(95)00083-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3800(95)00083-6													WOS:A1996UR06100015

The temporal resolution of the analysis approximately equals biweekly sampling of the plankton community throughout the 418-year period. We identified over 140,000 frustules, representing 24 plankton diatom taxa. On the longest temporal scale, three major periods can be defined according to the dominant taxon: 1539 to 1690 (Aulacoseira italica v. tenuissima); 1691 to 1850 (Cyclotella pseudostelligera) and 1851 to 1956 (Aulacoseira granulata v. angustissima). However, the species composition of the community varied greatly from one year to another, and the long-term patterns of the taxa are highly individualistic. The dominant and uncommon species have similar distributional variances of the log-transformed annual abundances, in spite of the difference in the mean. Species richness was high from 1539 until 1600. Aulacoseira italica bloomed in the plankton, producing a mass of frustules in the 1601 varve, from which year onwards a single species tended to be strongly dominant in the community and species richness was low. Analysis of the seasonal occurrence patterns of the species within the varves revealed a relatively constant successional ranking order; the taxa have retained their specific seasonality despite major changes in the community. The dominant taxa have not occurred especially early or especially late in the season.																			0003-3847	1797-2442					1990	27	3					241	259																WOS:A1990EM06300006
J	EDMONDSON, WT; LEHMAN, JT				EDMONDSON, WT; LEHMAN, JT			THE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN THE NUTRIENT INCOME ON THE CONDITION OF LAKE WASHINGTON	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Lake Washington received increasing amounts of secondary sewage effluent from 1941-1963 and responded by changes in the amount of nutrients in the water and in the kind and quantity of phytoplankton. From 1963-1968, the amount of effluent entering the lake progressively decreased to zero and the lake responded with decreases in the amount of nutrients, quantity of phytoplankton and proportion of blue-green algae. The lake recovered from eutrophication by 1975. P and N income from sewage, inlets and atmosphere were calculated from direct measurements or approximated from other data and from regressions with hydrological income. Total P input varied from a maximum of 204.2 .times. 103 kg/yr in 1964 to a low of 42.9 in 1973 and 1976. The maximum fraction from sewage was 72.4% in 1962. Total N varied from 1419 .times. 103 kg/yr in 1964 to 734 in 1976. Total P content of the lake varied in close correlation with input from a maximum of .apprx. 200 .times. 103 kg (equivalent to a mean concentration of .apprx. 69 .mu.g/l) to a mean of .apprx. 50 .times. 103 kg during the postrecovery era. The sewage episode affected the P regime more than N. There were seasonal differences in the deposition of P to and release from sediments, the average net long term retention being .apprx. 57% of the income, slight changes in retention during and after diversion resulted in a greater fraction of influent P being lost to the sediments after diversion. The amount of P lost permanently to the sediments during a year was more closely to the annual income than to the mean concentration in the water.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1981	26	1					1	29		10.4319/lo.1981.26.1.0001	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1981.26.1.0001													WOS:A1981LF25600001

Trophic status of a non-native crayfish in an oligotrophic lake: bottom-up view of a mixed warmwater and coldwater sport fishery food web	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Numerous studies in recent decades have observed variable trophic status for freshwater crayfish among endemic and exotic populations in lentic or lotic habitats. In this study, we used stable isotope analyses (SIA) to explore trophic status of an introduced population of northern crayfish (Faxonius virilis) in Buffalo Lake, Washington. Northern crayfish are an important prey item for introduced warmwater and coldwater fish species in this lentic system and may buffer competitive interactions between largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), and kokanee (Oncorhynchus nerka). In 2017, the delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of liver samples from 208 crayfish informed proportional diet estimates. Crayfish diets were comprised of 8 littoral sources and were examined for cannibalism, temporal, spatial, and ontogenetic trophic shifts. There was no significant spatial or temporal trophic shift detected in this crayfish population. Seasonal delta N-15 values among all crayfish size classes mirrored seasonal abundance shifts of littoral macroinvertebrates. A multiple-source stable isotope mixing model and relative trophic positions provided evidence for an ontogenetic trophic shift between juvenile and adult crayfish, from a generalist detritivore to a predatory diet dominated by Chironomidae and Ephemeroptera. The trophic status of Buffalo Lake crayfish may affect salmonid management goals if interspecific competition for food between crayfish and sport fish is biologically significant. Our research is an important first step to understanding crayfish trophic status in a lentic food web, and should inform fish stocking regimes and fishery regulations in management efforts to achieve long-term sustainability of this diverse fishery.

By coupling experimentally-measured equilibrium partition coefficients of a model HOC to the major particle species with the particle model, we predict both particle-specific phase partitioning of the HOC in the water column and fluxes to the sediments over an annual cycle. The results indicate a dynamic seasonal and spatial cycle of HOC association with particulate material, largely controlled by biological particle production events. Diatoms are the major sorptive particle type for HOCs in the water column during much of the year. Diatoms also serve as the major vector for HOC removal from the water column to the sediments. The fate of contaminants associated with autochthonous particles subject to diagenesis and dissolution near the sediment-water interface is uncertain. Significant phase redistribution of HOCs is likely in the benthic nepheloid layer and the upper few centimeters of sediments.																			0380-1330						1993	19	2					480	496		10.1016/S0380-1330(93)71234-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(93)71234-4													WOS:A1993LN30700026

One plot was maintained free of mites by means of acaricide, while the other was artificially infested. The highest population density of M. tanajoa occurred during the dry season. A maximum leaf area index (LAI) of about 2 was reached at the onset of the dry season. The total leaf area of mite infested plants was reduced compared with uninfested plants during the dry spell. During the following rainy season infested plants recovered and attained the same leaf area as uninfested plants. A multiple regression model predicting the leaf area showed that 58% of the seasonal variation could be explained by plant age, soil water, and leaf injury. The net growth rate of infested plants was lower than that of uninfested plants. Maximum values of 21 (infested plants) and 49 (uninfested plants) g m-2 week-1 were attained at the onset of the second rainy season. No difference was found between uninfested and infested plants with respect to net assimilation rates per unit leaf area during the dry season. The net assimilation rates reached a maximum almost at the same time as the growth rates, but the infested plants peaked slightly earlier and at a lower level than the uninfested plants. M. tanajoa did not affect the relative allocation of dry matter into stems and storage roots, but the absolute allocation of dry matter declined with increasing mite injury. Thus, after 10 months the dry matter of infested plants was reduced by 29% and 21% for storage roots and stems, respectively, compared with the uninfested plants.

Larval densities were calculated for the neuston, epilimnion, metalimnion, and hypolimnion strata of the water column. Larval densities were generally less than 0.4 m-3 with the exception of bloater (Coregonus hoyi) which reached 15 m-3 in the offshore neuston in August. The abundance of larvae was estimated for a 1-km-wide (N-S) by 26.2-km-long (E-W) strip of the lake and discussed with respect to inshore (0.7-7.1 km), intermediate (7.1-11.1 km), and offshore (11.1-26.9 km) zones. The inshore was dominated by larval rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) and alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), and the offshore zone was dominated by bloater and deepwater sculpin (Myoxocephalus thompsoni). The changes in abundance and distribution of larvae reflected differences in spawning and hatching seasons and behavior of the different species. Species richness (number of species) increased and subsequently decreased in a progression from inshore to offshore. Maximum species richess occurred in June and July. Abundance was always higher in offshore waters. Maximum larval abundance occurred early in the season (June) and declined steadily through to September. Deepwater sculpin was the most abundant larval species in the areas sampled. Together, deepwater sculpin and bloater constituted 70-99% of the total abundance of larvae. In general, there was little overlap in the distributions of the various species over temporal and depth scales. Bloater and deepwater sculpin were separated from each other by their depth distributions; alewives were separated temporally from all other species.

Areas that experienced the lowest to the highest ozone exposures were located in (1) northern New England/New York and upper Great Lakes, (2) New York/Pennsylvania/Maryland, (3) southeastern/southern, and (4) New Jersey pinelands [USA]. In general, higher ozone concentrations were observed in 1978, 1980 and 1983 as compared to the other three years examined. Ozone concentrations varied considerably within the areas. Recommendations for additional ozone monitoring sites are made. A concentrated effort should be made to examine ozone monitoring data from subsequent years (1984, 1985, and 1986) to explore whether the 6-year period 1978 through 1983 is representative of the annual variability of ozone concentrations over eastern forested areas. To better understand the relationship between ozone exposure and possible forest effects, we recommend that the temporal distributions of elevated ozone concentrations over a growing season be examined. The occurrnece of elevated ozone levels during specific growth periods during a season may be an important aspect that biologists may wish to explore.

J	KEOUGH, MJ				KEOUGH, MJ			PATTERNS OF RECRUITMENT OF SESSILE INVERTEBRATES IN 2 SUBTIDAL HABITATS	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Recruitment of sessile marine invertebrates onto small panels at 2 subtidal sites in southern Australia varied considerably on all spatial and temporal scales. Recruitment at West Lakes [South Australia] was consistently higher than at Edithburgh, usually by an order of magnitude or more. There were strong seasonal trends in the number of recruits and the number of colonizing species per panel at West Lakes, but these trends were unclear at Edithburgh. Small panels received fewer recruits than did larger panels, although the number of recruits per square centimeter did not change. Individual species showed similar patterns of recruitment. The temporal pattern varied from year-round settlement, with seasonal peaks (most serpulids), to regular recruitment at the same time each year (Didemnum sp., Botrylloides leachii Savigny), to irregular, intense peaks of recruitment (Electroma georgiana Quoy and Gaimard and Ciona intestinalis (Linnaeus)). Even those species that showed regular peaks in recruitment showed great variation between years in the magnitude of the peaks. The spatial pattern of recruitment of individual species varied from random (Spirobis spp.) to strongly aggregated (Elminius modestus Darwin and Monia ione Gray). Aggregated patterns of recruitment were probably due to settlement near adult conspecifics (E. modestus and Balanus amphitrite Darwin), or to swarms of larvae settling together (Hydroides norvegica (Gunnerus)). There was little synchrony between the 2 sites. Major peaks in recruitment at 1 site were not accompanied by peaks at the other site, and even a good year for a particular species at 1 site was not necessarily matched for the species at the other site, providing little support for the concept of generally good or bad years for a coastal region as a whole. Replicated panels that were immersed at the same time varied greatly in their recruitment. This was partly explained by the distance between panels: the similarity between a pair of panels sometimes decreased as the distance between them increased. This relation rarely explained > 20% of the variation in similarities. Small panels were generally less similar to each other than were large panels. The increase in similarity as panels became closer together could not always be explained by gregarious behavior of larvae, and was probably due to small-scale patchiness in the distribution of larvae in the plankton. There remained a large amount of variation in recruitment that could not be explained by the behavior of individual species or by patchiness in the plankton.

JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												In physoclistous fishes, barotrauma caused by rapid decompression during capture may be an important source of fishing mortality that is unquantified for some fisheries. We developed a predictive logistic model for barotrauma incidence in Yellow Perch Perca flavescens and applied this model to Ohio's recreational and commercial fisheries in Lake Erie where fisheries managers implicitly consider discard mortality to be negligible in current stock assessment. As expected, capture depth explained most of the variation in incidence, with comparatively small effects of season, sex, and size categories. Measurements of whole body and gonad density provided limited explanation for the categorical effects. Both fisheries spanned a range of depths (7.6 to 16.8 m) that corresponded to a broad range of barotrauma incidence (13 to 74%). Using a recent example, we estimated that additional fishing mortality due to barotrauma in discards was approximately six-fold higher in the commercial than recreational fishery. Overall, this additional mortality was <1% of lake-wide population size estimates. Thus, the assumption that all discarded Yellow Perch survive is unlikely to result in a detectable bias in population estimates. One caveat is that we still do not understand how strong year-classes might influence discard mortality via increased discard rate and barotrauma incidence for small fish.

Northern pike were short-lived; the oldest fish collected was age 8. Female northern pike lived longer than male fish, and mean length-at-age was significantly higher for females than for males. Significant increases in mean body length occurred during cool- and cold-water seasons, but no increases in mean length were found for either sex from July through August, which was the period of highest water temperature. Incremental growth in length (mm/d) for male northern pike was related to water temperature, with maximum growth rates occurring in the range of approximately 8-18 degrees C.

Annulus formation was validated up to 11+ years by several methods. Otoliths were examined from hatchery-bred fish of known age (up to 4+ years) that had been stocked into local farm ponds. Analysis of incremental growth for all fish sampled from the lake indicated that the mean edge-growth ratio was lowest, and the percentage of otoliths with an annulus at the edge was highest, in October. A nominal birth date of 1 October was designated for the population to enable calculation of the absolute age for each fish. Age-composition data for those fish taken by gill-net and by anglers (up to 21+ years) revealed modal progression of strong year classes (1970 to 1973 inclusive) during the sampling period. Length-frequency data for those fish taken by beach-seine (up to 3+ years) revealed modal progression, on a seasonal basis, of two relatively strong year classes (1978 and 1979) during the sampling period. A von Bertalanffy growth curve was fitted to length and age data for all fish collected in the lake (no sex difference, P>0.05), and growth parameters were estimated for the population (L(infinity) = 695 mm). This curve did not adequately describe the growth of fish older than 11+ years because the majority of sampled fish (98.3%) were aged 11+ years or younger. The length-weight relationship for the population was determined by using data from all fish collected in the lake (no sex difference, P>0.05).																			0067-1940						1992	43	5					1091	1102																WOS:A1992KU72900014

Investigation into odor cases included the following: sensory and instrumental (gas chromatography/mass spectrometry) analyses of odorous water samples, enumeration and identification of cyanobacteria, algae and actinomycetes present in the samples and attempts to establish cultures of responsible microorganisms for confirmation of odor production. The possibility of concomitant production of toxins by odor-forming cyanobacteria is also discussed. Incidence of off-flavors of 30% was established. All affected reservoirs wer dominated by cyanobacteria, mainly Microcystis aeruginosa. Odorous substances detected in water were geosmin and dimethyl trisulphide. Efforts to isolate odor-producing organisms in culture were unsuccessful. From individual case histories studied it is clear that odor incidents in man-made lakes present a serious problem in South Africa. The warmer climatic conditions and seasonally fluctuating water level create additional factors for odor formation, which are different from those experienced in more temperate regions.																			0273-1223						1992	25	2					225	232		10.2166/wst.1992.0056	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.1992.0056													WOS:A1992HR70900030

Developing Nonpoint-Source Suspended Solids Control Strategies Using Multimedia Watershed Management Modeling	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												Kaoping River Basin is the largest and most intensively used river basin in Taiwan. In this study, 14 types of land-use patterns in the basin are classified with the aid of the Erdas Imagine process (Erdas, Inc., Atlanta, Georgia) and ArcView geographic information system (GIS) (ESRI, Redlands, California). Results from GIS identification and field verification indicate that orchard gardens, rice paddies, and sugarcane fields dominate the farmland areas in the basin. Investigation results indicate that nonpoint-source (NPS) pollution has significant contributions to the suspended solids load to the Kaoping River during the wet season. The average suspended solids concentrations increased from below 64 mg/L in dry seasons to more than 1700 mg/L in wet seasons. The Integrated Watershed Management Model (Systech Engineering, Inc., San Ramon, California) was applied to simulate the water quality and evaluate the NPS suspended solids load to the river.

In this study, statistical techniques were used to test for changes in water-quality data from watersheds where best management practices (BMPs) were implemented. Reductions in data variability due to climate and seasonality were accomplished through the use of regression methods. This study discusses the merits of using storm-mass-transport data as a means of improving the ability to detect BMP effects on stream-water quality. Statistical techniques were applied to suspended-sediment records from three rural watersheds in Illinois for the period 1981-84. None of the techniques identified changes in suspended sediment, primarily because of the small degree of BMP implementation and because of potential errors introduced through the estimation of storm-mass transport. A Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis was used to determine the level of discrete change that could be detected for each watershed. In all cases, the use of regressions improved the ability to detect trends.																			0733-9437	1943-4774				MAR-APR	1994	120	2					334	347		10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9437(1994)120:2(334)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9437(1994)120:2(334)													WOS:A1994NC98800008

For monitoring programs that emphasize a large number of lakes at the expense of frequent samples, high variability may influence how representative single samples are of the average conditions of individual lakes. Intensive temporal data from long-term research sites provide a unique opportunity to assess chemical variability in lakes with different characteristics. We compared the intra- and inter-annual variability of four acidification related variables ( Gran alkalinity, pH, sulphate concentration, and total base cation concentration) in four lakes with different flushing rates and acid deposition histories. Variability was highest in lakes with high flushing rates and was not influenced by historic acid deposition in our study lakes. This has implications for the amount of effort required in monitoring programs. Lakes with high flushing rates will require more frequent sampling intervals than lakes with low flushing rates. Consideration of specific lake types should be included in the design of monitoring programs.

Forty-five days later the 93 subjects who presented for follow-up were all stool-negative. Blood samples were collected from all 93 individuals. S. japonicum soluble worm antigen (SWAP) and soluble egg antigen (SEA) stimulated IL-4, IL-5 and IFN-gamma production in whole-blood cultures were measured by ELISA. All the subjects were interviewed nine times during the subsequent transmission season to estimate the intensity of their contact with potentially infective snail habitats, and the subjects were all re-screened for S. japonicum by the Kato method at the end of the transmission season. Fourteen subjects were found to be infected at that time. There was some indication that the risk of infection might be associated with gender (with females being at higher risk) and with the intensity of water contact, and there was evidence that levels of SEA-induced IFN-gamma production were associated with reduced risk of infection.

J	Al-Homaidan, AA; Arif, IA				Al-Homaidan, AA; Arif, IA			Ecology and bloom-forming algae of a semi-permanent rain-fed pool at Al-Kharj, Saudi Arabia	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												An account of seasonal succession of bloom-forming algae over a period of 3 consecutive years (1992-1995) is described in relation to the trophic changes taking place in a semi-permanent rain-fed pool at Al-Kharj, Saudi Arabia. Population dynamics from the two contrasting arid ecosystems show varied degrees of changes in water chemistry and algal flora. Recovery of algal blooms after a few flashflood events can be described as a model of temporal succession in the semi-permanent/desiccated water body. Morphometric properties and mesotrophic planktonic biota were restored within 2-3 weeks of rainfall (5-10 cm water deposited). The dominant and the first to emerge was the bloom-forming green alga Carteria multifilis followed by Micratinium pusillum. A gradient seasonal succession from relatively mesotrophic to hypertrophic was recorded. Subsequently, the blue-green algae Oscillatoria limnetica and Microcystis aeruginosa succeeded resulting in bluish-green to drab olive colourization to the water. Altogether, 32 species are reported, c. 30% of which are newly recorded to the Saudi Arabian algal flora. Emergence and survival of consistent flora was positively correlated with water quality and seasonal succession. (C) 1998 Academic Press Limited.

Characteristics of scales, bristles and spines serve to separate the three taxa. The length and area of scales of M. duerrschmidtiae are significantly larger than those of M. crassiquama but smaller than those of M. pseudocoronata. Although the anterior submarginal ribs of scales of M. duerrschmidtiae may become extended to form short wings, the scales lack the large forward projecting anterior wings characteristic of scales of M. pseudocoronata. Features of the dome and junction between the arms of the V-rib and anterior submarginal rib also serve to distinguish between the three species. Cell of M. duerrschmidtiae also possess long, smooth and thick spines on their posterior scales and lack helmet bristles. M. duerrschmidtiae has different maxima along pH, temperature, specific conductance, total phosphorus and seasonal gradients than either M. crassiquama or M. pseudocoronata. Discriminant analysis, based on nine morphological characters, was used to successfully classify body scales of the three species. The importance of M. duerrschmidtiae as a bioindicator in future lake monitoring and paleolimnological inference studies is discussed.																			0022-3646					DEC	1990	26	4					728	740		10.1111/j.0022-3646.1990.00728.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0022-3646.1990.00728.x													WOS:A1990EQ82300019
J	Hofmann, A; Filella, M				Hofmann, A; Filella, M			Transport of suspended matter in the hypolimnion of Lake Lugano: a comparison of field observations and model predictions	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												An unusual feature was observed in the anoxic hypolimnion of the north basin of Lake Lugano during a campaign of regular measurements of turbidity profiles by forward light scattering nephelometry: turbidity increased with depth and decreased with time over the period of investigation (November 1992 to January 1994). Correlation of the chemical composition of the major elements present in lake particles with turbidity allowed the association of the measured turbidity with inorganic, mainly alumino-silicate particles. Particles in the turbidity structure probably originated from a gravity current triggered by a landslide that occurred in the port of Lugano in March 1992. Seasonal events such as fluxes of authochthonous calcite or diatom frustules had little influence on the observed hypolimnion turbidity. Allochthonous particles from flood events did Mot markedly affect the sedimentation structure either. Calculations showed that the evolution of the suspended particles cannot be explained by taking only particle sedimentation into account. To test whether particle aggregation could have been the dominating process leading to rapid settling, a simple coagulation-sedimentation model for hydrophobic particles was used to simulate the sedimentation event. The model provided clear evidence that particles involved in the sedimentation process were fine sized (1 to 2 mu m mean diameter) and that coagulation played a major role in the sedimentation of mineral particles. Difficulties encountered in fitting the second phase of particle removal (after June 1993) have been tentatively explained by the increase in particle stability caused by the mineralization of the abundant organic matter generated during the lake productivity period.					; Hofmann, Annette/GZL-7957-2022	Hofmann, Annette/0000-0003-3486-9524; 													0380-1330						1999	25	4					865	882		10.1016/S0380-1330(99)70784-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(99)70784-7													WOS:000085976300022

Effect of Environmental Variables on Zooplankton Assemblages in Two Brackish Water Bodies	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF MARINE BIOLOGY												The objective of the research was to determine whether the Vistula Lagoon and Lake ebsko, both brackish water bodies, provide similar habitat conditions for zooplankton. The physical and chemical parameters of the water and biological indicators were examined based on the example of zooplankton assemblages in samples collected from June to October in 2010 and 2011. The two water bodies investigated exhibited low water transparency, fluctuating water pH from slightly acidic to slightly alkaline, good oxygen conditions, and frequent hyperoxia. The salinity profiles in both reservoirs were shaped by inflows of riverine and marine waters. The nutrient concentrations between the Vistula Lagoon and Lake ebsko did not differ significantly, except for that of ammonium nitrogen in 2010. The values recorded for orthophosphates, total phosphorus, and chlorophyll a concentration were comparable in both water bodies. The physical and chemical parameters of the water in the research seasons differed significantly in terms of pH and temperature ranges in both of the basins investigated. No clear trends in the variability of the remaining parameters were observed either seasonally or spatially. The study demonstrated that the two water bodies provide moderately similar habitat conditions to the zooplankton that inhabit them.

Modeling vertical gradients in water columns: A parametric autoregressive approach	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS												Vertical gradients (e.g., water temperature and density) are a measurable expression of the potential energy of a water body, which is a fundamental driver for biogeochemical processes in aquatic ecosystems. Seasonal vertical stratification is typically described by the mixed layer and thermocline depths, and these metrics are often estimated through visual assessment of graphical plots or using numerical methods. The most widely used numerical method estimates the derivative of temperature (or density) along the depth, but it is sensitive both to profile data resolution and presence of nonconforming observations. In this study, we propose a new method of modeling vertical gradients using a four-parameter sigmoidal function, including temporal autocorrelation. The parameters were estimated through Bayesian nonlinear regression with conditional autoregressive errors. The proposed method provides a quantitative and automated way to estimate the mixed layer and thermocline depths even for data profiles with a poor resolution. It also showed good performance against high-frequency measurement data.

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the trophic environment status using the Trophic State Index (TSI) in an aquaculture activity in a netcage system in the Lajeado reservoir, Palmas, Tocantins during the dry season. The monitoring was carried out from May / 2017 to August / 2017 and involved the water sampling for analysis of the following water quality parameters: total phosphorus and chlorophyll-a. At the same time, data were collected on temperature, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, pH and total dissolved solids. The Trophic State Index (TSI) results showed that the area under study during the months of May and August was predominantly under a supereutrophic condition. It indicates that the lake trophic state in the aquaculture surrounding area is strongly influenced by external anthropogenic activities. Thus, the effects of this activity in the medium and long term are difficult to predict, so it's necessary to monitor and control the water quality.

A ratio of autotrophs to heterotrophs lower than 1 which lasted more than two thirds of the study period may suggest a high algal productivity per unit of biomass. The estimated strong top-down regulation of phytoplankton by zooplankton indicates an efficient utilization of resources. A comparative analysis between the available food supply and the critical food concentration that is necessary to maintain the population of Daphnia pulicaria (which constitutes up to 98 % of the heterotrophic biomass) proves this species to be food-limited in the lake under study. To explain the dominance (and development) of such large-bodied cladoceran population, we discuss the possibility of the utilization of naked protozoan ciliates (Oligotrichidae) as a complementary high quality food source, and the exploitation of benthic resources through a coupled daily migration behaviour.

Levels were positively correlated with aqueous Cd concentrations and negatively correlated with lake water Ca, organic carbon, and total phosphorus concentrations. A stepwise regression model developed for these lakes overestimated Cd concentrations in zooplankton from acidic (pH < 5), clear-water lakes, presumably because the acidity of these lakes depressed Cd uptake. Cdz levels varied by 5-fold over the ice-free season in Plastic Lake, an acidifying lake in south central Ontario. While Cdz levels were not correlated with zooplankton composition in the lake survey, temporal variations in Cdz levels in Plastic Lake were attributed, in part, to seasonal and annual changes in zooplankton community structure in the lake.

The fish were caught in a sandy bay 4 km north-west of Bujumbura (Burundi) during the dry season, from August until October 1993. Three different habitats were sampled: an area 600 m offshore at a depth of 15 m, a littoral zone near a reed bed (depth, 0-5 m), and an area near a sandy beach (depth, 5 m). The fish were most active in the early morning and at night, except for X. caudafasciata which was the most diurnal. X. ochrogenys was confined to the vicinity of the reeds, where few individuals of the other species were found, and prey comprised mainly ostracods, copepods and chironomid larvae (Tanytarsini). X. ornatipinnis and X. longispinis occurred in large numbers both at a depth of 15 m and near the sandy beach. X. ornatipinnis preyed mainly on copepods, oligochaetes, diatoms and chironomid larvae. X. longispinis had a wider range of temporal and spatial distribution compared with the other species and fed on copepods, ostracods and chironomid larvae (mainly Microchironomus spp.). X. caudafasciata (only caught at 15 m) fed mostly on profundal chironomid larvae (Tanypodinae and Microchironomus spp.). Trophic niche overlap between X. longispinis and X. caudafasciata appeared to be reduced through different activity patterns. Few intraspecific differences in food diet were found between sex and age groups.

In the last nine years (1978-86), escapements have averaged over 250,000 with a record high of 486,000 adults in 1985. The increase in escapements were inversely related to seasonal macrozooplankton densities (p < 0.05; r2=0.42) but directly correlated with increases in the cladoceran to copepod ratio (p < 0.001). In addition, the average body length of the smallest macrozooplankter (Bosmina) has shifted below the observed threshold length of 0.40 mm for juvenile sockeye prey. We also found an inverse relationship between greater parental escapements and age 1. smolt length (p < 0.01; r2=0.75). Small-sized molts produced from a density-dependent rearing environment indicate that spawning capacity equals or exceeds rearing capacity. Juvenile recruits from larger escapements (.apprx.400,000) exerted a controlling, density-dependent influence on the secondary trophic level which drastically reduced subsequent adult returns. Moreover, adverse trophic level changes, particularly after the largest escapements, also appeared to reduce the rearing efficiency for lower densities of juveniles, as subsequent smolt sizes from smaller escapements were less than expected. Thus, these findings not only provide a rationale for suggesting that fewer spawners would provide recruits more closely matching the rearing capacity of this lake, but also provide empirical evidence for the potential adverse density-dependent effects of large escapements.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				MAY	1988	45	5					856	867		10.1139/f88-104	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f88-104													WOS:A1988N748600012

The CH4 profiles were relatively constant, with little stratification and low concentrations (0.05-0.5 .mu.M). The number of methane-oxidizing bacteria detected by a filter-plating method was routinely < 1/ml throughout the water column, and no incorporation or oxidation of CH4 was detected by radioisotopic labeling, even after CH4 was added. Samples taken from the sediment-water interface contained as much as 3 .mu.M CH4 and 50 colony-forming units of CH4-oxidizing bacteria/ml and showed significant rates of CH4 oxidation and incorporation. To define the region of maximum activity more precisely, vertical profiles of the sediment were examined. The CH4 concentration increased with depth to a maximum of 150-325 .mu.M at 2.5 cm, and signficant rates of CH4 oxidation were found within the top 2.5 cm. The apparent Km for CH4 and O2 were determined for samples from the top 1.0 cm of the sediment and found to be .apprx. 10 and 20 .mu.M, respectively.

J	KEDDY, PA				KEDDY, PA			QUANTIFYING WITHIN-LAKE GRADIENTS OF WAVE ENERGY - INTERRELATIONSHIPS OF WAVE ENERGY, SUBSTRATE PARTICLE-SIZE AND SHORELINE PLANTS IN AXE LAKE, ONTARIO	AQUATIC BOTANY												Exposure is defined as the total effect of waves on lakeshore vegetation. Waves may affect shoreline plants directly (e.g., by uprooting seedlings) or indirectly (e.g., by eroding for sediments). Exposure may be an important ecological factor affecting the within-lake distribution of shoreline plants. A method for identifying exposure gradients, using wind data and fetch measurements was developed. Fetch was either measured directly from aerial photographs for 16 compass bearings (direct fetch) or calculated from 32 compass bearings to compensate for the shape of the lake basin (effective fetch). Wind data were either mean wind velocity multiplied by directional percent frequency or exceedance by direction. Four time periods May, growing season, ice-free season and entire year, were considered. This yielded 2 .times. 2 .times. 4 = 16 measures of exposure. A total of 25 points on a 600 m section of shoreline on Axe Lake, Ontario, Canada were sampled for sediment characteristics (proportion silt and clay; sand sorting coefficient) and shoreline plants (depth ranges occupied by 6 selected species). Exposure values then were calculated for all 25 points using the 16 different methods of calculation. Spearman rank correlation coefficients were used to determine the correlation between calculated exposure values, sediment characteristics and species distributions. The sand sorting coefficient, Eriocaulon septangulare With., Nymphoides cordata (Ell.) Fern. and Utricularia cornuta Michx. were positively correlated with all measures of exposure. Proportion silt and clay, Brasenia schreberi Gmel., Dulichium arundinaceum (L.) Britt. and Pontederia cordata L. were negatively correlated with all measures of exposure. Calculations based on direct fetch yielded the strongest correlations. When effective fetch was used, measurements based on annual or May exceedance by direction values yielded the best results. Apparently, calculated measures of exposure provided a biologically meaningful way to rank areas of shoreline along an exposure gradient.																			0304-3770	1879-1522					1982	14	1					41	58		10.1016/0304-3770(82)90085-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(82)90085-7													WOS:A1982PF51000004

Total annual natural mortality of yellow perch in Dauphin Lake, Manitoba, was approximately 61%; predation by northern pike Esox lucius accounted for 19% and 45% of natural mortality for female and male yellow perch, respectively. Yellow perch harbored 18 species of parasites, of which R. acus was the most abundant; 95% of all R. acus larvae inhabited the liver. The number of free and encapsulated larvae and nodules in the liver of yellow perch varied seasonally and with fish gender, but it was not correlated with water temperature or fish habitat. Mean intensity but not recruitment increased with age of yellow perch. Density of R. acus (larvae per gram of liver) was highest in young, immature yellow perch and decreased with age in mature yellow perch. Yellow perch with high-density infections had lower condition factors, and their weight-at-age curves showed reduced slope (males and females) or a shift toward the ordinate (males). Reduced weight was most pronounced when densities of larvae were high (> 50 larvae/g liver). Parasite-induced mortality accounted for much of the unexplained natural mortality of yellow perch. Many small yellow perch males with high-density infections apparently failed to mature; those that did mature had reduced weight. Females with high-density infections either died soon after the onset of vitellogenesis or matured later. Sex-related, parasite-induced mortality might explain the preponderance of females and the bimodal weight distribution that develop with age in natural populations of yellow perch. Furthermore, parasites (especially tissue-invasive types) may play a significant role in the regulation of yellow perch populations.

Quarterly samplings from September 2006 to June 2007 in the lakes and rivers resulted in a sample of 739 specimens, whose muscle caloric density was determined using a calorimeter. Differences between the caloric averages of the males and females and among the different stages of gonadal development were not significant. Caloric density varied over time and space, with two seasonal variation trends. The intensity of the correlation between the caloric density and each environmental variable, as well as the type of correlation, varied according to the sampled site. Body size and reproductive cycle were not correlated with caloric density.					; Benedito, Evanilde/F-2418-2012; Garcia, Daniela/HKF-4041-2023; Takeda, Alice/C-6337-2017	Benedito, Evanilde/0000-0002-3494-9949; 													1516-8913	1678-4324				SEP-OCT	2010	53	5					1109	1118		10.1590/S1516-89132010000500015	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1516-89132010000500015													WOS:000284591200015

The prevalence of infection due to cystacanths of an acanthocephalan, Polyacanthorhynchus kenyensis Schmidt et Canaris, 1967 among parasitized O. leucostictus ranged from 30.4 to 86.9%; among T. zillii from 4.1 to 77.7%; in M, salmoides from 20 to 50%; and in B, amphigrama from 5.8 to 100%. In 735 hosts belonging to the above four species, a total of 4198 immature specimens of P. kenyensis were recovered. All cystacanths were found in extraintestinal sites, either free within the fish body cavity or encysted within the host visceral organs. There was no significant variation in the prevalence of the parasite within months (P > 0.001). Host sex ratio was significant (P < 0.001) in favour of male T. zillii, and also highly significant (P < 0.001) in favour of male O. leucostictus. Moreover, in this fish, prevalence of infection was observed to increase with the increase in the size of the fish. Among infected M. salmoides, there was no significant departure from a 1 : 1 sex ratio.

Three distribution patterns were created using 37-50 artificial targets/metal hex nuts) anchored at known positions. Real and acoustic maps were qualitatively similar. Aggregation indices estimated by hydroacoustics were within 15% of the real values. Target density ranged from 1 to 8 targets per 100 m(-3). Estimated target densities were within one target of the real values for 88% of our observations. The variable angle approach Nas used also to monitor daily and seasonal variations in Fish distribution and relative abundance outside the littoral zone. Dace Phoximus eos x P. neogaeus appeared to use the littoral as a refuge during the day. and to migrate to the pelagic zone at dusk. The movements of dace outside thr littoral zone were limited to the months of June-August. The variable angle acoustic approach can be useful to estimate fish distribution and relative abundance in shallow lakes.

J	Johnson, PG				Johnson, PG			Spatial and temporal variability of ice-dammed lake sediments in alpine environments	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The stratigraphic record of ice-dammed lakes is the product of a combination of daily, intraseasonal, seasonal and interseasonal fluctuations in sediment input combined with periods of drawdown or drainage of the lake. Sedimentation may take place on an ice-cored bed which produces deformation structures on melting and eventually results in limited preservation during and after deglaciation. The sediments of the contemporary and older ice-dammed lakes in the Kaskawulsh and Dusty Glacier basins of the southwest Yukon reflect a number of hydrological regimes and lake histories, and also demonstrate the complexity of the sedimentary environment. The Kaskawulsh Glacier lake evolved from being semi-permanent at the start of deglaciation from the Little Ice Age maximum to annually draining at present. The Dusty Glacier Lake was impounded by glacier surges and had a duration of only a few years after each surge. A model of the effects of variations in sediment source, contrasting hydrological regimes and geomorphological events on sediment accumulation illustrates how spatial and temporal variability is the predominant characteristic of the sediments.

Macroinvertebrate and rotifer biomonitoring (based on the global and Belgian biotic index and on the Sladecek index respectively) were used as bioindicators. These biotic indices were related to the main physical and chemical parameters monitored between the source and the town of Malmedy (i.e., a river length of 40 km). Important seasonal and longitudinal changes of physical, chemical and biological water quality occur. The deterioration of the water quality in the river Warche is obvious in two sectors of the river. Strong organic pollution and eutrophication were observed between the source and the sampling station located downstream of Bullingen. Indeed, along this sector, tributaries, sewage and dairy effluent flow into the Warche and induce significant increase of nitrate, nitrite, ammonium and phosphate concentrations. As a consequence, biotic indices decrease significantly downstream of Bullingen and the most abundant rotifer species are clearly eutrophic indicators. Another important decrease of water quality was observed downstream of an important paper mill effluent which induces a significant increase of temperature and of nitrite and sulphate concentrations. The presence of two lakes along the Warche course induces downstream either a restoration of the water quality during a mixing period of the lake or an increase of ammonium and phosphate concentrations after water stratification as a result of a temperature gradient in the lake.																			0028-2960						1997	47	1					111	124																WOS:A1997WT26900011
J	Ofoezie, IE; Asaolu, SO				Ofoezie, IE; Asaolu, SO			Water level regulation and control of schistosomiasis transmission: a case study in Oyan Reservoir, Ogun State, Nigeria	BULLETIN OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION												The effect of different water discharge patterns from the artificial Oyan Reservoir in Ogun State, Nigeria, on water level fluctuations and on schistosomiasis transmission was investigated between August 1990 and March 1993 to determine the impact of water level regulation on schistosomiasis transmission and control. The results show that transmission was greatly influenced by the pattern of water discharge during the hot dry season (January-April). A high discharge during this period of no rainfall, high temperatures, and intense sunshine stimulated rapid water level fluctuations and lake draw-down, which led to significant reductions in all indices of schistosomiasis transmission, i.e. snail density, snail infection rates, human water contact patterns, and incidence of infection. Although these results support continuous water discharges from the reservoir during the hot dry season, this may run counter to current water management policies. Further investigation is therefore required to harmonize the potential benefits in this type of discharge pattern with the objectives of efficient water management in artificial reservoirs.																			0042-9686						1997	75	5					435	441											9447776					WOS:000071075000005

Ten sediment traps were placed out along the metropolis-affected fresh water outflow of Lake Malaren, out through a non-tidal estuarine-like region with a low salt content, through the Stockholm archipelago to the Baltic. The metal concentrations of the particles were analysed with AAS using the flame technique and the amounts of C and N were determined with elemental analysis (CHN). The flux of particulate matter and of all metals decreased rapidly outwards in a gradient from the innermost stations. The distribution and composition of the particles were dominated by variations in the runoff from Lake Malaren and by the seasonal dependence on primary production. However, they were also influenced locally by the supply of nutrients via water treatment plant effluents and probably by the special sedimentation conditions in the mixing zones and by resuspension. The concentrations of Cu, Hg, Pb and Cd in the interior of the area under investigation were the most elevated of the elements and decreased markedly further out in the archipelago, indicating local anthropogenic input. Zn, Cr and Fe also showed signs of supply from the urbanized environment. The flux of most of the metals studied displayed both spatial and seasonal correlation with the weight (TPM) of the material, whereas seasonal variation of Cd was correlated to its volume (TPV) and concentration of organic matter (POM, PC and PN).																			0269-7491						1994	85	3					243	257		10.1016/0269-7491(94)90045-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0269-7491(94)90045-0								15091654					WOS:A1994NN65900002

Over 90% of the cladocerans had attached diatoms immediately following ice thaw, when the lakes were not yet thermally stratified, surface water temperatures were low (10-15-degrees-C) and water transparency was at its annual high. Mean maximum density of diatoms on cladocerans averaged among lakes at this time was 3000 cells animal-1. The dominant epizoic diatom was Synedra cyclopum Brutschy, which was found most often on large, pelagic Daphnia pulicaria and Daphnia galeata mendotae. Heavily infested animals had diatoms concentrated on the second antennae and anterior ventral margin of the carapace. Animals with <5 epizoic diatoms were more likely to have cells attached to the postabdomen or tail spine. In addition to living epizoically, S.cyclopum was found free living in the plankton, exhibiting temporal fluctuations in densities similar to epizoic counterparts. However, the densities of the free-living cells seldom exceeded epizoic densities, suggesting that S.cyclopum is adapted for growth on motile cladoceran substrates.

The phyto- and zooplankton monitonng, carried out in 1990 is the first concerted programme covering the 1000 km long reach of the river below Lake Constance. Seasonal observations at 20 fixed stations along the river were carried out by different institutes; this required calibration of methods. In the upper Rhine the sparse population of phytoplankton (< 5 mug chlorophyll-a l-1) was dominated by various groups of algae,i.e. Cryptophyceae, Bacillariophyceae, Chlorophyceae and Cyanophyceae. Downstream, the phytoplankton density increased gradually, while Bacillariophyceae tended to dominate. The high densities found in the lower R. Rhine represented only a few species of centric Bacillariophyceae and Chlorophyceae. The dense blooms of phytoplankton in the lower R. Rhine am triggered by the input of phytoplankton from the upper reaches and tributaries, and are stimulated by large inputs of nutrients. These blooms are accompanied by blooms of zooplankton, especially rotifers, Dreissena polymorpha larvae and, in the lower Rhine, nauplii larvae. The species composition and biomass of plankton in the R. Rhine vary strongly during the year but also between years, as indicated for the period 1980-1990. However, the information at the species level needs further elaboration to allow interpretation of long-term trends. Notably, the input by tributaries should be included. To assess these long-term trends we recommend supplementing the large-scale biological inventory, as planned for the years 1995 and 2000, with plankton observations in the years between and investigating the relationship between the benthic and pelagic communities of the river.					van Steveninck, Erik/M-7540-2013														0273-1223						1994	29	3					9	19		10.2166/wst.1994.0051	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.1994.0051													WOS:A1994NU83300003

Because of the absence of mineral soils, ion exchange and accretion in biomass are the major internal processes governing cation accumulation in peatlands. It is widely believed that peatlands have a large capacity to store cations, and thus to affect the acidity of surface waters. A long-term record of hydrologic and chemical inputs and outputs to the S-2 peatland in the Marcell Experimental Forest was used to construct annual and monthly mass balances for the four major cations. Bulk deposition and throughfall measurements suggest that deposition of Na, Ca and Mg has increased over the period 1971-1984; wet-only and dry bucket measurements do not show such a change. Seasonal and annual variations in cation inputs are not visible in the cation export from the peatland because the large cation reservoir on exchange sites in peat buffers the surface waters and prevents them from responding rapidly to changing inputs. Nevertheless, ion exchange represents a relatively minor source of acidity to this peatland, and accumulation of cations in woody biomass accounts for the majority of the cation retention. The major mechanism of retention in the peatland is different for each cation; accumulation in woody biomass is most important for Ca, storage on ion exchange sites in peat is most important for Mg, green plant tissues are the dominant site of K storage, and Na is bound by unknown mechanisms in the peat. Retention efficiencies show large annual variations but average 50% for Ca, 22% for Mg, 29-44% for Na, and 21% for K.

An earthquake of magnitude 5.3 (Ms) took place on 14 November 1981 along the most active part of the E-W Kalabsha fault beneath the Kalabsha bay (the largest bay of the lake). This earthquake was followed by a tremendous number of smaller events that continue till now. A radio-telemetry network of 13 seismic short period stations and a piezometer network of six wells were established around the northern part of the lake. Epicenters were found to cluster around active faults near the lake. The space-time distribution and the relation of the seismicity with the lake water level fluctuations were studied. Six years after flooding the eastern segment of the Kalabsha fault, strong seismicity began following the main shock of 14 November 1981. It occurred four days after the reservoir had reached its seasonal maximum level. The effect of the North African drought (1982 to present) is clearly seen in the reservoir water level. As it decreased and left the most active fault segments uncovered, the activity (Gebel Marawa area) decreased sharply. Also, the shallow activity was found to be more sensitive to rapid discharging than to the filling. This study indicates that geology, topography, lineations in seismicity, offsets in the faults, changes in fault trends and focal mechanisms are closely related. No relation was found between earthquake activity and both-ground water table fluctuations and water temperatures measured in wells located around the Kalabsha area.																			0264-3707						1991	14	1-4					73	85		10.1016/0264-3707(91)90010-C	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0264-3707(91)90010-C													WOS:A1991JE91000009

Clearance rates ranged from < 0.002 to 13 .mu.l individual-1 h -1 depending on type of cell and water temperature. Keratella and Bosmina ingested all foods; they preferred Chlamydomonas but differed in their preferences for other species. Polyarthra ingested only Chlamydomonas and Euglena. Significant direct relationships between clearance rates and temperature were found for Keratella, P. vulgaris and Bosmia feeding on Chlamydomonas and for Keratella feeding on Rhodotorula. The clearance rates of Keratella and Bosmina were inversely related to the concentration of both tracer cells and natural particles (2.5-15-.mu.m ESD). Temperature and food concentrations accounted for 87 and 89% of the seasonal variation in the clearance rates of Keratella and Bosmina. Although there were days and depths when Bosmina or Polyarthra populations dominated community grazing on Chlamydomonas-like cells, Keratella populations accounted for about 80% of the grazing pressure on such cells during the year.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1982	27	5					918	934		10.4319/lo.1982.27.5.0918	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1982.27.5.0918													WOS:A1982PJ17500011

The sagittae were arrowhead shaped and showed development of rostra. Increments in the sagitta were observable until the bases of the rostra but were invisible in the rostra. The asteriscus had an irregular shape with an ambiguous core and notches at the margin. The ambiguous core of the asteriscus led to difficulty in discerning the first increment. The lapilli were round and fan shaped. Increments in the lapilli were distinct from the core to the margin. The daily increment deposition was validated by alizarin complexone treatment, and the increments increased at the rate of 1 day(-1) after hatching. These features suggested that in this species the lapillus is most appropriate for daily increment analysis. The hatching months were estimated based on the lapillus increment counts, and the results showed that this species continuously hatched in the rainy season for 6 months from November to April. The growth trajectory indicated that H. barnardi attains a total length of 50 mm within 4 months of hatching.																			1341-8998					MAY	2006	53	2					143	147		10.1007/s10228-005-0320-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10228-005-0320-4													WOS:000237864900006

The benthic community that developed was sampled over time and compared with the nearby undisturbed bottom community. A consistent succession of functional and adaptive types was observed. Early colonizers-the ostracod Physocypria globula, the naidid oligochaete Vejdovskyella intermedia, and the chironomid, Chironomus plumosus-exceeded their natural bottom abundances by 2-7 .times. within 40 d, but decreased in abundance later. They are small and mobile, live and feed close to the sediment-water interface, and reproduce often. Late colonizers-Limnodrilus spp., Ilyodrilus templetoni, and pisidiid bivalves-reached natural abundances only after several months if at all. They are large, deep infaunal dwellers that grow slowly and reproduce late in life.

Wetland and upland soils in the watershed had comparable concentrations of inorganic P on a per-volume basis, while NH4+-N and organic forms of N and P were higher in the wetland soils. Nitrate concentrations expressed in a per-volume basis were lower in the wetland soils than in the upland soils. The distribution of sediment and nutrients in the wetland was correlated with distance from a small stream flowing through the wetland. Deposition patterns were affected by recent stream channel migrations. The accumulation of nutrients and sediment delivered from the upland to wetland soils was estimated in 2 ways: by calculating the volume of alluvium deposited in low natural levees adjacent to the stream and by estimating nutrient and ash enrichment of histic surface soils farther away from the stream. Although the levees consituted only .apprx. 20% of the wetland surface area, they accounted for 81% of the sediment, 84% of the N and 67% of the P retained by the wetland. The depth of 137Cs in the soil was used to estimate net sedimentation rates. Average annual accumulations over the wetland as a whole were: 2.0 kg sediment m-2 yr-1, 2.6 g P m-2 yr-1 and 12.8 N g m-2 yr-1. Since these values exceeded those published for average annual storage by wetland plants, soil mechanisms were more important than vegetative uptake for long-term nutrient and sediment retention in the White clay Lake [USA] wetland.

Microbiological and Chemical Water Quality of Lake Ohrid and its Tributaries in 2014	ACTA ZOOLOGICA BULGARICA												The microbiological and chemical study was conducted in 2014, with the aim to assess the water quality of Lake Ohrid and its tributaries. The following parameters were studied: number of heterotrophic bacteria, total number of coliform bacteria, enterococci, Escherichia coli, chemical oxygen demand, and ammonia. The presence and composition of the studied microorganisms had spatial and seasonal dynamics depending on the biotic and abiotic factors, the degree of eutrophication and anthropogenic impact. The lake parts, which are far from settlements and river inflows, were classified as pure waters. The worse water quality was registered in the area of Grashnica locality, where relatively high organic and faecal pollution was registered. This part of the lake is under the pressure of communal and industrial waste waters rich with pollutants and nutrients, which originate in the Velgoska River. This river was highly polluted, exclusively faecal pollution. Similar conditions were found in the Cherava River, while the rivers Koselska and Sateska were less polluted. In order to prevent further worsening of the ecological status of Lake Ohrid, certain preventive measures, mainly rehabilitation of the communal waste waters and regular monitoring of the water and sediments, are necessary.																			0324-0770					MAR	2019				13			19	24																WOS:000472245600003

For this purpose, the following physical and chemical parameters were monitored in 2014: concentration of dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand for five days, chemical oxygen demand through KMnO4 consumption, concentration of total nitrogen, and concentration of total phosphorus with bimonthly dynamics. Additionally, microbiological parameters such as heterotrophic bacteria and total number of coliform bacteria, including their seasonal dynamics, were studied. The highest organic and nutrient loading was registered in the Golema River. The results from microbiology indicated organic and faecal pollution of the water in the investigated rivers.																			0324-0770					MAR	2019				13			11	18																WOS:000472245600002

The study also aimed to characterize the demographic structure of the exploited population by fisheries in the reservoir. Toluidine-stained transverse section of otoliths from 322 specimens, collected between November 2015 and January 2017, were analysed to identify the periodicity of annulus formation and to age individuals. Length, weight, sex and sexual maturity stage were recorded. Life history traits were characterized by length-weight and length age relationships. The periodicity of annulus formation was annual, with complete formation of the translucent zone at the beginning of the warm and wet season (June and July). The length-age key has been established and was composed of 9 age classes, ranging from 0 to 8 years old. Males showed positive allometric growth whereas juveniles and females exhibited isometric growth. The study showed an asymptotic standard length of 658 mm and a low growth rate (K = 0.08 year(-1)). The sex ratio was equilibrated, and first maturity of females was at 277 mm standard length. The population was composed of individuals aged 3 years old and older, and 60% of the landings were composed of individuals aged 5 years and older. The growth rate was lower than for Asian and African populations, and the age-length key provided was specific to the studied reservoir. However, some biological traits of the O. niloticus population were similar to those found for other population in the world: (i) formation of an annual annulus during the reproduction period, at the beginning of the warm and wet season like populations from subtropical countries, and (ii) an isometric or a positive allometric growth as seen in populations that were not overexploited and were living in favourable environmental conditions. Therefore, the present study suggests that the O. niloticus population of the NT2 Reservoir was not overexploited at the time of the survey.					; Panfili, Jacques/J-9397-2016; GUILLARD, Jean/A-2577-2011; PANFILI, JACQUES/J-9397-2016	Guillard, Jean/0000-0003-0116-1167; Panfili, Jacques/0000-0003-0504-2384; 													0399-0974	2101-0315				FEB 28	2019	43	1					71	82		10.26028/cybium/2019-431-007	http://dx.doi.org/10.26028/cybium/2019-431-007													WOS:000462099400008

Total phosphorus inputs from the terrestrial watersheds were obtained for two sub inflows by measuring flow rates and phosphorus concentrations. Direct aerial phosphorus fallout was estimated from nearby sites sampled by the Ontario Ministry of the Environment. Pollen fallout on the 88 ha lake surface was measured during the growing season with a series of floating pollen traps. Detailed microscopic examination was made of the slides prepared from the trapped pollen samples. Pollen grain volumes, species identification, frequency and percentage composition were obtained. Phosphorus contents of several species of pollen grains were calculated for pollen collected directly from broad leaf tree flowers and coniferous strobili. in the old growth watershed, hemlock (Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carr.) contributed the largest component of pollen-source Yellow Birch phosphorus to the ecosystem.																									2000	267						168	174																WOS:000088358100032

These errors arise because of the uncertainty associated with individual components of the water balance, particularly the volumes of groundwater inflow and outflow. Coupling the water balance with balances for conservative solutes and environmental isotopes can assist in reducing the size of the error in the mass balance. WSIBal is a computer model that simultaneously solves the coupled mass balances of water, a conservative solute tracer (e.g. chloride) and environmental isotope tracers (e.g. delta H-2, delta O-18). The model can be used to solve for unknown components of the lake water balance, with the coupled environmental isotope tracer balance in WSIBal providing additional model constraints that extend the conventional water and solute balance approach. Features of the model are illustrated by its application to two case studies. The first investigates the effect of pumping on Blue Lake, a deep maar lake located near Mount Gambler in South Australia, which has no surface inflows or outflows, apart from pumping for water supply. The impact on the groundwater components of the lake water balance caused by the pumping is investigated using WSIBal. The second case study examines the seasonal cyclical variations in the composition of Lake Jasper in the D'Entrecasteaux National Park, in the southwest of Western Australia. These simulations are used to constrain the magnitude of the water balance components of the lake, particularly groundwater inflow and outflow.

The ecological status of the zooplankton in relation to prevailing ecological factors and the lakes fishery are discussed. Species composition of the zooplankton community in Lake Naivasha has been remarkably constant since first observations between 1929 and 1931. The community structure and distribution of the zooplankton in the lake varied little from July 1978 to July 1980, however, there was evidence of species succession among the larger zooplankters, especially the cladocerans. In the littoral area zooplankton contribute significantly to the food and production of juvenile fish. There is an absence of fish zooplanktivores in the limnetic area of the lake. Consequently the limnetic zooplankton is not utilised by higher trophic levels.																			0018-8158					DEC 3	1990	208	1-2					131	140		10.1007/BF00008452	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008452													WOS:A1990EX30100017
J	Håkanson, L; Boulion, VV				Håkanson, L; Boulion, VV			Modelling production and biomasses of zoobenthos in lakes	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												This work presents a dynamic model to predict zoobenthos in lakes. The model has been developed within the framework of a more comprehensive lake ecosystem model, LakeWeb, which also accounts for the following functional groups of organisms, phytoplankton, bacterioplankton, two types of zooplankton (herbivorous and predatory), macrophytes, prey fish and predatory fish. This work also presents a new data-base for zoobenthos in lakes. Many of the lakes included in this study are situated in the former Soviet Union. They were investigated during the Soviet period and those results have been largely unknown in the West. Using this data-base, this work also presents new empirical models for zoobenthos. The new dynamic model gives seasonal variations (the calculation time, dt, is 1 week using Euler's method and enough iterations to get stable solutions). The basic aim of the dynamic model is that it should capture general functional and structural patterns in lakes. We have demonstrated by several model tests along limnological gradients (total phosphorus concentrations, pH, lake colour, latitude and lake size) that the dynamic model gives predictions that agree well with the values given by the empirical regressions, and also expected and requested divergences from these regressions when they do not provide sufficient resolution. It would have been very difficult indeed to carry out such tests regarding ecosystem responses using traditional methods with extensive field studies in a few lakes. We have given algorithms for (1) production of zoobenthos from eating macrophytes, benthic algae and sediments, (2) elimination ( related to the turnover time of zooplankton), and (3) zoobenthos consumption by prey fish, and the factors influencing these processes/rates. The model is driven by data easily accessed from standard monitoring programs or maps a prerequisite for practical utility in contexts of lake management.

At the Atlantic site, Kejimkujik National Park, Nova Scotia (44 degrees 22'N, 65 degrees 12'W), the concentration ranges were <0.002-0.13, 0.2-26, and <0.2-10 mu g m(-3) for MSA, nss SO4=, and SO,, respectively, and the annual means were 0.02, 2.2, and 1.3 mu g m(-3). MSA had a monthly median peak of 0.036 mu g m(-3) in June, versus an SO2 peak of 2.7 mu g m(-3) in February, and no discernible nss SO4= seasonal peak. The MSA/nss SO4= ratios were low compared to ratios in other parts of the world but exhibited a seasonality dominated by that in MSA. At the midcontinental site, Experimental Lake Area, Ontario (49 degrees 39'N, 93 degrees 43'W), the concentrations were usually lower than at the coastal sites. The ranges were <0.002-0.066, 0.04-12.5, and <0.16-16.6 mu g m(-3) for MSA, nss SO4=, and SO2, respectively, and the annual means were 0.01, 1.6, and 0.93 mu g m(-3). The monthly median seasonal peaks at this site were 0.01 mu g m(-3) for MSA in September, 2.1 mu g m for nss SO4= in March, and 2.8 mu g m(-3) for SO2 in January. The MSA/nss SO4= ratio at this site was similar to that found at Kejimkujik. At Saturna Island, British Columbia (48 degrees 47'N, 123 degrees 08'W), the ranges were 0.002-0.2, 0.14-6.4, and 0.12-21 mu g m(-3) for MSA, nss SO4=, and SO2, respectively, and the annual means were 0.06, 1.1, and 3.0 mu g m(-3). The monthly median peaks were 0.12 mu g m(-3) for MSA in August, 5 mu g m(-3) for SO2 in February, and a m nominal peak of 1.5 mu g m(-3) for nss SO4= in August. The MSA/nss SO4= ratio had a seasonal pattern dominated by that of MSA with a peak of 0.1 in August. These data should enhance the existing databases for testing global sulfur models.

Muggelsee (mean depth 4.85 mp, area 7.12 km2) was calculated from weekly measurements of nitrogen transformations from 1978 to 1984. Common mass balances for nitrogen were completed by determination of dinitrogen fixation in order to calculate denitrification as residual budget component and resolved for distinct seasonal periods. N sedimentation was calculated from internal P balance. Influence of flushing rate on loss processes were analysed by comparison of years with very different runoff. Time series analyses and multiple comparison show a relation of hydraulic flow, nitrate load, in-lake nitrate and N elimination to the seasonal cycle of irradiance. Denitrification is the most important loss process and exceeds the effect of sedimentation. Other in- and outputs (precipitation, swimmers, volatilization) are rather stochastic and of lower quantitative importance. Nitrate leaching from the catchment and turbulent mixing within the lake are discussed as determining factors of in-lake nitrogen fluxes.																			0020-9309						1992	77	1					43	72		10.1002/iroh.19920770105	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19920770105													WOS:A1992HQ98300004
J	Aylward, B; Echeverría, J				Aylward, B; Echeverría, J			Synergies between livestock production and hydrological function in Arenal, Costa Rica	ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS												Conventional wisdom amongst environmentalists holds that the cutting of tropical forest for livestock production is not only bad business but also bad for the environment. In particular, it is thought that conversion to pasture leads to a rise in the sedimentation of waterways and reservoirs, an increase in flooding and loss of dry season water supply. Using the case of the Rio Chiquito, watershed (which drains into Lake Arenal, Costa Rica), the paper questions this conventional wisdom. The paper demonstrates that both livestock production and the associated downstream hydrological impacts represent important values to the local economy; values that significantly outweigh expected returns from options for reforestation or forest regeneration. Given that non-hydrological externalities associated with livestock production are expected to be of minimal importance in the watershed, there is little reason - as is often proposed - to foster large-scale reforestation of the watershed or to purchase land for protection, Instead efforts should focus on how to maximize the complementary returns from livestock and the support to hydroelectric power provided by water production.																			1355-770X					JUL	2001	6		3				359	381		10.1017/S1355770X01000201	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1355770X01000201													WOS:000170148900004
J	Rodgers, JA; Smith, HT; Thayer, DD				Rodgers, JA; Smith, HT; Thayer, DD			Integrating nonindigenous aquatic plant control with protection of snail kite nests in Florida	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The endangered snail kite (Rostrhamus sociabilis) feeds primarily on the freshwater apple snail (Pomacea paludosa) in Florida. The nonindigenous, floating water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) and water lettuce (Pistia stratiotes) impede kites from finding snails. Effective control of these aquatic plants in the littoral zone of central and south Florida lakes benefits kites by maintaining open foraging habitat. However, incidental herbicide Spraying of nesting substrates result in nest collapse when kites breed in nonwoody, emergent plants [cattail (Typha sop.) and giant bulrush (Scirpus validus)] in the outer littoral zone during lower lake levels. Many endangered species recovery plans and their implementation have experienced problems due to inaction and/or noncooperation by various governmental agencies and their personnel. Herein, we describe the development and implementation of a buffer zone strategy to prevent secondary impacts from an aquatic plant control program to snail kites nesting on lakes in central and south Florida. A strategy was jointly developed by personnel of five state and federal agencies to control herbicide application near kite nesting areas during the normal breeding season. Although requiring various modifications during its implementation; this cooperative effort successfully integrated aquatic plant central objectives with snail kite conservation on Lake Okeechobee during 1988. The program was expanded the following year to lakes Kissimmee and Tohopekaliga. Since the implementation of the snail kite impact preclusion program, no nest loss was attributed to incidental herbicide applications on lakes Okeechobee, Kissimmee, and Tohopekaliga.																			0364-152X					JUL	2001	28	1					31	37		10.1007/s002670010204	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s002670010204								11436998					WOS:000169270300004

Active cells can be detected under the microscope by the presence of an intact electron transport system able to reduce the colourless INT [2-(p-iodophenyl)-3-(p-nitrophenyl)-5-phenyl tetrazolium chloride] to an optically dense intracellular deposit. An improvement of this method has been applied to Lake Geneva and to a fish pond in the Ivory Coast. The portion of INT-reducing bacterial cells ranged from 1 to 71%, depending on place, depth, season and time of the day. In all cases bacterial activity, determined by uptake of H-3 Thymidine or C-14 glucose, and frequency of dividing cells were better correlated with the number of INT-reducing cells than with the total number of cells. This means that counts of cells able to reduce INT have a better metabolic significance than total cell counts. Some examples are developed which show the advantages of applying this method in cases where it is useful to distinguish active cells in a bacterial assemblage.

Evaluation of Coded Wire Tag Loss in Brook Trout Tagged Using Automated Methods	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Automated coded-wire-tagging methods were recently applied to Brook Trout Salvelinus fontinalis for the first time, but information on tag loss and method efficiency is needed. We observed tag loss in Brook Trout over 210 d posttagging to determine the degree of tag loss and when tag loss stabilized for the 2015 year-class. We also evaluated tag loss from two subsequent year-classes. Brook Trout tag loss stabilized (i.e., reached the curve's inflection point) at 1.5% after 15 d posttagging and achieved its asymptotic maximum of 1.6% after 28 d. Tag loss rates for subsequent year-classes were 1.7% and 2.3%. We also described throughput (fish tagged per hour) to evaluate method efficiency. Throughput ranged from 8,449 to 9,395 fish/h for Brook Trout and was comparable to observations on other salmonines; combined with the low rate of tag loss, this demonstrates the efficacy of automated methods for the marking and tagging of this species. In addition, rapid stabilization of tag loss in Brook Trout (15 d) was similar to that observed in Pacific salmonines but distinct from that recorded for other Salvelinus spp. (>= 150 d), and underscored the need to directly measure species-specific tag loss and its stabilization period and to avoid using closely related species as proxies.

Concentrations of TP and total organic matter were higher in July than in October. Concentrations of NH4+-N decreased and NO3--N increased from July to October. The relative composition of total nitrogen (TN) and its concentration were strongly dependent on the type of watershed: the lowest TN concentrations were observed in lakes with forested watersheds, increasing above the timberline and reaching maximum values in acidified lakes with rocky watersheds. In the pool of TN, nitrate was most important in lakes above the timberline (70-86% of TN), and organic nitrogen in forest lakes (> 90% of TN).

J	LEWIS, MA; HAMM, BG				LEWIS, MA; HAMM, BG			ENVIRONMENTAL MODIFICATION OF THE PHOTOSYNTHETIC RESPONSE OF LAKE PLANKTON TO SURFACTANTS AND SIGNIFICANCE TO A LABORATORY FIELD COMPARISON	WATER RESEARCH												The toxic effects of nine surfactants on the short-term photosynthetic activity of lake plankton and factors affecting the response were investigated in multiple monthly studies conducted during May-October. The impact of the detergent chemicals on photosynthesis differed with the mean 3 h EC50 values ranging from 0.6 to 28.7 mg l-1. The photosynthetic response to the same surfactant varied as much as 80.times., attributed in part to monthly changes in water temperature (range = 17-28.degree. C) and to seasonal differences in phytoplankton composition. Overall, the test chemicals were less toxic during periods of lower water temperature, diatom dominance and low algal density. The in situ photosynthesis results were compared to those from standard algal laboratory toxicity tests to assess the environmental relevance of a laboratory data base. These 96 h tests were conducted with the same surfactants but monitored growth effects on three cultured algae. Based on this comparison, the laboratory effect concentrations were typically either similar to or lower than those in the field. Key considerations in this laboratory-field comparison were the environmental modification of the photosynthetic response, the surfactant type, and the differential sensitivities of the cultured laboratory algae.																			0043-1354	1879-2448					1986	20	12					1575	1582		10.1016/0043-1354(86)90123-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(86)90123-5													WOS:A1986F518000016
J	Nawaz, S; Kirk, KL				Nawaz, S; Kirk, KL			Temperature effects on bioconcentration of DDE by Daphnia	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Lake temperatures vary with season, latitude, elevation and as a result of thermal pollution. Ln addition, lake temperatures may increase with global warming. Radiotracer experiments were conducted to determine the effects of temperature on the bioaccumulation of lipophilic organic contaminants by zooplankton. Daphnia pulex were exposed to C-14-labelled DDE, a stable metabolite of the organochlorine pesticide DDT, in particle-free water for 24 h. An increase in temperature from 5 to 25 degrees C resulted in a 314% increase in bioconcentration factor (the ratio of contaminant concentration in the organism to contaminant concentration in the water). 2. To mimic the fluctuating temperatures experienced by zooplankton during diel vertical migration, we conducted experiments in which animals were exposed to 25 degrees C for 12 h in the light, then 15 degrees C for 12 h in the dark. Exposure to this fluctuating temperature regime for 48h resulted in a 27-33% increase in bioconcentration factor relative to a constant 20 degrees C control. 3. Live animals accumulated more than twice the amount of DDE than freshly killed animals, indicating that the activity of the organism is important in bioconcentration. This finding sheds light on the possible mechanisms for the increase in bioconcentration at higher constant temperatures. Daphnia pump more water through their branchial chambers at higher temperatures. Thus, if the thoracic limbs are an important site of contaminant uptake, then animals are exposed to more contaminant molecules at higher temperatures. Other possible mechanisms include changes in the thickness of the diffusive boundary layer and changes in cell membrane permeability.																			0046-5070					FEB	1996	35	1					173	178		10.1046/j.1365-2427.1996.00472.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.1996.00472.x													WOS:A1996TW36600015

The seasonal mean of zooplankton lipid concentration for each lake was between 9 and 16% of dry weight, and non-polar lipids were always <50% of total lipid, except for a brief period in Lake Ontario. In the smaller lakes, zooplankton biomass (r(2) = 0.37, P = 0.001), but not zooplankton lipid concentration, was related to edible (<60 mu m) phytoplankton biomass and total phytoplankton biomass. Zooplankton lipid was neither related to primary production nor lipid production; however, the seasonal mean of lipid concentration was related to the seasonal mean of chlorophyll a-specific primary production (assimilation number) (r(2) = 0.96, P = 0.020) and lipid assimilation number (r(2) = 0.94, P = 0.033). The lipid concentration of the zooplankton community and the nonpolar fraction of that lipid were somewhat lower than expected from the literature on individual species of zooplankton.																			0142-7873					NOV	1993	15	11					1319	1332		10.1093/plankt/15.11.1319	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/15.11.1319													WOS:A1993MH23800008

In general, since the 1960s, cold season (October and January) precipitation has been decreasing, temperatures have been rising, snow water equivalents have been diminishing, and streamflows have been going down.

J	LYNCH, M				LYNCH, M			THE LIMITS TO LIFE-HISTORY EVOLUTION IN DAPHNIA	EVOLUTION												Using quantitative genetic techniques, the components of phenotypic variance and covariance for fitness traits were periodically determined for an intermittent population of D. pulex and applied to phenotypic selection models to determine the limits to the response to selection. Levels of expressed genetic variance in this population are extremely high early in the year as a consequence of the release of hidden genetic variance via sex in the previous year. Less than 25 generations of continuous clonal selection are required to depress the expressed genetic variance to levels expected under obligate parthenogenesis. A minimum of 10-20% selective mortality per generation is required to account for this erosion in genetic variance. Since D. pulex populations generally consist of several closely related clonal groups that are distinct with respect to both phenotypic means and genetic covariance structure, selection between groups supplements clonal selection within groups as a mechanism for phenotypic evolution. Of particular interest in the study population is the coexistence of an obligately unisexual race with 2 cyclically parthenogenetic clonal groups. Despite the fact that nearly all members of the obligately unisexual race are electrophoretically identical, it contains substantial genetic variance for polygenic characters and clearly does not constitute an evolutionary dead end. Rates of phenotypic evolution in excess of .apprx. 2% of the mean phenotype/generation are unlikely to occur in most cladoceran populations, especially those that have forgone sex for more than a few generations, without a substantial reduction in population size. This rules out the possibility of close tracking of seasonal variation in optimal phenotypes by clonal selection, and provides an evolutionary genetic explanation for the widespread use of cyclomorphosis in cladocerans and for the extreme sensitivity of lake plankton communities to novel perturbations. Populations that exhibit the greatest degree of evolutionary stability because of a lack of sex will also experience the most dramatic responses to selection following a rare recombinational event because the amount of hidden genetic variance converted to expressed genetic variance is proportional to the time between sexual phases.																			0014-3820	1558-5646					1984	38	3					465	482		10.2307/2408697	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2408697								28555980					WOS:A1984SV19300001
J	Knowlton, MF; Jones, JR				Knowlton, MF; Jones, JR			Fecal bacteria, nutrients, chlorophyll, and dissolved oxwen in a constructed habitat wetland receiving effluent and treated municipal river water	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												The Eagle Bluffs Conservation Area(Eagle Bluffs) in central Missouri includes about 400 ha of floodable pools and channels managed as seasonal or permanent habitat wetlands using treated municipal effluent from the Columbia Wastewater Treatment Wetland. Effluent, which is used year around, provides about half the annual water input and is supplemented during waterfowl migrations by pumping from the adjacent Missouri River. Infiltration rates are high (approximate to900 cm . yr(-1)) because of high soil permeability. Water quality of inflows and selected pools and channels on Eagle Bluffs has been monitored since wetland flooding began in 1994 because of concerns about possible negative effects of wastewater and interest in the dynamics of nutrients and algal biomass in the system. Compared to river water, effluent typically had high concentrations of fecal bacteria, chloride, dissolved phosphorus, and dissolved nitrogen, especially ammonia-N. In the water Distribution Channel (DC) and terminal wetland pools of Eagle Bluffs fecal bacteria decline rapidly and are usually within the range suitable for human water contact (<200 cells 100 mL(-1)). Phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations vary with the relative inputs of effluent and river water and in situ losses. On the basis of comparison with chloride concentrations, over half of incoming phosphorus and nitrogen are lost from surface water to sediments, plant uptake or denitrification. Nutrient losses from the large proportion of water lost to infiltration are not known. Chlorophyll concentrations in the DC and wetland pools exceeded 100 mug . L-1 in 35% of observations, but chlorophyll and organic matter concentrations on Eagle Bluffs are similar to those in Missouri River oxbow lakes with much lower nutrient inputs. Ammonia concentration frequently exceed USEPA acute and chronic toxicity criteria, but fish seem to thrive on Eagle Bluffs. Overall, negative effects of effluent use seem minimal with respect to intended uses of the habitat wetland, but effects of infiltrating effluent on subsurface drinking water supplies are still in question.																			1040-2381	2151-5530				JUN	2003	19	2					171	183		10.1080/07438140309354083	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438140309354083													WOS:000184887600009

The spawning season occurred between mid June and early September with veliger densities peaking at 30,000/m(3) in late June. Veligers first appeared at a water temperature of 21 degrees C. When spawning ended in September Phe water temperature was 22 degrees C. Veligers were found throughout November when the water temperature was 10 degrees C. The lowest temperature at which veligers were observed was 7 degrees C in March 1996. These results show that the zebra mussels in the lower Ohio River are reproducing naturally and that spawning appears to be synchronous. The presence of larvae at low temperatures in March suggests that veligers are capable of delaying settlement and overwintering in the planktonic stage.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				SEP	1998	13	3					255	261		10.1080/02705060.1998.9663617	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1998.9663617													WOS:000076042500001

To develop models specifically applicable to nutrient-poor Canadian Shield lakes, a variety of morphometric, chemical, and planktonic parameters were assessed for three consecutive years from 16 Canadian Shield lakes in south-contral Ontario. Total nitrogen was the best univariate predictor of zooplankton biomass for data averaged over single ice-free seasons, but total phosphorus was the best predictor when data were averaged over the entire study period. Consideration of pH and maximum depth improved certain models. Total phosphorus is clearly a good predictor of (long-term) average zooplankton biomass in nutrient-poor lakes as it is in lakes exhibiting a wide range in trophic state.

Water samples collected from Razzaza Lake were filtered and acidified with 5 ml concentrated nitric acid. Sediment samples and liver, muscle and gill samples were dissolved in the microwave by adding 1 ml of concentrated perchloric acid and 7 ml of concentrated nitric acid. Heavy metal levels in water, sediment and fish tissue samples were measured with ICP-MS instrument. Hg was not detected in lake water, sediment and fish tissues. Cd was not detected only in lake water. Among the metals, the highest concentrations in water, sediment and tissue samples were found for Al. The heavy metal levels detected in the Razzaza Lake water were below the permissible levels of heavy metals in the aquatic environment. According to Sedimanter quality guidelines, the Razzaza Lake sediment had the lowest effective concentration for As, Cu, Pb, Hg and Zn, high effective concentration for Cd and Ni. In the Razzaza Lake, heavy metal accumulation order has been identified as sediment> fish (liver> gill> muscle tissue)> lake water. Pb levels in all tissues and Ni levels in the gills of Ctenopharyngodon idella were above the permissible levels recommended by FAO and Turkish legislation. The present study shows that the metals level in muscle of Cyprinus carpio and Barbus grypus species did not exceed permissible levels recommended by FAO and Turkish legislation and these fish are considered safe for human consumption. But, the consumption of Ctenopharyngodon idella which is exposed to more heavy metals due to high consumption of grass should be restricted for human health.																			1018-4619	1610-2304					2019	28	7					5041	5051																WOS:000477688700002

HYDROACOUSTIC EVALUATION OF THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL DISTRIBUTION OF FISH IN THE UPSTREAM PROXIMITY OF A DAM IN A NEOTROPICAL RESERVOIR	ACTA ICHTHYOLOGICA ET PISCATORIA												Background. Construction of dams alters the physical, chemical, and ecological characteristics of the aquatic environment and modifies fish behaviour and the community composition. Few studies have shown the diel and seasonal fish distribution in tropical reservoirs, mainly in the proximity of the dam, where the risk of injury and death of fishes, which try to migrate downstream, is high. Thus, the data obtained in these regions can encourage actions that may attenuate the impacts on ichthyofauna. Hydroacoustic sampling is an effective tool to study fish behaviour and their spatial distribution in water bodies. In this context, the aim of this study was to evaluate the spatial and seasonal distribution of fish in the reservoir of Tres Marias (Minas Gerais, Brazil), immediately upstream of the dam, using hydroacoustic and gillnet sampling. Material and methods. Hydroacoustics and gillnet sampling were carried out both during the day and at night, and during the rainy and dry seasons. For the acquisition of hydroacoustic data, we employed an echosounder (BioSonics DT-X Digital Scientific) with a split-beam digital transducer. For the biological data, gillnets of different mesh sizes were set. Results. Hydroacoustic data showed significant differences in fish depth between day and night surveys, with fish remaining in deeper water during the day, a phenomenon known as Diel Vertical Migration. Furthermore, hydroacoustic data showed that smaller fish (estimated by "target strength") concentrate at smaller depths. There was no significant difference in the size of fish between seasons. Limnological and operation variables were not related to the fish abundance. Distribution maps showed that during the day fishes were distributed in areas more distant from the dam, while at night they were closer to the dam. Gillnets sampled 127 individuals of 22 species and 57.5% of the collected specimens were migratory species. Conclusion. These results can contribute to the understanding of fish behaviour in reservoirs, as well as provide an empirical basis for the development of novel fish management measures for Neotropical dams.

The demand for bathing sites is growing. However, in many German rivers as the Ruhr River, bathing has been prohibited for decades. At Lake Baldeney, an impounded lake of the Ruhr River, located in a densely populated area in North-Rhine-Westphalia, the first bathing place was opened in 2017. Receiving water from combined sewer overflows during heavy rain events, the hygienic quality of the water body could be affected. Due to that an extensive monitoring programme of quality parameters along the Ruhr River has been carried out during the last years and an early warning system has been established to assure a safe bathing environment at all times in a previous research project. In this article highly resolved precipitation data from six rain gauges, overflow data from four combined sewer overflow (CSO) tanks and one storage sewer as well as flow data from the River Ruhr was analysed together with daily measurements of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and intestinal enterococci (Int. E.) to assess the prediction capacity of hygienic contaminations at the bathing site during three swimming seasons. Data evaluation showed a good predictive capability of precipitation data. Overflow data showed less predictive performance when using overflow information from one tank only, indicating that single overflow events not necessarily lead to hygienic contaminations above critical thresholds.

In the stratified lake, the upper (epilimnion) and deep (hypolimnion) layers are distinguished, in which the density gradients are small. Between them is a layer of water (metalimnion), within which the density gradient is great. In the near-bottom layer, hydrogen sulphide accumulates and there is no oxygen. One-dimensional mathematical models are used to determine the dynamics of the vertical thermohaline structure of the salt lake Uchum. Two periods in the annual regime are considered: the period of the absence of the ice cover (IC) and the period with the existence of the IC.

A test of three competing hypotheses	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Common reed Phragmites australis is the dominant vascular plant species of the shorelines of the Gippsland Lakes, south-eastern Australia. Although substantial declines have been reported for over 50 years, with increasing salinity posited as the cause, P. australis still occurs around the Gippsland Lakes, including in environments with near-oceanic salinities. The occurrence of P. australis in highly saline environments cannot be explained in terms of either seasonal variations in surface water salinity or a freshwater subsidy provided by intrusions of non-saline groundwater into the root zone. An experimental growth trial with plants of different provenance showed that P. australis grew vigorously even at 8-16PSU (with maximum aboveground biomass at 2-4PSU). There was some evidence that specimens from saltier sites were more salt tolerant than those from fresher sites. The selection of salt-tolerant strains is the most likely explanation for the occurrence of P. australis in saline sites. However, anthropogenic salinisation is unlikely to be the only factor involved in the historical loss of reed beds, and lower and more stable water levels following the permanent opening of the Gippsland Lakes to the ocean in 1889 are probably also contributing factors.																			1323-1650	1448-6059					2019	70	4					469	492		10.1071/MF18145	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF18145													WOS:000462534200002

A general evaluation related to trammel net fishermen in Lake Van district was done; accordingly, it was found out that 85% of them are from Van, while 15% of them are from Bitlis. The average number of crews for vessels was 2.34 +/- 0, 77, and the average for the age of fisherman was found out as 40,14 +/- 11, 37, respectively. The results of the education level items in the survey highlight that 62% of the fisherman graduated from primary school; 23% of them graduated from secondary school; 13% of them graduated from high school, and only 2% of them graduated from university. Regarding the marital status and their belongings, it was found out that 84% of the fishermen were found out to be married. By the time they were asked how they started this job, 29% of them claimed that they had a passion for lake, 26% of them preferred because of his father's occupation choices, and 45% of them preferred it because they were obligated to do this job. 55% of the participant fishermen pointed out that they wanted to give up this job, and 90% of them highlighted that they did not want their children to this job. According to the results, it was also found out that all of the fishermen had a second job. Particularly, when the season is closed, most of them work in building constructions as well as dealing with agriculture or animal husbandry. Last but not the least, the most important problems were identified as illegal fishing, gaining less money than expected with the fishery and the deficiency of port problems. Finally, this study is expected to shed light onto solutions of the abovementioned problems.

J	Dimelisová, E				Dimelisova, Eleni			Possibilities and limits in the management of mountain watersheds: Lessons from the Maya civilization	LAND USE POLICY												This study focused on three pre-Columbian centres of the Maya society: Kaminaljuyu, Copan and Tikal. Historical method was used to compare their development in relation to the hydrological regime. Kaminaljuyu is based on a catchment-lake relationship, Copan on a downstream impact of a large mountain watershed, and Tikal represents an upland settlement based on a headwater spot. The main aim is to analyse water management of these centres, particularly, in view of their rise and collapse. Selected ancient Maya centres used very sophisticated water management systems with several signs of environmental and social implications. That water technology ensured their economic prosperity and consolidation of the administrative and political power for a long time. The water supply of the Maya settlement faced a serious impact of seasonal rainfall with relatively long dry periods (4-5 months) as well as fast runoff formation in the karstified bedrock. While in the Copan centre, surrounded by a large mountain watershed, the flood control was the highest priority, headwater located Kaminaljuyu and Tikal concentrated mainly on the harvest and storage of rain water. Later, these centres had to adapt to the increasing population, changing society, environment and landuse. For a long time their water management was able to adapt to the increasing demand of water and decreasing recharge of water resources. The exact reason of the collapse of these Maya centres was probably a superposition of the climate change, overexploitation of natural resources, and exceeding the carrying capacity of their environment. All those societies reached an extremely high level of hydraulic engineering, but, they were still limited in knowledge of hydrology and watershed management. Finally, it was probably a series of extreme droughts leaded to their final collapse.																			0264-8377	1873-5754				JAN	2019	80						415	423		10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.01.026	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.01.026													WOS:000453339200044
J	Dorak, Z				Dorak, Zeynep			A Preliminary Study on Using Rotifera Fauna to Determine The Trophic Level of The Buyukcekmece Reservoir (istanbul, Turkey)	AQUATIC SCIENCES AND ENGINEERING												In this study, the abundance of rotifera fauna, in the Buyukcekmece Reservoir (Istanbul) and some physicochemical features of the reservoir, were investigated between May 2009 and February 2010. In terms of physicochemical conditions, the trophic state of the reservoir was determined as eutrophic (CTSI= 57.8). A total of 33 rotifera species were identified. Keratella cochlearis represented 40.62% of the total annual rotifera present, and was predominant. It was followed by Polyarthra vulgaris (10.14%), Synchaeta oblonga (9.06%), Brachionus urceolaris (5.58%), Pompholyx sulcata (5.21%) and Epiphanes macroura (%4.86), respectively. The contribution of the other rotifer species to the annual presence of rotifera was determined as being 24.52%. The dominance of these species was attributed to the eutrophic state of the reservoir, because K. cochlearis, P vulgaris, B. urceolaris and P. sulcata are known as eutrophication indicator species, due to their saprobic valences. Also, the trophic state of the reservoir was found to be eutrophic according to the Q(B/T) index (= 3). According to the present data about rotifera species, and the abundance of them, the Buyukcekmece Reservoir was specified as eutrophic. However it is necessary to follow the conditions with periodic monitoring to observe the alterations in the Buyukcekmece Reservoir, in this respect the results of the present study would constitute an important baseline for subsequent studies.

C	Gyurkovich, M			IOP	Gyurkovich, Mateusz			Kamien Pomorski - Health Resort on the Waterfront - Transformations of the Public Space of the Town after 1945'	3RD WORLD MULTIDISCIPLINARY CIVIL ENGINEERING, ARCHITECTURE, URBAN PLANNING SYMPOSIUM (WMCAUS 2018)	IOP Conference Series-Materials Science and Engineering				3rd World Multidisciplinary Civil Engineering, Architecture, Urban Planning Symposium (WMCAUS)	JUN 18-22, 2018	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC					Diversity of urban structures in Europe has its sources in cultural distinctness of different regions, in different pace of their development over millennia Methods of designing towns in subsequent urbanisation periods differed. Nevertheless, frequently older structures were adapted to new needs. The question concerning the ideal of the European city remains open - is impossible to define one dominating spatial model encountered everywhere, despite attempts of ancient powers (Imperium Romanum), and by 20th -century totalitarian systems. The latter largely contributed to interruption of continuity of cities' historical development, especially in Central and Eastern Europe. Warfare and scale of destruction of the spatial/social structure in many cities in 1939-1945 were unprecedented in the European history Examples of metropolises practically wiped off from the face of the earth, like Warsaw or Dresden, are common knowledge. This fate was shared by many other towns, especially in the Polish-German borderland. Their reconstruction after the war caused complete transformation of their urban/social structure. The study focuses on Kamien Pomorski, situated on a headland at Kamienski Lake, separated from the Baltic Sea by Wolin island. Before the war it was one of the nicest port towns in Pomerania, with history reaching back to the early Polish state and the clash of Slavic, Scandinavian, and German influences. The town, an episcopal see, bloomed in the medieval and modern times under the Pomeranian, Brandenburgian, and German rule. At the end of the WWII the centre was ruined over several days. Some religious and secular buildings survived. Traditional economic foundations of the local population, moulded for centuries, and the corresponding port structure, were nearly completely destroyed. Almost complete replacement of the local community, not fully grasping the local spatial, natural and landscape conditions, was connected with introduction of centrally planned socialist economy. The town changed its character, despite maintaining and developing some of its previous functions (e.g. health resort). Kamien Pomorski was reconstructed in forms not corresponding to traditional ones (prefabricated blocks of flats), although respecting previous transport/urban layout, which is an advantage. There were attempts to restore the most important preserved monuments -cathedral, town hall, several sections of city walls. In time these efforts brought the expected effect. In recent years several investments were implemented, referring to historical spatial layouts, following the rules of retroversion and revealing some relics. The port function was restored - predominantly as a recreational yacht and water sports marina, popular in high season. Some waterfront boulevards were renovated. Promenades are being built, the spa park is to be revitalised. To conclude, it should be stated that improvement of public spaces is observable in Kamien Pomorski, just like in its green areas and waterfront edge. Renovations of pre-war tenements and villas and growing abundance of services activating the public domain cannot be disregarded. It seems that despite enormous war destructions, which changed the appearance of the town forever, after many decades Kamien Pomorski has become vivid again.

Characterising the Hydrological Regime of a Tropical Papyrus Wetland in the Lake Kyoga Basin, Uganda	AGRICULTURE AND ECOSYSTEM RESILIENCE IN SUB SAHARAN AFRICA: LIVELIHOOD PATHWAYS UNDER CHANGING CLIMATE	Climate Change Management											Papyrus wetlands are predominant in permanently flooded areas of Sub-Saharan Africa, covering approximately 40,000 km(2) in East and Central Africa. Previous studies have quantified and valued ecosystem services of these wetlands, but there is still a need to understand the key processes of the wetlands' hydrology. The study objective was to quantify the seasonal variations in water balance and retention time of a papyrus wetland section. Discharge measurements were carried out to quantify channel flow in upstream and downstream parts of the wetland section. Groundwater fluxes were estimated using borehole triangulation of groundwater levels, while precipitation and other climatic variables for estimating evapotranspiration were monitored using an automatic weather station located 1 km from the study site. The retention time of the wetland section was estimated from tracer experiments and by calculating the volume-discharge ratio. Results show that the water balance of the section is dominated by wetland channel flow, contributing approximately 99.7% of the total inputs, while precipitation and groundwater discharge contribute approximately 0.2% and <0.1%, respectively. Estimated retention time varied between 2 hours and 7 days during periods of high and low flows, respectively. The groundwater gradient showed flow towards the wetland throughout the monitoring period, with average gradients of 0.0074 and 0.0043 on the western and eastern edges of the wetland, respectively. Since wetland channel flow is dominant, the wetland's hydrology is vulnerable to land cover changes and resultant changes in surface runoff from the upstream catchment. Further research on impacts of land use changes within the upstream catchment on wetland channel flow is recommended.

This accelerated warming of northern regions is associated with multiple climate feedbacks, including those linked to the mobilization of old organic carbon previously sequestered in the frozen ground. This critical climate-feedback mechanism has major uncertainties, and may respond nonlinearly to ongoing warming at high latitudes. This study examines the role of freshwater ecosystems in the subarctic carbon balance, and addresses some sources of nonlinearity in the effect of climate warming on these ecosystems. Specifically, I examine the CO2 and CH4 dynamics in permafrost thaw-related ecosystems, and the associated biogeochemical processes. Our results show that major sources of variation in the dynamics of these two gases are associated with the geomorphological properties of the landscape, the degree of ground warming and seasonal biogeochemical dynamics. Accelerated climate change in northern regions may also intensify the CO2 and CH4 cycles in these regions, and may substantially increase the current CH4 flux from these ecosystems.

In order to overcome a huge computational cost for a prolonged analysis over an extensive area, the General-Purpose computing on Graphics Processing Units (GPGPU) technology is applied to the model. The developed model is applied to a solution of seasonal inundation process for the 154 days in 2002. Calculated result is compared with observational data and satellite remote sensing. It is found that the developed model seems to successfully reproduce reasonable progress/regress of inundation. A breakdown of the total elapsed time for the numerical analysis is considered in a detail. It is found that the GPGPU technology can accelerate the solution more than one hundred times faster by employing a simple rectangular mesh and coding to reduce a memory access overhead.

Vale Indonesia operates three hydroelectric power plants: Larona, Balambano and Karebbe. These plants generate 365 megawatts of power that supplies the electricity to operate smelter plant. The presence of hydroelectric plants reduce the need for fuel-based power plants, they are the main initiative energy efficiency program, and significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Hydroelectric using water from Larona River which had a relative high annual debit fluctuation and hence it was necessary to retain the excessive water debit in the rainy season to overcome the deficit of the water in the dry season by constructing three cascade reservoir in the downstream of Towuti lake for hydropower operation. A dam stores water in a reservoir, from which water flows through penstock pipes to-generate electricity. The quantity of electricity produced is determined by the volume of water flow and the height from the top of the turbines to the water surface at the base of the dam. The operation of the reservoir was synergized with Hydropower energy demand. The study come with the idea to managing energy production and planning for maintenance Hydro plan unit and Smelterplant unit with dependable flow projection where is on September and october is the best time to shutdown the unit for maintenance rather than still running to respon demand 295 Mw with additional diesel power generation which is most costly. The results show that the proposed technique is capable of producing better results.					Nasution, Aulia/P-2590-2017	Nasution, Aulia M.

Policy decisions to conserve lakes could be well achieved by data prediction. Modelling by using software could describe the future conditions of lake and give policymakers to legislate the best alternative solution. This research studies Agathis lake characteristics. The lake is situated in Universitas Indonesia, Depok, West Java, Indonesia. The research employs Resource Modelling Associates (RMA) program to simulate hydraulic and water quality data. This research will determine the most representative water sampling location and type of TSS for calibration analysis. Next, this research simulates two scenarios of lake's conditions. The simulation is run by modelling the lake with wetland scenario and with rainy season scenario. After running several iterations, the most representative water sampling location is in the upper part of the water column and the best model of TSS is mixed TSS. Two simulated scenarios produce a reasonable result and could predict the future conditions of Agathis Lake. The research recommends that the sediment trap, that is located in the inlet of the lake, should be well-treated regularly in rainy season, and Universitas Indonesia should manage and arrange the suitable plants to be applied in the future constructed wetland.					; Marthanty, Dwinanti/Q-5698-2019; Prastica, Rian Mantasa Salve/AFW-6634-2022	Prastica, Rian Mantasa Salve/0000-0002-4873-2812; 													2261-236X						2019	270								04019	10.1051/matecconf/201927004019	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/matecconf/201927004019													WOS:000468572100046

However, little is known about the survival of loaches in this area and whether they are safe to eat after having been exposed to residual organochlorine pesticides (OCPs). Although some OCPs such as dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethanes (DDTs), hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), aldrin, and dieldrin have been banned in China, they can still be detected in the agricultural environment. In this study, water, sediment, and loaches (water and sediment collected 3 times; loaches only at harvest) in the HHRT were simultaneously sampled throughout the culture season and analyzed for 22 selected OCPs. Results showed that the concentration of total OCPs in the water and sediment uniformly decreased in the following order May > August > October and that samples collected during August and October clustered together in nMDS analysis, differing from those collected in May. Some OCPs, such as heptachlor, heptachlor epoxide, endosulfan I, endosulfan II, DDTs and HCHs were present in abundance. DDTs and HCHs were persistently present in low sediment concentrations at 0.21-1.27 and 0.01-0.95 mu g kg(-1), respectively, suggesting that a new origin of these pesticides may exist. Heptachlor accounted for the majority of OCPs at the beginning of the co-culture season and was calculated to influence the survival of loaches. Residual OCPs were generally not detected in the muscle of loaches (i.e. the edible part of loaches) being sent to market and therefore pose a low risk to humans who eat them. Overall, the results of this study will be useful in the production and consumption of loaches in rice-loach coculture systems, as well as for the promotion of sustainable development of the HHRT.					zheng, yao/M-2468-2019; song, chao/HTO-8527-2023	, yao zheng/0000-0001-5958-6008; 													1869-215X	1869-7534					2019	11						239	247		10.3354/aei00307	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/aei00307													WOS:000471078300006

SPATIOTEMPORAL CHARACTERISTICS AND THE INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION OF PHYTOPLANKTON IN TIEGANG RESERVOIR (CHINA)	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Chlorophyll a concentration [rho(Chla)] in phytoplankton is used to understand algal biomass and the primary productivity of a water body. To investigate the seasonal dynamics of [rho(Chla)] and their relationship with environmental factors Tiegang Reservoir at Guangdong China, continuous observation and analysis was carried out from April 2013 to June 2014. The distribution of algae had an obvious spatial heterogeneity, and the rho(Chla) gradual increased from the southeast to the northwest of the reservoir. From April to early December 2013 and from late April to June 2014, the dominant algae was cyanobacteria. In other months, bacillariophyta were dominant Chlorophyta were at a low level throughout the year. Multivariate analysis showed that water temperature (WT) was the primary driving factor of the spatio-temporal distribution of algae. The main environmental factors of cyanobacteria, bacillariophyta and chlorophyta were greatly different. Single environmental factors such as WT, total organic carbon (TOC), nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N), and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were significantly related to the competitiveness of cyanobacteria and bacillariophyta. And they can be used as early warning indexs for cyanobacteria and diatom blooms. The dual synergistic effects of WT and other environmental factors on the competitiveness of cyanobacteria and bacillariophyta were analyzed. A combination of environmental factors at high risk for cyanobacteria or diatoms were found.

Transforming the river into a lake, dams interrupt the continuity of river flow to downstream, affecting the water quality as well as biodiversity and behavior of the species in the river stretch below the dam. There can be an environmental filter through which only the species exhibiting strategies adapted to the new environment. In order to pass through environmental filter fish must be adapted to, or they must be able to change their behavior according to hydrological changes in the new environment. Otherwise, they have to migrate to an appropriate medium if they find on the river. A similar situation arises when two different dams (Suat Ugurlu and Hasan Ugurlu Dam Reservoirs) are built on the river in Yesilirmak river basin. The aim of this study was to determine hydrological effects on fish population and the water quality of the River Yesilirmak (Turkey). In the study, an assessment of water quality varieties between lotic and lentic habitats on Yesilirmak River (Turkey) is presented. Seasonal samples were taken from April 2008 to July 2009 at 9 sampling sites of riverine and dam lakes built on the river. According to the results of analysis of some water quality parameters; water depth, turbidity, current speed, chlorophyll-a and nutrients of water significantly varied between dam and river sections of Yesilirmak. Existence of dams have clearly formed spatial differences between river and lakes in terms of fish species. On the other hand, water quality data indicated that river and dam lake water had water quality classes ranging from 1 to 3. It seemed that intensive agricultural, industrial and anthropogenic activities could be responsible for creating this variability in water class level.

In the comparative study of climate change from the three poles (Antarctic, Arctic, and the Tibetan Plateau), the lake ice phenology which is mirrored the seasonal changes of lake ice, and it is an important index for assessing the synchronization and difference of climate change. Based on passive microwave, lake ice phenology of 48 lakes from 1978 to 2017 were extracted for northern Europe, Tibetan Plateau and Mongolia Plateau. A comparative analysis of the temporal variation for the lake ice phenology shows that from 1978 to 2017, the average ice cover duration showed a shortening trend of all regions, and the Northern Europe with the most dramatic shortening. The year of 2000 may be a turning of the lake ice cover duration in three regions. Especially in the northern Tibetan Plateau where is a trend of prolonged ice cover duration after 2000, and the delay of the break-up end date plays a more important role than the advance of the freeze-up start date. For the spatial changes, the variation of lake ice cover duration in the Tibetan Plateau shows a spatially aggregate phenomenon, and both the Northern Europe and Mongolian Plateau show changes with latitude. The comparison of lake ice phenology changes of three regions can provide more basis for climate characteristics analysis or climate change research. In the future work, various remote sensing data will be comprehensively used to obtain more information on lake ice phenology in High Mountain and cold regions. Meanwhile, it will combine other reanalysis data to find the reasons that affect the lake ice phenology, and provide support for the comparative study of the three-pole environment.

Recently, dam removals and fish passage improvements in the Penobscot River, Maine, have allowed river herring to return to reaches of the river that have been inaccessible since the late 19th century. Alosine populations have increased and this trend is anticipated to continue. This may increase forage in the system which could potentially increase growth for Smallmouth Bass, the dominant piscivore. We examined the diet and growth of Smallmouth Bass collected from areas of the Penobscot River watershed with and without access to river herring as prey. We collected 765 Smallmouth Bass throughout 2015, examined the stomach contents of 573 individuals, and found notable differences in diet among three river reaches with common seasonal trends. Juvenile river herring composed an average of 19% (SE = +/-6%) of stomach contents by mass from Smallmouth Bass collected in the freshwater tidal area but were rarely observed in the diets upstream. We used estimates from von Bertalanffy growth models to examine differences in growth among reaches and found that asymptotic length was the longest (425 mm TL) in the Tidal reach where access to river herring was unrestricted. We then used these data to predict changes to growth associated with increased access to juvenile river herring prey with bioenergetics models. Results indicated that substituting juvenile river herring for less energy-dense prey (e.g., invertebrates) may lead to increases in seasonal growth throughout the watershed as river herring populations continue to rebound in response to dam removal. Our results provide insight into the diet and growth of Smallmouth Bass in a large New England river, and provide a foundation for future work investigating unfolding changes to these characteristics following recent dam removals.																			0892-2284		978-1-934874-52-3				2019	87						75	92																WOS:000466820000005

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) leaching losses under simulating soil conditions in a real environment under different water managements. Determination index of nitrogen included Ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N), Nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N), Total nitrogen (TN) and for P was Total phosphorus (TP). Three water treatments, i.e. flooding irrigation (FI), shallow adjusting irrigation (SAI), and controlled irrigation (CI), were conducted in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Results showed that NH4+-N was the major form of N in percolation water, which accounted for 47.7-51.5% of the total nitrogen leaching losses under different water managements. Mean TN and NH4+-N concentrations were significantly higher in CI and SAI than in FI during the most of the rice growth stage, presenting a trend of SAI>CI>FI. The considerably high TN and NH4+-N concentrations via leaching can cause eutrophication of water bodies in the nearby region of paddy fields during the rice growing season. However, the NO3--N concentrations during the most rice growth stage showed a trend of CI>SAI>FI. The TP concentrations for all treatments kept below 0.2 mg L-1, indicating a small risk of P leaching losses. As a result, it is necessary to comprehensively consider the negative impact on environmental pollution while considering the water-saving benefits of water-saving irrigation. According to the experimental data of this study, CI is more suitable for application in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River of southern China than SAI.																			1018-4619	1610-2304					2019	28	8					5997	6006																WOS:000480511400034
J	SCHELL, DM				SCHELL, DM			C-13 AND C-14 ABUNDANCES IN ALASKAN AQUATIC ORGANISMS - DELAYED PRODUCTION FROM PEAT IN ARCTIC FOOD WEBS	SCIENCE												Inputs of terrestrial peat C to the nearshore Alaskan Beaufort Sea from erosion and fluvial transport are of the same magnitude as in situ primary production within 10 km of shore. C-13/C-12 ratios and C-14 abundance in marine organisms show that only small amounts of the terrestrial C are transferred beyond the microbial level. Freshwater organisms are heavily dependent on peat, as shown by pronounced seasonal radiocarbon depressions in resident fish and ducks. Tundra ponds and lakes are areas where accumulated terrestrial peat C is apparently transferred to aquatic insect larvae and passed on to higher organisms. The lack of functionally analogous abundant marine prey organisms may explain why peat C is not efficiently transferred to apical food web species in the marine environment.																			0036-8075	1095-9203					1983	219	4588					1068	1071		10.1126/science.219.4588.1068	http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.219.4588.1068								17811748					WOS:A1983QD12600027
J	Rosso, JJ; Quirós, R				Jose Rosso, Juan; Quiros, Rolando			PATTERNS OF REPRODUCTIVE MOVEMENTS IN THE SILVERSIDE Odontesthes bonariensis	INTERCIENCIA												During the breeding season some lacustrine fish species migrate between different habitats. In lakes of the Pampa Plain, the abundance of sexually mature individuals and sex ratio in populations of the silverside Odontesthes bonariensis vary seasonally in littoral habitats. Nevertheless, little is know about simultaneous events in lake other areas or how abiotic factors are related with this behavior This paper explores temporal and spatial patterns in the abundance of sexually mature individuals and sex ratio of this species in a shallow lake of the Pampa Plain. Relationships between observed patterns, presence of littoral vegetation and environmental variables are discussed. This approach aims to find evidence of reproductive movements as well as the direction and habitats involved in such displacements. Two littoral sites with contrasting vegetation structure and their immediate pelagic zones were surveyed during two consecutive reproductive seasons. There was a notable synchronization between the increase in the female:male ratio in pelagic zones, the gonad development of females, and the presence of ripe males in littoral habitats. This result suggests local movement of ripe males toward the littoral environments. Ripe males seemed to prefer littoral areas where vegetation was present. The seasonality of these movements together with gonad development in both females and males suggest that local displacements may be part of a reproductive trait. It was also found that these movements may be favored by environmental gradients. Local displacements toward littoral areas were associated with water salinity, dissolved O(2) and temperature gradients.					; Rosso, Juan/ABC-5504-2020	Rosso, Juan Jose/0000-0001-6730-9385; 													0378-1844					JUN	2010	36	6					407	413																WOS:000279210000003

The maximum concentrations of fenobucarb, diazinon, iprobenfos and simetryn in the water were 1.6, 1.1, 24, and 2.4 mu g l(-1), respectively. We detected simetryn with peak width at half height for one month, and diazinon with that for two months. The seasonal changes in simetryn concentration in N. nucifera were similar to those in the water. The simetryn residue concentration was highest in the lamina (300 mu g kg(-1)) among the various plant organs. The residue and bioconcentration factor 6.0 in June for simetryn were lower than the reported values for aquatic plants.

J	HABERYAN, KA				HABERYAN, KA			FOSSIL DIATOMS AND THE PALEOLIMNOLOGY OF LAKE RUKWA, TANZANIA	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. A 23.1 m sediment core from Lake Rukwa, southwest Tanzania, records 13,000 years of climatic change in five diatom assemblage zones. Zone E (13,000-12,700 BP) reflects the transition from the waning late glacial arid phase to pluvial conditions, as indicated by the co-occurrence of diatoms associated with fresh and relatively saline conditions. Zone D (12,700-4400 BP) represents a moist period with frequent stratification, indicated by the halophobic genera Melosira and Stephanodiscus, which also represent alternating silica-rich and silica-depleted waters. Beginning with Zone C (4400-3900 BP) the lake became much more saline with Thalassiosira predominating. This drying trend was reversed slightly in Zone B (3900-3300 BP). During the last three millennia (Zone A), lake salinity was further reduced, while transitory moist phases were occurring in more northerly lakes such as Victoria and Kivu. 2. Lake Rukwa was relatively stable over a time scale of centuries, but on an annual basis is quite variable in salinity depending on the local rainy season. 3. These results agree well with the generalized paleoclimatic chronology of East Africa and suggest that the Holocene climatic regime of East Africa extended at least to 8.degree.

In the light-saturated layer, the seasonal variation in the photosynthesis rate per chlorophyll a was regulated by water temperature. The depth-integrated photosynthetic production rate was 0.21-1.48 g C m(-2) day(-1) and the maximum value was observed in midsummer when the water temperature af the mixed surface layer was highest. The critical nutrient for photosynthesis may be dissolved reactive phosphorus, which was generally <1 mu g P l(-1) throughout the observation period. In the trophogenic layer, respiratory organic carbon consumption, estimated from measurement of respiratory electron transport system activity, was 0.35-1.07 (mean 0.66) g C m(-2) day(-1) and corresponded, on average, to 79% of the photosynthetic carbon production rate. This implies that the major part of photosynthetic fixed organic matter might be recycled in the trophogenic layer. The estimated settling organic carbon flux at 20 m depth, from calculation of these parameters and changes in the particulate organic carbon concentration, was 0.01 (-0.09 to 0.13) g C m(-2) day(-1). The mean settling organic carbon flux measured by sediment trap at 20 m was 0.19 (0.09-0.31) g C m(-2) day(-1), higher than the estimated value. It seemed that organic matter collected by sediment trap may contain allochthonous matter and resuspended epilimnetic sediment matter.

Tuning of nest initiation in the breeding colony at Marsh Lake, Minnesota, was not related to age or body condition of adults. However, nests were initiated significantly earlier on a more isolated island with higher nest success than another island located nearer to the lake shore. We estimated an adult annual survival probability of 0.813 +/- 0.079, similar to that reported for other American White Pelican populations. We estimated the mean age at which American White Pelicans return to nest at Marsh Lake and found that pelicans are unlikely to begin nesting until they are at least 5 years old.

However, interspecific associations between Rainbow Trout and native non-salmonid species have received little attention. Cottus spp. (sculpin) are a native benthic species group that comprise an important component of many lentic and lotic ecosystems in North America. In this study, we examined seasonal habitat associations between juvenile Rainbow Trout and C. cognatus (Slimy Sculpin) in a stream in the Lake Ontario watershed in New York. There was evidence of habitat partitioning among the age classes examined, with overyearling Rainbow Trout and subyearling Slimy Sculpin occupying disparate habitat. The habitat use by subyearling Rainbow Trout and overyearling Slimy Sculpin was similar, which may increase the potential for competition between these age groups. Overyearling Rainbow Trout exhibited the highest degree of habitat selection, whereas subyearling Slimy Sculpin exhibited the least. Our observations are the first reported on the ecological associations of Rainbow Trout and Slimy Sculpin and may provide important information in instances where sculpin are being re-introduced.																			1092-6194	1938-5307				DEC	2018	25	4					646	655		10.1656/045.025.0409	http://dx.doi.org/10.1656/045.025.0409													WOS:000454162200010

The types of period and their sequence determine the regime of water stages in lakes. The article applies the unsupervised approach to analysis of water level fluctuation patterns, where the regime is identified by grouping analytical parameters. Hydrological periods were designated by grouping elementary time units of the hydrological year (pentads) based on the similarity of their parameters, namely water level frequency distributions. The analysis covered daily water stages in 33 lakes in Poland from the period from 1984 to 2012. Five types of hydrological period were designated. The studied lakes differ in the number, type and sequence of hydrological periods in an average annual cycle. Most of the lakes (19 lakes) have a 4-period temporal structure of water stages with the course of water stages in a year characteristic of this geographical zone. No spatial patterns occurred in the location of lakes from particular groups. This suggests the dominant role of local factors in determining the seasonality of water stages.

J	MILLHAM, NP; HOWES, BL				MILLHAM, NP; HOWES, BL			NUTRIENT BALANCE OF A SHALLOW COASTAL EMBAYMENT .1. PATTERNS OF GROUNDWATER DISCHARGE	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The rate and pattern of groundwater discharge to a shallow coastal embayment was found to be very dynamic, being modified by short-term changes in upland hydrologic processes, fluctuations in the hydraulics of the receiving waters, and long-term changes due to depositional processes within the tidal basin. The regional and embayment morphology resulting from deglaciation and subsequent depositional processes within the aquatic system were found to be major factors affecting current patterns of groundwater discharge. Discharge through the embayment bottom based upon measured profiles of interstitial salinity, temperature, and porosity indicated that fine-grained, subtidal sediments (> 1 m thick) had low hydraulic conductivities and acted as aquicludes, limiting seepage to the marginal nearshore zone. The hydraulic gradients determining groundwater discharge to embayment waters were coupled to tidal elevations, generating periodic increases or decreases in rates of freshwater inflow. Water table maps and interstitial salinity profiles indicated that as mean tidal levels increased, groundwater discharge decreased, and conversely at low mean tide levels discharge into the embayment increased. During peak embayment levels the embayment acted like a flow-through lake with groundwater discharging along one shore while saline embayment waters simultaneously infiltrated along the opposite shore. Simultaneously, upland groundwater flow diverged from the embayment, resulting in significant reduction (29%) in the area contributing groundwater to the embayment. Changes in the patterns and rates of groundwater discharge, due to seasonal variations in water table elevation or short-term variations in embayment level, underscore the need to integrate upland water table mapping with hydraulic measurements within the zone of discharge when estimating the input of groundwater and groundwater-borne nutrients to coastal embayments.																			0171-8630					SEP	1994	112	1-2					155	167		10.3354/meps112155	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps112155													WOS:A1994PG73100015

However, some species showed significant differences when all habitat types were pooled. Species richness were positively correlated with maximum seasonal water temperature in lakes. Temperature in itself does not appear to be an important factor governing the distribution of macrophytes within the study area, although it may operate through other site variables such as water body size and type, and through indirect effects on water chemistry.																			0304-3770	1879-1522				AUG	1989	34	4					367	373		10.1016/0304-3770(89)90079-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(89)90079-X													WOS:A1989AL78500006

We also estimated the population density based on under-water observations. The percentage of the landlocked form was remarkably high in the upper stream and very low in the lower stream in June. The percentage of the landlocked form decreased remarkably in the upper stream in both rivers in August. The percentage of the landlocked form decreased to almost zero in December. These seasonal changes in the mixing rate of the landlocked form suggested a difference in the migration pattern of the landlocked form and the amphidromous form in the river.

This prospective study is based on Late Neogene material from Chad. It thus provides preliminary results that interest the reconstruction of paleoenvironments in ancient hominid bearing sites and that also document paleoenvironmental changes in continental Africa along a critical time period for global change. We prepared a set of various fish bones and turtle plates from Chadian Mio-Pliocene fossiliferous areas. We were able to analyse growth rates recorded during the course of the life of the animals in about half of the fossils initially sampled for the study. The main conclusions are: 1) the absence of a relationship between the external aspect of the fossils and the preservation of the growth marks, which means that visible features are not helpful in primary sampling; 2) at least in the Neogene Chadian sites, cathodoluminescence does not help to reveal growth marks; 3) growth rate patterns observed in the section of the body of the fin spines in claroteids, latids and polypterids and in pelomedusoid plates seem to be informative about environmental control of animal growth; and 4) depending on the taxa, different environmental informations can be obtained.					; Otero, Olga/T-5467-2018	de Rafelis, Marc/0000-0002-1466-249X; Otero, Olga/0000-0002-8129-2054													1464-343X	1879-1956				NOV	2018	147						126	135		10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2018.06.005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2018.06.005													WOS:000447096300009
J	STAUFFER, RE				STAUFFER, RE			ELECTRODE PH ERROR, SEASONAL EPILIMNETIC PCO2, AND THE RECENT ACIDIFICATION OF THE MAINE LAKES	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Based on laboratory experiments involving standard pH protocols, on statistical analysis of data from the Eastern Lake survey, and on independent field evidence (1985-86), recent (post 1975) electrometric pH measurements for Maine lakes are reevaluated for accuracy. A standard pH protocol used in Maine up until September 1985 can introduce bias of ca. =0.3 to -0.4 pH units for representative epilimnetic samples with low Co2 concentrations (near atmospheric equilibrium). The bias arises out of the very long electrode equilibration times for such samples. A new protocol using these same Ross combination electrodes provides pH estimates accurate within 0.03 pH units for a wide range of northeastern environmental samples, and independent of sample DOC and conductance. The new pH measurements, when paired with the earliest colorimetric measurements from the same Maine lakes, indicate that epilimnetic pH''s may have increased significantly (by 0.1 to 0.2 units) since the pioneering lake surveys of G.

They are known as 'Zones of Bio-rhythm', providing shelter to abundant aquatic life. The cyclic variation of nutrients in this region provides a clue to the continued and enriched presence of a variety of fish. This study reports on the different forms of phosphate in the resuspended sediments collected during the seasons with and without mud banks from the above mentioned coastal zones. Applying sequential and parallel chemical extractions using eight different schemes, the major forms of phosphate namely exchangeable P, anion exchangeable P, carbonate bound P, labile and resistant organic P, Fe-, Al- and Ca bound P and hydrolysable P have been determined. Quantitatively, these fractions vary and exhibit seasonal fluctuations. The concentration of potentially available anion exchange P, together with resistant organic and hydrolysable surplus P, provide an explanation to the existing organic food web supporting the aquatic life. Sediment phosphate fractionation reflects the role of chemical speciation of nutrients in the propagation of mud banks and is indicative of the biogenic processes controlling the pathways of phosphate in these coastal waters.																			0018-8158					FEB 12	1993	252	1					61	69		10.1007/BF00000128	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00000128													WOS:A1993KX97000006

The restoration measures involved diversion of the main inlet and removal of upper 1-m sediment and biomanipulation of the fish community. Between January 1997 and November 1999, we sampled sediments seasonally to analyse changes in benthos in relation to other abiotic and biotic characteristics of the system. The benthic community of the lake was composed of three families and nine genera. The maximum density (646 ind m(-2)), as well as the maximum taxonomic richness (six), were observed 1 month after the lake was refilled. Since 1998, the benthic abundance decreased considerably and continuously and a total absence of benthic organisms was registered by the end of the year. The low abundance of macroinvertebrates during 1997 could be explained by the food preferences of the dominant fish species, and the high fish biomass at the beginning of the biomanipulation process. However, the most relevant physico-chemical temporal patterns were the increase of organic matter and nutrients in the sediment and the fluctuations of oxygen and nitrate in the deepest layer of the water column. The disappearance of benthos was related to these temporal changes. These results stress the importance of the increase of organic matter for the changes in the physicochemical environment, and its importance in the benthic succession and possible collapse. We suggest that in hypertrophic lakes, the effects of organic matter enrichment in the sediment can be even more relevant than fish predation in shaping the zoobenthos.																			1386-2588	1573-5125				DEC	2005	39	4					455	464		10.1007/s10452-005-9004-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-005-9004-4													WOS:000233733400007

The vertical distribution changed ontogenetically throughout the year and was restricted to depths with a water temperature < 12 degrees C. Newborn amphipods remained in the pelagic zone throughout the day while larger amphipods exhibited marked diurnal vertical migrations: individuals stayed on the lake bottom during the day and ascended to the pelagic zone at night. Gut fullness and contents of the migrating amphipods indicated that they fed upon plankton in the pelagic zone at night. Our results indicate that these migration patterns probably reduce the amphipod's predation risk from fish. As a result, J. annandalei may play an important role in the vertical translocation of material and energy in the Lake Biwa ecosystem.

The estimated rates of removal obtained from the Sr-90-Y-90 disequilibrium showed good agreement with (a) measured rates of mass removal obtained from settling particle fluxes in sediment traps and the inventories of suspended material and (b) independently obtained removal coefficients for the scavenging behavior of two different isotopes of particle-reactive plutonium, present in the water column because of different processes. Because Sr-90 is widespread and readily measurable in freshwater systems as a result of fallout from nuclear weapons testing, the Sr-90-Y-90 disequilibrium is a potentially valuable resource for examining particle dynamics in surface waters.

J	SCHMIDARAYA, JM; ZUNIGA, LR				SCHMIDARAYA, JM; ZUNIGA, LR			ZOOPLANKTON COMMUNITY STRUCTURE IN 2 CHILEAN RESERVOIRS	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The zooplankton communities of two Chilean reservoirs were investigated during a year-cycle from September 1983 to November 1984, particularly with regard to the seasonal distribution of species as well as the effect of some environmental factors. Average temperature and oxygen values over the year were similar between the two reservoirs, while high average values of conductivity and chlorophyll-a, together with lower water transparency and extreme changes on the water levels were characteristic to Rungue. A great difference could be seen in the total number of species recorded in both reservoirs, 41 species in Penuelas (70.7% rotifers, 22.0% cladocerans and 4.9% copepods) compared to 21 species in Rungue (81.0% rotifers, 9.5% cladocerans and 9.5% copepods). Moreover, fluctuating patterns on the average abundance of some zooplanktonic groups, diversity values and species richness, and a massive development of rotifers within a short time were detected in the latter reservoir. This pattern suggest a "disturbance" of the zooplankton community, caused probably by the unstable conditions on the water environment created by the annual water renewal. On the contrary, in Penuelas average zooplankton abundances and community parameters (species richness and diversity), varied much less and followed the seasonal changes of the year cycle. The predominance of rotifers (few species with high abundances) and low zooplankton diversity values characteristic in Rungue, reflect that this reservoir is either at an early phase on the evolution of its zooplankton community, or reflects a disturbed community when compared to the other reservoir.																			0003-9136					JAN	1992	123	3					305	335																WOS:A1992HC13300003

Modeling the fluxes of nitrogen, phosphate and sediments in Linthipe catchment, Southern Lake Malawi Basin: Implications for catchment management	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH												This study was carried out to investigate the fluxes of nutrients and sediments in Linthipe River catchment of Lake Malawi basin and the manner in which it is affected by anthropogenic activities and natural processes. Data on climate, nutrients, land use, soil and hydrology were collected to model fluxes of nutrients and sediments using the generalized watershed loading function (GWLF) model. The correlation coefficient (r(2)) derived from comparing the observed and simulated river discharge was 0.92. For sediments, total nitrogen and total phosphorus, comparison of predicted values with observed data were not statistically significant. The data was also used to model hypothetical management scenarios. A hypothetical 10% deforestation of the catchment may lead to an increase in annual sediment, nitrogen and phosphorus loads by 27.1, 15.7 and 2.9%, respectively. The GWLF approach overall appears to provide reasonably good estimates of mean annual sediment and nutrient loads. Results from this study suggest that anthropogenic activities (agriculture and deforestation) may be by far the largest source of sediment and nutrient loading especially during the rainy season.																			1991-637X					MAR 18	2010	5	6					424	430																WOS:000276321900003

A model of cesium radionuclide cycling between sediment and waterbody is proposed, which is based on ammonium production and cesium release in the sediment due to microbial decomposition of organic matter. This hypothesis is corroborated by results of field measurements of temperature profiles and the depth distribution of the cesium radionuclide inventory in the sediment and of laboratory experiments with respect to the enhancement of cesium radionuclide release from sediment samples by increasing the metabolic activity of microorganisms in the sediment.																			0033-8230						1994	66-7						433	436																WOS:A1994QE24500064

Impacts of temperature, morpholine, and chronic radiation on the embryonic development of round whitefish (Prosopium cylindraceum)	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												During incubation, round whitefish embryos may experience fluctuating or elevated temperatures from natural (e.g., seasonal temperature changes) and/or anthropogenic sources. Anthropogenic sources like once-through cooling discharges from nuclear power plants can also expose embryos to chemicals (e.g., morpholine) and/or radiation. To examine the effects of these potential stressors on embryogenesis, round whitefish were incubated under fluctuating or constant temperatures, with morpholine or Cs-137 gamma rays. We report the percentage of prehatch and posthatch mortality, developmental rate, hatch dynamics, and morphometrics at 4 development stages. Embryos reared at constant temperatures had delayed developmental stage onset and median hatch, higher mortality at constant 8 degrees C, and lower mortality at 5 degrees C, compared with embryos reared under seasonal temperature regimes. Embryos incubated with 500mgL(-1) morpholine (>200x regulatory limits) had advanced hatch, reduced body size, and increased prehatch (100% at 1000mgL(-1)) and posthatch (approximate to 95% at 500mgL(-1)) mortality compared with controls. Relative to controls, embryos irradiated with 0.16 mGy/d had larger body mass early in development, and all irradiated embryos had decreased posthatch mortality; the lowest dose was >300x discharge limits. Our study suggests that fluctuating or elevated temperatures and high-dose morpholine can alter development rate, hatch dynamics, and growth, and/or increase mortality compared with embryos reared at constant temperatures of 5 degrees C; conversely, low-dose irradiation had transient developmental effects but may benefit early posthatch survival.

J	Specziár, A; Turcsányi, B				Specziar, Andras; Turcsanyi, Bela			Calendar and thermal time-based growth models for common carp and pikeperch, and the influence of stocking strategy in Lake Balaton, Hungary	KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS												Common carp Cyprinus carpio and pikeperch Sander lucioperca are widely distributed and economically important freshwater fishes. Because these species are extensively stocked both within and outside of their native ranges, it is important to assess the effect of these actions. We aimed to analyse growth rate and its variability related to stocking strategy (season x lake area x habitat x fish size) in common carp and pikeperch in Lake Balaton (Hungary), based on cooperative tagging experiments with anglers. In both species, length increment was more closely associated with thermal time (degree-day sum) over 8 degrees C threshold water temperature than calendar time. Except a marked decrease with increasing fish size, stocking parameters had little effect on length increment. Growth models based on the GROTAG method and the von Bertalanffy's asymptotic length (L-infinity) and growth rate (K) are provided. Compared to other habitats, estimated growth rate proved to be high in common carp (128 mm year(-1) at 300 mm standard length) and modest in pikeperch (61 mm year(-1) at 250 mm standard length). We concluded that stocking rate even might be increased in common carp, while management of the pikeperch population should rather be based on catch restriction measures than intensified stockings.

The study was aimed at investigating the influence of cultivation frequency on non-crop species composition. It was carried out in the peripheral settlements of Shorobe, Makalamabedi and Lake Ngami. Methods: Vegetation sampling was conducted from March to April 2016 in 36 fields of varying historical cultivation frequencies. The cultivation frequencies were 5, 10 and 15 years with an uncropped control site. Sampling was done in 1-m(2) quadrats placed 10 m apart along a line transect. Shannon's diversity and equitability indices were used to compare diversity for each cultivation frequency within and across the study sites. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to investigate significant differences in diversity between cultivation frequencies. Rank of abundance was used to determine the association of weeds with the cultivation frequencies. Results: Cultivation frequency did not influence species diversity (p > 0.05) at either Lake Ngami or Shorobe. Species evenness was significantly different (p < 0.05) between the cultivation frequencies at Shorobe, but not at either Makalamabedi or Lake Ngami. There was a significant difference (p < 0.05) in diversity indexes across the four cultivation frequencies. The 5-year frequency recorded the highest median score (Md = 1.352) while the 15-year frequency recorded the lowest median score (Md = 1.035). Corchorus tridens was the most abundant noncrop species at the 5- and 15-year frequencies. Cynodon dactylon was most abundant in the 10-year frequency while Cyperus esculentus was most abundant in uncropped fields. Conclusions: Cultivation frequency influenced weed species diversity and composition in flood recession farming. Flood recession farming fields were dominated by common weed species which are also troublesome in dryland arable farming. Uncropped sites were composed of wetland species that tolerate some dry periods or seasonal flood plains.					; Murray-Hudson, Mike/N-1140-2013; Kashe, Keotshephile/JHV-0619-2023; Murray-Hudson, Michael/N-1140-2013	Kashe, Keotshephile/0000-0002-5661-4197; Murray-Hudson, Michael/0000-0001-6873-0913														2192-1709				SEP 27	2018	7								33	10.1186/s13717-018-0144-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13717-018-0144-6													WOS:000514095700001

With one exception, tagged fish remained separated from each other during the spawning season. Distances moved by tagged fish were not related to fish size or location of initial capture along the river. Movements were generally shorter (mean, 23.2 km) than those reported for this species in the Green River basin, in part because of important habitat differences between the two rivers.

Analysis of water, suspended particles, and bottom sediments sampled at different localities at different times of year (from April to November) revealed that methyl mercury (CH3Hg+) levels are not controlled by the total abundance of inorganic Hg but are highly dependent on the abundance of organic matter and planktonic algae. CH3Hg+ levels were anomalously high in the presence of sewage effluents and associated algal blooms and at times of reduced river discharge, when the flushing and dilution of nutrients were minimal. At elevated organic carbon, nitrogen, and chlorophyll concentrations, CH3Hg+ levels were high even if inorganic Hg levels were low; but at low organic carbon, nitrogen, and chlorophyll concentrations, CH3Hg+ levels were low even if inorganic Hg levels were high. The results are ascribed principally to stimulation of the activities of Hg-methylating microorganisms by organic nutrients from algae and sewage. The possibility of amerliorating the Hg problem by reducing nutrient pollution is discussed.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				OCT	1986	43	10					1873	1887		10.1139/f86-232	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f86-232													WOS:A1986E099600006

MFO enzyme activity in fish	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												As part of the Slave River Environmental Quality Monitoring Program, a background data set of baseline concentrations was collected for various environmental components including fish, water, bottom sediment, and suspended sediment. Fish collections included a series of hepatic MFO analyses on walleye, northern pike, lake whitefish, and burbot. The EROD and AHH activity and P450 levels of fish, as well as weight, length, age, condition factor, and liver and gonadal somatic indices are described. Levels of EROD and AHH activity were of an order of magnitude expressed by the following relationship: walleye > northern pike > burbot > lake whitefish. Males consistently showed higher EROD, AHH activity and cytochrome P450 content relative to females of the same species even at control sites. Physical parameters varied very little within sites and exhibited some differences with the reference sites. A good MFO data set was collected for walleye and northern pike, but limited conclusions were possible with the lake whitefish and burbot data due to the overlap of sampling with the spawning season. Hepatic MFO enzyme activity indicated that some differences were evident in fish sampled from the Slave River relative to background/reference lakes; however, in many cases no differences were observed. Five years of biochemical effects studies have determined that the Slave River had low levels of induction suggesting a relatively pristine environment. This is further supported by the water, sediment, and body burden chemistry components of the Slave River Environmental Quality Monitoring Program.

Captive mallards laid larger eggs than wild birds. In captivity, game-farm ducks laid larger eggs than wild-strain birds, but when they were exposed to wild conditions the size was reduced. Captive ducks supplied with high-protein food laid larger eggs than ducks fed low-protein food. In the wild, there was a negative correlation between egg size and population density. Various wild Swedish populations showed similar egg-size variations among years, indicating some common factor operating outside the breeding season. In the food quality experiments, clutch size was positively correlated with egg size, but no correlation was found in wild populations. A negative correlation between clutch size and laying date, obtained in the wild, was not found in captivity. Egg and clutch sizes were both significantly smaller in a lake with food competition from fish than in an area rich in lakes empty of fish. When comparing egg characteristics of mallard populations it is important to distinguish between wild, captive wild-strain, and captive game-farm birds.																			0008-4301	1480-3283				JAN	1991	69	1					156	162		10.1139/z91-024	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z91-024													WOS:A1991EX56500024
J	STENSON, JAE				STENSON, JAE			VARIATION IN CAPSULE SIZE OF HOLOPEDIUM-GIBBERUM (ZADDACH) A RESPONSE TO INVERTEBRATE PREDATION	ECOLOGY												The gelatinous capsules of Holopedium gibberum is variable in size, and seasonal size development shows different courses in different lakes. Reasons for this variation were experimentally studied. Differences in density of invertebrate predators rather than abiotic differences were responsible. In experiments, adaptive changes in capsule size took place without any physical contact between Holopedium and the predator Chaoborus obscuripes, suggesting a chemically triggered mechanism. The specific receptor in Holopedium and the key substance released by the predator are not yet known. The experiments showed that the same Holopedium individual that received the stimulus reacted by a direct phenotypical change. The reduction of capsule size in response to reduced predator density suggests a cost in maintaining this antipredator armor. A large capsule leads to a higher cost for food gathering because of an increased drag in the water. The need for better armor may postpone the start of reproduction in Holopedium.																			0012-9658	1939-9170				AUG	1987	68	4					928	934		10.2307/1938364	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1938364													WOS:A1987J421300020

Berry			Barium and barite dynamics in Antarctic streams	GEOLOGY												Most natural waters are undersaturated with respect to barite (BaSO4), and while much work has focused on the processes of microbially mediated barite precipitation in undersaturated solutions, particularly in marine environments, little documentation exists on the changes in barite saturation in stream waters. We examined ephemeral glacial meltwater streams in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica, that undergo large variations in streamflow and temperature on both a diel and seasonal basis. We measured dissolved Ba in stream water in downstream transects and on a diel cycle, total Ba in stream sediments, algal mats, and lake sediments. Ba concentrations decreased downstream in all four transects, and mineral saturation modeling indicates these waters go from supersaturated to undersaturated with respect to barite in very short distances. Ba is concentrated in stream benthic algal mats at a factor less than observed in marine systems. Both seasonal and diel changes in stream water temperature affect the solubility of barite near glacial sources. Our work shows that both changing stream temperature and the presence of algal materials likely play significant roles in controlling Ba concentrations in polar streams.

EXPONENTIAL INCREASE OF THE DALMATIAN PELICAN (PELECANUS CRISPUS) POPULATION IN THE KURGAN AND TYUMEN REGIONS	ZOOLOGICHESKY ZHURNAL												In the 1930-1960's, the only breeding site of the Dalmatian pelican (Pelecanus crispus) in Western Siberia (within the borders of Russia) was Lake Chernoe located at the border between the Kurgan and Tyumen regions. In the 1970's, the species started breeding on two more lakes in the Tyumen Region: Bolshoe Beloe and Tundrovo. From the mid-2000's, another two lakes became sites for the species' breeding: the lakes Malye Donki and Manyass in the Kurgan Region. At the end of the 20th century, 100 and more pairs bred on each lake every year and smaller colonies lived on some other lakes. The total number of the species amounted at that time to 300-400 pairs. In 2004-2012, the number of Dalmatian pelicans reached already 600-800 pairs. These estimates are partially reconstructed, as there has never been a year when a bird census would be accomplished in all of the regional colonies at once. On 1-6 May 2017, we did a pelican census using drone aircraft on all lakes where large pelican colonies had been found. The highest number of occupied nests (430) was found on Lake Tundrovo; Lake Manyass - 243 pairs; Lake Chernoe 170 pairs; Lake Bolshoe Beloe was only inhabited by 7 Dalmatian pelican pairs. As regards Lake Malye Donki, no pelican colony was found there. Thus, the total quantity of occupied nests amounted to 850. Up to 50 more mature pairs might not have had the time to build nests and lay eggs by the first decade of May when we did the census. Nowadays, the region is a breeding territory for about 1/7 part of species' population in the world. Over the past 50-70 years, the region's population has been increasing exponentially; this being evidence of the conditions favourable for the species. The most probable of these conditions are: 1) the global climate warming continuing over the past decades and causing the aridization of more southern areas which drives the birds into the northern part of their distribution area; 2) the extension of the frost-free period of the year connected with the climate warming which allows the birds to start the breeding season earlier and finish it later; 3) the lack of human disturbance as the waterbodies concerned are located in nature conservation areas and are very rarely visited by people. Apparently, neither oscillations of the waterbody filling level nor fish abundance fluctuations render a significant impact upon pelicans due to their capability of far-distance feeding flights. This study was performed in the framework of a state contract with the Institute of Plant and Animal Ecology, Ural Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences, partly also supported by project no. 15-12-4-28 of the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences.					; Tarasov, Vladimir/G-1756-2016	Rabicev, Artur/0000-0002-8675-7172; Tarasov, Vladimir/0000-0002-8576-3167													0044-5134					SEP	2018	97	9					1143	1148		10.1134/S004451341809012X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S004451341809012X													WOS:000452092600007

The mite population peaked at the onset of the long dry season with 1,100 mites/leaf, declined sharply to a level of about 300 individuals/leaf, not to increase again until the next rainy season commenced. An indigenous phytoseiid predator Iphiseius degenerans was abundant during the dry spell with a maximum about 9 predators/leaf. A nonlinear regression analysis revealed that food depletion in combination with I. degenerans predation limited the population growth of the mites, whereas rain intensity had no effect. The predator exhibited no aggregative response to high densities of M. tanajoa and stayed mainly in the lower part of the canopy while the spider mites preferred the top, indicating that I. degenerans is a generalist predator without capacity to control M. tanajoa alone. However, in combination with another density dependent factor, such as food depletion, the predator may have prevented the spider mites from causing complete defoliation during the dry season.

The prevalence rates varied between these communities and with the year. Inter-town prevalence rates ranged from 5.96% to 54.00%. Intravillage prevalence rates ranged between 5.50% to 96.43%. Prevalance rates were highest in villages very close to Agulu lake. There was no significant difference in prevalence between the schools. Host age, but not sex, was found to play a significant role in prevalence and intensity of infection. There was also a strong correlation between visible haematuria and egg count per 10 ml urine, but eggs could be isolated in urine samples of different shades of coloration. Analysis of incidence of infection in these communities shows that Schistosoma haematobium incidence is high in Nri (55.17%) and low at Adazi Nnukwu (5.26%). Both Bulinus globosus and B. truncatus were found in the lake and both shed mammalian bifid schistosome cercariae.

Qualitative behavior of the UF and RO membranes with SUP was examined using the model SUP compounds: highly polymerized DNA, degraded DNA, inositol hexaphosphate and orthophosphate. To concentrate and molecular size fractionate SUP in lake water, UF and RO membranes were placed in series and the larger pore sized membrane preceding the smaller pore sized membrane. Six different membrane sequence configurations were examined. The percent SUP recovery of twenty lake water samples collected over a year ranged from 16 to 100%. The present SUP recovery was examined as a function of the membrane sequence used, volume concentration factor, the initial SUP concentration was the only major factor for SUP recovery. Calculated permeation factors for each sample illustrate that seasonal changes in the SUP composition may be occurring.																			0043-1354					JUN	1994	28	6					1355	1365		10.1016/0043-1354(94)90302-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(94)90302-6													WOS:A1994NK88000012

The seasonal cycles of the main species of the orders Calanoida and Cyclopoida were closely linked to variations in the water level.

J	Håkanson, L; Boulion, VV; Ostapenia, AP				Håkanson, L; Boulion, VV; Ostapenia, AP			The influence of biomanipulations (fish removal) on the structure of lake foodwebs, case studies using the Lake Web-model	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												This paper presents results on how intensive fishing (fish removal) is likely to influence the structure of lake foodwebs. The work is based on a comprehensive dynamic lake ecosystem model, LakeWeb, which accounts for production, biomasses, predation and abiotic/biotic interactions of nine key functional groups of organisms: phytoplankton, bacterioplankton, two types of zooplankton (herbivorous and predatory), two types of fish (prey and predatory), zoobenthos, macrophytes and benthic algae. The model uses ordinary differential equations, the ecosystem scale and gives seasonal variations (the calculation time is 1 week). It is designed to account for all fundamental abiotic/biotic interactions and feedbacks for lakes in general for the nine target groups. The LakeWeb-model has been calibrated and critically tested using empirical data and regressions based on data from many lakes. It has been shown that the model can closely capture typical functional and structural patterns in lakes, which should give credibility to the results presented in this work. Obtaining such results using traditional methods, i.e., extensive field studies in one or a few lakes, would be very demanding (in terms of money, persons involved and time). In this paper, results are presented for two lakes, one Swedish and one Belarussian. The intensive fishing operations carried out in Lake Blacksastjarn, Sweden, to reduce Hg-concentrations in fish did not succeed. A typical cost of an intensive fishing is about 10,000-30,000 USD per lake of this size ( less than or equal to 0.25 km(2)). The costs to remove fish would be about 40-120 USD per kg ww fish removed! Intensive fishing simulated for Lake Batorino, Belarus, to reduce the fish biomass will likely increase the prey fish biomass as long as the predation pressure on prey fish is lower than during the prefishing stage. The biomass of predatory fish will recover only slowly. However, this operation is not likely to succeed in lowering the algal volume in lakes with a high biomass of predatory zooplankton. This is easy to state qualitatively and the LakeWeb-model offers a practically useful tool to quantify such changes and identify lakes where biomanipulations are likely to fail or succeed.

Since Great Lakes participants tend to dive in both fresh and saltwater, dive three or four seasons a year, belong to dive clubs, and subscribe to dive magazines more often than other divers, it was hypothesized that these segments of divers would report lower degrees of constraints. In 1999, a total of 869 New York State divers returned mail surveys (37% response rate). Divers with Great Lakes experience did report significantly lower constraint levels for 7 of 11 factors than divers who had not used these lakes. All other hypothesized relationships were also supported; divers using both fresh and saltwater tended to experience constraints to a lower degree (differing significantly on 6 factors), as did year-round divers (10 factors), dive club members (6 factors), and magazine subscribers (7 factors), with one exception: magazine subscribers experienced higher degrees of constraint for conflict with other users. These results suggest that Great Lakes divers are able to negotiate perceived constraints more successfully than other types of divers, supporting the notion that they are a hardier and more robust "breed." In addition, dive clubs and magazines also seem to be associated with lower levels of constraint, suggesting their socializing, supportive, and educational influence on divers.																									2003	317						211	218																WOS:000224411500030

In this study, we examined the role of Fe nutrition in the growth and photosynthetic properties of two freshwater cryptomonads (Cryptomonas sp. UTCC 337 and C. erosa UTCC 446). Cryptomonas sp. appeared more tolerant to Fe deprivation compared with C. erosa. Growth rates calculated for Cryptomonas sp. provided 100 nm and 1000 nm Fe did not vary (0.55 d(-1)). Only cultures provided 10 nm Fe displayed significantly lower rates of growth (0.26 d-1) and lower cellular yields of chlorophyll. In contrast, cultures of C. erosa provided 10 rim Fe failed to grow, whereas cultures provided 100 nm Fe exhibited a reduced rate of growth (30% reduction) and lower yields of cellular chlorophyll (19% reduction) compared to high Fe (1000 nm) cultures. Photochemical competency, assessed by measuring DCMU-enhanced fluorescence, was high for cells of Cryptomonas sp. regardless of the level of Fe provided (F-v/F-m > 0.7). In contrast, photochemical competency was considerably reduced (F-v/F-m = 0.46) for C. erosa provided 100 nm Fe. Consistent with this, levels of the Fe-containing electron transfer catalyst ferredoxin were reduced by 2.5 times in C. erosa provided 100 nm Fe compared to Fe-replete cells. By comparison, ferredoxin levels varied only slightly in cells of Cryptomonas sp. provided either 100 nm or 1000 nm Fe.

Meromixis occurred during the cool, dry season, from June to August; its end was marked by upward displacement of some isotherms. From September to early November, the water temperature increased but the thermocline was still not distinct. From November onwards, stratification was enhanced and the thermocline became well defined and oscillated about 40 m. From February, while still oscillating, it gradually descended to a maximum depth of 70 m, in June. In July 1994, the cycle of meromixis started again. Oscillations of the thermocline indicated the existence of internal waves. The periodicity and duration of the oscillations implied that they were seiches similar to those already observed elsewhere on the lake, thus indicating their lake-wide existence. Other parameters, such as conductivity, pH, turbidity, ammonia and nitrate appeared to vary in response to these oscillations; thus the oscillations probably play a vital role in the biological production in Lake Tanganyika.																			0018-8158					JUL	1999	407						59	64		10.1023/A:1003716914421	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003716914421													WOS:000083710100006

Kutz were determined under laboratory conditions with algal samples collected from lower Green Bay, Lake Michigan. Photosynthesis rates were determined using oxygen difference in water circulated around the specimens. Photosynthesis reached light saturation at about 790 .mu.mol photons m-2 s-1 (PAR) and had a temperature optimum between 28 and 31.degree. C; maximum rates were 25-50 mg O2 g dwt-1 h-1. These parameters varied seasonally with water temperatures. There was no evidence for a decline in photosynthetic rate with increasing temperature over the ranges used in this study. It is concluded that, in this instance, such an effect is not responsible for the mid-season decline of this species. Other effects, such as those of respiration, photorespiration and phenology may, therefore, be important.																			0028-646X	1469-8137				MAY	1988	109	1					53	58		10.1111/j.1469-8137.1988.tb00218.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.1988.tb00218.x													WOS:A1988N649600007

A reserve shelterwood cut was applied to three additional stands to evaluate performance of white pine planted under 50% crown cover. After the first full growing season following harvest, 96% of the RTM harvested areas were stocked; sucker density averaged 27,000 (27 k) per acre versus 38.2 k per acre on a clearcut control, 47 % greater. Basal diameter of dominant suckers averaged 0.45 inch, 28% greater than the control, and mean height was 60 inches, 33% greater. The control site had 3.1 k stems per acre of associated commercial species versus 5.8 k on the RTM sites, an 87% difference. Four of the nine stands have been planted; first-year survival ranged from 75% to near 100%. The RTM shows promise for reducing sucker density, increasing their early growth, maintaining species diversity, and providing abundant regeneration of commercial species on a high proportion of the areas harvested. Early results indicate that both the RTM and shelterwood methods can facilitate restoring a component of native conifer species in these ecosystems.																									2001		18					137	143																WOS:000171432000013

A detailed study of Myriophyllum spicatum L. in a northern USA, temperate zone, seepage lake refutes the latter assumption, revealing that considerable spatial and temporal variability in biomass density exists. A two-to three-fold increase in biomass density during the growing season was significantly correlated with increases in plant height and biomass, specifically with increases in the relative weight of foliated segments of the plant. Biomass density remains a useful measure of plant community structure if spatial and temporal changes are accounted for.																			0018-8158					MAR 28	1997	347						69	74		10.1023/A:1003059000277	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003059000277													WOS:A1997XV45000007

Quantitative net samples (64-mu-m mesh) were taken at three stations on approximately 10 day intervals throughout 1986, and the dry weights and development times for each life stage were obtained from laboratory measurements and cultures. Total biomass of most of the dominant crustaceans, determined from 390 samples during 1986, was 44.85 mg m-3 (dry weight, DW) with adult females of Mesocyclops making > 43.5%. Alona diaphana, another common crustacean, is dealt with in a separate paper, as are the Rotifera. Production of the dominant crustaceans during 1986 was estimated by the growth increment summation (Winberg) and instantaneous growth (Ricker) methods. The annual integrated production of the two dominant cyclopoids is 535.2 mg (DW) m-3 (Winberg) while annual crustacean production totals 2.5 g (DW) m-3 (Ricker). The mean annual P/B ratio for individual species and stages varied from 221.0 for Diaphanosoma, to 121.7-143.0 for nauplii and 9.8-18.7 for copepodites of the cyclopoids. It was 55.8 for the dominant zooplankton species. Low or high zooplankton production and biomass turnover rates (P/B) cannot be used to characterize all tropical lakes consistently. However, production per unit biomass is likely to be higher in tropical lakes.																			0142-7873					JUL	1991	13	4					831	851		10.1093/plankt/13.4.831	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/13.4.831													WOS:A1991FV24100011

Earthworm densities and biomasses ranged from 5 to 114 m-2, and 0.5 to 11 g dry wt m-2 respectively. There were a total of six lumbricid species at the four sites, but the anecic species, Lumbricus terrestris (L.) was the dominant contributor to faunal biomass at three of the sites. Earthworms at the fourth site were two small endogeous species that had the lowest abundance and biomass for earthworms of the four sites. The influence of faunal activity on soil properties was measured by the Cs-137 (originating as fallout from atmospheric nuclear tests) distribution within 1 cm thick layers to a depth of 15 cm. Organic matter and Cs-137 distribution with depth were functions of both earthworm abundance and species. Sites with anecic earthworms had Cs-137 distributed throughout the surface horizons, whereas the site with endogeous species had higher Cs-137 levels remaining at or near the soil surface.																			0038-0717					DEC	1992	24	12					1451	1457		10.1016/0038-0717(92)90132-H	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0038-0717(92)90132-H													WOS:A1992KG74800042

Four zones were established in the lake based on 21 diatoms species and habitat affinities. The first three zones (prime three meters deep to six meters deep) were marked by the occurrence of Pinnularia gigas, Frustulia rhomboides, Encyonopsis krasskei, Eunotia camelus, E. femoriformis and E. monodon. Zone IV (seven to nine meters deep) was inhabited mainly by Surirella biseriata and Fragilariforma floridana. During the beginning of the rainy season, the diatom assemblage in Caco Lake was composed mainly by benthic and epiphytic forms that reflected the low lake levels and the abundance of littoral vegetation present in this lake.

BREEDING ECOLOGY OF NIGHT HERON (Nycticorax nycticorax Linne, 1758) IN THE LAKE VAN BASIN, TURKEY	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL AND PLANT SCIENCES												A study on breeding ecology of night heron (Nycticorax nycticorax) was conducted in the Lake Van Basin between 16 February 2006 and 04 October 2007 on four big islands inside the lake and sorrounding wetlands. The night heron only breeds on islands inside the lake in this region because it finds food in wetlands. Trees which numbers had been given previously were observed and, starting from pre-breeding period into March and June, data on nests and breeding were taken. The breeding period was about seven months (March - September). During this period, it was frequently observed that nests from the previous year were repaired and re-used. Both the male and the female repair the nest. Average dimensions of eggs laid on nests were measured as 49.33 +/- 3.2 mm in length, 32.19 +/- 1.35 in width, and with a weight of 29.66 +/- 5.01 grams. The number of eggs laid ranged from 1 to 6 per nest. In 1364 active nests observed within the entire breeding region, 4206 (92 %) of 4576 eggs hatched and 3923 (93 %) of all chicks managed to leave the nest. Brooding periods in 50 nests were observed separately in each breeding season. In 2006, average brooding period during the first period was 25.62 +/- 2.03 and it was 26.22 +/- 1.18 during the second period; in 2007, average brooding period during the first period was 26.10 +/- 1.69 and it was 25.60 +/- 1.76 during the second period. Juvenile growth periods for N. nycticorax have been observed as follows: in 2006, average 39.98 +/- 2.47 days during the first breeding period and 32.68 +/- 1.25 days during the second breeding period; in 2007, average 42.18 +/- 2.60 days during the first breeding period and 34.64 +/- 1.15 days during the second breeding period. A significant statistical difference has been observed between years and even periods in question (P < 0.01).																			1018-7081						2010	20	2					73	78																WOS:000279780200003

Application of whey to prevent re-oxidation in a passive anoxic in-lake reactor -success and failure	MINE WATER & INNOVATIVE THINKING					International-Mine-Water-Association Symposium on Mine Water and Innovative Thinking	SEP 05-09, 2010	Sydney, CANADA	Int Mine Water Assoc, Cape Breton Univ, Ind Res Chair Mine Water Remediat & Management, Enterprise Cape Breton Corp, Soc Expans Cap Breton, VEOLIA WATER, Solutions & Technol, amec, Stantec, cogent environm, Golder Associates, CONESTOGA ROVERS & ASSOCIATES, DHI WASY, Cape Breton Cty Econ Dev Author, asa analyt, Lhoist, ADI Ltd, ISLAND WELL DRILLERS Ltd, Cape Breton Partnership, CBCL Ltd, CAMPBELL SCI Canada Corp, SCUBA TECH, AIR CANADA				Anoxic microbial iron and sulfur reduction processes are promising tools to enhance neutralization of acidic environments. In an acidic pit lake from the lignite mine district of Lusatia, Germany (PL-in) an experimental set up (enclosure) had been installed to neutralize the sediment and the water column by adding organic substrates and lime to the sediment. Although microbial iron and sulfate re: duction processes were favoured and reduced iron sulfide phases were precipitated, a substantial and progressive neutralization of the sediment and water were not achieved within 6 years after the first substrate addition. The main reason for it was assumed to be re-oxidation of the reduced mineral phases, probably by oxygen supply during seasonal overturn of the water column. In October 2007, a cover plane was mounted on top of the enclosure to protect it against oxygen input. Regular supply of whey powder to the water was done over one year to provide stable anoxic conditions within the enclosure. To control the success of this measure, bi-monthly sampling of the water column was conducted including physico-chemical parameters. Two intense sampling campaigns of the sediment and porewater were performed just before starting and one year after the first addition of whey powder. Repeated whey additions kept the bottom water anoxic, but did not stimulate Fe(III) reduction in the water column. Iron sulfide phases in the sediment had not increased one year after enclosure coverage and whey addition, although microbial sulfate reduction proceeded in the sediment. This implies that re-oxidation of sulfides could not be prevented by the tested measures.

Japanese agriculture has created high nitrogen surpluses in agricultural lands due to the increasing rate of chemical fertilizer application and the increase of livestock. In this study, to estimate the nitrogen load exported to Koise River, a major river in Lake Kasumigaura, from its catchment area, extensive field survey and water quality experiments have been conducted from 2007 to 2008. Remote sensing data of QuickBird imagery was applied to the dataset on water quality during two years (Year 2007 for model calibration and Year 2008 for model validation) at 11 streams. Water quality indicator of total nitrogen (TN) were examined and an efficient approach, which estimates monthly pollutant loads directly from satellite imagery and ground observed hydrological data, was investigated. Then the pollutant loads of TN were estimated and prediction results show that the proposed simulation technique can be used to predict the monthly TN pollutant loads of river basins in Japan. Seasonal variation of pollutant loads from 2007 to 2008 were also analysed from different sources according to land covers. This study presents usefulness of remote sensing technique for evaluation and interpretation of water quality datasets and apportionment of pollution sources with a view to get better information about the water quality for more effective management of water resources in river basins.					he, bin/AAV-6319-2021; Yamashiki, Yosuke/D-3707-2009; Takara, Kaoru/AAR-5083-2020; Oki, Taikan/E-5778-2010														2194-9034						2010	38		8				528	533																WOS:000341930000115

Among the metals, Fe was the pollutant with the highest concentration (114.2 mu g L-1) and Pb contributed the most (34.5%) to the hazard index (HI) of the 22 WTPs, followed by Cr (30.3%) and Cd (18.4%), suggesting that the three metals may be of serious health concerns for local residents. The level of each metal could meet the related criteria of China and USA, except for Pb. Both hazard quotients of individual metals and HI of total non-carcinogenic risk in each WTP were below 1.0, suggesting that these pollutants posed little hazard to local residents. Temporal and spatial comparisons showed that high His more frequently occurred in low water seasons, and Jiangpu WTP had the highest HI, followed by Jiangning and Taichang. This study may provide some baseline information for the authorities to regulate and control the discharge of the metals into the Yangtze River, and serve as a basis for comparison to other rivers in the world.																			1018-4619	1610-2304					2010	19	8A					1648	1654																WOS:000282617500017

The purpose of usage of time series properties is to understand the driving forces and structures that produce the observed data and to fit the data into a model and proceeds them to forecasting, monitoring or even feed back and feed forward control. The essential difference between modelling data via time series methods and using the process monitoring methods is that in time series analysis the data points taken over time may have internal structure such as autocorrelation, trend or seasonal variation. This paper uses some of the time series techniques for modelling and analysis of the daily heavy metal monitoring data measured in some important lakes of Bucharest during March - November 2007 - 2009. The daily registration of lead, mercury and cadmium concentrations in surfaces water form a univariate time series that consists in single scalar observations has been recorded sequentially over equal time increments. These time series display periodicity that represents sinusoidal fluctuations over entire week and seasonality over the year. The seasonal pattern was consistent with a wave sine model. The autocorrelation function was used to identify the autocorrelation structure of series.					; Meghea, Irina/IYJ-8875-2023	Meghea, Irina/0000-0001-8471-1122; 													1314-2704						2010							677	683																WOS:000288622300094

The response of the ambient bacterial community to decomposing jellyfish biomass was evaluated in two marine ecosystems, the Gulf of Trieste (northern Adriatic Sea) and Big Lake (Mljet Island, southern Adriatic Sea). The major difference between these two ecosystems is that Aurelia sp. medusae occur throughout the year in the oligotrophic Big Lake, whereas in the mesotrophic Gulf of Trieste, they occur only seasonally and often as blooms. Addition of homogenized jellyfish to enclosed bottles containing ambient water from each of these systems triggered considerable changes in the bacterial community dynamics and in the nutrient regime. The high concentrations of protein, dissolved organic phosphorous (DOP), and PO43- immediately after homogenate addition stimulated increase in bacterial abundance and production rate, coupled with NH4+ accumulation in both ecosystems. Our preliminary results of the bacterial community structure, as determined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, indicated differences in the bacterial community response between the two ecosystems. Despite divergence in the bacterial community responses to jellyfish homogenate, increased bacterial biomass and growth rates in both distinctive marine systems indicate potentially significant effects of decaying jellyfish blooms on microbial plankton.

The chlorophyll-a concentration (Chla) in the lake changes from 5 to 374 mu g/L and the average is 49 mu g/L. The spectrum above water surface was measured by ASD FieldPro. The result shows, ( 1) TBCM in other lakes cannot be used directly in Taihu Lake; ( 2) TBCM of Taihu Lake built by using single month data produce lower error, and its RMSE ranges between 8.0 mu g/L and 17.6 mu g/L; The model based on all data collected in four months produce higher error, and RMSE is 26.8 mu g/L; ( 3) When data collected in August and September was used to validate the model built by using data in June and July, RMSE increased from 17.2 mu g/L to 50.7 mu g/L; ( 4) Samples with higher or lower Chla generate results with higher error. When samples in alga bloom (Chla>120 mu g/L usually) and samples with lower Chla (<30 mu g/L) were not used, RMSE of the model built by using June and July data decrease to 6.3 mu g/L, and RMSE of Chla estimation in August and September will be 28.9 mu g/L. This paper concludes that TBCM can be used to build Chla inverse model with higher accuracy of estimation in Taihu Lake, but model parameters must be refined in accidence with water body condition and time of the season before it can be applied to practical water quality monitoring work.

The basins, L226N and L226S were part of an ongoing eutrophication experiment in which C, N, and P were being added to L226N and C and N to L226S. The radiotracers moved to the sediments by sorption to settling particles and by being directly absorbed. The loss rates ranged from 3-8% .cntdot. d-1. Areal distribution in the sediments was largely governed by the percent sorbed to particles. Both basins exhibited seasonal anoxic hypolimnia in which redissolution of 59Fe, 6oCo, and 203Hg was great, of 75Se, 85Sr, and 65Zn only minimal, and 134Cs negligible. The overall behavior of each of the isotopes was nearly identical in the two basins, partly due to interbasin mixing. A least squares fit of the affinity for particles and loss rates to a whole-lake model yielded a settling velocity of 0.18 m .cntdot. d-1 and a benthic boundary layer of 370 .mu.m thickness.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1987	44			1			74	82																WOS:A1987L149200007
J	ADITE, A; VANTHIELEN, R				ADITE, A; VANTHIELEN, R			ECOLOGY AND FISH CATCHES IN NATURAL LAKES OF BENIN, WEST-AFRICA	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												A preliminary study of the ecology and commercial fish catches was carried out in the Toho-Todougba, Ahouangan and Dati lakes (1500 ha) in southern Benin (West Africa) over a period of 18 consecutive months. Water quality, species richness, and the reproductive biology of the dominant species, Sarotherodon galilaeus, were examined. Unlike Lagoon Toho-Todougba, lakes Ahouangan and Dati are less favourable for fish production because of their high total iron content and their relative low pH. The study revealed the existence of 19 species belonging to eleven (11) families: 16 species in Lagoon Toho-Todougba, 12 in Lake Ahouangan, and 7 in Lake Dati. Lakes Ahouangan and Dati had a relatively high faunal similarity whereas Lagoon Toho-Todougba exhibited a relatively low faunal similarity with the former systems. In Lagoon Toho-Todougba, six cichlid species were the most important component of the fishery: Sarotherodon galilaeus, Tilapia guineensis, T. zillii, T. mariae, Chromidotilapia guntheri, Hemichromis fasciatus. Three catfish species Chrysichthys auratus, Clarias agboyiensis, and Clarias lazera were harvested in low abundances. Some other fish, such as Polypterus senegalus senegalus, Protopterus annectens and Heterotis niloticus were captured sporadically, with H. niloticus appearing more consistently in catches than the others. Although not abundant, Gymnarchus niloticus and the African pike, Hepsetus odoe, were almost always present in the catches. Ctenopoma kingsleyae appeared only in Ahouangan. Some predatory species, such as Notopterus afer and Xenomystus nigri, are encountered only in lakes Ahouangan and Dati. In Lagoon Toho-Todougba, Sarotherodon galilaeus had a sex ratio (male:female) of 0.49:1, and size at maturation was estimated as 12.3 cm TL. The spawning period extended from May to September with the peak occurring in July. Fecundity was correlated to log-body length (r = 0.74) and log-body weight (r = 0.76). Fish catches were estimated at 389 kg ha(-1) year(-1); about 73% of which was Sarotherodon galilaeus. The overexploitation of juvenile fish and the use of this lagoon for the irrigation of palm tree plantations have reduced fish recruitment and mean size.																			0378-1909					AUG	1995	43	4					381	391		10.1007/BF00001173	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00001173													WOS:A1995RL62100009

The clones were isolated from two different temperate freshwater lakes. Both clones showed the same general trend with changing temperature. Most of the colonies were normal in size at low temperatures, but colony size was twice as large at high temperatures. Variable colony sizes were present at low percentages. Colony separation occurred at the oldest connection within the colony after cell division. Culture experiments showed that the rates of specific growth and colony separation were balanced except for a rather short period of time when the temperature was changed. Optical and scanning electron micrography did not show arty distinctive morphological structure at the point of connection except for porelli and mucilage pads. Seasonal changes in colony size of A. formosa observed in a freshwater lake are discussed based on these temperature results.																			0022-3646					DEC	1994	30	6					955	964		10.1111/j.0022-3646.1994.00955.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0022-3646.1994.00955.x													WOS:A1994QD95400007

During ten years (1979-1989) Lago Batata received a suspended solids discharge of 25,000 m3/day from a bauxite mine. The contents of POC, PN, carbohydrates and energy were measured and the sedimentation rates of particulate matter were estimated from two stations, one located in the disturbed area and another one located in the non-disturbed area. The results did not show any correlation between the water level fluctuations and the seasonal variations in nutritive value of the particulate matter, although sedimentation rates of sestonic matter were sensitively influenced by the levels of water. The most evident effect was the reduction of the nutritive value of the sedimenting particulate matter in the area affected by the tailings disposal.

When animal food was scarce, both fish species increased their consumption of macrophytes; roach sevenfold, and ide threefold. Along a typical littoral vegetation gradient, ide fed among helophytes, while roach fed in the zone outside. This different habitat selection was reflected in the most important plants consumed (ide: Equisetum fluviatile, roach: Characeae), and confirmed by gill net catches. During the vegetative season, roach avoided areas with dense vegetation. In shallow areas beyond the littoral, the most important food plant for both fish species was Potamogeton perfoliatus, which constituted 80% of the total food consumed (dry weight basis) in the roach and 35% in the ide. The diet shift to plants seemed to be strongly influenced by the supply of animal food and the intensity of intra- and interspecific competition.																			0029-8549	1432-1939					1985	66	4					461	467		10.1007/BF00379334	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00379334								28310783					WOS:A1985ALM5300001

The lakes were similar in biotic and abiotic factors and the artic charr populations were therefore treated as one population. Two size groups of fish older than 3 yr, called small charr and large charr, were found. The 2 groups differed in feeding habits, growth rates, age of maturity and spawning frequencies. They did not differ in the frequencies of the F- and S-serum esterase alleles, and were in accord with the model proposed by Johnson (1976) which states that the small charr and large charr are 2 different forms of the same population. Small charr recruit to the large charr by entering a period of fast growth. In the investigated lakes this occurred when the samll charr were 3-10 yr old. Some indications of rematuration of the small charr when entering the group of large charr were found.																				1095-8649					1985	26	3					313	330		10.1111/j.1095-8649.1985.tb04270.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8649.1985.tb04270.x													WOS:A1985AGM4500008

Annuli on the scales were clear and could be used as valid indicators of age. The population of the fish comprised only one age group. The growth rate of males was markedly greater than that of females. The fish were multiple spawners, reaching maturity in the second year. Minimum size for males at maturity was 32.9 mm in total length and 0.30 g in weight; for females, the minima were 41.0 mm and 0.73 g. During the breeding season, both sexes exhibited secondary sex characteristics, and the ratio of males to females was 1: 1.04 (n = 104). The size of mature eggs averaged 3.12 mm in length by 1.03 mm. in width. Fecundity per female for one age group ranged from 38 to 189 eggs, with an average of 93 eggs (n = 80).																			0270-5060	2156-6941				DEC	2002	17	4					501	505		10.1080/02705060.2002.9663928	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2002.9663928													WOS:000180470900002

The acetylene reduction technique used to estimate nitrogen fixation indicated that periphyton in 0-2 m water depth were capable of fixing up to 0.86 mg N .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. h-1 during the period of active nitrogen fixation from July to September 1981. Far Lake was fertilized with Phosphorus for 3 yr and had a higher rate of fixation than did a P- and N-fertilized lake or a control lake, in agreement with similar studies on temperate and subarctic lakes. A numerical model based on incoming light was used to predict the amount of nitrogen fixed in each study lake throughout the season. The calculated contribution of periphyton to the overall N budget for 1981 was 5% for the P- and N-fertilized lake, 16% for the control lake and 28% for the P-only fertilized lake.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				AUG	1990	47	8					1545	1550		10.1139/f90-174	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f90-174													WOS:A1990DU28900009

TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA												DUTKIEWICZ, A. VON DER BORCH, C. C. AND PRESCOTT, J. R., (2002). Geomorphology of the Lake Malata-Lake Greenly complex, South Australia, and its implications for late Quaternary palaeoclimate. Trans. R. Soc. S. Aust. 126(2), 103-115, 29 November, 2002. Lunettes, foredunes and beach ridges from the Lake Malata-Lake Greenly playa complex on the Eyre Peninsula attest to major changes in lake level and palaeoclimate over the last 320,000 years. These have been dated by a combination of thermoluminescence and radiocarbon techniques, thus allowing correlation with Late Quaternary Oxygen Isotope stages. The lakes experienced a major wet phase ca. 320 ka followed by multiple and episodes linked to relatively cool periods and low eustatic sea-levels between 115-16 ka. Aeolian activity and aridity were particularly intense during the Last Glacial Maximum with the onset of a dry climate and carbonate pellet lunette-building commencing as early as 26 ka. The Holocene palaeoclimate is marked by seasonally oscillating wet and dry periods reflected in the intermittent deposition of gypsum lunettes, carbonate ridges and quartz foredunes around the eastern margins of lakes Malata and Greenly.																			0085-5812					NOV 29	2002	126		2				103	115																WOS:000179645000004
J	Wann, JK; Chen, CTA; Wang, BJ				Wann, J. K.; Chen, C. T. A.; Wang, B. J.			A Seasonally Anoxic Mountain Lake with an Active Fe Cycle in Tropical Taiwan	AQUATIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Variations of temperature and oxygen indicate that the 2150 m high Great Ghost Lake in tropical Taiwan is seasonally stratified and anoxic. Low concentrations of ions and nutrients and the similarity in the distribution of the reduced species in the water column in the early stages of stagnation indicate that the production of the reduced species occurs mainly in the sediments with a subsequent release into the overlying water. In addition, the high organic matter content in the sediments and the short period of water overturn make Fe(II) the most abundant reduced species in the sediments and in the water column. As a result, the annual Fe cycle plays one of the most important roles in regulating the water chemistry and in driving the reduced species from the sediments to the anoxic hypolimnion. The distribution of reduced species during the stagnation is in agreement with the thermodynamic sequence. The accumulation rates of Fe2+, Mn2+, NH4+, sulfide and CH4 in the water column during the early stages of stagnation are about 5.07, 0.059, 1.69, 0.015 and 1.65 mmol m(-2) day(-1), respectively.

The overall prevalence of schistosomiasis mansoni in residents of Kebeles 8, 9 and 10 was 12%. The prevalence in Sertse Dengel school children was 45% and that in Dil Chibo school children was 32%. The peak prevalence in both sexes in school and non-school populations occurred in the age group 10-14 years. Intensity of infection showed a similar pattern of age variation as prevalence. Biomphalaria pfeifferi snail density peaked towards the end of the rainy season (September) in Lake Tana and around the middle of the dry season (January) on the shore of the River Abay. In September, infected snails were recovered from all collection sites. Of mice immersed in four water contact sites in September, schistosome infections developed in those immersed in three sites. Parasitological findings suggested that schistosomiasis infection rates depended on age and sex of individuals and geographical location of the place from the potentially infective water bodies. Snail population density and associated schistosomal infection in a human population depended on rainfall and associated ecological changes such as fluctuation in water level and vegetation density. As malacological findings and sentinel mouse immersion results indicated, it appeared that the main transmission season in Lake Tana region is towards the end of the rainy season although low level intermittent transmission may take place throughout the year.																			0014-1755					OCT	1991	29	4					199	211											1954954					WOS:A1991GM68900007

B.S.P.) provenance study were established between 1973 and 1977 through the cooperation of several organizations in the United States and Canada from the Atlantic Coast to Alberta. This study evaluates performance at 11 or 15 years from seed in 29 locations divided into 8 regional clusters of 2 to 10 experiments each. Analytical methods include correlations of height and survival with geographic and climatic variable, analyses of variance, and polynomial regressions followed by contour plotting. Best height was obtained in the Great Lakes States and in other temperate regions, and best survival in Newfoundland and some temperate regions with long growing seasons. Correlations between height and survival were positive and significant only in 10 locations, 8 of which were located in temperature regions. In many locations in boreal regions, correlations with latitude or climatic variables at the place of seed origin and height have opposite signs of correlations with survival, indicating difficulties when simultaneously selecting for good height and high survival in cold climates. Contour plots from the regressions demonstrate a similar trend by showing good pattern overlap of height and survival primarily in mild coastal (Newfoundland) or temperate continental climates (southern Quebec and Ontario, Great Lakes States). There is evidence that provenance differences are still developing and changes in rank are taking place, and therefore additional assessments are required in the future.																			0045-5067	1208-6037				FEB	1990	20	2					130	143		10.1139/x90-019	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x90-019													WOS:A1990CX60400002

ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Resource partitioning between Atlantic salmon parr, brown trout and Arctic charr was studied throughout the ice-free season in a north Norwegian lake. Juvenile salmon and trout (less than or equal to 160 mm) utilized the littoral zone and juvenile charr the profundal, while adult trout and charr (>160 mm) were found in both. Juvenile salmon and trout had a similar diet, although trichopteran larvae were more important for the trout and chironomid pupae and three-spined sticklebacks for the salmon parr. Small salmon and trout parr (less than or equal to 120 mm) had a higher diet overlap than larger parr (121-160 mm). The feeding habits of adult trout were similar to that of juvenile trout, but the former took larger prey items. At the population level, both salmon and trout were generalistic feeders with a broad diet, but at the individual level, both species had specialized on a single or a few prey categories. Juvenile charr were segregated from salmon and trout in both habitat and food utilization; they had a narrow diet consisting of chironomids and zooplankton, possibly reflecting their confinement to the profundal habitat which have a low diversity of potential prey. Larger charr also took zoobenthos and sticklebacks in the littoral zone.

Of these, 37 were considered to be true peatland fauna. The majority (23) of the peatland species are new North American or Canadian records and, of these, 10 are previously undescribed. Numbers m-2 yr-1 emerging from the fens were similar to neighbouring lakes but biomass (mg) m-2 yr-1 emerging was much less, indicating the small average size of the fen chironomids. Emergence began in early May and was virtually completed by late July-early August in all three years of the study. Most of the emergence occurred early in the season. Eight species accounted for .gtoreq. 90% of the emergence. Five of these, Gymnometriocnemus (R.) acigus Saeth., Doithrix villosa Saeth. and Subl., Pseudorthocladius (s.s.) destitutus Saeth. and Subl., P. (s.s.) curtistylus (Goetgh.), and Paramerina nr. smithae (Subl.) had univoltine life cycles and relatively stichronous emergences. Pseudosmittia forcipata (Goetgh.) was bivoltine, and Limnophyes minimus (Meig.) and Smittia nr. nudipennis Geotgh. had protracted emergence periods that made voltinism difficult to determine. Characteristic features of the chironomid fauna of peatlands at ELA are discussed. The general applicability of these features of peatlands, and needs for further research in these neglected but extensive Canadian habitats are considered.																			0105-9327					FEB	1988	11	1					19	31																WOS:A1988M567300003
J	Jury, MR				Jury, Mark R.			Warm spells on the East African plateau and impacts in the White Nile basin	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												This study analyzes warm spells in the dry season over the East African plateau. Lake levels were observed to decline in the period July 2004 to January 2007. The warmest spell was identified using maximum temperature and satellite outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) observations averaged over Uganda: 20-22 Feb 2005. Meteorological conditions in that case were dominated by a surge of the NE monsoon from the Arabian Sea toward East Africa. Subsiding air induced daytime land surface temperatures > 55 A degrees C. Dry easterly winds swept across Uganda, and the vegetation fraction dropped > 10% in 1 month. At the seasonal scale, the NE monsoon intensity over the Arabian Sea correlated with indices of desiccation over the White Nile basin. In the annual cycle, sensible heat flux follows potential evaporation, reaching -4.5 mm/day in February. Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) model projections favor a long-term weakening of the NE monsoon and a northward migration of the equatorial trough over the west Indian Ocean in Dec-Mar season. Although maximum temperatures are projected to rise +2 A degrees C by the end of the 21st century, the length of the dry season could shrink, thus maintaining the water balance near current levels.																			0177-798X	1434-4483				JUL	2018	133	1-2					595	603		10.1007/s00704-017-2195-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-017-2195-5													WOS:000436245600045
J	Hua, W; Yong, P				Hua, Wang; Yong, Pang			Investigation of Internal Pollutant Loading for a Tide-Influenced Waterbody	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												Based on laboratory experiments and field investigations, the relationship between internal pollutant release intensity and water velocity was determined for Neijiang, a representative waterbody. A two-dimension, unsteady hydrodynamic water quality model coupled with internal pollutant release was established and validated to assess Neijiang in different, typical years and at different tidal cycles. The internal-to-external pollutant loading ratio (IEPLR) was proposed in this paper for the first time to identify the temporal distribution of the effect induced by internal pollutant loading on the water environment. It was found that the annual internally released amounts of total nitrogen, total phosphorous, and chemical oxygen demand (COD) in the high-water year (1998) was 484.0 Mg, 405.3 Mg, and 1928.3 Mg, respectively, which was 27% greater than levels found in the typical-water year (2001) and the dry-water year (2004). Internal pollutant loading in the three typical years showed marked temporal variation; the high-water year displayed the most asymmetrical distribution. Internally released total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and COD during the tidal cycle of flood season was 1.374 Mg, 1.059 Mg, and 4.456 Mg, respectively, which was approximately 55.9% higher than dry season. External pollutant loading on Neijiang was the significant factor influencing water quality because the mean IEPLRs in the three typical years and the tidal cycles were less than one. However, because of the enhanced intensity of internal pollutant release, there were still 124 d in 1998, 22 d in 2001, and 38 d in 2004 when IEPLRs were greater than one; during these days a sudden algae bloom or water quality saltation might occur in Neijiang.

It is frequently dominant and can grow in an emergent form from 0.cntdot.7 m above the water a submerged from 1.cntdot.3 m in length, to depths of c.3m. Plant biomass is generally high with little seasonal cessation of growth. The habit is frequently a dense sward growth which smothers out other flora; it is present in c. ten reserves and is causing concern. It is widely available from aquatic suppliers, it has an enormous potential to propagate from small fragments and has a high growth rate. It is associated with soft sediments and possibly iron-rich areas; this is confirmed by growth trials in static water tanks. In flowing water tirals, growth was even faster in water velocities up to 0.cntdot.32 m s-1, indicating its potential.sbd.although no river sites in Britain are yet known. Control by physical removal, often recommended, results in numerous propagules and should be combined with a secondary technique. This initial study suggests that this plant will remain a problem and caution is required to prevent its further spread. Studies of techniques for its control are needed.																			0006-3207	1873-2917					1987	42	4					247	272		10.1016/0006-3207(87)90071-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0006-3207(87)90071-1													WOS:A1987L111300001
J	Zingel, P; Paaver, T				Zingel, P; Paaver, T			Quick springtime changes in community structure of pelagic ciliated protozoa	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Quick changes in community composition and population dynamics of planktonic ciliates were studied in the ponds of two fish farms obtaining water from different sources (from a fast flowing river or a stillwater reservoir). Samples were taken at two-day intervals during a short period after springtime filling of the ponds. At the beginning of the investigation period the community in the lotic ponds was dominated by species that favour periphyton or benthos as their habitat. They were gradually replaced by euplanktonic species. In the lentic ponds euplanktonic species dominated throughout our study. The similarity index ISJ between lotic ponds and their inflow was 0.67 at the start of our study but decreased to 0.2 during 14 days. If the inflow was from a stillwater reservoir, the similarity index decreased only moderately. In the lotic ponds ciliate community shifted from bacterivory to algivory while in the case of lentic ponds the situation was the opposite - algivorous species were gradually replaced by bacterivores. Abiotic and biotic factors that determine ciliate community structure were separated. The abiotic features are ruling when the system goes through major changes (in our study the lotic pond system where water flow ceased dramatically). The biotic factors are crucial in more stable systems (in our study the lentic pond system) and can change the community structure in same degree as the abiotic ones.

HCB Sampling also included 10 earlier months. Sites were located to give broad coverage to Michigan and, in three cases, to measure variations in concentration near one of the Great Lakes where chlorobenzenes are compounds of concern. The TeCB isomers show high concentrations at every site at various times. The ratio between 1,2,3,4- and 1,2,4,5-TeCB isomers is approximately 2 for most sampling dates, including both high and background concentrations. One significant variation occurs statewide because of a higher concentration of 1,2,4,5-TeCB. At the South Haven site PeCB concentrations are much higher than other sites during June and July. One date of extreme PeCB concentration at South Haven corresponds to high levels of both TeCB isomers, suggesting a similar source. HCB concentrations have a greater range of values during warmer seasons, suggesting that there are a variety of sources to Michigan, some of which are affected by seasonal air temperature variations.

Although seasonality was very pronounced in all experimental systems, the use of net bags (hapas) improved fry yield to 24.7 +/- 27.90, 0-354 fry female(-1) month(-1). Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that the depth of ponds, solar radiation, rainfall and maximum temperature significantly influenced fry and fingerling production (adjusted R-2=0.75; P=0.0024). Injection of exogenous hormones intramuscularly (pimozide, LH-RHa) induced spawning and significantly (P < 0.05) improved spawning success to a maximum of 998 fry female(-1) month(-1). As in other cultured tilapias, when placed in fine-meshed net bags, broodstock density was critical to fry production. A density of 1.0 fish m(-2) for broodfish of 120-200 g produced significantly larger numbers of progeny in the hatchery system employed. Spawning was seasonal and restricted to November-February. Broodfish ponds given inputs of chicken layers' mash produced significantly (P < 0.05) higher numbers of fry and fingerlings than maize bran (4.17 os. 1.22 fry m(-2) female(-1) month(-1)).					; Costa-Pierce, Barry/H-5069-2011	Costa-Pierce, Barry Antonio/0000-0003-3059-1828; 													1355-557X					FEB	1997	28	2					87	99																WOS:A1997WV29800001

Laboratory enrichment of lake water with nutrients resulted in an increased abundance of nannoplankton with the cyanobacteria Gloeocapsa minor predominating. The dominant species of zooplankton showed contrasting responses to enrichment: the abundance of Bosmina longirostris increased, whereas that of Ceriodaphnia dubia decreased relative to the corresponding controls. The clearance rates for various nannoplankton by these cladocerans were similar, resulting in high niche overlap as estimated by the Pianka index. Life table experiments showed that when fed on a pure suspension of lake flagellates (103 cells ml-1) Ceriodaphnia had a significantly higher average intrinsic rate of natural increase (r) than on a suspension of Gloeocapsa (0.28v. 0.146); in the case of Bosmina no significant differences for the two foods were found (0.182 and 0.141, respectively). The contrasting responses of the animals to enrichment are explained by the differing suitability of particular nannoplankton species as food for different cladoceran species. The seasonal succession in the species composition and food quality of nannoplankton may be important for the coexistence of competing zooplankters in lakes.

Within the EUROMAARS EEC program, four cores were drilled in the centre of the lake in September 1990 by the laboratoire de Geologie du Quaternaire (Marseille, France).

In addition to the studies of the EUROMAARS program (sedimentology, palynology, magnetostratigraphy), a geochemical and petrographic study of the organic matter was performed by the Research Group << Relations et Processus Organo-mineraux en Environments Sedimentaires >> (GdR 942 du CNRS), in order to precisely document the variations of the organo-mineral sedimentation features as a function of changing palaeoclimates during the late Quaternary. In its first approach, the aim of the study was to determine the variations of the total organic carbon content (COT), as well as the geochemical and optical nature of the organic matter using Rock Eval pyrolysis and the optical examination of palynofacies. The goal of this paper is to present these first preliminary results. Although a careful interpretation of the results will require a comparison with the sedimentological, palynological and magnetostratigraphic studies, which are now in progress, some conclusions can be brought out: (1) important variations in the COT, as well in the geochemical and petrographic nature of the organic matter, indicate that the organic sedimentation is very sensitive either to long term or short term climatic changes recorded in the sequence; (2) the major glacial intervals are most often characterized by sediments with low COT values (< 1%) and which comprise a degraded amorphous organic matter; the interglacial intervals show higher COT values and a relatively well preserved organic matter composed of mixed elements such as amorphous flakes, lignaceous plant debris, cuticles, spores and pollens; (3) very high COT values (up to 20%), generally associated to high hydrogen index values (up to 800 mg HC/g C.O.), are attributed to the cumulative effects of a major interglacial period and of seasonal events which promoted the accumulation of spores, pollens or cuticles. Further studies will attempt to determine the palaeoclimatic influences on the amorphous organic matter sources (phytoplanktonic or terrestrial source), on the variabilities of organic matter preservation, and to evaluate the organic carbon burial rate on the basis of well established sediment chronology.					; Tribovillard, Nicolas/B-6185-2009	Tribovillard, Nicolas/0000-0003-3493-5579; 													0037-9409	1777-5817					1992	163	4					427	433																WOS:A1992JF84900007
J	GROSSNICKLE, NE				GROSSNICKLE, NE			FEEDING-HABITS OF MYSIS-RELICTA - AN OVERVIEW	HYDROBIOLOGIA												M. relicta was recognized as an important component of many limnetic food webs. The 1st approach to studying the feeding habits of M. relicta was the analysis of stomach contents. Assumptions regarding stomach content analysis were tested and seasonal feeding estimates of M. relicta were reported recently. Laboratory grazing and/or predation experiments have recently been completed using M. relicta primarily from Lakes Michigan and Tahoe [USA]. M. relicta is opportunistic, capable of utilizing a variety of food resources. It may play an important role in structuring limnetic food webs.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1982	93	1-2					101	107		10.1007/BF00008103	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008103													WOS:A1982PH64800012
J	Mathew, BB; Kirshnamurthy, NB				Mathew, Blessy Baby; Kirshnamurthy, Nideghatta Beeregowda			A study on the groundwater of Peenya industrial area and its related elements in Bengaluru region of Karnataka State, India	ENVIRONMENTAL & SOCIO-ECONOMIC STUDIES												Groundwater samples were collected from the Peenya Industrial area of Bengaluru, India to test its quality, elemental composition and inherent bacterial population. Further analysis was done using GIS Based Geostatistical techniques to study the level of groundwater and to generate various maps of lineament, digital elevation, geomorphology, soil erosion, salt affected areas and water logging in this region. Physical and chemical parameters such as Total Dissolved Solids, pH, temperature, BOD, COD, metal ions present in the water samples were studied along with predominant microbial constituents. The Total Dissolved Solids and Total Hardness were far beyond the maximum concentration levels. Further analysis of the isolated bacteria was done using staining methods and biochemical tests. The results obtained showed that the area under study had wells ranging from shallow to deep heights of 30 to 80 meters, with a wide variety of 10-400 LPM; whereas the lineament map suggested that the area was bound with parallel ridges and joints. The geographical data represented pediplain complexes, anthropogenic terrains and water bodies. The area was found to go through a seasonal water logging and the soil loss was due to sheet erosion and rill erosion. It was also observed that the groundwater was contaminated with heavy metals such as lead, chromium etc. along with a diversified bacterial population.					; Mathew, Blessy/HRE-4349-2023	Mathew, Blessy Baby/0000-0002-1302-8251; 													2354-0079					JUN	2018	6	2					1	12		10.2478/environ-2018-0009	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/environ-2018-0009													WOS:000441222700001
J	van der Schriek, T; Giannakopoulos, C				van der Schriek, Tim; Giannakopoulos, Christos			Tracing climate-driven water level fluctuations of Lake Prespa (Greece) to lacustrine beach ridge sediments: a modern case study to facilitate past lake level reconstruction	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												The Prespa Lake Basin (southwestern Balkans) contains a unique Holocene beach ridge record, which offers the opportunity to reliably reconstruct past water-level fluctuations based on absolute geomorphic stage index points. Such lake-level records are of great value for generating robust (quantified) hydro-climatic interpretations. These are urgently required for the Balkans, located at the juncture of contrasting Mediterranean climate and hydrological domains, as the few regional lake-proxy records covering the past millennium lack chronological resolution and appear to show different timing of wet-dry episodes. In order to use lake stage records for past climate change reconstructions, it is vital to understand modern lake-level sensitivity to specific hydro-climatic events and to track this signal to the landform-sediment archive. Accordingly, this paper analyses the impact of recent hydro-climate variability on the level of Lake Megali Prespa and traces this water-level signal to modern beach ridge sediments to facilitate future lake-level reconstructions. Annual lake fluctuations are strongly related to cumulative wet season precipitation which is highly correlated to the North Atlantic Oscillation. Lake Prespa reacts to sustained water balance changes by adjusting its lake surface area and thus surface evaporation. Historical water levels fluctuated between 853 and 842 m. Within this height range, lake surface areas change abruptly at 853-852, 847-846 and < 842 m. At stage levels in between these thresholds, set by the bathymetry, lake surface area only changes marginally and hydro-climatic conditions are approximately stable. This study finds that lake-level fluctuations are reliably registered by lacustrine beach sediment facies. Major lake level movements, which cross bathymetric thresholds, are clearly registered in the sediment-stratigraphic record by characteristic truncation surfaces and deposits. The chronological resolution of this lake-level record, and therefore the hydro-climatic signal it contains, is up to decadal timescales. Establishing quantified hydrological change estimates from the Prespa beach-ridge record requires knowledge of lake surface areas at specific lake stage index points. Modern analogues will give the difference in annually evaporated lake water volume between key stages. These differences are approximately equivalent to the change in water input (precipitation and discharge) and/or water loss (evaporation).

Based on laboratory experiment, field investigation and numerical simulation, the spatial distributions of suspended sediment (SS) under the gravityflow, jacking-flow and back-flow patterns were quantitatively analysed. An annular flume experiment was conducted to determine the critical starting shear stresses of the sediments in the flood and dry seasons. By numerical experiment, the SS transport under different flow patterns was explored. Several results stand out. (1) The critical starting shear stresses of the sediments in the flood and dry seasons were 0.35 N.m(-2) and 0.29 N.m(-2), respectively. (2) Due to the strongest flow disturbance and scouring effect, SS under the gravity-flow pattern was characterized by the highest loads. The lowest SS was observed during the jacking-flow pattern, which could be attributed to the lowest water level gap between the lake and external rivers. The loads ranged from 0.053 kg.m(-3) to 0.068 kg.m(-3). (3) Under the back-flow pattern, SS in the north lake was evidently influenced by the Yangtze River, and the mean value was approximately 0.12 kg.m(-3). With the gradually weakened back-flow impact, the SS load was decreased from the north to the middle of the lake.																			1606-9749					JUN	2018	18	3					994	1004		10.2166/ws.2017.167	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/ws.2017.167													WOS:000437347600024
