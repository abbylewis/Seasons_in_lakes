Mixing potential of a surface-mounted solar-powered water mixer (SWM) for controlling cyanobacterial blooms	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Cyanobacterial blooms continue to be a serious nuisance to water quality managers, and remedial measures that are ecologically sound, economically feasible, and efficient in responding to the scale and intensity of the problem are required for their control. Here, we evaluated the potential of a new technique to adequately mix the water column and control cyanobacterial blooms, employing a surface-mounted solar-powered water mixer (SWM). Flow dynamics, thermal structure of the water column and phytoplankton photo-physiology were compared before and during operation of the SWM in Falling Creek Reservoir to determine whether the device helps weaken thermal stratification, deepen surface mixed layer, and entrain surface cyanobacteria into deeper water to light-limit their growth. Water circulation generated by the SWM resulted in weak velocity fields to a lateral distance of 5 m from the device, to a depth of 1.5 m from the surface. Moreover, the mixing minimized the surface water temperatures by approximately 2 C and deepened the surface mixed layer by 1 m up to a lateral distance of 3 m from the SWM, but little change occurred beyond this distance even after continuous operation of the device for more than a week. Photo-physiological observations also suggested light-limitation in cyanobacterial growth up to a lateral distance of 5 m from SWM during intense sunlight conditions. The results showed that the SWM has limited zone of influence and is unable to adequately mix lakes and reservoirs to effectively control cyanobacterial blooms. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Patterns of tidal flooding within a mangrove forest: Coombabah Lake, Southeast Queensland, Australia	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Tidal flooding and surface drainage patterns have often been used to describe mangrove species zonation. However, in mangrove forests exhibiting little topography, ambiguous species distributions and/or few species, such approaches are ineffective. We identified four physiognomic mangrove forest types (Riverine, Fringing, Overwash and Basin) at Coombabah Lake, a tidal lake in southeast Queensland, Australia and investigated tidal flooding patterns using synoptic surveys of tidal observations at the local Standard Port combined with local water depth observation. Subsequently three sub-types of the basin forest type were identified: (1) Deep Basin Forest with mature trees, similar to 50 cm standing water and similar to 3 tides per year; (2) Medium Depth Basin Forest with intermediate tree development, similar to 15-30 cm standing water and 20-40 tides per year; and (3) Shallow Basin Forest with relatively recent mangrove establishment, 5-15 cm standing water and similar to 80 tides per year. These three basin sub-types were found to flood at different tide heights with the Shallow Basin flooding for tides above mean high water springs and the Deep Basin flooding only for tide heights approaching the highest astronomical tide. We propose that these basin types represent a succession in mangrove forest development that corresponds with increasing water depth and tree maturation over time. The succession not only represents increasing age but also change in basin substrate composition. This is manifest as increasing pneumatophore density and an increasing area of basin surface occupied by contiguous pneumatophore cover. As a result, it seems that mangrove development is able to modify tidal flooding into the basin by increasingly impeding water movement. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Thus, understanding their physiological responses and evaluating ecosystem impacts is crucial. The study investigates adaptive responses to oxidative stress in the invasive Sinanodonta woodiana in Lake Candia (northwest Italy). This approach represents a novel perspective in environmental monitoring, utilizing invasive species to gain insights into ecosystem health and potential ecological threats. The investigation delved into oxidative stress biomarkers, including superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione S-transferase, glyoxalase I, glyoxalase II, and lactate dehydrogenase, in mussel tissues (gills and digestive gland). Concurrently, environmental factors such as temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, and conductivity were measured at four stations in Lake Candia during the summer. Environmental factors exhibited homogeneity across selected stations, with positive correlations observed only for temperature and conductivity with catalase and glyoxalase I. A distinct pattern of oxidative stress response was consistently observed in both mussel tissues throughout the sampling period across all monitoring stations, with more pronounced alterations observed in one specific station. This observation aligns with IBRv2 scores, indicating the station's highest impact. Gills exhibited a transient and severe oxidative stress response, while heightened antioxidant defenses in digestive glands suggested the adaptive ability of Chinese pond mussels to environmental disturbances. Proactive inclusion of invasive species in biomonitoring programs reduces reliance on native populations, enhancing strategies for controlling non-native mussels in protected areas like Lake Candia.

The MOMENTUM study is a pragmatic cohort investigation designed to measure the "Three Delays", i.e. delays in recognizing need for care (Type 1), reaching care (Type 2), and receiving care (Type 3) within a remote island health system on Lake Victoria, Kenya. The study utilizes an adaptive methodology to provide actionable data for a locally-directed "Health Navigation" intervention. We present analysis of 56 maternal and neonatal emergency cases occurring between January 2019 and February 2020. The mean Total Delay Interval (Type 1-3) reported was 39.3 +/- 32.3hours. Notably, 18 cases in this cohort resulted in a neonatal (n = 16) or maternal death (n = 2). Sub-analysis indicates significant delay interval reductions associated with involvement of a "Health Navigator" in emergency care coordination for Type 2 Delay Intervals (0.5 +/- 0.3 vs. 1.2 +/- 1.1 hrs., p = 0.002) and Type 3 Delay Intervals (17.9 +/- 14.1 vs. 32.9 +/- 33.7 hrs., p = 0.030). Prolonged delays, complex barriers, and high mortality highlight the fraught nature of maternal emergencies in this remote setting. We discuss practical considerations for application of the Three Delays model, and avenues for further investigation.

Characteristics and paleoenvironmental significance of a thin, dual-sourced loess sheet, north-central Wisconsin	AEOLIAN RESEARCH												We provide the first extensive data on the characteristics, distribution, and origin(s) of a thin but extensive loess sheet in north-central Wisconsin, USA. Unlike the relatively thick loess deposits downwind of broad meltwater valleys that reflect ice sheet dynamics, thin loess sheets far from such rivers may provide unique information about local paleoenvironmental change due to their smaller, and often environmentally sensitive, source areas. Silt loam textured and thin (<35 cm thick) on its eastern margins, loess in north-central Wisconsin thickens (to >70 cm) and coarsens towards the west and northwest, such that, on its western margins, the loess mantle is dominated by very fine and fine sands. Collectively, data on loess particle size distributions, thickness, and silt mineralogy suggest that this loess sheet had sources in two distinct and disjunct landscapes: (1) the late Wisconsin terminal moraine to the northwest, and (2) the sandstone-dominated landscapes to the west and southwest. Post-glacial thawing of these permafrost-affected landscapes probably led to draining of ice-walled lake plains on and behind the moraine, as well as destabilization of slopes on the sandstone landscape; in both cases, exposing large quantities of sediment for deflation. Our study makes two significant contributions to aeolian research: (1) we determine that the north-central Wisconsin loess sheet, unlike almost all others, has two distinctly different and disjunct loess sources, and (2) neither of these two loess sources fall within the traditional mode of "glacial meltwater valley."

Source and longevity of streambed sediment and phosphorus retention in a lake-plain tributary of the Maumee River	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We described abundance and source of soft, fine-grained, streambed sediment and associated phosphorus (sed-P) during summer low flow in Little Flatrock Creek (LFR), a channelized tributary of the Maumee River and western Lake Erie. Reach-level assessments compared streambed-sediment storage to streambank erosion. Streambed sediment was fingerprinted and analyzed for sed-P and the potential for P de/sorption between the water column and streambed sediment. The ratio of two fallout radionuclides apportioned "new sediment" in streambed storage. Basin-wide streambed-sediment storage exceeded both annual streambank erosion and the annual suspended-sediment load. Streambed sediment was generally a mix of streambank and cropland sources and each equaled or exceeded abundance of new streambed sediment, indicating accumulation of sediment from both sources during the current agricultural cycle. The implication is that this mix of new and old sediment, and legacy P, takes multiple events and seasons to be transported downstream. Streambed sediment had the potential to adsorb dissolved P (DP) from the water column, with sed-P stored in the silt + clay fraction similar to the annual particulate-P (total-dissolved) load transported with suspended sediment, but with lower concentrations than cropland- and streambank-sourced sediment. This indicates supplementation of water-column DP as sediment settles to the bottom and a lag between land and channel management and in-channel P availability. Storage of fine-grained sediment and sed-P in this lake-plain/bed basin is distinct from another Maumee headwater tributary with glacial-moraine controlled geomorphology. The implication is that streambank erosion, in-channel sediment accumulation, and the resultant total-dissolved-sediment P spiral differ based on geomorphic setting and drainage history.

J	Quist, MC; Pember, KR; Guy, CS; Stephen, JL				Quist, MC; Pember, KR; Guy, CS; Stephen, JL			Variation in larval fish communities: implications for management and sampling designs in reservoir systems	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												Understanding spatial and temporal patterns in larval fish distributions is important for investigating factors related to recruitment variability and for developing sampling methodologies. Variation in species diversity (Shannon index) and density (number 100 m(-3)) of larval fishes from nearshore and pelagic habitats in Glen Elder Reservoir, KS, USA, was assessed during 1999 and 2000. Species diversity and densities of individual taxa were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in nearshore habitats than pelagic habitats during both years. Larval fish densities were generally higher in the year 1999 with higher spring water levels. Gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum (Lesueur) was the most abundant taxon in nearshore and pelagic habitats during both years. In addition, larval gizzard shad was sampled for the longest duration in the upper water column and overlapped with all taxa collected. High densities of gizzard shad in both habitats suggested that the potential for competitive interactions was high, especially given the lack of aquatic vegetation and habitat heterogeneity in littoral habitats. Most of the variation in larval fish diversity and density was because of temporal variation. If sampling effort must be limited and the purpose of sampling is to monitor larval diversity or density, attention should focus on sampling the same location over long time periods rather than across a variety of sampling locations.																			0969-997X					APR	2004	11	2					107	116		10.1046/j.1365-2400.2003.00381.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2400.2003.00381.x													WOS:000220069800006
J	Bester, K				Bester, K			Polycyclic musks in the Ruhr catchment area - transport, discharges of waste water, and transformations of HHCB, AHTN and HHCB-lactone	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING												The polycyclic musk fragrance compounds HHCB (1,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydro-4,6,6,7,8,8-hexamethylcyclopenta-(g)-2-benzopyran; trade name, e.g. galaxolide(R)) and AHTN (7-acetyl-1,1,3,4,4,6-hexamethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene, trade name, e.g. tonalide(R)) and the transformation product of HHCB (HHCB-lactone) were analysed in surface water samples and sewage treatment plants (STP) effluents in the Ruhr megalopolis. The STPs were the dominant source for these pollutants. In the part of the river where the drinking water is extracted from the river, about 60 ng L-1 HHCB, 10 ng L-1 AHTN and 20-30 ng L-1 HHCB-lactone were found as typical riverine concentrations, while none of the compounds were detected near the spring of the river. On the other hand sewage treatment plant effluents exhibited concentrations up to 600 ng L-1. The STP's effluent resulted in elevated concentrations in some parts of the river and in the lakes into which they discharge. As some of the plants emit HHCB-lactone with a significantly changed enantiomeric pattern, biotransformation of HHCB to HHCB-lactone occurs in some waste water treatment plants operating with activated sludge. In those parts of the river where no relevant discharges of waste water or fresh water takes place neither the concentration nor the pattern changes significantly. This holds true especially for the HHCB versus HHCB-lactone ratios which indicates degradation less than 15% of the HHCB inventory in the river Ruhr itself. In other rivers, such as the Rhine, higher levels of HHCB-lactone in comparison to HHCB were detected (ratio 1 : 1).					; Bester, Kai/D-2526-2012	Bester, Kai/0000-0001-6348-416X; 													1464-0325					JAN	2005	7	1					43	51		10.1039/b409213a	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b409213a								15614401					WOS:000226926700011

The .tau. values were 10-1000 times longer than those observed in the epilimnia and hypolimnia of 2 lakes being experimentally enriched in northwestern Ontario [Canada] (Experimental Lakes Area) in the same summer. Algal populations in the Experimental Lakes Area exhibited short .tau. values over a large range of temperature and light values, which exceeded the ranges of temperatures and light intensities measured in northern Manitoba. In northern Manitoba the shortest .tau. values occurred in July when an independent indicator of sestonic P deficiency, the particular alkaline phosphatase activity per unit weight ATP, measured moderate to severe P deficiency. In Sept. in northern Manitoba, .tau. values were at least 10 times greater than in July and were among the highest reported in the literature. The 2-yr-old Notigi Reservoir had the highest .tau. values in both July and Sept., and it deviated strongly from the expected chlorophyll-P relation to north temperate lakes. These new reservoirs in northern Manitoba are not P limited and even the natural lakes may be only moderately P limited.

ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES ON AMPHIBIAN ASSEMBLAGES ACROSS SUBALPINE WET MEADOWS IN THE KLAMATH MOUNTAINS, CALIFORNIA	HERPETOLOGICA												Many high-elevation regions in the western USA are protected public lands that remain relatively undisturbed by human impact. Over the last century, however, nonnative trout and cattle have been introduced to subalpine wetland habitats used by sensitive amphibian species. Our study compares the relative importance of cattle and trout impact on amphibian assemblages, abundance, and occupancy within a broader context of high-elevation environmental variables. We evaluated amphibian species richness and abundance across 89 subalpine wet meadow sites in the Klamath Mountains of Northern California, USA. At each wet meadow we also measured environmental characteristics including wilderness designation, elevation, meadow size, number of pools, distance to nearest lake, presence of nonnative trout, and impact of cattle. Cluster analysis found amphibian assemblages fell into three distinct groups, and ordination suggested the number of pools, elevation, and presence of nonnative trout are significant site variables associated with species groups in wet meadows. Individual species differed in population response to environmental characteristics. Regression trees and occupancy models indicated that the most-important variables associated with the population size and site occupancy of individual amphibian species are nonnative trout, wilderness area designation, the number of pools, and the distance to the nearest lake. While nonnative trout exhibited a strongly negative correlation with amphibian assemblages, abundance, and occupancy, cattle impact was only weakly associated with occupancy and abundance of some species.					; North, Malcolm/AAW-8897-2020	Adelsheim, Esther/0000-0002-5400-2445; North, Malcolm/0000-0002-9090-784X; 													0018-0831	1938-5099				JUN	2014	70	2					135	148		10.1655/HERPETOLOGICA-D-13-00016	http://dx.doi.org/10.1655/HERPETOLOGICA-D-13-00016													WOS:000336047900002

Fish of all three size classes fed mostly from post-dusk to dawn, with larger fish tending to consume a greater proportion of their prey during night-time. The number of prey taxa consumed increased with increasing size of fish. Prey selection indices indicated that: (I) the smallest eels (80-100 mm total length, TL) preferentially consumed ostracods (Crustacea) and larvae of Chironomidae (Diptera) and Psilochorema sp. (free-living Trichoptera); (2) medium-sized eels (101-199 mm TL) preferred larvae of Chironomidae, and Costachorema sp., Hydrobiosis sp. and Psilochorema sp.; and (3) large eels (200-300 mm TL) preferred ostracods, Psilochorema sp. and Hudsonema amabilis (cased Trichoptera). Eels of all size classes showed selection for soft-bodied or easily broken prey over those with hard cases which would have been more difficult to digest. There was considerable overlap in the diets of medium and large eels. Differences in the timing of feeding between the three size classes of eel are explained in terms of microhabitat use; differences in diet are explained in terms of prey size, and are also related to eel size.																			1323-1650						1998	49	5					421	428		10.1071/MF97154	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF97154													WOS:000076679500010

Early use of northern pike was unregulated consumptive harvest. Pike anglers today vary from those interested in intense harvest, to winter spear fisheries, to those interested in catching trophy fish. Michigan pike are now managed within three ecological groupings: 1. High density and slow growing populations, managed to increase harvest and reduce density (managed with a daily bag limit of 5 fish and no size limit). 2. Moderate density populations with normal growth (most populations, managed with a 61-cm (24-in) size limit and creel of 2 fish per day). 3. Low density and rapid growing populations (managed for trophy fisheries with a 76-cm (30-in) size limit and restricted take). Recent management challenges also include loss of wetland-spawning habitat, driving a need for stocking to supplement natural reproduction. Michigan has managed spawning marshes and other habitat to produce northern pike from natural waters, and recent demand has led to hatchery production of fry. Technology for hatchery production has moved from extensively growing pike and stocking at a small size to the current system using pelleted feed, growing fish to a larger size at a lower density. Future plans for pike management in Michigan are even more focused on using ecology as a means to manage lakes and streams, but will require much more research to be feasible.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				APR	2008	601						125	135		10.1007/s10750-007-9259-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-007-9259-y													WOS:000253200500012

This species has 2 kinds of development one simple with a single generation per yr and a single period of successful reproduction (in spring), the other more complex with 2 generations/yr and 2 periods or reproduction (June-July and Aug.-Nov.). These differences in the life cycle can be related to water chemistry: the hard, alkaline waters of the St. Lawrence River and the soft and neutral waters of the Outaouais River. The growth of individuals fits a sigmoid curve and shows intraspecific and annual variations which can be explained by differences in the trophic nature of the habitat rather than by physicochemical variations. L. catascopium catascopium lays 2 kinds of egg masses and is sexually mature at a length < 10 mm. Its fecundity estimated for the period 18 June 1970 to 23 Nov. 1971 varied from 3380 to 43,674 eggs depending on the population. In the laboratory, each animal laid 273-690 eggs at 15.degree.

J	Seppa, H				Seppa, H			The long-term development of urban vegetation in Helsinki, Finland: A pollen diagram from Toolonlahti	VEGETATION HISTORY AND ARCHAEOBOTANY												A core from Toolonlahti, a bay close to the central business district of Helsinki, the capital of Finland, was analysed for its pollen stratigraphy. The extrapolated age-depth curve based on Cs-137 dating, sphaeroidal carbonaceous particle analysis and historical data suggests that the core goes back to the 17th or early 18th century. Four local pollen assemblage zones (LPAZ) were identified. Detrended correspondence analysis was used to detect the main phases of change represented by these zones. The basal LPAZ indicates that the vegetation was characterized by forest dominated by Pinus sylvestris and Picea abies during the early history of the city of Helsinki and that human impact remained relatively minor until the end of the 19th century. A drastic change in vegetation took place at the turn of the 19/20th century when both Pinus and Picea declined rapidly while pollen values of several anthropogenic indicators rose. These changes were synchronous with the rapid expansion of population and urban area in Helsinki. Rarefaction analysis shows that palynological richness was highest during the early phase of increased human impact but then started to fall.

Landscape evolution of the Ganga-Sai interfluve in response to river dynamics and Late Pleistocene-Holocene climate change via a meander cut-off lake of a plains-fed channel	GEOMORPHOLOGY												The floodplains in the interfluve between the Ganga and Sai rivers in the Central Ganga Plains exhibit a broad suite of geomorphic features such as a linear array of meander cut-offs and oxbows representing abandoned sinuous channels. Here we integrate regional and local scale geomorphic analysis using satellite imageries with detailed chronostratigraphic and paleoclimatic reconstruction from a large oxbow lake (Baraila Tal) in the paleochannel belt to infer landscape evolution in this region. The stratigraphic succession at Baraila Tal supported by sedimentology and stable isotope composition of organic matter and micro-gastropod shells suggests that the lake was previously a part of an active fluvial system, and the depositional environment transformed from a fluvial to a lacustrine system in response to geomorphic and climatic changes during the post-LGM period. Integrating geomorphic and paleoclimatic data, we identify four stages (I -IV) of landscape evolution in the Ganga-Sai interfluve region during the Late Pleistocene-Holocene interval: (I) active channel phase of paleo-Sai river before 12 kyr, (II) development of paleochannel belt and meander cut-offs during 12-8 kyr, (III) development of 'misfit' Sai river and gullied landscape during 8-7 kyr, and (IV) expansion of ephemeral lakes (wetlands) and subsequent filling post 7 kyr. We have demonstrated the use of paleoclimate and paleovegetation data retrieved from a meander cut-off lake for deciphering landscape evolution.

Isotopic Composition and Origin of Sulfide and Sulfate Species of Sulfur in Thermal Waters of Jiangxi Province (China)	AQUATIC GEOCHEMISTRY												The reduced sulfur species, sulfide, elemental and thiosulfate were considered in the thermal waters of Jiangxi Province for the first time. It is shown that the sulfur speciation content significantly varies and depends on the pH values. The major part of reduced sulfur refers to sulfide species in the nitric thermal waters, to elemental-in the carbon dioxide thermal waters. The presence of both reduced and oxidized sulfur speciation indicates the possibility of sulfide minerals hydrolysis and disproportionation of the product of this reaction (SO2) with the participation of hot water with the formation of elemental and sulfate sulfur. The isotopic composition of dissolved sulfate and sulfide sulfur speciation has shown that the process of bacterial reduction proceeds in the thermal waters, accompanied by accumulation of relatively heavy sulfur isotope in sulfates. Simultaneously with reduction, the oxidation of both sulfide minerals and newly formed hydrosulfide proceeds with formation of elemental, thiosulfates and also sulfates in the discharge zone was proceeded. It is shown that the process of sulfide oxidation mostly occurs in carbon dioxide thermal waters. Therefore, the elemental sulfur is predominant in carbon dioxide waters. The oxidation process is less significant in the nitric thermal waters, whereby the concentrations of sulfide ion are higher than sulfates. The ambiguous effect of sulfate reduction on the hydrogeochemical environment of the thermal waters is confirmed by the differing value of the carbon isotope ratio of HCO3- in the considered waters. The obtained isotopic composition data (34)delta S(SO42-) indicate host rocks as a source of sulfates in the thermal waters of Jiangxi Province.

J	Akitomo, K; Tanaka, K				Akitomo, Kazunori; Tanaka, Kiyoshi			A 40-year numerical experiment of circulations in Lake Biwa (1): summer gyre systems	LIMNOLOGY												A 40-year numerical experiment has been executed on flow and water temperature fields of Lake Biwa, Japan. We have analyzed the results to clarify detailed properties of gyre systems during a stratified period. The anticlockwise first gyre, FG, and the clockwise second gyre, SG, are usually driven by positive and negative wind stress curl, WSC, respectively, and the former is maintained for more than 10 days without wind forcings because of weak dissipation. Various gyre systems are caused by extratropical cyclones with fronts and typhoons as well as prevailing winds. Regardless of the meteorological disturbances, it is the wind direction or WSC that determines what gyre system is driven. (1) Southeasterlies with positive WSC and north-northwesterlies with negative WSC usually drive the FG and SG, respectively. (2) Northwesterlies which have positive and negative WSC in the northern and southern areas of the lake, respectively, drive the two-gyre system of FG and SG. (3) Strong northerlies with negative WSC sometimes drive the FG indirectly. A strong northward return flow separates from the western shore to form an anticlockwise eddy behind the Ado River Delta, which can develop into the FG. This type of indirect FG formation occurs throughout the experiment with its frequency varying on a decadal scale.																			1439-8621	1439-863X				JAN	2025	26	1					107	124		10.1007/s10201-024-00764-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-024-00764-7		SEP 2024											WOS:001321561100001

Cloud formation processes may have a significant impact on precipitation, especially during the tropical marine processes and summer monsoon which convey abundant water vapor to coastal southern China and inland areas. Here, we use two 7500 year sedimentary records from the Pearl River Delta and the closed Maar Lake, respectively, in coastal southern China to reconstruct the mid-to-late-Holocene humidity variability and explore its possible relationship with cloud cover modulated by the Earth's magnetic fields (EMF). Our proxy records document an apparent increase in wetness in coastal southern China between 3.0 and 1.8 kyr BP. This apparent increase in humidity appears to be consistent with the lower virtual axial dipole moments and, in turn, with a lower EMF. This correlation suggests that the EMF might have been superimposed on the weakened monsoon to regulate the mid-to-late-Holocene hydroclimate in coastal southern China through the medium of galactic cosmic rays, aerosols, and cloud cover. However, further investigations are needed to verify this interaction.					; Yin, Jian/GRO-0159-2022; Zhang, Tingwei/AAK-7302-2020; Yang, Xiao-Qiang/C-6900-2014; Wang, Qiangqiang/AAN-5287-2020	Zhang, Tingwei/0000-0002-9839-4559; 													2095-0195	2095-0209				MAR	2024	18	2					324	335		10.1007/s11707-022-1009-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11707-022-1009-y		FEB 2024											WOS:001173869000001

We investigated the growth characteristics of the dominant pigmented species, the flagellate Chlamydomonas acidophila, in semi-continuous culture experiments under in situ conditions. The following hypotheses were tested: (1) Low inorganic carbon (IC) concentrations in the epilimnion (e.g. 0.3 mg l(-1)) arising from the low pH limit phototrophic growth (H-1); (2) the additional use of dissolved organic carbon (mixotrophy) leads to higher growth rates under IC-limitation (H-2), and (3) phagotrophy is not relevant (H-3). H-1 was supported as the culture experiments, in situ PAR and IC concentrations indicated that IC potentially limited phototrophic growth in the mixed surface layers. H-2 was also supported: mixotrophic growth always exceeded pure phototrophic growth even when photosynthesis was saturated. Dark growth in filtered lake water illuminated prior to inoculation provided evidence that Chlamydomonas was able to use the natural DOC. The alga did not grow on bacteria, thus confirming H-3. Chlamydomonas exhibited a remarkable resistance to starvation in the dark. The compensation light intensity (ca. 20 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1)) and the maximum phototrophic growth (1.50 d(-1)) fell within the range of algae from non-acidic waters. Overall, Chlamydomonas, a typical r-strategist in circum-neutral systems, showed characteristics of a K-strategist in the stable, acidic lake environment in achieving moderate growth rates and minimizing metabolic losses.

Deterioration of water quality has been observed in recent years - the lake was still a in moderate state (III class) in 1997, but now it is in a poor condition (IV class) with low Secchi depth (to 0.3m), high chlorophyll-a content (up to 153 mu g dm(-3)) and cyanobacterial water bloom in summer, dominated by Planktothrix agardhii, Aphanizomenon gracile, Planktolyngbya limnetica and Pseudanabaena limnetica. External nutrient load exceeds 3.4 times the permissible TN load and 2.4 times TP load, according to Vollenweider's criteria. To improve the ecological state of Bielsko Lake protective measures against pollution have been proposed. Treated municipal sewage should be diverted from the lake by the transport to specially prepared filtering fields, which will drain the sewage into the ground. Stormwater should be treated in a sedimentation and biofiltration system before being discharged to the lake. As internal loading from bottom sediments is very high, sustainable restoration was also proposed. Soluble reactive phosphorus in the water column could be inactivated using small and accurately calculated doses of iron sulfate and magnesium chloride. A cascading effect of trophic interactions of the food web on phytoplankton could be obtained using piscivorous fish stocking (biomanipulation method).

In this paper, we refine the methodology for utilizing lakes and bogs downwind of dune fields as precise recorders of past eolian activity. Sediment cores from two Allegan County lakes and one bog associated with dunes were studied to evaluate the importance of the various sand transport pathways into lakes and bogs. Goshorn Lake's western edge directly abuts a large parabolic dune. Sand concentrations decrease in cores away from the dunes, possibly reflecting avalanching into the lake followed by sediment gravity flows along the lake bottom. Sand input from stream flow was minor. The Allegan Bog core records a fenemergent bog transition coincident with a decrease in the sand influx. Poorly understood shoreline processes may have contributed sand to the basin's center before the bog's emergence. Sand in Gilligan Lake cores is texturally similar to adjacent dune sand and the eolian activity history derived from this sand is nearly identical to the history derived from the dune's paleosols and optically stimulated luminescence ages. A proposed lake and bog sampling strategy includes choosing sites in the lee of large dunes edged with emergent vegetation and away from steep slopes or stream inlets. The lake's bathymetry should also be considered. Distinguishing between grain fall sedimentary structures and mass movement or sediment gravity flows is important. This strategy provides relatively high resolution, continuous eolian activity histories that can be correlated with paleoenvironmental proxies from the same cores.

'Episodes', which are periods of depressed alkalinity during hydrological events, have been studied mainly in southeastern Canada, and occur at all sites where there is sufficient time resolution of the observations, viz. Ontario, Quebec and Nova Scotia. An 'alkaline episode', where acidity decreases during an event, has been reported from one lake in the Canadian Artic. There is a bias towards the examination of episodes stimulated by snowmelt or rain-on-snow, since rainfall-stimulated episodes are poorly documented. Pre-event, rather than event, water dominates runoff during episodes. For this reason, biogeochemical reactions and the hydrological flowpaths in operation through the vadose and saturated zones are the principal controls on the chemical characteristics of episodes. Most episodes are dominated by base cation 'dilution' in circumneutral systems, and 'increase in strong acid anions' (particularly sulphate) in acidic systems. Episodes dominated by nitrification or organic acids or stimulated by sea salt input are rare or have not been decumented. Direct input of event water may dominate only during particular circumstances at snowmelt. Then, direct chemical inputs from lake ice and lake snow cover may be of importance in some systems.

J	Lutz, K; Tabone, I; Humbert, A; Braun, M				Lutz, Katrina; Tabone, Ilaria; Humbert, Angelika; Braun, Matthias			Multi-annual patterns of rapidly draining supraglacial lakes in Northeast Greenland	CRYOSPHERE												Supraglacial lakes are known to undergo rapid drainages in which their water masses are drained through ice hydrofracture to the glacier bed, typically within several hours. Despite the impact of this sudden englacial transport of meltwater, the conditions leading up to a rapid drainage are not fully understood. In this study, the spatial and temporal variability of rapid drainages was evaluated over two major glaciers in Northeast Greenland: Zachari ae Isstr & oslash;m and Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden (79N Glacier). Over the 2016-2022 summer melt seasons, supraglacial lakes on these glaciers were tracked via Sentinel-2 optical imagery to find the occurrence of any rapid drainages. The spatial distribution of rapid drainages as well as the seasonal timings was then evaluated against several other factors, such as ice strain rate, elevation, lake volume, and seasonal surface temperature. It was found that the drainage patterns of individual lakes varied substantially, with some lakes having drained only a couple times and others nearly every year in the observed time frame. Furthermore, the temporal consistency and spatial consistency of drainages were also generally inconsistent. Some lakes tended to drain at similar times over the melt years, while others had a more sporadic drainage timing. Similarly, certain clusters of lakes tend to drain in similar time frames, whereas it was found that most lakes did not follow a drainage tendency based on spatial position. However, the phenomenon of cascading drainages, in which neighboring lakes drain nearly simultaneously, was observed several times. While it was seen that drainages tend to occur later with higher elevations, little correlation was found between the occurrence of rapid drainages and the other investigated factors. It appears several conditions would need to be met to allow for a rapid drainage to occur, particularly the existence of fractures or crevasses within the lake boundaries.																			1994-0416	1994-0424				JUL 18	2025	19	7					2601	2614		10.5194/tc-19-2601-2025	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/tc-19-2601-2025													WOS:001530906100001

However, previous studies usually focused on SGLs at regional scale or some typical ice shelves, and underestimated the distribution and area of SGLs. Thus, the current Antarctic-wide SGL distribution and variability information is still limited, and the present status and possible influence on ice shelf stability are also largely unknown. Here, we used more than 110,000 Landsat 8 images to detect SGLs across Antarctica (north of 83 degrees S) in austral summer from 2014 to 2022 by using a well-constructed threshold-based method. Overall, most SGLs were located on ice shelves, covering 79% of the total area; the largest SGL areas were found in East Antarctica (79%, 2222 km2), far exceeding the SGL areas in Antarctic Peninsula (20%, 473 km2) and West Antarctica (1%, 23 km2). SGL area gains and declines were found in the Antarctic Peninsula and West Antarctica, respectively, while East Antarctica experienced relatively high interannual variabilities due to the presence of some ice shelves with asynchronous variation patterns. Larger collapse risks are found for smaller ice shelves; ice shelves in East Antarctica are relatively unstable, and disintegration risk is increasing for some ice shelves in Antarctic Peninsula. Glaciological factors are closely related to the location of SGLs, and temperature, precipitation and winds are strongly linked to SGL evolution. This study is expected to enhance the reliability of existing Antarctic SGL dataset by providing a more comprehensive dataset, and offer detailed insights into the relationship between SGLs, climatic factors, and near-surface conditions. Additionally, it examines the risks of ice shelf collapse caused by SGLs, which is essential for understanding the SGL dynamics and their impacts.																			1674-9278					APR	2025	16	2					337	349		10.1016/j.accre.2025.02.005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.accre.2025.02.005													WOS:001515086800001
J	Hamblin, PF; Gale, P				Hamblin, PF; Gale, P			Water quality modeling of caged aquaculture impacts in Lake Wolsey, North Channel of Lake Huron	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Nutrient release from fish farming could have an impact on water quality in restricted areas of the Great Lakes. Unprecedented hypolimnetic anoxia, discovered in a small bay of the LaCloche Channel in the vicinity of a caged aquaculture operation (Ontario Ministry of Environment, September 1997), stimulated an environmental review by provincial regulators of the increasing number of caged aquaculture operations in the North Channel area of Lake Huron. They found that water exchange rates between the restricted zones around the cages and surrounding waters are a key component in determining assimilative capacity and evaluating potential impacts on water quality. A caged aquaculture operation exists in Lake Wolsey (area 2,315 ha), a restricted embayment along the northwestern shoreline of Manitoulin Island and which ultimately drains into the North Channel of Lake Huron. The morphometry of Lake Wolsey lends itself to the formulation of a simple box model for the change in total phosphorus concentration due to loading from the caged operation and a specified exchange across the entrance of the embayment. Using water level readings at the entrance of the bay, the geometry of the entrance, and a one-dimensional exchange flow model, the exchange was found to be in the order of 14.3 m(3)/s on average. This relatively vigorous exchange is due to the presence of large wind and lunar tides in the North Channel. Such an exchange flow would result in a residence time of 215 days for the 25 in deep basin. Based on an estimated open water season (May to November) loading of 1,352 kg phosphorus for thefish culture operation, the resulting elevation of the total phosphorus concentration would be 5.1 mug/L above the measured background level of 8 mug/L, a total close to that observed, 12 mug/L. Similarly, in the ice-covered season with lower feeding rates the model predicted 7.9 mug/L comparing favorably to the observed spring turnover value of 8.0 mug/L. In Lake Wolsey, the long-term effects of caged aquaculture at its current level of production are probably minimal but in the short-term could result in algal blooms and increased oxygen demand.																			0380-1330						2002	28	1					32	43		10.1016/S0380-1330(02)70560-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(02)70560-1													WOS:000174587400004

BULLETIN FRANCAIS DE LA PECHE ET DE LA PISCICULTURE												Salmonid introductions have been numerous during the last 60 years in high-elevation streams and lakes of the Hautes-Pyrenees region. Six salmonid species : brown trout (Salmo trutta L.), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss Walbaum), brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis Mitchill), arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus L.), lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush Walbaum), and splake (Salvelinus fontinalis x Salvelinus namaycush) have been introduced in these regions where originally no fish was present. Acclimatization was observed in many cases, but investigations revealed that few populations reproduce. Only lake species (lake trout and arctic chaw) reproduce in most lakes into which they were introduced. Adequate spawning conditions were the most important feature required for salmonid naturalisation. But in streams, interspecific competition with brown trout, the effects of angling, and severe winter conditions also interfered. The ecological effects of these introductions on the native brown trout species were very weak. Consequences were more important for amphibian populations, many of which declined dramatically. Salmonid introductions allowed the development of sport fishing in these high-elevation regions. From this point of view, they perfectly answered their aims. Broad knowledge on the whole Pyrenean mountain range is now required for a global management policy of introductions.																			0767-2861						1997		344-45					205	219		10.1051/kmae:1997023	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/kmae:1997023													WOS:A1997XJ69300020

The dunes are restricted to the former glacial lakebed, thus lying directly in contact with glaciolacustrine sediments, and have so far prompted different opinions regarding their genesis and age. This study aims to answer these open questions regarding the age and origin of these landforms and to provide information on the associated past sedimentary processes. To achieve this, we combine macro-scale (sedimentary structures and ground-penetrating radar survey) and micro-scale (grain-size, shape and character of quartz grain surfaces and mineral composition) studies with optically stimulated luminescence dating. The glaciolacustrine fines in the study area are wavy stratified, with the occurrence of mica horizons and prevalence of quartz sand grains with aeolian characteristics. Therefore, these sediments argue for near-standing/low-energy water conditions in the glacial lake, where allochthonous material was delivered by wind. A fall in the lake level and the occurrence of dry land on the northern coast of the regressive Late Weichselian Lake Peipsi favoured aeolian activity from ca. 13.5 to 10.5 ka in the region. The aeolian accumulation was brief-as apparent from the results of the micro-scale study-and lacks evidence of sediment recycling. Only easily-removable mica was deflated at the end of the aeolian depositional phase.

Hyperspectral reflectance data from the PRISMA, DESIS and EnMAP missions (2019-2022, summer periods) were compared with in situ measurements from WISPStation and used as inputs for water quality product generation algorithms. The bio-optical model BOMBER was run to simultaneously retrieve water quality parameters (Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and Total Suspended Matter, (TSM)) and the coverage of submerged and emergent macrophytes (SM, EM); value-added products, such as Phycocyanin concentration maps, were generated through a machine learning approach. The results showed radiometric agreement between satellite and in situ data, with R-2 > 0.9, a Spectral Angle < 10 degrees and water quality mapping errors < 30%. Both SM and EM coverage varied significantly from 2019 (135 ha, 0 ha, respectively) to 2022 (2672 ha, 343 ha), likely influenced by changes in rainfall and lake levels. The areas of greatest variability in Chl-a and TSM were identified in the littoral zones in the western side of the lake, while the highest variation in the fractional cover of SM and density of EM were observed in the south-eastern region; this information could support the water authorities' monitoring activities. To this end, further developments to improve the reference field data for the validation of water quality products are recommended.

Baikal glacier system, new findings	LED I SNEG-ICE AND SNOW												Three glaciers and other small glacial formations, which are not mentioned in the USSR Catalog of glaciers as well as in any published article, were found in the area of the Verkhneangarsky (upper Angara) Range on satellite images. Earlier, researchers from the Institute of Geography of Siberian Branch of RAS described a group of glaciers on the Baikal Mountains and the Barguzin Range, which together with the above group of the Verkhneangarsky Range are related to the Baikal basin by the climate conditions. Ogdynda-Maskit Glacier has been described on the spot in 2017, while other glaciers and snow patches are to be investigated in situ in 2018. Together with the above Baikal and Barguzin glaciers, new data allow identification of the Baikal Glacial system. The article presents analysis of climate changes in the region. Trends in mean annual temperature range from 1 to 4 degrees C/50 years, while the same of summer temperatures change from 1 to 3 degrees C/50 years, but without any evident spatial distribution between them. Another situation takes place in the spatial distribution of precipitation: trends in total precipitation decrease towards the Baikal Lake, while precipitation of the cold period, on the contrary, slightly increases towards the Lake, but with rather small trend - 10-40 mm per 50 years. The last fact confirms the influence of the Baikal basin on the alimentation of glaciers and snow patches on the Verkhneangarsky Range. Currently, glaciers of the Verkhneangarsky Range undergo a slow regression.

Individual variability of diel vertical migrations in European vendace (Coregonus albula) explored by stationary vertical hydroacoustics	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH					Conference on Behaviour and Ecology of Freshwater Fish - Linking Ecology and Individual Behaviour	AUG 22-26, 2004	Silkeborg, DENMARK	Danish Inst Fisheries Res, Dept Inland Fisheries & Ecol Freshwater Fish				Diel vertical migration (DVM) is a widespread behavioural pattern in populations of aquatic animals. Its adaptive value is explained by a trade-off between the protection against visually feeding predators in the dark hypolimnion during daytime, and a higher food uptake in the upper food-rich layers during the night. Whereas vertical migration patterns of entire populations have been frequently described, less is known with respect to individual variability of DVM within fish populations. Here, individual migration patterns of European vendace (Coregonus albula) are described, obtained by stationary vertical hydroacoustics in Lake Stechlin (Germany) during the dusk and dawn phases of 2 months in 2004. The variability of speeds of depth change was high, with only a few fish rising or falling faster than 1 cm s(-1). Swimming activity was not dependent on fish size. There was some evidence that variability of echo strengths was highest in those fish which showed the greatest three-dimensional swimming distances which might indicate a limited swimbladder compensation during vertical migrations. However, migration seems to be performed mainly in a saltatory mode with vertical swimming always interrupted by phases of constant depth. It is suggested that these phases are used for pressure compensation by fish with the consequence that overall the frequency distribution of target strengths deviates only slightly between the start and the end of the recordings. Stationary hydroacoustics proved to be a useful tool for studying individual fish swimming behaviour.

Models I-or the relative shore level L changes in the two basin areas are proposed. Both in the Mecklenburg Bay basin and in the Arkona Basin maximum shore levels of c. 20 in below present sea level were reached in late Allerod, in late Younger Dryas and in late Preboreal. The drainage of the Baltic Ice Lake led to shore level drops, but in Mecklenburg Bay the drop only amounted to around 5 m, because the Darss threshold hindered further regression. In the Arkona Basin, the drop after the final drainage of the Baltic Ice Lake was approximately 20 m, whereas the water level falls after the Allerod drainage of the Baltic Ice Lake and after the Ancylus Lake maximum, have not yet been determined. The Darss Sill area became a land area with local lakes after the Ancylus Lake drainage; there is no evidence of erosion or fluvial/deltaic sediments in Mecklenburg Bay that could be referred to the proposed so-called Dana River. The evolution of the shore level after the Boreal lowstand is poorly confined by our data, but hydrographic conditions similar to the present were established at c. 7.6 cal. ka BP.

J	Gao, T; Xie, L				Gao, Tao; Xie, Lian			Spatiotemporal changes in precipitation extremes over Yangtze River basin, China, considering the rainfall shift in the late 1970s	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												Precipitation extremes are the dominated causes for the formation of severe flood disasters at regional and local scales under the background of global climate change. In the present study, five annual extreme precipitation events, including 1, 7 and 30 day annual maximum rainfall and 95th and 97.5th percentile threshold levels, are analyzed relating to the reference period 1960-2011 from 140 meteorological stations over Yangtze River basin (YRB). A generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution is applied to fit annual and percentile extreme precipitation events at each station with return periods up to 200 years. The entire time period is divided into preclimatic (preceding climatic) period 1960-1980 and aftclimatic (after climatic) period 1981-2011 by considering distinctly abrupt shift of precipitation regime in the late 1970s across YRB. And the Mann-Kendall trend test is adopted to conduct trend analysis during pre- and aftclimatic periods, respectively, for the purpose of exploring possible increasing/decreasing patterns in precipitation extremes. The results indicate that the increasing trends for retum values during aftclimatic period change significantly in time and space in terms of different magnitudes of extreme precipitation, while the stations with significantly positive trends are mainly distributed in the vicinity of the mainstream and major tributaries as well as large lakes, this would result in more tremendous flood disasters in the mid-lower reaches of YRB, especially in southeast coastal regions. The increasing/decreasing linear trends based on annual maximum precipitation are also investigated in pre- and aftclimatic periods, respectively, whereas those changes are not significantly similar to the variations of return values during both subperiods. Moreover, spatiotemporal patterns of precipitation extremes become more uneven and unstable in the second half period over YRB. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

An integrated decision support system for Sydney Catchment Authority's water supply planning and operations	19TH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION (MODSIM2011)					MSSANZ 19th Biennial Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM)	DEC 12-16, 2011	Perth, AUSTRALIA	CSIRO, Australian Govt, Bur Meteorol, Per Convent & Exhibit Ctr, Perth Convent Bur, Curtin Univ, Australian Math Soc, Australian & New Zealand Ind & Appl Math, Australian Math Sci Inst, Maralte Publishers, Econ Soc Australian, HEMA Consulting, Simulat Australia, Stat Soc Australia Inc, Modelling & Simulat Soc Australia & New Zealand Inc, Int Assoc Math & Comp Simulat				Australia's surface drinking water resources are commonly comprised of multiple interconnecting dams with numerous users and various water quality priorities. Managing such systems is challenging and requires innovative methods to make use of complex database systems and therefore enable optimal decision-making. Decision support systems are designed to assist decision makers, managers and operators access relevant information and make informed short and long term operational and strategic decisions through the use of data, tools and knowledge. The Sydney Catchment Authority (SCA) is responsible for the provision of water to Sydney Water Corporation for treatment and distribution of drinking water to more than four million people in Sydney, the Blue Mountains and the Illawarra, and supply to Southern Highlands, Goulburn, and Shoalhaven communities. The water supply storages comprise 2600 GL across 10 major (plus 6 minor) water storage dams. Of these, Lake Burragorang, the Shoalhaven Scheme and Prospect Reservoir account for 81% of the SCA water storage capacity. These systems have multiple water users and varying water quality issues. A key concern in Warragamba Dam is flood inflow dynamics and the load of catchment contaminants that can lead to outlet water quality problems, including blue-green algae. The Shoalhaven Scheme, comprised of Lake Yarrunga, Fitzroy Falls Reservoir and Wingecarribee Reservoir, is managed with respect to hydroelectric power transfers, recreational use and downstream impacts. To manage the multiple dimensions of the storage network, a customised innovative tool is used for water supply planning and operations. The Sydney Catchment Authority Reservoir Management System (SCARMS) integrates observational data and validated catchment, hydrodynamic and water quality models into a decision support system. Five major SCA storages (Warragamba Dam, Tallowa Dam, Fitzroy Falls Dam, Wingecarribee Dam and Prospect Dam) are currently integrated into SCARMS. SCARMS integrates an extensive supply of both real-time and historical data sources for the five storages. Real-time data sources include stream flow rates and properties, in-lake meteorology and in-lake water column temperature and water quality. Historical data sources include routine physical, chemical and biological monitoring data collected by SCA over the past 40 years. All relevant data are integrated into SCARMS and are processed, quality assessed and visualised. The data are used to drive and validate coupled three-dimensional hydrodynamics and water quality models (The Estuary, Lake and Coastal Ocean Model, ELCOM, and the Computational Aquatic Ecosystems Dynamics Model, CAEDYM). The integration of field data and numerical models allows a combination of real-time, forecast and hindcast simulations of reservoir conditions to be conducted on an ongoing basis. Collation of the field data and model scenario output in a user-friendly interface provides decision support for daily operations and long-term strategic planning. Customised reports can be generated to communicate knowledge to the range of operators, managers and selected stakeholders. This data, model and knowledge package is housed at SCA and demonstrates successful innovations in collating a range of necessary tools into a seamlessly linked and customised decision support system for the management of large-scale water resource systems.																					978-0-9872143-1-7				2011							4043	4049																WOS:000314989304002

Relatively high levels of variation ( numbers of alleles and heterozygosity) were observed in all collections and allele frequencies were quite variable among collections. Evidence of limited introgression by rainbow and/or Yellowstone cutthroat was found at several locations. Both F-ST values and tests of genetic differentiation indicated the existence of numerous, reproductively isolated populations. The population in Slate Creek was very similar to the Kings Lake Hatchery strain, and we conclude that this similarity is the result of historical introductions of this hatchery strain into what was presumably a stream without a native cutthroat population. In one stream, differences in introgression and allele frequencies were found above and below a barrier falls. Because of the substantial level of population differentiation observed among the various collections, we recommend that management and conservation actions be focused at the level of individual streams in order to maintain the productivity and genetic character of the existing populations of cutthroat trout.																			0378-1909	1573-5133				MAR	2004	69	1-4					127	142		10.1023/B:EBFI.0000022886.47243.bf	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:EBFI.0000022886.47243.bf													WOS:000220671700010
J	Potter, L; Xu, YJ; Simak, J				Potter, Lee; Xu, Yijun; Simak, Jonathan			Significance of Standardizing Carbon Dioxide Measurement Time Within Lake Systems to Constrain CO2 Outgassing Estimation Uncertainties	WATER												Recent studies have emphasized the diel nature of dissolved CO2 (pCO(2)) in lake systems; however, around the world, field measurements have been conducted at different times, and it is not clear how, and to what extent, this variable sampling time affects CO2 emission (FCO2). This research aimed to investigate whether 10:00 am. was an effective time for lake field sampling to capture 24 h mean pCO(2) and FCO2 from subtropical eutrophic shallow lake systems. To accomplish this goal, our study compiled long-term data from three individual studies on a shallow lake system in southeast Louisiana, USA. The data comprised samples collected across three-hour intervals, seasonally, over five years. This study highlights that a lake system can function as a carbon sink during peak daylight hours and can shift to a source overnight to early morning. The findings from the longer-term data confirmed 9:00 am to 11:00 am as the time range when pCO(2) deviation from the daily mean is at its lowest (111% of the daily mean). Sampling outside of this time range resulted in an increase in FCO2 (32.09 mmol m(-2) h(-1)) of up to 271% (87.03 mmol m(-2) h(-1)) in overnight samples, with daytime measurements of FCO2 flipping the lake from source to sink sequestering -20.17 mmol m(-2) h(-1). Based on our findings, we strongly recommend that future studies in similar aquatic systems utilize the 9:00-11:00 am timeframe for field sampling to increase the accuracy and compatibility of shared data in carbon emission estimation.

G.; Vonhof, Hubert; Pedley, Martyn			A depositional model for spherulitic carbonates associated with alkaline, volcanic lakes	MARINE AND PETROLEUM GEOLOGY												The South Atlantic Aptian 'Pre-salt' reservoirs are formed by a combination of spherulitic carbonates and Mg-rich clays accumulated in volcanic alkaline lake settings with exotic chemistries. So far, outcrop analogues characterised by metre-thick successions deposited in lacustrine scenarios are elusive so disentangling the genesis of spherulitic carbonates represents a major scientific challenge with business impact. In particular the controls on spatial distribution and the environment of spherulitic facies formation remain poorly constrained, little studied, and hotly debated. To shed light on this conundrum, a spherulitic carbonate-rich, alkaline volcanic lacustrine succession has been analysed at outcrop scale: the Carboniferous East Kirkton Limestone (Scotland). Despite clays being very scarce and limited to layers of amorphous Mg-Si minerals, a diverse array of spherulitic calcitic components were formed, including coated grains, crusts, and build-ups. This setting enables the mechanisms of spherulitic calcite development and the patterns of sediment accumulation to be explored in a geobiological and hydrochemical scenario similar to the 'Pre-Salt' subsurface occurrences but divorced from clay influence. The integration of logs, borehole data, outcrop photomosaics and petrographic observations collectively allowed the reconstruction of a depositional model for the East Kirkton lacustrine succession. In this model, calcite spherule nucleation took place at the sediment-water interface in the littoral zone, driven by the co-occurrence of 1) high alkalinity, 2) Ca-Mg rich hydrochemistry, and 3) microbial-derived colloidal exopolymeric substances. These environmental conditions permitted the coeval development of spherulitic cementstone build-ups and spherulitic grainstone-packstone within the wave-agitated zone, and the accumulation of floatstones and laminites of spherulitic grains in deeper lake regions by means of downslope reworking. This model is consistent with the previously documented microbial bloom oc-currences and highlights the need to better understand the complex 'microbe-solution' interactions before any reliable fades model is envisaged.

Trends in body condition of native piscivores following invasion of Lakes Erie and Ontario by the round goby	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Biological invaders can provide a highly abundant novel prey, yet the effect this has on the body condition of native predators is unknown. Since invading the Laurentian Great Lakes over two decades ago, the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) has become an important food source for many native species. We used long-term data from Lakes Erie and Ontario (1993-2012) to create quantile regression models of mass-length relationships for populations of four native predators: smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu), yellow perch (Perca flavescens), walleye (Sander vitreus) and burbot (Lota lota). Model-based estimates of changes in mass-at-length following the invasion were used to compare the effects of round goby on relative trends in body condition. Water temperature data were also included in the models, to investigate its effects on body condition. The condition of smallmouth bass increased after the invasion, varying in magnitude between lakes and among size classes. Condition of yellow perch changed variably in direction and magnitude, depending on the quantile of the mass-length relationship examined and fish length, whereas that of walleye increased only for larger fish in Lake Ontario. Minor increases in mass-at-length were observed for the smallest length class of burbot, while the body condition of burbot in the largest length class decreased during the study period. Mean summer water temperature did not differ between pre- and post-invasion time periods in Lakes Erie and Ontario, although water temperature was a significant predictor of body condition. Changes in body condition may have implications for additional population and life history characteristics. Future research should investigate the effects of the round goby on growth, age at maturity, fecundity and survival of native predators.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				JAN	2015	60	1					111	124		10.1111/fwb.12473	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12473													WOS:000346069800009
J	KEDDY, PA				KEDDY, PA			LAKES AS ISLANDS - DISTRIBUTIONAL ECOLOGY OF 2 AQUATIC PLANTS, LEMNA-MINOR-L AND LEMNA-TRISULCA L	ECOLOGY												Groups of lakes can be considered archipelagos, and island biogeographic theory can be used to explain the distribution of aquatics within them. Two species of duckweed, L. minor and L. trisulca, were studied as examples. Both are found in S Ontario [Canada], but L. minor occurs much more frequently than L. trisulca. It is this difference the experiments were designed to explain. Colonization capability of each species was defined as its ability to: (1) withstand desiccation, (2) quickly populate a new habitat and (3) inhibit the other species competitively. L. minor was clearly far superior to L. trisulca in abilities (1) and (2), and in (3) it was judged superior or equal to L. trisulca. Wherever L. minor and L. trisulca are still colonizing recently deglaciated habitats, superior colonization capability alone can explain the more frequent occurrence of L. minor. S Ontario lakes may already have reached equilibrium, where the rate of species colonization is balanced by the rate of species extinction. Increases in summer pH above 8 occur, and as both species die above this point, pH could be the major cause of mortality. The observed frequencies of occurrence could be the result of a balance between different rates of colonization and approximately equal rates of extinction.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1976	57	2					353	359		10.2307/1934824	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1934824													WOS:A1976BU06400014

Satellite Tracking Data Reveals High-Use Areas for Immature Bald Eagles from Kentucky	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												Immature raptors often travel long distances and move nomadically from the time they leave their natal area to the time they are recruited into the breeding population. Emphasis on identifying the nesting and winter habitat of Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) has overshadowed the need to understand the habitat and spatial use of young eagles prior to reaching maturity. We used satellite telemetry to track the movements of immature Bald Eagles hatched in western Kentucky during 2010-2016. We analyzed movement data to identify high-use areas for eagles in their first and second years during warm and cool periods. Five out of seven eagles migrated north to the Great Lakes region during their first year. Using Brownian Bridge Movement Modelling, we identified 47 noncontiguous high-use areas during the warm period and 67 during the cool period. Public lands comprised 17% of warm period high-use areas and 43% of cool period high-use areas. High-use areas were located in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Arkansas and Tennessee, and were often near federally-owned dams, rivers with sandbars, or areas with abundant waterfowl. Our small sample of tracked eagles correctly identified known Bald Eagle concentration areas within the study area; thus, we infer that previously unrecognized high-use areas identified by this study are likely to be concentration areas important to the larger population.

Using data from a Norwegian mountain hydropower reservoir, Aursjoen, we illustrate how reduced availability of L. arcticusas prey resulted in the reduced condition, growth and delayed maturation of resident brown trout (Salmo trutta). We further link changes in the relative abundance of L. arcticusas prey to changing reservoir conditions, e.g. water level changes in the spring period, thereby establishing an indirect link between reservoir operation regimes and brown trout population traits. While no evidence for decreased brown trout survival was found, the results indicate that alternative brown trout prey resources, i.e. the small chydorid cladoceran Eurycercus lamellatus, do not appear to have successfully offset the caloric loss from reduced consumption of large-sized L. arcticus. Although the fundamental explanation for the observedL. arcticuscollapse remains largely unknown, the present findings provide strong evidence that this vulnerable crustacean species can affect the abundance, viability and life history traits of valued resident salmonid populations in oligotrophic alpine lakes and reservoirs exposed to climate- and hydropower-driven changes in water levels and temperature.					; Eloranta, Antti/IUM-9302-2023; Lakka, Hanna-Kaisa/JDW-0276-2023	Lakka, Hanna-Kaisa/0000-0001-9017-3199; Eloranta, Antti/0000-0002-8893-0135; 													1015-1621	1420-9055				SEP 4	2020	82	4							78	10.1007/s00027-020-00751-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-020-00751-x													WOS:000565877800001

Approximately 4000 RADARSAT-1 images are received annually for ice reconnaissance work, but the appearance of dramatic atmospheric conditions imprinted on the open water of oceans and lakes has increased interest in using this data for other marine and meteorological applications. To exploit the CIS operational RADARSAT-1 data stream, a demonstration project was initiated for the winter of 2001 to deliver RADARSAT-1 ScanSAR images and derived wind products to meteorological centres in the East Coast and Great Lakes regions of Canada. Meteorologists were trained in interpreting synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery and how wind products are generated from SAR data. From January to April 2001, over 600 images and wind products were delivered in near real time to weather centres for use in forecast production. Feedback from meteorologists in the use of RADARSAT-1 for weather applications was positive, especially for site-specific weather forecasting in regions such as coastal or marginal ice zones, lakes, and estuaries in which scatterometer land contamination is an issue and data from other sources are sparse. Additionally, initial validations of the ocean monitoring workstation (OMW) wind products have shown promising results.

J	Verschuren, D				Verschuren, D			Reconstructing fluctuations of a shallow East African lake during the past 1800 yrs from sediment stratigraphy in a submerged crater basin	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												The sedimentology of an 8.22-m long core of late-Holocene deposits in the submerged Crescent Island Crater basin of Lake Naivasha, Kenya, is used to reconstruct decade-scale fluctuations in lake-surface elevation during the past 1800 yrs. Lake-depth inference for the past 1000 yrs is semi-quantitative, based on (1) relationships between lake level and bottom dynamics predicted by wave theory, and (2) historical validation of the effects of lake-level fluctuation and hydrologic closure on sediment composition in Crescent Island Crater and nearby Lake Oloidien. In these shallow fluctuating lakes, organic-carbon variation in a lithological sequence from clayey mud to algal gyttja is positively correlated with lake depth at the time of deposition, because the focusing of oxidized littoral sediments which dilute autochthonous organic matter before burial is reduced during highstands. The lake-level reconstruction for Lake Naivasha agrees with other adequately dated lake-level records from equatorial East Africa in its implication of dry climatic conditions during the Mediaeval Warm Period and generally wet conditions during the Little Ice Age. Crescent Island Crater survived widespread aridity in the early-19th century as a fresh weedy pond, while the main basin of Lake Naivasha and many other shallow East African lakes fell dry and truncated their sediment archive of Little Ice Age climatic variability.																			0921-2728					APR	2001	25	3					297	311		10.1023/A:1011150300252	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1011150300252													WOS:000167852600003

Lack of mtDNA and morphological differentiation between two acorn barnacles Tetraclita japonica and T-formosana differing in parietes colours and geographical distribution	MARINE BIOLOGY												Tetraclita japonica and T. formosana are common intertidal barnacles with similar morphology, which leads to uncertainty in their species status. In the present study, we try to elucidate the taxonomic status of the two taxa using morphology and mitochondrial control region and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) sequences of the barnacles in their distribution range. The two taxa were found to be morphologically similar; a diagnostic difference between them was only observed in the colour of the parietes and opercular plates. Little genetic differentiation was detected in the control region and COI (Phi(CT) < 0.025 for both markers) between two taxa, but differentiation was found between the southern (Taiwan and Hong Kong) and northern (Japan) populations of T. japonica/T. formosana, which might be the result of isolation by distance and upwelling in summer. Our data suggest that the two presently recognized species probably represent two colour morphotypes of the same species exhibiting different geographical distribution. T. japonica is abundant in Japan and southeast coast of China, whereas T. formosana is only abundant in Taiwan. The heterogeneous environment might exert a divergent selection pressure leading to asymmetric distribution of the two colour morphotypes. The different colours might be a result of either phenotypic plasticity adaptive to environmental variables or genetic hitchhiking of local adaptive genotypes.

However, reefs are often designed without consideration for testing design features and constructed without clear objectives or a long-term assessment plan to evaluate changes in reef characteristics. To mitigate for degradation of lake trout spawning habitat in Thunder Bay, Lake Huron, we constructed 29 cobble reefs in 2010-11. Reef design incorporated height, orientation, and size as replicated factors. In addition to assessment of reef use by lake trout, we evaluated the biotic and abiotic changes in the reefs over five years post-construction and compared them to two adjacent degraded reefs and a seminatural reef. Each reef was mapped annually by side-scan sonar to examine changes in the physical structure, such as slumping. Divers surveyed a subset of the reefs each year, and sampled substrate to quantify benthic macroinvertebrates, including zebra mussels. Algal colonization and round gobies were evaluated qualitatively. Temperature, dissolved oxygen, and sediment accumulation were measured over the winter at the vertical center and base of two reefs each year. Little physical change or sedimentation occurred. Qualitative abundance of coregonine eggs, presence of other fishes, and colonization by algae and macroinvertebrates increased throughout the monitoring period, indicating that the reefs have long-term value for a diversity of species. & COPY; 2022 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

Quantifying the influence of surface water-groundwater interaction on nutrient flux in a lowland karst catchment	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Nutrient contamination of surface waters and groundwaters is an issue of growing importance as the risks associated with agricultural run-off escalate due to increasing demands on global food production. In this study, the influence of surface water-groundwater interaction on the nutrient flux in a lowland karst catchment was investigated with the aid of alkalinity sampling and a hydrological model. The objective of the study was to determine the impact of ephemeral karst lakes (turloughs) on the surface water-groundwater nutrient flux, and whether these lakes act as sources or sinks of nutrients within the groundwater flow system. Water samples were tested from a variety of rivers, turloughs, boreholes and springs at monthly intervals over 3 years. Alkalinity sampling was used to elucidate the contrasting hydrological functioning between different turloughs. Such disparate hydrological functioning was further investigated with the aid of a hydrological model which allowed for an estimate of allogenically and autogenically derived nutrient loading into the karst system. The model also allowed for an investigation of mixing within the turloughs, comparing observed behaviours with the hypothetical conservative behaviour allowed for by the model. Within the turloughs, recorded nutrient concentrations were found to reduce over the flooded period, even though the turloughs hydrological functioning (and the hydrological model) suggested this would not occur under conservative conditions. As such, it was determined that nutrient loss processes were occurring within the system. Denitrification during stable flooded periods (typically 3-4 months per year) was deemed to be the main process reducing nitrogen concentrations within the turloughs, whereas phosphorus loss is thought to occur mostly via sedimentation and subsequent soil deposition. The results from this study suggest that, in stable conditions, ephemeral lakes can impart considerable nutrient losses on a karst groundwater system.					; Gill, Laurence/D-2592-2014	McCormack, Ted/0000-0003-4213-7075; Gill, Laurence/0000-0002-1599-1105; Naughton, Owen/0000-0001-9616-0022													1027-5606	1607-7938					2016	20	5					2119	2133		10.5194/hess-20-2119-2016	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-2119-2016													WOS:000377862900028

The model represents a moving vertical column of air with vertical resolution of 25 m near the ground. Calculations have been performed for a series of trajectories, with representation of emissions, vertical mixing, and photochemistry for a 3-day period ending with the arrival of the air column at Pellston. Results have been used to identify causes of the observed decrease in isoprene at night, to investigate causes of high nighttime OH. Significant OH can be generated at night by terpenes if it is assumed that some fast-reacting monoterpenes are emitted at rates comparable to inventory emissions for terpenes. However, this nighttime OH is confined to a shallow surface layer (0-25 m) and has little impact on nighttime chemistry. The observed decrease in isoprene at night can be reproduced in models with low OH, and is attributed primarily to vertical dilution. There is also evidence that transport from Lake Michigan contributes to low nighttime isoprene at Pellston. Model results compare well with measured isoprene, NOx, and with isoprene vertical profiles. Significant model-measurement discrepancies are found for OH, HO2, methylvinylketone, and formaldehyde.

J	Puttock, GD; Shakotko, P; Rasaputra, JG				Puttock, GD; Shakotko, P; Rasaputra, JG			An empirical habitat model for moose, Alces alces, in Algonquin Park, Ontario	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												An empirical habitat model has been estimated for moose, Alces alces, in Algonquin Provincial Park in the southern Great Lakes-St. Lawrence forest region of Ontario using annual moose population data and habitat characteristics which have been extracted from the forest resource inventory for the park. Linear and logarithmic specifications of the model were estimated within the family of functional forms allowed by the Box-Cox specification. The linear specification provided a satisfactory relationship between habitat characteristics and moose density. Habitat characteristics explained 73% of the variance in moose density in the park. Moose are attracted to stands which are 1-20 years old and to stands with less than 30% stocking, and also to conifer stands older than 20 years with less than 50% canopy closure while avoiding the more open areas which would offer little thermal protection or relief from deep snow. The moose population surveys were conducted during the months of January and February, and the model may be detecting mid-winter habitat selection by moose in home ranges which are sufficiently large as to satisfy year-round cover and forage requirements. The estimated model was tested by comparing predicted and observed moose density using habitat and moose population data from another time period. The model provided reasonable 10-year forecasts of moose population-habitat relationships for Algonquin Park.																			0378-1127					FEB	1996	81	1-3					169	178		10.1016/0378-1127(95)03644-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0378-1127(95)03644-X													WOS:A1996UF88500016

However, the often-overlooked interconnection between geodiversity components limits our comprehension of geosystems. In the Chinchina River Basin (CRB) in Colombia, located in the northern Andes in South America, we established criteria to differentiate geodiversity classes, calculated indices to understand the distribution of geological elements, and discussed systemic relationships. This comprehensive approach lays the foundation for a holistic comprehension of the territory's structure and functionality. Our findings revealed the convergence in an area of 1052 km2 of 10 rock types, 7 slope ranges, 13 landforms, 5 drainage density features, 610.4 km of faults with 9 kinematic tendencies, 5 soil orders, 5 climate types, a 3328 km surface drainage network with 7 hydrographic orders, 1 underground aquifer, 4 areas with lakes, 2 zones with glaciers, 27 polygenetic and monogenetic volcanoes, and several thermal springs. This discussion explores the implications of various methodologies used to establish the value of the general geodiversity index while also examining the relationships between abiotic elements and their distribution patterns. This forms a fundamental basis for understanding the geosystem services of the basin in terms of regulation, support, and provisioning processes, as well as the culture and knowledge derived from geodiversity. These conceptual elements are indispensable for enhancing the sustainability of a region that is susceptible to the impacts of climate change. Furthermore, they serve as the foundations for the objective's achievement, as set by the UNESCO Global Geopark project "Volcan del Ruiz", currently ongoing within the region.					; Nemeth, Karoly/V-7614-2017	ARIAS DIAZ, ALEJANDRO/0000-0001-9866-2704; Vallejo-Hincapie, Felipe/0000-0002-0743-0906; Murcia, Hugo/0000-0002-3570-1988; Nemeth, Karoly/0000-0003-1026-0407														2073-445X				NOV	2023	12	11							2053	10.3390/land12112053	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land12112053													WOS:001113647000001

The Effect of Municipal Wastewater Effluent on Nitrogen Levels in Onondaga Lake, a 36-Year Record	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												This work presents a retrospective analysis of long-term trends in loading of forms of nitrogen (N) from the Metropolitan Syracuse Wastewater Treatment Plant (Metro), N concentrations in the receiving urban lake (Onondaga Lake, New York), and related water quality status for the period from 1972 to 2007. The history of the evolution of treatment and discharge at Metro, as it affected N loading, is reviewed and forms the basis for identification of five regimes during which unifying conditions of loading and in-lake conditions prevailed. Changes in industrial waste inputs have complicated the effects of upgrades in treatment at Metro from primary (until 1978) to advanced (starting in 2004). Current N loading from Metro is approximately 35% lower than the peak levels observed in the late 1980s to late 1990s, but the areal rate to the lake remains extremely high (approximately 97 g/m(2).y), representing approximately 75% of the overall N load. Implementation of year-round nitrification treatment has resulted in transformation of the composition of the N load from Metro from ammonia (T-NH3) to nitrate (NO3-) dominance. High N concentrations have prevailed in the upper waters of the lake throughout the study period with averages of total N ranging from 2.6 to 4.3 mg/L for the five regimes. Total N levels and partitioning among the forms in the lake generally have tracked Metro loading conditions for the five regimes. The effects of Metro loading on seasonal in-lake patterns are demonstrated to be modified by both hydrologic inputs from tributaries and in-lake operation of biochemical processes. Resolution of these effects is supported by application of both empirical and dynamic mass balance models. Water quality problems related to high concentrations of forms of N are documented, including (1) augmentation of dissolved oxygen depletion during fall mixing from in-lake nitrification events, enabled by high T-NH3 levels; (2) violations of ammonia toxicity limits; and (3) violations of nitrite toxicity standards. These problems were either greatly ameliorated or eliminated by Metro's most recent treatment upgrades. Prevailing conditions are considered in a management context, including (1) likelihood of exceedances of toxicity limits in the future and (2) potential role of elevated nitrate levels in preventing mobilization of methyl mercury from the lake's sediments.

The transparent polyethylene enclosures included the whole water column and varied in volume from 30 to 40 m(3). There were two types of enclosures: some with natural sediment as a bottom and others with a plastic bottom. The experiment was a 2 x 2 factorial design with presence of sediment and nutrient enrichment as treatment factors. Both the sediment presence and nutrient enrichment significantly increased water nutrient concentrations and the rate of primary production. However, external nutrient enrichment and the presence of sediment stimulated the growth of different phytoplankton groups, indicating that the effect of sediment was not related to nutrient fluxes alone, but involved more complex interactions. External nutrient enrichment was primarily channelled to picoplanktonic cyanobacteria, the biomass of which increased four- to fivefold due to enrichment. The presence of sediment increased the biomass of cryptophytes, chrysophytes and prasinophytes, but decreased the biomass of N-2-fixing cyanobacteria. Zooplankton biomass increased during the experiment, but was not affected by the treatments. The study shows that sediment plays a significant role in phytoplankton dynamics, underlining the importance of including sediment in shallow-water mesocosm experiments.

A Diagnostic Examination of the Eastern Ontario and Western Quebec Wintertime Convection Event of 28 January 2010	WEATHER AND FORECASTING												The priority of an operational forecast center is to issue watches, warnings, and advisories to notify the public about the inherent risks and dangers of a particular event. Occasionally, events occur that do not meet advisory or warning criteria, but still have a substantial impact on human life and property. Short-lived snow bursts are a prime example of such a phenomenon. While these events are typically characterized by small snow accumulations, they often cause very low visibilities and rapidly deteriorating road conditions, both of which are a major hazard to motorists. On the afternoon of 28 January 2010, two such snow bursts moved through the Ottawa River valley and lower St. Lawrence River valley, and created havoc on area roads, resulting in collisions and injuries. Using the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR), these snow bursts were found to be associated with an approaching strong upper-tropospheric trough and the passage of an arctic front. While convection or squall lines are not common in January in Canada, snow bursts are shown to be associated with strong quasigeostrophic forcing for ascent and low-level frontogenesis, in the presence of both convective and conditional symmetric instability. Finally, this paper highlights the need for the development of a standard subadvisory criterion warning of short-lived but high-impact winter weather events, which operational forecasters can issue and quickly disseminate to the general public.

J	JONASSON, PM				JONASSON, PM			RIVER LAXA ECOSYSTEM, ICELAND	OIKOS												The drainage area of the River Laxa is 2150 km2 and its length, 58 km. The source is Lake Myvatn (38.2 km2). The flow from Lake Myvatn is 32-33 m3 s-1. The spring-fed River Kraka, which is another headwater of the River Laxa, with a length of 35 km, adds another mean flow of 7 m3 s-1. The total flow amounts to 40 m3 s-1, and the catchment basin is assumed to be 1400 km2. Between Lake Myvatn and the power plant is a 33 km long valley, and the water flow covers this distance in 6-7.5 h and the subsequent 25 km lava field section in 10 h. At Birningsstadir, just above the power plant, the average discharge is 43.5 m3 s-1 and with flow extremes from 5 to 164 m3 s-1. Chironomids (54%) and oligochaetes (11%) were the dominating macroinvertebrates of the rivers Laxa and Kraka. Animal life in the upper River Laxa is highly influenced by downstream movement animals and seston from Lake Myvatn, amounting to about 600 kg dry weight h-1. At the lake outflow, besides chironomids and oligochaetes, large numbers of Hydra and filtrating Simulium and Plumatella occur. Seston transport is reduced downstream. Abundance of drift feeding salmon and trout parr is high (0.1-1.1 individuals m-2).																			0030-1299	1600-0706					1979	32	1-2					306	309		10.2307/3544235	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3544235													WOS:A1979HJ61200019

This may potentially impacts plateau lakes such as Lake Erhai in Yunnan province, China. However, the atmospheric N deposition in Lake Erhai basin has not been thoroughly measured, hindering our ability to understand the scale, spatial distribution, and temporal patterns, and potential impact of these inputs on water quality of Lake Erhai. Continuous measurements of wet and dry N deposition were conducted at nine locations within the Lake Erhai basin from 2022 to 2023. Dry deposition fluxes were estimated based on the atmospheric concentrations of inorganic N compounds (including gaseous NO2, HNO3, NH3, and particulate NO3-, NH4+) as well as water-soluble organic N. Wet deposition fluxes were calculated from precipitation measurements, including total N, total dissolved N, and dissolved inorganic N. The findings revealed that the total (dry + wet) annual N deposition across all sites averaged 10.67 +/- 1.93 kg N ha-1 yr-1, with 59% of this coming from dry deposition. NH3 in dry deposition was the largest contributor, accounting for 77% of the dry deposition. In terms of wet deposition, the fluxes decreased in the following order: dissolved inorganic N (3.37 kg N ha-1 yr-1), dissolved organic N (0.68 kg N ha-1 yr-1), and particulate N (0.35 kg N ha-1 yr-1). Seasonally, 36% of the annual dry deposition and 56% of the annual wet deposition occurred during the summer months. The direct atmospheric N input into the lake was calculated to be 218 tons during the study period. Our findings provide new insights into atmospheric N deposition to Lake Erhai and confirm that atmospheric N deposition is a major source of N loading to Lake Erhai.

J	MOSER, KA; MACDONALD, GM				MOSER, KA; MACDONALD, GM			HOLOCENE VEGETATION CHANGE AT TREELINE NORTH OF YELLOWKNIFE, NORTHWEST-TERRITORIES, CANADA	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Two radiocarbon-dated cores from small lakes located approximately 25 km north of the mapped boundary between forest-tundra and tundra provide records of postglacial vegetation change at the treeline near Yellowknife, NWT, Canada. Basal radiocarbon dates of 6180 and 7470 yr B.P. were obtained from the cores. The fossil pollen evidence suggests that the initial vegetation was Betula tundra with a peatland component. Alnus became an important constituent of the pollen assemblages between 6900 and 5500 yr B.P. Both lakes record sharp increases in Picea cf. mariana pollen at approximately 5000 yr B.P., suggesting the establishment of forest-tundra. By 3500 yr B.P. Picea mariana forest-tundra had withdrawn. The proportion of organic to inorganic sediment in the cores was at a maximum between 5000 and 3500 yr B.P. Tundra has dominated the region since 3500 yr B.P. In northwestern Canada, the maximum northward advance of treeline occurred between 9000 and 5000 yr B.P. The asynchrony in treeline advance in central and northwestern Canada may reflect that glacial ice persisted in the interior NWT longer than previously believed. Alternatively, the asynchronous history of the treeline may be a result of the geometric properties of the long-wave westerly disturbance that is manifest in the median summer position of the arctic front and ultimately controls the geographic location of the treeline.

In addition to human development, climate change is also an important factor that threatens the health of Iran's wetlands. Very few studies have examined the major threats to Iran's international wetlands, and it is not clear to what extent these wetlands are affected by anthropogenic and climatic pressures. Therefore, determining how vulnerable these ecosystems are to human development and climate change can help us better manage and restore them. In this regard, this study is aimed at measuring the changes in water bodies of 24 international wetlands when comparing late summer 2000 and 2020 using Landsat images. Next, we calculate the upstream dams' water bodies and discover the long-term trend of precipitation and temperature changes around the wetlands. Our results show that nine wetlands, most of which were marine and estuarine, increased in area between 2000 and 2020. However, eleven wetlands experienced a 1.0-53.5% decrease in their water area by 2020. Our findings suggest that climate change can be a significant factor affecting some of the wetlands studied. Conversely, certain wetlands have experienced a rising trend in precipitation between 2000 and 2020, making it challenging to link the decline in their water levels to climate change. Nevertheless, for seven of the wetlands, we observe an increase in the water areas of upstream dams between 2000 and 2020 and find no strong evidence for climate change effects. Therefore, the construction of dams upstream may be the primary reason for the drying of these wetlands, and in this case, more of a threat than climate change.					; rahimi, ehsan/AEB-5036-2022; Ahmadzadeh, Faraham/AFD-9214-2022	Ahmadzadeh, Faraham/0000-0001-7152-8484; Dong, Pinliang/0000-0003-1828-8308; Rahimi, Ehsan/0000-0002-8401-472X; 													2190-6483	2190-6491				DEC	2023	13	4					557	574		10.1007/s13412-023-00846-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13412-023-00846-5		JUL 2023											WOS:001032053800001

Moreover, the distribution of heavy precipitation in the Yangtze River basin, which covers a large area of South China, is sensitive to changes in monsoon intensity. Thus, the paleo-distribution of heavy precipitation in the Yangtze basin is key in reconstructing the paleo-monsoon intensity. In this study, we established proxies for distinguishing sediments from the northwestern and southeastern parts of the Yangtze River basin, with the goal of using them to reconstruct the paleo-distribution of heavy precipitation in the basin based on changes in the provenance of detrital sediments, as determined using sediment records at the river mouth. The proxies included the electron spin resonance (ESR) signal intensity and the crystallinity index (CI) of quartz in modern riverbed sediments along the mainstream and tributaries of the Yangtze River. The data revealed that the fine-silt fraction of the sediments (which represents suspended particulate matter, SPM) from each major tributary can be distinguished on the basis of ESR signal intensity and CI values. The values for each tributary reflect the age and type of bedrock in the tributary basin and show distinct regional variations according to the distribution of geological blocks within the Yangtze basin. In addition, the analyzed ESR signal intensity and CI values of the fine-silt fraction of riverbed sediments below mainstream-tributary junctions agree well with values calculated according to a simple mixing model of SPM discharged from the tributaries and the mainstream.

We investigated how juvenile sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka, which typically rear in lakes before migrating rapidly to sea, make use of riverine and estuarine habitats in the Chignik Lake system (Alaska, USA) where lacustrine rearing capacity limits sockeye salmon productivity. Their distribution, growth, and genetic stock composition were examined during June to August, 2007 to 2009. Sockeye salmon inhabited the estuary for up to 3 mo each summer, representing 2 distinct age classes: Age-0 fry and parr, and Age 1+ smolts. The fry and parr grew rapidly in the estuary, attaining sizes comparable to the lake-reared smolts. Smolts also grew in the estuary in all years, although they occupied the estuary for a briefer period in years when they entered at a larger size. Using genetic mixture analyses, fry and parr in the estuary were assigned to a population that spawns in Chignik River immediately upstream of the estuary, whereas the smolts were assigned to 2 genetically distinct population groups associated with separate nursery lakes farther up in the basin. Our findings highlight the role of estuaries for juvenile sockeye salmon in systems with limited freshwater rearing capacity and high salmon density. The persistence of such populations depends in part on preserving a continuum of habitat types, especially in the southern range of the species where a shifting climate and human activities are expected to most greatly impact populations.

Lake-based yields for the 1931-2001 period (0.21 +/- 0.03 Mg km(-2) day(-1)) are 10% higher than estimates for the last 3000 years (0.19 +/- 0.05 Mg km(-2) day(-1)). Fluvial (0.24 +/- 0.08 Mg km(-2) day(-1)) and lake-based yields (ca. 0.21 +/- 0.07 Mg km(-2) day(-1)) are comparable over the period of overlap (1999-2001). Persistence in the long-term yield record is dominated by low frequency (century to decadal) periodicity. This periodicity is shown to inflate the standard error of the sediment yield estimate for the basin. Elevated transport of suspended sediments following years of extreme yield is uncommon in the Green Lake record and indicates a sediment-transport regime that is supply limited. For this watershed approximately 50 years of suspended sediment monitoring would be required to reduce the uncertainty of the yield estimate to 37% of its average value. A summer rainstorm in 1991 delivered more suspended sediment to the Green Lake Basin than any other event in the last 3000 years. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Subsurface water piping transports plankton and prevents meromixis in a deep volcanic crater lake (Dominica, West Indies)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Boeri Lake-a small (3.6 ha) but deep (39.6 m) crater lake on Morne Micotrin in Dominica, West Indies-presents a limnological enigma; it exhibits strong morphometric and circumstantial evidence for meromixis, yet it is not stratified. We tested the hypothesis that water seepage from Boeri Lake overcomes morphometric drivers of stratification and prevents the onset of meromixis. We compared water chemistry and plankton community composition in Boeri Lake to perennial streams on Morne Micotrin to assess if water discharging from these springs originates in Boeri Lake. Lacustrine phytoplankton and zooplankton taxa were detected in nearby streams, which also had similar water chemistry to that of Boeri Lake. In contrast, two other streams that drain Morne Micotrin and one neighboring reference stream had little in common with waters from Boeri Lake. This suggests that Boeri Lake's anomalous limnology is explained by hydrologic connectivity to nearby flanking streams, and supports our hypothesis that subsurface water piping, combined with high annual rainfall, stymies the onset of meromixis. We provide an explanation for how holomictic lakes can persist and transport organisms through the ground in tropical mountain ecosystems and discuss implications of consistent water piping for plankton community assembly on island lakes.

Here we report on a radiocarbon-dated Holocene PSV record from a composite 6.7-m-long core collected from the high-sedimentation-rate Huguangyan Maar Lake (HML) in subtropical-tropical South China. Rock magnetic results demonstrate that the natural remanent magnetization resides in single-domain magnetite. Alternating field demagnetization experiments at 1-cm spacing on u-channel samples reveal six distinct inclination highs at 7,500 BCE, 5,100 BCE, 4,600 BCE, 3,600-3,400 BCE, 1,600-1,200 BCE, and 600-800 CE; three inclination lows at 4,800 BCE, 600-300 BCE, and 1,000-1,300 CE; and three eastward declination trends at 3,600-3,200 BCE, 2,600-2,400 BCE, and 400 BCE to 200 CE. The similarity between the HML PSV record and other independently dated records from East Asia and geomagnetic field models corroborates the robustness of our age model and Holocene PSV record. Strikingly, centennial- to millennial-scale PSV features of the HML are comparable, within age uncertainties, with other Holocene records from Europe, North America, and Canada, suggesting that such directional patterns are likely to be hemispheric in scale. Although relative paleointensity data of HML are affected by environmental factors (e.g., organic matter diagenesis), the record still provides a regionally important new PSV reference curve whose conspicuous features may serve as stratigraphic markers for East Asian paleorecords.					; Hou, Lifu/LIC-8244-2024; yang, zhenyu/B-9892-2016; Wang, Xisheng/E-4896-2011	Pei, Junling/0000-0003-4046-3432; Chu, Guoqiang/0000-0001-8256-3947; Dekkers, Mark/0000-0002-4156-3841; Wang, Xisheng/0000-0002-9986-9886; 														1525-2027				JUN	2019	20	6					2681	2697		10.1029/2018GC008106	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018GC008106													WOS:000477582400008

Climate changes that impacted sedimentation include wet dry cycles on variable timescales and an overall progressive trend towards greater aridity. Volcanic influences involved inputs of tephra to the basin, significant inflow of geothermal fluids, and the effects of weathering, erosion and transportation of elastics from trachyte and basalt terrains. Tectonic controls, which were often step-like, reflect the influence of faults that provided pathways for fluids and which controlled accommodation space and drainage directions. Intensified aridity and evaporative concentration resulted in salinity and pH increasing with time, which led to a change from calcite deposition in mildly saline lakes before 380 ka to the later formation of zeolites from reactions of volcaniclastic debris with highly alkaline lake and pore water. After 105 ka, hyperalkaline conditions led to trona accumulation and increasingly variable rare earth elements (REEs). The presence of mixed saline and freshwater diatom taxa between 545 and 16 ka indicates climate variability and episodic inputs of fresh water to saline lakes. Calcrete formed in lake marginal settings during semi-arid periods. Tectonic controls operated independently of climate, but they interacted together to determine environmental conditions. Aquatic deposition was maintained during periods of increasing aridity because fault-controlled ambient and geothermal springs continued to flow lakewards. This recharge, in turn, limited pedogenesis: palaeosols are common in other rift floor sequences. Trona formed when aridity and evapoconcentration increased, but its precipitation also reflects increased magmatic CO2 that ascended along faults. Basin fragmentation and north-south fractures caused loss of cross-rift (east-west) drainage from rift-marginal basalts, resulting in reduced transition metals after 545 ka. The Magadi Basin demonstrates how a careful reconstruction of these complex tectono-climatic interactions is essential for accurate palaeoenvironmental reconstruction in continental rifts and in other tectonic settings.					; Sier, Mark/AAA-8778-2020; Deocampo, Daniel/A-9830-2010; Stockhecke, Mona/J-9346-2014; Shen, Chuan-Chou/JCE-1989-2023; Rabideaux, Nathan/K-7572-2015	Rabideaux, Nathan/0000-0002-3406-0541; Owen, Richard Bernhart/0000-0001-5267-5366; Stockhecke, Mona/0000-0002-5478-9540; Sier, Mark Jan/0000-0002-4145-0556; Campisano, Christopher/0000-0001-9530-6130; 													0031-0182	1872-616X				MAR 15	2019	518						97	118		10.1016/j.palaeo.2019.01.017	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2019.01.017													WOS:000459841500010

In the proximal basin, bottom deposits up to 60 in thick are generated ill part by turbid underflows associated with peak meltwater flow from the Devon Island Ice Cap. These underflows produce rhythmically laminated Structures that are likely varves. In shallower locations. accumulation is slower and results from homopycnal distribution of fine suspended sediment throughout the proximal basin, resulting in a simple varve couplet. The distal basin is isolated from glacial meltwater by a shallow sill, although some fine-grained detrital carbonate transported by the glacial meltwater is deposited in both basins. In most locations in the distal basin Holocene sediments are less than 10 in thick. They are composed primarily of massive clay and some carbonate interrupted by irregular graded carbonate units produced by sporadic heavy summer rainfall and sediment transport from small plateau tributaries. Eolian sedimentation is also important throughout the lake, especially when high accumulations melt through the ice in the proximal basin, producing isolated grains and layers of coarse sand in the sedimentary record. Holocene ice margin changes have influenced the sedimentary record substantially, particularly during the mid-Holocene when the ice cap is inferred to have retreated from the catchment.																			1523-0430					MAY	2002	34	2					130	141		10.2307/1552464	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1552464													WOS:000176962800002

Tracking the Limnoecological History of Lake Hiidenvesi (Southern Finland) Using the Paleolimnological Approach	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												We examined a sediment record from Lake Hiidenvesi in southern Finland using paleolimnological methods to trace its limnoecological history. In our record, beginning from the 1940s, chironomid (Diptera) assemblages shifted from typical boreal taxa towards mesotrophic community assemblages at similar to 1960-1980 CE being finally replaced by eutrophic taxa from the 1990s onward. The diatom (Bacillariophyceae) assemblages reflected relatively nutrient rich conditions throughout the record showing a further increase in eutrophic taxa from the 1970s onward. A chironomid-based reconstruction of late-winter hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen (DO) conditions suggested anoxic conditions already in the 1950s, probably reflecting increased inlake production due to allochthonous nutrient inputs and related increase in biological oxygen consumption. However, the reconstruction also indicated large variability in long-term oxygen conditions that appear typical for the basin. With regard to nutrient status, chironomid- and diatom-based reconstructions of total phosphorus (TP) showed a similar trend throughout the record, although, chironomids indicated a more straightforward eutrophication process in the benthic habitat and seemed to reflect the intensified human activities in the catchment more strongly than diatoms. The DO and TP reconstructions were mostly similar in trends compared to the measured data available since the 1970s/1980s. However, the increase in TP during the most recent years in both reconstructions was not visible in the monitored data. The results of our multiproxy study emphasize the significance of including both epilimnetic and hypolimnetic systems in water quality assessments and provide important long-term limnoecological information that will be useful in the future when setting targets for restoration.

J	Hang, T; Kohv, M				Hang, Tiit; Kohv, Marko			Glacial varves at Parnu, south-western Estonia: a local varve chronology and proglacial sedimentary environment	GFF												A new varve chronology comprising 584 consecutive varve years, varve thickness changes and proglacial sedimentary environment are analysed across the Pandivere-Neva (>13 300yrBP) belt of ice-recessional formations in coastal Estonia, eastern Baltic. Varved clays in the area have been deposited in the Baltic Ice Lake. All investigated sequences display a normal varve series with decreasing varve thickness upwards. According to the varve correlation, two groups of varve graphs could be distinguished: those representing sequences from the distal side and from the proximal side of the Pandivere-Neva ice marginal formations. Accumulation of varved clays started ca. 100yr earlier in the distal part. A massive clay unit with corresponding 20 silty varves in some sequences precedes the beginning of varve formation at the proximal part of the basin and could therefore correspond to a ca. 20yr long ice-stagnation period during the Pandivere-Neva Stade. Ice proximal conditions on both sides of the recessional formations (within 30km distance) ceased simultaneously within a period of 10-15yr, which is reflected in reduced total varve thickness accompanied with the beginning of winter layer dominance within a single varve. Because of post-sedimentary erosion, the length of the presented chronology underestimates the duration of proglacial conditions. Good visual correlation between the mean varve thickness graphs from the Parnu area and from Lake Peipsi, eastern Estonia, indicate the possible regional causes of varve thickness changes and simultaneous varve formation in two basins.					; Hang, Tiit/G-1510-2017	Hang, Tiit/0000-0002-8486-7052; 													1103-5897	2000-0863				DEC 1	2013	135	3-4			SI		273	281		10.1080/11035897.2013.775598	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11035897.2013.775598													WOS:000327571800007

Growth response of Microcystis spp. to iron enrichment in different regions of Lake Taihu, China	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Iron (Fe) is an essential micronutrient for algal growth and can be a potential limiting nutrient in aquatic system, especially regions that exhibits nitrogen (N) limitation. Using short-term nutrient addition bioassays, we evaluated the potential role that iron might play in modifying the response of Microcystis spp. to the anthropogenic phosphorus (P) and N enrichment in hypereutrophic Lake Taihu, the third largest freshwater lake in China. Three nutrient enrichment experiments involving additions of N (as NO3-) and P (as PO43-) with and without Fe were conducted during 2009-2010 in Meiliang Bay, a region characterized by summer cyanobacterial (Microcystis spp.) blooms, and East Taihu, a region largely free of cyanobacterial blooms and dominated by macrophytes. In Meiliang Bay, Fe addition alone did not significantly increase Microcystis spp. biomass. However, Fe addition occasionally increased the stimulatory effect of N and P additions on Microcystis spp., indicating that Fe was not a primary limiting nutrient for Microcystis spp. growth. Occasionally Fe was co-limiting with N and P in this region. In East Taihu, the addition of Fe alone significantly stimulated Microcystis spp. growth, while addition of N and/or P had no effects on growth, indicating that Fe was a primary limiting nutrient in East Taihu. The combined addition of Fe and N resulted in a growth response similar to Fe alone, while combined addition of Fe and P yielded greater biomass increases than the addition of Fe alone. This indicated that in East Taihu, N was not limiting and Fe and P supplies facilitated Microcystis spp. growth. These results reflect differential availabilities and limitations of N, P, and Fe in distinct regions of Taihu. The potential role of Fe in eutrophication dynamics of large, regionally complex lakes like Taihu requires further attention.					xu, hai/JEP-5422-2023; Qin, Boqiang/E-5900-2013; Paerl, Hans/ACA-9911-2022														0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN	2013	700	1					187	202		10.1007/s10750-012-1229-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-012-1229-3													WOS:000312073300016
S	Bright, J	Rosenbaum, JG; Kaufman, DS			Bright, Jordon	Rosenbaum, JG; Kaufman, DS		Ostracode endemism in Bear Lake, Utah and Idaho	PALEOENVIRONMENTS OF BEAR LAKE, UTAH AND IDAHO, AND ITS CATCHMENT	Geological Society of America Special Papers											Bear Lake, Utah and Idaho, is one of only a few lakes worldwide with endemic ostracode species. In most lakes, ostracode species distributions vary systematically with depth, but in Bear Lake, there is a distinct boundary in the abundances of cosmopolitan and endemic valves in surface sediments at similar to 7 m water depth. This boundary seems to coincide with the depth distribution of endemic fish, indicating a biological rather than environmental control on ostracode species distributions. The cosmopolitan versus endemic ostracode species distribution persisted through time in Bear Lake and in a neighboring wetland. The endemic ostracode fauna in Bear Lake implies a complex ecosystem that evolved in a hydrologically stable, but not invariant, environmental setting that was long lived. Long-lived ( geologic time scale) hydrologic stability implies the lake persisted for hundreds of thousands of years despite climate variability that likely involved times when effective moisture and lake levels were lower than today. The hydrologic budget of the lake is dominated by snowpack meltwater, as it likely was during past climates. The fractured and karstic bedrock in the Bear Lake catchment sustains local stream flow through the dry summer and sustains stream and ground-water flow to the lake during dry years, buffering the lake hydrology from climate variability and providing a stable environment for the evolution of endemic species.																			0072-1077		978-0-8137-2450-8				2009	450						197	216		10.1130/2009.2450(08)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/2009.2450(08)													WOS:000271276500009

Ice thickness and water level estimation for ice-covered lakes with satellite altimetry waveforms and backscattering coefficients	CRYOSPHERE												Lake ice, serving as a sensitive indicator of climate change, is an important regulator of regional hydroclimate and lake ecosystems. For ice-covered lakes, traditional satellite altimetry-based water level estimation is often subject to winter anomalies that are closely related to the thickening of lake ice. Despite recent efforts made to exploit altimetry data to resolve the two interrelated variables, i.e., lake ice thickness (LIT) and the water level of ice-covered lakes, several important issues remain unsolved, including the inability to estimate LIT with altimetric backscattering coefficients in ungauged lakes due to the dependence on in situ LIT data. It is still unclear what role lake surface snow plays in the retrieval of LIT and water levels in ice-covered lakes with altimetry data. Here we developed a novel method to estimate lake ice thickness by combining altimetric waveforms and backscattering coefficients without using in situ LIT data. To overcome complicated initial LIT conditions and better represent thick ice conditions, a logarithmic regression model was developed to transform backscattering coefficients into LIT. We investigated differential impact of lake surface snow on estimating water levels for ice-covered lakes when different threshold retracking methods are used. The developed LIT estimation method, validated against in situ data and cross-validated against modeled LIT, shows an accuracy of similar to 0.2 m and is effective at detecting thin ice that cannot be retrieved by altimetric waveforms. We also improved the estimation of water levels for ice-covered lakes with a strategy of merging lake water levels derived from different threshold methods. This study facilitates a better interpretation of satellite altimetry signals from ice-covered lakes and provides opportunities for a wider application of altimetry data to the cryosphere.

However, there is increasing evidence that other phytoplankton species which do not encyst are also capable of surviving ballast transit. These species have alternative modes of nutrition (hetero- or mixotrophy) and/or are able to survive long-term darkness. In our studies of no-ballast-on-board vessels arriving in the Great Lakes, we tested for the presence of the harmful algal bloom species Aureococcus anophagefferens (brown tide) in residual (i.e., unpumpable) ballast water using methods based on the PCR. During 2001, the brown tide organism was detected in 7 of 18 ballast water tanks in commercial ships following transit from foreign ports. Furthermore, it was detected after 10 days of ballast tank confinement during a vessel transit in the Great Lakes, a significant result given the large disparity between the salinity tolerance for active growth of Aureococcus (>22 ppt) and the low salinity of the residual ballast water (similar to2 ppt). We also investigated the potential for smaller, recreational vessels to transport and distribute Aureococcus. During the summer of 2002, 11 trailered boats from the inland bays of Delaware and coastal bays of Maryland were sampled. Brown tide was detected in the bilge water in the bottoms of eight boats, as well as in one live-well sample. Commercial ships and small recreational boats are therefore implicated as potential vectors for long-distance transport and local-scale dispersal of Aureococcus.

J	Sarvala, J; Helminen, H				Sarvala, Jouko; Helminen, Harri			Impacts of chemical precipitation of phosphorus with polyaluminum chloride in two eutrophic lakes in southwest Finland	INLAND WATERS												In an attempt to improve water quality in 2 eutrophic shallow Finnish lakes, Kirkkojarvi and Littoistenjarvi, phosphorus precipitation with polyaluminum chloride was performed in June 2002 and May 2017, respectively. Here we compare the effects of the chemical treatment between the lakes to enhance our understanding of the mechanisms involved and to improve the predictability of similar management actions in the future. All plankton was killed in the treatment, but phytoplankton recovered in 4 weeks and crustacean zooplankton in 2 months. Because removal fishing had not been successful, the chemical dosage in Kirkkojarvi was intentionally set so high that the treatment killed all fish. In Littoistenjarvi, pH was adjusted so that most fish survived. In Kirkkojarvi, the summer phosphorus (TP) and chlorophyll (Chl-a) concentrations 3 years after treatment dropped by 85% and 88% compared to those recorded 3 years before treatment. Cyanobacterial biomass declined by 88%, with only occasional blooms appearing in 3 of 22 years. The average TP and Chl-a of the post-treatment period 2006-2020 indicated substantial improvement in the ecological state from "bad" to "moderate" rating of the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD). In Littoistenjarvi, the corresponding declines due to the Al treatment were 72% in TP and 87% in Chl-a concentration, and 92% in cyanobacterial biomass. Longevity of treatment effects was estimated using the upper boundaries of the WFD quality classes as the target values. Water quality changes followed the internal loading of TP, affected by temperature and pH.					; Helminen, Harri/HZJ-8267-2023	Sarvala, Jouko/0000-0002-5016-3049; 													2044-2041	2044-205X				JUL 3	2023	13	3					412	427		10.1080/20442041.2023.2266177	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20442041.2023.2266177		JUL 2023											WOS:001140958900001

Horizontal Circulation Patterns in a Large Shallow Lake: Taihu Lake, China	WATER												Wind induced hydrodynamic circulations play significant roles in the transport and mixing process of pollutants and nutrients in large shallow lakes, but they have been usually overlooked, while environmental, biological, and ecological aspects of eutrophication problems get the most focus. Herein we use a three-dimensional model, driven by steady/unsteady wind, river discharge, rainfall, evaporation to investigate the spatially heterogeneous, large-scale hydrodynamic circulations and their role in transporting and mixing mechanisms in Taihu Lake. Wind direction and velocity determines the overall hydrodynamic circulation structure, i.e. direction, intensity, and position. A relative stable hydrodynamic circulation pattern has been formed shortly with steady wind (similar to 2 days). Vertical profiles of horizontal velocities are linearly correlated to the relative shallowness of water depth. Volume exchange between subbasins, influenced by wind speed and initial water level, differs due to the complex topography and irregular shape. With unsteady wind, these findings are still valid to a high degree. Vertical variations in hydrodynamic circulation are important in explaining the surface accumulation of algae scums in Meiliang Bay in summers. Vorticity of velocity field, a key indicator of hydrodynamic circulation, is determined by wind direction, bathymetry gradient, and water depth. The maximum change of velocity vorticity happens when wind direction is perpendicular to bathymetry gradient. Furthermore, Lagrangian-based tracer transport is used to estimate emergency pollution leakage impacts, and also to evaluate operational management measurements, such as, the large-scale water transfer. The conclusion is that the large-scale water transfer does not affect the hydrodynamic circulation and volume exchanges between subbasins significantly, but succeeds to transport and then mix the fresh, clean Yangtze River water to a majority area of Taihu Lake.					; Liu, Sien/AAK-7296-2020	ye, qinghua/0000-0002-8779-7707; Stive, Marcel/0000-0002-9820-6351; Liu, Sien/0000-0001-9773-231X; 														2073-4441				JUN	2018	10	6							792	10.3390/w10060792	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w10060792													WOS:000436515100123

QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												What was the impact of July temperature changes on vegetation patterns during the Lateglacial period in north-west Europe? Chironomid-inferred mean July air temperature estimates (C-Tjul) are proxy temperature records independent of terrestrial vegetation. The relationships between Lateglacial vegetation inferred from pollen percentages and these temperature estimates are explored using data synthesised geographically from 15 sites where both pollen percentages and C-Tjul are published to assess the influence of temperature and of temperature changes on regional vegetation. Direct impacts of temperature on a species involve passing the range limits or realised niche of that species. The Bolling warming allowed vegetation to develop. The Younger Dryas cooling had direct impacts on species and vegetation types that were at a critical ecotone and thus sensitive to change. Precipitation is extremely important and its interaction with temperature controlled most of the vegetation patterns inferred from these NW European pollen data. High precipitation was important in W Norway, whereas aridity in the YD was a controlling factor in N Norway, the Netherlands, and NE Germany. Under constant climate, ecological processes occurred such as immigration, succession, and soil development that resulted in vegetation changes. Biotic interactions were also important, such as the impact of grazing by mega-herbivores during Allerod time in Ireland that may have restricted the development of birch woodland. At the coarse scale of this synthesis, July temperature alone is seen not to be a good predictor of the patterns of pollen percentages and hence of vegetation through the Lateglacial. Rather, it is the interactions of temperature and precipitation, combined with ecological processes that appear to be the major factors influencing Lateglacial palynological and vegetation patterns in NW Europe.

Reproductive health of yellow perch Perca flavescens in selected tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Reduced recruitment of yellow perch has been noted for a number of years in certain urbanized watersheds (South and Severn Rivers) of the Chesapeake Bay. Other rapidly developing watersheds such as Mattawoman Creek are more recently showing evidence of reduced recruitment of anadromous fishes. In this study, we used a battery of biomarkers to better document the reproductive health of adult yellow perch collected during spring spawning in 2007-2009. Perch were collected in the South and Severn Rivers, Mattawoman Creek and the less developed Choptank and Allen's Fresh watersheds for comparison. Gonadosomatic indices, plasma reproductive hormone concentrations, plasma vitellogenin concentrations and gonad histology were evaluated in mature perch of both sexes. In addition, sperm quantity (cell counts) and quality (total and progressive motility, spermatogenic stage and DNA integrity), were measured in male perch. Many of these biomarkers varied annually and spatially, with some interesting statistical results and trends. Male perch from the Choptank and Allen's Fresh had generally higher sperm counts. In 2008 counts were significantly lower in the perch from the Severn when compared to other sites. The major microscopic gonadal abnormality in males was the proliferation of putative Leydig cells, observed in testes from Severn and less commonly, Mattawoman Creek perch. Observations that could significantly impact egg viability were an apparent lack of final maturation, abnormal yolk and thin, irregular zona pellucida. These were observed primarily in ovaries from Severn, South and less commonly Mattawoman Creek perch. The potential association of these observations with urbanization, impervious surface and chemical contaminants is discussed. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Holocene monsoon and sea-level variability from coastal lowlands of Kerala, SW India	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												The widespread Early Holocene sea-level rise observed along the global coastal realms reinvigorated the need to decipher sea-level variability on a local and regional scale, yet limited attempts were made on simultaneously addressing sea-level and climate variability. The southwest coast of India is endowed with several geomorphic features providing cues on the paleosea-level and climate variability engrossed with its sedimentary sequence in the lowlands. In view of this, the present study aims to decipher the Holocene sea-level and climate variability based on geochemical and palynological proxies supported by 10 AMS radiocarbon ages on a 32 m long sediment core (L7) raised from Upper Kuttanad Kole wetlands (Kuttoor), Kerala, Southwest India.The study demonstrated high sea-level along with warm and wet climate due to Indian summer monsoon (ISM) intensification during 9.69-7.56 ka corroborating with the Holocene Climate Optimum (HCO). However, a break in the sediment deposition is observed between 7.56 and 3.51 ka, the reason for which is yet to be fully understood. During 3.51-2.55 ka, the gradual weakening of ISM has been invoked with an intermittent monsoon spell during 3.20-3.40 ka. After 2.55 ka the sediment core records occurrence of coarser clastics indicating sediment deposition by the migrating distributary channel of the Pamba-Manimala rivers. The high sea level during HCO attests that the core location plausibly represented the southward extension of the Vembanad lagoon which transformed into part of the terrestrial system due to the gradual sea regression during the mid-late Holocene period followed by deposition of alluvial sediments from the hinterland rivers.

Health of white sucker within the St. Louis River area of concern associated with habitat usage as assessed using stable isotopes	ECOTOXICOLOGY												In Spring 2011, 200 adult white sucker were collected in four areas of the St. Louis River area of concern (AOC), located in Minnesota and Wisconsin, USA. The areas included the upper AOC as a reference area, the upper estuary, St. Louis Bay and Superior Bay. Grossly visible abnormalities were documented and preserved for microscopic analyses, as were five to eight representative pieces of liver tissue. A piece of dorsal muscle was preserved for stable isotope analyses and otoliths removed for age determination. The incidence of raised skin lesions (mucoid plaques) was high (31 %), however, microscopically only 4.5 % of the white suckers had neoplasia (papillomas). The remaining lesions were epidermal hyperplasia. Superior Bay had the lowest percentage of skin/lip lesions (10 %), while St. Louis Bay had the highest (44 %). St. Louis Bay also had the highest incidence of skin neoplasms (12 %). No hepatocellular neoplasms were documented, however bile duct tumors were observed in 4.5 % of the suckers. Foci of cellular alteration were observed in fish from all sites except the upper AOC. Stable isotope data indicated that most of the suckers relied on the St. Louis River AOC for the majority (> 75 %) of their diet, indicating they were resident within the AOC and not in Lake Superior. The amount of diet obtained from the upper estuary was a significant predictor of skin lesion incidence. Hence, habitat use within the AOC appears to be an important risk factor for skin and possibly, liver lesions.						H.

Robert; Hillery, John			Lake Michigan air quality: The 1994-2003 LADCO Aircraft Project (LAP)	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												The goal of the 1994 to 2003 LADCO Airplane Project (LAP) was to study ozone formation over Lake Michigan so that equitable regional control strategies could be devised. This paper for the first time documents LAP in the peer-reviewed literature. Dye et al. (1995) found that the atmosphere over Lake Michigan is stable in the summer due to the airwater temperature difference, which creates an efficient reaction chamber for ozone formation. They also hypothesize that the southwest winds characteristic of ozone-conducive conditions transport ozone further north over the lake before it crosses the shoreline onto land. This statistical analysis of LAP data support the hypothesis of Dye et al. Below 200 m above the lake, ozone formation is VOC-limited in the morning and becomes NOx limited in the afternoon. Above 200 m, ozone formation is NOx-limited throughout the day. The onshore NOx and VOC diurnal cycles peak during the early morning rush hour and are clearly linked to traffic patterns. Over the lake. VOC and NOy concentrations peak during the mid-morning rather than the early morning, supporting the hypothesis that the land breeze transports VOC and NOy over the lake. The diurnal NOx pattern over Lake Michigan is less clearly defined than the VOC pattern possibly as a result of emissions from five coal-burning power plants located on the Lake Michigan shoreline. Using a "photochemical clock" model, we estimate the climatological average hydroxyl radical concentration over the lake to be (9.43 +/- 5.88) x 106 molecule cm(-3) near Chicago and (8.43 +/- 3.68) x 106 molecule cm(-3) near Milwaukee.

Habitat Use by the Eastern Sand Darter, Ammocrypta pellucida, in Two Lake Champlain Tributaries	CANADIAN FIELD-NATURALIST												The Eastern Sand Darter (Ammocrypta pellucida) is endangered or threatened throughout much of its range, which includes the St. Lawrence-Lake Ontario drainage of southern Ontario and Quebec and several vermont tributaries of Lake Champlain. The species is known for its tendency to burrow, and field observatons have suggested that habitat use may depend on substrate particle size. To determine whether Eastern Sand Darter densities were correlated with substrate particle size, fish and substrates were sampled in 156 plots in two Vermont rivers during the summers of 2001 and 2002. The Eastern Sand Darter occurred mainly in areas in which substrate composition was over 45% fine to medium sand (0.24-0.54 mm): they were Much less abundant in areas in Which substrate composition exceeded 25% particles greater than 1.9 mm. Substrate preference was tested by allowing 49 fish kept in aquaria to choose among four different substrates. The fish showed a significant preference (P<0.005) for the finer substrate categories (0.24-0.54 turn, 0.55-1.0 mm). and mostly avoided the coarser substrates (1.0-1.9 mm, 2.0-4.1 mm). This suggests that the Eastern Sand Darter is selective regarding substrate composition, and therefore might be affected by fluctuations or changes in substrate composition within its habitat. such its those caused by changes in flow.																			0008-3550					JUL-SEP	2008	122	3					239	246		10.22621/cfn.v122i3.606	http://dx.doi.org/10.22621/cfn.v122i3.606													WOS:000207487500008

This study compared the injection force of Flex Touch with that of SoloStar (R) (sanofi-aventis, Paris, France) and KwikPen (R) (Eli Lilly & Co., Indianapolis, IN). Methods: Injection force was measured with the manufacturers' recommended needle attached to each pen (NovoFine (R) [Novo Nordisk] 32-gauge tip extra thin wall 6 mm needle for Flex Touch and BD [Franklin Lakes, NJ] MicroFine (TM) 31-gauge 5 mm needle for Solo Star and KwikPen) during injection of the maximum dose (60 IU for KwikPen and 80 IU for Flex Touch and Solo Star). Injection was performed at three different constant push-button speeds. Results: Flex Touch had a significantly (P<0.0001) lower injection force than SoloStar and KwikPen at all injection speeds. The mean +/- SD injection force of FlexTouch was 5.1 +/- 0.5 N. At 4, 6, and 8 mm/s push-button speeds, the injection force of SoloStar was 13.5 +/- 2.1, 19.1 +/- 1.9, and 26.9 +/- 2.4 N, respectively, and the injection force of KwikPen was 14.5 +/- 1.9, 20.9 +/- 1.4, and 28.2 +/- 1.4 N, respectively. Conclusions: The injection mechanism of FlexTouch means that insulin injection is driven by a torque spring and not the thumb pressure of the user. This results in a 62-82% lower injection force with FlexTouch than other prefilled insulin pens.																			1520-9156	1557-8593				DEC	2011	13	12					1207	1211		10.1089/dia.2011.0110	http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/dia.2011.0110								21864019					WOS:000298062500005

Therefore, the sediments document abundant information on climate change and its interaction with the fluviolacustrine system and paleoflooding. To date, late Holocene paleoflood records are limited, as continuous paleoflood archives are scarce. Here, using grain size end-members and sensitive components in combination with element records from the JH001 sediment core in the Jianghan Plain, nine continuous paleoflood regimes were identified during 3400-3000, 2750-2550, 2050-1820, 1800-1650, 1550-1500, 1350-1100, 1050-1000, 800-750, and 620-600 cal yr BP, respectively. Exploration of the climatic driving factors on flood regimes indicated a good agreement among paleoflood regimes and El Nin & SIM;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-related hydrological records in the Middle Yangtze Valley (MYV) and reconstructed ENSO records. This suggests that ENSO is the dominant influence on flood occurrence in the Jianghan Plain. Strong ENSO activity exerted a southward shift in the subtropical high in the western Pacific and produced a long-lasting rainbelt in the mid-lower Yangtze Valley, which induced the occurrence of floods in the Jianghan Plain. The evolution pattern of sedimentary environment demonstrated that the floods led to river overflow and overbank expansion, even causing the rivers to divert and bifurcate. The overflow channels carried and deposited silt sediments in the floodplain, which shaped the specific alluvial-lacustrine landscape of the Jianghan Plain. Our results indicate that the grain size of core sediments is sensitive to the occurrence of paleofloods, and that ENSO-related paleofloods significantly influenced the fluviolacustrine sedimentary evolution. These findings are highly useful for regional flood planning and environmental protection in the eastern Jianghan Plain in the context of global warming.																			0031-0182	1872-616X				MAR 1	2022	589								110834	10.1016/j.palaeo.2022.110834	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2022.110834		JAN 2022											WOS:000789393900002
J	Emslie, SD; Woehler, EJ				Emslie, SD; Woehler, EJ			A 9000-year record of Adelie penguin occupation and diet in the Windmill Islands, East Antarctica	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												We investigated 17 abandoned Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) colonies in the Windmill Islands, East Antarctica, in summer 2002/03. Forty radiocarbon dates on penguin bones and eggshells from 13 of these sites indicate a near continuous occupation by breeding penguins in this region for over 9000 years. These dates refine the recent geological record in this region and indicate that deglaciation of the northern islands occurred much earlier than previously suggested. Dietary remains from these sites include at least 23 taxa of cephalopods and teleost fish. Quantification of these remains indicates significant fluctuations in the relative abundance of two of the more common major prey taxa. The Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarcticum Boulenger) was the most common teleost prey during all time periods represented by the ages of the sites, but preservational factors may explain a gradual decrease in the remains of this species in increasingly older sites. The most common cephalopod in the sediments was the squid, Psychroteuthis glacialis Thiele, which occurred in low numbers in most sites except one (Site 75). An unusually high number of squid beaks preserved in Site 75, dating to approximately 5700-6100 cal. yr BP, does not correlate with a decrease in fish prey at that time. The high number of abandoned penguin colonies (> 200) in the Windmill Islands may be due to population cycles in the past in association with low nest-site fidelity and movement by breeding penguins to new sites within this region.

In spite of the recognition that many land-sea interfaces of the world are characterised by 'leaky' continental margins, it is unclear how important groundwater-derived springs and seeps are in terms of overall marine geochemical budgets. The principal reason that groundwater estimates have not caught up to the precision base typical of other oceanic inputs is that the direct discharge of groundwater into the coastal zone is inherently very difficult to measure. Concerted efforts are now being made to improve this situation by a variety of hydrological and oceanographic techniques. Standard hydrological approaches include measurement of the hydraulic gradient on land with flow being estimated either analytically or numerically. Groundwater flow is also assessed using standard water balance considerations. Unfortunately, the uncertainties in the data used for water balance calculations are often on the same scale as the flow being evaluated. Oceanographers have been using seepage meters, mini-piezometers and geochemical tracers to estimate submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) in the coastal zone. Hydrogeologists and oceanographers thus tend to approach the same problem fro different ends. Rarely are methodologies combined or more than one approach applied in the same study. We suggest that intercalibration experiments be designed in order to provide a more complete recognition of the strengths and weaknesses of various approaches. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Lithostratigraphy, Lithogeochemistry, and Tectono-Magmatic Framework of the ABM Replacement-Style Volcanogenic Massive Sulfide (VMS) Deposit, Finlayson Lake District, Yukon, Canada	ECONOMIC GEOLOGY												The Upper Devonian ABM deposit is a bimodal-felsic, replacement-style volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) deposit within the Finlayson Lake district in Yukon, Canada. The deposit is hosted by predominantly felsic volcanic rocks of the upper Kudz Ze Kayah formation that were deposited in an active back-arc basin in three sequences consisting of interbedded felsic volcaniclastic rocks and argillites, and felsic lava flows and domes, and felsic and mafic sills. The felsic rocks fall into two groups, Felsic A and Felsic B (FA and FB), based on immobile elements and their ratios. Relative to the FB group, the FA group has high Zr concentrations (>550 ppm) and generally higher contents of high field strength elements. The FA/FB chemostratigraphy roughly coincides with the lithostratigraphic sequences. Sequence 2 hosting the mineralization consists of FB felsic rocks; the hanging-wall Sequence 3 and footwall Sequence 1 felsic rocks have FA signatures. An argillite lens, recording a period of volcanic quiescence, occurs at the upper contact of Sequence 2. From reconstruction of the basin architecture, two sets of synvolcanic faults are inferred. The synvolcanic faults were interpreted based on thickness changes of volcanosedimentary units and the distribution of coherent rocks. During breaks in volcanism, synvolcanic faults acted as conduits for upwelling hydrothermal fluids, which were diverted laterally into unconsolidated volcaniclastic rocks and formed the replacement-style VMS mineralization. Although the mineralized lenses are hosted by FB felsic rocks, their replacement-style nature implies that the mineralizing processes occurred during the break in volcanism and were genetically associated with the overlying FA felsic volcanic rocks.																			0361-0128	1554-0774				SEP	2022	117	6					1299	1326		10.5382/econgeo.4930	http://dx.doi.org/10.5382/econgeo.4930													WOS:000827078800003

The upper 8.5 m were analyzed at 1-cm intervals for grain-size distribution to partition the grain-size components and provide a high-resolution proxy record of Holocene lake level changes. Partitioning of three to six components, C1, C2, C3 through C6 from fine to coarse modes within the individual polymodal distributions, into overlapping lognormal distributions, was accomplished utilizing the method of lognormal distribution function fitting. Genetic analyses of the grain-size components suggest that two major components, C2 and C3, interpreted as offshore-suspension fine and medium-to-coarse silt, can serve as sediment proxies for past changes in the level of Dali Lake. Lower modal sizes of both C2 and C3 and greater C3 and lower C2 percentages reflect higher lake stands. The proxy data from DL04 core sediments span the last 12,000 years and indicate that Dali Lake experienced five stages during the Holocene. During the interval ca. 11,500-9,800 cal year BP, lake level was unstable, with drastic rises and falls. Following that interval, the lake level was marked by high stands between ca. 9,800 and 7,100 cal year BP. During the period from ca. 7,100 to 3,650 cal year BP, lake level maintained generally low stands, but displayed a slight tendency to rise. Subsequently, the lake level continued rising, but exhibited high-frequency, high-amplitude fluctuations until ca. 1,800 cal years ago. Since ca. 1,800 cal year BP, the lake has displayed a gradual lowering trend with frequent fluctuations.																			0921-2728					AUG	2009	42	2					249	260		10.1007/s10933-008-9274-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-008-9274-7													WOS:000267825100007

Phytoplankton distribution in Lake Erie as assessed by a new in situ spectrofluorometric technique	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												In recent years, there has been concern about the trophic status of Lake Erie as phytoplankton and nutrients in some parts of the lake seem to have increased and toxic cyanobacterial species such as Microcystis aeruginosa have been reported. In the summer of 2002, a new in situ spectrofluorometric technique was used to survey phytoplankton on the lake-wide scale and determine the patterns of phytoplankton abundance and major taxonomic composition between regions of differing nutrient levels and dreissenid influence. Pigment fluorescence suggested substantial vertical and temporal variations of biomass and taxonomic composition, even within the epilimnion, on scales of meters and hours that conventional sampling would not resolve. The inferred phytoplankton biomass, expressed as total chlorophyll-a (chl-a), correlated well with chl-a estimated by traditional ethanol extraction and spectrophotometry. Average epilinmetic pigment biomass was highest in the west-central and west basins but appeared overall to be at or near historic lows. Fluorescence-inferred chl-a of diatoms and their relatives was generally dominant, followed by that of greens and cryptophytes. Estimates of average major taxonomic group composition were consistent with the most recent comparative data from traditional microscopic analysis. Two main incidents of toxic cyanobacterial occurrence were observed, one in the west basin and the other in the northern coastal zone of the east basin. Although very different in nutrient levels, both are areas in which substantial impacts of dreissenids on total phytoplankton abundance have been inferred previously.

Quaternary base-level drops and trigger mechanisms in a closed basin: Geomorphic and sedimentological studies of the Gastre Basin, Argentina	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Evaluating the role of tectonics and climate as possible triggering mechanisms of landscape reconfigurations is essential for paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic reconstructions. In this study an exceptional receptive closed Quaternary system of Patagonia (the Gastre Basin) is described, and examined in order to analyze factors triggering base-level drops. Based on a geomorphological approach, which includes new tectonic geomorphology investigations combined with sedimentological and stratigraphic analysis, three large-scale geomorphological systems were identified, described and linked to two major lake-level highstands preserved in the basin. The results indicate magnitudes of base-level drops that are several orders of magnitude greater than present-day water-level fluctuations, suggesting a triggering mechanism not observed in recent times. Direct observations indicating the occurrence of Quaternary faults were not recorded in the region. In addition, morphometric analyses that included mountain front sinuosity, valley width-height ratio, and fan apex position dismiss tectonic fault activity in the Gastre Basin during the middle.Pleistocene-Holocene. Therefore, we suggest here that upper Pleistocene climate changes may have been the main triggering mechanism of base-level falls in the Gastre Basin as it is observed in other closed basins of central Patagonia (i.e., Carri Laufquen Basin).

Sediments from an athalassic subsaline thermokarst lake on Herschel Island (69A degrees 36'N; 139A degrees 04'W, Canadian Arctic) were used to understand regional changes in climate and in sediment transport, hydrology, nutrient availability and permafrost disturbance. The sediment record spans the last similar to 11,700 years and the basal date is in good agreement with the Holocene onset of thermokarst initiation in the region. Electrical conductivity in pore water continuously decreases, thus indicating desalinization and continuous increase of lake size and water level. The inc/coh ratio of XRF scans provides a high-resolution organic-carbon proxy which correlates with TOC measurements. XRF-derived Mn/Fe ratios indicate aerobic versus anaerobic conditions which moderate the preservation potential of organic matter in lake sediments. The coexistence of marine, brackish and freshwater ostracods and foraminifera is explained by (1) oligohaline to mesohaline water chemistry of the past lake and (2) redeposition of Pleistocene specimens found within upthrusted marine sediments around the lake. Episodes of catchment disturbance are identified when calcareous fossils and allochthonous material were transported into the lake by thermokarst processes such as active-layer detachments, slumping and erosion of ice-rich shores. The pollen record does not show major variations and the pollen-based climate record does not match well with other summer air temperature reconstructions from this region. Local vegetation patterns in small catchments are strongly linked to morphology and sub-surface permafrost conditions rather than to climate. Multidisciplinary studies can identify the onset and life cycle of thermokarst lakes as they play a crucial role in Arctic freshwater ecosystems and in the global carbon cycle of the past, present and future.					; Lantuit, Hugues/ABC-8692-2020; Frenzel, Peter/F-5247-2012; Fritz, Michael/J-5047-2015; Wetterich, Sebastian/AAD-6569-2019	Lantuit, Hugues/0000-0003-1497-6760; Unkel, Ingmar/0000-0002-8940-1657; Wetterich, Sebastian/0000-0001-9234-1192; Lenz, Josefine/0000-0002-4050-3169; Fritz, Michael/0000-0003-4591-7325; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				JUN	2018	60	1					77	96		10.1007/s10933-018-0025-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-018-0025-0													WOS:000433520600005

The present study investigated the spatial heterogeneity of stream temperature (ST), and the role of landscape variables, at 20 locations along the 195 km course of the intensively managed lowland River Spree (NE Germany) over a period of nine months. Along the river, four distinct thermal sections were identified, created by thermal discontinuities induced by lakes and an urban area. Three approaches, namely heat budget modelling (estimating the unresolved residual heat flux), both in Eulerian and Lagrangian form, semi-empirical air2stream modelling, and statistical correlations were applied to quantify the observed thermal heterogeneity and the role of climatic (air temperature) and landscape variables (land use, lakes, stream azimuth). Urban areas and lakes were identified as heat sources (in summer), which induced ST discontinuities at different time scales (daily, monthly and during the entire study period). Statistical correlations showed that heat inputs and ST increased with increasing urban area and decreased with distance from lakes. Furthermore, comparison of observed STs and those simulated via the Lagrangian model revealed that heat advection was the dominant thermal process in a lake-influenced section and persisted over a distance of up to 20 km. Simulations showed that this effect could not be significantly diminished even by complete riparian shading along the section, as the sub-daily ST reduced by an average of only 1.5 degrees C. Hence, plantation of riparian buffers should be complemented with additional mitigation measures such as improving the groundwater table recharge, managing the temperature of urban discharges, to mitigate climate change impacts on ST.

The research material was HA extracted from lake sediments. Sediment samples were collected in the summer stagnation, from maximum depth of each lake. Humic acids extraction was performed using the method proposed by the International Humic Substances Society. In extracted HA, the elemental composition, free radical content, UV-Vis, and EEM fluorescence spectra were determined. EEM spectral modeling was performed using a multidirectional statistical method-parallel factor analysis PARAFAC. Four specific, two protein-like (C2 and C4) and humic- and fulvic-like (C1 and C3) components, components responsible for emission of fluorescence were identified in HA extracted from lake sediments. In the obtained EEM spectra, the dominant component was C2, while the smallest participation have C4 component. The mean contribution of C3 and C1 components to the total intensity of fluorescence was almost the same and was about 25%. Significant correlations were obtained between the concentration of EEM components and parameters characterizing the chemical properties of sediments and humic acids. The study showed that the EEM fluorescence spectroscopy can be successfully used to characterize natural organic matter in aquatic environments. This method may provide supplementary information on the origin and transformation of organic matter in the water environments. By applying the parameters obtained from PARAFAC modeling, the relative degree of organic matter transformation (component C1) and autotrophic productivity (component C3) may be assessed. The analysis of the component C1 and C4 complete the information about the organic matter origin.

Model predictions were compared to empirical results of laboratory experiments measuring interactions among thermal stress, toxin exposure, and low food on reproduction and survival of two species of cladoceran zooplankton. Stress was defined operationally as a reduction in reproduction or survival relative to optimal conditions over a 7-d period. These experiments are particularly applicable to episodic stresses such as those associated with short-term heat waves. Toxin or low food in combination with 30 degrees C temperatures were generally more harmful than high temperature alone. However, most multiple stress effects were antagonistic, in that effects in combination were not as severe as predicted based on the sum or the product of their individual effects. In rare cases, interaction among stressors even diminished effects of the worst single stressor. Optimal conditions for reproduction and survival occurred at 25 degrees C, high food and 0 mg liter(-1) toxin (a surfactant, sodium dodecyl sulfate). Suppressive effects of stressors examined individually ranked: high temperature (30 degrees C) > SDS (10 mg liter(-1) greater than or equal to low food (similar to 100 mu g C liter(-1)) > low temperature (20 degrees C). Daphnia pulex isolated from a pond which experiences high summer temperatures throughout was more tolerant of 30 degrees C conditions than Daphnia pulicaria isolated from a lake with a cold-water refuge. Differences were observed in individuals exposed as either adults or as 24-h neonates.																			0024-3590					MAY	1999	44	3	2				864	877		10.4319/lo.1999.44.3_part_2.0864	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1999.44.3_part_2.0864													WOS:000080326600011

However, the spatio-temporal variability of CH4 fluxes from waterbodies complicates spatial extrapolation of CH4 measurements from single waterbodies. Therefore, their contribution to the CH4 budget of the arctic permafrost zone is not yet well understood. Using the example of two study areas of 1,000km(2) each in the Mackenzie Delta, Canada, we approach this issue (i) by analyzing correlations on the landscape scale between numerous waterbodies and CH4 fluxes and (ii) by analyzing the influence of the spatial resolution of CH4 flux data on the detected relationships. A CH4 flux map with a resolution of 100m was derived from two aircraft eddy-covariance campaigns in the summers of 2012 and 2013. We combined the CH4 flux map with high spatial resolution (2.5m) waterbody maps from the Permafrost Region Pond and Lake Database and classified the waterbody depth based on Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter data. Subsequently, we reduced the resolution of the CH4 flux map to analyze if different spatial resolutions of CH4 flux data affected the detectability of relationships between waterbody coverage, number, depth, or size and the CH4 flux. We did not find consistent correlations between waterbody characteristics and the CH4 flux in the two study areas across the different resolutions. Our results indicate that waterbodies in permafrost landscapes, even if they seem to be emission hot spots on an individual basis or contain zones of above average emissions, do currently not necessarily translate into significant CH4 emission hot spots on a regional scale, but their role might change in a warmer climate.

Bayani			Water and carbon fluxes from a supra-permafrost aquifer to a stream across hydrologic states	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Supra-permafrost aquifers within the active layer are present in the Arctic during summer. Permafrost thawing due to Arctic warming can liberate previously frozen particulate organic matter (POM) in soils to leach into groundwater as dissolved organic carbon (DOC). DOC transport from groundwater to surface water is poorly understood because of the unquantified variability in subsurface properties and hydrological environments. These dynamics must be better characterized because DOC transport to surface waters is critical to predict the long-term fate of recently thawed carbon in permafrost environments. Here, we used distributed Darcy's Law calculations to quantify groundwater and DOC fluxes into Imnavait Creek, Alaska, a representative headwater stream in a continuous permafrost watershed. We developed a statistical ensemble approach to model the parameter variability and range of potential contributions of steady-state groundwater flow to the creek. We quantified the model prediction uncertainty using statistical sampling of in-situ, active-layer soil hydrostratigraphy (water table, ice table, and soil stratigraphy), high-resolution topography data, and DOC data. Moreover, the predicted groundwater discharge values representing all possible hydrologic conditions towards the end of the thawing season were also considered given the potential variability in saturation. The model predictions were similar to and span most of the observed range of Imnavait Creek streamflow, especially during recession periods, and also during saturation excess overland flow. As the Arctic warms and supra-permafrost aquifers deepen, groundwater flow is expected to increase. This increase is expected to impact stream, river, and lake biogeochemical processes by dissolving and mobilizing more soil constituents in continuous permafrost regions. This study highlights how quantifying the uncertainty of hydro-stratigraphical input parameters helps understand and predict supra-permafrost aquifer dynamics and connectivity to aquatic systems using a simple, but scalable, modeling approach.

The model was developed using data from one area of coastal Tanzania and validated with independent data from different areas of the country. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate the model's predictive performance. The model allows reasonable discrimination between high and low prevalence schools, at least within those geographical areas in which they were originally developed, and performs reasonably well in other coastal areas, but performs poorly by comparison in the Great Lakes area of Tanzania. These results may be explained by reference to an ecological zone map based on RS-derived environmental data, This map suggests that areas where the model reliably predicts a high prevalence of schistosomiasis fall within the same ecological zone, which has common intermediate-host snail species responsible for transmission. By contrast, the model's performance is poor near Lake Victoria, which is in a different ecological zone with different snail species, The ecological map can potentially define a template for those areas where existing models can be applied, and highlight areas where further data and models are required. The developed model was then used to provide estimates of the number of schoolchildren at risk of high prevalence and associated programme costs.

Spatial and temporal patterns in physical properties and dissolved oxygen in Lake Diefenbaker, a large reservoir on the Canadian Prairies	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Lake Diefenbaker (LD) is a multi-purpose deep storage reservoir with complex longitudinal zonation. Despite the importance of LD to Saskatchewan, the last comprehensive evaluation of this large reservoir was completed 30 years ago. Therefore, an assessment of key features (patterns in stratification, turbidity, and dissolved oxygen (DO)) was undertaken during the ice-free period of 2011-2013 to characterize conditions that may affect water quality, including climate change. In addition, these features were compared with the expectations of the longitudinal zonation concept (LZC) of Kimmel and Groeger (1984). The reservoir was dimictic, and summer mixing depths (10-20 m) were similar between a drought year (1984) and the current study. Sections of the hypolimnia became hypoxic, or were sub-optimal for cold and cool water fish (<= 5 mg/L). Volumetric hypolimnetic oxygen depletion rates were 0.034 to 0.12 mg L/day and overlapped with other lakes and reservoirs. Sections of LD would be prone to hypolimnetic anoxia had thermal stratification been prolonged for another 2 to 4 weeks. LD experienced three years of above average peak flows. The peak flow of 2013 brought high turbidity (e.g., 200 NTU) and organic matter that resulted in a metalimnetic DO minimum. Spatial patterns in thermal stratification and turbidity (but not DO) followed the expectations of the LZC. Drought conditions of 1984 resulted in reduced hypolimnetic volumes, anoxic conditions and algal blooms. Therefore, as the Northern Plains continue to warm, monitoring of Lake Diefenbaker during drought periods is warranted, especially when droughts follow high flow events.

Observing low-altitude features in ozone concentrations in a shoreline environment via uncrewed aerial systems	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES												Ozone is a pollutant formed in the atmosphere by photochemical processes involving nitrogen oxides (NO x ) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) when exposed to sunlight. Tropospheric boundary layer ozone is regularly measured at ground stations and sampled infrequently through balloon, lidar, and crewed aircraft platforms, which have demonstrated characteristic patterns with altitude. Here, to better resolve vertical profiles of ozone within the atmospheric boundary layer, we developed and evaluated an uncrewed aircraft system (UAS) platform for measuring ozone and meteorological parameters of temperature, pressure, and humidity. To evaluate this approach, a UAS was flown with a portable ozone monitor and a meteorological temperature and humidity sensor to compare to tall tower measurements in northern Wisconsin. In June 2020, as a part of the WiscoDISCO20 campaign, a DJI M600 hexacopter UAS was flown with the same sensors to measure Lake Michigan shoreline ozone concentrations. This latter UAS experiment revealed a low-altitude structure in ozone concentrations in a shoreline environment showing the highest ozone at altitudes from 20-100 m a.g.l. These first such measurements of low-altitude ozone via a UAS in the Great Lakes region revealed a very shallow layer of ozone-rich air lying above the surface.

Eutrophication and other issues are prominent. Taking the artificial Playground Lake in Zhenjiang as an example, a numerical model combining particle tracing, hydrodynamics, water quality and eutrophication was constructed to simulate the water quality improvement in Playground Lake with or without water diversion by pump and sluice. Simulation results using particle tracking showed that the water residence time depended on wind direction: east wind, 125 h; southeast wind, 115 h; south wind, 95 h. With no water diversion, the lower the flow velocity of Playground Lake under three wind fields, the more serious the eutrophication. Under pump diversion, the water body in Playground Lake can be entirely replaced by water diversion for 30 h. When the temperature is lower than 15 degrees C, from 15 degrees C to 25 degrees C and higher than 25 degrees C, the water quality can be maintained for 15 d, 10 d and 7 d, respectively. During high tide periods of spring tides in the Yangtze River from June to August, the water can be diverted into the lake through sluices. The greater the Delta h (the water head between the Yangtze River and Playground Lake), the more the water quality will improve. Overall, the good-to-bad order of water quality improvements for Playground Lake is as follows: pumping 30 h > sluice diversion > no water diversion. This article is relevant for the environmental management of the artificial Playground Lake, and similar lakes elsewhere.					; song, weiwei/ADA-3788-2022	Zhang, Peng/0000-0002-2972-3566; Song, Weiwei/0000-0002-7430-730X; Li, Lanyimin/0000-0002-2838-6035														2071-1050				MAR	2018	10	3							867	10.3390/su10030867	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10030867													WOS:000428567100294
J	Snyder, RJ; Schregel, WD; Wei, YH				Snyder, Randal J.; Schregel, William D.; Wei, Yuanhong			Effects of thermal acclimation on tissue fatty acid composition of freshwater alewives (Alosa pseudoharengus)	FISH PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY												In this study, we examine changes in fatty acid composition of polar and neutral lipids in gill, liver, and muscle of freshwater alewives (Alosa pseudoharengus) after temperature challenges in the laboratory. Alewives experienced either a warm or cold challenge in which temperatures were raised or lowered 0.5 degrees C day(-1) over 4-6 weeks. In alewives experiencing the cold challenge, gill polar lipids showed evidence of significant remodeling, including decreases in palmitic acid and saturated fatty acids and increases in n-3 and n-6 highly unsaturated fatty acids including docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonic acid. In alewives experiencing the warm challenge, we observed significant increases in saturated fatty acids (due mainly to increased palmitic acid) and decreases in polyunsaturated fatty acids in polar lipids of muscle and liver tissue. Fish that died during the cold challenge had significantly higher levels of palmitic acid in muscle polar lipids compared to fish that survived; fish that died during the warm challenge displayed complex changes in fatty acid composition. Based on theoretical considerations, the changes in polar lipids we observed during thermal acclimation are likely to promote appropriate membrane fluidity under each thermal regime. The increased incorporation of highly unsaturated fatty acids during cold acclimation could have significant physiological and ecological implications. In particular, since highly unsaturated fatty acids are typically scarce in freshwater food webs, dietary deficiencies in these essential fatty acids may be a significant factor in winter mortality of freshwater alewives.																			0920-1742	1573-5168				APR	2012	38	2					363	373		10.1007/s10695-011-9513-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10695-011-9513-0								21638009					WOS:000304117000008

Three sites representing distinct geomorphic areas (Ridge and Valley province, Piedmont and Fall Line) were sampled monthly from April 1988 through June 1989. Two species of crayfish, Orconectes virilis and Cambarus bartoni, were collected. Orconectes virilis was only collected from the Ridge and Valley site, whereas C. bartoni was collected from all three sites. Both species had a minimum possible 24-mo lifespan, although few individuals survived past 18 mo. Females extruded eggs in April and by June young were no longer carried by females. Highest growth rates occurred in May and June, during which 68-86% of annual production occurred. The Ridge and Valley site had the greatest abundance of the preferred cobble and boulder substrate. It also had the highest substrate-weighted density (0.4 individuals/m2), biomass (129 mg AFDM/m2) and annual production (155 mg AFDM/m2) of crayfish. Density, biomass and production were much lower at the other two sites, annual substrate-weighted production being only 8-14 mg AFDM/m2. P/B ratios were 0.7-1.1. The predominance of unsuitable habitat, especially a highly embedded substrate, was a primary factor causing the low biomass and production at all three sites.																			0003-0031					OCT	1991	126	2					353	363		10.2307/2426111	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2426111													WOS:A1991GM89100012

Effects of a rapidly increasing population of common carp on vegetative cover and waterfowl in a recently restored Midwestern shallow lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Although the common carp (Cyprinus carpio), an invasive benthic fish from Eurasia, has long been strongly implicated in the disappearance of vegetative cover and reduced waterfowl abundance in North American shallow lakes, the details of this relationship are obscure. This study documented ecological changes in a recently restored shallow lake (Hennepin and Hopper Lakes, IL, USA) at a time that it was experiencing a large increase in its carp population. We estimated the abundance and biomass of carp 7 years after this lake had been restored and then back-calculated carp population size across time while examining changes in the lake's plant and waterfowl communities. We found that the biomass of carp remained below similar to 30 kg/ha for 5 years following restoration, but then increased to similar to 100 kg/ha in the sixth year following a strong recruitment event. Although a carp biomass of <30 kg/ha had no discernible effects on vegetative cover (which exceeded 90%) or waterfowl (which exceeded 150,000 individuals during fall censuses), the increase to 100 kg/ha was associated with a similar to 50% decrease in both vegetative cover and waterfowl. A further increase in carp biomass to over 250 kg/ha during the seventh year coincided with a decrease in the vegetative cover to 17% of the lake's surface and a decline in waterfowl use to similar to 10% of its original value. These data suggest that the common carp is extremely damaging to the ecological integrity of shallow lakes when its density exceeds similar to 100 kg/ha. Since the biomass of carp in Midwestern shallow lakes commonly exceeds this value by 3-4 times, it seems likely that carp are responsible for the large-scale habitat deterioration described in many of these ecosystems.

Weighted mean concentrations of total N and total P during the ice-free period of collection were 1.91 mg N/l and 0.105 mg P/l. Winter concentrations of total N were similar, but total P concentrations were much lower, averaging 0.013 mg/l in fresh snow. Total atmospheric loading of P to the lake was 74.4 mg P/m2 per yr, and the total N loading was 1600 mg N/m2 per yr. About 52%, or 39.0 mg P/m2 per yr, of the total P loading from the atmosphere was total dissolved P (0.22 .mu.m filtrate) and 28%, or 20.6 mg P/m2 per yr, of the total P loading was dissolved reactive P (''orthophosphate'' P). Dissolved inorganic N loading at 1010 mg N/m2 per yr comprised about 63% of the total N loading from the atmosphere. Pollen, from a variety of trees surrounding the lake, contributed about 20% of the total P input. The pH of rainfall samples ranged from 3.2-5.1 with a median value of 3.9 (n = 14).																			0043-1397	1944-7973					1978	14	4					589	592		10.1029/WR014i004p00589	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/WR014i004p00589													WOS:A1978FM75300006

The Ulmus Decline at this site has been consistently dated to ca. 4700 C-14 years BP. The microcharcoal records from these two very closely adjacent points, which must have had virtually identical microcharcoal source areas, are assessed for their degrees of similarity and variability at 1 cm vertical sampling intervals, in an investigation which parallels a previous comparative pollen study of the two profiles. The microcharcoal curves were found to correspond well, suggesting that microcharcoal records from small peat mires within forested catchments have fine spatial integrity, are reproducible and can be interpreted securely as reliable records of fire history in their small source areas. Much variation occurred at the level of individual spectra within coeval zones which must record the same fire history and ecology however, producing differently shaped microcharcoal curves. While the record of major trends will be accurate, therefore, too precise an interpretation of microcharcoal data at this temporal scale may not be justified. Microspatial variations in frequencies of fungal spores associated with local burning are also presented and evaluated. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Palynological records from glacial lakes, northern Priokhotye (western Beringia)	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Palynological analyzes of sediments from glacial lakes in Northern Priokhot'ye provide the first continuous records of regional vegetation responses to climate change at the end of the Pleistocene and during the Holocene. The pollen stratigraphy from these coastal sites is like that described for more northern regions of Western Beringia. Herb dominated tundra with Poaceae-forb meadows characterized the Late Pleistocene and was replaced c. 12,100 cal BP by Betula shrub tundra and then by shrub Betula-Alnus tundra. In the Middle Holocene (c. 8900-4700 cal BP), Larix-Betula platyphylla forests with an undergrowth of Pinus pumila, shrub Betula, and Alnus became widespread. Pinus pumila also formed a high shrub tundra zone above altitudinal treeline. Finds of Betula platyphylla macrofossils suggest that summer temperatures were 2-4 C-degrees warmer than today between c. 7700 and 6700 cal BP. Variations in Pinus pollen percentages during the Middle and Late Holocene suggest changes in altitudinal treeline related to intervals of relatively cooler or warmer climates. The timing of the postglacial thermal maximum and possible shifts in altitudinal treeline suggest paleoclimatic patterns that are more like southern areas of the Russian Far East than northern regions of Western Beringia. A Late Holocene tephra was found for the first time in the lake sediments and peat exposures of Northern Priokhotye. The most likely source of this important chronostratigraphic horizon is the Shiveluch volcanic eruption (Kamchatka Peninsula) dated to 2500-2600 BP (2580-2730 cal BP).

Risky business: Modeling mortality risk near the urban-wildland interface for a large carnivore	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION												We examined the spatial distribution of 382 black bear (Ursus americanus) mortalities in the Lake Tahoe Basin and Western Great Basin Desert (WGB) in Nevada, USA from 1997 to 2013. Of the 364 mortalities for which we could determine cause of death, vehicle collisions (n = 160) and direct removal of bears by management personnel (n = 132) were the two largest sources of mortality for bears in our study area at the confluence of the Sierra-Nevada Mountains and the Great Basin Desert. Here we use logistic regression and resource selection probability functions (RSPF) to model probability of mortality in the WGB based on anthropogenic and landscape variables. Further, we assessed the impact of spatial resolution on our analyses and resulting probability of mortality models. Human-induced mortalities of black bears were overwhelmingly concentrated near major roads (defined in our analyses as paved roads with two lanes or more), in the town of Incline Village, Nevada, and along the foothills of the Carson Range east of Lake Tahoe. Our results suggest mortality risk is associated with density of and distance to multiple forest types, human population density, landcover, recreation site density and distance, road density and distance, stream distance, hiking trail density, and waterbody distance. Our model results found environmental variables measured at coarse spatial resolutions such as distance to and density of forest best predicted black bear mortality risk, while anthropogenic variables measured at fine spatial resolutions like distance to and density of recreation site best predicted black bear mortality risk in our study area. Our results demonstrate that carnivore mortality as a phenomenon likely operates at multiple spatial resolutions and thus considering scale is important for modeling mortality risk on the landscape.

J	Yang, XK; Lu, XX; Park, E; Tarolli, P				Yang, Xiankun; Lu, Xixi; Park, Edward; Tarolli, Paolo			Impacts of Climate Change on Lake Fluctuations in the Hindu Kush-Himalaya-Tibetan Plateau	REMOTE SENSING												Lakes in the Hindu Kush-Himalaya-Tibetan (HKHT) regions are crucial indicators for the combined impacts of regional climate change and resultant glacier retreat. However, they lack long-term systematic monitoring and thus their responses to recent climatic change still remain only partially understood. This study investigated lake extent fluctuations in the HKHT regions over the past 40 years using Landsat (MSS/TM/ETM+/OLI) images obtained from the 1970s to 2014. Influenced by different regional atmospheric circulation systems, our results show that lake changing patterns are distinct from region to region, with the most intensive lake shrinking observed in northeastern HKHT (HKHT Interior, Tarim, Yellow, Yangtze), while the most extensive expansion was observed in the western and southwestern HKHT (Amu Darya, Ganges Indus and Brahmaputra), largely caused by the proliferation of small lakes in high-altitude regions during 1970s-1995. In the past 20 years, extensive lake expansions (similar to 39.6% in area and similar to 119.1% in quantity) were observed in all HKHT regions. Climate change, especially precipitation change, is the major driving force to the changing dynamics of the lake fluctuations; however, effects from the glacier melting were also significant, which contributed approximately 31.9-40.5%, 16.5-39.3%, 12.8-29.0%, and 3.3-6.1% of runoff to lakes in the headwaters of the Tarim, Amu Darya, Indus, and Ganges, respectively. We consider that the findings in this paper could have both immediate and long-term implications for dealing with water-related hazards, controlling glacial lake outburst floods, and securing water resources in the HKHT regions, which contain the headwater sources for some of the largest rivers in Asia that sustain 1.3 billion people.					; Park, Edward/JCD-7857-2023; Lu, Xi/C-5609-2008; Tarolli, Paolo/C-2866-2009	YANG, X.K./0000-0003-1303-195X; Park, Edward/0000-0002-1299-1724; Tarolli, Paolo/0000-0003-0043-5226; 														2072-4292				MAY 1	2019	11	9							1082	10.3390/rs11091082	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs11091082													WOS:000469763600090

Color increased with DOG, as did total dissolved nitrogen (TDN). The colar/DOC and DOC/TDN quotients also rose with increasing DOG, indicating a change in the quality of dissolved organic matter with increasing wetland influence. Dissolved Fe, and to a much lesser extent dissolved Al, showed a strong positive correlation with DOG. Stream pH showed a strong negative correlation with DOG, largely from wetlands, and a strong positive correlation with non-marine Ca2+ weathered from mineral soils. Non-marine SO42- from acid deposition had no apparent influence on stream pH and decreased with increasing streamwater DOC in summer, presumably owing to reduction processes in wetlands that mitigated the effects of acid deposition. Apparently, these reduction processes also produced small amounts of dissolved, non-ionic organic sulfur. Non-marine Ca2+ was related strongly to the percentage of upland hardwood forests in the catchments. Wetlands exert a profound influence on the chemistry of streams, principally through their export of DOC but also because of reduction reactions in their anerobic peats.																			0277-5212	1943-6246				MAR	1998	18	1					115	132		10.1007/BF03161449	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF03161449													WOS:000072925900013

The mean diameter, which varied from 48 to 61 nm, was inversely related to p(c), in keeping with the theory of strength of thin-walled rigid cylinders. These measurements extended the range of p(c)-width relationship of gas vesicles, which can be described by the expression p(c) = 461(d/nm)(-1.53) MPa, p(c) was correlated with gas vesicle genotype (see the accompanying paper by S. J. Beard, B. A. Handley, P. K. Hayes & A. E. Walsby, Microbiology 145, 2757-2768): of the 81 strains investigated, all those with the gas vesicle genotype GV2 produced gas vesicles with a mean p(c) of less than 1.0 MPa, whereas those of GV3 had a mean p(c) of greater than 1.0 MPa. It is suggested that gas vesicles of the GV3 strains, which are narrower and stronger than any previously recorded in freshwater cyanobacteria, have evolved to withstand the high hydrostatic pressures during deep winter mixing in Lake Zurich.																			1350-0872					OCT	1999	145		10				2769	2775		10.1099/00221287-145-10-2769	http://dx.doi.org/10.1099/00221287-145-10-2769								10537198					WOS:000083156200016

Substantial long-term loss of alpha and gamma diversity of lake invertebrates in a landscape exposed to a drying climate	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Many regions across the globe are shifting to more arid climates. For shallow lakes, decreasing rainfall volume and timing, changing regional wind patterns and increased evaporation rates alter water regimes so that dry periods occur more frequently and for longer. Drier conditions may affect fauna directly and indirectly through altered physicochemical conditions in lakes. Although many studies have predicted negative effects of such changes on aquatic biodiversity, empirical studies demonstrating these effects are rare. Global warming has caused severe climatic drying in southwestern Australia since the 1970s, so we aimed to determine whether lakes in this region showed impacts on lake hydroperiod, water quality, and alpha, beta and gamma diversity of lake invertebrates from 1998 to 2011. Seventeen lakes across a range of salinities were sampled biennially in spring in the Wheatbelt and Great Southern regions of Western Australia. Multivariate analyses were used to identify changes in alpha, beta and gamma diversity and examine patterns in physicochemical data. Salinity and average rainfall partially explained patterns in invertebrate richness and assemblage composition. Climatic drying was associated with significant declines in lake depth, increased frequency of dry periods, and reduced alpha and gamma diversity (gamma declined from similar to 300 to similar to 100 taxa from 1998 to 2011 in the 17 wetlands). In contrast, beta diversity remained consistently high, because each lake retained a distinct fauna. Mean alpha diversity per-lake declined both in lakes that dried and lakes that did not dry out, but lakes which retained a greater proportion of their maximum depth retained more alpha diversity. Accumulated losses in alpha diversity caused the decline in gamma diversity likely through shrinking habitat area, fewer stepping stones for dispersal and loss of specific habitat types. Biodiversity loss is thus likely from lakes in drying regions globally. Management actions will need to sustain water depth in lakes to prevent biodiversity loss.					; Robson, Belinda/G-4694-2010; Halse, Stuart/GXF-7832-2022; Atkinson, Sean/LZH-3675-2025	Robson, Belinda/0000-0002-9215-3666; Atkinson, Sean/0009-0000-0355-9545; 													1354-1013	1365-2486				DEC	2021	27	23					6263	6279		10.1111/gcb.15890	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.15890		OCT 2021						34534383					WOS:000705536500001
J	Jürgens, K; Jeppesen, E				Jürgens, K; Jeppesen, E			The impact of metazooplankton on the structure of the microbial food web in a shallow, hypertrophic lake	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Shallow, hypertrophic Lake Sobygard is characterized by strong fluctuations in the plankton community structure over short time scales, and cascading predation effects from higher to lower trophic levels. We examined the coupling between the classical and microbial food web for al month period, during which the typical zooplankton summer succession from rotifers (mainly Brachionus spp.) to cyclopoid copepods and daphnids occurred. In addition to the analysis of the plankton succession, we performed mesocosm experiments, comparing the microbial community structure in treatments with and without metazooplankton. We focused on the development of different functional groups within the microbial food web: total heterotrophic bacteria, filamentous bacteria (as grazing-resistant forms), prokaryotic and eukaryotic, autotrophic picoplankton (pAPP and eAPP), heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) and ciliates. During the first experiment, the metazooplankton was dominated by rotifers which exerted only moderate top-down control on small ciliates, HNF and APP. Cascading predation effects were visible after the collapse of the rotifer population; enhanced protozoan grazing resulted in a decrease in single-celled bacteria and an increase in filamentous bacteria. During the second experiment, characterized by dominance of Cyclops vicinus, strong alterations in the microbial food web structure occurred. The most obvious effects were an efficient predation control of planktonic ciliates by copepods and a shift of the picoplankton towards filamentous bacteria and a very high biomass of pAPP, which we interpret as a result of enhanced protozoan grazing pressure on bacterioplankton. After the peak in cyclopoids, Daphnia spp. became the dominant zooplankton taxa which resulted in the well known strong predation effects on all microbial components. The two experiments confirm that metazooplankton species composition is an important structuring factor for the microbial food web. Two functional groups deserve special attention: filamentous bacteria and pAPP. Filamentous bacteria, which attained nearly 50% of total heterotrophic bacterial biomass during the second period, seem to be a sensitive indicator of the overall planktonic food web structure and showed significant responses in the enclosures. With a special staining procedure, we analysed the abundance of filamentous bacteria in Lugol-fixed samples collected since 1984 during periods when either daphnids, cyclopoids or rotifers dominated the metazooplankton community. On average, high abundance of filaments was always associated with Cyclops-dominated situations, low numbers with Daphnia dominance and high, but rather variable numbers with rotifer dominance. A general close correlation of pAPP with filamentous bacteria might indicate that pAPP also possess a reduced edibility for protozoans.					; Jeppesen, Erik/O-2667-2019; Jeppesen, Erik/A-4463-2012	Jurgens, Klaus/0000-0002-7999-9368; Jeppesen, Erik/0000-0002-0542-369X													0142-7873	1464-3774				JUN	2000	22	6					1047	1070		10.1093/plankt/22.6.1047	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/22.6.1047													WOS:000087629500003
J	Piper, JDA				Piper, JDA			Palaeomagnetism of igneous rocks of the Lake District (Caledonian) terrane, northern England: Palaeozoic motions and deformation at a leading edge of Avalonia	GEOLOGICAL JOURNAL												The Lake District terrane of northern England comprises Upper Cambrian-Silurian sediments and volcanics accumulated at the northern margin of the Avalonian Plate during growth and demise of the Iapetus Ocean. Ocean closure and suturing resulted in Late Ordovician and Acadian tectonism and were accompanied by emplacement of a large regional batholith. Palaeomagnetic study of intrusive igneous rocks, including application of thermal demagnetization, field tests and principal component analysis, identifies a history of Ordovician to Devonian magnetization. Late plutons (Shap and Skiddaw granites and/or aureoles) record a shallow dipolar (A3) axis (mean declination/inclination (D/I = 278/+17 degrees) dating from emplacement in late Early Devonian times (c. 395 Ma). Although this axis is recorded as a sporadic overprint in older rocks, no pervasive remagnetization is attributable to batholith emplacement. Instead, the Carrock Fell Complex Layered Gabbros have a mid-to late Ordovician (A1) remanence (D/I) = 17.4/-58.1 degrees, 36 samples, alpha(95) = 4.8 degrees) predating regional F2 folding. Later events in this igneous complex comprise the Carrock Fell Granophyre with a post-folding Ordovician remanence, and Round Knott Dolerite with a remanence linked to hydrothermal alteration late in the Ordovician magmatic episode. A Late Ordovician (Ashgill) palaeofield is also defined by remanence (A2) in the Threlkeld-St John's Microgranite and aureole (438 Ma, D/I = 236.5/63.3 degrees, 41 samples, alpha(95) = 4.7 degrees). Other intrusions carrying a remanence predating the Acadian deformation include the Great Cockup Picrite (458 Ma, D/I = 43.2/-31.8 degrees, 31 samples, alpha(95) = 7.7 degrees) and basic intrusives in the aureole of the Eskdale Granite (429 Ma, D/I = 174.5/25.8 degrees, 32 samples, alpha(95) = 8.8 degrees). Collectively the palaeomagnetic data from this terrane identify a hairpin in the apparent polar wander path during Late Ordovician (Caradoc-Ashgill) times corresponding to 'soft' closure of the Iapetus suture and accompanying deformation. The same motion is recognized in contemporaneous data from the Welsh Caledonides where declinations are rotated by c. 55 degrees relative to contemporaneous results from the Lake District. Adjustment for this (probable late Acadian) rotation beings fold trends of the Paratectonic Caledonides into alignment and identifies a parallel mid- to late Ordovician destructive plate margin comprising forearc (Lake District) and backarc (North Wales). This are was oriented latitudinally in mid-southerly latitudes during formation and the bulk of the magmatism occurred during a single normal-polarity chron. The relationships between magnetization and folding in both the Lake District and Welsh Borderlands identify the importance of Late Ordovician deformation along this are during collision of Avalonia and Laurentia. Are-related volcanism was succeeded in Silurian times by parallel foreland basins embracing the Welsh Basin and southern Lake District as the Laurentian Plate overrode the Avalonian Plate.

Aquatic organisms are highly elusive, and once established, eradicating them becomes a challenging task. Currently, our understanding of the invasion risk posed by non-native aquatic species in Shanghai is limited. Therefore, it is imperative to investigate the pathways of introduction, distribution, and dispersion and the invasion risk and impacts of non-native aquatic organisms in Shanghai. This study investigated aquatic organisms in Shanghai's primary water bodies, including Huangpu River, Suzhou River, and Dianshan Lake. The risk assessment was conducted using the Aquatic Species Invasiveness Screening Kit (AS-ISK), and field monitoring was performed with environmental DNA (eDNA) technology. Results of the risk assessment indicate that among the 21 evaluated species, 9 fall into the medium-to-high-risk category with scores >= 26, while 12 are classified as low-risk with scores <26. The top four species with the highest invasion risk are Gambusia affinis, Pomacea canaliculata, Lepomis macrochirus, and Coptodon zillii. This study identified 54 fish species belonging to seven orders, 16 families, and 42 genera at 16 sampling sites in Shanghai, among which Channa maculata, Micropterus salmoides, and Misgurnus bipartitus are non-native. The results suggest that Shanghai faces a high invasion risk of aquatic species, necessitating enhanced scientific prevention and control measures. Early monitoring is essential for species with medium-to-high invasion risk, and a further evaluation and analysis of the risks associated with introduced fish species already present in Shanghai are recommended for aquaculture practices.					; Wu, Qianqian/AIE-3397-2022; Fan, Li/AAE-8815-2021; Wink, Michael/E-3803-2012; Zhan, Aibin/A-7240-2011	Zhan, Aibin/0000-0003-1416-1238; Zhou, Jinxin/0000-0002-1806-944X; Wu, Qianqian/0000-0002-8402-4055; 														1424-2818				JAN	2024	16	1							29	10.3390/d16010029	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d16010029													WOS:001151772100001

Temporal trends and determinants of fish biomass in two contrasting natural lake systems: insights from a spring long-term monitoring scheme	KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS												Freshwater fish declines are triggered by a suite of anthropogenic threats, including habitat degradation, climate and land use change, biological invasions, pollution and overfishing. Robust monitoring schemes are needed to understand and detect any effects of different factors on freshwater fish abundance and to be able to predict and respond to potential stressors. Here, we used standardized biomass-per-unit-effort (BPUE) data deriving from gillnet sampling over a 34-year period in the two Prespa Lakes and determined species trends using general additive models coupled with structural change models. Furthermore, the influence of seven environmental variables was assessed for each fish species using an analytical approach based on random forests. We showed that the total annual BPUE is increasing in Lake Mikri Prespa whereas it is stable in Megali Prespa and that the relative BPUE of introduced species in the former is increasing through the years. Differences in the lakes' trophic status were reflected in species trend patterns. Random forests showed that air temperature, the introduction of the invasive Lepomis gibbosus, predation and water management played a role in shaping species biomass in Mikri Prespa whereas abiotic factors are the main drivers of biomass changes in Megali Prespa. Our results provide empirical evidence on the importance of long-term monitoring in distinguishing between direct and indirect effects of large-scale stressors on fish abundance as well as insights towards sustaining the integrity of fish communities.

J	Kurmayer, R; Christiansen, G; Chorus, I				Kurmayer, R; Christiansen, G; Chorus, I			The abundance of microcystin-producing genotypes correlates positively with colony size in Microcystis sp and determines its microcystin net production in Lake Wannsee	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												The working hypotheses tested on a natural population of Microcystis sp. in Lake Wannsee (Berlin, Germany) were that (i) the varying abundance of microcystin-producing genotypes versus non-microcystin-producing genotypes is a key factor for microcystin net production and (ii) the occurrence of a gene for microcystin net production is related to colony morphology, particularly colony size. To test these hypotheses, samples were fractionated by colony size with a sieving procedure during the summer of 2000. Each colony size class was analyzed for cell numbers, the proportion of microcystin-producing genotypes, and microcystin concentrations. The smallest size class of Microcystis colonies (<50 mum) showed the lowest proportion of microcystin-producing genotypes, the highest proportion of non-microcystin-producing cells, and the lowest microcystin cell quotas (sum of microcystins RR, YR, LR, and WR). In contrast, the larger size classes of Microcystis colonies (>100 mum) showed the highest proportion of microcystin-producing genotypes, the lowest proportion of non-microcystin-producing cells, and the highest microcystin cell quotas. The microcystin net production rate was nearly one to one positively related to the population growth rate for the larger colony size classes (>100 mum); however, no relationship could be found for the smaller size classes. It was concluded that the variations found in microcystin net production between colony size classes are chiefly due to diferences in genotype composition and that the microcystin net production in the lake is mainly influenced by the abundance of the larger (>100-mum) microcystin-producing colonies.

In this study, the distribution and source of PAEs in the surface water of Xingkai Lake, China were analyzed. The concentration of Sigma PAEs in the water of Xingkai Lake ranged from 0.26 to 3.83 mu g/L, with a median of 1.28 mu g/L. It was observed that the difference in the concentration of Sigma PAEs between the small and large Xingkai Lakes is not significant (p > 0.05). Agriculturally dominated land use types in the Xingkai Lake watershed may be mainly responsible for the occurrence of PAEs in this Lake. The distribution of butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP) in small and large Xingkai Lakes showed a significant difference (p < 0.05) which may be related to anthropogenic activities. Sigma PAEs in the water of Xingkai Lake demon-strated significant positive correlations with the ratio of total nitrogen (TN) to concentration of TP (r(p) = 0.697, p < 0.01) and the concentration of suspended particulate organic matter (SPOM) (r(p) = 0.345, p < 0.05). These results further indicate that the concentration of nutrients from agricultural activity had an impact on the concentrations of PAE in the lakes. Furthermore, the more SPOM would lead to more suspension of PAEs in the water phase. The source analysis of PAEs showed that high molecular weight PAEs were dominant in the Xingkai Lake which may be arising from the combustion of plastics or from building materials and household furnishing.

J	SLIM, PA; OOSTERVELD, P				SLIM, PA; OOSTERVELD, P			VEGETATION DEVELOPMENT ON NEWLY EMBANKED SANDFLATS IN THE GREVELINGEN (THE NETHERLANDS) UNDER DIFFERENT MANAGEMENT-PRACTICES	VEGETATIO												In 1971 the Grevelingen estuary was embanked. In the newly created lake Grevelingen, the tidal movements stopped and a few thousand ha of sandflats fell permanently dry, .apprx. 40% of the surface of those flats was immediately afterwards sown with rye and other grasses to prevent wind erosion. This fixation of a rather uniform environment resulted in a monotonous vegetation cover. Grazing with domestic animals [ponies and sheep] is now applied as management practice to create more environmental variation and thereby a higher species diversity. The present study gives the results of 11 yr of comparing vegetation development under various management practices, including non-interference in the spontaneous and sown vegetation. Sequential vegetation mapping, repeated inventories of selected areas and studies in permanent plots are the main techniques used. On the unsown shore zones interesting vegetation types are developing where species diversity is higher than in the sown areas. In the shore zones not only did a faster succession occur compared with the sown areas, but also a shifting of environmental gradients, e.g., in moisture and salinity conditions, encouraged vegetation changes. After 10 yr grazed areas had a higher number of species than ungrazed equivalent areas. The results also indicated that grazing slows down the establishment of (tall) woody species and shrub development.																			0042-3106						1985	62	1-3					407	414		10.1007/BF00044768	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00044768													WOS:A1985ALW9900016

Two hundred years later, people abandoned the Taino settlement, and relocated to new settlements at Yuri and Kitadera, south of Shiiyama Hill. This study uses pollen analysis of an MK91 core from Lake Mikata and climate reconstruction through the modern analogue method using Polygon 2.4.4 software to understand the environmental conditions at the times these settlements were abandoned. The sediment from 356 cm to 458 cm, corresponding to 7300 cal. bp to ca. 5100 cal. bp, was analysed. The vegetation was dominated by Cryptomeria japonica (Japanese cedar) throughout the period. When the landslide occurred ca. 5800 cal. bp, precipitation and the risk of landslides were high. Taino, located on a gentle slope, was less vulnerable to landslide than Torihama. In the sediment covering the period after ca. 5600 cal. bp, the percentages of Cryptomeria pollen and the pollen flux of all pollen taxa decrease. Precipitation was lower, and the annual mean temperature at that time dropped to under 10 degrees C. The cold, dry climate led to the abandonment of the Taino settlement, with its strong winter north winds, and the relocation of the settlement to the warmer south side of Shiiyama Hill.

J	Jackson, LJ				Jackson, LJ			Macrophyte-dominated and turbid states of shallow lakes: Evidence from Alberta Lakes	ECOSYSTEMS												Ecosystems may exist in more than one state. This provocative ecological theory was initially developed and addressed largely through modeling studies, but over the last 2 decades a number of diverse ecosystems have been shown to display alternate states. Here I present data from 30 lakes located in a relatively limited geographic region (Alberta, Canada) to seek evidence for alternate states in shallow prairie lakes. The lakes that I surveyed fell into the following three clusters based on their turbidity and maximum depth: (a) deep, relatively clear dimictic lakes, (b) shallow clear polymictic lakes, and (c) shallow turbid polymictic lakes. The shallow lakes had similar proportions of lake bottom supporting the growth of rooted submerged macrophytes, yet the macrophyte biomass was approximately five times higher in shallow clear lakes than in shallow turbid lakes. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) revealed that there was a significantly higher concentration of chlorophyll per unit of dissolved phosphorus in shallow lakes classified as turbid compared to those classified as clear. A separate ANCOVA also showed that the higher turbidity in the turbid lakes was not due simply to higher chlorophylla(a) concentrations; rather, it appears that increased sediment resuspension is the source of the higher turbidity seen in these lakes. Food web effects appear to be small. Although these shallow Alberta lakes contain no benthic fishes, as do many European lakes that have been observed over time, the general patterns are consistent with the theory that alternate states can exist in shallow lakes.																			1432-9840	1435-0629				APR	2003	6	3					213	223		10.1007/s10021-002-0001-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-002-0001-3													WOS:000183001600002

Diets of the benthic amphipod Diporeia in southern Lake Michigan before and after the dreissenid invasion	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Diporeia spp. were a key component of the Great Lakes benthos, converting the pelagic algal rain to secondary production, which is critical for Great Lakes fishes. However, Diporeia declines since the 1980s have been rapid and widespread. While there are temporal relationships between Diporeia declines and spread of zebra and quagga mussels, establishing a mechanistic link has been difficult. Diporeia declines may result from competition for food resources with dreissenid mussels; however, conflicting evidence suggests food limitation may not be the direct link. To test food limitation, we analyzed gut contents of Diporeia collected between the 1980s and 2009 from two deep (>100 m) and one nearshore station (similar to 50 m depth) in southern Lake Michigan. We further analyzed sediment cores from the same stations to resolve relationships among food resources, Diporeia diet, and diet selectivity during pre- and post-dreissenid invasion. In spring, pre-dreissenid Diporeia fed selectively and exclusively on large (Stephanodiscus) and filamentous centric diatoms (Aulacoseira). Diporeia diets showed significant shifts during the 2000s to greater proportions of small centric and araphid diatoms, coincident with Diporeia declines and offshore expansion of quagga mussels. Sediment cores recorded declines in Aulacoseira and large Stephanodiscus from 1960 to 2009 and increases in small centrics after dreissenid introduction. Accounting for high selectivity in springtime Diporeia diets, community changes in sediment records are consistent with changes observed in Diporeia diets and suggest Diporeia declines have been exacerbated by a shift from more nutritious and highly preferred diatom species to less nutritious and negatively selected species.

Temperature and food availability were the main factors controlling the sudden increase in abundance, which reached a maximum of 101 cell ml-1 at the beginning of summer. During their exponential development in numbers and biomass, a strong decrease in chlorophyll a and in the abundance of phytoplankton, especially Rhodomonas, was observed. We assume, therefore, that Pseudobalanion planctonicum and Urotricha furcata together with rotifers, mainly Polyarthra dolichoptera, are able to reduce the phytoplankton biomass in the upper epilimnion to the same level as found during the clear-water phase. Preliminary results of grazing on bacteria suggest that these nanociliates are omnivorous, although their impact on bacterial assemblages was low (3.1 % of the standing stock grazed per day). Feeding on the base of the food web combined with their high abudance at certain times makes them an important link for higher trophic levels.

Evidence that skin suits affect long track speed skating performance	ENGINEERING OF SPORT CONFERENCE 2012	Procedia Engineering				9th Conference of the International-Sports-Engineering-Association (ISEA)	JUL 09-13, 2012	Univ Massachusetts Lowell, Lowell, MA	Int Sports Engn Assoc (ISEA)	Univ Massachusetts Lowell			Wind tunnel measurements of the aerodynamic drag (F-d) of competitive speed skating suits were compared to the Olympic race results of athletes who wore these suits in three consecutive Winter Olympic games. A novel, multi-fabric speed skating race suit (SWIFTSkin) that was designed to reduce the Fd of long track skaters was first introduced at the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics. This suit provided a 10.1% reduction in Fd over previous suits. Skaters from two countries wore the SWIFTSkin suit and won 16 of a possible 30 medals while setting 8 world records. On average, the Olympic performance of 59 skaters in the SWIFTSkin suit exceeded their previous personal best performance by 1.03%. A similar performance analysis of skaters from other nations clad in single fabric speed suits exhibited minor differences between pre-Olympic and Olympic performances. For subsequent Olympic games, the SWIFTSkin was worn by skaters from up to six nations while skaters competing for other nations wore suits that were designed with similar features. At the 2006 Torino and 2010 Vancouver Olympics, the difference in pre-Olympic to Olympic performance based on type of suit worn diminished for all skaters. The aerodynamic benefits of the SWIFTSkin measured in a wind tunnel coupled with the initial step change in performance noted with the introduction of the SWIFTSkin into competition and the reduction in the advantage provided by this apparel as its design features were assimilated into general Speed Skating competitive apparel provide observational evidence that apparel can impact elite sport performance.

A long-term study of catchment inputs of 137Cs to a subalpine lake in the form of allochthonous terrestrial plant material	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The input of allochthonous plant material, largely terrestrial in origin, during the spring spate is a major source of primary production for montane lake ecosystems such as vre Heimdalsvatn and is readily incorporated into the food chain leading to fish. The transport from the lake catchment of allochthonous plant material contaminated with Chernobyl Cs-137 in 1986 was investigated from 1989 to 2008. Cs-137 activity concentrations were determined for both total samples before sorting and for the separate components in the two main tributary streams, Brurskardbekken and Lektorbekken, as well as the outflow river, Hinogla. The total samples showed a similar long-term decline at all sites, although Cs-137 activity concentrations were generally somewhat higher in Hinogla compared to the tributary streams. For the total samples, ecological half-lives were in the region of 4-5 years. However, there were major differences between components. The Cs-137 activity content of most components, including mosses, leaves of willow and woody material, decreased significantly over time. Lichens and juniper declined, but the relationship was not significant, while leaves of mountain birch and dwarf birch showed no obvious trend over the 20-year period.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR	2010	642	1					101	106		10.1007/s10750-010-0163-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-010-0163-5													WOS:000275782400010
J	AUCLAIR, JC				AUCLAIR, JC			IMPLICATIONS OF INCREASED UV-B INDUCED PHOTOREDUCTION - IRON(II) ENRICHMENT STIMULATES PICOCYANOBACTERIAL GROWTH AND THE MICROBIAL FOOD-WEB IN CLEAR-WATER ACIDIC CANADIAN SHIELD LAKES	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Ozone depletion and associated increases in UV-B radiation could increase the photoreduction of iron in Canadian Shield lakes of the boreal forest zone. Since photoreduced iron(II) is more soluble than iron(III), and the reoxidation rate slower in acidic (pH = 5-6) lakes, phytoplanktonic growth and(or) species composition may be altered where iron is growth limiting. This hypothesis was tested by amending herbivore-free lake-water enclosures with phosphorus, phosphorus and iron(II), or phosphorus, ammonium, and iron(II) in lac Tantare, a clear-water acidic lake in Quebec. In herbivore-free unenriched control enclosures, phytoplanktonic abundance doubled within 48 h, demonstrating unequivocally that herbivore grazing (top-down control) intensity controls phytoplanktonic abundance in early spring in this lake. However, at chlorophyll a concentrations 2-3 times the ambient lake levels, picocyanobacterial production and abundance were greater in the phosphorus and iron enclosures, relative to the phosphorus-only enclosures. This resulted in enhanced growth of the indigenous chrysophytes presumably through increased mixotrophy. In spite of a 10-fold increase in nanoflagellate abundance, we were unable to discern any strong competitive interactions among the mixotrophic chrysophytes. This strongly suggests that most if not all of their iron quotas are obtained from their picoplanktonic prey.																			0706-652X					AUG	1995	52	8					1782	1788		10.1139/f95-770	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f95-770													WOS:A1995TE92400018

Three distinctive pollution plume types were identified: haze aerosols impacted by biomass combustion, nanoparticle bursts associated with outflow from Beijing, and saline soil particles from salt deposits. The highest PM1.0 concentration was observed in a fall haze event, under near-stagnant high-pressure synoptic conditions that were characterized by the lowest visibility (< 5 km) and the highest K+ and OC concentrations, indicating the influence of biomass combustion. When strong high-pressure systems develop in China, they efficiently export fresh urban emissions from Beijing to the study region, as distinguished by nanoparticle bursts of > 10(4) cm(-3) with highly elevated SO2 levels, even during the night. When air masses move rapidly from northeastern China to Gosan under strong wind conditions, the Ca2+ concentration, along with that of Cl- and Na+, is enhanced in PM1.0, which is attributed to the influence of saline transport from dry lakes. The results of this study reveal compositional details and information on both number and mass concentration for different PM1.0 plumes from anthropogenic and natural sources, all of which are associated with different kinds of Chinese outflow events.

Samples were taken from two lakes occurring in two different climatic systems: Lake Aydat (France) and Lake Cromwell (Canada). The study was done in summer, using 24-hour cycles of sampling. Due to their large size, the specific volume of filamentous bacteria constituted, on average, the major part (> 70%) of the total specific volume of all bacterial forms considered. Greatest variations in specific biovolumes were recorded for filamentous bacteria (coefficients of variation ranged from 16 to 109%). These variations were more pronounced in the oxygenated and microaerophilic strata (DOC approximately 1.5 mg liter-1). Fluctuations in cell volume were high (coefficients of variation = 12-80%) for coccal bacteria, whereas no marked fluctuations were found for the rod and vibrio bacteria (coefficients of variation = 4-10%). Evidence of diel patterns of cell volume of filmentous bacteria is provided. These cells displayed their maximum size during the day until early early night, indicating cell division was occurring at night. Homogeneous circadian patterns were not provided by specific volume variations of coccal, rod, and vibrio bacteria. Statistical relationships between bacterial specific biovolumes and the biotic and abiotic parameters considered are discussed.

Multiple model simulations using various wetland extent datasets and climate change scenarios were conducted to assess the uncertainty of CH4 fluxes, including emissions and consumption. On the basis of these simulations we estimate the current net emissions in the region to be 20-24 Tg CH4 yr(-1) (1 Tg = 10(12) g), two-thirds of which are emitted during the summer. In response to climate change over the 21st century, the annual CH4 emissions in the region are projected to increase at a rate of 0.06 Tg CH4 yr(-1), which is an order of magnitude greater than that of annual CH4 consumption. Further, the annual net CH4 emissions are projected to increase by 6-51% under various wetland extent datasets and climate scenarios by the end of the 21st century, relative to present conditions. Spatial patterns of net CH4 emissions were determined by wetland extent. Net CH4 emissions were dominated by wetlands within boreal forests, grasslands and wet tundra areas in the region. Correlation analyses indicated that water table depth and soil temperature were the two most important environmental controls on both CH4 emissions and consumption in the region. Our uncertainty analyses indicated that the uncertainty in wetland extent had a larger effect on future CH4 emissions than the uncertainty in future climate. This study suggests that better characterization of the spatial distribution and the natural diversity of wetlands should be a research priority for quantifying CH4 fluxes in this region.

Tracing Holocene temperatures and human impact in a Greenlandic Lake: Novel insights from hyperspectral imaging and lipid biomarkers	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Global warming particularly impacts terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in the Arctic. To constrain the sensitivity of Arctic lakes and make meaningful predictions about future change under global warming, we need to examine their response to previous warm phases. Lake sediments from Greenland's deglaciated area offer valuable archives to investigate past climate variability and associated lake changes. Here, we applied hyperspectral imaging and lipid biomarker thermometry to a Holocene-length sediment record from Lake 578 in the Eastern Settlement of the Norse (61.08(degrees) N, 45.62(degrees) W; similar to 155 m a.s.l) to investigate local temperature, productivity, and anoxia histories. We calibrated branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) with summer mean water temperatures (SMWT) using a previously published site-specific calibration and analyzed pigment fluxes based on hyperspectral imaging. Notably, the anoxia reconstructions were corroborated with two independent proxies (GDGT-0/Crenarchaeol and bacterio pheophytins). We investigated the lake's environmental history and identified periods of significant change by employing generalized additive models (GAMs). Our results reveal significant transitions in Lake 578 driven both by natural climate shifts and anthropogenic impacts. During the early Holocene, low SMWT and productivity coupled with high anoxia suggest strong seasonality and prolonged inverted thermal stratification, possibly enhanced by extended ice cover. The midHolocene showed higher SMWT and productivity along with low anoxia, indicating a dimictic lake system. The early Holocene temperature rise lagged that of to the Northern Hemisphere, but closely followed the Atlantic-Fennoscandian stack. The Holocene Thermal Maximum (7.5-4.5 cal ka BP) aligns with other regional reconstructions. After 3 cal ka BP, we observed a Neoglacial cooling characterized by increased anoxia and reduced temperatures due to enhanced stratification. At around 1.0 cal ka BP, Lake 578 saw a surge in productivity and anoxia, which we attribute to land use and lake damming by the Norse. Despite a post-Norse decline in productivity and disappearance of anoxia, the lake never reverted to its pre-Norse state, with modern sheep farming further intensifying productivity in recent decades. While early Holocene anoxia resulted from natural cold temperature stratification, anoxia during the Norse period was anthropogenically induced. This research underscores the value of integrating lipid biomarkers with hyperspectral imaging for detailed reconstructions of changes within Arctic lakes. It provides crucial insights for anticipating the ecologic and climatic resilience of Arctic lakes to ongoing global warming and anthropogenic influence.

The aim of this research is to improve a record of diplozoid species occurrence in C. aydinensis, an endemic fish species by collecting data from a previously unexplored locality situated in a different geographical region of Turkiye. A total of 187 individuals of C. aydinensis were collected by using fishing nets from October 2019 to July 2020 and examined for the presence of diplozoid species. Only one species of diplozoid has been recorded, known as Paradiplozoon bliccae (Reichenbach-Klinke, 1961), which has been identified morphologically and confirmed through molecular analysis. The nucleotide sequences of the parasite's nuclear internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) gene marker were determined as well as phylogenetic analyses by using Bayesian inference (BI) analyses. On the basis of the molecular findings, the morphological identification of the diplozoid parasite species was confirmed. Of 187 fish sampled, 27 were infected with 117 P. bliccae, representing an abundance of 0.6, a mean intensity of 4.3 and a prevalence of 14.4%. The prevalence and mean intensity of infection were based on the season and sex of the host. The highest values of infection for prevalence, mean intensity and abundance were found in summer. Meanwhile, mean intensity and abundance of P. bliccae were higher in males, the prevalence was higher in females. To our knowledge, the present study is the first ichthyoparasitological study of C. aydinensis in Koycegiz lake, near the province of Mugla in Turkiye. Furthermore, sequence data of P. bliccae from fish hosts in this locality were reported to GenBank for the first time as part of this study. Therefore, this study widens the host range of this parasite species in Turkiye.

J	Samuel, MD; Shadduck, DJ; Goldberg, DR; Johnson, WP				Samuel, MD; Shadduck, DJ; Goldberg, DR; Johnson, WP			Avian cholera in waterfowl: The role of lesser snow and Ross's geese as disease carriers in the Playa Lakes Region	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES												We collected samples from apparently healthy geese in the Playa Lakes Region (USA) during the winters of 2000-01 and 2001-02 to determine whether carriers of Pasteurella multocida, the bacterium that causes avian cholera, were present in wild populations. With the use of methods developed in laboratory challenge trials (Samuel et A, 2003a) and a serotypespecific polymerase chain reaction method for identification of P. multocida serotype 1, we found that a small proportion of 322 wild birds (< 5%) were carriers of pathogenic R multocida. On the basis of serology, an additional group of these birds (< 10%) were survivors of recent avian cholera infection. Our results confirm the hypothesis that wild waterfowl are carriers of avian cholera and add support for the hypothesis that wild birds are a reservoir for this disease. In concert with other research, this work indicates that enzootic infection with avian cholera occurs in lesser snow goose (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) populations throughout their annual cycle. Although fewer Ross's geese (Chen rossii) were sampled, we also found these birds were carriers of P multocida. Even in the absence of disease outbreaks, serologic evidence indicates that chronic disease transmission and recent infection are apparently occurring year-round in these highly gregarious birds and that a small portion of these populations are potential carriers with active infection.

In this study, hydrogeochemical and isotope methods were employed to determine regional and local hydrogeology and characteristics of the basin. Optical, thermal and radar remote sensing products were used to update geological and structural maps of the basin and determine sampling points using the judgment sampling method. A total of 363 samples from wells, springs, rivers, lakes, swamps and rain were collected for this study, and an additional 270 water quality data sets were added from previous studies. These data were analyzed for their hydrogeochemical characteristics and isotope signatures. Analysis of the oxygen, deuterium and tritium isotopes shows the groundwater of the basin is modern water. Among all basins in Ethiopia, the Baro-Akobo Basin shows the highest enrichment. This indicates the proximity of the rainfall sources, which presumably are the Sudd and other wetlands in South Sudan. The hydrochemical properties of the waters show evapotranspiration is the dominant hydrologic process in the basin and explains the large amount of water that is lost in the lowland plain. Analysis of radon-222 shows no significant groundwater flux over the wetlands, which are part of Machar Marshes. This shows evaporation to be dominant hydrologic process in this zone. Results from all analyses help explain the limited holding capacity of the aquifers in the recharge zone and their vulnerability to anthropogenic impacts and climate variability. There is a trend of decreasing surface flow and rainfall and increasing water soil erosion.

Samples of freshwater Ulva were collected from two aqueous ecosystems lie 250 km away from the basin of the Baltic Sea and 53 km from each other. A flow lake located in the centre of the big city was the first water reservoir (ten sites) and second, the suburban river (six sites). The mean metal concentrations in the Ulva tissue from the river and the lake decreased in the following order: Mn > Zn > Cr > Cu > Co and Mn > Cr > Zn > Cu > Co, respectively. Moreover, a negative and statistically significant correlation between Mn concentrations in the Ulva thalli and the river water was observed. Additionally, numerous correlations were noted between the different concentrations of metals within the Ulva thalli, in the water and in the sediment. The great concentrations of Mn and Zn and the smallest of Co were found in thalli of Ulva, irrespective of the type of the ecosystem from which samples of algal thalli originated. Freshwater Ulva populations examined in this study were clearly characterized a dozen or so times by the higher Mn and Cr accumulation than taxa from that genera coming from sea ecosystems. The calculated bioconcentration factor confirm the high potential for freshwater Ulva to be a bioaccumulator of trace metals in freshwater ecosystems.					; Rybak, Andrzej/J-2865-2012	Messyasz, Beata/0000-0002-4371-3591; Rybak, Andrzej/0000-0001-7755-857X; Leska, Boguslawa/0000-0002-9504-5265													0963-9292	1573-3017				APR	2013	22	3					558	573		10.1007/s10646-013-1048-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-013-1048-y								23400796					WOS:000316281300012
J	Kostic, S; Parker, G				Kostic, S; Parker, G			Progradational sand-mud deltas in lakes and reservoirs. Part 2. Experiment and numerical simulation	JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC RESEARCH												Rivers deposit deltas wherever they reach standing water, i.e. a lake or reservoir. Here the case of a sand-bed river carrying mud as wash load is considered. In general the sand tends to deposit out to form a fluvial topset and an avalanching foreset, and the mud tends to deposit out as a bottomset. During floods, many sand-bed rivers carry sufficiently high concentrations of washload to render the river water heavier than that of the body of standing water. In such a case the mud-laden river fow plunges to form a bottom turbidity current. In a companion paper a I-D numerical model of a prograding delta was presented. In this model fluvial, avalanching and turbidity current deposition are all linked in terms of a moving boundary formulation. Here the model is compared against two experiments on delta progradation. The experiments reveal an intriguing interaction between the three elements of the model, with foreset progradation burying the bottomset and pushing its upstream point ever downstream, and with bottomset deposition raising the toe of the foreset, so increasing the rate of foreset progradation as sand is delivered from the topset. The numerical model of the companion paper captures this interaction with a minimum of adjustment of input parameters. The resulting description of delta morphodynamics is very similar to that observed in e.g. the delta in the Colorado River, USA where it reaches Lake Mead.																			0022-1686						2003	41	2					141	152		10.1080/00221680309499957	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00221680309499957													WOS:000182936600003

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC AND EVOLUTIONARY MICROBIOLOGY												A Gram-staining-positive, facultatively anaerobic, non-motile and moderately halophilic actinobacterium, designated YIM 93306(T), was isolated from a salt lake in Xinjiang province, northwest China, and subjected to a polyphasic taxonomic study. Strain YIM 93306(T) grew in the presence of 2-16% (w/v) NaCl and did not grow without NaCl. The peptidoglycan type was A4 alpha with an L-Lys-L-Glu interpeptide bridge. The whole-cell sugars were glucosamine, arabinose, mannose and two unknown sugars. The predominant menaquinone was MK-8(H-4). The major fatty acids were iso-C-15:0 anteiso-C-15:0 and anteiso-C-17:0. The polar lipids comprised diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, one unknown phosphoglycolipid and one unknown phospholipid. The DNA G + C content was 68.3 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain YIM 93306(T) fell within the radius of the suborder Micrococcineae. Its closest phylogenetic neighbour was the type strain of Ruania albidiflava (AS 4.3142(T); 96.2% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity), the sole recognized species of the genus Ruania. Sequence similarities between strain YIM 93306(T) and members of other genera of the suborder Micrococcineae were <95.2 %.

J	Majoran, S				Majoran, S			Palaeoenvironmental indications of a Late Weichselian ostracod assemblage from the southern Kattegat, Scandinavia	GFF												Vibrocore 9303 was drilled at a water depth of 35 m in the southern Kattegat and penetrated 10 m of Holocene and Late Weichselian sediments. The ostracods recorded from 11 samples of this core in the time between c. 11,500 and 10,500 BP are dominated by Elofsonella concinna, Sarsicytheridea punctillata, Cytheropteron dimlingtonensis, Roundstonia globulifera, Acanthocythereis dunelmensis, Sarsicytheridea bradii, Cytheropteron macchesneyi, Robertsonites tuberculatus, freshwater spp., and Heterocyprideis sorbyana. Most of these species are autochthonous (not freshwater spp.) based on their population age structures. The maximum bottom-water temperature probably ranged from 8 to 12 degrees C during summer. The palaeoenvironment was probably marine sublittoral with depths exceeding 10-15 m. The time interval between c. 10,900 and 10,650 BP is marked by (1) an increase in ostracod species diversity, (2) a decrease in dominance of the three most abundant ostracod species, (3) a replacement of A. dunelmensis by C. macchesneyi and (4) freshwater species become more abundant. These changes may possibly be due to an increased niche availability and/or sea-level changes associated with a stronger influence of freshwater to the in situ environment. However, the changes in species composition are statistically insignificant according to a bootstrap correspondence analysis.																			1103-5897					SEP	1999	121		3				215	220		10.1080/11035899901213215	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11035899901213215													WOS:000083427800012

A total of 18 and 21 chironomid taxa were identified in 290- and 252-cm-long sediment sequences from Duck Lake and Hjort Lake, respectively. The chironomid assemblages were very similar in the two lakes. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to compare fossil chironomid assemblages from Store Koldewey with chironomid assemblages and environmental conditions presently found in Canadian Arctic lakes and, hence, to infer environmental changes for Northeast Greenland. The first chironomids appeared at c. 9500 cal. a BP in Hjort Lake, and 500 years later in Duck Lake. Taxa typical for cold and nutrient-poor arctic lakes dominated the earliest assemblages. Chironomid assemblages with taxa typical of higher summer air temperatures and lakes with higher nutrient availability occur between 8000 and 5000 cal. a BP. This period probably marks the regional Holocene thermal maximum, which is relatively late compared with some palaeoenvironmental records from East Greenland. One possible reason could be the location of Store Koldewey at the very outer coast, with local climatic conditions strongly influenced by the cold East Greenland Current. From around 5000 cal. a BP, chironomid assemblages in Duck Lake and Hjort Lake again became more typical of those presently found in Northeast Greenland, indicating relatively cold and nutrient-poor conditions. This shift coincides with an increase of ice-rafting debris off East Greenland and an intensification of the East Greenland Current.					; Bennike, Ole/G-7070-2018; Heiri, Oliver/JCE-4598-2023; Melles, Martin/J-4070-2012; Wagner, Bernd/J-4682-2012	Wagner, Bernd/0000-0002-1369-7893; Bennike, Ole/0000-0002-5486-9946; Melles, Martin/0000-0003-0977-9463; Heiri, Oliver/0000-0002-3957-5835													0300-9483	1502-3885					2011	40	1					116	130		10.1111/j.1502-3885.2010.00173.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1502-3885.2010.00173.x													WOS:000285752900009

The concentrations of iron in these geogenic acidified lakes are orders of magnitude higher than in acidic bog lakes and softwater lakes acidified by atmospheric deposition. For the most part ferric iron was the predominant species by a Fe(III) to Fe(II) ratio of more than 10. Density stratification of the water column leads to vertical concentration gradients of ferrous iron. Extremely high concentrations of ferrous iron were found in the anoxic layers above the sediment of ML 111 and ML 107. High concentrations of Fe(II) were correlated with high concentrations of carbon dioxide. A microbial potential to reduce ferric iron was found in the sediments. In ML 111 and ML 117 the concentrations of Fe(II) in the epilimnion were markedly higher than in the oxic hypolimnetic layers. It can be suggested that the occurence of ferrous iron in the epilimnion is of photochemical origin, as described for softwater lakes. Minimum concentrations of dissolved organic carbon in the epilimnion could be correlated to the increase of ferrous iron concentrations. Especially in springtime and summer the concentrations of Fe(II) in the epilimnion were higher than in the oxic hypolimnetic layer below.					; Friese, Kurt/E-1395-2012; Wendt-Potthoff, Katrin/E-1708-2016	Herzsprung, Peter/0000-0001-5872-443X; Friese, Kurt/0000-0002-7769-0818; Wendt-Potthoff, Katrin/0000-0002-7407-3312													0323-4320					SEP	1998	26	5					253	262																WOS:000076296100001
J	LUNG, WS; CANALE, RP; FREEDMAN, PL				LUNG, WS; CANALE, RP; FREEDMAN, PL			PHOSPHORUS MODELS FOR EUTROPHIC LAKES	WATER RESEARCH												A model is developed for a highly eutrophic lake (White Lake, Michigan [USA]) which incorporates both the water and sediment systems and considers 2 forms of P-particulate and dissolved. Dynamic interactions of P between sediments and water are quantified by taking account particulate P sinking to the sediment-water interface and diffusion of dissolved P across the interface. Other model mechanisms include vertical eddy diffusion in the water, P transformation between the particulate form and the dissolved form in both the water and the sediment, diffusion of P in the interstitial water and sedimentation in the sediments. Extensive field data were used to determine the coefficients and parameters defined in the model formulations. Close agreement between the model calculations and the observed data is obtained, especially for the upper layers of the sediment. Sensitivity analysis for the model further substantiates the model calculations. Two separate forms of P are necessary to gain detailed insight into the dynamics of P cycling in White Lake. The model also explains significant releases of P during anaerobic periods from the sediment to the hypolimnion of White Lake in summer. The general applicability of the model to lakes having different degrees of eutrophication must be determined by an examination and analysis of data from other systems.																			0043-1354	1879-2448					1976	10	12					1101	1114		10.1016/0043-1354(76)90043-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(76)90043-9													WOS:A1976CR90300011

The air samples were taken around noon in summer at sunny weather conditions. 43 (C-6-C-13) alkyl mononitrates, 24 (C-3-C-6) alkyl dinitrates, and 19 (C-2-C-6) hydroxy alkyl nitrates have been identified. The analytical protocol included high-volume-sampling, NP-HPLC group separation, high resolution capillary gas chromatography, and detection by the highly selective mass spectrometer detector (SIM mode, m/z = 46). The levels of the sum of 15 (C-6-C-10) alkyl mononitrates ranged from 2.9 to 11.0 parts per trillion (ppt(v)). The levels of the sum of 21 (C-3-C-6) alkyl dinitrates ranged from 2.3 to 10.5 ppt(v), and the levels of the sum of 7 (C-2-C-4) hydroxy alkyl nitrates ranged from 7.3 to 28 ppt(v), respectively, in the urban air samples. These results emphazise the contribution of the alkyl dinitrates and hydroxy alkyl nitrates besides the alkyl mononitrates to the budget of NOY compounds. No major differences in levels and pattern of the organic nitrates are present in air of the German and the US cities.																			0937-0633					SEP-OCT	2000	368	2-3					244	249		10.1007/s002160000550	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s002160000550								11220587					WOS:000089511400020

Dissolved methane and carbon dioxide fluxes in Subarctic and Arctic regions: Assessing measurement techniques and spatial gradients	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												Here we use a portable method to obtain high spatial resolution measurements of concentrations and calculate diffusive water-to-air fluxes of CH4 and CO2 from two Subarctic coastal regions (Kasitsna and Jakolof Bays) and an Arctic lake (Toolik Lake). The goals of this study are to determine distributions of these concentrations and fluxes to (1) critically evaluate the established protocols of collecting discrete water samples for these determinations, and to (2) provide a first-order extrapolation of the regional impacts of these diffusive atmospheric fluxes. Our measurements show that these environments are highly heterogeneous. Areas with the highest dissolved CH4 and CO2 concentrations were isolated, covering less than 21% of the total lake and bay areas, and significant errors can be introduced if the collection of discrete water samples does not adequately characterize these spatial distributions. A first order extrapolation of diffusive fluxes to all Arctic regions with similar characteristics as Toolik Lake suggests that these lakes are likely supplying 0.21 and 15.77 Tg of CH4 and CO2 to the atmosphere annually, respectively. Similarly, we found that the Subarctic Coastal Ocean is likely supplying 0.027 Tg of CH4 annually and is taking up roughly 524 Tg of CO2 per year. Although diffusive fluxes at Toolik Lake may not be as substantial when comparing against present seep ebullition and spring ice-out values, warming in the Arctic may result in the increase of methane discharge and methane emissions to the atmosphere. Thus further work is needed to understand this changing environment. This study suggests that high spatial resolution measurement protocols, similar to the one used here, should be incorporated into field campaigns to reduce regional uncertainty and refine global emission estimates.

Can a Rapid Underwater Video Approach Enhance the Benthic Assessment Capability of the National Coastal Condition Assessment in the Great Lakes?	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Over 400 sites were sampled in the nearshore of the U.S. Great Lakes during the U.S. National Coastal Condition Assessment (NCCA) field survey in summer 2010. Underwater video images were recorded in addition to routine NCCA benthic assessment measures. This paper has two objectives: (1) to develop a process to evaluate video performance with acceptance criteria, exploring reasons for poor images, and (2) to use acceptable videos in an example application with invasive mussels, evaluating the enhancement potential of video to supplement traditional grab sampling. A standard hierarchical protocol was developed to rank video performance based on quality and clarity. We determined controllable and uncontrollable factors affecting video performance. Moreover, specific thresholds limiting video were identified: > 0.5/m for light extinction and > 3.5 A mu g/L for chlorophyll a concentration. To demonstrate the utility and enhancement potential of video sampling, observed dreissenid presence from excellent (221 of 362 videos) videos was compared with NCCA benthic taxonomy, in the context of the statistically based NCCA survey. Including video increased the overall area estimate of the U.S. Great Lakes nearshore with invasive mussels by about 15 % compared to PONAR alone; 44 % (7570 km(2)) of the surveyed region had mussels. The proportion of the nearshore area having mussels varied from low (3.5 %) in Lake Superior to > 50 % in the lower lakes. PONAR and video have unique strengths and weaknesses as sampling tools in the Great Lakes nearshore environment, but when paired were complimentary and thus provided a more thorough benthic condition assessment at lake and regional scales.																			0364-152X	1432-1009				JUN	2015	55	6					1446	1456		10.1007/s00267-015-0475-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-015-0475-3								25832344					WOS:000354730700019
J	Larsen, D				Larsen, Daniel			Revisiting silicate authigenesis in the Pliocene-Pleistocene Lake Tecopa beds, southeastern California: Depositional and hydrological controls	GEOSPHERE												The Pliocene-Pleistocene Lake Tecopa beds present a well-documented example of authigenic silicate diagenesis in an ancient saline, alkaline lake environment. Controls on authigenic mineral formation and distributions were investigated in nine stratigraphic sections aligned along a north-south transect in the Tecopa basin. Specifically, potential depositional and hydrologic controls on mineral assemblages and distributions were addressed by correlating detailed sedimentological data and basin hydrology with authigenic mineral facies distributions. Deposition occurred within the Lake Tecopa basin in environments ranging from alluvial and eolian around the basin margin to lake margin, mudflat, and shallow and perennial lacustrine in the basin center. The authigenic silicate minerals include trioctahedral smectite, phillipsite, clinoptilolite, opal C-T (cristobalite-tridymite), potassium feldspar, illite, albite, and searlesite, as well as many other minor or less commonly observed phases. Authigenic mineral distributions along the margin of the basin are strongly controlled by sediment composition (primarily tuffaceous component) and lake-level variations. Authigenic mineral compositions in the center of the basin are dominated by feldspar, illite, and searlesite, and are less influenced by sediment composition or short-term changes in lake level. The authigenic silicate mineral composition in the central part of the basin is interpreted to be a result of chemical interaction with a saline, alkaline brine that moved in accord with lake-level changes and induced density-driven circulation. The results suggest that distributions of authigenic silicate minerals in saline, alkaline lake deposits are complexly related to depositional and hydrologic processes and may be of limited utility in resolving lake-level changes in ancient lacustrine systems.																			1553-040X					JUN	2008	4	3					612	639		10.1130/GES00152.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/GES00152.1													WOS:000256257600010

A calanoid copepod, Leptodiaptomus minutus, was collected from a relatively UV-transparent lake in Pennsylvania where levels of copepod MAAS and carotenoids vary during the year (MAAS high/carotenoids low in summer). Animals raised in the laboratory under different diet/UVR treatments accumulated MAAS from an MAA-producing dinoflagellate but not from a cryptomonad that lacks them. The acquisition efficiency increased under exposure to UVR-supplemented photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 400-700 nm), yielding MAA concentrations up to 0.7% dry weight compared with only 0.3% under unsupplemented PAR. Proportions of individual MAAS differed between the animals and their diet. Shorter wavelength absorbing palythine and shinorine (lambda(max) 320 and 334 run, respectively) were disproportionately accumulated over usujirene and palythene (lambda(max) ca. 359 nm). Carotenoids accumulated under UVR exposure (to 1% dry weight) when dietary MAAS were not available. Tolerance of ultra-violet-B (UV-B) radiation was assessed as LE(50)s (UV exposure giving 50% mortality after 5 d) following 12-h acute exposure to artificial UV-B radiation. LE,os increased 2.5-fold for UV-acclimated, MAA-rich animals, but only 1.5-fold for UV-acclimated, carotenoid-rich animals. Compared with carotenoids, MAAS offer this copepod a more effective photoprotection strategy, potentially as important as photorepair of DNA damage, to promote tolerance of natural levels of UV-B radiation.

Relation between fish harvest, prey availability and great cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis) diet	ITALIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												The increase in numbers and range of the continental subspecies of great cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis in Europe has led to a growing number of conflicts with commercial fisheries and recreational angling. We investigated the dietary preferences (fish species and size classes) of wintering cormorants in two freshwater basins in Northern Italy, using pellet analysis and data on fish community composition. First, we compared cormorant diet (biomass of fish species consumed) with the annual harvest by professional fishing (biomass/year). Second, we compared diet with a measure of prey availability: direct fish sampling with nets of different mesh size. Cormorants preyed mainly on cyprinid fish. A comparison of pellet analysis and commercial fishing data showed that some fish species consumed by cormorants did not occur in the commercial harvest. Using only species that occurred in the diet and in the commercial harvest, there was no relationship between the amount of fish of different species taken. A positive correlation between pellet analysis data (consumed) and data from scientific fish sampling (available) showed that cormorants exploited fish resources on the basis of prey availability. Comparing the size of fish collected from nets and fish consumed by cormorants also showed that birds were selective with respect to prey size, picking mostly small individuals (< 110g). We conclude that potential effects of cormorants on commercially important fish will mainly depend on habitat type (fish ponds, natural deep lakes, others), and that in the natural lakes in Lombardy cormorants mainly concentrate on species which are of limited value for commercial fishing.					; Martinoli, Adriano/L-4924-2016; Preatoni, Damiano/A-8621-2010	Wauters, Lucas Armand/0000-0002-7012-9200; Martinoli, Adriano/0000-0003-0298-0869; 													1125-0003	1748-5851				OCT 2	2015	82	4					544	555		10.1080/11250003.2015.1093661	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11250003.2015.1093661													WOS:000364558700010

Comparison of largemouth bass assessment metrics between standardized and historical sampling designs at six Florida lakes	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Standardized protocols for sampling fish in lentic systems were recently established for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. One of the main concerns of state biologists is that standard sampling methods could reduce the value and comparability of long-standing, fixed-transect historical data sets. Therefore, largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides were sampled by electrofishing in six lakes using both the historical and the new standard methods in spring 2006. Based on a two-way analysis of variance, the mean log-transformed catch per unit effort (CPUE) and proportional size structure of quality-size fish (PSSQ) and preferred-size fish (PSSP) did not differ significantly between the two sampling methods for any take, when all samples were included. Based on bootstrapping analyses, which controlled for differences in sample sizes between the standard and historical methods, the variation associated with mean CPUE was generally higher for the standard method, whereas the variation associated with mean PSSP was generally higher for the historical method. Aside from PSSQ, the sample size required to obtain adequate levels of power and detection were met only by the standard method, for which a larger number of samples were collected. Our study suggests that the point estimates (i.e., means) from the historical methods can be used in trend analyses in concert with the new standard methods but that the standard method provides for better comparisons among water bodies.

J	Wirth, SB; Bouffard, D; Zopfi, J				Wirth, Stefanie B.; Bouffard, Damien; Zopfi, Jakob			Lacustrine Groundwater Discharge Through Giant Pockmarks (Lake Neuchatel, Switzerland)	FRONTIERS IN WATER												Pockmarks are circular depressions on the floor of oceans and lakes and constitute potential hot spots of gas ebullition and/or groundwater discharge. Marine pockmarks are well-studied, whereas lacustrine pockmarks are virtually unexplored. In Lake Neuchatel (Switzerland) four giant pockmarks of 80 to 150 m in diameter are located along the northern shore and adjacent to the karst system of the Jura Mountains. Two pockmarks have a similar to 60 m-deep chimney filled with mud; two are funnel-shaped 12 and 29 m deep holes. We present evidence for the presence of groundwater in the pockmark chimneys and active lacustrine groundwater discharge (LGD) at both pockmark types. Temperature, electrical conductivity and calcium concentrations of the pore water in the chimneys show values typical for karst water (maximal sampling and profiling depth: 41 m into the pockmark) and contrast strongly with the properties of the lake water. TOC and TIC indicate that the chimney mud is homogenized and composed of liquefied sediments from the entire deglacial to Holocene lacustrine sediment succession. Mini mud volcanoes apparent on the suspension surface imaged with a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) localize the groundwater exit points and confirm LGD. LGD is further corroborated by electrical conductivity anomalies detected above the lutoclines and within a funnel-shaped pockmark during the ROV survey. We conclude that the giant pockmarks in Lake Neuchatel represent a type of subaquatic springs that connect the water body of the lake with the karst system. A next essential research step will be to quantify LGD via the pockmarks in order to assess their lake-wide relevance. This study underlines the existing need for research on the connectivity of lakes and oceans with groundwater systems for completing our understanding of the hydrological cycle.

For this, two particulate air samples per day were collected onto quartz fiber filters at the Loyola University Chicago Air Station (LUCAS) during the summer months of 2002 and 2003 and subsequently analyzed by ion chromatography for sulfate, nitrate and oxalate. In parallel, mixing ratios of ozone (O-3) and nitrogen oxides (NO and NO2=NOx) were monitored and weather parameters were recorded. In addition, backward trajectories were obtained to estimate air mass transport to Chicago. Ozone and NOx mixing ratios as well as sulfate, nitrate and oxalate concentrations varied substantially throughout the study, but three situations could be distinguished based on meteorology and chemistry. Case one had the lowest ozone, NOx and ion levels due to wind directions constantly from Lake Michigan. Case two comprised of days showing the highest pollutant levels because of to predominantly southwestern air currents and warm temperatures and case three experienced an air stagnation situation in the morning leading to high NOx mixing ratios and a subsequent lake breeze event. In the last case, elevated ozone mixing ratios and ion concentrations were observed after lake breeze onset indicating pollutant transport. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The concentrations of major nutrient ions were probably not limiting to algal growth, and good nutrient replenishment was provided by the 2 inflow rivers. Nyumba ya Mungu supports a rich phytoplanton dominated by Melosira and blue-green algae. Acetone extractions gave chlorophyll a concentrations ranging from 20-40 mg m-3 in the vertical profiles, and light and dark bottle experiments indicated a maximum gross photosynthesis of about 800 mg O2 m-3 h-1. There was evidence of chemical stratification in the open water and diurnal stratification in the sheltered bays, but discontinuities were short-lived and the trade winds ensured regular mixing of the water. The lake appeared to have a higher primary production than the larger Rift Valley lakes, and it was considered that this level of production would continue.

In this study, we provided glacier area delineation of Ala-Archa valley glaciers by using a Sentinel-1 SAR dataset and the InSAR Coherence technique. Since glaciers have specific patterns of movement, the low coherence method signals the presence of ice. The analysis used the pair of Sentinel-1 datasets for the summer, to ensure the lowest coherence and provide an areal estimation during the peak of ablation. The independence of the SAR images from cloud and light conditions permits us to acquire the images in a timely manner, which highly affects the results of glacier monitoring. This method has shown high potential in the mapping of debris-covered ice and the indication of dead ice. To identify and separate areas of low coherence, such as glacier lakes and unstable slopes, we used object-based mapping by using the geomorphological features of the ice. In this study, we defined a coherence value of less than 0.3 in the glacier area. Our research identified a number of 56 glaciers within the study area of 31.45 km(2) and obtained highly accurate glacier maps for the glaciers with a smooth terminus. The analysis shows that automatic and manual delineation of the glaciers' boundaries have certain limitations, but using the advantages of both scientific approaches, further studies will generate more accurate results.					; Duishonakunov / Дуйшонакунов, Murataly / Мураталы/F-4023-2018; Voda, Mihai/G-8547-2018; Voda, Mihai/B-9879-2011	Du, Qingyun/0000-0003-4615-2029; Voda, Mihai/0000-0002-6639-0561; Zholdoshbekov, Emilbek/0000-0001-6730-5560; 														2072-4292				FEB	2023	15	4							1131	10.3390/rs15041131	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs15041131													WOS:000939985100001

SETTING: John A. Moran Eye Center, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA. DESIGN: Experimental study. METHODS: Twelve New Zealand rabbits had bilateral implantation of a protective membrane and an IOL or an IOL alone. Three groups of 8 eyes each received the IOL and the smooth protective membrane, the IOL and the patterned membrane, or the IOL alone. Slitlamp examination was performed weekly for 4 weeks. The rabbits were then humanely killed and their globes enucleated. Capsular bag opacification was scored based on the Miyake-Apple view, and the eyes underwent histopathology. RESULTS: At 4 weeks, the mean central posterior capsule opacification (PCO) score was 0.28 +/- 0.32 (SD) in all eyes with a protective membrane and 2.08 +/- 1.28 in eyes with the IOL alone (P<.00001, Student ttest). Peripheral PCO and Soemmerring ring formation were also significantly less in eyes with the protective membrane. Histopathologically, the posterior capsules were relatively clear in most IOLs with the protective membrane. The smooth and patterned protective membranes showed a significant difference in overall capsular bag opacification formation compared with the IOLs without the membrane. CONCLUSIONS: The circular geometry of the protective membrane led to expansion of the capsular bag and appeared to prevent capsular bag opacification. Further studies are warranted to assess whether the pattern on the device's posterior surface further enhances this effect.

This ethnographic study examines the risk management of the Svinafellsheioi mountain in south -east Iceland. Scientific monitoring suggests that an estimated 60-100 million cubic metres of bedrock could fall onto the glacier below, and cause flooding or a tsunami in the proglacial lake. A no-build zone was in place between 2018 and 2020 to prevent a further increase in the number of people exposed to the hazard. Our results indicate that the no-build zone had adverse effects on the psychosocial wellbeing of those affected including frustration about a perceived inability to make changes to their home and business operations, leaving them feeling that their future was uncertain or on hold. These frustrations also acted as a persistent reminder of the risk posed by the unstable slope, reinforcing anxiety and undermining people's ability to gain respite through day -to-day routine. Based on the findings, we recommend that land use planners take the psychosocial wellbeing of affected communities into account when contemplating no-build zones, and that psychosocial support be offered especially when a small group of people face an existential threat for an extended period.

A laboratory trial of the compatibility of the predators Mesocyclops aspericornis and Toxorhynchites speciosus in small container habitats showed that 4th-instar Tx. speciosus did not significantly affect M. aspericornis mortality. Introduced M. aspericornis and naturally occuring Tx. speciosus were found to form a compatible predator pair for reduction of larval Ae. notoscriptus and Culex quinquefasciatus populations in tire habitats. Over 22 months of field survey, 97% of tires without predators contained mosquito larvae, at a median density of 43 larvae/liter. By comparison, 51% of tires containing both predator species held mosquito larvae at a median density of 4 larvae/liter. Predation by Tx. speciosus persisted for the duration of the study. The inability of the Lake Kurwongbah strain of M. aspericornis to tolerate temperatures of less than or equal to 10 degrees C, which are prevalent in Brisbane during winter, resulted in a failure to deliver persistent reduction of mosquitoes in tires. The temperature-dependent population characteristics of M. aspericornis emphasize the long-recognized importance of matching a biological control candidate's physiological requirements to the environment in which control is sought.																			8756-971X					SEP	1996	12	3	1				414	420											8887220					WOS:A1996VJ44700006

The analyses of the pair-wise correlations across time series revealed a strong synchrony in climatic variables among the lakes. A significant, but weak increase in air temperature was observed and resulted in a corresponding increase in surface water temperature only in summer. Lake physico-chemical variables had weaker synchrony than climatic variables. Synchrony in water temperature and stratification was stronger than lake chemistry as the former is mostly affected by atmospheric energy flux. Synchrony in the taxonomic richness of the plankton groups and phytoplankton biomass was apparent, to a similar degree as observed for lake chemistry. The synchrony and the temporal trends in lake chemistry and plankton were more pronounced for the lakes with strong re-oligotrophication. Phytoplankton biomass decreased and plankton richness increased in these lakes, with a shift from Chlorophyta dominance towards more heterogeneous phytoplankton communities. Notably, a widespread significant positive trend in plankton richness was observed not only in lakes with strong re-oligotrophication but across all lakes. The widespread increase in plankton richness coincided with widespread decrease in phosphate and total nitrogen concentrations, as well as with the trends in climate indicating a likely joint effect of nutrient reduction and climate in driving lake plankton. However, temporal changes and synchrony as well as the recovery of richness and composition of lake plankton more coherently corresponded with the nutrient loading reduction across the Danish landscape, while the role of climate control of the lake plankton was less pronounced.

For this study, fish were collected in 1998 from the Cootes Paradise region of Hamilton Harbour in western Lake Ontario, Canada, to determine whether gonadal abnormalities, including intersex, were present in young of the year (YOY) fish. No gonadal abnormalities were observed in goldfish (Carassius auratus), common carp (Cyprinus carpio), gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum), brown bullhead (Ictalurus ameiurus), pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus), and bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus). However, intersex gonads were observed in 8 of 16 male white perch (Morone americana) examined in this survey. Subsequently, in 1999 and 2000 white perch estimated to be YOY to approximately 2 years of age were collected from Cootes Paradise and from two other sites in the lower Great Lakes region. Gonadal intersex was observed in male white perch collected from the Bay of Quinte (22-44%) and Lake St. Clair (45%), although the prevalence and the extent of the intersex condition were lower relative to the 83% prevalence in white perch collected in Comes Paradise. Intersex was not observed in hatchery-reared white perch or in white perch collected from an uncontaminated reference site (i.e., Deal Lake) in the United States. An analysis of plasma collected in the spring of 2002 from male adult white perch in Comes Paradise revealed high concentrations of vitellogenin, ranging from 49 to 1,711 mug/mL. These observations indicate that male white perch are exposed to estrogenic endocrine-disrupting substances that may be responsible for the induction of gonadal intersex.																			0091-6765	1552-9924				JUN	2004	112	8					898	902		10.1289/ehp.6514	http://dx.doi.org/10.1289/ehp.6514								15175179					WOS:000222018200040

Here, we use fossil pollen records from two cores recovered from Balikun Lake, eastern Tien Shan, to reconstruct regional Holocene vegetation dynamics and environmental change. These records are combined with present-day pollen assemblages measured in samples from airborne pollen traps and soils across the catchment. We find that halophytes from saline-alkali habitats dominated the traps and near-shore surface samples, implying that halophytes are the primary local pollen source when the lake-shore environment becomes drier. A high relative abundance of Chenopodioideae pollen during the early Holocene in our near lakeshore (BLK06) core implies significant shrinkage of the lake area, linked to increased aridity across the MLA. When combined with inferred low temperatures, we propose a widespread expansion of desert vegetation under cold-and-dry conditions. A consistent abundance of Pinus, Picea, Betula pollen in both cores implies a common source areas characterized by widespread forests, in addition to locally-derived pollen, during the mid-Holocene. We infer that these changes correspond to increasing growing degree days, promoted by ice sheet retreat and increased winter insolation during the mid-Holocene. This allowed alpine forests to expand extensively along the Tien Shan Mountain. In the late Holocene, tree cover gradually shrunk as temperate grassland expanded in response to increased effective moisture, associated with increased intensity of westerlies coupled with lower temperatures linked to decreased insolation. We propose that rising temperatures in the recent past and near future will act to enhance the glacial meltwater supply in the MLA drylands, yielding an increase in both the growing degree days and the moisture conditions, which will drive expansion of the mountain forest and grassland biomes.					li, yuan/GZH-3511-2022; jiaju, zhao/ABZ-9580-2022; Wang, Xuelian/B-1089-2019	An, Cheng-Bang/0000-0002-4443-0518													0341-8162	1872-6887				JUN	2022	213								106212	10.1016/j.catena.2022.106212	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.106212		MAR 2022											WOS:000821279600007

Mitochondrial volume density and evidence for its role in adaptive divergence in response to thermal tolerance in threespine stickleback	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY												Phenotypic plasticity is predicted to permit persistence in new environments, and may subsequently evolve to enhance fitness. Colonizing environments with lower winter temperatures can lead to the evolution of lower critical thermal minima; the corresponding physiological traits associated with temperature tolerance are predicted to involve mitochondrial function. Threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) have colonized freshwater lakes along the Pacific Northwest. These freshwater populations are known to exhibit cold-induced increases in mitochondrial volume density in pectoral muscle, but whether such plasticity evolved before or after colonization is uncertain. Here, we measure critical thermal minima (CTmin) in one marine and one freshwater population of threespine stickleback, and mitochondrial volume density in pectoral and cardiac tissue of both populations acclimated to different temperature treatments (6.2, 14.5 and 20.6 celcius). Mitochondrial volume density increased with cold acclimation in pectoral muscle; cardiac muscle was non-plastic but had elevated mitochondrial volume densities compared to pectoral muscle across all temperature treatments. There were no differences in the levels of plasticity between marine and freshwater stickleback, but neither were there differences in CTmin. Importantly, marine stickleback exhibited plasticity under low-salinity conditions, suggesting that marine stickleback had at least one necessary phenotype for persistence in freshwater environments before colonization occurred.					; Smith Wuitchik, Sara/AFP-4130-2022	Morris, Matthew/0000-0002-5998-0168; Smith, Sara Jayne/0000-0002-1913-0396													0174-1578	1432-136X				JUL	2021	191	4					657	668		10.1007/s00360-021-01366-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00360-021-01366-w		MAR 2021						33788018					WOS:000635520100001

Additionally, we explored the link between the crane population size and hydrological conditions at the lake from 2011 to 2019. Meanwhile, five environmental factors, including habitat type, distance from shallow lakes, human footprint index, elevation and normalized vegetation index were selected, and the distribution patterns of suitable habitats for the Siberian crane under 10 water level gradients with intervals of about 1 m (5.3-14.2 m) were simulated by using an improved habitat suitability index model that determines the weights of evaluating factors based on the MaxEnt model. The results showed that the overall trend of the inundated area in Poyang Lake was shrinking in the last 20 years, with a significant increase in the area of exposed floodland during the early wintering period (Z = -2.26). The prolonged drought resulting from this will force vegetation succession, thereby diminishing the food resources for cranes in their natural habitat. The mean inundated area in June demonstrated a significant negative correlation with the population of Siberian cranes in natural habitats (r = -0.75, p = 0.02). Shortage of the Siberian crane-preferred Vallisneria tuber due to June flooding was the primary driver of the crane's altered foraging strategy and habitat shift. In years with relatively normal June inundation, indicating abundant Vallisneria resources, the relationship between the inundated area during the dry season and the crane population fit well, with a quadratic curve (R-2 = 0.92, p = 0.02). The dry season's inundated area primarily affected the crane population and distribution pattern by influencing the availability of food resources, and both excessive and insufficient inundation areas were unfavorable for crane survival. The modeling results for habitat suitability indicated that as the water level decreased, the trend of the area of good habitat for the Siberian crane showed an inverted bell shape, peaking at a water level of 8.8 m, with optimal conditions occurring between 8 and 10 m. The combined effects of climate and human activities have made the shortage of food resources in Poyang Lake the new normal. The degradation of natural habitats has led to a decline in the quality of Siberian crane habitats, and artificial habitats can only be used as refuges to a certain extent. Thus, formulating strategies to restore natural habitats and enhance the management of artificial habitats is crucial for the conservation efforts of Siberian cranes.																			2076-2615					JAN	2024	14	2							234	10.3390/ani14020234	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani14020234								38254403					WOS:001151936700001

In this study, we provide the first RPP estimates for 13 taxa from the forest steppe ecoregion in southeastern Romania (southeastern Europe). We used modern pollen assemblages from 26 points together with vegetation surveys and mapping, covering a 1.5 km radius around each sampling site. We have estimated the relevant source area of pollen (RSAP) and pollen productivity for 13 taxa relative to Poaceae using the ERV (Extended R-value model), sub-model 3, as this model shows the best goodness of fit. The estimated RSAP is about 100 m and falls within the range of RSAP estimates of moss pollsters and forest hollows from other RPP-related studies. Results show that Rubiaceae (7.97), Apiaceae (5.91), Artemisia (5.89) and Fraxinus (2.99) are high pollen producers compared to Poaceae, while Plantago lanceolata (0.58), Fabaceae (0.40), Acer (0.30), Rosaceae (0.29), Carpinus orientalis (0.24), Cerealia (0.22) and Asteraceae (0.16) are low pollen producers with lower RPPs than Poaceae. Quercus (1.10) has a pollen productivity close to that of Poaceae. The RPP5 for Carpinus orientalis and Fabaceae are published here the first time for Europe. The high pollen producing plants include both entomophilous and anemophilous species, while the low pollen producers are mostly entomophilous species. Our results form an essential contribution to improving the accuracy of quantitative reconstruction of forest steppe ecoregion in Europe and generally in regions with a similar climate and vegetation setting.

Thermocline deepening boosts ecosystem metabolism: evidence from a large-scale lake enclosure experiment simulating a summer storm	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Extreme weather events can pervasively influence ecosystems. Observations in lakes indicate that severe storms in particular can have pronounced ecosystem-scale consequences, but the underlying mechanisms have not been rigorously assessed in experiments. One major effect of storms on lakes is the redistribution of mineral resources and plankton communities as a result of abrupt thermocline deepening. We aimed at elucidating the importance of this effect by mimicking in replicated large enclosures (each 9 m in diameter, ca. 20 m deep, ca. 1300 m 3 in volume) a mixing event caused by a severe natural storm that was previously observed in a deep clear-water lake. Metabolic rates were derived from diel changes in vertical profiles of dissolved oxygen concentrations using a Bayesian modelling approach, based on high-frequency measurements. Experimental thermocline deepening stimulated daily gross primary production (GPP) in surface waters by an average of 63% for > 4 weeks even though thermal stratification re-established within 5 days. Ecosystem respiration (ER) was tightly coupled to GPP, exceeding that in control enclosures by 53% over the same period. As GPP responded more strongly than ER, net ecosystem productivity (NEP) of the entire water column was also increased. These protracted increases in ecosystem metabolism and autotrophy were driven by a proliferation of inedible filamentous cyanobacteria released from light and nutrient limitation after they were entrained from below the thermocline into the surface water. Thus, thermocline deepening by a single severe storm can induce prolonged responses of lake ecosystem metabolism independent of other storm-induced effects, such as inputs of terrestrial materials by increased catchment run-off. This highlights that future shifts in frequency, severity or timing of storms are an important component of climate change, whose impacts on lake thermal structure will superimpose upon climate trends to influence algal dynamics and organic matter cycling in clear-water lakes.

J	Klein, ES; Berg, EE; Dial, R				Klein, Eric S.; Berg, Edward E.; Dial, Roman			Reply to comment by Gracz on "Wetland drying and succession across the Kenai Peninsula Lowlands, south-central Alaska"	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH												Gracz (2011, Can. J. For. Res. 41: 425-428) proposes that the Good Friday earthquake of 1964 caused falling lake levels and drying wetlands on Alaska's Northern Kenai Lowlands (NKL). His hypothesis states that the earthquake increased hydraulic conductivity by fracturing a leaky confining layer, accelerating drainage of surface water into regional aquifers. We counter that a single model of draining does not apply across the heterogeneity of geomorphology and soils on the NKL. In particular, the NKL's glacial history precludes uniform application of a subsurface hydrologic model for lake draining and the nature of peat-based wetlands precludes its application to wetland drying. Instead, small, yet cumulative, climatic reductions in moisture surplus explain both observed lake level declines and vegetation changes. Moreover, and unlike a climatic hypothesis, a seismic hypothesis fails to explain lake drying elsewhere in Alaska. Although it is likely that the earthquake influenced some hydrologic features in the NKL, it is unlikely that a single hydrologic model based on a simple mechanical cause, e. g., downward drainage, adequately explains the changes observed across the whole NKL. Conversely, we maintain that the uniformity of the vegetation response seen across different landscapes, including wetlands, forests, and alpine areas, throughout the state of Alaska strongly supports a climatic hypothesis.

Patterns of Bythotrephes longimanus distribution relative to native macroinvertebrates and zooplankton prey	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												As exotic species are introduced and spread across a heterogeneous landscape, the abundance and richness of potential competitor and prey species they encounter will vary. Little is known about the interactions between Bythotrephes longimanus and native predatory macroinvertebrates (e.g., Mysis, Chaoborus), which potentially limit the establishment and spread of the invader. An 80-lake survey was conducted in the summer of 2007 to obtain macroinvertebrate abundances across invaded and non-invaded lakes. A subset (15) of these lakes was surveyed more intensively to obtain stratified daytime and night-time distributions of the organisms. Overall co-occurrence of Bythotrephes with native macroinvertebrate predators was widespread across lakes indicating that the presence of native macroinvertebrates alone is unlikely to limit the establishment of Bythotrephes. However, we did find an effect of native macroinvertebrate predators on the vertical distribution of Bythotrephes: as native macroinvertebrate abundances increased, the relative abundance of Bythotrephes in the epilimnion increased. Furthermore, the relative abundance of some zooplankton prey (e.g., Daphnia) was lower in the epilimnion when Bythotrephes abundance was high. Although we cannot rule out consumptive effects, some evidence suggests an avoidance behavioural response in the prey. While the underlying mechanisms of these distributional shifts remain unclear, our results suggest that interactions between Bythotrephes, native macroinvertebrates and zooplankton prey are complex, highlighting the need to further examine these interactions.					; Beisner, Beatrix/ABG-7855-2020	Arnott, Shelley/0000-0002-3834-703X; Beisner, Beatrix/0000-0001-6972-6887													1387-3547	1573-1464				NOV	2011	13	11			SI		2573	2594		10.1007/s10530-011-0072-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-011-0072-1													WOS:000296352600011
J	Barbieri, A; Pozzi, S; Mosello, R				Barbieri, A; Pozzi, S; Mosello, R			Relative contribution of nitrogen and sulphur to deposition acidity and regional modelling in Lake Maggiore watershed (Southern Alps, Switzerland and Italy)	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Over the last 20 years wet deposition chemistry in the Lake Maggiore watershed has been studied at 13 sites distributed at different altitudes throughout the territory. At the end of the 1990s, 55% of actual acidity values were derived from sulphur oxide compounds, and 45% from nitrogen oxides. Of potential acidity, 30% was attributable to sulphur oxide compounds, 25% to nitrogen oxides and 45% to the oxidation of reduced nitrogen compounds. Largely due to a reduction in the sulphur content of fuel oils, actual acidity and sulphate concentrations fell by 70 and 50%, respectively. Unlike sulphate, nitrogen compound concentrations did not show any major variations during this period, so that the potential acidity values which also take account of the acidity released by ammonium at environmental receptor level, decreased by only 35%. Principal Component Analysis highlighted the existence of an ionic concentration gradient along a south-north axis and with altitude. This made it possible to construct some empirical regression models to estimate concentrations of the major ions in function of geographical variables. These represent the distance from the main sources of pollutant emissions (Po Valley, Northern Italy). The models obtained are highly descriptive and predictive, and constitute an effective tool in calculating high definition maps.

J	Scharfenberger, U; Mahdy, A; Adrian, R				Scharfenberger, Ulrike; Mahdy, Aldoushy; Adrian, Rita			Threshold-driven shifts in two copepod species: Testing ecological theory with observational data	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We used an observed abrupt shift in the dominance pattern of two coexisting copepod species in Muggelsee, a shallow eutrophic lake in Germany, to investigate mechanisms leading to this shift, by embedding our findings into the framework of intraguild predation theory and theoretical scenarios of threshold-driven regime shifts. We proposed that the abrupt increase in Cyclops kolensis, changing its status from a rare to the dominant species as available algal prey declined in the lake, was due to its superior exploitative competition for commonly consumed algal prey. However, C. kolensis was only able to thrive in the emerging low food niche when abundances of competing larger Cyclops vicinus, a predator of C. kolensis juveniles, fell below a critical threshold. This is consistent with the "state threshold scenario" of regime shift theory, for which a response variable exhibits an abrupt shift, here C. kolensis, after the driver (C. vicinus) crosses a threshold. We confirmed the nonlinear relationship between the two copepod species by excluding potentially matching abrupt changes in other abiotic and biotic driving variables, and successfully classifying C. kolensis abundance probability on the basis of C. vicinus abundances using logistic generalized linear modeling. C. vicinus decline followed the "driver threshold scenario" of regime shift theory, whereby an abrupt change in a driver (cryptophytes) causes a sudden shift in a response variable (C. vicinus). We illustrated how observational data on plankton communities match predictions derived from ecological theory.					; Scharfenberger, Ulrike/B-7907-2017; Mahdy, Aldoushy/KGM-8649-2024	Mahdy, Aldoushy/0000-0002-9272-0843; Scharfenberger, Ulrike/0000-0001-9564-5327; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				MAR	2013	58	2					741	752		10.4319/lo.2013.58.2.0741	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2013.58.2.0741													WOS:000317954300025

Denitrification was demonstrated by a progressive nitrate depletion coupled to increasing delta(15)N and delta(18)O values for residual nitrate. Maximum delta(15)N and delta(18)O values amounted to 27.2 and 15.7parts per thousand, respectively. N-15 and O-18 enrichment factors for denitrification (8) were estimated using a closed-system model and a dynamic diffusion-reaction model. Using the Rayleigh equation (closed-system approach), we obtained epsilon values of -11.2 and -6.6parts per thousand for nitrogen and oxygen, respectively. The average e values derived using the diffusion-reaction model were determined to be -20.7 +/- 3.8 for nitrogen and -11.0 +/- 1.7 for oxygen. Both N and O isotope fractionation appeared to be lower, when denitrification rates where high, possibly in association with high organic carbon availability. In addition, variations in the isotope effects may be attributed to the variable importance of sedimentary denitrification having only a small isotope effect on the water column. The combined measurement of N and O isotope ratios in nitrate revealed that coupled nitrification-denitrification in the open-wafer was of minor importance. This is the first study of nitrogen and oxygen isotope effects associated with microbial denitrification in a natural lake. Moreover, this study confirms the high potential of delta(18)O of nitrate as a valuable biogeochemical tracer in aquatic systems, complementing nitrate delta(15)N.

J	Liu, SS; Lang, XM; Jiang, DB				Liu, Shanshan; Lang, Xianmei; Jiang, Dabang			Time-varying responses of dryland aridity to external forcings over the last 21 ka	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Identifying potential external forcings on dryland aridity at various timescales and clarifying underlying mechanisms can advance our knowledge of dryland climate behaviors. To address this issue, we examine the past 21 ka using a set of transient simulations driven by realistic climatic forcings, as well as multiple types of proxies. The simulations suggest the evolution of dryland aridity and dominant forcings vary over time and region. On average, global drylands feature two-phase aridification at the orbital scale: the first phase occurs before the Holocene and is dominated by ice sheet melting and rising greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations, followed by the second phase driven by the summer insolation decrease over northern high latitudes after the early Holocene; different from the wetness during the orbital-scale glacial period, millennium-scale cold events forced by meltwater discharges correspond to desiccation, punctuating the long-term trend during the last deglaciation. In addition, the average aridity changes for drylands are larger than those for global landmasses under all forcings except GHG concentrations. Spatially, the dominant external forcings and aridity responses to the same forcing vary regionally, mainly related to the latitude and hemisphere. Further diagnosis indicates the manners to affect aridity, namely through altering precipitation or evaporative capacity, vary by forcing. The aforementioned evolution of the simulated aridity matches well with the proxies in most dryland zones. This study provides a scenario of time-varying responses of dryland aridity to external forcings over the last 21 ka and may shed light on the future changes. 0 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Whilst the validity of using such frameworks in sedimentary environments such as lake basins and raised bogs has been the focus of much attention, such debates have not extended to fluvial systems. Using examples from three lowland, vertically accreting river valleys in East Anglia, UK, this paper assesses the robustness of their associated radiocarbon chronologies by assessing the contrasting age estimates that are obtained by dating different parts of the same organic sample (humic, humin and plant macrofossils) at a variety of stratigraphic levels. Overall, the humin and humic acid fraction results were statistically consistent, whilst the plant macrofossil remains were found to be of a slightly younger age. In these examples, it is argued that the younger ages appear to be the result of Phragmites (common reed) roots pushing plant macrossils through the sedimentary sequence or opening up voids for material to fall through, although studies in lacustrine and mire environments suggest alternative explanations may also be possible. Whichever explanation is preferred, this study demonstrates clearly that the complexity of valley floor stratigraphy and processes is such, that using single radiocarbon dates, whether AMS or bulk samples to reconstruct chronologies of 'geomorphic system response' may need to be refined and subjected to the same level of assessment that has been applied in other sedimentary systems.

It is poor in nutrients and the source of the Blue Nile River (Great Abbay), with a catchment area of ca 16,500 km(2). The Lake has been formed by volcanic activity, blocking the course of inflowing rivers in the early Pleistocene times ca 5 million years ago. The lava also separated the Lake and its headwaters from the lower Blue Nile basin by 40 m high falls at Tissisat, 30 kin downstream from the Blue Nile outflow. Terraces suggest that the Lake was originally much larger than it. is today. Seven large permanent rivers feed the lake as well as ca 40 small seasonal rivers. The main tributaries to the lake are Gilgel Abbay (Little Nile River), Megech River, Gumara River and the Rib River. Together they contribute more than 95% of the total annual inflow. The Blue Nile is the only outflowing river. The shallow lake (average depth 8 m, max. depth 14 m) is Ethiopia's largest lake, containing half the country's freshwater resources, and the third largest in the Nile Basin. In the main rainy season (July-August) the inflowing rivers carry heavy load of suspended silt into the lake, thereby increasing the turbidity of the lake water. The suspended sediments reduce the under water light intensity and as such the primary production, the basis of the food web. The fish community of the Lake is dominated by cyprinid fishes, 20 of the 27 fish species (e.g. Labeobarbus spp., Barbus spp., Garra spp.) are endemics to the Lake catchment. This speciation was possible because the incipient. Lake offered new habitats for adaptive radiation and maintained its isolation for millions of years from the lower Blue Nile. Wetlands are located all around the lake, with the exception of the Northeast. Together they are the largest in the country and integral parts of the complex Tana-ecosystem. They consist of permanent swamps, seasonal swamps, and areas subjected to regular inundation. During the raining period these wetlands are connected with the lake. They act as nurseries for most of the fish populations in the lake, and serve as breeding ground for water fowl and mammals. Around the lake and its catchment, including the town of Bahir Dar, live about 2 million people. This lake and adjacent wetlands provide directly and indirectly a livelihood for more than 500,000 people. The Blue Nile drains the NE Ethiopian Plateau (total catchment: 324,000 km(2)). Already in ancient Egypt civilization this river was of key importance to early agriculture and today the river is still of critical importance for the economies of Sudan and Egypt.																			0077-0639		978-1-4020-9725-6				2009	89						163	192				10.1007/978-1-4020-9726-3												WOS:000270040800009

Tectonically active, it provides useful sequences of Quaternary deposits whose deposition may have ended either when the climate dried or when the tectonic activity uplifted the riverbed. In-situ produced cosmogenic Be-10 provides surface abandonment ages at 5.6 +/- 0.6, 8.4 +/- 1.0, 12.8 +/- 1.0, 20.1 +/- 1.5, and 44.0 +/- 3.4 Be-10 kyr. Located at the transition between the Mediterranean Winter Rain and the Indian Monsoon domains, and south of the northernmost position of the ITCZ (InterTropical Convergence Zone), the studied area is very sensitive to climate changes. Some of the calculated Be-10 abandonment ages are within the entire investigated area coincidental with large-scale climate shifts: the offset of the mid-Holocene humid period (5.6 +/- 0.6 Be-10 kyr), the onset of the dry Younger Dryas cold and dry episode (12.8 +/- 1.0(10)Be kyr), and the end of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 21 +/- 2kyr)at 20.1 +/- 1.5 Be-10 kyr. These events correspond to large-scale changes in atmospheric circulation linked to global climate changes, and/or to sea-level fluctuations in the Persian Gulf, which was totally dry during the LGM. Locally observed abandonment ages at 8.4 +/- 1.0 and 44.0 +/- 3.4 Be-10 kyr may likely be related to enhanced tectonic activity without regional impact. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

J	Prentice, ML; Hope, GS; Maryunani, K; Peterson, JA				Prentice, ML; Hope, GS; Maryunani, K; Peterson, JA			An evaluation of snowline data across New Guinea during the last major glaciation, and area-based glacier snowlines in the Mt. Jaya region of Papua, Indonesia, during the Last Glacial Maximum	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Geomorphological mapping and lake-core data from Mt. Jaya, western New Guinea, show that Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) glaciation was less extensive than previously thought. Average equilibrium line altitudes (ELAs), calculated using the area-altitude-balance ratio method, for minimum and maximum ice configurations were 4050 +/- 49 and 4000 +/- 56m a.s.l., respectively. This is about 600 m below the ELA of the Mt. Jaya glaciers in 1971-73 and ca 400 m higher than values previously quoted for LGM ELAs in this area. A reappraisal of the evidence used to reconstruct the ELA of glaciers across New Guinea suggests that published chronologies are not sufficient to demonstrate that reported ELAs fall within the LGM window of 21,000 +/- 2 yr BP. Furthermore, the published information only constrains the altitude of the ELAs between 3400 and 3800 in a.s.l., not including uncertainty in topography. A simple mass and energy-balance model indicates that an ELA depression of 500 m (i.e., the observed change at Mt. Jaya after adjustment for sea-level change) could be accomplished with 2.5-3 degrees C of cooling provided precipitation was reduced by 35% and lapse rate changed. This cooling is less than the 6-8 degrees C cooling inferred from LGM pollen. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

J	ONeal, M				ONeal, M			Interactions between land cover and convective cloud cover over midwestern north America detected from GOES satellite data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The region of Midwestern North America from 80-95 degrees W and 35-55 degrees N is examined in terms of land cover and convective cloud cover during the summers of 1985 and 1989, using a combination of published land use maps and GOES visible and infrared satellite imagery, for the presence of favoured convective cloud cover over large areas (similar to 100km scale) of homogeneous forest. Days with synoptic flow are eliminated through analysis of 500-mb winds and surface frontal activity. The resulting 'weak flow' days' imagery is organized into 1 degrees x 1 degrees latitude/longitude cells, within which total cumulus cloud cover is manually determined. Three-hourly analysis of convective cloud cover from visible and infrared imagery shows forests in Ontario and the Appalachians to have greater convective cloud cover and the Great Lakes to have less convective cloud cover, on days without frontal activity. This pattern persists throughout the day, for both 1985 and 1989, despite differences in soil moisture (as determined from Crop Moisture and Palmer Drought Indices) and topography. The apparent associated cloud cover increase over forests for the Midwest matches well with similarly predicted patterns of cloud and precipitation from the existence of weak nonclassical mesoscale circulations.																			0143-1161					APR	1996	17	6					1149	1181		10.1080/01431169608949075	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431169608949075													WOS:A1996UG09500005
J	Preston, LJ; Dartnell, LR				Preston, Louisa J.; Dartnell, Lewis R.			Planetary habitability: lessons learned from terrestrial analogues	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ASTROBIOLOGY												Terrestrial analogue studies underpin almost all planetary missions and their use is essential in the exploration of our Solar system and in assessing the habitability of other worlds. Their value relies on the similarity of the analogue to its target, either in terms of their mineralogical or geochemical context, or current physical or chemical environmental conditions. Such analogue sites offer critical ground-truthing for astrobiological studies on the habitability of different environmental parameter sets, the biological mechanisms for survival in extreme environments and the preservation potential and detectability of biosignatures. The 33 analogue sites discussed in this review have been selected on the basis of their congruence to particular extraterrestrial locations. Terrestrial field sites that have been used most often in the literature, as well as some lesser known ones which require greater study, are incorporated to inform on the astrobiological potential of Venus, Mars, Europa, Enceladus and Titan. For example, the possibility of an aerial habitable zone on Venus has been hypothesized based on studies of life at high-altitudes in the terrestrial atmosphere. We also demonstrate why many different terrestrial analogue sites are required to satisfactorily assess the habitability of the changing environmental conditions throughout Martian history, and recommend particular sites for different epochs or potential niches. Finally, habitable zones within the aqueous environments of the icy moons of Europa and Enceladus and potentially in the hydrocarbon lakes of Titan are discussed and suitable analogue sites proposed. It is clear from this review that a number of terrestrial analogue sites can be applied to multiple planetary bodies, thereby increasing their value for astrobiological exploration. For each analogue site considered here, we summarize the pertinent physiochemical environmental features they offer and critically assess the fidelity with which they emulate their intended target locale. We also outline key issues associated with the existing documentation of analogue research and the constraints this has on the efficiency of discoveries in this field. This review thus highlights the need for a global open access database for planetary analogues.

J	Narancic, B; Wolfe, BB; Pienitz, R; Meyer, H; Lamhonwah, D				Narancic, Biljana; Wolfe, Brent B.; Pienitz, Reinhard; Meyer, Hanno; Lamhonwah, Daniel			Landscape-gradient assessment of thermokarst lake hydrology using water isotope tracers	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Thermokarst lakes are widespread in arctic and subarctic regions. In subarctic Quebec (Nunavik), they have grown in number and size since the mid-20th century. Recent studies have identified that these lakes are important sources of greenhouse gases. This is mainly due to the supply of catchment derived dissolved organic carbon that generates anoxic conditions leading to methane production. To assess the potential role of climate-driven changes in hydrological processes to influence greenhouse gas emissions, we utilized water isotope tracers to characterize the water balance of thermokarst lakes in Nunavik during three consecutive mid- to late summer sampling campaigns (2012-2014). Lake distribution stretches from shrub-tundra overlying discontinuous permafrost in the north to spruce-lichen woodland with sporadic permafrost in the south. Calculation of lake-specific input water isotope compositions (61) and lake-specific evaporation-to-inflow (E/I) ratios based on an isotope-mass balance model reveal a narrow hydrological gradient regardless of diversity in regional landscape characteristics. Nearly all lakes sampled were predominantly fed by rainfall and/or permafrost meltwater, which suppressed the effects of evaporative loss. Only a few lakes in one of the southern sampling locations, which overly highly degraded sporadic permafrost terrain, appear to be susceptible to evaporative lake-level drawdown. We attribute this lake hydrological resiliency to the strong maritime climate in coastal regions of Nunavik. Predicted climate-driven increases in precipitation and permafrost degradation will likely contribute to persistence and expansion of thermokarst lakes throughout the region. If coupled with an increase in terrestrial carbon inputs to thermokarst lakes from surface runoff, conditions favorable for mineralization and emission of methane, these water bodies may become even more important sources of greenhouse gases.

However, further exposure during the period of peak ambient temperatures, led to an average 20% reduction in growth, appetite, gross conversion efficiency and protein turnover. 3. Increased rates of gill protein turnover and arguably lower rates of growth indicate that the cost of living for a trout acclimated and maintained in synthetic softwater is higher than that of hardwater fish. In addition, lower appetite in softwater fish suggest that life in softwater is itself a mild form of environmental stress.					; Wood, Chris/C-3021-2009	Wood, Chris/0000-0002-9542-2219; 													0306-4565					FEB-MAY	1995	20	1-2					231	244		10.1016/0306-4565(94)00074-S	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0306-4565(94)00074-S													WOS:A1995QL61000023
J	Hörweg, C; Sattmann, H; Auer, H				Hoerweg, Christoph; Sattmann, Helmut; Auer, Herbert			Cercarial dermatitis in Austria:: Questionnaires as useful tools to estimate risk factors?	WIENER KLINISCHE WOCHENSCHRIFT					39th Annual Conference of the Austrian-Society-for-Tropical-Medicine-and-Parasitology	NOV 17-19, 2005	Med Univ Vienna, Inst Hist Med, Vienna, AUSTRIA	Austrian Soc Trop Med & Parasitol	Med Univ Vienna, Inst Hist Med			Cercarial dermatitis is a worldwide occurring skin disease characterized by itching and skin papulation. It is caused by cercariae of the fluke family Schistosomatidae. In the tropics and subtropics species of the genus Schistosoma can cause severe diseases of man. However, several genera (e.g. Trichobilharzia, Bilharziella) of medical significance are prevalent in Europe as well; they are also known as "bird schistosomes", because waterfowl is the final host. Pulmonate snails act as intermediate hosts. Humans are accidental hosts; they get infested by penetration of the cercariae into the skin of swimmers/bathers in ponds and lakes. They can not mature in humans, but die shortly after penetration. Cercarial dermatitis is known in Austria since 1969, with regularly occurrences nearly every summer. In early 2003 we created a homepage to provide information about the causative agents for the public/patients, to document the occurrences and to get data about the distribution of this parasitic disease. We therefore created a questionnaire and asked people for the following parameters: personal data, information about the waters, activity in the water and details about the dermatitis itself. A total of 34 questionnaires were returned. The results will be discussed according to their relevance as risk factors. The way how people interact with the water seems to be essential, but not demographic features. In addition, this approach revealed a new segment of the public that is at risk - owners/users of swimming ponds.

The GPR study aimed at imaging lake bottom and shallow sedimentary layers to plan coring of sediments coeval with the catastrophic 1908 explosion. The water of the Cheko Lake strongly attenuates radar waves. Therefore, the central and northern sectors of the lake (30 m average depth) were surveyed by means of acoustic techniques only. Integrated acoustic and GPR techniques were used in the shallow southern sector. More than 5 km of radar profiles were obtained in the lake, using 50 MHz and 100 MHz antennas. 150 metres of 200 MHz multi-fold profiles were obtained across the only accessible sectors on land. The GPR profiles processed to date successfully image discontinuities at depths greater than 700 cm. Comparison with acoustic results shows that GPR provides high resolution images of the depth range of interest (0-500 cm) which complement the information obtained from subbottom profilers and can be calibrated by the gravity cores. A deep (700 cm) flat sub-horizontal reflector, shallow (0-200 cm) dipping layers, sigmoidal structures and local chaotic lenses are the primary features imaged by GPR in the lake.					; baradello, luca/AAF-3173-2021; Gasperini, Luca/B-8796-2017; pipan, michele/AAX-6851-2021	baradello, luca/0000-0002-9796-4521; Bonatti, Enrico/0000-0001-6162-9572; Gasperini, Luca/0000-0002-0276-0607; pipan, michele/0000-0003-3095-6305; Forte, Emanuele/0000-0002-5995-9254													0277-786X		0-8194-3726-3				2000	4084						329	334		10.1117/12.383586	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.383586													WOS:000088778100059
J	Russell, JM; Werne, JP				Russell, James M.; Werne, Josef P.			Climate change and productivity variations recorded by sedimentary sulfur in Lake Edward, Uganda/D. R. Congo	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												We investigate changes in the sulfur geochemistry of sediment cores from Lake Edward, Uganda/Congo to constrain the effects of recent climate changes in the region on the partitioning and isotopic composition of reduced sedimentary sulfur. We measured the concentration and isotopic composition of kerogen sulfur, chromium-reducible, and acid-volatile sulfides, as well as the abundance and partitioning of sedimentary phosphorus and iron, and the abundance and isotopic composition of organic carbon and nitrogen. Results indicate an approximately 150% increase in sulfur concentrations in sediments from Lake Edward over the past 200 years, during which time rainfall in the basin increased and the salinity of the lake fell. Increased sulfur concentrations are largely accounted for by increasing concentrations of kerogen sulfur, which is likely caused by environmentally-driven changes in organic matter quality and concentration, including increased anoxia and nutrient supply to the lake during wet intervals. The isotopic compositions of sedimentary sulfur pools support our interpretation that organic sulfur is derived primarily from sulfurization reactions in the sediment rather than primary bio-sulfur, and gradual isotopic enrichment of the delta S-34 of sedimentary pyrite and kerogen sulfur could result from decreased lake salinity and sulfate availability during the past 200 years. These results highlight the importance of understanding environmentally-mediated changes in organic sulfur accumulation in interpreting the sulfur geochemistry of sediments and sedimentary rocks.

Relative abundance of blue-greens is shown to have been positively related to temperature, but not to pH or total-P and to have been negatively associated with light, mixing, NO3, but not with NH4, total N or total N/total P ratio. Both heterocytic and non-heterocytic groups were negatively related to NO3. However, if Cylindrospermopsis species are considered as non-N-2-fixing organisms (only 10% of the filaments carried heterocytes), the lakes could be considered as dominated by non-N-2-fixing populations during most of the years. In this new scenario, non-N-2-fixing were dominant in NO3 (but not NH4) deficient lakes and in both NO3 and NH4 deficient conditions. Assemblages S, S-n, H, M, X-1, as groups of descriptor species of systems having similar features as proposed by Reynolds (1997: Ecology Institute, Oldenburg), were representative of warm, shallow, turbid, enriched and frequently mixed lakes. We propose to move some species from Z (picoplancton of oligotrophic lakes) to X-1 assemblage (nanoplankton of eutrophic lakes) and we comment on Microcystis species of M assemblage from mixed shallow lakes in relation to L-m assemblage of end-summer in temperate lakes. S and S-n assemblages, which comprise species which are good-light antennae, were the best represented group in these generally turbid and shallow lakes.

J	Gibbs, MM; Hickey, CW; Özkundakci, D				Gibbs, Max M.; Hickey, Christopher W.; Oezkundakci, Deniz			Sustainability assessment and comparison of efficacy of four P-inactivation agents for managing internal phosphorus loads in lakes: sediment incubations	HYDROBIOLOGIA												A novel application of a continuous flow incubation system (CFIS) was used to assess four phosphorus (P) inactivation agents-alum, Phoslock (TM), a new modified zeolite (Z2G1 or Aqual-P (TM)), and allophone-when used as sediment capping agents to manage internal P loads in lakes. The CFIS technique allowed combined efficacy and sustainability assessment, including: (1) flux measurements during simulation of stratified (anoxic) and mixed (aerobic) conditions on the same sediment through multiple cycles to assess the longevity of a range of product doses; (2) simulation of a summer algal bloom collapse and subsequent burial of the products; and (3) investigation of non-target effects on nitrification and denitrification processes at the sediment-water interface. Minimum P-removal dose rates were found to differ substantially at 80 g m(-2) for alum, 190 g m(-2) for Z2G1, 220 g m(-2) for allophane and 280 g m(-2) for Phoslock (TM), for similar capping layer thickness of about 2 mm, and would be effective for at least 4 years. All products temporarily suppressed nitrification and denitrification under aerobic conditions, and it may be important to minimise product application to any permanently aerobic zones, such as the littoral areas of a lake. While the aluminium (Al)-based products did not enhance Al fluxes in the CFIS, lanthanum (La) was released at a near constant rate of around 2 mg La m(-2) day(-1) from the Phoslock (TM) treatments over a period of at least 14 days. Spatial variability of sediment P, bioturbation, and burial are factors that will affect up-scaling these results to a whole lake.					; Hickey, Christopher/E-9931-2013; Özkundakci, Deniz/B-2796-2009	Ozkundakci, Deniz/0000-0002-5442-4576; HICKEY, CHRISTOPHER/0000-0002-2305-1009; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN	2011	658	1					253	275		10.1007/s10750-010-0477-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-010-0477-3													WOS:000284598200022

(Trin. ex Steudel) periphyton from Lake Velencei were studied by cultivation-based and metabolic fingerprinting methods. Serially diluted spring biofilm samples were used to test the community-level physiological profiling (CLPP) using BIOLOG microplates, and for plating onto different media. On the basis of their morphological, biochemical, and physiological test results, 173 strains were clustered by numerical analysis. Representatives of amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) groups were identified by their 16S rDNA sequence comparison. Based on the results of the CLPP investigations, regional differences were detected among the utilized substrate numbers and types, parallel with the increase in incubation time. The phenotypic test results of the strains showed considerable variability with respect to the sampling sites and the media used for cultivation. The most frequently isolated strains were identified as members of genera Agrobacterium, Pseudomonas (P. anguilliseptica, P. marginalis, P. alcaligenes, P. fragi) with aerobic or facultative anaerobic respiratory metabolism, and the species Aeromonas sobria and A. veronii with strong facultative fermentative metabolism. Other strains were identified as Gram-positive Arthrobacter, Bacillus, and Kocuria species. The rarely isolated strains were members of beta-Proteobacteria (Acidovorax, Delftia, Hydrogenophaga, and Rhodoferax), gamma-Proteobacteria (Psychrobacter and Shewanella), low G + C Gram-positives (Brevibacillus, Paenibacillus, and Exiguobacterium) and high G + C Gram-positives (Aureobacterium and Microbacterium).

J	Zini, L; Calligaris, C; Cucchi, F				Zini, Luca; Calligaris, Chiara; Cucchi, Franco			Geological Field Trips and Maps	GEOLOGICAL FIELD TRIPS AND MAPS												Almost 200 years after the first studies on the Timavo River, researchers are still carrying out their investigations, thanks in part to European projects, aiming to improve the knowledge on the Reka/Timavo cross-border aquifer in order to protect the groundwater resource through quantitative and qualitative monitoring of the underground waters. The Classical Karst Region is, in fact, home to what is generically called the underground Timavo network, a set of underground drainage paths developed well below sea level. The waters flow both in large conduits and in small fractures characterizing the rock mass. Water is the engine that created all these hypogean features and the surface karst morphotypes thanks to the chemical (dissolution) and physical (erosion) processes. The topographical surface is studded with thousands of dolines. Throughout the territory, more than 5.000 caves have been explored, of which more than 150 have a development exceeding a hundred meters. Out of all of them, only less than a dozen reach the water base level (Timavo caves) and others are crossed by water during floods. In this framework is the field trip proposed in the guide book designed as an accompaniment for visitors and participants in the 90 degrees SGI Congress. The excursion goes along the underground path of the Reka/Timavo River, starting from Slovenia, visiting the Skocjan caves in which the river disappears underground (UNESCO world heritage site since 1986). The excursion moves on to the Grotta Gigante cave with another stop at the surface dissolution laboratory and the museum, after which visitors will take part in the excellent sightseeing to be found at Doberdo Lake and at the Timavo Springs where freshwaters meet the salty Adriatic Sea.

The modeled and observed response of Lake Spokane hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen concentrations to phosphorus inputs	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Lake Spokane, a reservoir in eastern Washington State, was previously hypereutrophic due to phosphorus discharges from the City of Spokane wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). This reservoir subsequently recovered to a meso-oligotrophic state after implementation of advanced phosphorus removal. The present study tested whether the mechanistic Lake Spokane water quality (WQ) model realistically represents the sensitivity of this reservoir's hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations to phosphorus inputs. We compared the observed relationship between the mean summer input total phosphorus concentration (TPIN) and the minimum volume weighted hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen concentration (DOMIN) to model values for conditions ranging from hypereutrophic to oligotrophic. Prior to advanced phosphorus removal, TPIN and DOMIN averaged 86 +/- 37 (SD) mu g/L and 1.4 +/- 1.3 mg/L, respectively. Currently (2010-2014), these values average 14 +/- 3 mu g/L and 6.5 +/- 0.8 mg/L, respectively. By contrast, the model's DOMIN response for similar TPIN concentrations was much less pronounced, with hypereutrophic and contemporary DOMIN averaging 3.8 +/- 0.4 and 4.7 +/- 0.04 mg/L, respectively. The model also has a structural DO deficit (saturated DO - DOMIN) of 5.3 mg/L that was evident when all TP INputs to the reservoir were set to zero. Similarly, when all WWTP effluent sources were set to TPEFF = 0 mu g/L, the reservoir epilimnetic TP concentrations were approximate to 8 mu g/L higher than the Spokane River inputs. The water quality model indicates that even if effluent phosphorus concentrations are reduced to zero, the dissolved oxygen goals for Lake Spokane cannot be met.

Thiocapsa imhoffii, sp nov., an alkaliphilic purple sulfur bacterium of the family Chromatiaceae from Soap Lake, Washington (USA)	ARCHIVES OF MICROBIOLOGY												An alkaliphilic purple sulfur bacterium, strain SC5, was isolated from Soap Lake, a soda lake located in east central Washington state (USA). Cells of strain SC5 were gram-negative, non-motile, and non-gas vesiculate cocci, often observed in pairs or tetrads. In the presence of sulfide, elemental sulfur was deposited internally. Liquid cultures were pink to rose red in color. Cells contained bacteriochlorophyll a and spirilloxanthin as major photosynthetic pigments. Internal photosynthetic membranes were of the vesicular type. Optimal growth of strain SC5 occurred in the absence of NaCl (range 0-4%), pH 8.5 (range pH 7.5-9.5), and 32 degrees C. Photoheterotrophic growth occurred in the presence of sulfide or thiosulfate with only a limited number of organic carbon sources. Growth factors were not required, and cells could fix N-2. Dark, microaerobic growth occurred in the presence of both an organic carbon source and thiosulfate. Sulfide and thiosulfate served as electron donors for photoautotrophy, which required elevated levels of CO2. Phylogenetic analysis placed strain SC5 basal to the clade of the genus Thiocapsa in the family Chromatiaceae with a 96.7% sequence similarity to its closest relative, Thiocapsa roseopersicina strain 1711(T) (DSM217(T)). The unique assemblage of physiological and phylogenetic properties of strain SC5 defines it as a new species of the genus Thiocapsa, and we describe strain SC5 herein as Tca. imhoffii, sp. nov.																			0302-8933	1432-072X				DEC	2007	188	6					665	675		10.1007/s00203-007-0287-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00203-007-0287-9								17661016					WOS:000251407500012
J	Kepner, RL Jr; Wharton, RA Jr; Collier, RD; Cockell, CS; Jeffrey, WH				Kepner, RL Jr; Wharton, RA Jr; Collier, RD; Cockell, CS; Jeffrey, WH			UV radiation and potential biological effects beneath the perennial ice cover of an antarctic lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												High-resolution spectral scans of solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) were obtained directly beneath the 4.0-5.0 m thick, perennial ice cover of Lake Hoare, South Victoria Land, Antarctica. Both UVA (320-400 nm) and WE (280-320 nm) radiation were detectable beneath the ice using a diver-deployed, underwater scanning spectroradiometer which permitted accurate measurement in the 280-340 nm range, while avoiding effects of surface shading and/or hole effects. UVR at wavelengths <310 nm was not detectable below the ice. This lower wavelength UVB appears to penetrate the Lake Hoare ice to depths of no more than 1.5 m during relatively cloud-free austral summer days. Based upon estimated biologically effective WR dosages and DNA dosimeter data, exposure of benthic and planktonic microbes to the UVR encountered immediately beneath the ice is unlikely to inhibit microbial metabolism. Although waters of oligotrophic antarctic lakes are highly transparent to UVR, the thick, high scattering and optically dense ice covers on many of these lakes offers organisms a degree of protection largely unavailable in temperate and tropical systems. Thinning or complete loss of these overlying ice covers is likely to have major consequences for the structure of antarctic lake microbial communities.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN 1	2000	427	1-3					155	165		10.1023/A:1003915227163	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003915227163													WOS:000088580100015
J	Lin, CYC; Jacob, DJ; Fiore, AM				Lin, CYC; Jacob, DJ; Fiore, AM			Trends in exceedances of the ozone air quality standard in the continental United States, 1980-1998	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												In 1997, the United States National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone was revised from a l-h average of 0.12 parts per million (ppm) to an 8-h average of 0.08 ppm. Analysis of ozone data for the ensemble of the contiguous United States and for the period 1980-1998 shows that the average number of summer days per year in exceedance of the new standard is in the range 8-24 in the Northeast and in Texas, and 12-73 in southern California. The probability of exceedance increases with temperature and exceeds 20% in the Northeast for daily maximum temperatures above 305 K. We present the results of several different approaches to analyzing the long-term trends in the old and new standards over the continental United States from 1980 to 1998. Daily temperature data are used to resolve meteorological variability and isolate the effects of changes in anthropogenic emissions. Significant negative trends are found in the Northeast urban corridor, in the Los Angeles Basin and on the western bank of Lake Michigan. Temperature segregation enhances the detection of negative trends. Positive trends occur at isolated sites, mostly in the Southeast; a strong positive trend is found in Nashville (Tennessee). There is some evidence that, except in the Southwest, air quality improvements from the 1980s to the 1990s have leveled off in the past decade. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	VANBUSKIRK, J				VANBUSKIRK, J			POPULATION CONSEQUENCES OF LARVAL CROWDING IN THE DRAGONFLY AESHNA-JUNCEA	ECOLOGY												I studied sources of density dependence in a dragonfly population to reveal how population size is controlled. Larvae of the dragonfly Aeshna juncea, inhabiting rock pools on the Lake Superior shoreline at Isle Royale, Michigan, USA, showed clear evidence of competition when natural densities were high. After 2 yr of larval growth, individuals in crowded pools were developmentally delayed and survived less well than individuals in sparsely populated pools. The stunted larvae caught up with individuals in less crowded pools and reached the final instar in sufficient time to emerge in the summer of their 3rd yr, but even so their final body size remained relatively small. A 5-wk field experiment in natural pools demonstrated the causal connection between density and fitness: feeding activity and growth rates were significantly reduced under crowded conditions, but survival showed no response to density. In unmanipulated rock pools, however, natural increases in density from one year to the next were met with slightly overcompensatory decreases in annual survival. The results illustrate that density dependence operates in a way that could contribute to population regulation in A. juncea, and a 6-yr time series from one of the two study areas showed significant evidence for density-dependent dynamics.

JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus, an ancient and parasitic agnathan fish native to the North Atlantic, invaded the Laurentian Great Lakes approximately a century ago triggering its fisheries to collapse. Presently, this species is held in check through a toxicant-based control programme directed by a bi-national treaty organization that seeks to develop a more broadly based integrated pest management (IPM) strategy. After a long and difficult search, the most active components of a migratory pheromone for the sea lamprey were identified and synthesized. This pheromone has remarkable potency and considerable potential to enhance various control strategies that fall within an IPM scheme. The pheromone is comprised of a mixture of at least three sulphated steroids: petromyzonamine disulphate (PADS), petromyzosterol disulphate (PSDS) and petromyzonol sulphate (PS). A steroidal sex pheromone appears to have similar promise. These discoveries, which are prompting development of the first pheromonally guided pest management programme for an invasive fish, have revealed significant scientific and policy challenges. Among the former are the needs to acquire long-term and significant support for the science, to synthesize sufficient quantities of cues, and to deploy and measure pheromonal components in natural waters. Among the latter are the needs to regulate this new type of 'pesticide', protect these technologies from exploitation and promote future research on this and other invasive fish species. Lessons from these experiences may be applicable to the study of other invasive fishes. (c) 2007 The Authors Journal compilation (c) 2007 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.

Geoheritage Resource of Small Mud Lakes in the Semi-Arid Environments of the Russian South	RESOURCES-BASEL												Lakes constitute a significant freshwater resource and are often regarded as being an important part of a country's natural heritage. However, their geological heritage (geoheritage) value remains significantly understudied. Three small lakes, namely the Salt Lake, the Gruzskoe Lake and the Big Yashalta Lake, located in the central part of the Russian South were studied in this paper. The main focus of this research was to search for relevant unique geological features. This paper established that these lakes are distinguishable from other lakes by the presence of dark-colored mud that is rich in sulfides and methane. As a result of excessive summer evaporation, the lakes desiccate (partly or even fully) and this results in exposure of the mud as well as the formation of salt crystals and crusts. This bottom mud (peloid, therapeutic mud) forms as a result of highly-complex biogeochemical processes in semi-arid environments. This mud is interpreted as being part of the lake's geoheritage as it belongs to sedimentary, geochemical and other types. Moreover, this geoheritage has a high ranking nationally. The most representative example can be found at the Big Yashalta Lake and for that reason, this lake is proposed as a geosite. Established sites of geoheritage importance are vital to geoscience research and geotourism activities and thus, these sites are considered to be a resource. Together with the development of local ecotourism and the use of peloids for the health industry purposes, the exploitation of this geoheritage resource would contribute to the sustainable development of the local area.

From images and associated data, this contribution proposes a holistic interpretation of depositional regime, diagenesis and burial history. A lake basin probably received sediment pulses from alluvial fans. Bed cross-sections show millimetre to centimetre-scale layering due to distal pulses of fluvial sediment injections (fine-grained hyperpycnites), fall-out from river plumes, and some aeolian supply. Diagenetic features include mineralized synaeresis cracks and millimetre-scale nodules, as well as stratiform cementation. Clay minerals were initially considered due to insitu alteration, but bulk rock chemistry and mineralogy suggests that sediments were derived from variably weathered source rocks that probably contained pre-existing clay minerals. X-ray diffraction analyses show contrasting clay mineralogy in closely spaced samples, consistent with at least partial detrital supply of clay minerals. A significant (ca 30 wt%) amorphous component is consistent with little post-depositional alteration. Theoretical modelling of diagenetic reactions, as well as kinetic considerations, suggest that the bulk of diagenetic clay mineral formation occurred comparatively late in diagenesis. Diagenetic features (synaeresis cracks and nodules) were previously thought to reflect early diagenetic gas formation, but an alternative scenario of synaeresis crack formation via fabric collapse of flocculated clays appears more likely. The observed diagenetic features, such as solid nodules, hollow nodules, matrix cement and raised ridges' (synaeresis cracks) can be explained with progressive alteration of olivine/glass in conjunction with centrifugal and counter diffusion of reactive species. Anhydrite-filled fractures in the Sheepbed mudstone occurred late in diagenesis when fluid pressures built up to exceed lithostatic pressure. Generating fluid overpressure by burial to facilitate hydraulic fracturing suggests a burial depth of at least 1000m for the underlying strata that supplied these fluids.					; Coleman, Max/A-1303-2007; Bish, David/AAY-7618-2020; Gupta, Sanjeev/JUF-5203-2023	Edgett, Kenneth/0000-0001-7197-5751; Gupta, Sanjeev/0000-0001-6415-1332													0037-0746	1365-3091				FEB	2017	64	2					311	358		10.1111/sed.12318	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/sed.12318													WOS:000393889400001

Italy): application of massless markers transported in 3D motion fields	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												This study, conducted using the TRIM_LM model, is a continuation of work on the movement of the water mass at different depths in Lago Maggiore, and thus on the estimation of the real residence time of the water in the lake. Three-dimensional CFD numerical simulations were extended to a 4-year period, focusing on the movements of 202 (two hundred and two) massless markers inserted at different points in Logo Maggiore and at the mouths of 11 of its tributaries, enabling us to establish more realistic water renewal times for Logo Maggiore. By crossing the data of the horizontal trajectories of the environmental markers with those of their vertical variations, we reconstructed their movements over the four years of the simulation programme. An analysis of the results shows that the water mass in the layers of the upper 100 in has residence times between a minimum of 1 y and a maximum of 4-5 y. The water from the tributaries has residence times between 250 and 1000 days, depending on the distance of the tributaries from the closing section of the lake. The water in the layers below 100 in has residence times that still cannot be quantified with precision, but that can certainly be estimated at a number of years in two figures. These times are strongly conditioned by the depth of the late winter mixing, which in the last 40 y has not exceeded 200 m.

The surface energy balance and glacier frontal variations have been monitored for several years, using automatic weather stations and satellite imagery. In recent field campaigns, surface topography was measured using Javad GPS receivers. Daily changes in snow-, ice- and tephra-covered areas were recorded using an automatic digital camera installed on a rock outcrop. In spite of frequently damaging weather conditions, two series of consecutive images were obtained, in 2006 and 2007. These photographs were georeferenced to a resampled 90 m pixel size SRTM digital elevation model and the reflectance values normalized according to several geometric and atmospheric parameters. The resulting daily maps of surface albedo are used as input to a distributed glacier-melt model during a 12 day mid-summer period. The spatial pattern of cumulative melt is complex and controlled by the distribution of airfall and wind-blown tephra, with extremely high melt rates occurring downwind of the crater and exposed ash banks. The camera images are also used to visualize the pattern A of glacier crevassing. The results demonstrate the value of terrestrial photography in understanding the energy and mass balance of the glacier, including the generation of meltwater, and the potential value of the technique for monitoring volcanic activity and potential hazards associated with ice-volcano A interactions during eruptive activity.					; Brock, Benjamin/D-9976-2016	Rivera, Andres/0000-0002-2779-4192; Brock, Benjamin/0000-0002-5377-0776													0022-1430	1727-5652					2008	54	188					920	930		10.3189/002214308787780076	http://dx.doi.org/10.3189/002214308787780076													WOS:000264036800015
J	Bergmaier, PT; Geerts, B				Bergmaier, Philip T.; Geerts, Bart			LLAP Band Structure and Intense Lake-Effect Snowfall Downwind of Lake Ontario: Insights from the OWLeS 7-9 January 2014 Event	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												Modeling and observational studies stemming from the 2013-14 Ontario Winter Lake-Effect Systems (OWLeS) field campaign have yielded much insight into the structure and development of long-lake-axis-parallel (LLAP) lake-effect systems over Lake Ontario. This study uses airborne single- and dual-Doppler radar data obtained during two University of Wyoming King Air flights, as well as a high-resolution numerical model simulation, to examine and contrast two distinctly different LLAP band structures observed within a highly persistent lake-effect system on 7-9 January 2014. On 7 January, a very cold air mass accompanied by strong westerly winds and weak capping aloft resulted in a deep, intense LLAP band that produced heavy snowfall well inland. In contrast, weaker winds, weaker surface heat fluxes, and stronger capping aloft resulted in a weaker LLAP band on 9 January. This band was blocked along the downwind shore and produced only light snowfall closer to the shoreline. Although the two structures examined here represent opposite ends of a spectrum of LLAP bands, both cases reveal a well-organized mesoscale secondary circulation composed of two counterrotating horizontal vortices positioned on either side of a narrow updraft within the band. In both cases, this circulation traces back to a shallow, baroclinic land-breeze front originating along a bulge in the lake's southern shoreline. As the band extends downstream and the low-level baroclinity weakens, buoyancy increases within the band-driven in part by cloud latent heating-leading to band intensification and a deeper, stronger, and more symmetric secondary circulation over the lake.					; Geerts, Bart/H-7570-2017	Bergmaier, Philip/0000-0002-9389-9646; Geerts, Bart/0000-0002-1508-6121													1558-8424	1558-8432				OCT	2020	59	10					1691	1715		10.1175/JAMC-D-19-0288.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JAMC-D-19-0288.1													WOS:000589968400008

Phytoplankton response to the environmental and climatic variability in a temperate lake over the last 14,500 years in eastern Latvia	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Phytoplankton species are the primary producers in lakes and play important roles in food-web structures. Any shift in their diversity and productivity has an impact on other aquatic life forms. We use a range of environmental variables to explore the possible drivers influencing phytoplankton composition over the last 14,500 years in a temperate lake Lielais SvA"tiA dagger u, eastern Latvia. Using pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs, temperature reconstructions and lithological information as proxies of environmental factors, we statistically test their associations with the fossil phytoplankton community composition. Our results reveal that during the Late Glacial, the climate warming, the decrease in landscape openness, and increase in organic matter were significant environmental variables affecting dynamics of phytoplankton communities , especially in the prevalence of Botryococcus, Tetraedron, Scenedesmus and Pediastrum. According to the Redundancy Analysis and Generalized Least Squares models, Pediastrum, Scenedesmus and Tetraedron were positively associated with waterlogging tolerance that indicates moist soils in surroundings of the lake, during the Early Holocene. The 8.2 ka cold event with a 2-3 A degrees C cooling led to a strong environmental disturbance for nearly 700 years, indicated by an increased chlorophyta accumulation rates and a decrease in the organic matter. Our results indicate that Coelastrum reticulatum and C. polychordum are characteristic for the 8.2 ka cold event. Positive association between cyanobacteria and mean air summer temperature suggests that a warming favoured cyanobacteria over other phytoplankton taxa between 8000 and 4000 cal yr BP. High nutrient loads and water turbidity were more important for the dynamics of cyanobacteria from 4000 to 2000 cal yr BP. Human-driven trophic level change was recorded in the last 2000 years by abundances of fungi Sporormiella and Sordaria, and by the peaks of Gloeotrichia pisum, C. reticulatum and C. polychordum indicating eutrophication.

Postglacial sediment budget of Chilliwack Valley, British Columbia	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												The paraglacial reworking of glacial sediments by rivers and mass wasting is an important conditioning factor for modern sediment yields in mountainous catchments in formerly glaciated regions. Catchment scale and patterns of sediment storage are important influences in the rate of postglacial adjustment. We develop a quantitative framework to estimate the volume, sediment type, and fractional size distribution of legacy glacial materials in a large (1230?km2) watershed in the North Cascade Mountains in south-western British Columbia, Canada. Chilliwack Valley is exceptional because of the well-dated bounds of deglaciation. Interpolation of paleo-surfaces from partially eroded deposits in the valley allows us to estimate the total evacuated sediment volume. We present a chronology of sediment evacuation from the valley and deposition in the outlet fan, based on infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL) and 14?C dating of river terraces and fan strata, respectively. The effects of paraglacial sedimentation in Chilliwack Valley were intensified through a major fall in valley base-level following ice retreat. The steepened mainstem valley gradient led to deep incision of valley fills and fan deposits in the lower valley network. The results of this integrated study provide a postglacial chronology and detailed sediment budget, accounting for long-term sorting of the original sediments, lag deposit formation in the mainstem, deposition in the outlet fan, and approximate downstream losses of suspended sediment and wash load. The mass balance indicates that a bulk volume of approximately 3.2?km3 of glacial material has been evacuated from the valley. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Wagrowski, DM; Hites, RA				Wagrowski, DM; Hites, RA			Insights into the global distribution of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans were measured in 63 pairs of tree bark and soil samples. Maps of lipid-adjusted concentrations in bark and fluxes to soil indicated that Vancouver Island, the Midwestern United States, Germany, and Hong Kong were areas of high PCDD/F deposition. Concentrations and fluxes in the regions north of the 60th parallel, particularly the Canadian Arctic, were low, indicating that PCDD/F do not move appreciably from warm to cold latitudes. Linear regressions of the PCDD/F concentrations in tree bark versus fluxes to soil showed that total concentrations in bark can be used to estimate total fluxes to soil ina particular region. Comparison of the homologue profiles for each pair of bark and soil samples indicated that the pairs fell into three categories: 1. bark and soil both resembled source profiles; 2. bark and soil both resembled sink profiles; and 3. bark resembled a source profile but the soil resembled a sink profile. This variation in homologue profiles may be due to the proximity of sampling locations to sources. We found that anthropogenic NO, emissions are highly correlated to PCDD/F soil fluxes, and we used this regression to estimate global PCDD/F fluxes to soil on the same spatial scale as the NO, data. Multiplying these fluxes by the corresponding land areas, we estimated that total PCDD/F deposition to the earth's land surface is about 2-15 t/yr.

Lakes ranged in size from 2 to 255 hectare surface area, mean depths from 0.2 to 0.9 meters, and mean water exchange times from 0.5 to almost 57 hours. The benthos of these lakes has been dominated by four taxa: Sphaeriidae, Hexagenia sp, Chironomidae, and Oligochaeta. Populations of Sphaeriidae during the mid-1970's showed substantial between-lake variations, but differences between years were not significant (p > 0.05). By the 1989-91 period there had been a significant (p < 0.05) overall decline in Sphaeriidae populations from these lakes. By the 1989-91 period the early summer populations of Sphaeriidae declined to only about 9 percent of their mid-1970 levels, which accounted for most of the 38 percent decline in total benthic population size. Anaerobic conditions near the bottom waters of one lake (Green Lake) could account for the decline and disappearance of Sphaeriidae; this lake has also lost its Hexagenia populations. The more widespread decline in fingernail clams from the other lakes, and reports of declines from other sections of the river, are not adequately explained.																			0270-5060					DEC	1991	6	4					353	361		10.1080/02705060.1991.9665315	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1991.9665315													WOS:A1991GX79700002
J	Hilberg, S; Riepler, F				Hilberg, Sylke; Riepler, Franz			Interaction of various flow systems in small alpine catchments: conceptual model of the upper Gurk Valley aquifer, Carinthia, Austria	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Small alpine valleys usually show a heterogeneous hydraulic situation. Recurring landslides create temporal barriers for the surface runoff. As a result of these postglacial processes, temporal lakes form, and thus lacustrine fine-grained sedimentation intercalates with alluvial coarse-grained layers. A sequence of alluvial sediments (confined and thus well protected aquifers) and lacustrine sediments (aquitards) is characteristic for such an environment. The hydrogeological situation of fractured hard-rock aquifers in the framing mountain ranges is characterized by superficially high hydraulic conductivities as the result of tectonic processes, deglaciation and postglacial weathering. Fracture permeability and high hydraulic gradients in small-scaled alpine catchments result in the interaction of various flow systems in various kinds of aquifers. Spatial restrictions and conflicts between the current land use and the requirements of drinking-water protection represent a special challenge for water resource management in usually densely populated small alpine valleys. The presented case study describes hydrogeological investigations within the small alpine valley of the upper Gurktal (Upper Carinthia, Austria) and the adjacent Hollenberg Massif (1,772 m above sea level). Hydrogeological mapping, drilling, and hydrochemical and stable isotope analyses of springs and groundwater were conducted to identify a sustainable drinking-water supply for approximately 1,500 inhabitants. The results contribute to a conceptual hydrogeological model with three interacting flow systems. The local and the intermediate flow systems are assigned to the catchment of the Hollenberg Massif, whereas the regional flow system refers to the bordering Gurktal Alps to the north and provides an appropriate drinking water reservoir.					; Hilberg, Sylke/KHW-4383-2024	Hilberg, Sylke/0000-0002-6570-7977; 													1431-2174	1435-0157				AUG	2016	24	5					1231	1244		10.1007/s10040-016-1396-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-016-1396-9													WOS:000380090000012
J	Yang, JW; Liu, CY; Shu, R; Xie, F				Yang Jia-wei; Liu Cheng-yu; Shu Rong; Xie Feng			Suitability Analysis of Water Body Spectral Index in Urban River Network	SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS												Urban surface water is an important part of urban ecological environment. Hyperspectral remote sensing of surface water environment is an important application direction of hyperspectral remote sensing. Water extraction is the first step of hyperspectral remote sensing of surface water environment. Its main task is to obtain the contour of the surface water body from hyperspectral remote sensing data. The water body spectral index makes full use of the spectral information, and the calculation is simple, the implementation is easy, and the extraction effect is excellent. Spectral indices such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI) hyperspectral difference water index (HDWI) and index of water index (IWI) have been widely used in the extraction of open water bodies such as lakes and large rivers. In recent years, with the development of imaging spectroscopy technology, the acquisition capability of hyperspectral remote sensing data has also advanced rapidly, and spatial resolution and spectral resolution have been continuously improved. The rivers and lakes are basically distributed along the topography in the basin while the urban surface water is generally small, criss-crossed, forming a river network. When hyperspectral remote sensing data are used for urban surface water extraction, the spatial resolution of the image, the type of features and the complexity of the ground objects are very different from those of rivers and lakes. Therefore, the applicability of these commonly used spectral indices in urban surface water extraction needs to be evaluated. This article is based on this starting point and goal, taking the Jiaxing City, Zhejiang Province in China, which is in Jiangnan Water Town and has a dense river network as the research object, and using the high spatial resolution airborne hyperspectral remote sensing data acquired by airborne imaging spectrometer for applications (AISA) as data source. The optimal threshold is determined by Youden index. The overall accuracy, commission error, omission error and Kappa coefficient are used as the accuracy evaluation indicators. The suitability of NDVI, NDWI, HDWI and IWI in urban river network extraction was analyzed and evaluated. The results show that the trend of the shadow spectrum is similar to the water spectrum, and is the main factor causing high commission errors in the water body extraction. All four indices accurately suppress the shadows that fall in the vegetation, but do not effectively suppress the shadows that fall in the buildings. Although HDWI can suppress shadows cast in buildings to a certain extent, it cannot effectively suppress the bright buildings. Through further analysis of the spectrum of different types of water bodies and (the ground objects under) shadows, the water and shadow spectral curves are similar, and there are peaks around 560 similar to 600 nm, but the heights of water and shadow peaks are different. The water wave peaks are larger while the peak value of the shadow wave is lower. Therefore, by fully excavating the spectrum reflectance information at 560 similar to 600 nm in water bodies and shadows, it is expected to further suppress building shadows and improve the accuracy of water extraction in urban river networks.

Special attention was paid to the ellipsoid, concentrically laminated carbonate concrements (oncoids) of 6-22 cm length. The cover of living algae was studied by light microscopy to view handsections. The microstructure of carbonates was studied from epoxy-resin cast cross-sections of the oncoids. In the fresh material, the top stratum of carbonate consists of a 0.1-0.2 mm solid, dark blue-green layer, which was formed by cyanophytes. This layer was frequently covered by a thinner, non-calcified brown layer dominated by diatoms. In the resin-cast cross-sections, unlaminated micrite structures attributed to the dominant algae, Homoeothrix crustacea and Schizothrix fasciculata, are found in the top layer. Radiating Rivularia-type calcite structures occur only in layers below 4-5 mm. The extent to which this variation in oncoid structure can be attributed to changes in environmental conditions is discussed. Relative dating of concentric layers of three oncoids was made by the Pb-210 method in order to estimate mean annual deposition rates.																			0003-9136					DEC	1991				92			469	482																WOS:A1991HW77700035

This disruption to the disturbance regime is an example of how climate extremes can exacerbate current and future wildfire risks. In this study, we used data from an extensive network of forest plots across 13 different sites in the Sierra Nevada to characterize ground (i.e., duff) and surface fuels and their potential drivers shortly after the drought (2016-2018), but before snag (standing dead tree) fall associated with this massive tree mortality event occurred. Overall, we found high biomass of fuels for most sites (138.2 +/- 21.7 Mg ha-1, Mean +/- 95 % CI), especially in areas lacking recent fire or active management, with values up to five times higher than estimates for pre-settlement conditions for mixed-conifer forests in the region. Four major groups of forest overstory structure were identified with some distinct fuel characteristics. These ranged from a cluster of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Douglas ex Lawson)-dominated plots with the highest density of snags, lowest live tree basal area, and lowest total ground and surface fuel biomass (mean = 90.1 Mg ha-1) to a group of giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum (Lindl.) J. Buchholz)-dominated plots with the highest live tree basal area and highest total fuel biomass (mean = 547.6 Mg ha-1). Although we found relatively weak relationships between forest characteristics and fuel loads, their inclusion in a model selection framework that also considered biophysical variables and disturbance history explained>80 % of the observed variation in litter + fine woody debris loads. The baseline fuel conditions described here will not only inform the management of drought-impacted forests in the Sierra Nevada, but also help identify key drivers of fuel succession in a changing environment.

Mike; Freyberg, David; Sharma, Om Prakash; Sharma, Anupma			Estimating aquifer recharge in fractured hard rock: analysis of the methodological challenges and application to obtain a water balance (Jaisamand Lake Basin, India)	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Groundwater recharge is an important metric for sustainable water management, particularly in semi-arid regions. Hard-rock aquifers underlie two-thirds of India and appropriate techniques for estimating groundwater recharge are needed, but the accuracy of such values is highly uncertain. The chloride mass balance (CMB) method was employed to estimate annual groundwater recharge rates in a monsoon-dependent area of Jaisamand Lake basin in Rajasthan, which contains the Gangeshwar watershed. A monitoring program was established within the watershed during summer 2009, with local participation for the collection of rainfall and groundwater samples. Groundwater recharge was estimated spatially over a 3-year period with pre-monsoon and post-monsoon datasets. Recharge rates estimated using the CMB method were then compared to those estimated using the water-table fluctuation (WTF) method. Specific yield was 0.63 % and assumed to be homogenous across the watershed. The average recharge rate derived from the WTF method (31 mm/year) was higher than that derived from the CMB method (24.3 mm/year). CMB recharge rates were also applied to obtain a water balance for the watershed. CMB recharge rates were used to estimate annual groundwater replenishment and were compared with estimates of groundwater withdrawal using Landsat imagery. Over the 2009-2011 study period, groundwater demand was about seven times greater than the estimated groundwater renewal of 5.6 million cubic meters. This analysis highlights the challenges associated with estimating groundwater recharge in fractured hard-rock aquifers, and how renewable groundwater-resource estimates can be used as a metric to promote sustainable water use.

J	Nirupama, N; Maula, A				Nirupama, N.; Maula, Amanda			Engaging public for building resilient communities to reduce disaster impact	NATURAL HAZARDS												Perception about people's behaviour during emergencies defines, to a large extent, the course of planning and resource allocation for community emergency response as well as development of mitigation measures. During the past decade, there has been a paradigm shift in the approach to disaster management. A recent trend has been to encourage more community participation as opposed to the top-down approach of the past. It is believed that community participation will bring about a comprehensive and accurate appreciation of people's perception regarding hazards, risk, vulnerability, and resilience, and this research is an attempt to achieve just that. In order to accomplish our goal, we engaged a group of women that would typically fall into the category of "vulnerable group" in a focus group interview setting. The participants were mainly over 40 years old, the majority with little education, unemployed, facing language barriers, of low income, and reliant on public transit. Many participants identified that they lived in the vicinity of rivers, lakes, railways, or power plants, but did not seem to be aware of their exposure to potential threats-indicating a lack of education and awareness. The most common hazards and mitigation measures they were aware of, included floods (including basement flooding), fire, fire alarm, and smoke detectors. Additionally, illness and loneliness were mentioned as factors contributing to their increased vulnerability, hence reduced resiliency. With the help of the focus group members' participation, we were able to discuss the importance of communities being aware of their surroundings, available resources and help, and permit them to voice their concerns in order to be able to cope during emergencies. We trust and hope that more community participation will lead to stronger and more resilient cities.

We analyzed data from 782 lake years in different climate zones in North America, South America, and Europe. We tested if systematic differences exist in the relationship between the abundance of submerged macrophytes and environmental factors such as lake depth and nutrient levels. In the pooled dataset the proportion of lakes with substantial submerged macrophyte coverage (> 30% of the lake area) decreased in a sigmoidal way with increasing total phosphorus (TP) concentration, falling most steeply between 0.05 and 0.2 mg L-1. Substantial submerged macrophyte coverage was also rare in lakes with total nitrogen (TN) concentrations above 1-2 mg L-1, except for lakes with very low TP concentrations where macrophytes remain abundant until higher TN concentrations. The deviance reduction of logistic regression models predicting macrophyte coverage from nutrients and water depth was generally low, and notably lowest in tropical and subtropical regions (Brazil, Uruguay, and Florida), suggesting that macrophyte coverage was strongly influenced by other factors. The maximum TP concentration allowing substantial submerged macrophyte coverage was clearly higher in cold regions with more frost days. This is in agreement with other studies which found a large influence of ice cover duration on shallow lakes' ecology through partial fish kills that may improve light conditions for submerged macrophytes by cascading effects on periphyton and phytoplankton. Our findings suggest that, in regions where climatic warming is projected to lead to fewer frost days, macrophyte cover will decrease unless the nutrient levels are lowered.

This approach was tested in the Mas-saciuccoli Lake Basin (Tuscany, Italy), a coastal floodplain artificially drained for agricultural purposessince 1930, where land reclamation and continuous cropping have contributed to considerable peatdegradation and water eutrophication due to nutrient enrichment of surface waters. An experimentaltrial was established in spring 2012 with three perennial rhizomatous grasses (PRG) (Phragmites aus-tralis, Miscanthus X giganteus, Arundo donax) and two woody species managed as short-rotation coppice(SRC) (Salix alba Dimitrios, Populus X canadensis Oudenberg), aimed to provide biomass for variousbioenergy supply chains. A conventionally cultivated annual crop (maize) was the control. The aim of thisstudy was to compare the sustainability of the proposed paludiculture systems to that of conventionalannual crops on the basis of yield and nutrient-removal capability. This two-year field study evaluatedyields, nutrient concentrations and uptake (N and P) of the crops. Over the two years, A. donax had thehighest mean biomass yield (35 Mg ha(-1)), N uptake (367 kg ha(-1)), and P uptake (54 kg ha(-1)). SRCs hadthe lowest nutrient uptake in both years. Among grasses, the highest N concentration was recorded inA. donax leaves in 2013 (N: 2.41%), while P concentration was greater in S. alba branches (P: 0.39%). Theaverage aboveground biomass of maize was 17.5 Mg ha(-1), while the nutrient uptakes were equal to 194and 27 kg ha(-1)for N and P, respectively. Thus, the performances of paludiculture systems were generally encouraging and could represent animportant alternative for restoring and managing former drained peatlands in a suitable product chain.

J	Beltaos, S; Carter, T				Beltaos, Spyros; Carter, Tom			Field studies of ice breakup and jamming in lower Peace River, Canada	COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Since the late 19608, a paucity of ice-jam flooding in the lower Peace River has resulted in prolonged dry periods and considerable reduction in the area covered by lakes and ponds that provide habitat for aquatic life in the Peace-Athabasca Delta region. To help identify the causes of this trend and assess future conditions under a changing climate, a field observation program was conducted during 1999-2003. Limited data were also obtained during a significant event in 2007. This program has furnished the first detailed documentation of ice processes in the lower Peace. Though focusing on the breakup period, relevant antecedent conditions were also documented. Freezeup often involves formation of thickened ice covers, which lead to high freezeup stages and potentially to enhanced growth of the solid-ice layer during the winter. Ice decay prior to breakup can be moderate to severe, and is manifested in saturation and candling. The type of observed breakup ranged from essential melt-out in 2000, to occasional jamming upstream of the delta reach in 2003, and to a moderate delta flood in 2007. The field observations and measurements, including the only ice jam profile that has been measured in the lower Peace, are shown to be consistent with current physical understanding of breakup and jamming processes. The main factors conducive to ice-jam flooding are identified and their relative importance is assessed using physically-based breakup criteria. Breakup patterns are shown to be strongly influenced by the very low slope of the river, which amplifies the importance of waves generated by ice jam releases.

Local records of monsoon strength from cave deposits, ice cores, and lake sediments typically rely on proxy data that relate isotopic variations to changes in precipitation. Lake expansion and contraction in response to changing water balance are likewise inferred from sedimentologic, isotopic and paleobiologic proxies, but relatively few direct records of changes in lake volume from preserved shorelines exist. Here we utilize relict shoreline deposits and associated alluvial fan features around Siling Co, the largest lake in central Tibet, to reconstruct centennial-to-millennial-scale variations in lake area and volume over the Holocene. Mapping and surveying of lacustrine shorelines coupled with optically stimulated luminescence dating of associated deposits indicate protracted occupation of a highstand elevation from >8 ka to 4 ka, followed by rapid recession that was likely punctuated by several stillstands of centennial-scale duration. Calculation of the changes in lake surface area and past hydrologic indices of the Siling Co basin suggests the effective moisture during the early Holocene highstand was approximately three times greater than today. In contrast to other lakes in central and western Tibet, our results suggest that Siling Co did not begin to recede synchronously with decreasing solar insolation at ca. 9-8 ka. Rather, initial recession of Siling Co appears to correspond to a time period of enhanced aridity and weakened monsoon in both Africa and Asia at ca. 4.2ka. Our results add to a growing body of literature that suggest a period of relatively severe aridity on the Tibetan Plateau at this time. We suggest that subsequent punctuated recession of Siling Co was punctuated by similar periods of abrupt climate change during the Late Holocene. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Burk, D; Uhl, D; Walther, H				Burk, D; Uhl, D; Walther, H			Some aspects of the actuotaphonomy of leaves in stagnant ponds with implications for the formation of fossil leaf deposits - preliminary results	NEUES JAHRBUCH FUR GEOLOGIE UND PALAONTOLOGIE-MONATSHEFTE												Investigations on the fate of plant litter entering a column of stagnant water after leaf shedding at the end of the vegetation period have been conducted with the aid of "Biomass Collecting Devices" (BCDs) in four different stagnant ponds near Dresden. The quality and quantity of the plant biomass within an extant leaf litter layer within such a stagnant pond was found to depend mainly on the composition of species and the quantity of individual leaves entering the water column. Our data suggest that leaves deposited within an individual leaf layer were shed almost exclusively from plants surrounding the pond and deposited within a single year. This implies that probably also in fossil layers, which have been deposited in comparable sedimentary environments (e.g. oxbow lakes), leaves originating from deciduous taxa may represent the autumnal leaf fall of an individual year. Based on these observations we interpret a sediment containing such plant bearing layers from the Upper Oligocene (floral assemblage "Thierbach") of the Weisselster Basin (Saxony, Germany) as sediment deposited in stagnant water, comparable to the extant depositional environments examined. Our results show that the use of BCDs has a great potential for further actuotaphonomic studies dealing with the formation of fossil leaf deposits.																			0028-3630					DEC	2005		12					705	728																WOS:000234749300001

R.; Yokoyama, Elder			A fully calibrated and updated mid-Holocene climate reconstruction for Eastern South America	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Investigating the extent and climate implications of the mid-Holocene (MH -around 6000 years ago) is essential in better understanding the uncertainties associated with the ongoing and future projections of global warming. South America (SA) contains the biome with the largest biodiversity in the world, its population exceeds 400 million people, and its economy is mainly agricultural. Thus, studies involving South America's climate variability have become a subject of significant importance over the years. Paleoclimate archives provide unique indirect measurements, helping us to characterize past climates. However, the derived radiometric ages from several paleoarchives in SA published before the 2000s have not yet been calibrated, which represents a large source of uncertainty. In this article, we present a climate reconstruction for eastern SA during the MH with fully calibrated age models. We compiled 173 paleoclimate records, where 50 of them were calibrated in this study using Bayesian methods. Through this multiproxy approach and the elaboration of a new homogeneous quality index for proxies, our novel climate reconstruction sheds new light on the regional climate of SA climate during MH. All high quality (higher than 1) paleoarchives agree at regional scale. Compiled paleodata confirms reduced rainfall in Amazonia and a warmer and drier Southern SA, indicating an overall weakening of the South American Summer Monsoon during the MH. North East Brazil coast show higher than present moisture during the MH, while the border between Northeast Brazil and Southern SA shows divergent behavior, pointing to a local erratic rainfall regime with inputs of higher than present moisture conditions, most likely caused by changes in precipitation over the South Atlantic Convergence Zone, and a weaker than present South Atlantic Subtropical High during MH.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Kong, YL; Pang, ZH; Froehlich, K				Kong, Yanlong; Pang, Zhonghe; Froehlich, Klaus			Quantifying recycled moisture fraction in precipitation of an arid region using deuterium excess	TELLUS SERIES B-CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL METEOROLOGY												Terrestrial moisture recycling by evapotranspiration has recently been recognised as an important source of precipitation that can be characterised by its isotopic composition. Up to now, this isotope technique has mainly been applied to moisture recycling in some humid regions, including Brazil, Great Lakes in North America and the European Alps. In arid and semi-arid regions, the contribution of transpiration by plants to local moisture recycling can be small, so that evaporation by bare soil and surface water bodies dominates. Recognising that the deuterium excess (d-excess) of evaporated moisture is significantly different from that of the original water, we made an attempt to use this isotopic parameter for estimating moisture recycling in the semi-arid region of Eastern Tianshan, China. We measured the d-excess of samples taken from individual precipitation events during a hydrological year from 2003 to 2004 at two Tianshan mountain stations, and we used long-term monthly average values of the d-excess for the station Urumqi, which are available from the International Atomic Energy Agency-World Meteorological Organization (IAEA-WMO) Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation (GNIP). Since apart from recycling of moisture from the ground, sub-cloud evaporation of falling raindrops also affects the d-excess of precipitation, the measured values had to be corrected for this evaporation effect. For the selected stations, the sub-cloud evaporation was found to change between 0.1 and 3.8%, and the d-excess decreased linearly with increasing sub-cloud evaporation at about 1.1 parts per thousand per 1% change of sub-cloud evaporation. Assuming simple mixing between advected and recycled moisture, the recycled fraction in precipitation has been estimated to be less than 2.0 +/- 0.6% for the Tianshan mountain stations and reach values up to 15.0 +/- 0.7% in the Urumqi region. The article includes a discussion of these findings in the context of water cycling in the studied region.

We studied the microbial abundance, activities, and diversity associated with decomposing carcasses of different zooplankton species over short and long time scales, and in oligotrophic vs. eutrophic environments. Fresh carcasses of Daphnia cucullata, Diaphanosoma brachyurum, and Eudiaptomus gracilis were rapidly colonized by bacteria, which reached peak abundances within 1.5 d at 20 degrees C and then decreased. Cell-specific exoenzymatic activity on protein and lipid analogs and production rate of bacteria associated with the carcasses were all higher than in the ambient water. ANOSIM analyses of DGGE banding patterns revealed that bacterial communities associated with both cladoceran and copepod carcasses rapidly diverged from the initial bacterial community in the ambient water. The high similarity of bacteria on both types of carcasses indicates that the carcasses were decomposed by similar bacterial groups. Estimated carcass decomposition rate was lower at 6 degrees C, with an estimated Q(10) of 2.4. Carcasses suspended in the eutrophic Lake Dagow had a higher average carbon loss rate than those suspended in the oligotrophic Lake Stechlin. Cladoceran carcasses were initially colonized by bacteria faster than copepod carcasses in both laboratory and field experiments, suggesting that cladoceran carcasses were more prone to exploitation by bacteria, yet copepod carcasses lost carbon at higher rates. Overall, our results suggest that pelagic zooplankton production can be directly converted to water column bacterial production via carcass decomposition, especially during the mid-summer zooplankton decline commonly observed in lakes.

This study was part of a larger project which aims to analyse the movement of commercially unimportant fish species and reduce the abundance of these fish in L. Jyvasjarvi. Catch samples were collected with a trap net located immediately upstream from the acoustic beams. The most common species in the catch were roach (Rutilus rutilus), perch (Perca fluviatilis), bream (Abramis brama), ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernuus), and white bream (Abramis bjoerkna). The upstream migration of fish was correlated with water temperature (r = 0.40) with time lag of I d. In spring, L. Jyvasjarvi warmed faster than L. Paijanne, causing spawning migration from L. Paijanne to L. Jyvasjarvi. Clear diurnal rhythm in activity was observed. The migration rate through the channel peaked around dawn and dusk. Catch per unit effort of the trap net suggested that the peak of the spawning migration of different species was separate. Upstream migration was induced by the temperature difference between two lakes, and the activity of the migration was regulated by temperature changes and light rhythm.

Climate exerts a significant influence on mechanisms of OC capture, storage, and processing on the wet and cloudy west coast of Ireland. We examined a high-frequency dataset of partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) in the surface waters of Lough Feeagh collected over 1 year. The annual pattern in pCO(2) ranged between 491 and 1169 mu atm and was strongly related to allochthonous riverine OC inputs. In contrast to observations in colder climates, a single peak in pCO(2) occurred in Lough Feeagh in early September. Generalised additive mixed modelling revealed that 2 variables, inflow water colour concentration (a reliable proxy for DOC concentrations) and lake Schmidt stability, together explained 68% of pCO(2) variability. Both the statistical analysis and timing of the peaks in inflow DOC and pCO(2) strongly suggested that catchment carbon export drove pCO(2) supersaturation in the lake, and hence CO2 emissions. We estimated that between 217 and 370 t CO2-C (0.55-0.94 t/ha) was emitted during the study period. These results highlight the interplay between catchment OC fluxes and climate in determining pCO(2) dynamics in maritime temperate lakes.					; Jennings, Eleanor/ISU-1018-2023	McCarthy, Valerie/0000-0002-9169-2043; 													2044-2041	2044-205X				APR 3	2021	11	2					234	249		10.1080/20442041.2021.1893098	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20442041.2021.1893098		APR 2021											WOS:000646920000001
J	Granger, RJ; Hedstrom, N				Granger, R. J.; Hedstrom, N.			Modelling hourly rates of evaporation from small lakes	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												The paper presents the results of a field study of open water evaporation carried out on three small lakes in Western and Northern Canada. In this case small lakes are defined as those for which the temperature above the water surface is governed by the upwind land surface conditions; that is, a continuous boundary layer exists over the lake, and large-scale atmospheric effects such as entrainment do not come into play. Lake evaporation was measured directly using eddy covariance equipment; profiles of wind speed, air temperature and humidity were also obtained over the water surfaces. Observations were made as well over the upwind land surface. The major factors controlling open water evaporation were examined. The study showed that for time periods shorter than daily, the open water evaporation bears no relationship to the net radiation; the wind speed is the most significant factor governing the evaporation rates, followed by the land-water temperature contrast and the land-water vapour pressure contrast. The effect of the stability on the wind field was demonstrated; relationships were developed relating the land-water wind speed contrast to the land-water temperature contrast. The open water period can be separated into two distinct evaporative regimes: the warming period in the Spring, when the land is warmer than the water, the turbulent fluxes over water are suppressed; and the cooling period, when the water is warmer than the land, the turbulent fluxes over water are enhanced. Relationships were developed between the hourly rates of lake evaporation and the following significant variables and parameters (wind speed, land-lake temperature and humidity contrasts, and the downwind distance from shore). The result is a relatively simple versatile model for estimating the hourly lake evaporation rates. The model was tested using two independent data sets. Results show that the modelled evaporation follows the observed values very well; the model follows the diurnal trends and responds to changes in environmental conditions.																			1027-5606						2011	15	1					267	277		10.5194/hess-15-267-2011	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-15-267-2011													WOS:000286723600021

Cyanobacterial water blooms were observed in all waterbodies. Forty-six cyanobacterial taxa were identified, 11 of which are known to be toxic. Eighteen species are reported for the first time in these waterbodies, 8 of which are known to produce toxins. Toxin producing species were found in all of the waterbodies and were primarily dominant in bloom formations ( e. g., Microcystis aeruginosa, Anabaena flos-aquae, Aphanizomenon flos-aquae and Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii). Cosmopolitan species ( e. g., M. aeruginosa), pantropic ( e. g., Anabaenopsis tanganyikae) and holarctic species ( e. g., Anabaena flos-aquae) were encountered. Shallow, eutrophic waterbodies had blooms dominated by Microcystis species and were characterized by phytoplankton association M. Anabaena and Aphanizomenon species of association H were dominant in waterbodies with low dissolved inorganic nitrogen and thermal stratification in the summer. Total cyanobacterial biovolumes (CBV) ranged from 7 to 9,507 cm(3) m(-3) and were higher than Alert Level 2 and Guidance Level 2 (10 cm(3) m(-3); World Health Organization; WHO) in seven of the waterbodies. Chlorophyll a concentrations ranged from 6 to 90,000 mg m(-3) and were higher than Alert Level 2 and Guidance Level 2 ( 50 mg m(-3); WHO) in eight of the waterbodies. There is also an elevated risk of acute toxicosis ( Guidance Level 3; WHO) in five waterbodies. Water of an undesirable quality, hazardous to humans and animals occurs in several Greek waterbodies.					; Thomas, Lanaras/AAC-3946-2020; VARDAKA, Elisabeth/ABD-1341-2020	Moustaka-Gouni, Maria/0000-0002-0845-1928; Vardaka, Elisabeth/0000-0002-3698-9135; 													0921-8971	1573-5176				OCT	2005	17	5					391	401		10.1007/s10811-005-8700-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-005-8700-8													WOS:000232663000003

Six-week time series of eddy covariance CO2 flux at Mammoth Mountain, California:: Performance evaluation and role of meteorological forcing	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												CO2 and heat fluxes were measured over a six-week period (09/08/2006 to 10/24/2006) by the eddy covariance (EC) technique at the Horseshoe Lake tree kill (HLTK), Mammoth Mountain, CA, a site with complex terrain and high, spatially heterogeneous CO2 emission rates. EC CO2 fluxes ranged from 218 to 3500 g m(-2) d(-1) (mean= 1346 g m(-2) d(-1)). Using footprint modeling, EC CO2 fluxes were compared to CO2 fluxes measured by the chamber method on a grid repeatedly over a 10-day period. Half-hour EC CO2 fluxes were moderately correlated (R-2 =0.42) with chamber fluxes, whereas average daily EC CO2 fluxes were well correlated (R-2 = 0.70) with chamber measurements. Average daily EC CO2 fluxes were correlated with both average daily wind speed and atmospheric pressure; relationships were similar to those observed between chamber CO2 fluxes and the atmospheric parameters over a comparable time period. Energy balance closure was assessed by statistical regression of EC energy fluxes (sensible and latent heat) against available energy (net radiation, less soil heat flux). While incomplete (R-2 = 0.77 for 1:1 line), the degree of energy balance closure fell within the range observed in many investigations conducted in contrasting ecosystems and climates. Results indicate that despite complexities presented by the HLTK, EC can be reliably used to monitor background variations in volcanic CO2 fluxes associated with meteorological forcing, and presumably changes related to deeply derived processes such as volcanic activity.

The approach assumes that an overall age-related growth trend typify all tree ring series to be included in a standardized tree ring chronology. Although several potential problems of the method have been examined, the influence of varying the sampling height along tree stems has not been evaluated. Considering that age-related growth trends may vary with stem height, biases may arise when combining samples from unknown or variable sampling heights, a frequent situation with subfossil logs. In this study we perform a detailed stem analysis of 15 lakeshore black spruce (Picea mariana Mill. B.S.P.) trees in the taiga of eastern Canada to describe how the age-related growth trend varies with stem height and evaluate associated biases in RCS chronologies built from living and subfossil trees. Results show that the age-related growth trends vary markedly and systematically along stems, potentially generating large methodological biases in RCS chronologies, especially near the recent chronology end. These biases may lead to erroneous reconstructions of recent climatic trends and cause false divergence between tree ring and climate series. We have developed a correction procedure that appears efficient in removing these biases from chronologies built with the lakeshore trees and associated subfossil logs. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

Detecting climate-driven ecological changes in high-altitude lakes in the Sierra Nevada, California	HOLOCENE												Over the past several decades, increasing climate instability in the Sierra Nevada, California, expressed primarily as reduced winter precipitation and higher temperatures, has led to more frequent drought. High-altitude lakes in this region have been characterized as pristine ecosystems, but growing evidence suggests that they are responding acutely to climate change. To address this, we analyzed the diatom assemblages of two Pb-210 dated sediment cores (Gull and June Lakes) from the eastern Sierra Nevada with the aim of assessing their sensitivity to and timing of responses to climate change at the end of the neoglacial (similar to 1450 CE to similar to 1850 CE) and identifying how climate drivers can impact diatom communities. The nutrient cycles of both lakes have been disrupted by changes in thermal stratification, driven by increasing temperatures, as interpreted from the shift from a Stephanodiscus corruscus dominated ecosystem to a Stephanodiscus minutulus dominance. In this case, the June Lake (the deeper lake) diatom assemblage shifted from an assemblage representative of well mixed conditions to one representative of a stratified system before Gull Lake as a response to increasing temperatures and a strengthened thermocline. We relate the asynchronous change in the thermocline stability to basin morphology, where the deeper lake with a deeper thermocline is more sensitive to increasing temperatures. Further, generalized additive models (GAMs) allowed us to identify the onset of ecological change in both lakes, pointing to the termination of the Little Ice Age (LIA; similar to 1850 CE), revealing an acute response to changing climate.

Hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) in the Canadian archipelago.: 2.: Air-water gas exchange of α- and γ-HCH	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Air and water were sampled in the Canadian Archipelago during summer on the Tundra Northwest 1999 (TNW-99) expedition and air was sampled at Resolute Bay (1313), Nunavut, to determine the gas exchange of a-and gamma-hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) and the enantiomers of alpha-HCH. Air concentrations of Sigma HCH during TNW-99 and at RB were similar, averaging 55 and. 53 pg m(-3), respectively. The net gas exchange direction was volatilization for alpha-HCH and near equilibrium or deposition for gamma-HCH, whereas actual fluxes depended on the fraction of open water. Enantiomer fractions, EF = (+)/[(+) + (-)] of alpha-HCH in air sampled from shipboard were significantly correlated to those in surface water for events with >90% open water, but were closer to racemic and not correlated to EFs in water for events with 0-50% open water. Levels of alpha-HCH in air at RB averaged 37 9 pg m(-3) from June to early July, and EFs were close to racemic (0.496 +/- 0.004). In mid-July the ice pack broke up around RB. From this point through August, air concentrations increased significantly to 53 +/- 5 pg m(-3), and the mean EF decreased significantly to 0.483 +/- 0.009. Air concentrations of gamma-HCH at RB did not differ significantly before (8.0 +/- 3.7 pg m(-3)) and after (6.6 +/- 0.76 pg m(-3)) ice breakup. Results show that a-HCH enantiomers are sensitive tracers for following the impact of ice cover loss on gas exchange in the Arctic.

Predaceous smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) displayed the highest levels of mercury (mean +/- SE, range = 0.49 +/- 0.03, 0.10-1.84 mg/kg, n = 95), followed by omnivorous yellow perch (Perca flavescens; 0.20 +/- 0.03, 0.04-0.87 mg/kg, n = 30) and brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus; 0.16 +/- 0.06, 0.03-0.79 mmg/kg, n = 13), zooplanktivorous kokanee (Oncorhynchus nerka; 0.12 +/- 0.01, 0.07-0.25 mg/kg, n 30), benthivorous pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus; 0.10 +/- 0.01, 0.03-0.28 mg/kg, n = 30), and herbi-detritivorous signal crayfish (Pacifasticus leniusculus; 0.10 +/- 0.01, 0.03-0.54 mg/kg, n = 45). Predaceous cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki) had the lowest levels (0.07 +/- 0.01, 0.03-0.20 mg/kg, n = 30), possibly related to the low trophic level of the smaller size classes captured, natal stream residency of wild fish, or hatchery origins of stocked fish. The fastest rates of mercury bioaccumulation were found in brown bullhead, smallmouth bass, signal crayfish, and yellow perch as indicated by the slopes of their log-transformed mercury concentration-age regression lines. The slopes for cutthroat trout, kokanee, and pumpkinseed suggested very slow uptake in these species.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				DEC	2002	17	4					621	633		10.1080/02705060.2002.9663940	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2002.9663940													WOS:000180470900014
J	COLENUTT, ME; LUCKMAN, BH				COLENUTT, ME; LUCKMAN, BH			DENDROCHRONOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION OF LARIX-LYALLII AT LARCH VALLEY, ALBERTA	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH												Tree-ring chronologies have been developed for alpine larch (Larix lyallii Parl.), alpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt.), and Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry) for a tree-line site at Larch Valley in Banff National Park. The alpine larch and alpine fir chronologies are the first published chronologies developed for these species in the Canadian Cordillera. Alpine larch, a deciduous conifer, has many very narrow and missing rings, making chronology development difficult. These problems were resolved by identifying common marker rings among species growing at the same site. Chronologies for all three species show suppressed growth in the early to mid 1800s followed by a period of higher growth that peaked in the early to mid 20th century and has since declined. The exact timing and nature of response to favourable and unfavourable growth conditions vary with species. Alpine larch exhibits the highest sensitivity, lowest first-order autocorrelation, and greatest common variance, suggesting it has excellent potential as a source of proxy climate data for tree-line sites in this area. Preliminary correlations between Lake Louise climate data and larch ring-width and maximum latewood density chronologies show that there are significant correlations with summer temperature variables. Englemann spruce and alpine fir growing at the same site show a similar response but are more strongly influenced by precipitation and growing conditions of the previous year.																			0045-5067	1208-6037				AUG	1991	21	8					1222	1233		10.1139/x91-171	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x91-171													WOS:A1991GB81400009
J	Rattner, BA				Rattner, Barnett A.			History of wildlife toxicology	ECOTOXICOLOGY					Smithsonian Wildlife Toxicology Workshop	MAR 13-15, 2007	Washington, DC					The field of wildlife toxicology can be traced to the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Initial reports included unintentional poisoning of birds from ingestion of spent lead shot and predator control agents, alkali poisoning of waterbirds, and die-offs from maritime oil spills. With the advent of synthetic pesticides in the 1930s and 1940s, effects of DDT and other pesticides were investigated in free-ranging and captive wildlife. In response to research findings in the US and UK, and the publication of Silent Spring in 1962, public debate on the hazards of pollutants arose and national contaminant monitoring programs were initiated. Shortly thereafter, population-level effects of DDT on raptorial and fish-eating birds were documented, and effects on other species (e.g., bats) were suspected. Realization of the global nature of organochlorine pesticide contamination, and the discovery of PCBs in environmental samples, launched long-range studies in birds and mammals. With the birth of ecotoxicology in 1969 and the establishment of the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry in 1979, an international infrastructure began to emerge. In the 1980s, heavy metal pollution related to mining and smelting, agrichemical practices and non-target effects, selenium toxicosis, and disasters such as Chernobyl and the Exxon Valdez dominated the field. Biomarker development, endocrine disruption, population modeling, and studies with amphibians and reptiles were major issues of the 1990s. With the turn of the century, there was interest in new and emerging compounds (pharmaceuticals, flame retardants, surfactants), and potential population-level effects of some compounds. Based upon its history, wildlife toxicology is driven by chemical use and misuse, ecological disasters, and pollution-related events affecting humans. Current challenges include the need to more thoroughly estimate and predict exposure and effects of chemical-related anthropogenic activities on wildlife and their supporting habitat.																			0963-9292	1573-3017				OCT	2009	18	7					773	783		10.1007/s10646-009-0354-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-009-0354-x								19533341					WOS:000269319900001
J	Aarseth, I; Fossen, H				Aarseth, I; Fossen, H			A holocene lacustrine rock platform around Storavatnet, Osteroy, western Norway	HOLOCENE												A recently discovered lacustrine rock platform at low altitude exists along a 10 km(2) lake on the Osteroy Island near Bergen, western Norway. The lake was converted to a reservoir in 1920 and therefore is subject to frequent changes in level above and below the previous natural level of 151.5 in a.s.l. The rock platform, up to 20 m wide, is developed in strongly foliated metamorphic Proterozoic and Palaeozoic bedrock. Overhanging notches and small caves are developed along bedrock fractures in some places along the platform, which typically tilts 5 to 10 degrees towards the lake and is veneered with angular debris from the cliffs. The study area was deglaciated at the Pleistocene/Holocene transition 10 000 C-14 yr BP, and the tilting of the glacial rebound was complete about 6000 C-14 yr BP. The west-coast climate in Norway during the latter part of the Holocene, with high precipitation and frequent freeze-thaw cycles during winter, resulted in highly fluctuating lake levels. These conditions are consistent with the conclusion that the platform was formed by frost weathering. Mass movement from the steep slopes, together with ice-push during ice breakup, was responsible for transportation of the debris. Because the platform around the lake is essentially at the same level, it must have been formed between the mid-Holocene and AD 1920.

The most marked change occurs between Te Puna and Katikati on the northern Bay of Plenty coast, over a distance of less than 20 km, but strong weathering continues northwards into the southern part of the Coromandel Peninsula. Weathering changes were followed in paleosol, lapilli and basal silt layers of the tephra by field examination of texture and colour. Tamm-extracted Al particular confirmed the extent of weathering, and phosphate retention measurements indicated that the weathering had resulted in the formation of much allophane in the paleosol and lapilli layers of the tephra. Present climatic factors do not appear adequate to account for the observed effects, but the occurrence of buried kauri (Agathis australis) forest to the south of Auckland City approximately 30,000 yr B.P. and the apparent lack of appreciable covering tephra for a relatively long period suggest that past environmental conditions could be more conducive to weathering of Rotoehu Ash in the northern part of the Bay of Plenty and in southenn Coromandel than in areas to the south.																			0028-8365						1977	20	3					303	310																WOS:A1977EX00300009
J	Flöder, S; Burns, CW				Flöder, S; Burns, CW			Phytoplankton diversity of shallow tidal lakes:: Influence of periodic salinity changes on diversity and species number of a natural assemblage	JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												The influence of periodic salinity changes was investigated for 42 days under semicontinuous culture conditions with phosphorus limitation using phytoplankton assemblages from Lake Waihola, a tidally influenced shallow lake. To simulate tidal effects on the phytoplankton community, salinity in the cultures was increased in pulses at different intervals (3.5, 7, and 14 days), and these cultures were compared with those that experienced constant freshwater conditions. Salinity pulses significantly affected competition and succession with a major loss in diversity during the first days of the experiment due to the initial pulse that caused a transition from freshwater to brackish conditions in the cultures. After this initial phase, diversity index (H') and species number (S-corr) decreased less rapidly. The loss in H' and S-corr over time was highest under constant freshwater conditions and lowest in the treatment with an interval of 3.5 days between salinity pulses. At the end of the experiment, the combination of initial loss in H' and S-corr and the time course of H' and S-corr resulted in a U-shaped relation between the interval length of salinity pulses and both H' and S(corr)temp1.txttemp1.txt. Our results indicate that salinity pulses at intervals of a few days tend to promote phytoplankton diversity. If saline intrusions in coastal freshwater systems occur only at spring tides, this will lead to decreases in diversity and species richness.																			0022-3646	1529-8817				FEB	2004	40	1					54	61		10.1046/j.1529-8817.2004.03050.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1529-8817.2004.03050.x													WOS:000188864700006
J	Maher, BA				Maher, B. A.			The magnetic properties of Quaternary aeolian dusts and sediments, and their palaeoclimatic significance	AEOLIAN RESEARCH												Changes in the sources, properties and fluxes of mineral aerosol ('dust') have significance as both indicators and agents of climate change, through radiative, cloud condensation and ocean biogeochemical effects. Quaternary aeolian sediments, worldwide in distribution, can comprise high-resolution archives of past climatic and environmental change, by incorporating chronological, physico-chemical and magnetic information. The magnetic record for a sediment sequence may reflect changes in sediment source, and diagenetic (post-depositional) loss and/or transformation and/or gain of magnetic minerals. Each potential pathway requires careful evaluation, to achieve robust understanding of the palaeo-environmental and/or palaeoclimatic information carried by sediment magnetic properties. The most important minerals for studies of aeolian dusts are those carrying a magnetic remanence at room temperature. For the arid zone, the weakly but very magnetically stable minerals, haematite and goethite, form key magnetic tracers for aeolian transport through space and time. Elsewhere, the strongly magnetic ferrimagnets, magnetite and maghemite, arising from lithogenic and/or in situ sources, can dominate sediment magnetic properties. Magnetic measurements, sensitive even to trace concentrations of these iron minerals, can readily discriminate between different magnetic mineral assemblages, and are also relatively rapid, non sample-destructive, and cost-effective. Combined with robust chronological control, magnetic measurements are a powerful means of identifying palaeoclimatic and palaeoenvironmental change from palaeo-dust records.

J	Wagner, B; Bennike, O; Cremer, H; Klug, M				Wagner, Bernd; Bennike, Ole; Cremer, Holger; Klug, Martin			Late Quaternary history of the Kap Mackenzie area, northeast Greenland	BOREAS												The Kap Mackenzie area on the outer coast of northeast Greenland was glaciated during the last glacial stage, and pre-Holocene shell material was brought to the area. Dating of marine shells indicates that deglaciation occurred in the earliest Holocene, before 10 800 cal. a BP. The marine limit is around 53 m a.s.l. In the wake of the deglaciation, a glaciomarine fauna characterized the area, but after c. one millennium a more species-rich marine fauna took over. This fauna included Mytilus edulis and Mysella sovaliki, which do not live in the region at present; the latter is new to the Holocene fauna of northeast Greenland. The oldest M. edulis sample is dated to c. 9500 cal. a BP, which is the earliest date for the species from the region and indicates that the Holocene thermal maximum began earlier in the region than previously documented. This is supported by driftwood dated to c. 9650 cal. a BP, which is the earliest driftwood date so far from northeastern Greenland and implies that the coastal area was at least partly free of sea ice in summer. As indicated by former studies, the Storegga tsunami hit the Kap Mackenzie area at c. 8100 cal. a BP. Loon Lake, at 18 m a.s.l., was isolated from the sea at c. 6200 cal. a BP, which is distinctly later than expected from existing relative sea-level curves for the region.

J	Marti, CD				Marti, CD			Natal and breeding dispersal in Barn Owls	JOURNAL OF RAPTOR RESEARCH												I studied dispersal of the Barn Owl (Tyto alba) in northern Utah from 1977-96. Based on 144 recoveries of 2085 banded nestlings, the average dispersal distance was 102.9 km (median = 60 km, range = 0-1267 km), occurred in most compass directions from natal sites, but was not random with mountains, deserts, and the Great Salt Lake altering dispersal routes. Dispersal distance was not correlated with severity of winter weather nor population density. Among owls banded as nestlings and recaptured as breeders, females (N = 48) moved significantly farther ((x) over bar = 61.4 km, median = 57.5 km, range = 0-160 km) than males (N = 34, (x) over bar = 35.7 km, median = 14.7 km, range = 0.8-120 km, P = 0.015). Turnover of breeders at nest sites resulted mostly from individuals dispersing into the study area. Only 19 (of at least 500) breeders moved from one breeding site to another. The mean distance moved between breeding sites of 2.3 km (median = 2.25 km) was not significantly different between males and females (P = 0.9), but more females (16) than males (3) made these moves. Eight of the adults that shifted breeding sites did so in the same year either after a failed first attempt (2) or to produce a second brood (6). The remainder changed nest sites in subsequent years.																			0892-1016					SEP	1999	33	3					181	189																WOS:000083354100001

In this paper we report the discovery of more than 40 chondritic porous micrometeorites (CP MMs) in the surface snow and blue ice of Antarctica, which are indistinguishable from CP IDPs. The CP MMs are botryoidal aggregates, composed mainly of sub-micrometer-sized constituents. They contain two components that characterize them as CP IDPs: enstatite whiskers and GEMS (glass with embedded metal and sulfides). Enstatite whiskers appear as <2-mu m-long acicular objects that are attached on, or protrude from the surface, and when included in the interior of the CP MMs are composed of a unit-cell scale mixture of clino- and ortho-enstatite, and elongated along the [100] direction. GEMS appear as 100-500 nm spheroidal objects containing <50 nm Fe-Ni metal and Fe sulfide. The CP MMs also contain low-iron-manganese-enriched (LIME) and low-iron-chromium-enriched (LICE) ferromagnesian silicates, kosmochlor (NaCrSi2O6)-rich high-Ca pyroxene, roedderite (K,Na)(2)Mg5Si12O30, and carbonaceous nanoglobules. These components have previously been discovered in primitive solar system materials such as the CP IDPs, matrices of primitive chondrites, phyllosilicate-rich MMs, ultracarbonaceous MMs, and cometary particles recovered from the 81P/Wild 2 comet. The most outstanding feature of these CP MMs is the presence of kosmochlor-rich high-Ca pyroxene and roedderite, which suggest that they have building blocks in common with CP IDPs and cometary dust particles and therefore suggest a possible cometary origin of both CP MMs and CP IDPs. It is therefore considered that CP MMs are CP IDPs that have fallen to Earth and have survived the terrestrial environment. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

At the same time, surface melt can form surface types that are spectrally similar to blue ice, especially at low elevations. These are termed melt -induced blue ice areas. Both types of blue ice are sensitive indicators of climate change. Satellite remote sensing is a powerful technique to retrieve the spatial extent of blue ice areas and their variation in time. Yet, existing satellite-derived blue ice area products are either mono-temporal for the entire Antarctic ice sheet, or multi-temporal for a limited area. Here, we present FABIAN, a product of blue ice fraction over Antarctica, derived from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) archive covering the period 2000-2021. A spectral mixture analysis (SMA) in Google Earth Engine, based on a careful selection of end -member spectra, accurately reconstructs the reflectance observed by MODIS in blue ice areas. Based on a vali-dation with contemporaneous Sentinel-2 images, FABIAN has a root mean square error in blue ice fraction of approximately 10% -20% in wind-induced blue ice areas, and 20% -30% in melt-induced blue ice areas across six selected test sites in the coastal East Antarctic ice sheet. FABIAN is challenged in regions with shallow melt streams and lakes, since their spectral profiles are similar to those from blue ice areas in MODIS bands. For further analyses and applications, FABIAN holds the potential for (1) deriving annual blue ice area maps, (2) distinguishing between wind-and melt-induced blue ice types, (3) evaluating and correcting (regional) climate models, and (4) analyzing temporal variations in blue ice abundance and exposure.

J	Ellis, AW; Leathers, DJ				Ellis, AW; Leathers, DJ			A synoptic climatological approach to the analysis of lake-effect snowfall: Potential forecasting applications	WEATHER AND FORECASTING												Due to their mesoscale nature, forecasting lake-effect snowfall events is very difficult but extremely important to the inhabitants of those regions subject to this type of severe winter weather. Such is the case along the southern and eastern shores of Lakes Erie and Ontario in the northeastern region of the United States. Here a synoptic climatological approach is used to identify the synoptic-scale atmospheric patterns conducive to lake-induced snowfall to the lee of Lakes Erie and Ontario in the states of New York and Pennsylvania from November to March. The approach used in this study allows for a thorough investigation of the characteristics of each lake-effect synoptic type, including the intrannual and interannual variations in frequency and composite atmospheric fields of sea level pressures, 850-mb temperatures and heights, and 500-mb heights. By combining the lake-effect synoptic types with daily snowfall data for 159 stations across New York and Pennsylvania, direct associations are made between each synoptic type and the mean snowfall and snowfall frequency across that region. Five synoptic types are identified as producing significant rake-effect snowfall in western New York and northwestern Pennsylvania. The large-scale synoptic situation is similar for each lake-effect type; however, each can be clearly distinguished by its wind components, which are important factors in the spatial pattern and intensity of lake-effect snowfall. Variations in the sea level pressure patterns, 850-mb temperatures and heights, 500-mb heights, seasonality, and overlake fetch and strength of flow result in significant differences in the location, magnitude, and frequency of the snowfalls associated with these types. Three of the lake-effect types occur most often in midwinter, while two are most frequent near the beginning and/or end of the snowfall season. Additionally, the interannual frequencies of the midwinter types indicate an upward trend that coincides with evidence of a lake-effect snowfall increase during midseason over the past century. The authors believe that the differences in the lake-effect synoptic types outlined here can be used as additional guidance for more accurate extended forecasts of lake-effect snowfall in northwestern Pennsylvania and western New York.

Potential Impact of Halyomorpha halys (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) on Grape Production in the Finger Lakes Region of New York	JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGICAL SCIENCE												New York State is the leading grape producer in the eastern US and third leading grape producer in the US. The generalist feeding invasive species Halyomorpha halys (Stal) is currently present in NY, although at relatively low densities. Our aim in this study was to determine how H. halys will affect grape production in NY if it becomes well established. We measured the impact of density, sex, and life stage of H. halys on Concord and Chardonnay grapevines by enclosing insects on a single grape cluster using a fine mesh bag. The insects remained caged on the clusters for 2 wk during and after the period of fruit set, after which damaged and undamaged berries were enumerated nondestructively. At this point, we found a strong positive correlation between density and both number and percentage of berries damaged for both nymphs and adults. In late summer, at harvest time, clusters were removed from the vines, damaged and undamaged berries were once again counted, and berries were weighed. Cluster weight for both Chardonnay and Concord cultivars decreased with increased density of adults. Furthermore, adult females were found to have a greater effect than adult males. In contrast to adult feeding, nymphs were found to have little impact on cluster weight. There was relatively little incidence of disease as a result of H. halys feeding. These results show that H. halys is potentially an economic threat to the grape industry in cool-climate regions, but only at high densities currently not observed.

Gastrointestinal Helminth Parasites of Double-Crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) at Four Sites in Saskatchewan, Canada	COMPARATIVE PARASITOLOGY												We examined the gastrointestinal parasite fauna of adult double-crested cormorants from breeding colonies on 4 very different lakes spanning a major ecotone from prairie to boreal forest in Saskatchewan, Canada. Our objectives were to document regional parasite fauna and identify potential differences based on breeding colony location. Eight species of helminths were identified from the stomach and small intestinal contents of 92 cormorants collected during the summers of 2006 and 2007: 2 nematodes-Syncuaria somata and Contracaecum cf. rudolphii; 2 trematodes-Ribeiroia ondatrae and Drepanocephahis spathans; and 4 cestodes-Ligula colymbi, Schistocephalus solidus, Paradilepis caballeroi, and Paradilepis sp. Our results include an apparently undescribed species of Pamdilepis, new host records for L. colymbi, S. solidus, and R. ondatrae, and new geographic records for S. squamata, D. spathans, and P. caballeroi in cormorants of western Canada. Anisakids, C. cf. rudolphii, were present in total stomach contents of all but 1 cormorant and were variably associated with mucosa] ulceration and hemorrhage. The occurrence of an acanthocephalan, Pomphorhynchus bulbocolli, and plerocercoids of the cestode Diphyllobothrium are considered artifacts of a piscivorous diet. Overall, parasite fauna was similar at 3 of 4 lakes: however, birds at a breeding colony that consumed a high proportion of amphibians (instead of fish) had a low prevalence and intensity of D. spathans. Parasite abundance and diversity may be a useful indicator of differences in feeding ecology among wildlife populations.

J	SHELLITO, GA; DECOSTA, J				SHELLITO, GA; DECOSTA, J			PRIMARY PRODUCTION IN A EUTROPHIC ACID LAKE	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Total P concentrations, chlorophyll concentrations and phytoplankton production were investigated biweekly in Tibbs Run Lake, Monogalia County, West Virginia [USA], from March 1977 to March 1978. Mean H+ concentration in the lake was 25.1 .mu.eq l-1 (pH 4.6). The acidic condition of the lake is attributed to inputs of acid via precipitation (mean H+ concentration of the bulk precipitation was 79 .mu.eq l-1, pH 4.1) and the low buffering capacity of the watershed (bedrock composition of sandstone). Effect of the watershed is shown by the net retention of imput of P (.apprx. 26%) and H+ (.apprx. 68%). Total P loading to the lake was 0.495 g P m-2 yr-1. The single inflow accounted for 95% of the total loading while bulk precipitation accounted for the remainder. Mean summer chlorophyll concentration was 22.2 mg m-2. Phytoplankton production expressed volumetrically as a P-vol-x value was 9.78 mg C m-3 h-1. Regression analysis indicated that H+ do not affect chlorophyll concentrations or phytoplankton production but rather that P limits algal biomass. Trophic status of Tibbs Run Lake based on a P budget model, chlorophyll concentration and volumetric production all indicate that the lake is meso-eutrophic.																			0049-6979	1573-2932					1981	16	4					415	431		10.1007/BF01048133	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01048133													WOS:A1981MT72400003

The study was conducted in four typical spaces of a university in Xi'an, China, covering different environmental settings: East Lake (Place 1), tree-lined path (Place 2), campus playground (Place 3), and campus square (Place 4). A total of 322 volunteers participated by completing a subjective sensory questionnaire in randomized environments, and on-place meteorological data were collected. The study yielded three primary findings. First, the tree-lined path (Place 2) was identified as the most comfortable outdoor space on the university campus during summer, whereas East Lake (Place 1) was the least comfortable. Second, substantial residuals were observed for SET, PET, and UTCI across different places when assessing the thermal comfort variations experienced by the subjects. Third, Bayesian regression and random forest regression were employed to analyze and adjust the thermal comfort indices. The comparative study found that after correction, the model explanatory power of PET increased by up to 20%, with the standard deviation of residuals decreasing by up to 0.314 and MSE decreasing by up to 0.1912. The model explanatory power of SET increased by up to 31.2%, with the standard deviation of residuals decreasing by up to 0.3867 and MSE decreasing by up to 0.3012. For UTCI, the model explanatory power increased by up to 10.5%, the standard deviation of residuals decreased by up to 0.2215, and the MSE decreased by up to 0.1002.																			0378-7788	1872-6178				DEC 1	2024	324								114858	10.1016/j.enbuild.2024.114858	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2024.114858		OCT 2024											WOS:001334205600001

Mining previous acoustic surveys to improve walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) target strength estimates	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Acoustic-trawl surveys are widely used to measure the abundance and distribution of pelagic fish. The echo integration method used in these surveys requires estimates of the target strength (TS, dB re 1 m(2)) of acoustic scatterers. Here, we present a new automated method to estimate TS from a large volume of previously collected acoustic survey data recorded near trawl sites. By applying a series of selection and filtering methods to echosounder data, single echo measurements representative of fish encountered during surveys can be objectively and reliably isolated from existing survey data. We applied this method to 30 surveys of walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) conducted in Alaska from 2007 to 2019 and estimated a new length-to-TS relationship. The resulting relationship (T S = 20.0 . log(10) L- 66.0) was largely consistent with previous in situ estimates made during dedicated, mostly nighttime TS collection events. Analysis of this sizeable data set (n =142) indicates that increased fish depth, lower ambient temperature, and summer months may increase pollock TS. The application of a new TS model incorporating these environmental covariates to historic surveys resulted in -16 to +21% changes in abundance relative to the model without environmental covariates. This study indicates that useful TS measurements can be uncovered from existing datasets.

Periphytic diatoms in the presence of a cyanobacterial bloom: A case study of the Vrutci Reservoir in Serbia	ARCHIVES OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Despite their unique ecology and implications for ecological assessment, diatoms in lentic ecosystems are still insufficiently studied in both scientific research and operational monitoring. In particular, the ecology of periphytic diatoms relative to the global expansion of cyanobacterial blooms in lakes has not been described at all. This study aims to describe the diversity and dynamics of a periphytic diatom community in the Vrutci Reservoir during Planktothrix rubescens bloom, and to evaluate the adequacy of standard diatom index implementation in lentic ecosystems relative to the diatom index adapted for lakes - the Trophic Diatom Index for Lakes (TDIL). The study was conducted in the Vrutci Reservoir in western Serbia. Periphyton was developed on an artificial glass substrate during the summer of 2015, following a depth gradient of a stratified water column. Diatom diversity and abundance, as well as diatom indices were estimated. Discounting the cyanobacterial bloom, 79 taxa of diatoms were recorded and among them the species Aneumastus stroesei as the first representative of the entire genus Aneumastus ever to be detected in Serbia. Diatom distribution along the depth gradient was clearly associated with shifts in environmental conditions. TDIL showed an advantage over standard diatom indices in terms of stability during experimental period and uniformity along the depth gradient, indicating the necessity for further testing of this index performance in lakes, and consequently local water-quality legislation update.

The results show that most lakes identical in low water stands at present. But the lakes from East and South Asia are characterised by a lower water levels at full glaciation while the lakes in Northwest Asia are registered higher stands. Conversely, comparative higher lake levels are registered in East and South Asia and lower lake levels appeared in Northwest Asia at 6 ka. Between above two regions, there occurred a climatic transitional zone centred in the area ranged from Central Asia north-eastward to west Mongolian Plateau and south-westward to the Middle East, where the lake behaviors are close to the lakes from Southeast Asia at 6 ka but change to be similar to the lakes from Northwest Asia at 18 ka. This lake level changes in temporal and spatial pattern indicated the global-scale alternation of atmospheric circulation associated with the shifts of westerlies and variation of summer monsoon intensity. The interpretation of changes in lake level and the reconstructions of atmospheric circulation are comparable with GCMs simulated moisture change induced by the change of internal and external forcing during last glacial maximum and mid-Holocene.

J	Hocking, GC; Straskraba, M				Hocking, GC; Straskraba, M			The effect of light extinction on thermal stratification in reservoirs and lakes	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY												An examination is made of the effect of light attenuation in the water column on the hydrodynamics, and in particular on temperature stratification in reservoirs. Numerical experiments are described which examine the differences in light profile in the water column when the spectral character of the incident radiation and light penetration is and is not taken into account. It was found that the exponential character of light penetration remains but the exponent may be increased by up to 20% in clear waterbodies and less in waterbodies with higher extinction values when I-0(lambda) and K-d(lambda) are incorporated. The error may be higher when the spectral character of the extinction is due to colored organics rather than phytoplankton. The numerical, one dimensional hydrodynamic model DYRESM is used to isolate and examine the influence of changing the light attenuation in the water column in a reservoir, and on its hydrodynamics, when keeping other conditions unchanged. Not surprisingly, the simulations show that when the extinction rate increases, mixing depth decreases markedly, and although the same energy enters the water column, surface temperatures increase slightly while deep temperatures decrease. Some other surprising effects were found and are described. The results presented and comparison of the model results with real-world data indicate that the pronounced dependence of mixing depth on light extinction is a general phenomenon which cannot be ignored.

We suggest that they are relict ice gouges, analogous to the modern ice scours of the Northern Caspian, Kara and other seas and lakes, previously studied by side scan sonar (SSS) surveys. Their average dimensions, from 3 to 90 m in width and from hundreds to thousands of meters in length, and spatial distribution were derived from satellite imagery interpretation and structure from motion-processing of UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) images. Ice scouring features are virtually omnipresent at certain seabed sections, evidencing high ice gouging intensity in mid-latitude climates. Their greatest density is observed in the central part of the former East Aral Sea. The majority of contemporary ice gouges appeared during the rapid Aral Sea level fall between 1980 and the mid-1990s. Since then, the lake has almost completely drained, providing a unique opportunity for direct studies of exposed ice gouges using both in situ and remote-sensing techniques. These data could add to our current understanding of the scales and drivers of ice impact on the bottom of shallow seas and lakes.					; Vergun, Alexey/JSK-4966-2023; Baranskaya, Alisa/L-8701-2015; Maznev, Stepan/X-5530-2019; Ogorodov, Stanislav/L-9505-2015	Buharicin, Petr/0000-0002-7220-9714; Bukharitsin, Andrew/0000-0002-9574-2781; Baranskaya, Alisa/0000-0001-8392-1638; Ogorodov, Stanislav/0000-0002-4002-4600; Maznev, Stepan/0000-0002-7187-1423; Arkhipov, Vasiliy V./0000-0002-0437-9439														2072-4292				JAN	2019	11	2							113	10.3390/rs11020113	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs11020113													WOS:000457939400011
J	Solberg, I; Kaartvedt, S				Solberg, Ingrid; Kaartvedt, Stein			Surfacing behavior and gas release of the physostome sprat (Sprattus sprattus) in ice-free and ice-covered waters	MARINE BIOLOGY												Upward-facing echosounders that provided continuous, long-term measurements were applied to address the surfacing behavior and gas release of the physostome sprat (Sprattus sprattus) throughout an entire winter in a 150-m-deep Norwegian fjord. During ice-free conditions, the sprat surfaced and released gas bubbles at night with an estimated surfacing rate of 3.5 times per fish day(-1). The vertical swimming speeds during surfacing were considerably higher (similar to 10 times) than during diel vertical migrations, especially when returning from the surface, and particularly when the fjord was not ice covered. The sprat released gas a few hours after surfacing, suggesting that the sprat gulped atmospheric air during its excursions to the surface. While the surface activity increased after the fjord became ice covered, the records of gas release decreased sharply. The under-ice fish then displayed a behavior interpreted as "searching for the surface" by repeatedly ascending toward the ice, apparently with limited success of filling the swim bladder. This interpretation was supported by lower acoustic target strength in ice-covered waters. The frequent surfacing behavior demonstrated in this study indicates that gulping of atmospheric air is an important element in the life of sprat. While at least part of the population endured overwintering in the ice-covered habitat, ice covering may constrain those physostome fishes that lack a gas-generating gland in ways that remain to be established.

Official geological maps reported lacustrine sediments within the upper basin of the Fosso del Lago stream, where outcrops of lacustrine sediments have also been noted for about five decades. The nineteenth-century Gregorian cadastral map also reports water ponds roughly in the area where lacustrine sediments were found: nonetheless, their position is clearly shifted upstream with respect to the reported lacustrine sediments. In this context, we have recently performed a targeted geomorphological survey addressed at unravelling such apparent discrepancy. Our study confirms the occurrence of lacustrine sediments spanning from Atlantic up to Sub-Boreal exactly in the place reported by previous geological works. The detailed geomorphological map created for the area allowed us to adequately locate previously published subsurface prospecting both highlighting landslide damming as the process responsible for lake formation and providing information for an adequate morphoevolutive reconstruction of the area. Geomorphological mapping also resolved the problem of the different position of the ponds mapped by the Gregorian Cadastre, stating that these had no direct relationships with the former lake but rather consisted of a small man-made reservoir directly connected by broad channels to springs which are currently dried-out.					; Troiani, Francesco/B-7436-2008	SAVELLI, Daniele/0000-0003-3361-831X; Troiani, Francesco/0000-0002-4554-1332													1744-5647						2012	8	1					113	119		10.1080/17445647.2012.668771	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17445647.2012.668771													WOS:000305899100013

Our objective was to characterise the epigeal spider fauna in three mature boreal forest types ( conifer, mixedwood and deciduous) and a disturbed habitat (clearcut) to provide baseline data on the spider species inhabiting major forest types of boreal northwestern Ontario, Canada. Only spring-active epigeal spiders were considered for logistical reasons. We further identified the coarse woody debris structure and microhabitat characteristics within these stand types to try to refine our ability to predict the within-stand occurrence of spiders. We found the clearcut habitat strongly dominated by the Lycosidae with 55% of spiders represented by a single species, Pardosa moesta Banks. The forested habitats were more diverse, with web-building families forming a large component of the fauna and many species represented by only a few individuals. The spider composition of the deciduous stands ( aspen and mixedwood) was very similar, and distinct from that of spruce stands. Species such as Agroeca ornata (Emerton) (Liocranidae) and Pirata montanus Emerton ( Lycosidae) were strongly associated with deciduous leaf litter. Within the spruce stands, Agyneta olivacea ( Emerton) ( Linyphiidae) and Pardosa uintana Gertsch ( Lycosidae) were associated with feathermoss rather than Sphagnum microhabitats. Many of the habitat associations observed at Rinker Lake do not conform well to those described in the taxonomic literature as typical for the species. Few associations with coarse woody debris or microhabitat attributes ( other than ground cover type) were found.

Bloodstream trypomastigotes were used for light microscopy investigations. In the host's blood, slender and stout trypomastigote stages of Trypanosoma grosi kosewiense subsp. n. were observed. The body length of the slender form ranged from 16.27 to 28.05 mum, mean 23.00 mum, and width from 0.79 to 2.56 mum, mean 1.43 mum. The free flagellum is 3.66-12.79 mum long, mean 7.59 mum. The kinetoplast is particularly large. Stout forms have a characteristic broad and short body and is 10.78-23.54 mum long, mean 14.74 mum, and 1.18-2.78 mum width, mean 1.76 mum. In contrast to the slender form of T. grosi kosewiense and many other trypanosomes, the broadest size of its body falls midway of the PN distance, not at the nuclear level. The free flagellum is 5.06-11.86 pm long. It is easy to notice the wide range of morphometric parameters. The results of light microscopy morphological description and morphometrical values of Trypanosma grosi Kosewiense subsp. n. were compared with those of Trypanosoma grosi Laveran et Pettit, 1909 parasitizing the wood Mouse, A. sylvaticus, and revealed that trypanosomes parasitizing the yellow-necked mouse are different in many investigated parameters.

J	SONDERGAARD, M; HANSEN, B; MARKAGER, S				SONDERGAARD, M; HANSEN, B; MARKAGER, S			DYNAMICS OF DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON LABILITY IN A EUTROPHIC LAKE	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The concentration of labile dissolved organic C ([DOCL]) and the plankton community structure were measured weekly during a diatom spring bloom and the subsequent clear-water phase in a eutrophic, temperate lake. The DOCL concentration was assessed by a bacterial regrowth method based on direct measurements of the increase in bacterial biomass and its respiratory demand. [DOCL] ranged from 560 to 1,130 mu g C liter(-1) and accounted for only 5-9% of total DOC. DOCL oscillated around 800 mu g C liter(-1), and the amplitude over 7-d periods was within +/-16% of the in situ bacterial carbon demand. One period (3 weeks) with consistently increasing [DOCL] took place concomitant with the increase in macrozooplankton and bacterial biomass. Thus, DOCL was positively related to decreases in chlorophyll and zooplankton grazing. The increase in DOCL was followed by 3 weeks with decreasing concentrations, when the relationship between DOCL and bacterial production was negative. This pattern gives support to the hypothesis that grazing is a quantitatively important process in the flow of carbon to bacteria. The variations of DOCL were analyzed with a model describing interactions among substrate, bacteria, and grazing. Short-term (days) oscillations probably result from pulses of substrate production that are followed within a few days by bacterial uptake, and long-term (weeks) variations are explained by a variable bacterial substrate affinity (K-m).

Necessity of water treatment to meet lake water quality goals in Chitgar Lake. Lake Reserv Manage. XX:XXX-XXX. Managing urban lake water quality to prevent algae blooms is important for tourism at Chitgar Lake, which is a shallow artificial lake created for recreation in northwest Tehran City, Iran. Its water quality is influenced by the Kan River as its water source, as well as by peripheral activities and bird excrement. This study investigates the effectiveness of different water quality management practices including restricted water intake rules and water treatment from April 2013 to April 2020 to improve the water quality of the lake in order to limit algae blooms. The nonparametric Mann-Kendall method and the Sen function were applied to decipher trends and assess impacts of the practices. Despite intake water control, the trend analysis showed that chlorophyll-a and total phosphorus had increased after the opening of the lake in 2013. However, this incremental trend was greatly reduced after commissioning a treatment plant for improving water quality. The treatment system improves the quality of diverted Kan River water during winter lake refill and is used to treat lake water during the rest of the year. The specific characteristics of the lake and the Kan River prevent achievement of target water quality without water treatment.

Land-use impact on soil solution constituents from an Ultisol of North Florida	NUTRIENT CYCLING IN AGROECOSYSTEMS												Land use management is important to maximize nutrients use efficiency and reduce losses, especially on sandy soils. Nutrient cycling in pastoral systems is different as the grazing animals are excreting back to the pasture most of the ingested nutrients. The objective of this study was to evaluate N, P, K, Ca, Mg, and Na by monitoring elements' concentrations in soil solution from bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum Flugge) pastures continually-stocked with cattle (CP) and rotationally-grazed by goats (GP) in comparison with arable land (AL). Samples were obtained by suction cup lysimeters randomly installed at three depths in an Ultisol of North Florida, USA. To evaluate nutrients in atmospheric deposition, surface and ground waters, samples from rain, nearby spring, lake and three wells on the farm were also analyzed. The results confirmed that land-use management had an effect on soil-solution N, P, K, Ca, Mg, and Na concentrations reflecting managerial and climatic conditions. The means of these nutrients ranged widely from 0.64 to 11.14 mg L-1 for N, 0.03-0.45 mg L-1 for P, 0.12-6.97 mg L-1 for K, 0.37-33.91 mg L-1 for Ca, 0.47-7.39 mg L-1 for Mg, and 1.28-4.37 mg L-1 for Na. The soil-solution N was higher from March through August (wet seasons) and lower and relatively constant between September and February (dry seasons). The N from shallow depth (0.6 m) of CP was fourfold higher than the deep (1.8 m) one and exceeded the maximum permissible level (MPL) of 10 mg L-1. A 1.5-fold increase by depth of AL was detected, and a leaching of 53-98 kg N ha(-1) was identified for both AL and CP during the wet season vs. 4-5 kg ha(-1) leachable N from GP. Also, a 1-3 kg P ha(-1) may be leached from CP during the wet season. The nutrients in the soil solutions tended to be higher than those in rain, lake, sprint, well, and tap waters. In groundwater however, there were episodically N concentrations as high as those in the soil solution.																			1385-1314	1573-0867				JUN	2011	90	2					171	187		10.1007/s10705-010-9420-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10705-010-9420-2													WOS:000290942700001

Several studies showed that meltwater from glaciated and perennially frozen areas can profoundly affect alpine aquatic ecosystems. Here, we present the impressive temporal increase in solutes in Lake Leit, a mountain lake in the Central Alps that is impacted by an active rock glacier. During the last 30 years, concentrations of sulfate and base cations increased by factors of 4 and 3, respectively. Atmospheric deposition, the only catchment external source, could be excluded as possible cause. The inlets have sulfate and base cations concentrations that were up to double the concentrations of the lake outlet confirming the presence of catchment internal sources. The highest concentrations were measured in the springs at the bottom of the rock glacier. Ground surface temperatures of the rock glacier indicated a high probability of permafrost occurrence, while the annual mean air temperature after the mid-1980s showed continuously positive deviations from the long-term average values (period 1961-1990) with increasing values after 2010. delta S-34 of sulfate in the inlets and the outflow indicated that sulfate in Lake Leit mainly derived from dissolution of gypsum/anhydrite even if its presence is not confirmed by the Geologic Atlas of Switzerland. Because of these results, we postulate the presence of subsurface traces of sulfate-bearing evaporites, probably associated with Triassic metasediments. These deposits are very common in the closer surroundings. We further hypothesize that the thawing of permafrost affects the flow path of water enabling its contact with fresh highly weatherable minerals increasing the overall weathering rate and shifting the relative ionic composition in the discharge toward the ions that originate from the most soluble minerals. This study shows that increased permafrost thawing in the future can influence water quality in high-alpine settings.					; Bernasconi, Stefano/E-5394-2010	Steingruber, Sandra Martina/0000-0001-8860-8421; 													1380-6165	1573-1421				JUN	2021	27	2					105	126		10.1007/s10498-020-09388-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10498-020-09388-6		AUG 2020											WOS:000562047400001

Lakes Lungo and Ripasottile are shallow lakes (<10 m deep) located in the tectonically active Rieti Basin in the central Apennines, Italy, where strong normal faulting earthquakes (Mw 6.5 to 7.0) regularly occur. Sediment cores from these lakes provide paleoseismic indicators for the past similar to 1000 years. Sedimento-logical and geochemical analysis reveals four event layers identified in both lakes that correspond with documented large-scale earthquakes in 1298, 1349, 1639, and 1703 AD. Chronological correlation between earthquakes and paleoseismic features is reliable because of the resolution of sediment dating available for the studied cores. The common physical structure is a physically homogenous bed (homogenite) of re-suspended sediment consisting of a denser, high magnetic susceptibility (kappa) clastic base, with organic matter concentrated above. Co-seismic to post-seismic chemical signatures are associated with some event layers and may represent abrupt or transient shifts to a groundwater-dominated system, or permanent changes in groundwater flow and/or spring discharge. Excursions in delta C-13(org) may represent disruptions or changes in carbon source. Not all event layers show the same features, a result attributed to differences in seismic processes as well as the lake attributes, and anthropogenic modification. The observations made here may provide a new means of detecting paleoseismicity and may be applied to other low relief lakes in seismically active areas. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Kaup, E; Burgess, JS				Kaup, E; Burgess, JS			Surface and subsurface flows of nutrients in natural and human impacted lake catchments on Broknes, Larsemann Hills, Antarctica	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												This study aimed to use nutrients in lake inflows as proxies for assessing human impact and separating this from natural transformations of material in the soil active layer. Nutrients, conductivity and delta(18)O were monitored in surface and subsurface (using ceramic tipped piezometers) lake inflows during summer in near natural and human impacted catchments. The nutrient levels were highly variable but generally higher during the last weeks of the flow, in both subsurface waters and in human impacted catchments. Up to 2000 mugN l(-1) subsurface dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) was measured in human impacted catchments but only 315 mug N l(-1) in natural catchments. Subsurface levels of dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) were up to 310 mugP l(-1) in natural catchments and up to 108 mugP l(-1) in human impacted catchments. The maximum levels of both DIN and DRP in surface inflows were much higher in human impacted than in natural catchments. Conductivity and delta(18)O data showed general enrichment of snowbank meltwater presumably through evaporation from the active layer. This combined with fluctuating nutrient levels in catchment waters indicated that soil brines and decaying organic matter of natural and human origin were possible sources for nutrients and other salts. Marked salinization and substantially increased DIN levels near the research stations indicated that lake waters were receiving nutrients generated by humans.																			0954-1020	1365-2079				DEC	2002	14	4					343	352		10.1017/S0954102002000123	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954102002000123													WOS:000181258200007

The study period covers 70 years (1951-2020). The research identified an abrupt and significant change in the climate of Greater Poland, which started between 1987 and 1989, concerning not only air temperature but also a wider spectrum of climatic elements. The change in the state of the climate, which covers the entire Atlantic-Eurasian circulation sector, results from a sudden change in the macro-circulation conditions in the middle troposphere (500 hPa). The reason for the change in the mid-tropospheric circulation is an equally abrupt and simultaneous change in the intensity of the ocean heat transport by the North Atlantic thermohaline circulation (NA THC). Climate change observed in Greater Poland is manifested in an increase in sunshine duration (SD) and air temperature, a decrease in relative humidity, a change in the cloud structure, and an increase in the degree of sky coverage. The main, physical reason for an increase in air temperature is a rapid and strong increase in SD in the warm half-years, which began after 1988, and a significant increase in the frequency of positive North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) phases in winters. The ongoing climate change entails various effects, among which the most important is considered to be hydrological consequences. The water balance of Greater Poland is becoming increasingly unfavourable, mainly as a result of a rapid increase in field evaporation.					; Wrzesiński, Dariusz/I-5765-2019	Wrzesinski, Dariusz/0000-0001-5025-1447; Marsz, Andrzej/0000-0002-1962-8004; 													0137-477X	2081-6383				SEP 1	2022	41	3					183	206		10.2478/quageo-2022-0033	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/quageo-2022-0033		SEP 2022											WOS:000851973400001
J	Danard, M; Munro, A; Murty, T				Danard, M; Munro, A; Murty, T			Storm surge hazard in Canada	NATURAL HAZARDS												Storm surges occur frequently in Canada mainly due to extra-tropical cyclones (ETC'S) also referred to as winter storms. The hurricanes from the Gulf of Mexico can affect eastern Canada including Lakes Ontario and Erie regions, after they get modified and acquire some extra-tropical characteristics. Storm surges have occurred both on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, St. Lawrence Estuary, Bay of Fundy, Hudson Bay, James Bay, Northwest Passage, Beaufort Sea, the Great Lakes and other large lakes such as Lake Winnipeg. Squall lines which are embedded in the larger scale synoptic systems like the ETC'S could also generate storm surges (referred to as edge waves) in Lakes Huron, Erie and Ontario (edge waves are most prominent in Lake Michigan, but Canada has no territory touching this lake). The effect of climate change on storm surges in the Canadian water bodies could be two-fold. First, there may be some possible intensification of the weather systems and the associated wind fields resulting in bigger surges. Second, and probably even more relevant, is an east-west and north-south shift in the tracks of the weather systems, which could expose certain new areas to storm surge activity. A high priority for proper assessment of storm surge hazard is the production of maps showing inundation zones for storm surges that might occur in populated coastal areas. Such maps can be used to improve public awareness of tsunamis and for planning purposes (i.e., to reduce or avoid the risk).																			0921-030X	1573-0840				MAR	2003	28	2-3					407	431		10.1023/A:1022990310410	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1022990310410													WOS:000181762400012

To identify cases and determine risk factors for an outbreak of Escherichia coli (E. coli) O157:nonmotile (NM) infections in children attending a summer day care program in California. Methods. The authors conducted a retrospective cohort study; the cohort comprised first and second graders who attended the day care program during the last week in August 1999. Shiga toxin testing and molecular subtyping using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis were performed on isolates. Lake water, lake bottom sediment samples, and waterfowl feces from the lake environs were cultured for E. coli O157. Results. Three cases of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli O157:NM infections with matching pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns and four probable cases were found. Children who swallowed more than a mouthful of water had a higher attack rate than those who swallowed less than a mouthful or none at all (43% vs. 10%, relative risk = 4.43, 95% confidence interval 1.12, 17.50). Conclusions. E. coli O157:NM infections were associated with swallowing water from a freshwater lake. Potential sources of contamination include feces from humans, cattle, or deer. This outbreak illustrates the value in screening patients with diarrhea for E. coli O157, submitting isolates to public health laboratories, and using molecular techniques to identify related cases. Outbreaks associated with contaminated freshwater could be averted by prevention and early detection of contamination.

Frequent visits were made to each colony and data collected on nests within large artificially enclosed areas. The objective was to identify factors that influence the reproductive success of common tern colonies on the Great Lakes. Hatching success was significantly dependent on clutch size and time of clutch initiation; fledging success was independent of clutch size. The most common category of egg failure was disappearance from the nest. One colony (Port Colborne) realized a significantly higher hatching and fledging success than the others, among which there were no significant differences in prehatch or posthatch success rates. Factors that contributed to differences in reproductive success are presented and their relative contributions to the reproductive success of the tern colonies are discussed. The factors include the relative proportion of 3-egg clutches, incubation time as a measure of parent attentiveness numerical size of the colony, predation, competition for nesting sites by gulls, food availability, flooding and toxic chemicals. No single factor was correlated with reproductive success; caution should be exercised when considering the relationships between reproductive success and factors influencing it.

C.; Paquet, Catherine; Moore, Jean-Sebastien; Power, Michael			Otolith-inferred patterns of marine migration frequency in Nunavik Arctic charr	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Alternative migratory tactics in salmonids reflect the large observed interindividual variation in spatial behaviour which may range from strict freshwater residency to uninterrupted anadromy. In Salvelinus, sea migrations are performed during the ice-free period as freshwater overwintering is thought to be obligatory due to physiological constraints. As a result, individuals can either migrate the next spring or remain in freshwater, as anadromy is generally considered facultative. In Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus), skipped migrations are known to occur, but limited data are available regarding their frequencies within and among populations. Here, the authors used an otolith microchemistry approach relying on strontium (Sr-88) to infer movements between freshwater and marine habitats, and annual oscillations in zinc (Zn-64) to help with age identification. They determined the age-at-first-migration and the occurrence of subsequent annual migrations in two Nunavik Arctic charr populations sampled in Deception Bay (Salluit) and river systems linked to Hopes Advance Bay (Aupaluk), northern Quebec, Canada. The mode for age-at-first-migration was 4+ for both populations, although it exhibited large variation (range: 0+ to 8+). Skipped migrations constituted a rare event, as 97.7% and 95.6% of the examined Arctic charr at Salluit (n = 43, mean age = 10.3 +/- 2.0 years) and Aupaluk (n = 45, mean age = 6.0 +/- 1.9 years), respectively, were found to have performed uninterrupted annual migrations after initiation of the behaviour. The consistency of the annual migrations suggests that the tactic is sufficiently fitness rewarding to be maintained under current environmental conditions. From a fisheries management perspective, these repeated migrations combined with low site fidelity in this species may lead to large interannual variations in abundance at the local scale, which may represent a challenge for monitoring Arctic charr demographics on a river-by-river basis.

J	Liu, JB; Nowaczyk, N; Frank, U; Arz, H				Liu Jiabo; Nowaczyk, Norbert; Frank, Ute; Arz, Helge			Geomagnetic paleosecular variation record spanning from 40 to 20 ka - implications for the Mono Lake excursion from Black Sea sediments	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												The Mono Lake geomagnetic excursion, characterized by low paleointensity and excursional virtual geomagnetic pole (VGP) positions at about 35 ka, has been cumulatively documented from global sites. However, the geomagnetic field geometry during this short-lived excursion is not conclusively described, since excursional directions are only sporadically reported. A full-vector paleosecular variation (PSV) record between 20 and 40 ka could be reconstructed from seven Black Sea sediment cores. The age models of these cores are based on radiocarbon dating and tephrochronology. Further age constrains were achieved by tuning ice rafted debris (IRD) counts and XRF logs (mainly Ca/Ti ratio) as climate proxies for Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) warming events, to the oxygen isotope record from Greenland ice cores (NGRIP). The PSV records of individual Black Sea cores were stacked by using 100-yr bins. At about 34.5 cal. ka BP, the Mono Lake excursion is evidenced in the stacked Black Sea PSV record by both a relative paleointensity (rPl) minimum and directional shifts. Associated VGPs from stacked Black Sea data migrated from Alaska, via the Tibetan Plateau and central Asia, to Greenland, performing a clockwise loop. This agrees with data recorded in the Wilson Creek Formation, USA., and Arctic core PS2644-5 from the Iceland Sea, suggesting a dominant dipole field. On the other hand, the Auckland lava flows, New Zealand, the Summer Lake, USA., and Arctic core ODP-919 yield distinct VGPs located in the central Pacific Ocean due to presumably non-dipole field. Finally, Black Sea sediments younger than the Mono Lake excursion recorded only normal secular variations. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Environmental responses to the 9.7 and 8.2 cold events at two ecotonal sites in the Dovre mountains, mid-Norway	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												We found strong signals of two cooling events around 9700 and 8200 cal yrs. BP in lakes Store Finnsjoen and Flafattjonna at Dovre, mid-Norway. Analyses included pollen in both lakes, and C/N-ratio, biomarkers (e.g. alkanes and br-GDGT5), and XRF scanning in Finnsjoen. The positions of these lakes close to ecotones (upper forest-lines of birch and pine, respectively) reduced their resilience to cold events causing vegetation regression at both sites. The global 8.2 event reflects the collapse of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. The 9.7 event with impact restricted to Scandinavia and traced by pollen at Dovre only, reflects the drainage of the Baltic Ancylus Lake. More detailed analysis in Finnsjoen shows that the events also caused increased allochtonous input (K, Ca), increased sedimentation rate, and decreased sediment density and aquatic production. br-GDGT-based temperatures indicate gradual cooling through the early Holocene. In Finnsjoen, ca. 3100 maxima-minima couplets in sediment density along the analysed sequence of ca. 3100 calibrated years show the presence of varves for the first time in Norway. Impact of the 9.7 and 8.2 events lasted ca. 60 and 370 years, respectively. Pine pollen percentages were halved and re-established in less than 60 years, indicating the reduction of pine pollen production and not vegetative growth during the 9.7 event. The local impact of the 8.2 event sensu lato (ca. 8420-8050 cal yrs. BP) divides the event into a precursor, an erosional phase, and a recovery phase. At the onset of the erosional phase, summer temperatures increased. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Fasola, L; Roesler, I				Fasola, Laura; Roesler, Ignacio			A familiar face with a novel behavior raises challenges for conservation: American mink in arid Patagonia and a critically endangered bird	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Invasive American mink is a severe threat to endangered waterbird populations. In Europe and South America, control efforts have been increasing in the last decades. Mink has a proven acute impact on the Hooded Grebe, a critically endangered specialist of highland plateau lakes in Patagonia where a single mink attack can deplete up to 4% of the global population. We aimed to examine mink ecology in Austral Patagonia to inform ongoing control programs in the region and contribute to efforts elsewhere to counteract mink impact. We evaluated mink distribution at a regional scale and found that its distribution extends across the steppe-arid environment, often assumed to be an obstacle for mink colonization. Consequently, its current distribution fully overlaps with the Hooded Grebe breeding grounds. At a finer scale, we used 3 techniques to detect American mink at different times of the year and found a temporal sex-biased occupation-dispersion pattern: permanent presence of both sexes in areas around the plateaus used by grebes and upstream male biased dispersion in late summer (which leads young mink to the grebes' lakes). Therefore, plateau perimeters function as an invasion front that resets yearly. Lastly, from scat content analysis we detected a shift in mink diet from a generalist type in lowland rivers to a diet specialized on birds in highland lakes, where attacks are exclusively directed towards Hooded Grebes and where waterbird presence might be a determinant of mink presence (regardless of other prey). All of these findings have profound relevance for control schedules and priorities.

J	Miguel, S; Bolívar, JP; García-Tenorio, R				Miguel, S; Bolívar, JP; García-Tenorio, R			Mixing, sediment accumulation and focusing using 210Pb and 137Cs	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												The Portil lagoon is a natural freshwater reservoir located at the southwest of Spain, near the coast. In its surroundings an important tourist complex has been developed since the earlier 1970s. This has resulted in increased loads of nutrients, specially during summer months. In order to evaluate the impact from humans on the lagoon caused by anthropogenic activities, we have determined vertical profiles of excess Pb-210 and Cs-137 in a sediment core taken from its bottom. Vertical profile of excess Pb-210 seems to indicate that the sediment core was affected by large-scale mixing processes. Nevertheless this possibility was ruled out based on the shape of the Cs-137 vertical distribution after modelling the Cs-137 profile considering large-scale mixing. The chronology developed from Pb-210 and Cs-137 has allowed us to calculate the temporal evolution of the mass sedimentation rate during the last century. This mass sedimentation rate increased in 1973: from 0.08(2) g cm(-2) a(-1) in the period 1900-1973 to 0.17(5) g cm(-2) a(-1) in the period 1973-1995. This increase could be related to land-movements in the drainage area and to permitted sewage inputs into the lagoon, both with its origin in the growing/running of the surrounding tourist complex.

J	Li, Z; Gao, YH				Li, Zhe; Gao, Yanhong			Impact of Interaction between Metropolitan Area and Shallow Lake on Daily Extreme Precipitation over Eastern China	ATMOSPHERE												Both cities and lakes have significant impacts on regional precipitation. With global warming, extreme precipitation events in Eastern China have increased significantly, and the single/joint influences of metropolises and lakes on extreme precipitation still need to be quantitatively evaluated. To reveal the impact of the single/joint influences of metropolises and lakes on the shear line torrential rain process, the Suzhou-Wuxi-Changzhou Metropolitan Area (SXCMA) and Lake Taihu in Eastern China were selected as the study area. Utilizing a WRF model, comparative studies of sensitivity simulations were conducted for the two typical extreme precipitation events caused by the low-level shear line (LLSL) on 27 June 2015 (EP627) and 25 September 2017 (EP925). Both results show that the existence of Lake Taihu and SXCMA will increase precipitation in the study area. SXCMA has a more obvious effect on enhancing precipitation, which is about twice the effect of Lake Taihu. SXCMA mainly strengthens the intensity and movement of the surface convergence line (SCL) in the study area and indirectly affects the shift of the LLSL, which finally affects the intensity and location of precipitation. Lake Taihu affects the intensity and movement of SCL, triggering ground vertical convections due to lower surface roughness, and acts as a land-lake breeze and water vapor source, which will affect the distribution and intensity of precipitation.						gao, yan hong/0000-0002-0403-2929; Li, Zhe/0000-0002-4059-8532														2073-4433				FEB	2022	13	2							306	10.3390/atmos13020306	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos13020306													WOS:000764171300001
J	Schulz, M; Kozerski, HP; Pluntke, T; Rinke, K				Schulz, M; Kozerski, HP; Pluntke, T; Rinke, K			The influence of macrophytes on sedimentation and nutrient retention in the lower River Spree (Germany)	WATER RESEARCH												Nutrient retention due to sedimentation in running waters has been little studied. The knowledge about the processes of self-purification is important for the management of rivers. The principal aim of our investigations was to quantify nutrient retention by sedimentation within and adjacent to stands of submerged macrophytes. In addition, we examined the relationship between deposition and sedimentation patterns and the flow regime. In the summer of 2001, investigations were performed in the lower River Spree with sediment traps and sediment cores and measurement of flow velocities. The spatial distribution of macrophytes was described and related to sedimentation and flow patterns. Water and sediment samples were analysed for total phosphorus and total organic nitrogen concentrations. Macrophytes significantly enhanced water residence time by factors between 2 and 18. Trapping rates were high within and downstream of macrophyte stands due to the prevailing quiescent conditions. Trapping rates were low in regions not covered by macrophytes, where flow,velocities were high. Calculated deposition of organic matter due to trapping rates accounted for 15-49% of observed deposition between May and September, the vegetation period. The difference between calculated and observed deposition can partly be attributed to an incomplete erosion of the organic sediments between October and April. Between May and September, nitrogen and phosphorus were retained by deposition by as much as 2.5% and 12.2%, respectively (% of total load). Therefore, macrophytes considerably contributed to total monthly phosphorus retention (up to 25%) by increasing deposition of particulate organic matter. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Hindar, A; Wright, RF				Hindar, A; Wright, RF			Long-term records and modelling of acidification, recovery, and liming at Lake Hovvatn, Norway	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Lake Store Hovvatn and the adjacent Lake Lille Hovvatn (Norway) are acidified owing to long-term deposition of S and N. By 1974, pH was 4.46 and acid-neutralizing capacity was -42 mu equiv.center dot L-1. Following a lake SO4 reduction from 92 to 33 mu equiv.center dot L-1, pH had increased to 4.8 and acid-neutralizing capacity had increased to -8 mu equiv.center dot L-1 by 2003. The acidification history is well reconstructed using the dynamic model MAGIC. The model predicts that the lakes will not, however, recover to conditions adequate to support a self-reproducing brown trout (Salmo trutta) population. Lake Store Hovvatn was first limed in 1981 and subsequently annually or biannually until 1999, at which time the entire catchment was limed. Liming increased pH to above target levels of 6.0 and reduced inorganic Al to below 5 mu equiv.center dot L-1 in the main water body. Only after the terrestrial liming in 1999, however, was pH potentially adequate for egg survival in the lake during winter, as pH at shallow depths below the ice stayed above 5.5. The results indicate that even the dramatic reduction in acid deposition in Europe will be insufficient to provide water quality adequate for fish populations; such lakes will require some sort of liming for many decades to come.

Prior to 10,000 yr BP, cold conditions were indicated by the lack of temperate taxa and the presence of cold-stenotherms. The abundance and diversity of warm-adapted taxa (e.g., Dicrotendipes, Microtendipes, Polypedilum and Cladopelma) increased rapidly after 9500 yr BP, whereas taxa indicative of cold conditions disappeared. Beginning prior to deposition of the Mazama ash (6730 +/- 40 yr BP), several warm-adapted taxa decreased in abundance. Mid- to late-Holocene assemblages (ca. 4500 yr BP to present) indicated continued cooling as revealed by a further reduction in diversity and abundance of warm-adapted taxa at both lakes, and the reappearance of cold-stenotherms in Lake of the Woods. Diversity changes in the cores paralleled the inferred climatic changes. Diversity was low during the late-glacial, increased in the early-Holocene, and declined after 5400 yr BP To quantitatively infer past climatic changes, a new weighted-averaging partial-least-squares (WA-PLS) model was developed and applied to the fossil midge data. The quantitative reconstructions revealed late-glacial mean July air temperatures ranging from about 8 to 10degreesC. Summer air temperatures were highest in the early Holocene (13 to 17degreesC), gradually decreasing by about 3degreesC through the mid- to late-Holocene.																			0921-2728	1573-0417				NOV	2002	28	4					469	490		10.1023/A:1021644122727	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1021644122727													WOS:000179882600007

Recent years have seen efforts to reduce loads through agricultural practices such as conservation tillage, efficient fertilization, and reservation of erodible areas. Monitoring the efficacy of such efforts is complicated by the fact they take place against a varying climatic and hydrologic background. In this study, statistical analysis was used to identify those climatic, hydrologic. and agricultural variables that best explained variations in nitrate, phosphorus, and total suspended solids over the period 1976-1995 in two large agricultural watersheds that feed Lake Erie, those of the Maumee and Sandusky Rivers. The dominant variable was stream discharge; after curvefits to remove its influence, the residual loads were tested via stepwise linear regression to reveal the most significant explanatory variables. Loads of nitrate, total suspended solids, and total phosphorus tended to decrease when previous months were wet, except in the summer, and to decrease when snow cover was extensive. It is speculated that stores of nitrate in the soil were lost during wet periods through increased crop uptake and/or leaching. Nitrogen fertilizer application in the Maumee watershed decreased following dry periods, but not enough to decrease, stream loads. Soluble reactive phosphorus loads were negatively correlated to conservation tillage and reserves, and positively correlated to fertilizer and manure sources. Results for total phosphorus were similar to those for total suspended solids, on which most transported phosphorus is adsorbed.																			0047-2425					JAN-FEB	2002	31	1					72	83											11837447					WOS:000173484300009

Chlorophyll a (Chl a) quickly declined as water flowed from Lake Ontario into the river. Thereafter, in the reach upstream from Montreal, Chi a was -1 mu g.L-1 and total phosphorus (TP) was -10 mu g.L-1. Downstream from Montreal, TP increased to 20-40 mu g.L-1 and Chl a rose to 2-5 mu g.L-1. Although Chi a increased concomitant with TP, phytoplankton may have been light limited at the more turbid downstream stations. Zooplankton biomass decreased from 40 mu g dry mass.L-1 in Lake Ontario to 16 mu g dry mass.L-1 at Brockville, 90 km downstream. Zooplankton biomass continued to decline and downstream from Montreal remained <10 mu g dry mass.L-1, despite the increased TP and Chl a. Rotifers dominated the zooplankton community, but as in other temperate rivers, total zooplankton biomass was low (<10 mu g dry mass.L-1). There was no longitudinal pattern in heterotrophic bacterial or flagellate abundance. A comparison of the inflow and outflow biomass of two fluvial lakes showed the lakes to contribute little to the downstream river plankton during summer.

In this study, we use records of diatom populations, magnetic susceptibility, total organic carbon, carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, and delta C-13 from two lacustrine sediment cores in eastern Taiwan to reconstruct the paleoenvironment and the paleo-typhoon records during the late Holocene. Significant changes in lithology and in multi-proxy data in the record from lowland Liyu Lake (LYL) show that LYL became hydrologically isolated by 2850 cal BP, possibly as a result of landslide-induced alluvial fan formation. Synchronous increases of the diatom-inferred lake level proxy for LYL and regional precipitation proxies reflect a strengthened East Asia summer monsoon since 1600 cal BP. Eutrophication of the water in LYL is also inferred, and this is interpreted to be related to agricultural activities, which provides evidence for changes in land use during the past 200 years. The occurrence of diatom valves in sediment of the mountain Tunlumei Pond (TLM) indicates that the pond area has been stable since 760 cal BP, which reflects an increase in the local precipitation. The decrease of diatom-inferred pH indicates an increase in the input of acid runoff from the watershed during typhoon-triggered heavy rainfall. Both lacustrine records suggest that the typhoon intensity increased during the early Little Ice Age. The sediment records in northeastern Taiwan also suggest an increase in typhoon activity during the late Little Ice Age.

Its bottom waters remain stratified year-round because of a strong salinity-driven density gradient. We have assessed spatial patterns in and relationships between major biogeochemical processes in the water column of Lake Vanda. Samples were collected in the austral summers of 2008 and 2011 to measure concentrations of metabolites associated with a suite of biogeochemical processes across the deep salinity gradient. The shapes of the resulting geochemical profiles were consistent between 2008 and 2011. Metabolite production and consumption rates were estimated using a reactive transport model based on the assumption that vertical diffusion was the only active physical transport process. We validated this model for nitrification by using stable isotope incubations to show that this process was only active at depths predicted by the model. No nitrification activity was observed at 68 m depth in spite of overlapping oxygen and ammonium gradients. We attribute this lack of activity to the competitive inhibition of ammonia monooxygenase by methane. Net nitrous oxide and nitrate consumption were observed in the oxic water column, providing evidence of aerobic denitrification. The depth of maximum net oxygen production did not coincide with the deep chlorophyll maxima (at 59.3, 63, and 68.2 m) measured in the same profile. Finally, the integrated sulfide oxidation rate was high compared with other oxidation processes, indicating that sulfide was an important electron donor for the water column microbial community.					; Schutte, Charles/Q-3553-2017	Joye, Samantha/0000-0003-1610-451X; Schutte, Charles/0000-0002-3907-7828; Bowles, Marshall/0000-0002-0464-5880													0024-3590	1939-5590				MAR	2020	65	3					569	581		10.1002/lno.11327	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.11327													WOS:000518043600009

The effects of seston lipids on zooplankton fatty acid composition in Lake Washington, Washington, USA	ECOLOGY												We collected suspended particulate matter (seston) and zooplankton samples from Lake Washington in Seattle, Washington, USA, over a 10-month period to investigate the effects of food availability on zooplankton fatty acid (FA) composition. The percentage of nutritionally critical omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the seston varied from 8% of the FA pool in midsummer to 30% during the spring diatom bloom. Zooplankton accumulated much higher percentages omega 3 PUFA than was available in the seston. In particular, cladocerans preferentially accumulated eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5 omega 3) copepods accumulated docosahexacnoic acid (DHA, 22:6 omega 3), and both copepods and cladocerans accumulated 18 carbon chain omega 3 PUFAs (C-18 omega 3). By comparison, the FA of zooplanktivorous juvenile sockcye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) were strongly dominated by EPA (12.5% +/- 2.1%) and DHA (28.2% +/- 8.7%). The saturated fatty acid and the arachidonic acid (ARA, 20:4 omega 6) composition of Diaptomus ashlandi was strongly (r(2) = 0.76) and moderately (r(2) = 0.54) correlated with the prevalence of these FAs in the seston. Furthermore, the DHA content of Diaptomus was moderately correlated with the seston's DHA content (r(2) = 0.45) and very strongly correlated with seston EPA (r(2) = 0.89). Since EPA was the most prevalent PUFA in the seston and DHA was the most prevalent PUFA in Diaptomus, these results suggest that Diaptomus may synthesize DHA from the EPA in their food. In general. zooplankton species in Lake Washington were strongly enriched with those FA molecules that are most physiologically important for fish nutrition (i.e,, ARA, EPA, and DHA), indicating a clear mechanism by which changes in seston composition influence fisheries ecology.					; Arhonditsis, George/C-6980-2009; Brett, Michael/A-2066-2010	Arhonditsis, George/0000-0001-5359-8737; Brett, Michael/0000-0002-8796-9863													0012-9658	1939-9170				JAN	2010	91	1					180	190		10.1890/08-2037.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/08-2037.1								20380207					WOS:000275458500021

Wetland sedimentation and associated diatoms in the Pleistocene Olorgesailie Basin, southern Kenya Rift Valley	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												The Olorgesailie Basin in the southern Kenya Rift Valley contains a variety of lacustrine, wetland and terrestrial facies that were laid down during the last 1.2 million years. This study integrates diatom, ichnofossil, and rhizolith (silica and carbonate) evidence in order to identify and characterize shallow wetland deposition at the top (Member 14: ca. 493 ka) of the Olorgesailie Formation. A key feature of these deposits is the presence of facies with aquatic indicators (diatoms) that are overprinted by ichnofossils and rhizoliths that suggest drier conditions. Diatom floras include several fresh water Aulacoseira spp. and saline indicators such as Thalassiosira rudolfi, T faurii, Cyclotella meneghiniana and Anomoeoneis sphaerophora. The main indicators of shallow fresh to mildly saline waters include Epithemia argus, Rhopalodia gibberula, Encyonema muelleri, and Synedra spp. Three main suites of ichnofossils indicate varying water table depths during their formation. These consist of 1) horizontal tunnels that suggest saturated substrates; 2) vertical burrows formed in substrates with relatively lower water tables: and 3) termite, hymenopteran, and beetle ichnofossils that indicate dry substrates. Member 14 of the Olorgesailie Formation also contains carbonate and siliceous rhizoliths, which occur both together and separately. Four possible models are suggested to explain the silica and carbonate rhizolith formation: 1) a complex of spring-fed marshes and dry areas; 2) ephemeral wetlands and floodplains; 3) wetlands with abundant organic decay, and 4) initial carbonate rhizoliths that were replaced by silica. Preservation of cellular structures and the reworking and incorporation of rhizoliths; in overlying younger strata suggest that they formed early during diagenesis. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The fluxes of fossil pigments and total diatom valves, as well as diatom assemblages, did not show any marked changes from the 1960s to the mid-1970s, suggesting that the anthropogenic nutrient input was insufficient for changing the lake trophic status, despite the increased anthropogenic activities around the lake along with the concurrent rapid economic growth in Japan. After the 1990s, the increased fluxes of fossil pigments and percentage of eutrophic diatom species were suggestive of nutrient enrichment in the lake water. After the late 1990s, the stable nitrogen isotope ratios of bulk sediment (delta N-15(bulk)) gradually decreased with concurrent increases in the total nitrogen (TN) flux, thereby suggesting enhanced atmospheric nutrient deposition. In addition, the reconstructed Chl-a flux considered for post-burial degradation was significantly positively correlated with the summer surface water temperature since 2006. These findings suggest that, in recent decades, not only the anthropogenic nutrient loadings, but also climate warming might have significantly affected the eutrophication in Lake Yamanaka.					; Kuwae, Michinobu/AAG-3846-2020; Yamamoto, Shinya/C-5134-2011; Tsugeki, Narumi/AAV-2862-2021	Yamamoto, Shinya/0000-0001-7938-1106; Tsugeki, Narumi/0000-0003-1236-906X; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				APR	2023	850	7					1487	1501		10.1007/s10750-022-05071-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-022-05071-9		NOV 2022											WOS:000880507100002

Eugene			Microphytobenthos along the Louisiana continental shelf during mid-summer hypoxia	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												Microphytobenthos may influence benthic processes, such as the oxygen dynamics in the bottom-water of the hypoxic area of the northern Gulf of Mexico. We collected sediment along the Louisiana continental shelf similar to 14-20 m isobath from the Mississippi River to lake Calcasieu, LA, during periods of extensive bottom-water hypoxia in July 2006-2008 to estimate microphytobenthos biomass (chlorophyll a) and community composition. Typical sediment chlorophyll a concentrations were < 1.0 mu g g dry sed(-1), with the highest mean concentration at a sandier mid-shelf area, and the lowest mean concentration at a station near the Mississippi River. Microphytobenthos abundances in the size fraction > 3 mu m ranged from 0.7 x 10(1) to 1 x 10(5) cells g dry sed(-1). Benthic cells represented on average 67% of total cell abundance, varying from 1 to 99%, while pelagic and tychopelagic phytoplankton cells contributed to the remainder. Microphytobenthos were composed of diatoms (Nitzschia, Gyrosigma, Pleurosigma and Bacillaria) and cyanobacteria (filamentous and colonial). Our results indicate that environmental variables, mainly seafloor PAR and bottom-water nutrient concentrations correlated the most with the spatial distribution of microphytobenthos biomass and composition. Microphytobenthos along the Louisiana continental shelf, in turn, could influence benthic processes, such as secondary production, nutrient fluxes and oxygen dynamics. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Radix shells were sampled for isotope ratio analysis with high spatial resolution along the ontogenetic spiral of growth providing the basis of isotope records with a sub-seasonal time-resolution. delta O-18 values of shells from Bangda Co are on average similar to-15.0 parts per thousand relative to PDB and the pattern exhibits a clear onset and progression of the summer monsoon precipitation indicated by a strong "amount effect". This pattern mirrors the precipitation pattern in the respective year and region as expected for a small (surface area ca 0.3 km(2)) and shallow (<5 m) lake or habitat with short water residence times and little evaporative O-18 enrichment of the lake water. In contrast, delta O-18 values of Radix shells from Kyaring Co habitat A which is connected to the deep (several tens of metres) and big (surface area ca 660 km(2)) lake, average at similar to-13.0 parts per thousand consistent with a higher evaporation rate and longer water residence time. The latter is supported by more O-18 enriched water in this habitat. The delta O-18 values of Radix shells from Kyaring Co habitat B are nearly as low as shells from Bangda Co due to the similar habitat characteristic but isotopic patterns of these shells exhibit a weaker "amount effect". In both lake systems delta C-13 values of the shells are coupled with oxygen isotopes because a large amount of isotopically light carbon is washed from mountain slopes into the lake during the rainy season. Although other processes influence the isotopic patterns, e.g. biological productivity (delta C-13) or temperature (delta O-18), these influences are minor compared with the monsoon signal or the effect of evaporation in the Radix shell records. The overall weaker amount effect in Radix shells from Kyaring Co habitat B compared with shells from Bangda Co are consistent with a current decreasing monsoon influence from the south-eastern edge towards the central Tibetan Plateau. Thus, fossil shells of the gastropod genus Radix are a valuable archive for reconstructing climatic and environmental changes on the Tibetan Plateau and provide information about former habitat sizes and depths.

Strain FP5(T) was strictly aerobic. Cells were coccoidal, occurring singly or in clusters. The cell-wall pepticloglycan type of strain FP5(T) was A4 beta based on L-Orn-D-Asp. Strain FP5(T) was characterized chemotaxonomically by having MK-7 as the major menaquinone and anteiso-C-15:0, anteiso-C-17:0, iso-C-15:0 and iso-C-16:0 as the main fatty acids. The isolate grew optimally at 37 degrees C and in presence of 10 % NaCl; no growth was observed in the absence of NaCl. The DNA G + C content was 43.5 mol%. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain FP5(T) falls within the evolutionary radiation of species of the genus Halobacillus. Levels of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity between strain FP5(T) and the type strains of nine recognized Halobacillus species were in the range 97.0-99.0%. Levels of DNA-DNA relatedness indicated that strain FP5(T) represents a genomic species that is distinct from recognized Halobacillus species. Strain FP5(T) could be differentiated from recognized Halobacillus species based on several phenotypic characteristics. On the basis of phenotypic, phylogenetic and genomic data, strain FP5(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Halobacillus, for which the name Halobacillus alkaliphilus sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is FP5(T) (=DSM 18525(T) =ATCC BAA-1361(T)).					Finore, Ilaria/P-9423-2018; Huertas, F. Javier/K-7842-2019; lama, licia/AAX-6572-2020; Huertas, F.

Lake Tuz basin, central part of the Anatolian Plateau, Turkey, had two high lake-level stages dated as about 20,000 - 17,000 years ago and about 13,000 years ago. At the high lake stages, water level rose more than 15 m higher than the present lake level, and the lake area spread widely to near the southern edge of the basin, as inferred by lithologic and chronological investigation of drilling cores. In the Holocene, lake level fell and the southeast part of the basin became extensive lake terraces. Alluvial fans have formed along the edge of the upland area on the terraces in the Holocene. Stratigraphy and dating of the fan deposits show the fluctuations in the depositional rates of the fans. Major formative stages of the fans are dated about 7000-5500 and 2500-2000 years BP, and several times of minor stages (probably 4300 and 3000 years BP) occurred between the two major stages. Our archaeological research shows that there are strong relationships between the distributions of archaeological sites of this area and the above geo-environmental histories.

Lake-levels were generally high from 9200 to 8000 yr B.P., falling from then until c. 6500-6000 yr B.P., and rising again by 5000 yr B.P. Temporary lowerings were recorded c. 4000 yr B.P. and c. 2000 yr B.P., and water levels have risen dramatically since c. 500 yr B.P. The reconstruction is based on sedimentologic and fossil analyses of multiple cores, as well as on geomorphological evidence. Comparison of lake-level fluctuations in south-central Sweden with those from southern Sweden and western Finnish Lapland, and with records of glacier fluctuations in the Scandinavian Mountains suggest a distinct north-south contrast in water balance from 9000 to 5000 yr B.P., consistent with strongly zonal atmospheric circulation during that period. Between 7000 and 5000 yr B.P. the mid-Holocene dry period appears to have been time-transgressive across Scandinavia, perhaps as a result of a gradual shift in the position of the Atlantic Polar Front and its associated cyclonic stormtrack. Since 4000 yr B.P., however, most detectable fluctuations are synchronous across Scandinavia, with the most prominent and widespread change being increased net moisture during the ''Little Ice Age''.																			0031-0182	1872-616X				NOV	1995	118	3-4					269	290		10.1016/0031-0182(95)00002-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0031-0182(95)00002-2													WOS:A1995TJ45200005

Holocene mountain glacier history in the Sukkertoppen Iskappe area, southwest Greenland	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Mountain glaciers and ice caps (GIC) independent of the Greenland Ice Sheet respond rapidly to climate variations and records of their past extent provide information on the natural envelope of climate variability. Here, we use a multi-proxy approach that combines proglacial lake sediment analysis, cosmogenic nuclide surface-exposure dating (in situ Be-10 and C-14), and radiocarbon dating of recently ice-entombed moss to generate a centennial-scale record of Holocene GIC fluctuations in southwestern Greenland. Following local deglaciation similar to 10-9 ka, sediments from proglacial Crash Lake record a glacier advance at similar to 9 ka that is indistinguishable from nearby ice sheet moraines, implying a synchronous response of GIC and the Greenland Ice Sheet to a centennial-scale climate event. Following this local glacier advance, GIC experienced net recession until similar to 4.6 ka. Radiocarbon ages of in situ moss (n = 29) and Crash Lake sediments reveal intervals of glacier expansion at similar to 1.8, 1.2 and 0.7 ka that are superimposed on an overall trend of net glacier expansion throughout the late Holocene. In situ C-14 concentrations from bedrock adjacent to radiocarbon-dated moss samples further constrain the duration of ice cover through the Holocene in this region. We find that our glacier-size proxy records during the past similar to 4 ka are broadly consistent with relatively lower temperatures recorded in GISP2 and occur during, or following, intervals of volcanic perturbations. Thus, we speculate that volcanic activity, although less frequent and intense than in the early Holocene and during the Little Ice Age, may have led to centennial-scale variability imprinted on net glacier expansion due to decreasing summer insolation through the late Holocene.

Ice-covered ponds in the Untersee Oasis (East Antarctica): Distribution, chemical composition, and trajectory under a warming climate	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Climate change is impacting lakes and ponds in Antarctica. To that end, we investigated the distribution and chemical composition of ice-covered ponds in Untersee Oasis, East Antarctica. Thirty-nine ponds were inventoried, and the thirteen sampled ponds have low total dissolved solutes (TDS) with a Ca(Na)-SO4 or Na-Cl geochemical facies. Tritium and radiocarbon measurements of the total inorganic carbon (TIC) suggest that the ponds are recharged by modern snowmelt. Hierarchical cluster analysis grouped the ponds based on the amount of potential incoming solar radiation reaching their surface. Ponds receiving higher insolation develop moats or completely lose their ice cover during summer, have lower pH, and higher TDS, delta O-18, total inorganic carbon, and delta C-13(TIC),which suggest CO2 availability is not limiting benthic photosynthetic activity. The ponds that receive lower insolation retain their full ice cover and remain well-sealed to direct exchanges with the atmosphere, have high pH, and lower TDS and TIC, and likely host a CO2-starved benthic microbial ecosystem. Therefore, the state of the ponds' ice cover evolved their hydrochemistry along different trajectories. The findings can be used to predict the trajectory of the chemical composition of the ponds and effect on biological productivity as the phenology of their ice cover shifts under a warming climate.					; Andersen, Dale/B-4816-2013	Faucher, Benoit/0000-0002-3954-8386; Lacelle, Denis/0000-0002-6691-8717; 													1523-0430	1938-4246				JAN 2	2021	53	1					324	339		10.1080/15230430.2021.2000566	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15230430.2021.2000566													WOS:000728727400001

The data reveal that the paleovalley floor is defined by a gravel unit containing bouldersized clasts up to 30 cm in diameter, deposited after ca. 30 ka but before ca. 9 ka. Paleohydrology during that time and the previous glacial maximum was characterized by a weak monsoon and reduced river discharge, both of which are inconsistent with large valley formation. However, our work indicates that glacial-lake outburst floods sourced from the Tibetan reaches of the Brahmaputra were routed through the lowstand valley, producing megaflood-scale discharge capable of transporting gravel and cannibalizing the valley margins. The timing of these glacial-lake outburst flood-driven discharge events was coincident with valley development and explains the anomalously large width of the valley and basal gravel surface. Despite the underfit scale of Brahmaputra discharge following the last glacial period, a strengthening monsoon and high sediment discharge in the early Holocene subsequently contributed to the efficient infilling of the massive paleovalley by the mid-Holocene. In a sequence stratigraphic context, this work provides an example of a major unconformity that developed late in the eustatic cycle (i.e., during early transgression rather than an earlier, protracted response to sealevel lowering) and in response to a perturbation originating in the catchment instead of changing accommodation in the basin. As such, it represents a geologically instantaneous time surface that can be used as a marker for stratigraphic correlation but one that is not in phase with eustatic sea-level fall.					; Goodbred, Steven/A-1737-2011; Schwenk, Tilmann/A-6324-2015; Grall, Céline/R-8572-2017; Grall, C.

Dynamics of suspended sediment concentration and the impact on a lake-inhabiting bivalve (Corbicula japonica) in the Abashiri River basin, Hokkaido, northern Japan	GEO-ENVIRONMENT AND LANDSCAPE EVOLUTION II: EVOLUTION, MONITORING, SIMULATION, MANAGEMENT AND REMEDIATION OF THE GEOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT AND LANDSCAPE	WIT Transactions on Ecology and the Environment				2nd International Conference on Evolution, Monitoring, Simulation, Management and Remediation of the Geological Environment and Landscape	JUN 06-08, 2006	Rhodes, GREECE	Wessex Inst Technol, Complutense Univ, Municipal Rhodes, Technol Educ Inst Kavala, WIT Transact Ecol & Environm				The dynamics of suspended sediment and the impact on a lake-inhabiting bivalve were studied in the Abashiri River basin, in eastern Hokkaido, northern Japan. The Japanese bivalve: Corbicula japonica is the most important fishery resource in Abashiri Lake. Torrential rain over 80 mm per day resulted in considerable sediment concentration during the summer of 2003. Suspended sediment (SS) concentrations > 1600 mg/l were measured in the tributaries, where fragile rock formations and faults had developed. The factors influencing SS concentration were analyzed by multiple regression analysis. This led to the identification of soft bedrock and fault densities as significant factors influencing sediment concentration. Fine-sediment particles less than 0.063 min in diameter accounted for more than 80% of the samples at all stations. Since the lake bivalve prefers coarse substrates, a negative relationship was observed between the percent of fine sediment and the C japonica distribution and fatness. The substrate around the mouth of the river was also composed of fine sediment, which indicated that the suspended sediment produced from the mountain tributaries has deteriorated the lake environment, especially for C japonica survival and growth.																			1743-3541		1-84564-168-X				2006	89						231	+																WOS:000238905000024

Spatio-temporal, ontogenetic and interindividual variation of age-0 diets in a population of yellow perch	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Dietary niches of fishes have traditionally been evaluated at the population level, with diet pattern central tendencies compared spatio-temporally among habitats and populations. More recently, however, studies have emphasised the importance of within-population diet variation and niche partitioning. Several studies have examined diets of young yellow perch (Perca flavescens) at the population level and have described an ontogenetic transition from zooplankton to benthic prey during the first year of life. However, independent of ontogenetic diet shifts, intrapopulation variation of young yellow perch diets remains largely unexplored. We quantified patterns of diet composition in age-0 yellow perch collected from Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron, USA during July-October, 2009 and 2010. We observed substantial variation in diet composition among individuals across and within sites, but found relatively weak evidence indicating an ontogenetic diet shift. Zooplankton were the dominant prey for age-0 yellow perch on most occasions, and individual diets were composed primarily of either zooplankton (e.g. Daphnia spp., Calanoida) or benthic (i.e. Chironomidae larvae, Chydoridae) prey. These patterns were not simply attributable to differences in prey availability and ontogenetic diet shifts, because a) not only diet composition, but also prey selectivity (Chesson's ) varied among sites and b) individual and spatial diet differences were evident independent of ontogeny. Within-cohort differences in diet composition may be an important, but often overlooked, phenomenon with implications for cumulative trophic interactions and intracohort growth and survival among young fish.

In particular, the vegetation cover status of lake wetlands has changed. Here, the change in vegetation cover at the estuary of Poyang Lake was monitored, and its influencing factors are studied to elucidate the dynamic change characteristics of vegetation at the inlet of this lake. Flood and water level changes are two of the main factors affecting the evolution of wetland vegetation at the estuary of Poyang Lake. Therefore, Landsat data from 2000 to 2019 were used to study the spatial and temporal variation in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in the vegetation cover area. Theil-Sen Median trend analysis and Mann-Kendall tests were used to study the long-term trend characteristics of NDVI. The response between NDVI and the explanatory variables at the estuary of Poyang Lake was quantified using regression tree analysis to study the regional climate, water level, and flood inundation duration. Results showed the following: (1) Vegetation in a large area of the study area improved significantly from 2000 to 2010 and only slightly from 2010 to 2019, and few areas with slight degradation of vegetation were found. In most of these areas, the vegetation from 2000 to 2010 exhibited a gradual change, from nothing to something, which started around 2004; (2) The main variable that separated the NDVI values was the mean water level in October. When the mean October water level was greater than 14.467 m, the study area was still flooded in October. Thus, the regional value of BestNDVI was approximately 0.3, indicating poor vegetation growth. When the mean water level in October was less than 14.467 m, the elevation of the study area was higher than the water level value, and after the water receded in October, the wetland vegetation exhibited autumn growth in that year. Thus, the vegetation in the study area grew more abundantly. These results could help manage and protect the degraded wetland ecology.

Trin ex Steudel) rhizome was studied at Lake Ferto/Neusiedler See using the litter bag technique. Samples were analysed for rhizome dry mass, fibre (cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin) and nutrient content (C, N, P and S), litter-associated fungal biomass, potential microbial respiration (electron transport activity: ETS) and cellulolitic bacteria. The mass loss of decomposing rhizome was rapid in the initial period and only 13.6% of the dry mass remained at the end of the experiment during 953 days. Substantial quantities of C, N, S and P were lost during 99 days; only 18% C, 19% N, 14% S and 6.4% of the P remained after 953 days. Hemicellulose degraded more rapidly than the other fibres whilst the lignin had the slowest rate of decomposition. Bacteria were found to be the primary colonizers of plant detritus, which was followed by fungal growth. An antagonistic relationship was observed between bacteria and fungi. Fungal biomass as determined by ergosterol concentrations ranged between 4.1 and 420 mu g g(-1) and peaked every year in September. The number of cellulolitic bacteria varied from 0 to 22 MPN g(-1) with higher values in summer. The ETS-activity ranged between 0.1 and 1.6 mg O-2 g(-1) h(-1). The changes in ETS-activity varied almost in parallel with the in situ temperature of the lake water.

J	Dittrich, M; Wehrli, B; Reichert, P				Dittrich, M.; Wehrli, B.; Reichert, P.			Lake sediments during the transient eutrophication period: Reactive-transport model and identifiability study	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												The modeling of diagenetic processes in the sediment of deep eutrophic lakes requires a dynamic approach covering seasonal changes to decadal trends. Due to the large base of scientific knowledge, the description of environmental systems is often based on complex simulation models that contain parameterizations of a large number of processes. The parameters of such models are usually not identifiable from a data set available for a specific system. In such situations, identifiability analysis techniques are useful in order to find identifiable subsets of parameters and to gain insight into the degree of non-identifiability. In this study a dynamic diagenetic model was developed to gain insight into the history of sedimentation and diagenetic processes in the sediments of Lake Zug, Switzerland. over the past 400 years. This reconstruction was constrained by measured data of 11 pore water concentration profiles, 6 particulate mass fractions in the sediment, sediment porosity and sediment core dating. According to the model, methanogenesis dominated the mineralization in the anoxic zone below the sediment-water interface with a fraction of 77% of organic matter degraded via this pathway. The contributions of Mn, Fe, and sulfate reduction to the organic matter degradation were less important (6%, 2%, and 15% respectively). The detailed analysis of an aerobic degradation at the sediment-water interface requires high-resolution measurements of dissolved substances. The model reproduced the main features of the seasonal variation of dissolved ammonia depth profiles quite well but failed to reproduce a sharp phosphate peak that was observed during summer, which indicates either spatial heterogeneity or short-term dynamics in the phosphorus release. Based on the time dependence of sedimentation fluxes, the model described changes in the accumulation of FeS in sediments from 1940 to 1994 as a result of increasing eutrophication, which opens the perspective for paleolimnological reconstructions based on quantitative diagenetic models. Based on identifiability analysis techniques this study shows that for a diagenetic model of the sediment of Lake Zug, an exceptionally large number of model parameters (25) can be identified from the available data. The result, based on numerical identifiability criteria, is verified by an automatic parameter estimation procedure. Furthermore, it is discussed if the identified parameter values are reasonable, or if the model parameters or model deficiencies that are fitted lead to a significant bias in their estimates.

Micaceous sandy sediments at the base of the profile indicate an active channel and humid conditions before similar to15,000 C-14 yr BP. The channel was abandoned during comparatively and conditions (15,000-13,000 C-14 yr BP) and converted into a swamp. Enhanced humidity around 13,000 C-14 yr BP led to submergence of marshes and establishment of a large lake. A dry phase is also identified around an estimated age of 11,50010,500 14C yr BP which might correspond to the Younger Dryas event witnessed globally. The Early to Mid-Holocene climatic optimum (similar to10,000-5800 C-14 yr BP) is characterised by a lake environment. Occurence of warmth loving aquatic plants, lower 6180 values of gastropod aragonite, heavier delta(13)C(org) values indicate a sensitive response of the lake ecology to the climatic warming and increased rainfall. This is followed by an and event during 5000-2000 C-14 yr BP and from similar to1700 C-14 yr BP there is evidence of. climatic amelioration. The sequence and magnitude of the millenium-scale climatic oscillations documented along the lake profile correlate well with records from other parts of the Indian subcontinent indicating that the recorded changes are an expression of broad scale, probably global and climatic change.

In this study, the bacterial communities of reed (Phraginites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steudel) rhizomes from healthy and declining stands were compared. Inner and outer rhizome surfaces were sampled. Samples were plated and isolated in September 1998 and June 1999. Phenotypic data of 371 bacterial strains were used for cluster analysis. Identification of phena was based on partial 16S rDNA sequence analysis of representative strains. Healthy reed stand rhizomes in fall 1998 were dominantly colonised by facultatively fermentative organisms, like Erwinia billingiae, Aeromonas sobria, Pantoea agglomerans, and Pseudomonas azotoformans. In the June 1999 sample, mainly Kocuria rosea and various Bacillus spp. dominated. In declining stands of September 1998, a saprotrophic community was found: Acinetobacter spp., Aeromonas hydrophila, Curtobacterium luteum, Agrobacterium vitis, and two further groups representing presumably new taxa. In June 1999, reed rhizomes were colonised by Kocuria rosea, but Dietzia maris and Bacillus cohnii could be isolated as well. Healthy and declining reed stand rhizomes can be distinguished based on the culturable bacterial community. No obligately plant pathogenic bacteria were found, however the possibility of a local, opportunistic bacterial invasion can not be ruled out (e.g. Curtobacterium). The presence of potentially beneficial bacterial species was demonstrated in the healthy reed rhizome rhizosphere (e.g. Pseudomonas azotoformans, Pantoea agglomerans).

J	Sherlock, RL				Sherlock, RL			Hydrothermal alteration of volcanic rocks at the McLaughlin gold deposit, northern California	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												The Plio-Pleistocene McLaughlin mine is a large hot-spring gold-silver-mercury deposit, located in the northern Coast Ranges of California. Two distinctly different suites of volcanic rocks host mineralization: an Upper Jurassic basalt, part of the Coast Range ophiolite; and an upper Cenozoic basaltic andesite, part of the Clear Lake Volcanic Field. The two suites of volcanic rocks range from least altered rocks showing primary igneous mineralogy, to intensely altered rocks composed of an assemblage of quartz, montmorillonite, sericite, and adularia. Mass balance calculations indicate almost total loss of Na, Ca, Mg, and Sr and large gains in K and Pa as a result of the hydrothermal alteration. The mass flux corresponds to the replacement of plagioclase feldspar with sericite and adularia, and mafic minerals with montmorillonite. Trace elements show no evidence for mobility. Rocks adjacent to the hydrothermal system have the greatest delta(18)O values and the highest calculated mass flux, suggesting the greatest degree of chemical exchange with the hydrothermal fluid. Rocks peripheral to the hydrothermal system have lower delta(18)O values that are a hybrid of primary magmatic values and values imposed by the hydrothermal alteration assemblage. These rocks also have calculated mass fluxes that reflect only partial exchange with the hydrothermal fluid.																			0008-4077	1480-3313				MAR	1996	33	3					493	508		10.1139/e96-038	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/e96-038													WOS:A1996UL40700011

Bacterial Communities and Antibiotic Resistance of Potential Pathogens Involved in Food Safety and Public Health in Fish and Water of Lake Karla, Thessaly, Greece	PATHOGENS												Bacterial communities, microbial populations, and antibiotic resistance of potential pathogens in the water and fish (Cyprinus carpio, flesh and gut) from different areas (A1, A2 and A3-A1 was linked with river water, A2 with cattle activity, and A3 with waters of a spring after heavy rains) of Lake Karla (Thessaly, Central Greece) were investigated. The isolated bacteria were identified using Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and were tested for resistance in 21 antibiotics. The microbiota composition of fish flesh was also studied using 16S amplicon-based sequencing Serratia fonticola and several species of Aeromonas (e.g., Aeromonas salmonicida, Aeromonas bestiarium, Aeromonas veronii, etc.) exhibited the highest abundances in all studied samples, while the microbiota profile between the three studied areas was similar, according to the culture-dependent analysis. Of them, S. fonticola was found to be resistant in the majority of the antibiotics for the water and fish (gut and flesh), mainly of the areas A1 and A2. Regarding 16S metabarcoding, the presence of Serratia and Aeromonas at genus level was confirmed, but they found at very lower abundances than those reported using the culture-dependent analysis. Finally, the TVC and the rest of the studied microbiological parameters were found at acceptable levels (4 log cfu/mL or cfu/g and 2-4 log cfu/mL or cfu/g, extremely low levels of E. coli/coliforms) in both water and fish flesh. Based on our findings, the water of Lake Karla would be used for activities such as irrigation, recreation and fishing, however, the development and implementation of a quality management tool for Lake Karla, to ensure environmental hygiene and prevention of zoonosis during the whole year, is imperative.					; Anagnostopoulos, Dimitrios/AAG-2601-2021; Kyritsi, Maria/ABA-6260-2021	PARLAPANI, FOTEINI/0000-0002-3905-5856; Kagalou, Ifigenia/0000-0003-2586-2611; Syropoulou, Faidra/0000-0003-1042-4838; Hadjichristodoulou, Christos/0000-0002-4769-8376; Anagnostopoulos, Dimitrios A./0000-0001-9867-2291; Boziaris, Ioannis/0000-0002-6420-6898; Kyritsi, Maria/0000-0002-4689-4623; 														2076-0817				DEC	2022	11	12							1473	10.3390/pathogens11121473	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens11121473								36558807					WOS:000902796600001

Ecosystem metabolism is well studied in ponds, lakes, estuaries, streams, and rivers, but it is seldom investigated in large reservoirs. Here, we report daily ecosystem metabolism (26 January-10 May 2009), measured with the free-water technique, in the surface layer of Xiangxi Bay, Three Gorges Reservoir. Further, we investigated the potential factors influencing variation in metabolic processes by systematically testing 4 hypotheses based on phytoplankton biomass, water temperature, nutrient concentration, and light availability. Daily dynamics of respiration (R), gross primary production (GPP), and net ecosystem production (NEP) had high variability during the spring phytoplankton blooms in Xiangxi Bay. GPP ranged from 0.57 to 9.79 mg O-2 L-1 d(-1); R ranged from 0.27 to 7.80 mg O-2 L-1 d(-1); and NEP ranged from -4.24 to 1.96 mg O-2 L-1 d(-1) (mean = -0.26 mg O-2 L-1 d(-1)). Further analysis showed that: 1) GPP is determined by phytoplankton biomass and maximum daily photosynthetically active radiation (PAR); 2) R is determined by phytoplankton biomass and water temperature; and 3) NEP has a significant positive correlation with soluble reactive P. However, the potential mechanism explaining the relationship between NEP and P requires further research. Our study reveals that the metabolic processes in Xiangxi Bay are determined mainly by phytoplankton biomass, water temperature, and maximum daily PAR. This work improves our understanding of ecosystem metabolism in Three Gorges Reservoir.					; Cai, Qinghua/F-8176-2015	Shen, Henglun/0000-0003-3235-4041; Cai, Qinghua/0000-0002-0224-7256													2161-9549	2161-9565				SEP	2016	35	3					826	833		10.1086/687205	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/687205													WOS:000381446500006

CO2 incorporation into the different types of microorganisms was studied at different depths, during diel cycles, and throughout the year. During winter holomixis, the whole lake became anoxic and both the anoxygenic and chemolithoautotrophic guilds were more active at the surface of the lake, whereas the activity of the oxygenic guild was negligible. During stratification, the latter guild was more active in the upper metalimnion, whereas the anoxygenic guild was more active in the lower metalimnion. Specific growth rates and doubling times were estimated for the most conspicuous phototrophic microorganisms. Doubling times for Cryptomonas phaseolus ranged between 0.5 and 192 days, whereas purple sulfur bacteria (Chromatiaceae-like) ranged between 1.5 and 238 days. These growth rates were similar to those calculated with a different approach in previous papers and indicate slow-growing populations with very large biomass. Overall, the annual total CO2 incorporation in Lake Ciso was 220 g C m(-2). Most of the CO2 incorporation, however, was due to the chemolithoautotrophic guild (61% during holomixis and 56% during stratification), followed by the anoxygenic phototrophic guild (35 and 19%, respectively) and the oxygenic phototrophs (4 and 25%, respectively), making dark carbon fixation the key process in the autotrophic metabolism of the lake.

Luminescence and radiocarbon dating demonstrate loess deposited in two periods: >11-8.6 ka and <5.1 ka. The 8.6-5.1 ka depositional hiatus, which coincides with the Mid-Holocene Climatic Optimum, is more similar to the loess deposition cessation in the TP than to the loess deposition deceleration in the CLP. Grain-size analysis suggests the Heye loess is a mixture of at least three different grain-size distributions and that it may derive from multiple sources. A greater proportion of coarse sediments in the older loess may indicate stronger winds compared with the more recent depositional period. Gravel incorporated into younger loess most likely comes from bedrock exposed in slump scarps. Human occupation of the catchment, for which the earliest evidence is 3.4 ka, postdates the onset of slumping; thus the slumps may have created a livable environment for humans.

J	Weyhenmeyer, GA				Weyhenmeyer, Gesa A.			Water chemical changes along a latitudinal gradient in relation to climate and atmospheric deposition	CLIMATIC CHANGE												Evaluating trends over time (nonparametric Mann-Kendall test) for 18 water chemical variables from 79 reference lakes, distributed all over Sweden, during spring since 1984 showed most significant trends for atmospheric deposition driven sulfate (SO4) concentrations. The decrease in SO4 concentrations was on average 2.7 times higher at lower (56 degrees N to 59 degrees N) than at higher latitudes (60 degrees N to 68 degrees N). This large difference in the rate of change between lower and higher latitudes could not solely be explained by atmospheric deposition as the rates of change in SO4 wet deposition differed by a factor of only 1.5 between lower and higher latitudes. Significantly higher rates of change at lower than at higher latitudes are known from the timing of lake ice breakup, a typical climate change indicator. The rates of change in the timing of lake ice breakup differed by a factor of 2.3 between lower and higher latitudes. Other water chemical variables showing significantly higher rates of change at lower than at higher latitudes were water color (a factor of 3.5), calcium (a factor of 2.9), magnesium (a factor of 5.5) and conductivity (a factor of 5.9). The rates of change of all these variables were strongly related to the rates of change in the timing of lake ice breakup along a latitudinal gradient (R-2=0.41-0.78,p < 0.05), suggesting that climatic changes can accelerate atmospheric driven changes at especially lower latitudes. This acceleration will result in more heterogeneous lake ecosystems along a latitudinal gradient.

High pH (>= 10) and elevated ammonia concentrations (>= 1 mg NH3-N/L) often occur during blooms of cyanobacteria (Aphanizomenon flos-aquae) in the lake, with major fish kills sometimes following a mid- or late-summer "crash" of the cyanobacterial population. Previous histopathology analyses and bacterial sampling indicated that infections of the pathogenic bacterium Flavobacterium columnare might contribute to the fish kills. We hypothesized that prior exposure to adverse water quality conditions increases the susceptibility of Lost River suckers to F. columnare infections. To test this, we exposed juvenile Lost River suckers to four sublethal ammonia concentrations at pH 9.4 for 62 d. On day 31, fish in half of the aquaria were exposed to F. columnare. As expected, survival of the Lost River suckers decreased in aquaria inoculated with F. columnare. Ninety-four percent of the fish that died were infected by F. columnare in the gills, kidney, or skin, whereas none of the survivors or unexposed control fish was infected. However, contrary to our hypothesis, survival of the fish exposed to F. columnare increased significantly (p < 0.05) as unionized ammonia concentrations increased. Our results suggest that complex interactions can complicate prediction of the responses of fish to concurrent chemical stressors and bacterial pathogens.

Mass balances of DIC and its 13C:12C yield estimates of CO2 gas exchange rates and net organic carbon production rates. Between 24 June and 13 August, the calculated CO2 gas invasion rate of 0.80 .times. 106 mol C d-1 is nearly equal to the river DIC inflow rate. The calculated epilimnetic net organic carbon production rate is 0.68 .times. 106 mol C d-1, about 20-30% of primary productivity estimated from 14C-fixation experiments and ETS-derived respiration rates. Metalimnetic and hypolimnetic DIC increase rates and porewater DIC gradients in hypolimnetic sediments indicate that remineralization of particulate organic carbon (POC) previously deposited in the sediments is a major (0.5 .times. 106 mol C d-1) DIC source to the lake during summer. For the whole year, summertime CO2 gas invasion balances wintertime CO2 gas evasion and DIC and POC outflow balance DIC and POC inflow rates, implying no net carbon burial in the sediments during 1980. This contrasts with the measured long term sedimentation-rate-derived carbon burial rate of 0.8 .times. 106 mol C d-1. Year-to-year variability in summertime primary production rates largely determines net gains or losses of carbon via CO2 gas exchange and sedimentation.

J	Mann, KC; Peck, JA; Peck, MC				Mann, Kristofer C.; Peck, John A.; Peck, Maia C.			Assessing dam pool sediment for understanding past, present and future watershed dynamics: An example from the Cuyahoga River, Ohio	ANTHROPOCENE												Dams can trap a stream's sediment load and create a sediment record of anthropogenic watershed impacts and stream sediment load variability. We demonstrate the usefulness of dam pool sediments in assessing past, present, and future watershed dynamics in this study of the Gorge Dam Pool, Cuyahoga River, Ohio. The 17.4-m-tall Gorge Dam was constructed in 1912 and subsequently trapped the sediment load of the Middle Cuyahoga River. 210Pb dating of the impoundment sediment allowed past anthropogenic impacts to be assessed. Mud accumulating between 1912 and 1926 has high trace metal content from industrial activities upstream of the impoundment. Between 1926 and 1978 mud having abundant coal combustion products (CCP) and high but variable metal content accumulated. During this period, sediment accumulation increased due to urbanization in the watershed. Since 1978 CCP and trace metals decline, reflecting the effectiveness of environmental regulations. Sediment accumulation increased dramatically between 2004 and 2008 and again in 2011 as a result of increased extreme flow events. An impoundment sediment accumulation of 7520 tonnes yr(-1) for the 210Pb-dated year 2006 is similar to a watershed model estimate of 7490 tonnes yr(-1) determined from year 2006 landcover and supports the use of watershed modeling to estimate sediment load. Dam removal to reestablish river connectivity also eliminates the impoundment sediment trap. The impoundment sediment load record allows for a projection to the downstream sediment load following dam removal. The potential removal of the Gorge Dam will result in a minimal increase to the Lower Cuyahoga River sediment load. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Modelling lake cyanobacterial blooms: Disentangling the climate-driven impacts of changing mixed depth and water temperature	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Climate change is already having profound impacts upon the state and dynamics of lake ecosystems globally. A specific concern is that climate change will continue to promote the growth of phytoplankton, particularly blooms of toxic cyanobacteria, via lake physical processes including warming surface waters and shallowing of the mixed layer. These two mechanisms will have different impacts on lake phytoplankton communities, but their inter-connectedness has made it difficult to disentangle their independent effects. We fill this knowledge gap by performing 1666 numerical modelling experiments with the phytoplankton community model, PROTECH, in which we separated the independent effects on lake phytoplankton of temperature change and changes in the depth of the surface mixed layer. Given the large global abundance of small lakes (<1 km(2)) and the importance of their ecosystems in global processes and budgets, we used a small meso-eutrophic lake as an example study site for the modelling experiments. Increasing the lake temperature and positioning the mixed layer at a shallower depth had different ecological impacts, with warming typically resulting in more biomass and a dominance of cyanobacteria. The response to mixed depth shallowing depended on the original depth where mixing occurred. As anticipated, where the original mixed depth was moderate (4-6 m) and there was a simultaneous increase in water temperature, cyanobacterial biomass increased. However, when the same absolute difference in shallowing and temperature increase were applied to a deeper mixed depth (9-13 m), lower cyanobacterial biomass resulted, owing to poorer conditions for low-light tolerant cyanobacteria. Our study shows that the response of cyanobacterial blooms to climate-induced warming and shallowing of mixed layers in lakes around the world will not be universal, but rather will be system-specific, depending upon the average mixed layer depth of the lake in question and the light affinity of the dominant cyanobacteria species.					; Jones, Ian/AAE-8193-2022; Gray, Emma/JMR-1633-2023; Folkard, Andrew/E-4775-2014; Mackay, Eleanor/F-5490-2013	Gray, Emma/0000-0003-3074-1945; Folkard, Andrew/0000-0001-6713-2460; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				DEC	2019	64	12					2141	2155		10.1111/fwb.13402	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.13402		OCT 2019											WOS:000490023800001
J	Tan, GR; Ren, HL; Chen, HS				Tan, Gui-Rong; Ren, Hong-Li; Chen, Haishan			Quantifying synoptic eddy feedback onto the low-frequency flow associated with anomalous temperature events in January over China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												Using a linear dynamic operator and the daily National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis data, the linearized part of the synoptic eddy feedback onto the low-frequency flow(SELF) associated with cold/warm events in January over China is investigated. Composite stream function differences between the cold and warming events show that the anomalous temperature events are linked closely to the teleconnection pattern which is related to North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and accompanied with remarkable anomalies over Ural Mountain and the areas south to Lake Baikal. The significant eddy feedback exists as the episodes occur, which tends to induce a similar circulation pattern to the anomalous low-frequency flow associated with the temperature episodes. Further, a linear SELF operator is used to estimate quantitatively the linearized part of the eddy feedback on the low-frequency flow for the temperature events. Results show that the magnitude of the stream function anomalies (SFAs) induced by eddy forcing is bigger at higher latitudes than lower latitudes. The positive (negative) SFA can be induced where eddy-vorticity fluxes converge (diverge) into the anomalous cyclonic (anticyclonic) circulation. Further analysis of differences in eddy feedback strength suggests that synoptic eddy feedback is more effective for the cold events than that for the warm events over North Atlantic, Ural Mountain, and the areas south to Lake Baikal. The SFA anomaly pattern over Ural Mountain and Lake Baikal associated with the anomalous temperature events in China will disappear without considering the eddy feedback. It suggests that the eddy feedback plays a very important role in maintaining the low-frequency flow during the January anomalous temperature events.

Reproductive strategies of two invasive tilapia species Oreochromis mossambicus and Tilapia mariae in northern Australia	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The reproductive biology of two invasive tilapia species, Oreochromis mossambicus and Tilapia mariae, resident in freshwater habitats in north-eastern Australia was investigated. Oreochromis mossambicus exhibited plasticity in some of its life-history characteristics that enhanced its ability to occupy a range of habitats. These included a shallow, weed-choked, freshwater coastal drain that was subject to temperature and dissolved oxygen extremes and water-level fluctuations to cooler, relatively high-altitude impoundments. Adaptations to harsher conditions included a decreased total length (LT) and age (A) at 50% maturity (m50), short somatic growth intervals, early maturation and higher relative fecundities. Potential fecundity in both species was relatively low, but parental care ensured high survival rates of both eggs and larvae. No significant difference in the relative fecundity of T. mariae populations in a large impoundment and a coastal river was found, but there were significant differences in relative fecundities between several of the O. mossambicus populations sampled. Total length (LT) and age at 50% maturity of O. mossambicus populations varied considerably depending on habitat. The LTm50 and Am50 values for male and female O. mossambicus in a large impoundment were considerably greater than for those resident in a small coastal drain. Monthly gonad developmental stages and gonado-somatic indices suggested that in coastal areas, spawning of O. mossambicus and T. mariae occurred throughout most of the year while in cooler, high-altitude impoundments, spawning peaked in the warmer, summer months. The contribution these reproductive characteristics make to the success of both species as colonizers is discussed in the context of future control and management options for tilapia incursions in Australia.

The resulting infections resembled those observed among naturally infected hatchery and wild populations of Chinook salmon. Virus was detected as early as 4 d post-exposure (p.e.) and subsequently in all virus-exposed fish that died or that were examined at 14 d p.e. when the study was terminated. The greatest concentrations of virus, up to 10(8) plaque-forming units (pfu) ml(-1), were found in the ovarian fluid at 13 to 14 d p.e., but the virus was also found in high concentrations in the gill, kidney/spleen and plasma. In contrast, the virus was not recovered from unexposed control adult salmon that died or were sampled at the end of the study. Despite detecting concentrations of IHNV in excess of 10(7) pfu g(-1) of tissue, no specific microscopic lesions were found in IHNV-exposed compared to unexposed control salmon. The results of this initial study suggest that virus in the spawning environment, either from adult salmon or other sources, may contribute to its rapid spread among adult Chinook salmon, thereby considerably increasing the prevalence of IHNV infection in both wild and hatchery populations of adult Chinook salmon.

China is also a big consumer of lithium. By 2019, China's lithium consumption in the battery sector alone had reached 99x103 t, with an average annual growth rate of nearly 26%. China has become the world 's largest importer of lithium resources, showing a severely unbalanced relationship between supply and demand for lithium resources. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the prospecting, exploitation, and study of lithium resources in China. This study collected, organized, and summarized the data on the major lithium deposits in China, analyzed and compared the spatial-temporal distribution patterns, geological characteristics, and metallogenic regularity of these lithium deposits, and summarized the prospecting and research achievements over the last decade. The major lithium deposits in China are distributed in provinces and regions such as Qinghai, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Tibet, and Xinjiang. These deposits are mostly small in scale. According to different genetic types, this study divided lithium deposits into granitic pegmatite type, granite type, saline lake brine type, underground brine type, and sedimentary type, as well as new types including hot spring type and magmatic-hydrothermal type, and summarized the characteristics and key metallogenic factors of these different types of deposits. Sixteen metallogenic prospect areas of lithium deposits were delineated according to the deposit types and the distribution patterns of metallogenic belts. The paper introduced the research progress in major metallogenic models and lithium extraction techniques made over the past decade. Based on the comprehensive analysis of the prospecting potential of lithium deposits, the authors concluded that the future prospecting of lithium resources in China should focus on lithium metallogenic belts, the deep and peripheral areas of currently determined large-scale pegmatite-type lithium deposits, geophysical-geochemical anomalous areas with mineralization clues, and areas with developed large-scale low-grade associated granite-type and sedimentary lithium resources. The study aims to serve as a guide for the future prospecting of lithium deposits in China.(c) 2022 China Geology Editorial Office.

Predicting complete winter ice coverage at Lake George, New York	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												Ice records at Lake George, an oligotrophic and dimictic freshwater lake in upstate New York, United States reveal that it has failed to freeze over completely 13 times since 1990. This transition from annual to intermittent ice cover is analogous to many other dimictic freshwater lakes globally. Over 60 years of meteorological observations from a nearby airport are analysed and a complicated picture emerges when considering the specific characteristics of each year. For example, Lake George froze over in 1983 and 2007 despite the air temperature having a net warming effect on the lake in the month prior to ice-in. Simple machine learning classifiers are trained using local weather data to predict the presence of complete ice coverage on Lake George and are found to perform adequately compared to observations, with one configuration having an accuracy of 91%. Using downscaled data from a coupled-climate model through to 2,100, projections with the trained classifiers suggest complete ice coverage will be a phenomenon of the past by the mid-to-late 21st Century. Furthermore, by 2080-2,100 the mean air temperature is projected to warm up to +8.0 C under Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5. These projections will be of concern to the communities and policy makers of Lake George responsible for the management of the ecological and socio-economic systems.

J	Özsoy, S				Ozsoy, Sibel			Investigating Elementary School Students' Perceptions about Environment through Their Drawings	KURAM VE UYGULAMADA EGITIM BILIMLERI												The purpose of this study is to determine elementary school students' perceptions about environment through their drawings. The study was carried out during the spring semester of 2010-2011 academic year. A total of 429 elementary school students, including 68 fourth grade, 78 fifth grade, 97 sixth grade, 85 seventh grade, 101 eighth grade, participated in the study. The study was conducted by descriptive method and the data of the study were collected by draw-and-explain task. During the data collection students were asked to draw a picture of environment and explain their drawings. The results revealed that elementary school students usually draw humans, different kinds of plants and animals, constructions like houses and factories, abiotic factors such as mountains, lakes, sun in their drawings. Besides, 35.43% of students drew dirty, 59.21% of them drew clean and 5.36% of them drew both clean and dirty environments in their drawings. The results of the study also showed that with increasing age there is a decrease in the number of students drawing a clean environment and an increase in the number of students drawing a polluted environment. Students usually drew local environmental problems such as air pollution, soil pollution, water pollution and disordered urbanization. Based on the drawings it can be concluded that children see human as a part of the environment, think that they are affected by environmental problems as other living things and human based activities are the main causes of environmental problems.																			1303-0485					SPR	2012	12	2					1132	1139																WOS:000306065700027
J	RENBERG, I; KORSMAN, T; BIRKS, HJB				RENBERG, I; KORSMAN, T; BIRKS, HJB			PREHISTORIC INCREASES IN THE PH OF ACID-SENSITIVE SWEDISH LAKES CAUSED BY LAND-USE CHANGES	NATURE												IN the past few decades, there has been considerable debate about whether vegetational and soil changes associated with changing land-use can cause surface-water acidification in lakes1,2. Although it is now widely accepted that the severe and extensive acidification that has occurred recently in southern Scandinavia, northern Britain and North America3,4 has been chiefly caused by atmospheric acid deposition, the role of changing land-use for moderate acidification is still not fully understood5,6. Here we report analyses of sediment records from Swedish lakes, which provide evidence that land-use changes can have an important influence on the pH of acid-sensitive lakes. Following the expansion of an agrarian economy during the Iron Age (from about 2,500 years ago), pH increased from about 5.5 to about 6.5. Our results suggest that this pH increase was caused by burning, agriculture, forest grazing and other culture-related practices that increased the base saturation and pH of the soils, and enhanced the transport of base cations and nutrients from the soils to the surface waters, thus indicating these lakes may be naturally more acidic than had been thought. Following this period of alkalization, pH in many lakes fell to about 4.5 during the present century. Although cessation of former land-use practices could account for some of this change, the unprecedentedly low pH in recent years must be due predominantly to acid deposition.

J	Scriber, JM				Scriber, JM			Latitudinal and local geographic mosaics in host plant preferences as shaped by thermal units and voltinism in Papilio spp. (Lepidoptera)	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY					4th European Workshop on Invertebrate Ecophysiology	SEP 09-14, 2001	ST PETERSBURG STATE UNIV, ST PETERSBURG, RUSSIA		ST PETERSBURG STATE UNIV			Laboratory and field tests support the "voltinism-suitability hypothesis" of host selection at various latitudes as well as in local "cold pockets": The best hosts for rapid development will be selected by herbivorous insects under severe thermal constraints for completion of the generation before winter. Papilio canadensis and P. glaucus females do select the best hosts for rapid larval growth in Alaska and in southern Michigan, but not in northern Michigan and southern Ohio. In addition to latitudinal patterns, local host preferences of P. canadensis are described in relation to "phenological twisting" of leaf suitability for larval growth in cold pockets with "thermally constrained" growing season lengths. White ash leaves (Fraxinus americana) have the highest nutritional quality (relative to cherry, aspen, birch, and other local trees) throughout June and July for P. canadensis populations inside the cold pocket, but not outside. In all areas outside the cold pockets, even with bud-break occurring much later than other tree species, ash leaves rapidly decline in quality after mid-June and become one of the worse tree host species for larvae. This temperature-driven phenology difference creates a geographic mosaic in host plant suitability for herbivores. However, we also report here that the cold pocket of northern Michigan has basically disappeared since 1998. Implications of these changes are discussed in relation to voltinism and host plant selection. Various physiological and ecological adaptations to thermal unit constraints are evident with both species of naturally hybridizing butterflies (P. canadensis to the North and P. glaucus to the South). The rapid regional climate warming since 1998 in the Great Lakes region has allowed us to document some critical aspects of gene flow via analysis of independent "species-diagnostic" trait clines (including morphological, biochemical, and physiological characters). Narrower black bands on hind-wings, larger fore-wings, larval detoxification abilities for tulip tree leaves, behavioral preference of tulip tree leaves, and species-diagnostic allozymes such as PDG (x-linked) and HK (autosomal) provide evidence of these genodynamics. Laboratory hybridization studies (providing known reference groups) and field observations along the hybrid zone show that gene flow between P. glaucus and P. canadensis has recently been extensive across the historical hybrid zone.																				1802-8829					2002	99	2					225	239		10.14411/eje.2002.032	http://dx.doi.org/10.14411/eje.2002.032													WOS:000177174200014

D08112	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												[1] Predicting riverine discharge to the Arctic Ocean has become increasingly important because of the dominant role that river runoff plays in the freshwater balance of the Arctic Ocean, and the predicted high sensitivity of the region to global warming. The ability of land surface models to represent runoff and streamflow from northern river basins is critical to an understanding of the Arctic hydrologic cycle. A set of simulations with the land surface scheme VIC ( Variable Infiltration Capacity) implemented at 100 km EASE-Grid across the pan-Arctic domain was conducted to evaluate the model's representation of various hydrologic processes in the Arctic land region, and to provide a consistent baseline hydroclimatology for the region. The pan-Arctic drainage basin system was partitioned into 12 regions for purposes of model implementation and testing. Streamflow observations at various basin outlets, satellite-based snow cover extent, observed dates of lake freeze-up and break-up, and sited monitored summer permafrost maximum active layer thickness were used to evaluate various simulated hydrologic variables. The results indicate that the VIC model was able to reproduce these hydrologic processes in the Arctic region. A 21-year average river inflow ( 1979 - 1999) to the Arctic Ocean from the AORB ( Arctic Ocean River Basin) illustrated in Prowse and Flegg ( 2000), was estimated with the simulated streamflow as 3354 km(3)/yr, and 3596 km(3)/yr with the inclusion of the Arctic Archepelago, which are comparable to the previous estimates derived from the observed data.

This map has been used for designing sampling strategies for mapping critical loads of acidity for freshwaters. This paper evaluates the freshwater sensitivity map using a data set of water chemistry collected as part of the UK critical loads programme. Discriminant analysis was used to predict five critical load classes from information on geology and soil sensitivity for freshwater sites. This showed geology and soil information on correctly predict approximately 50% of all critical loads classes. In addition, 77% of sites fall within one critical loads class of that predicted Predictions may be improved by including other variables eg altitude and geographical location. Differences between lake, stream and reservoir sites are also examined Ranges of critical loads values were determined for each of the five classes of surface water sensitivity. While a trend in critical load values was evident between classes, there was significant overlap. A simplified sensitivity map with only three classes related more closely to critical loads values. The paper demonstrates the usefulness of the surface water sensitivity map for assessing acidification at a national scale, but highlights the difficulties of predicting critical loads for individual sensitive catchments using national data.					; Hall, Jane/A-4525-2011	Sparks, Tim/0000-0003-4382-7051; Allott, Timothy/0000-0001-7629-9537													0049-6979					DEC	1995	85	4					2443	2448		10.1007/BF01186200	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01186200													WOS:A1995UE15800096

Using Stable Water Isotope Composition (δ18O and δ2H) to Track the Interannual Responses of Arctic and Tropical Andean Water Bodies to Rising Air Temperatures	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Lakes in the Arctic and tropical Andes are experiencing some of the largest temperature increases on the planet with coeval marked limnological changes, but little data exist on water balance parameters from these regions. Here, we present a unique data set of water stable isotope composition (delta O-18 and delta H-2) from a suite of 49 water bodies in the Canadian Arctic (Resolute Bay, Cornwallis Island, and Cape Herschel, Ellesmere Island) and the tropical Andes (Cajas National Park, Ecuador) spanning various years from 2009 to 2016. We show that an increase in air temperature over the study period resulted in evaporative enrichment of water isotopes in most Arctic sites highlighting the significance of evaporative losses to small Arctic ponds during the prolonged ice-free summers now experienced in this part of the world. Exceptions include some Arctic waterbodies that received abundant snowmelt and large, ice-covered lakes less prone to evaporation. Data from the Andean lakes indicated evaporative effects were minimal due to abundant precipitation. These data, in combination with limnological records and paleolimnological research from each region, provide a holistic view on how freshwater ecosystems are responding to recent warming in climatically sensitive Arctic and Andean environments.					; Smol, John/A-8838-2015; Blais, Jules/AAV-2321-2020	Blais, Jules/0000-0002-7188-3598; Michelutti, Neal/0000-0002-5857-4811; 													2169-8953	2169-8961				APR	2022	127	4							e2021JG006719	10.1029/2021JG006719	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021JG006719													WOS:000783804400001

To do so, ecotourists are compared to general travelers visiting this area. A questionnaire was employed to collect data on visitor characteristics and motivations, responses to which were then analyzed via descriptive statistics, T-tests and principal component factor analysis. Results showed that 16% of the visitors to this area were classified as ecotourists, while the remainder general travelers. Five motivations displayed significant differences (P < 0.05) between these two types of tourists. Three social motives - boosting self-confidence, feeling at home away from home and being together with family - and two attraction motives - indoor sports and viewing unique landscapes of the CMBR (crater lake, waterfall, gorge and hot spring) - were significantly more important for general travelers (P < 0.05); while two social motives of experiencing the tranquility of the natural setting and the natural beauty of the landscape were relatively more important for ecotourists (P < 0.1). Results suggest that ecotourists have distinct and complicated attraction and social motives compared to general travelers visiting the CMBR. Results have useful implications for researchers interested in tourist motivations and behavior, as well as for managers who wish to focus their marketing strategies more effectively.

J							European Food Safety Authority	On the Evaluation of a new study related to the bioavailability of aluminium in food	EFSA JOURNAL												The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was asked to evaluate a new study provided by industry that reports on the bioavailability of aluminium from several aluminium compounds in the rat. EFSA was asked whether the scientific data provided by the study could trigger the revision of the safety evaluation performed by EFSA in 2008, for the different aluminium based food additives investigated in this report (in particular SALP acidic, also known as sodium aluminium phosphate, acidic form or E 541). In the new study, the oral bioavailability of aluminium was determined as the ratio of the fraction of radioactivity left in the carcass seven days after oral administration of the 26Al-labelled compound of interest over the fraction of radioactivity left in the carcass seven days after intravenous administration of 26Al-labelled aluminium citrate using accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). The results from the study show that the oral bioavailability of aluminium from twelve different aluminium-containing compounds, including the food additives aluminium sulphate, Allura Red AC aluminium lake (FD& C red 40 aluminium lake) and sodium aluminium silicate, ranges from 0.02 to 0.21%, and therefore falls within the overall 10-fold range of previously reported oral bioavailability values for aluminium from aluminium containing compounds. In the case of the two sodium aluminium phosphates, SALP acidic and SALP basic (KASAL), and aluminium metal, the measurements were below the limit of detection by AMS. In conclusion, the new study does not provide any additional information on the bioavailability of aluminium from aluminium-containing compounds that could modify the conclusions reached in 2008 by the Panel on Food Additives, Flavourings, Processing Aids and Food Contact Materials. Therefore, EFSA concludes that this study does not give reason to reconsider the previous safety evaluation of aluminium-based food additives authorised in the European Union performed by EFSA in 2008.

The stable isotope archive of Lake Pannon as a mirror of Late Miocene climate change	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Lake Parmon was a long-lived Miocene and Pliocene lake system in Central Europe with a famous endemic mollusc fauna. The radiation of melanopsid gastropods and dreissenid bivalves has been explained simply by the opportunity to settle empty ecological niches after the extinction of marine life at the end of the Middle Miocene. This model, however, fails to explain the offset in the timings of evolutionary pulses in different mollusc families. Stable isotope data (oxygen, carbon) indicate a strong climatic forcing on these radiations. Moreover, the investigated time span covers the well-known Vallesian optimum and subsequent crises in European terrestrial ecosystems during the Late Miocene. The new palaeoclimatic data on the strongly changing isotope patterns of mollusc aragonite of Lake Pannon might shed light on the mechanisms acting during this crucial period. According to the new interpretation, the early lake (similar to 11.6 Ma) was still influenced by the latest Middle Miocene dry spell. This phase coincided with a pronounced radiation of melanopsid gastropods. During the warm early Late Miocene (similar to 10 Ma) humidity increased and culminated in a phase with high summer precipitation. This caused a reorganisation of the coastal-deltaic faunas, suppressing the radiation of melanopsids. On the other hand, high nutrient loads favoured the dispersion of filter-feeding dreissenids. Despite steadily declining salinity, Lake Pannon remained an alkaline lake with pronounced stratification that was apparently periodically disrupted only during the humid early Late Miocene. A separation of the isotope data into genera and ecological guilds is the prerequisite for discussing overall trends of long-lived lake systems. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Egg thiamine status of Lake Ontario salmonines 1995-2004 with emphasis on lake trout	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Alewives (Alosa pseudoharengus), the major prey fish for Lake Ontario, contain thiaminase. They are associated with development of a thiamine deficiency in salmonines which greatly increases the potential for developing an early mortality syndrome (EMS). To assess the possible effects of thiamine deficiency on salmonine reproduction we measured egg thiamine concentrations for five species of Lake Ontario salmonines. From this we estimated the proportion of families susceptible to EMS based on whether they were below the ED20, the egg thiamine concentration associated with 20% mortality due to EMS. The ED20s were 1.52, 2.63, and 2.99 nmol/g egg for Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), and coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), respectively. Based on the proportion of fish having egg thiamine concentrations falling below the ED20, the risk of developing EMS in Lake Ontario was highest for lake trout, followed by coho (O. kisutch), and Chinook salmon, with the least risk for rainbow trout (O. mykiss). For lake trout from western Lake Ontario, mean egg thiamine concentration showed significant annual variability during 1994 to 2003, when the proportion of lake trout at risk of developing EMS based on ED20 ranged between 77 and 100%. Variation in the annual mean egg thiamine concentration for western Lake Ontario lake trout was positively related (p < 0.001, r(2) = 0.94) with indices of annual adult alewife biomass. While suggesting the possible involvement of density-dependent changes in alewives, the changes are small relative to egg thiamine concentrations when alewife are not part of the diet and are of insufficient magnitude to allow for natural reproduction by lake trout.

Modeling dissolved oxygen in a dredged Lake Erie tributary	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												A two-dimensional numerical model was developed to study dissolved oxygen (DO) kinetics in a dredged Lake Erie tributary. The model design was aimed to specifically address the fact that many tributaries to the Great Lakes are dredged periodically for navigation, and that resultant changes in morphology and hydraulics can have significant impacts on DO. Due to the greater depths caused by dredging, river velocities slow considerably and vertical mixing is not as effective, leading to thermal stratification and potential short-circuiting of warmer upstream flow. The model solves the two-dimensional (laterally averaged) hydrodynamic and mass balance equations to simulate transport and transformation relevant to dissolved oxygen using an alternating direction, implicit finite difference method. Effects of oxygen-demanding pollutants from municipal and industrial discharges and also from nonpoint sources are included. A model application was developed for the Black River (Ohio), a tributary of Lake Erie. The river is dredged periodically, becomes stratified during the low flow summer months, and is affected by changing lake levels associated with seiching in Lake Erie. After calibration and confirmation, the model was used as a diagnostic tool to understand the impact of various loading sources on low DO levels observed along the bottom of the river. It is shown that sediment oxygen demand (SOD), combined with the river hydraulics, is the primary cause for low DO levels in the Black River.																			0380-1330					MAR	2007	33	1					62	82		10.3394/0380-1330(2007)33[62:MDOIAD]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3394/0380-1330(2007)33[62:MDOIAD]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000245692400006

However, isotopic modelling of sub-cloud evaporation in humid climates and its implications for hydrological processes remain poorly understood, posing challenges for regional water resource management and ecological conservation. In this study, a comprehensive assessment was conducted to understand the influence of sub-cloud evaporation on precipitation isotopes in Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China. Using 4-year hourly meteorological observations from 11 national meteorological stations, we found that there was significant sub-cloud evaporation during the precipitation process in humid regions. The remaining fraction of evaporated raindrops varied between 81% and 95%, with the lowest values occurring in September and the highest in February. The monthly average triangle delta 2H, triangle delta 18O and triangle d-excess values ranged from 2.9 parts per thousand to 7.0 parts per thousand, 0.7 parts per thousand to 1.8 parts per thousand, and -7.7 parts per thousand to -2.8 parts per thousand, respectively, and the sub-cloud evaporation effect during the rainy season was more intense than that during the dry season. By modifying the sub-cloud evaporation effect, precipitation isotopes monitored at the surface and estimated at the cloud base were confirmed to exhibit consistent temporal patterns on both monthly and daily scales. Sensitivity analysis revealed that precipitation isotopic changes were more sensitive to fluctuations in relative humidity and precipitation intensity under varying meteorological scenarios. The underrepresentation of low-intensity precipitation events was found to lead to a statistical underestimation of precipitation isotopic changes, and when the low-intensity events (<= 1.0 mm/h) were excluded, the average triangle delta 18O and triangle d-excess values shifted from 1.25 parts per thousand and -5.25 parts per thousand to 0.63 parts per thousand and -2.72 parts per thousand, respectively. These findings contribute to a better understanding of hydrological cycle processes in Poyang Lake and other regions with similar humid climate characteristics, especially for the interpretation of regional paleohydrological records and ecohydrological mechanisms using stable isotopes.

J	STAUFFER, RE				STAUFFER, RE			EFFICIENT ESTIMATION OF TEMPERATURE DISTRIBUTION, HEAT-STORAGE, THERMOCLINE MIGRATION AND VERTICAL EDDY CONDUCTIVITIES IN STRATIFIED LAKES	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Factorial designs were used to investigate the spatial and temporal components of temperature sampling error in two medium-sized (maximum fetch = 9 and 11 km; maximum depth = 24 and 70 m) Wisconsin lakes (Mendota and Green). Sampling designs were then optimized for estimating temperature distributions, thermocline migration, lake heat content, and vertical eddy conductivities in these and similar stratified lakes. 2. Errors were at a minimum for: (i) isotherms positioned 1/3 - 1/2 of the way down through the seasonal thermocline; (ii) at lake stations located near the node of the principal internal seiche; (iii) after an extended interval of low windpower. If seven spatially distributed lake stations were sampled n1, n2 times during the two low-power intervals bracketing a weather front, and the time delay between revisits was randomized with respect to the period of the uninodal temperature seiches, the resulting standard error (cm) in DELTA-Z17BAR (depth of 17-degrees isotherm; an unbiased, minimum-variance estimator for main thermocline migration) was (144/n1 + 144/n2)1/2. If n1 = n2 = 2 'revisits', the resulting CV (coefficient of variation) was 5-10% for DELTA-Z17BAR accompanying major individual cold fronts in early summer. 3. When estimating K(z), the vertical eddy conductivity, the most important component of error relates to DELTA-H(z), the change in heat content below depth z. The error in DELTA-H(z) is minimized in the same manner as for lake-mean isotherm depth. Using the Mendota sampling design described above, the RMS error in DELTA-H(z) decreases from approximately 90 cal cm-2 in the upper metalimnion to approximately 35 cal cm-2 near the base of the metalimnion. For seven lake stations, and n1 = n2 = 2, K(z) can be estimated with a CV approximately 10% bracketing a single major cold front. The CV decreases approximately as DELTA-H(z)-1, hence is roughly proportional to DELTA-t-1 or to (cumulative windpower)-1.																			0046-5070					JUN	1992	27	3					307	326		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1992.tb00542.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1992.tb00542.x													WOS:A1992JF94000001

Reconstructing Turbidity in a Glacially Influenced Lake Using the Landsat TM and ETM plus Surface Reflectance Climate Data Record Archive, Lake Clark, Alaska	Remote Sensing												Lake Clark is an important nursery lake for sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) in the headwaters of Bristol Bay, Alaska, the most productive wild salmon fishery in the world. Reductions in water clarity within Alaska lake systems as a result of increased glacial runoff have been shown to reduce salmon production via reduced abundance of zooplankton and macroinvertebrates. In this study, we reconstruct long-term, lake-wide water clarity for Lake Clark using the Landsat TM and ETM+ surface reflectance products (1985-2014) and in situ water clarity data collected between 2009 and 2013. Analysis of a Landsat scene acquired in 2009, coincident with in situ measurements in the lake, and uncertainty analysis with four scenes acquired within two weeks of field data collection showed that Band 3 surface reflectance was the best indicator of turbidity (r(2) = 0.55, RMSE << 0.01). We then processed 151 (98 partial- and 53 whole-lake) Landsat scenes using this relation and detected no significant long-term trend in mean turbidity for Lake Clark between 1991 and 2014. We did, however, detect interannual variation that exhibited a non-significant (r(2) = 0.20) but positive correlation (r = 0.20) with regional mean summer air temperature and found the month of May exhibited a significant positive trend (r(2) = 0.68, p = 0.02) in turbidity between 2000 and 2014. This study demonstrates the utility of hindcasting turbidity in a glacially influenced lake using the Landsat surface reflectance products. It may also help land and resource managers reconstruct turbidity records for lakes that lack in situ monitoring, and may be useful in predicting future water clarity conditions based on projected climate scenarios.

In this study, we examined the impact of golden shiners (Notemigonus crysoleucas) on zooplankton, ciliates, phytoplankton and nutrients. We conducted a mesocosm experiment using treatments with and without golden shiners with three replicates per treatment in summer. We monitored plankton and nutrient dynamics in these mesocosms for 6 weeks. Total macrozooplankton biomass acid the proportion of large crustaceans decreased dramatically in the golden shiner treatment, while rotifer biomass decreased only in the second half of the experiment. In the mesocosms with golden shiners, total ciliate biovolume increased. However, the impact of golden shiners on ciliates was species specific. Chlorophyll a concentrations increased and dissolved nutrients (inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus) were statistically unaffected in the golden shiner treatment. This experiment showed that golden shiners had a strong negative impact on macrozooplankton, a variable impact on rotifers, weak positive impacts on ciliates and phytoplankton, and no discernible impact on dissolved inorganic nutrient concentrations.

J	FEDERLE, TW; VESTAL, JR				FEDERLE, TW; VESTAL, JR			MICROBIAL COLONIZATION AND DECOMPOSITION OF CAREX LITTER IN AN ARCTIC LAKE	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												The decomposition and microbial colonization of Carex leaf litter were examined in an arctic lake in Alaska [USA] during the summer of 1978. Dried leaf segments in screen bags were placed at various locations and depths for 13 and 26 days. Weight loss varied from 24.15-33.56% and from 27.69-65.01% after 13 and 26 days, respectively. Abiotic controls lost approximately 19.5% with no subsequent change. Weight loss significant correlated with microbial colonization as measured by alkaline phosphatase activity (r [correlation coefficient] = 0.78), cellulase activity (r = 0.613), heterotrophic CO2 fixation (r = 0.835) and acetate incorporation into microbial lipids (r = 0.618). Alkaline phosphase activity correlated with cellulase activity (r = 0.889), and heterotrophic CO2 fixation correlated with acetate incorporation into lipids (r = 0.712). Weight loss after 26 days inversely correlated with the logarithm of the depth of incubation regardless of whether incubation occurred on the sediment surface or in the water column. A rapid initial period of microbial colonization may be driven by nutrients derived from the litter and the rate of these processes may be controlled by a factor(s) inversely related to the logarithm of depth, such as light intensity, primary production or turbulence.																			0099-2240	1098-5336					1980	39	4					888	893		10.1128/AEM.39.4.888-893.1980	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.39.4.888-893.1980								16345553					WOS:A1980JR27900036

After satisfactory validations for the lake meteorology and hydrodynamics during 2010-2019, historical and future predictions based on a downscaled climate model for the Great Lakes region under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios are used to drive the Finite-Volume Community Ocean Model applied to Lake Michigan during the ice-free months of 2010-2069. Substantial rises in lake surface current speed during May-June and September-October are connected to the rising wind speed and air temperature in the lake domain. Under the RCP 4.5 scenario, the study expects a 6.5% per decade relative increase in surface current speed, with a rise of 1.3% in the coastal circulation (within 50-m depth from the coast) until 2050. Surface circulation strength can reach the highest rise (13%) during 2030-2039 and a slight drop (-1%) during 2050-2069. During May-December, only a 0.3% variation is predicted in current magnitudes under RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. The projections anticipate the occurrence of a stronger, wider, and northward shifting lake gyre with changing lake meteorology. Further analysis indicates that the reduced thermal gradient over the lake surface tends to resist sharp modulations in winds and lake dynamics in the successive decades.

J	Wang, P; Yu, JJ; Zhang, YC; Liu, CM				Wang, Ping; Yu, Jingjie; Zhang, Yichi; Liu, Changming			Groundwater recharge and hydrogeochemical evolution in the Ejina Basin, northwest China	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Groundwater plays a dominant role in the eco-environmental protection of arid/semi-arid areas. Understanding sources and mechanisms of groundwater recharge in the Ejina Basin, an arid inland river basin in northwest China, is important for water resource planning in this ecologically sensitive area. In this study, 90 water samples were collected from rainfall, rivers and lakes, and springs and pumping wells in 2009. Analysis of the aquifer system and hydrological conditions, together with hydrogeochemical and isotope techniques were used to investigate groundwater sources and their associated recharge processes. Our results show that shallow phreatic and deep confined groundwater differ greatly in their compositions, with a distinct spatial heterogeneity of phreatic groundwater TDS (from 365 mg/L to 5833 mg/L), which increase along the shallow groundwater flow paths. Groundwater chemical evolution is mainly controlled by rock dominance and the evaporation-crystallization process, and the dominant anion species change systematically from HCO3 to SO4 to Cl, and the dissolved ions within the groundwater system from Na- and K-rich minerals and sulfate phases also contribute significantly to the groundwater composition. The stable isotope levels (delta O-18 and delta H-2) of the surface water and the shallow phreatic groundwater confirm that the Heihe River and Badain Jaran Desert groundwater are the main sources recharging the phreatic aquifer in the Ejina Basin. Thus, river infiltration and desert front recharge should be considered as the two main recharge mechanisms of the Ejina aquifer. However, recharge from the Badain Jaran Desert aquifer to the Ejina Basin has occurred at a lower rate due to acidification since the middle Holocene. For this reason, the sustainable improvement of the ecological environment should be based on the shallow groundwater recharge of the phreatic aquifer in the Ejina Delta, which mainly takes place via seepage through the riverbed and direct infiltration during periods of environmental flow control.

We report on a multidisciplinary stratigraphic study based on seismic reflection profiles and two sediment cores, aimed at providing information on the vegetational, lithological, and climate history of this area. Trace elements, palynology, macrofossils, organic carbon, and C isotopes, coupled with AMS C-14 dating, describe environmental changes from Late-Glacial to present. The base of the cores records a Late-Glacial steppic vegetation (Poaceae, Artemisia, Amaranthaceae), with dry and cold conditions and a high charcoal/pollen ratio. An ensuing shift to a warmer and moister climate is shown by the rise of Pinus and Quercus, and shallow water aquatics such as Nitella. Early Holocene warming, indicated by Quercus, Oleaceae, Corylus, and Betula, is followed by a hiatus suggesting one or more severe drought events between 9000 and 3000 yr BP. Late Holocene presence of Alnus and Fagus indicates increased moisture, probably in winter, which would have increased lake level. Heavy metal pollution indicators (Pb, Cu, Zn) in the upper portion of the cores imply industrialization. Due to its location, to intensive and uninterrupted anthropogenic impacts since proto historical times, and to its shallow depths, Lago Trasimeno provides an important observation point for climate and environmental changes in the central Mediterranean region during and before Holocene times.

Several hundreds of people were killed by the earthquake, some by indirect effects such as landslides and mudflows. A particular but nonfatal landslide triggered by the Kemin event was a rockslide in the vicinity of Ananevo, north of lake Issyk Kul (Kyrgyzstan) rockslide located above the fault zone activated in 1911. In the summer of 1999, a geophysical-seismological field trip was organized to study geology and to record seismic ground motions on and around the Ananevo rockslide. The work was part of project assessing seismogenic landslide hazard in northern Kyrgyzstan, based on various case studies of slope failures in connection with site-specific ground-motion dynamics. The geophysical investigations consisted of seismic refraction tests processed as 2D seismic tomographies and surface-wave inversion, which were combined to build a 3D geophysical model of the landslide site. Ground motions from small earthquakes were analyzed using several techniques to define site effects over the mountain massif. Both H/V and standard spectral ratios indicated lower dominant frequencies with stronger amplification in the crest region with respect to the mountain slope. These effects could be partially simulated by I D, 2D, and 3D finite-element modeling. By comparing the numerical results with the experimental data, the presence of a surficial low-velocity layer of varying thickness appeared to be the key factor controlling the ground motion around the rockslide.

J	Sand-Jensen, K; Moller, CL; Borum, J				Sand-Jensen, Kaj; Moller, Claus L.; Borum, Jens			High resistance of oligotrophic isoetid plants to oxic and anoxic dark exposure	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Small rosette plants in oligotrophic, softwater lakes, such as Lobelia dortmanna and Littorella uniflora, have highly permeable root surfaces that allow acquisition of CO2 from the sediment for photosynthesis. In the absence of an oxygen supply from photosynthesis, these permeable roots increase the risk that the plants are deprived of oxygen when sediments turn anoxic at night, or more permanently if there is organic enrichment. We hypothesised that isoetids, despite their preference for pristine, well-oxygenated habitats, should be relatively tolerant to tissue anoxia and that L.dortmanna should be more tolerant than L.uniflora because the impermeable leaf surfaces of L.dortmanna prevent the entry of oxygen from aerated lake waters and generate higher risks of anoxia in plant tissues at night. Metabolism, survival and subsequent growth of both species were unaffected by darkness under oxic conditions for 8days at 20 degrees C. All L.dortmanna individuals and 60% of L.uniflora individuals survived exposure to anoxic water in the dark for 5days. Anoxia reduced respiration during exposure, depressed the quantum efficiency of Photosystem (PS) II immediately after anoxic exposure and reduced growth during a 24-day recovery phase. Plant growth under recovery declined with increasing length of anoxia from 2 to 8days, and L.uniflora was more affected than L.dortmanna. Overall, the two species were very tolerant to oxic, dark exposure and also survived prolonged anoxia, probably because of inherently low respiratory maintenance costs. Lower metabolism of L.dortmanna than L.uniflora probably contributes to its higher tolerance to tissue anoxia, while higher leaf permeability to oxygen uptake from the water may help L.uniflora to survive recurrent sediment anoxia at night during summer.

J	Saggio, A; Imberger, J				Saggio, A; Imberger, J			Mixing and turbulent fluxes in the metallimnion of a stratified lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Turbulent mixing within the metalimnion of a stratified lake was investigated using a portable flux profiler (PFP) capable of resolving all three components of the velocities, the conductivity, and the temperature microstructure. Presented is a detailed description of the techniques used in the data processing, particularly in the separation of the turbulence from the internal wave signal. The sampling, carried out in Lake Kinneret (Israel) during the summer for 3 consecutive years, showed that most of the time the vertical flux through the metalimnion was negligible, but, at times, the eddy diffusivity did reach values as high as 10(-2) m(2) s(-1). A comparison between direct measurement of the vertical fluxes obtained from the PFP data with that from indirect estimates of the fluxes shows good agreement for the 6 less than or equal to Fr(gamma) < 100 range. Scaling of the turbulence based on Fr(<gamma>) and Ri reveal two classes of turbulent regimes: (1) due to traumata characteristic of internal wave-wave interaction and, another, (2) more energetic and due to shear-driven turbulence. The PFP penetrated the water relatively slowly (0.1 m s(-1)) allowing the measurement of temperature fluctuations down to 1 mm and, at the same time, also providing information of the velocity fluctuations. This is different from previous oceanographic measurements, which are always gathered with instrument traversing the water column at velocities closer to 1 m s(-1), preventing regime (1) from being detected.																			0024-3590					MAR	2001	46	2					392	409		10.4319/lo.2001.46.2.0392	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2001.46.2.0392													WOS:000167819900018

Effective aerial monitoring of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms is dependent on understanding cellular migration	HARMFUL ALGAE												Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CHABs) degrade water quality and may produce toxins. The distribution of CHABs can change rapidly due to variations in population dynamics and environmental conditions. Biological and ecological aspects of CHABs were studied in order to better understand CHABs dynamics. Field experiments were conducted near Hartington, Ontario, Canada in ponds dominated by Microcystis aeruginosa and CHABs floating experiments were conducted at Lake Taihu during the summers of 2015 and 2016. Single colonies composed of hundreds to thousands of cells with an average median of 0.2-0.5 mm in diameter were the basic form assumed by the Microcystis, and this remained the same throughout the growing season. Thorough mixing of the water column followed by calm conditions resulted in over 90% of the cyanobacteria floating after 1 h. Multiple colonies floated on the water surface in four types of assemblages: aggregates, ribbons, patches, and mats. It is the mats that are conventionally considered the blooming stage of cyanobacteria. Presence of CHABs on open water surfaces also depends on environmental influences such as direct and indirect wind effects. For example, field tests revealed that the surface coverage of CHABs can be reduced to half within an hour at wind speeds of 0.5 m/s. Because our findings indicated that blooming involves surface display of cyanobacteria essentially presenting as a two-dimensional plane under defined conditions, the use of surface imagery to quantify CHABs was justified. This is particularly important in light of the fact that traditional detection methods do not provide accurate distribution information. Nor do they portray CHABs events in a real-time manner due to limitations in on-demand surveillance and delays between sample time and analyzed results. Therefore, a new CHAB detection method using small unmanned aerial systems with consumer-grade cameras was developed at a maximum detection altitude of 80 m. When cyanobacteria were floating on the surface, CHABs detection through RGB band cameras and spectral enhancement techniques was efficient and accurate. Small unmanned aerial systems were capable of providing coverage up to 1 km(2) per mission and the short intervals between sampling and results (approx. 2 h) allowed for the rapid analysis of data and for implementing follow-up monitoring or treatments. This method is very cost-effective at an estimate of as low as $100 CAD per mission with an average cyanobacterial detection accuracy of 86%. Thus, it is a good candidate method to fill the urgent need for CHABs detection, providing cost effective, rapid, and accurate information to improve risk management at a local level as well as to help quickly allocate resources for purposes of mitigation.						lyu, pin/0000-0003-0865-7288													1568-9883	1878-1470				JUL	2019	87								101620	10.1016/j.hal.2019.101620	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2019.101620								31349882					WOS:000484873900003

Stable oxygen isotopes in chironomid and cladoceran remains as indicators for lake-water δ18O	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												An understanding of modern relationships between the stable oxygen isotope composition (delta O-18) of lake water and aquatic invertebrates is essential for the interpretation of paleoclimate records based on delta O-18 of organic remains of these organisms. We analyzed delta O-18 of lake water and invertebrate remains, including head capsules of chironomid larvae and resting eggs (ephippia) of planktonic Cladocera, in surface sediments from 31 large, deep, and stratified lakes along a latitudinal transect through Europe. The delta O-18 values measured for both lake water and aquatic invertebrate remains were compared to estimated delta O-18 in precipitation. A strong linear relationship between mean annual air temperature and delta O-18 of precipitation was observed along the north-south transect (r = 0.97), whereas the relationship between precipitation delta O-18 and lake-water delta O-18 was weaker (r = 0.80). A strong positive correlation was observed between delta O-18 in lake water and aquatic invertebrates (r = 0.95 and 0.94 for chironomids and cladocerans, respectively). Although slopes of linear regressions between lake-water delta O-18 and delta O-18 of both aquatic invertebrate groups are similar, a systematic offset between the absolute delta O-18 values of chironomids and cladocerans was observed; chironomids were on average 2.4 parts per thousand heavier than Cladocera. We attribute this offset to differences in ecology, metabolism, and/or behavior between benthic chironomid larvae and planktonic Cladocera. delta O-18 records based on subfossil chironomid and cladoceran remains have the potential to quantitatively characterize past lake-water delta O-18 and, indirectly, past climatic changes.

Diluted Bitumen Affects Multiple Physiological Systems in Sockeye Salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) Embryo to Juvenile Life Stages	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												An understanding of the risks associated with diluted bitumen (dilbit) transport through Pacific salmon habitat necessitates the identification and quantification of hazards posed to early life stages. Sockeye from the embryo to juvenile stage (8 months old) were exposed to four concentrations of the water-soluble fraction of Cold Lake dilbit (summer blend; concentrations of 0, 13.7, 34.7, and 124.5 mu g/L total polycyclic aromatic compounds). Significant mortality (up to 18% over controls) only occurred in the embryo to swim-up fry stage. Impaired growth was seen in the alevin, swim-up, and juvenile stages (maximum reduction 15% in mass but not fork length). Reductions in both critical (maximum 24% reductions) and burst (maximum 47% reductions) swimming speed in swim-up fry and juveniles were seen. Alterations in energy substrate reserves (reductions in soluble protein and glycogen content, elevations in whole-body lipid and triglyceride levels) at all stages may underlie the effects seen in swimming and growth. Dilbit exposure induced a preexercise physiological stress response that affected the recovery of postexercise biochemistry (cortisol, glycogen, lactate, triglyceride concentrations). The transcript abundance of the cytochrome P450 1A gene (cyp1a) was quantified in alevin head regions (containing the heart) and in the hearts of swim-up fry and juveniles and showed a concentration-dependent increase in the expression of cyp1a at all life stages.

In order to elucidate survive/fade of pathogens during the processes of wastewater treatment and reclamation, general indicators (fecal coliform and Escherichia coli), pathogenic bacteria (Salmonella and Shigella) and viruses (enterovirus, rotavirus and norovirus) were investigated in an A(2)O-MBR system. Attention was paid to their strengths from different sources, at various stages of the treatment, and in the product water. According to findings, black water was the main source for pathogens-at least 1-2-log higher in concentration than those from other sources. The preliminary treatment of wastewater by fine screens could bring about 0.2-0.4-log removal for almost all pathogens. The biological treatment units achieved almost identical removal (1.3-1.7-log) for bacteria and viruses. However, subsequent treatment in the membrane bioreactor showed varied removal for fecal coliform (4.7-log), E. coli (2.6-log) and the other pathogens (0.7-1.0-log), indicating that a high reduction of indicator bacteria may not imply equivalent removal of bacterial and viral pathogens. Chlorination was proved to be effective for eliminating all pathogens. In the artificial lake where the product water was stored, fecal coliform was not detected during the study period, but E. coli and pathogens were frequently detected, indicating that these bacterial and viral pathogens may be originating from non-fecal sources. On sunny summer days, the lake water could be bacteria-free due to sunlight radiation, but viruses were still detectable. Therefore, secondary disinfection may have to be adopted when the reclaimed water stored in such an open reservoir is supplied for strict reuse purposes.					; Wang, Xu/M-2766-2019; Xu, Limei/A-4848-2010	Ji, Zheng/0000-0001-8689-0240; Zhou, Jinhong/0000-0002-1253-8962; Wang, Xiaochang/0000-0003-1320-6326													0959-3993	1573-0972				JAN	2015	31	1					109	120		10.1007/s11274-014-1770-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-014-1770-5								25374337					WOS:000347298100011

Environmental variability in the monsoon-westerlies transition zone during the last 1200 years: lake sediment analyses from central Mongolia and supra-regional synthesis	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												A high resolution multi proxy (pollen, grain size, total organic carbon) record from a small mountain lake (Lake Khuisiin; 46.6 degrees N, 101.8 degrees E; 2270 m a.s.l.) in the south eastern Khangai Mountains of central Mongolia has been used to explore changes in vegetation and climate over the last 1200 years. The pollen data indicates that the vegetation changed from dry steppe dominated by Poaceae and Artemisia (ca AD 760-950), to Larix forest steppe (ca AD 950-1170), Larix Betula forest steppe (ca AD 1170-1380), meadow dominated by Cyperaceae and Poaceae (ca AD 1380-1830), and Larix Betula forest steppe (after similar to AD 1830). The cold-wet period between AD 1380 and 1830 may relate to the Little Ice Age. Environmental changes were generally subtle and climate change seems to have been the major driver of variations in vegetation until at least the early part of the 20th century, suggesting that either the level of human activity was generally low, or the relationship between human activity and vegetation did not alter substantially between AD 760 and 1830. A review of centennial scale moisture records from China and Mongolia revealed that most areas experienced major changes at ca AD 1500 and AD 1900. However, the moisture availability since AD 1500 varied between sites, with no clear regional pattern or relationship to present day conditions. Both the reconstructions and the moisture levels simulation on a millennium scale performed in the MPI Earth System Model indicate that the monsoon-westerlies transition area shows a greater climate variability than those areas influenced by the westerlies, or by the summer monsoon only.

J	SCHWINTZER, CR				SCHWINTZER, CR			NUTRIENT AND WATER LEVELS IN A SMALL MICHIGAN BOG WITH HIGH TREE MORTALITY	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												Bryant''s Bog [Michigan, USA] consists of 2 concentric zones, a free-floating and a grounded mat surrounding a central pool. The vegetation of the 2 zones differed in species composition, biomass and extent of tree mortality from 1969-1975. The grounded mat had less biomass and more tree mortality. Midsummer values in 1974 and 1975 of 17 chemical and physical parameters of shallow groundwater (15-30 cm below the surface) were not significantly different (P < 0.05) between the 2 zones or the 2 summers. The shallow groundwater had the low Ca + Mg concentrations characteristic of ombrotrophic bogs, moderately acid pH values characteristic of weakly minerotrophic bogs, and moderate concentrations of K, P and N. The Ca + Mg and pH values were comparable to those in 6 other bogs in the area while K, P and N concentrations were noticeably higher in Bryant''s Bog. The pattern of tree mortality was consistent with changes in water levels in lakes and streams in the region. Depth from the surface to the water level was significantly greater on the free than the grounded mat. Variations in water levels are the most probable cause of tree mortality and differences in vegetation of the 2 zones.																			0003-0031	1938-4238					1978	100	2					441	451		10.2307/2424844	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2424844													WOS:A1978GB73400020
J	Pedersen, L; Smith, T; Lee, SY; Cabrol, N				Pedersen, Liam; Smith, Trey; Lee, Susan Y.; Cabrol, Nathalie			Planetary LakeLander-A Robotic Sentinel to Monitor Remote Lakes	JOURNAL OF FIELD ROBOTICS												This field report describes the design and operations of the Planetary LakeLander (PLL) probe and its ground data systems. LakeLander's primary mission is to characterize the physical, chemical, and biological processes occurring in a high-altitude lake, and how they are being impacted by rapid deglaciation. LakeLander's secondary purpose is to test operation concepts for future exploration of Titan's lakes. The LakeLander probe is a permanently anchored buoy that measures both surface meteorology and water quality parameters in the top 40m of the water column. The concept of operations calls for the probe to continue collecting and downlinking data through the Andean winter, when the lake is inaccessible; this drives the power system design and forces a strong focus on system reliability, analogous to a space mission. The PLL ground data system provides the central archive of downlinked data. They are structured around a unified data-sharing web site that includes tools for mapping, data visualization, documentation, and numerical analysis. The web site provides a hub for engaging the science team and enables interdisciplinary collaboration. This report concludes with lessons learned during field deployment and several months of remote operations on the lake. Among the conclusions: (1) the choice to use an off-the-shelf profiling system has proven wise; (2) effective maintenance of a long-lived remote system requires extensive measurement, logging, and display of as many system variables as possible; and (3) the visualization sandbox component of the data-sharing web site has made numerical analysis of probe data much easier and more accessible to the entire interdisciplinary science team.

J	Lehman, JT; Abella, SEB; Litt, AH; Edmondson, WT				Lehman, JT; Abella, SEB; Litt, AH; Edmondson, WT			Fingerprints of biocomplexity: Taxon-specific growth of phytoplankton in relation to environmental factors	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Phytoplankton and environmental conditions in Lake Washington, Seattle, Washington, are discussed from the perspective of dynamic relationships between taxon-specific growth rates and environmental variables. More than four decades of measurements permit inspection of conditions associated with net increase and decrease for 40 phytoplankton species or species groups. Reproducible patterns exist for growth responses to over 25 environmental factors including nutrient chemistry, physical variables, and herbivorous zooplankton species. There appear to be no more than six main modalities of response to environmental factors, and responses to chemical and physical variables show coherence across taxa. Diatoms show a near uniform positive growth response to abundant inorganic nutrients, cold and transparent water, deep mixing, and intolerance for virtually all zooplankton grazers. Many chlorophytes and cyanobacteria show equally uniform growth responses to chemical and physical variables, although their preferences are virtually opposite from the diatoms. They benefit from the presence of copepods but show highly specific growth rate responses to different cladocerans and rotifers. Growth rate variations among the diatoms sort out along gradients of resource and physical factors, but there is coherence to the rise and fall of multiple species. Among the other algal divisions, despite a common set of physical and chemical conditions that promote growth rates, the species do not increase and decrease together. Instead, the prevailing grazer community appears to shape the phytoplankton community by admitting only certain species from the large pool of contenders.																			0024-3590					JUL	2004	49	4	2				1446	1456		10.4319/lo.2004.49.4_part_2.1446	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2004.49.4_part_2.1446													WOS:000224979800022

Denitrification Potential in Lake Sediment Increases Across a Gradient of Catchment Agriculture	ECOSYSTEMS												Intensification of catchment agriculture has increased nutrient loads and accelerated eutrophication in some lakes, often resulting in episodic harmful algal blooms or prolonged periods of anoxia. The influence of catchment agriculture on lake sediment denitrification capacity as a nitrogen (N) removal mechanism in lakes is largely unknown, particularly in contrast to research on denitrification in agricultural streams and rivers. We measured denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) to assess sediment denitrification potential in seven monomictic and three polymictic lakes that range in the proportion of agriculture in the catchment from 3 to 96% to determine if there is a link between agricultural land use in the lake catchment and sediment denitrification potential. We collected sediment cores for DEA measurements over 3 weeks in austral spring 2008 (October-November). Lake Okaro, with 96% catchment agriculture, had approximately 15 times higher DEA than Lake Tikitapu, with 3% catchment agriculture (232.2 +/- 55.9 vs. 15.9 +/- 4.5 mu g N gAF-DM-1 h(-1), respectively). Additionally, sediment denitrification potential increased with the proportion of catchment in agriculture (R-2 = 0.85, P < 0.001). Our data suggest that lakes retain a high capacity to remove excess N via denitrification under increasing N loads from higher proportions of catchment agriculture. However, evidence from the literature suggests that despite a high capacity for denitrification and longer water residence times, lakes with high N loads will still remove a smaller proportion of their N load. Lakes have a denitrification potential that reflects the condition of the lake catchment, but more measurements of in situ denitrification rates across lake catchments is necessary to determine if this capacity translates to high N removal rates.

B	Okafor, N	Okafor, N			Okafor, Nduka	Okafor, N		Ecology of Microorganisms in Freshwater	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY OF AQUATIC AND WASTE SYSTEMS												Freshwaters are defined as natural waters containing less than 1,000 mg per liter of dissolved solids, most often salt. Globally, freshwaters are scarce commodities and make up only 0.009% of the earth's total water. Although they generate only about 3% of the earth's total primary biological productivity, they contain about 40% of the world's known fish species. Natural freshwaters are classifiable into atmospheric, surface, and underground waters each type having a unique microbial ecology. Atmospheric waters lose their microorganisms as they fall as rain or snow. Surface freshwaters are found in rivers and lakes, and contain large and diverse groups of microorganisms. Using molecular methods such as 16S rRNA analysis, which enables the study of unculturable microorganisms, new information regarding freshwater microbial ecology has emerged in recent times: There are more phylogenetic groups of bacteria than are observed by cultural methods; there is a unique and distinct bacterial group, which can be termed "typical freshwater bacteria"; contrary to previous knowledge when aquatic bacteria were thought to be mostly Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria are in fact abundant in freshwaters; finally, marine-fresh-water transitional populations exist in coastal waters. Ground waters suffer contamination from chemicals and less from microorganisms; the deeper the groundwater, the less likely it is to contain microorganisms, which are filtered away by soil.																					978-94-007-1459-5				2011							111	122		10.1007/978-94-007-1460-1_5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-1460-1_5	10.1007/978-94-007-1460-1												WOS:000293760400005
J	Simon, J				Simon, Janek			Age, growth, and condition of European eel (Anguilla anguilla) from six lakes in the River Havel system (Germany)	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE					ICES Conference on Is There More to Eels than Slime	SEP, 2006	Maastricht, NETHERLANDS	ICES				A total of 199 female yellow European eels (Anguilla anguilla), 21.6-66.2 cm long and 3-14 years old, was collected by electro-fishing from six lakes in the River Havel system (Germany) in spring 2001. The condition and the growth rate, estimated by otolith increments, varied between eels within single lakes and between lakes. Fulton's condition factor ranged from 0.10 to 0.24 and the gross energy content varied between 4.3 and 15.3 MJ kg(-1). There were no significant differences in mean condition factor (0.16-0.18) or gross energy content (6.5-9.3 MJ kg(-1)) between lakes. Fastest growth was in Lake Blankensee (mean 5.3 cm year(-1)), and the slowest in Lake Sacrow (mean 4.0 cm year(-1)). For all lakes combined, the overall mean annual increment was estimated to be 4.5 cm year(-1). The biggest annual increment on the otoliths was generally laid down during the first and second years in fresh water, when the growth rate was 6.1-8.5 cm year(-1). Then, in the subsequent 12 years, the annual increment remained almost constant or decreased slightly (with lake-dependent values of between 1.6 and 6.8 cm year(-1)). In the River Havel system, the time between stocking of the lakes with glass eels and the recapture of eels at 45 cm body length was 7-10 years. The physiologically possible maximum length (L infinity values) of eels lay in the range 50-130 cm. In comparison with previous investigations (between the 1950s and the 1970s), the only difference observed was a trend towards slower growth.																			1054-3139	1095-9289				OCT	2007	64	7					1414	1422		10.1093/icesjms/fsm093	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/fsm093													WOS:000250901000015
J	Barrow, CJ; Hicham, H				Barrow, CJ; Hicham, H			Two complimentary and integrated land uses of the western High Atlas Mountains, Morocco: the potential for sustainable rural livelihoods	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												This paper examines the status of traditional agriculture in two areas of Azilal province in the Atlas Mountains, seeking to identify what is needed to counter any breakdown in livelihood strategies and improve the quality of life enjoyed by the farmers. Irrigated terrace agriculture is an important part of livelihood strategies in the areas studied and has the potential to be more productive and sustainable. In some areas it is reported to be endangered by socioeconomic changes and highland land degradation caused by excessive shifting cultivation, sheep and goat grazing, and charcoal production. Field visits made during summer 1998 to establish the condition of irrigated terrace and runoff agriculture and the factors affecting it showed that in at least: one of the villages supportive social capital has ensured that challenges are being met and beneficial innovations are being made. Considerable variation in success was evident from community to community, with some farmers maintaining adequate lifestyles and innovating, while in other communities prospects are less promising. The effects of structural adjustment have clearly been felt and may also have triggered some of the highland degradation and difficulties, which clearly threaten some irrigated terrace agriculture and other livelihood practices.

J	Loher, M; Reusch, A; Strasser, M				Loher, Markus; Reusch, Anna; Strasser, Michael			Long-term pockmark maintenance by fluid seepage and subsurface sediment mobilization - sedimentological investigations in Lake Neuchatel	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Pockmarks and mud volcanoes from marine and lacustrine environments are thought to be the surface expression of focused fluid flow (gas and/or water). However, the control fluid flow exerts on the sediment dynamics and rates of activity of such features, especially the maintenance and growth of pockmarks, is not well understood. This study suggests that variable fluid flow is the driving process that has maintained two lacustrine pockmarks over thousands of years. In Lake Neuchatel (western Switzerland), the currently active Chez-le-Bart Pockmark (diameter ca 160m, depth ca 10m) and the Treytel Pockmark (diameter ca 100m, depth ca 4m) indicate quiescent' fluid flow as well as past, eruptive', events of subsurface sediment mobilization. This study aims to test the hypothesis that phases of increased fluid flow through the pockmarks have led to the remobilization and spilling of sediment over the pockmark rims, and that different modes of activity phases are responsible for their maintenance and growth. So termed subsurface sediment mobilization deposits' are visible in seismic profiles and correlate to specific, sedimentary intervals in Kullenberg-type long piston cores. In a detailed analysis, different modes of transport are recognized, which are attributed to high-density flows that correspond to multiple pulses of activity. The pockmark morphology, seismic stratigraphy and core correlation with pre-existing data reveals that the two pockmarks have been maintained throughout the Holocene and underwent several switches between quiescent' and eruptive' mode activity.

In the present study, the extractable organic compounds from sediments in the Chaihe catchment of the Dianchi watershed were analyzed to characterize source inputs. Results show that the sediments are dominated by odd numbered n-alkanes (n-C-16-n-C-33), maximizing at n-C-17, n-C-29 and n-C-31. Aliphatic hydrocarbon may be composed of terrestrial plants and bacteria. The values of delta C-13(27), delta C-13(29) and delta C-13(31) of n-alkanes exhibit a range from -33.27 parts per thousand to -25.46 parts per thousand from -35.76 parts per thousand to -28.47 parts per thousand and from -33.67 parts per thousand to -27.42 parts per thousand, respectively and three records strongly covary with depth, falling within the range of C-3 plants in the study area. An isotopic model revealed C-3 plant contribution to sedimentary organic matter (OM) ranging from 40.75% to 97.22%. The values of ACL(27-33), CPI27-33, OEP, Paq, Pr/Ph, (C-27 + C-29)/2C(31), (C-21 + C-23 + C-25)/3C(17) and nC(26)(-)/nC(27)(+) are consistent with the C-3 plant predominance. A constant CRS model gave the accumulation rates ranging from 2.69 to 8.46 mm a(-1) spanning 1885-2010. It was concluded that OM transport in the Chaihe catchment was influenced strongly by human activities resulting in enhanced eutrophication. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Sensitivity to acidification of forest soils in two watersheds with contrasting hydrological regimes in the oil sands region of Alberta	PEDOSPHERE												Input of large amounts of N and S compounds into forest ecosystems through atmospheric deposition is a significant risk for soil acidification in the oil sands region of Alberta. We evaluated the sensitivity of forest soils to acidification in two watersheds (Lake 287 and Lake 185) with contrasting hydrological regimes as a part of a larger project assessing the role of N and S cycling in soil acidification in forest ecosystems. Fifty six forest soil samples were collected from the two watersheds by horizon from 10 monitoring plots dominated by either jack pine (Pinus banksiana) or aspen (Populus tremuloides). Soils in the two watersheds were extremely to moderately acidic with pH (CaCl2) ranging from 2.83 to 4.91. Soil acid-base chemistry variables such as pH, base saturation, Al saturation, and acid-buffering capacity measured using the acetic acid equilibrium procedure indicated that soils in Lake 287 were more acidified than those in Lake. 185. Acid-buffering capacity decreased in the order of forest floor > subsurface mineral soil > surface mineral soil. The most dramatic differences in percent Ca and Al saturations between the two watersheds were found in the surface mineral soil horizon. Percent Ca and Al saturation in the surface mineral soil in Lake 287 were 15% and 70%, respectively; the percent Ca saturation value fell within a critical range proposed in the literature that indicates soil acidification. Our results suggest that the soils in the two watersheds have low acid buffering capacity and would be sensitive to increased acidic deposition in the region.

The effects of these sediment-bound contaminants on the productivity of benthic macroinvertebrates are unclear. Sixteen locations along a pollution gradient were investigated in creeks in the Biesbosch floodplain area. Sediment samples were analyzed for bulk sediment characteristics and contaminants (total and bioavailable concentrations of trace metals, PAHs, and PCBs). Exclosures were used to study the effect of predation by fish and birds on macroinvertebrates. Macroinvertebrates were sampled and identified to species level, and production was estimated from biomass increases inside the exclosures during a 1-mo interval in spring. Benthic macroinvertebrate species richness was negatively affected by sediment contamination. Production of oligochaetes and chironomids was not correlated with levels of contamination, but production of gastropods was negatively correlated with contamination. Environmental variables that reflected food availability (seston and sediment organic C) were positively correlated with contamination. Predation significantly reduced invertebrate biomass, but the effects of predation and sediment contamination were not correlated with each other. Our study suggested that the moderate levels of contamination affected the structure but not the productivity of the benthic macroinvertebrate community, probably because of the counteracting effects of contamination and associated surplus of food.					; Peeters, Edwin/ABC-6307-2022	Peeters, Edwin T.H.M./0000-0003-2541-1829; 													0887-3593					SEP	2004	23	3					557	579		10.1899/0887-3593(2004)023<0557:SPAPAS>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1899/0887-3593(2004)023<0557:SPAPAS>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000224285100012

Todd			Temperature dependence of daily respiration and reaeration rates during baseflow conditions in a northeastern U.S. stream	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												Study region: Finger Lakes Region, New York, USA. Study focus: The relationship between stream temperature and daily respiration and reaeration rates was investigated from May 2015 - May 2016 for two sites, one in the headwaters and the other near the mouth of a net heterotrophic stream. Daily respiration and reaeration rates were calculated by applying the night time slope method to open-channel diel oxygen concentrations during baseflow conditions. New hydrological insights for the region: Reference values for activation energy (E-a) are presented that could be applicable to lower order streams in temperate climates receiving significant inputs from surface and subsurface flows. There was a sizeable difference in temperature sensitivity between upstream and downstream sites. Ecosystem respiration (ER) exhibited a strong Arrhenius temperature dependence with daily respiration rates of 0.5-9.5 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1) (E-a = 0.61 eV) in the headwaters and 1.8-30.3 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1) (E-a = 0.67 eV) at the downstream location where ER in the headwaters was less sensitive to temperature. E-a for both sites fell within the expected theoretical range for heterotrophic respiration in aquatic ecosystems. Temperature reaeration rate coefficients ranged from 1.011 to 1.020 at the headwaters and from 1.005 to 1.009 downstream suggesting that daily reaeration rates at the headwaters were more sensitive to temperature than the downstream location where reaeration was likely controlled by stream discharge and driven by turbulence.																				2214-5818				OCT	2018	19						250	264		10.1016/j.ejrh.2018.09.006	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2018.09.006													WOS:000451164000017
J	Yamaguchi, J; Kanno, Y; Chen, GX; Iwasaki, T				Yamaguchi, Junpei; Kanno, Yuki; Chen, Guixing; Iwasaki, Toshiki			Cold Air Mass Analysis of the Record-Breaking Cold Surge Event over East Asia in January 2016	JOURNAL OF THE METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN												An extreme cold surge event caused record-breaking low temperatures in East Asia during 20 - 25 January 2016. The planetary- and synoptic-scale feature of the event is investigated quantitatively using the isentropic cold air mass analysis with a threshold potential temperature of 280 K. Because cold air mass is an adiabatically conservative quantity, it is suitable for tracing and examining the extreme cold surges. We further introduced a metric named mean wind of cold air mass, which divides the factor of cold air mass evolution into convergence and advection parts. The new metric allowed us to trace the evolution of the cold air mass with dynamic consistency for a period of more than a week. A thick cold air mass built up over southern Sakha by a convergent cold air mass flow during 16 - 18 January. It migrated westward and reached Lake Baikal. On 20 January, an intense Siberian High developed, with an eastward-moving mid-upper-level ridge, producing a strong surface pressure gradient over the coastal regions of the Asian continent. This ridge and a cutoff low to the adjacent east formed a northerly flow in the mid-upper troposphere. The resultant southward flow through the troposphere blew the cold air mass over 480 hPa in thickness to the subtropical region of East Asia, causing strong cold surges there on 24 and 25 January. The abnormality of the event is further quantified using extreme value theory. The cold air mass gradually became rare along the path of the cold air mass from Lake Baikal to eastern China, which experienced as thick a cold air mass as once in 200 years. The cold air mass itself shows little change in thickness. Therefore, the migration of a cold air mass over 540 hPa in thickness from northern Siberia is the major cause of this cold surge extreme.

A steep-walled pit crater similar to 1 km across and similar to 200 in deep occupies the eastern part of the caldera. The island is the summit region of a mostly submarine stratovolcano. The oldest subaerial rocks (stage 1) are exposed low on the outer flanks and in the caldera walls. These include thick (similar to 10 m) and thin (2-3 in) lava flows, well-indurated tuffs, and scoria units that make up the bulk of the island. Rock compositions range from basaltic andesite to dacite, and most are plagioclase-phyric. On the steep north and south flanks of the volcano, these rocks are cut by numerous east-west-oriented, few-hundred-m-long lineaments of undetermined origin. Indurated breccias unconformably overlie scarps cut into stage I units low on the south flank. Intermediate-age eruptive units (stage 2) include caldera-filling lava flows and pyroclastic deposits and, on the outer flanks, vents and valley-filling lava flows. The youngest pre-2003 volcanic unit on Anatahan (stage 3) is a hydromagmatic surge and fall deposit rich in accretionary lapilli. Prior to 2003, this unit was found over almost the entire island, and in many places original depositional surfaces and outcrops could be found in high-energy environments along the coast, indicating a young (but undetermined) age. During reconnaissance visits in 1990, 1992, 1994, and 2001, geothermal activity (fumaroles as well as pits with boiling, sediment-laden pools) was observed in the southern part of the pit crater. In March and April 1990, increased local seismicity, a large regional earthquake, and reported increased fumarolic activity in the pit crater prompted evacuation of Anatahan village, at the west end of the island. Our first field investigation took place in late April 1990 to assess the level of volcanic unrest, conduct reconnaissance geological observations, collect rock and geothermal water samples, and set up a geophysical monitoring network. Results at this time were inconclusive with respect to determining whether the activity was anomalous. Water in some of the geothermal pits within the pit crater was boiling, and pH values as low as 0.7 were recorded in the field. An electronic distance measurement (EDM) network was installed, and over a similar to 1-week period, up to 9 cm of extension occurred across some lines but not others. Seismicity was characterized by intermittent local earthquakes but no sustained swarms or tremor. A brief visit in June 1990 revealed that the shallow lake near the boiling pits was gone, but activity in the pits themselves was similar to that of April 1990. Only minor extension had occurred along a single EDM line since the previous visit, and no earthquakes > M2.5 occurred during the visit. Subsequent 1- to 2-day visits occurred in October 1990, May 1992, May 1994, and June 2001. Activity within the geothermal pits was relatively constant during every visit, although during this I I-year period the level of the water in each pit decreased. In June 2001, a similar to 50-m-wide region of mud pots and steaming ground in the central part of the geothermal area had developed. No geologic evidence, however, suggested that an eruption would occur < 2 years afterward. Most of the EDM lines showed slight extension between late 1990 and 1992, followed by very gradual contraction from 1992 to 2001. A more extensive seismic-monitoring system was installed on the Northern Mariana Islands during these visits, and it recorded a small seismic swarm at Anatahan from May to July 1993. The telemetry component of the seismic equipment broke prior to 2001 and had not been repaired by the time of the May 2003 eruption, so no precursory seismic data were recorded to indicate preeruption unrest.

The characteristics of the four isolates were almost identical. The isolates were strictly aerobic and chemo-organotrophic. They were Gramnegative, non-motile cocci and coccobacilli, formed salmon-pink colonies on solidified media and produced BChl a and carotenoids only under aerobic growth conditions. The cells also produced small amounts of zinc-substituted BChl a when grown in the presence of 1 mM zinc sulfate. Anaerobic growth in the light was not found, but aerobic growth was stimulated by continuous incandescent illumination. The isolates grew in a pH range of 3.5-6.0. with ph optima of 4.5-5.0. A phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rDNA sequences showed that the isolates clustered in the major acidophilic group of the class Proteobacteria, which includes species of the genera Acidiphilium and Rhodopila. The anaerobic phototrophic bacterium Rhodopila globiformis was the closest relative to the new isolates (95% level of sequence similarity). The G+C content of the genomic DNA of the isolates was 69.1-69.8 mol%. On the basis of these results, it was concluded that the four isolates should be classified into a new genus and a new species, for which the name Acidisphaera rubrifaciens is proposed. The type strain is strain HS-AP3(T)(= JCM 10600(T)).

The sequence stratigraphy, palaeogeography, basin evolution, and coal accumulation of the lacustrine coal-bearing sequences in the Fuxin Formation were analysed based on borehole cores, well logs, and outcrop sections. Fifteen distinct lithofacies types were recognized with lithologies ranging from conglomerates, sandstones, siltstones, and mudstones to coals. Lithofacies are arranged into five facies associations representing alluvial fan, braided fluvial, meandering fluvial, fan delta, and lacustrine depositional systems. These facies associations collectively revealed a continental faulted basin setting. Based on the regional unconformities, basal scour surfaces of the incised valley fills sandstones, paleosols, or seat earths of coal seam on interfluves, and surfaces that mark abrupt depositional facies shifts, the Fuxin Formation was subdivided in two third-order sequences. Palaeogeographic maps of each sequence have been reconstructed based on the contours of lithological parameters. The palaeogeographic units include alluvial fan, alluvial plain, channel (braided and meandering fluvial), fan delta, and lake. Preferred coal-forming environments were mainly developed in the fan delta plain and fluvial back-swamp. Compared with Sequence 1, the activity of basin-margin faults and basement subsidence of the Sequence 2 gradually decreased, resulting in the lower rate of potential accommodation and less favourable conditions for peat accumulation. This background provided a basic understanding for the lacustrine basin evolution and coal accumulation. A six-phase evolution model was proposed, which includes lowstand systems tract, early transgressive systems tract, late transgressive systems tract, early highstand systems tract, late highstand systems tract, and falling stage systems tract. The early and late TST of Sequence 1 and Sequence 2 were relatively beneficial stages for peat accumulation and coal development in the Fuxin Basin.					; Shao, Longyi/AAS-9317-2020	Xu, Xiaotao/0000-0001-6618-5923; Shao, Longyi/0000-0001-9975-6091; 													0072-1050	1099-1034				FEB	2020	55	2					1195	1215		10.1002/gj.3483	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/gj.3483													WOS:000512877800010

Invasive macrophytes induce context-specific effects on oxygen,pH, and temperature in a hydropeaking reservoir	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Dense macrophyte beds are known to produce extreme diurnal oxygen and temperature conditions in shallow lakes. However their influences in managed hydropeaking reservoirs has received limited attention. We measured dissolved oxygen, pH and water temperature in the Lake Karapiro hydroreservoir, northern New Zealand, across a gradient of proportional water-column height occupied by the invasive macrophytesEgeria densaandCeratophyllum demersum, which dominated in the upper-riverine (variable water inflow) and lower-lacustrine (variable water level) sections, respectively. Hypoxia and anoxia events that occurred inside invasive macrophyte beds during their summer peak biomass accumulation period were more pronounced forC. demersumthan forE. densa, and within the bottom 20% of the water column. In contrast, pH and temperature changed little in relation to proportional macrophyte height. Macrophyte species differences in the production of hypoxia and anoxia events increased when site-specific hydropeaking management covariates (depth, inflows, water level) were accounted for. This association with hydropeaking likely resulted from contrasting hydrodynamics in the lower-lacustrine and upper-riverine lake sections, where oxygen can decrease with higher water levels and lower water inflow rates, respectively. During the course of our study, some macrophyte beds were treated with herbicide, enabling us to document prolonged and sustained hypoxic/anoxic conditions near the bottom following spraying. These results underscore the adverse effects of invasive macrophytes on water physicochemical attributes that sustain aquatic biota, and highlight the context-dependent nature of these effects moderated by reservoir management for hydropeaking and macrophyte control.					; Collier, Kevin/Q-9863-2017; Duggan, Ian/G-2275-2012	Clearwater, Susan/0000-0003-1739-0298; Collier, Kevin/0000-0002-5213-9907; Duggan, Ian/0000-0002-6037-9759; Moore, Tom/0000-0002-8373-627X													1535-1459	1535-1467				OCT	2020	36	8					1717	1729		10.1002/rra.3674	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.3674		JUL 2020											WOS:000552628500001

J.; Rautio, Milla; Laurion, Isabelle			Permafrost degradation and soil erosion as drivers of greenhouse gas emissions from tundra ponds	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Climate change poses a serious threat to permafrost integrity, with expected warmer winters and increased precipitation, both raising permafrost temperatures and active layer thickness. Under ice-rich conditions, this can lead to increased thermokarst activity and a consequential transfer of soil organic matter to tundra ponds. Although these ponds are known as hotspots for CO2 and CH4 emissions, the dominant carbon sources for the production of greenhouse gases (GHGs) are still poorly studied, leading to uncertainty about their positive feedback to climate warming. This study investigates the potential for lateral thermo-erosion to cause increased GHG emissions from small and shallow tundra ponds found in Arctic ice-wedge polygonal landscapes. Detailed mapping of fine-scale erosive features revealed their strong impact on pond limnological characteristics. In addition to increasing organic matter inputs, providing carbon to heterotrophic microorganisms responsible for GHG production, thermokarst soil erosion also increases shore instability and water turbidity, limiting the establishment of aquatic vegetation-conditions that greatly increase GHG emissions from these aquatic systems. Ponds with more than 40% of the shoreline affected by lateral erosion experienced significantly higher rates of GHG emissions (similar to 1200 mmol CO2 m-2 yr-1 and similar to 250 mmol CH4 m-2 yr-1) compared to ponds with no active shore erosion (similar to 30 mmol m-2 yr-1 for both GHG). Although most GHGs emitted as CO2 and CH4 had a modern radiocarbon signature, source apportionment models implied an increased importance of terrestrial carbon being emitted from ponds with erosive shorelines. If primary producers are unable to overcome the limitations associated with permafrost disturbances, this contribution of older carbon stocks may become more significant with rising permafrost temperatures.					; Prėskienis, Vilmantas/G-1630-2014; Fortier, Daniel/E-6965-2016	Rautio, Milla/0000-0002-2375-9082; Laurion, Isabelle/0000-0001-8694-3330; Fortier, Daniel/0000-0003-0908-6157; Preskienis, Vilmantas/0000-0002-8176-2263													1748-9326					JAN 1	2024	19	1							014072	10.1088/1748-9326/ad1433	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ad1433													WOS:001138588900001

In this paper, we present the results of a study of grain-size, geochemistry, pollen and algae of a middle to late Holocene sediment core from Haixing wetland, which located on the west coast of Bohai Bay. The results show that: 1) Prior to 6700 cal a B.P., the content of Cl, Sr/Ca ratio were the highest, endmember analysis of grain size suggested EM2 were dominant, which is characteristic of marine sediment and the concentrations of Pediastrum and Typha (indicating a freshwater environment) pollen were lowest, overall indicating the maximum of relative sea level; 2) During 6700-5000 cal a B.P., and the Ti and K contents, EM1 (lacustrine sedimentary component) increased substantially, EM2 decreased, and EM3 (fluvial sedimentary component) began to appear. The concentrations of Pediastrum, Dinophyceae and Typha pollen began to increase. All these indicating that the relative sea level began to fall and the study area became a lagoon environment; 3) During 5000-3500 cal a B.P. the Ti and K content increased further; EM1 was dominant, EM2 was rare, indicating that the relative sea level decreased further and the lagoon gradually became enclosed; 4) After 3500 cal a B.P., the Ti content reached its maximum and the Cl content and Sr/Ca ratio decreased to their lowest levels. EM1 was dominant and EM2 was virtually absent; dinoflagellate cysts almost disappeared and there was large increase of Typha pollen, indicating the complete exclusion of a marine influence during most of this period. However, during 2500-2000 cal a B.P. the Cl and the Sr/Ca ratio increased slightly once again, indicating a transient transgression.

In this study, the abundance, diversity and community structure of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) in riparian sediment of Zhenjiang ancient canal were investigated using amoA gene as a molecular biomarker. Clone libraries and qPCR (quantitative polymera se chain reaction) results indicated both abundance and diversity of AOB were higher than that of AOA, suggesting that AOB may play a more important role than AOA in nitrification process. The abundances, diversity and community structure of AOA and AOB had an obvious spatial variation in six different sampling sites, which may be attributed to the differences in sediment physico-chemical characteristics. 66.7%, 26.5% and 6.8% of the total 117 AOA gene sequences fell into the Nitrososphaera, Nitrosopumilus and Nitrosotalea cluster, whereas, 52.2% and 47.8% of the total 134 AOB amoA gene sequences belonged to the Nitrosomonas and Nitrosospira cluster. There was a strong positive relationship between the potential nitrification rates (PNRs) without ampicillin and bacterial amoA gene copy numbers, whereas no significant correlation between the archaeal amoA gene copy numbers and the PNRS without ampicillin. In addition, when ampicillin was added into the cultured systems in order to inhibit the bacteria, the values of PNRs decreased by 21.71%, 39.62%, 46.04%, 27.06%, 39.26% and 7.24%, respectively, for the Cl, C2, C3, C4, G5 and G6 samples sites, indicating that PNRs were apparently affected by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. These results further indicate that nitrification is more related to AOB than AOA in the riparian sediment of Zhenjiang ancient canal. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, potential endocrine system modulation caused by contaminant exposure has yet not been reported in this Arctic apical predator. In this present study we aimed to investigate whether the current levels of a selection of organochlorines (OCs) were associated with altered circulating levels of thyroid hormones (THs) in free-ranging adult glaucous gulls breeding at Bear Island in the Barents Sea. Blood concentrations of 14 polychlorinated biphenyls, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), oxychlordane, and p,p'-dichlorodiphenyidichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE) were quantified, in addition to free and total thyroxine (T-4) and triiodothyronine (T-3), in plasma of 66 glaucous gulls in the spring of 2001. Negative correlations were found between plasma levels of T-4 and T-4:T-3 ratio, and blood levels of OCs in male glaucous gulls. Despite their relatively low contribution to the total OC fraction, HCB and oxychlordane were the most prominent compounds in terms of their negative effect on the variation of the T4:T3 ratio. Moreover, lower T4 levels and T4:T3 ratios were measured in glaucous gulls breeding in a colony exposed to high levels of OCs, compared with a less exposed colony. Levels of T3 were elevated in the high-OC-exposed colony. This may indicate that the glaucous gull is susceptible to changes to TH homeostasis mediated by exposure to halogenated organic contaminants.

Asian carp spawning success: Predictions from a 3-D hydrodynamic model for a Laurentian Great Lake tributary	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Asian carps are threatening to establish in the Great Lakes basin and the examination of factors leading to spawning success is vital for preventive efforts. Hydrodynamic modelling can determine if successful hatching of carp eggs can occur in a tributary, by predicting egg movement during a spawning event to see if hatching can occur before eggs settle. A 3-D hydrodynamic model, coupled with a Lagrangian particle tracker, was used to assess hatching rates of three Asian carp species (bighead, grass, and silver carps) in different temperature and flow scenarios in the east Don River, a potential spawning tributary to Lake Ontario. In-river hatching rates were highest in scenarios with warmer summer water temperatures (23-25 degrees C) and flow magnitudes of 15-35 m(3)/s, which occur at least once every year. Using a 3-D hydrodynamic model allowed the inclusion of low-velocity zones where eggs become trapped in lower flow scenarios, thereby reducing modelled hatching success. In-river hatching rates were significantly reduced when the spawning location was moved close to the mouth of the river, with no modelled hatching if spawning occurred in the lower 8 km of the Don River, indicating that preventing Asian carp movement upstream would viably reduce the chances of successfully spawning occurring in this tributary. The magnitude of reduction in spawning success caused by limiting Asian carp passage upstream can guide preventative strategies and the method of using a 3-D hydrodynamic model as a predictive tool could be applied in similar tributaries across the Great Lakes basin.

Oxygen use by nitrification in the hypolimnion and sediments of Lake Erie	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Nitrification is an oxygen consumptive process, consuming 2 mol of oxygen per mol of ammonium oxidized. Hypolimnion and sediment samples were collected during the summers of 2008-2010 in Lake Erie to determine the total oxygen consumption and oxygen consumption from nitrification by blocking nitrification with selective inhibitors. Oxygen consumption by nitrification in the hypolimnion was 3.7 +/- 2.9 (mean +/- 1 SD) mu mol O-2/L/d, with nitrification accounting for 32.6 +/- 22.1% of the total oxygen consumption. Nitrification in the hypolimnion contributed more to oxygen consumption in the eastern sites than western sites and was lowest in September. The nitrification rate did not correlate with environmental factors such as oxygen, nitrate or ammonium, or nitrifier numbers. Oxygen consumption by nitrification in sediment slurries was 7.1 +/- 5.8 mu mol O-2/g/d, with nitrification accounting for 27.0 19.2% of the total oxygen consumption with the lowest rates in July and the lowest percentages in June. Oxygen consumption by nitrification in intact sediment cores was 682 +/- 61.1 mu mol O-2/m/d with nitrification accounting for 30.4 +/- 10.7% of the total oxygen consumption. Nitrification rates in intact cores were generally highest in September. The proportion of oxygen consumed by nitrification corresponds closely with what would be predicted from complete oxidation of a Redfield molecule (23%). While nitrification is unlikely to be the dominant oxygen consumptive process, the rates observed in Lake Erie were sufficient to theoretically deplete a large portion of the hypolimnetic oxygen pool during the stratified period.

J	Nelson, AR; Kashima, K; Bradley, LA				Nelson, Alan R.; Kashima, Kaoru; Bradley, Lee-Ann			Fragmentary Evidence of Great-Earthquake Subsidence during Holocene Emergence, Valdivia Estuary, South Central Chile	BULLETIN OF THE SEISMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												A reconnaissance of Holocene stratigraphy beneath fringing marshes of the Valdivia estuary, where an M 9.5 earthquake caused 1-2 m of regional coseismic subsidence in 1960, shows only fragmentary evidence of prehistoric coseismic subsidence. In most of the 150 hand-driven cores that were examined, a distinct unconformity separates 0.5-1.5 m of late Holocene tidal and floodplain mud, peat, and sand from underlying middle Holocene subtidal mud and sand. At the Las Coloradas site, where stratigraphy is best preserved, two A horizons of marsh and meadow soils abruptly overlain by sand and mud probably record coseismic subsidence shortly followed by tsunamis. The amount of subsidence during the earthquakes proved difficult to reconstruct with a diatom transfer function because of differences between modern and fossil diatom assemblages. Maximum C-14 ages on macrofossils from the two A horizons at the Las Coloradas site of 1.7-1.3 ka and 2.7-1.7 ka allow correlation of the younger horizon with either of two of six C-14-dated A horizons buried by tsunami sand or post-tsunami tidal sand 200 km to the south at Maullin, and with a lake-wide mass wasting event in Lago Puyehue, 100 km to the southeast. Tidal records of prehistoric coseismic subsidence at Valdivia are scarce because of a sea-level fall of 3-8 m over the past 6000 years, erosion of marsh and meadow soils during subsidence-induced flooding of the estuary, and largely complete land-level recovery during cycles of coseismic subsidence and postseismic uplift.																			0037-1106	1943-3573				FEB 1	2009	99	1					71	86		10.1785/0120080103	http://dx.doi.org/10.1785/0120080103													WOS:000266181100006

Impact of Plum pox virus (PPV-D) infection on peach tree growth, productivity and bud cold hardiness	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY												In 2000, the Dideron (D) strain of Plum pox virus (PPV) was detected in commercial peach and nectarine orchards in the Niagara region of Ontario where most of Canada's stone fruit crops are produced. As part of a disease management research programme, peach (Prunus persica L. Batsch) trees in a commercial orchard at Niagara-on-the-Lake were assayed for PPV annually for 3years. The orchard consisted of two blocks of the cultivars Allstar' and Brighton', of which 4 of 288 and 5 of 252 trees, respectively, were infected with PPV-D. The growth and health of these PPV-infected and non-infected trees were evaluated based on the annual growth rates, vigour (chlorophyll content) and bud winter hardiness. Comparative fruit quantity and quality index values were based on total yield and marketable yield per tree, fruit size and weight, fruit pH, titratable acidity, total soluble solids, flesh firmness, and fruit skin colour. Results from these preliminary studies showed that trees infected with this mild Ontario isolate of PPV produced slightly more fruit of smaller size that ripened earlier than non-infected trees. However, yield efficiencies based on weight of fruit relative to the trunk cross-sectional area did not differ statistically.

This eco-complex contains three very large salt pans (Chott Melghir, Chott Merouane and Chott Sidi Slimane), classified as wetlands of international importance according to the Ramsar convention and other small temporary wetlands such as: Chott Hamraia, Chott Tighdidine and Chott Tindle, and two permanent sites: Ayata and Oued Khrouf lakes. These aquatic ecosystems divided between wilayas of El-Oued, Biskra and Ouargla, have a great biological diversity due to their size, salinity and substrate. With a total area of 900000 ha, these wetlands remain very poorly studied in Algeria and their biological and ecological roles remain unknown. The bird fauna of wetlands complex of Oued Righ is very rich, where 53 species representing 15 families were assessed. They are dominated by the Greater Flamingo Phoenicopterus roseus, the Shoveler Anas clypeata, the Ruddy Shelduck Tadorna ferriginea, and the Teal Anas crecca crecca. Some species were observed with relatively large numbers (the Greater Flamingo, 42700) and other species are listed as endangered and vulnerable following the IUCN Red List such as: Marbled Teal Marmaronetta angustirostris, Ferruginous duck Aythya nyroca. Regular monitoring of this bird fauna allowed as defining the status and phenology of these species. Overall, the wetlands of Oued Righ depression are exploited as wintering grounds, stopover during migration journeys and breeding sites for several waterbirds species.

Lithofacies, stable isotopic composition, and stratigraphic evolution of microbial and associated carbonates, Green River Formation (Eocene), Piceance Basin, Colorado	AAPG BULLETIN												Lacustrine carbonates of the Eocene Green River Formation crop out on the western margin of the Piceance Basin and the eastern margin of the Uinta Basin, in western Colorado. This area allows tracing of vertical and horizontal facies variation over hundreds of meters. Limestone beds consist of littoral to sublittoral lithofacies: bioclastic and oolitic grainstones, oolitic wackestone, intraclastic rudstone, stromatolites, and thrombolites. Fades form upward-deepening cycles that start with sharp-based grainstones and packstones followed by stromatolites or thrombolites and capped by fine-grained stromatolites and/or oil shale deposits. The vertical succession of carbonate deposits correlates with evolutionary lake stages. The succession starts with grainstone deposits rich in ostracods and gastropods that correspond to an initial freshwater lake. Thrombolites capped by laminated stromatolites or coarse-agglutinated stromatolites correlate with a higher-salinity transitional lake. Deepening-upward cycles, as much as 5 m (16 ft) thick, of thrombolites, agglutinated stromatolites, and fine-grained stromatolites occur in the highly fluctuating lake. The upper section is dominated by laminated stromatolites that correspond to a rising lake. Stable isotope delta O-18 and delta C-13 values covary and range from -8 parts per thousand to +0.8 parts per thousand and -3 parts per thousand to +5 parts per thousand, respectively. The delta O-18 values indicate carbonate-precipitating water evolved from fresh to saline and became less saline in the upper Green River. Negative excursions of delta C-13 values correspond to lake level rises, and positive excursions of delta C-13 values occur during lake level falls. Syndepositional to burial diagenesis modified carbonate porosity. Early dissolution is followed by burial compaction and fracturing. Compaction and late calcite cements occluded primary and secondary porosity.					; Humphrey, John/AAN-1879-2021	Humphrey, John/0000-0002-8927-2322; 													0149-1423	1558-9153				NOV	2013	97	11			SI		1937	1966		10.1306/07031312188	http://dx.doi.org/10.1306/07031312188													WOS:000327000700006

MARINE ECOLOGY-AN EVOLUTIONARY PERSPECTIVE												The calycophoran siphonophore Muggiaea atlantica was recorded for the first time in the marine lakes of Mljet Island (South Adriatic) in 2001. The presence of M. atlantica in such semi-enclosed environments provided a unique opportunity to describe its life cycle based on in situ observations of the annual variability of its asexual nectophore stage, sexual eudoxid stage (produces gonophores) and calyconula larvae. Muggiaea atlantica was present the whole year in the Malo jezero (Small Lake, SL), where it was actively reproducing between May and September 2001, with a maximum density of gonophores in May (141 gonophores m(-3)) and nectophores and larvae in June (37 nectophores m(-3) and 80 larvae m(-3)). Higher temperatures below the thermocline (average 14.5-15.6 degrees C), and the availability of prey (e. g. small copepods, chaetognaths and bivalve larvae) were the main environmental factors related to successful reproduction of M. atlantica in SL. In the Veliko jezero (Great Lake, GL) nectophores and gonophores of M. atlantica were found in low numbers, mainly in the upper 20 m, between September and November 2001 and no larvae were recorded. In 2001, Muggiaea kochi, the sole calycophoran siphonophore previously reported in the GL, was not recorded in the Mljet lakes. We hypothesize that the cold (<13 degrees C) conditions over winter of 2000/2001 were not suitable for the warm-temperate M. kochi and may have favoured its cold-temperate congener, M. atlantica, which has progressively colonized the southern Adriatic since the mid-1990s.

J	Corio, K; Wolf, A; Draney, M; Fewless, G				Corio, Kathryn; Wolf, Amy; Draney, Michael; Fewless, Gary			Exotic earthworms of great lakes forests: A search for indicator plant species in maple forests	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												The invasion of exotic earthworms in previously earthworm-free northern deciduous forests has been linked to the disappearance of forest floor litter, declines in plant species richness, and the development of monotypic stands of Carex pensylvanica. However, the impact of exotic earthworms on the regeneration of trees and understory plants is largely unknown. We examined the relationships between earthworm density, plant species richness, leaf litter accumulation, number of tree (Acer) seedlings, and cover of C. pensylvanica at 14 sites in mesic hardwood forests of the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest in northern Wisconsin. Earthworm biomass, especially of the genera Lumbricus, Aporrectodea, and Octolasion was negatively associated with leaf litter mass and number of Acer seedlings. Nine plant species, including two spring ephemerals (Dicentra cucullaria and Osmorhiza claytonii), a sedge (Carex deweyana), and an invasive mint (Galeopsis tetrahit) were negatively correlated with exotic earthworm densities. Dtyopteris intermedia and Allium tricoccum, on the other hand, were associated with high earthworm densities. The activities of exotic earthworms appear to have significant impacts on Acer regeneration and the persistence of many herbaceous plants. Our findings suggest that the effects of exotic earthworms on litter mass are strongly related to the observed effects on species composition. Sensitive species can be used as indicators of high and low earthworm densities and might be useful for identifying forests of high conservation value where future invasions of exotic earthworms should be prevented.

J	vanDinter, M; Birks, HH				vanDinter, M; Birks, HH			Distinguishing fossil Betula nana and B-pubescens using their wingless fruits: Implications for the late-glacial vegetational history of western Norway	VEGETATION HISTORY AND ARCHAEOBOTANY												Principal components analysis of 7 size and shape variables measured on 454 modern fruit bodies of Betula species and hybrids shows that B. pubescens and B. nana can be distinguished from each other on the basis of their fruit bodies, and that B. pubescens ssp. tortuosa and hybrids either fall within the range of B. pubescens or have an intermediate position on PCA axes 1 and 2. Passive positioning on the modern PCB axes of fossil fruit bodies from late-glacial sediments at Eigebakken, south-west Norway, shows that only B. nana was locally present in the Allerod. This contradicts earlier inferences from pollen analyses alone of birch woodland development in the Allerod ire south-west Norway. There is no macrofossil evidence for tree-birches in the Allerod near Eigebakken. The relatively large amounts of Betula pollen, including B. pubescens, at Eigebakken are thus probably derived by long-distance transport from tree-birches in Denmark, south Sweden, and Britain, whose presence is proved there by macrofossils. Consequently, earlier estimates of mean July temperature during the Allerod in southwestern Norway should be reduced to around 7.5-10 degrees C. In contrast, the PCA shows that fruit bodies from Holocene sediments at Eigebakken and at Krakenes, western Norway, are mostly derived from B. pubescens. Birch trees were able to spread quickly and effectively across Norway in the early Holocene.

Of the 757 lakes censused, yellow-billed loons occupied 15% and Pacific loons (G. pacifica) 42%. Lake area, depth, proportion of shoreline in aquatic vegetation, shoreline complexity, hydrological connectivity (stream present within 100 m or absent), and an area-connectivity interaction were positive, significant predictors of yellow-billed loon presence in a multivariate logistic regression model, but distance to nearest river or Beaufort Sea coast were not. Predicted yellow-billed loon presence was 13 and 4.7 times more likely on deep and medium lakes, respectively, than on shallow lakes that freeze to the bottom. On small lakes (< 60 ha), predicted yellow-billed loon presence was 4.8-1.7 times more likely on lakes with hydrological connectivity than without, but connectivity was not important at most lake sizes (65-750 ha). Yellow-billed loon broods depend on fish available in the brood-rearing lake, and we suggest that a dependable supply of fish is more likely in larger lakes, those deep enough to have open water under winter ice, and those near streams. Highly convoluted shorelines and those with aquatic vegetation provide loon nesting and brood-rearing sites, as well as fish habitat. Pacific loon absence was a significant, positive predictor when added to the habitat model, indicating that yellow-billed loons were four times more likely on lakes without Pacific loons.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP	2006	567						227	236		10.1007/s10750-006-0042-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-006-0042-2													WOS:000239147500018

Differential habitat use patterns of yellow perch Perca flavescens in eastern Lake Michigan and connected drowned river mouth lakes	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Understanding stock structure and habitat use is important for sustainable fisheries management and conservation of genetic and phenotypic diversity. In eastern Lake Michigan, yellow perch Perca flavescens is found in both the nearshore region of Lake Michigan proper and drowned river mouth (DRM) lakes, small estuary-like systems directly connected to Lake Michigan. Recent genetic analyses suggest complex stock structure between these habitats and the potential migration of Lake Michigan yellow perch into the profundal zone of DRM lakes. We quantified carbon (delta C-13) and oxygen (delta O-18) stable isotope ratios of yellow perch otolith cores to index natal origins, and measured muscle delta C-13, nitrogen (delta N-15), delta O-18, and hydrogen (delta H-2) isotope ratios to reflect recent diet and habitat use. Stable isotope ratios of otolith cores and muscle samples support the existence of resident populations in nearshore Lake Michigan and DRM lakes, as well as Lake Michigan migrants using DRM lakes. Most fish caught in DRM lakes that had natal and recent stable isotope values similar to Lake Michigan fish were collected during fall in DRM lake profundal zones. Comparison of otolith core and muscle stable isotope ratios of individual yellow perch suggest that individuals that recently migrated to DRM lakes also spent early life in Lake Michigan. Differential habitat use patterns of yellow perch in eastern Lake Michigan may have important implications for harvest estimates and fishing regulations. Migration by Lake Michigan fish into DRM lakes does not appear to be related to reproduction, and the underlying benefits of these migrations remain unclear.

J	Omlin, M; Reichert, P; Forster, R				Omlin, M; Reichert, P; Forster, R			Biogeochemical model of Lake Zurich: model equations and results	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												A mathematical model for plankton, nutrient (phosphate, ammonia and nitrate) and oxygen dynamics in lakes was developed. It is based on horizontally averaged changes in substance and organism concentrations due to vertical mixing, sedimentation, in- and outflows and biogeochemical conversion processes in the water column and in adjacent sediment layers. The biological part of the model was kept as simple as possible with the three plankton classes Planktothrix Oscillatoria) rubescens (most abundant blue-green algae in the lake), other algae and zooplankton. Due to a strong phosphate limitation of algae growth in summer, the stoichiometry of primary production with respect to phosphorus had to be made variable in order to describe data sets available from Lake Zurich. In addition, a process of phosphate uptake of organic particles sinking through the hypolimnion had to be taken into account. After adjusting some model parameters, the model was able to reproduce the key features of the nutrient and oxygen profiles and of algae -zooplankton interactions over several years. However, it was not able to predict occasionally occurring blooms of specific types of algae. This shows that the model is a good tool for studying the dynamics of the key processes governing plankton and nutrient dynamics in the lake, but that it is not detailed enough for the investigation of rarely occurring phenomena involving specific types of algae and for an accurate representation of zooplankton dynamics.

J	Morgan, TKKB				Morgan, Te Kipa Kepa Brian			WAIORA AND CULTURAL IDENTITY Water quality assessment using the Mauri Model	ALTERNATIVE-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES												The New Zealand Government's Freshwater for a sustainable future (2004a) discussion paper raises the need for an effective process for the inclusion of Maori input on water management issues. Few processes have been developed specifically for Aotearoa/New Zealand. In Aotearoa/New Zealand, for Maori communities, a more appropriate level of resource management decision making is at the hapu (sub-tribe) level and it is here that input from Maori communities affected by proposals under the Resource Management Act must be considered. Hapu have direct relationships to puna (springs), other water bodies and a geographic region that are reinforced in their pepeha (tribal sayings) and whakataula (proverbs). Water bodies, such as streams, rivers, lakes and wetlands are key elements in the identity, whakapapa (genealogy) and mana (prestige) of the hapu. Water and all living things have their own mauri (life force or principle), which is important for a hapu to protect from degradation and damage. Therefore consultation and other forms of Maori involvement should incorporate representation of relevant hapu. Such a step would be consistent with the Treaty of Waitangi. Mauri is the central concept that the Mauri Model uses to interpret hapu values in the context of contemporary development. The Mauri Model has a strong foundation in the traditional values of tangata whenua (people of the land) and also parallels the current policy direction being taken by central government in New Zealand. This enables a direct comparison between the results of conventional engineering analysis and results based on analysis of impacts on mauri within the Mauri Model.																			1177-1801	1174-1740				JUN	2006	3	1					42	67		10.1177/117718010600300103	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/117718010600300103													WOS:000441434300003
J	Scherrer, SC; Appenzeller, C				Scherrer, Simon C.; Appenzeller, Christof			Fog and low stratus over the Swiss Plateau - a climatological study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												The occurrence of fog and low stratus (FLS) clouds is a common phenomenon over the Swiss plateau during the winter half years. Classical fog observations using horizontal visibility are of limited use for climatological analyses of persistent FLS situations. We present a simple method for determining long climatological series of days with FLS lasting at least a half or a full daylight day. The method relies solely on high quality relative sunshine duration measurements at two stations, a Plateau station below or within the FLS layer (e.g. Zurich/Fluntern) and a nearby peak station above the FLS layer (e.g. Santis). The analysis for the period 1901-2012 shows that full day FLS are a typical phenomenon of the months November to January, whereas the half day FLS also often occur in October and February. There is substantial interannual and decadal variability. The total number of Zurich full FLS days varies between 4 and 31d (mean: 17d) and between 10 and 49d (mean: 28d) for at least a half FLS days in the September to March period. The foggiest decade in the 1901-2012 record was 1984-1993; the least foggy decade was 1999-2008 with roughly 40-45% less FLS occurrence than only 15years before. In the most recent years a return towards the climatological mean can be observed. The long term data series does not show any significant long-term trends for the occurrence of full nor for half day FLS events. The reconstructed FLS occurrence is well correlated with the number of days with cold air pooling. They show very similar decadal variability and long term trends.

Managing a Destructive, Episodic Crop Disease: A National Survey of Wheat and Barley Growers' Experience With Fusarium Head Blight	PLANT DISEASE												The main techniques for minimizing Fusarium head blight (FHB, or scab) and deoxynivalenol in wheat and barley are well established and generally available: planting of moderately FHB-resistant cultivars, risk monitoring, and timely use of the most effective fungicides. Yet the adoption of these techniques remains uneven across the FHB-prone portions of the U.S. cereal production area. A national survey was undertaken by the U.S. Wheat and Barley Scab Initiative in 17 states where six market classes of wheat and barley are grown. In 2014, 5,107 usable responses were obtained. The highest percentages reporting losses attributable to FHB in the previous 5 years were in North Dakota, Maryland, Kentucky, and states bordering the Great Lakes but across all states, >= 75% of respondents reported no FHB-related losses in the previous 5 years. Adoption of cultivar resistance was uneven by state and market class and was low except among hard red spring wheat growers. In 13 states, a majority of respondents had not applied an FHB-targeted fungicide in the previous 5 years. Although the primary FHB information source varied by state, crop consultants were considered to be an important source or their primary source of information on risk or management of FHB by the largest percentage of respondents. Use of an FHB risk forecasting website was about twice as high in North Dakota as the 17-state average of 6%. The most frequently cited barriers to adopting FHB management practices were weather or logistics preventing timely fungicide application, difficulty in determining flowering timing for fungicide applications, and the impracticality of FHB-reducing rotations. The results highlight the challenges of managing an episodically damaging crop disease and point to specific areas for improvement.					; Bradley, Carl/LFU-8606-2024	Cowger, Christina/0000-0001-6950-2541; Bradley, Carl/0000-0002-8334-0750; Bergstrom, Gary/0000-0001-9613-270X; Boos, Dennis/0000-0002-8222-0095													0191-2917	1943-7692				MAR	2020	104	3					634	648		10.1094/PDIS-10-18-1803-SR	http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-10-18-1803-SR								31967505					WOS:000569160200005

Given the distinct differences in astronomical configurations and CO2 concentration between Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 11 and 13, here we investigate the role of astronomical forcing and CO2 on global vegetation changes during these two interglacials based on transient simulations performed with the model LOVECLIM1.3. Our results show that during these two interglacials, astronomical forcing plays a dominant role on the vegetation evolution, with the effect of CO2 being relatively small. The effect of astronomical forcing on vegetation can be explained successively by the relationship between climate (temperature, precipitation) and the astronomical parameters and by the relationship between vegetation and climate. The relative effect of precession and obliquity on vegetation strongly depends on regions and on interglacials. In general, obliquity plays a more important role on vegetation variations during MIS-11, while precession is more important during MIS-13. Our results also reveal a clear half-precession cycle (similar to 10 ka) in the variations of temperature, precipitation and vegetation in the tropical area during MIS-13, as a direct response to the tropical insolation. However, no obvious half-precession cycle is simulated during MIS-11 due to its weak precession variation but large obliquity variation, indicating that half-precession cycle is not stable in time.					; Su, Qianqian/I-3075-2018	Yin, Qiuzhen/0000-0002-7189-8335; LYU, ANQI/0000-0002-2026-5247; Wu, Zhipeng/0000-0002-4542-9949; 													0930-7575	1432-0894				JAN	2023	60	1-2					375	392		10.1007/s00382-022-06308-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-022-06308-y		MAY 2022											WOS:000799731800002
J	KALFF, J				KALFF, J			PHOSPHORUS LIMITATION IN SOME TROPICAL AFRICAN LAKES	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Two of 3 Kenyan lakes studied between Nov. 1979 and Oct. 1980 have very short 33PO4 turnover times, indicating a high P demand throughout the year. The P turnover time in Lakes Oloidien and Sonachi is as rapid as in the most P deficient temperate zone lakes. The 3rd lake, Lake Naivasha, has a lower overall P demand and a wide seasonal range, with lowest demand between Nov. 1979 and Feb. 1980 when a P deficiency was unlikely. On an annual basis the Lake Naivasha status is not statistically different from that recorded during the summer in Lake Memphremagog, a generally P-limited temperate zone lake. Lake Naivasha and Lake Oloidien fit well to the line of best fit for the Dillon-Rigler relationship relating total phosphorus (TP) and chlorophyll a derived in temperature zone lakes. Thus, temperate zone models predicting aspects of lake behavior on the basis of TP may also be applicable to these 2 tropical lakes. Saline lake Sonachi had not only a short P turnover time but also responded dramatically to the fertilization of enclosures with P. It does not fit the TP-chlorophyll a or the total N-chlorophyll a plots from the temperate zone. In this saline lake at least, much of the TP is unavailable to the algae, with some of it in a particulate form that is readily extracted with boiling water. The epilimnetic N:P ratios also characterize lakes Oloidien and Sonachi lakes as highly P deficient and lake Naivasha as more moderately P limited. A single set of measurements in Winam Gulf (Lake Victoria) also showed a rapid P turnover time and thus P limitation, but as in lake Sonachi much of the TP was in a non-algal particulate form. Occasional measurements in 3 other hypertrophic and saline lakes suggest them to be primarily light limited on the basis of their very high photosynthetic cover. The hypothesis of a primary P limitation for those lakes not light limited is supported and contradicts literature suggestions that N is the primary limiting element in tropical lakes.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1983	100						101	112		10.1007/BF00027425	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00027425													WOS:A1983RD01500006

A. kamchatica is an allotetraploid plant produced by the hybridization of two closely related diploid taxa, the Zn/Cd hyperaccumulator A. halleri and the non-accumulator A. lyrata. The heavy metal accumulation and vegetation ecology of A. k. ssp. kawasakiana were investigated by collecting leaves and rhizosphere soil samples in three natural habitats on the shore of Lake Biwa in Japan. Leaf Zn contents in almost all plants were above the level required by hyperaccumulators. Plants from one habitat preferred to grow on soils with topical high Zn levels, whereas rhizosphere soils from other populations contained basal levels of Zn suggesting that plant vegetation is more affected by soil disturbance and by soil Zn contents. A. k. ssp. kawasakiana plants were also found to be tolerant to Zn and Cd, in contrast to the nontolerant species A. thaliana. These findings indicated that A. k. ssp. kawasakiana is a facultative Zn hyperaccumulator, inheriting the trait from its parent A. halleri. Furthermore, A. k. ssp. kawasakiana is a self-compatible plant and Arabidopsis floral dip transformation might be applicable to this plant. Considering their natural diversity, A. k. ssp. kawasakiana will help the determination of the molecular mechanisms by which plants accumulate and tolerate heavy metals.

The last two glacial cycles in central Patagonia: A precise record from the Nirehuao glacier lobe	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Milankovitch orbital parameters control cycles of insolation, a primary pacer of long term changes in climate, but exactly how insolation signals are transmitted around the globe in the climate system is unclear. In order to address the fundamental questions of when and how ice age climates begin and end, how fast glaciers retreated during the last deglaciation, and how glaciers behaved before anthropogenic influence, we need robust glacial chronologies. The timing of local glacial maxima beyond the last glacial cycle, however, has remained largely unconstrained due to moraine degradation over time, limiting our ability to fully explore these questions. By developing a detailed geomorphic surficial map and targeting relatively tall, ridge-top boulders, we have constructed a new, precise 10Be chronology of glacial maxima of the Nirehuao glacier lobe (45 degrees S) for the last two glacial cycles. We report one of the first directly dated records of a MIS 6 glacier advance in Patagonia, which formed a major set of moraines by at least 153 +/- 5.1 ka, with a stillstand or smaller readvance by 137 +/- 4.2 ka, corresponding to the two coldest and dustiest periods of MIS 6 in Antarctica. The next largest advance occurred at 23.6 +/- 0.9 ka, at the end of peak Southern Hemisphere MIS 2 cooling. Retreat of the glacier commenced by similar to 18.5 cal ka BP when lakes in a tributary valley just to the southwest became ice-free. Overall we find that advances of the Nirehuao glacier lobe occur when winter sea ice around Antarctica is expansive and both obliquity and eccentricity are at their minima.

From May 2007 to April 2008, the algal composition, cell number and earthy-musty odorous compounds both in the water and in the flesh of fish at Sites A, B and C were determined monthly. The physicochemical parameters such as total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), dissolved oxygen ( DO), pH, transparency, water temperature and chlorophyll a (chl a) were simultaneously determined. A statistical correlation was noted between the chl a and water temperature: 0.678 (P < 0.05) for Site A, 0.831 (P < 0.01) for Site B and 0.659 ( P, 0.05) for Site C. Geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB)-in the reservoir were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). We observed that a large amount of Anabaena circinalis bloomed in surface water during the off-flavour episodes. In July 2007, we detected the highest concentration of geosmin (2.7 mu g/L in the water, 0.27 mu g/kg in the silver carp and 0.10 mu g/kg in the crucian carp), while no 2-MIB was detected, which indicated that geosmin was mainly responsible for the off-flavour episodes in summer.					zhang, ting/IYT-0642-2023														0003-7214						2010	59	4					243	254		10.2166/aqua.2010.019	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/aqua.2010.019													WOS:000278102800004

Winter Star. Wastes were evaluated in a Patagonian soil (Andic cryofluvent) and a granitic soil (Ultic Palexeralf). The treatments were municipal sewage sludge (MSS) salmon ground-farming waste (PSW) and salmon lake-farming waste (LSW) at different rates: 25, 50, 75, 100 and 150 t ha(-1). Bioassays in lettuce were conducted for germination Index (GI), radicle and hypocotyl structure length. Test in ryegrass were conducted for aboveground biomass yield. The phytotoxicological results from Patagonian soil showed significant differences (P <= 0.05) among sludge, where the highest values for GI, radicle and hypocotyl length were for LSW, followed by PSW. Results from granitic soil showed no significant differences among sludge added. In both soils, MSS treatment at application rate of 150 t ha(-1) presented the smallest radicle length, not showing development of the hypocotyl structure. Biomass data indicated that MSS, PSW and LSW sludge can be applied at 25 to 150 t ha(-1) on Patagonian soil and only LSW sludge oil granitic soil. However, its addition should be complemented with N and K inorganic fertilizer to increase pasture yield. MSS and PSW sludge applied at 150 t ha(-1) was clearly detrimental for crop yield. especially when applied to granitic soil.

This region of China is unique as it contains large temperature gradients, from the subtropics to the foothills of the Himalaya, but also contains lakes that have been heavily impacted by anthropogenic activities. The chironomid communities were dominated by 8 taxa, which together accounted for 77.7 % of the fauna. The statistical analyses indicated that mean July air temperature and water depth were the most significant variables affecting the distribution of chironomids across these sites. After removing 3 major outliers from axis 1 in the ordination data set, temperature lost its significance but water depth and reductions in bottom dissolved oxygen (DO) were still found to be significant. In addition the diversity of the dataset was found to be low compared with other chironomid training sets throughout the world, suggesting that this region in China has different characteristics governing the abundance and distribution of chironomids compared with other parts of the world, hence the need for regional training sets within China. This is the first subfossil chironomid data set from this region and the understanding of key environmental influences on contemporary faunas will aid interpretations of palaeolimnological data sets to reconstruct past trends and magnitude of environmental change over a range of timescales.

Our results show a comparable C-4-plant contribution between the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the Holocene. An increase of the C-4-plant contribution by 15-20% is found for Terminations IV, II and I relative to subsequent interglacial peaks, coeval with an expansion of Cyperaceae and Poaceae. In contrast, Termination V reveals a lower C-4-plant contribution than Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 11c. The data exhibit a long-term trend, with a stepwise increase of the C-4-plant contribution across interglacials MIS 11c, 9e, 7e and 1. We suggest that no substantial changes in humidity levels over glacial-interglacial cycles occurred facilitating a similar C-3/C-4-plant ratio for the LGM and the Holocene. Instead, deglacial sea-level rises caused an extensive development of floodplains and wetlands on the exposed continental shelf, providing habitats for the spread of C-4 sedges and grasses. The progressive subsidence of Chinese coastal areas and the broadening of the continental shelf over the late Quaternary explains the nearly absence of C-4 plant occurrence during Termination V and a gradual increase of the C-4-plant contribution across interglacial peaks. Taken together, changes in coastal environments should be considered when interpreting marine-based vegetation reconstructions from subtropical Asia. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Solar Radiation as the Likely Cause of Acid-Soluble Rare-Earth Elements in Sediments of Fresh Water Humic Lakes	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												We studied photochemically induced precipitation of rare-earth elements (REEs) in water from a tributary to Plegne Lake and a tributary to Jiricka Pond, Czech Republic. Both tributaries had high concentrations of dissolved organic matter (similar to 1.8 mmol C L-1). Filtered (0.2 mu m) samples were exposed to artificial solar radiation of 350 W m(-2) for 48 to 96 h, corresponding to 3 to 6 days of natural solar radiation in summer at the sampling locations. Experiments were performed with altered and unaltered pH ranging from 3.8 to 6.0. The formation of particulate REEs occurred in all exposed samples with the fastest formation observed at the original pH. The formation of particulate metals continued in irradiated samples after the end of irradiation, suggesting that photochemically induced reactions and/or continuing precipitation continue in darkness or in deeper water due to mixing. Results were compared with paleolimnological records in the Plesne Lake sediment. At pH 5.0, the photochemically induced sediment flux was 3509 nmol m(-2) y(-1) for Ce, corresponding to 42% of the REEs' annual sediment flux in recent sediment layers. Combining the formation rates obtained in the laboratory irradiation experiments and known 1 day incident solar radiation enabled the estimation of a possible REE sediment flux. For Plesne Lake, the photochemically induced formation of particulate REEs explained 10-44% of the REE concentrations in the upper sediment layers. Observed photochemically induced sequestration of REEs into sediments can explain a significant part of the REEs' history in the Holocene sediment.					; Kopacek, Jiri/A-7373-2014; Porcal, Petr/A-7350-2014	Kopacek, Jiri/0000-0002-4409-4032; Porcal, Petr/0000-0002-7787-4924													0013-936X	1520-5851				FEB 4	2020	54	3					1545	1553		10.1021/acs.est.9b05146	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.9b05146								31909597					WOS:000511508500028

We report on trends in population size and reproduction of Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) at Besnard Lake, Saskatchewan, Canada, during 1968-2012. We investigated the relative importance of density-dependent (population size) and density-independent (climate) factors in explaining variation in population growth rate and productivity. The number of occupied Bald Eagle territories increased until ca. 1988, but remained stable afterwards, fluctuating around ca. 26 pairs. The number of successful pairs increased until only ca. 1977 and remained relatively stable or slightly declined afterwards (ca. 16 successful breeding pairs per year). We found a strong negative density-dependence in all reproduction parameters (mean productivity, nesting success, mean brood size at fledging). Annual production initially increased in the 1970s, but decreased afterwards, while nesting success decreased throughout the whole study period. We also found a strong density-dependence in population growth rate, indicating that the stabilized population was regulated. It probably reached its carrying capacity in the late 1970s, although population size continued to increase until the late 1980s. Mean brood size at fledging was negatively related to the number of failed nesting pairs. Density alone explained most of the variation in breeding performance, although milder springs were weakly associated with a higher nesting success. Finally, we found evidence for regular fluctuations in mean productivity, and particularly in nesting success, with a 5-yr period. We discuss possible mechanisms behind the observed patterns of density-dependent reproduction and implications for our knowledge of how this eagle population is regulated.

Photosynthesis of the organism was studied using oxygen evolution and variable fluorescence. After transfer to 2 in depth in the epilimnion. simulating an entrainment event that normally occurs in late summer, photoacclimation was followed. The metalimnetic population had a very high photosynthetic efficiency, and the minimum quantum requirement varied between 7-12 photons (mol O-2)(-1). Upon transfer to high light the quantum requirement increased, which was interpreted as inactivation of a number of photosystem II (PSII) units. At the first entrainment we observed only inactivation of PSII, causing a decrease in the slope of the photosynthesis light curve (both for oxygen evolution and photosynthetic electron transport by PSII (ETR)), without affecting the maximal rate of oxygen evolution (PBmaxB), suggesting no effect on CO2-fixation. During the 2(nd) entrainment experiment we observed both an inactivation of the number of PSII as well as a decrease in P-max(B). In both cases the ETR-based estimates of oxygen evolution (P-B) overestimated the measured rate of P-B, indicating the operation of alternative electron sinks. Especially at high light respiratory processes were seemingly stimulated.

J	DICKMAN, M; FORTESCUE, J				DICKMAN, M; FORTESCUE, J			THE ROLE OF LAKE DEACIDIFICATION AS INFERRED FROM SEDIMENT CORE DIATOM STRATIGRAPHIES	AMBIO												Closely determined (2 mm intervals) diatom stratigraphy coupled with lead-210 estimated sedimentation rates indicated that recent changes in the relative abundance of diatom pH indicator assemblages provided evidence of lake deacidification in Sudbury and Algoma area lakes. This is the first report of evidence for lake deacidification occurring in the Algoma Region. One hundred and fifty lakes north of Sudbury, Ontario were cored during the summer of 1986. The cores from 2 of these lakes were selected for sectioning on the basis of their apparent lack of bioturbation. The 2-mm thick sections from the shallower of these two lakes (Lake 29B) revealed a significant (P < 0.05) upcore increase in diatom-inferred pH from 4.3 (c. 1983) to 5.0 in 1986. This reduction in acidity was attributed to the reduction in SO2 loadings in the region around Sudbury, following the closure of the Coniston smelter in 1972, the construction of the 381-m high superstack by Inco in 1972 and the government regulated reductions in SO2 loadings. A similar study of 150 lakes in the Algoma District north of Lake Superior indicated that there was also evidence of deacidification in one of two lakes located downwind of iron smelters of Sault Ste. Marie.																			0044-7447					MAY	1991	20	3-4					129	135																WOS:A1991FR88100008

In this paper, we describe a lightweight, compact and autonomous 24 GHz frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar system for freshwater ice thickness and snow mass (snow water equivalent, SWE) measurements. Although FMCW radars have a long-established history, the novelty of this research lies in that we take advantage the availability of a new generation of low cost and low power requirement units that facilitates the monitoring of snow and ice at remote locations. Test performance (accuracy and limitations) is presented for five different applications, all using an automatic operating mode with improved signal processing: (1) In situ lake ice thickness measurements giving 2 cm accuracy up to approximate to 1 m ice thickness and a radar resolution of 4 cm; (2) remotely piloted aircraft-based lake ice thickness from low-altitude flight at 5 m; (3) in situ dry SWE measurements based on known snow depth, giving 13% accuracy (RMSE 20%) over boreal forest, subarctic taiga and Arctic tundra, with a measurement capability of up to 3 m in snowpack thickness; (4) continuous monitoring of surface snow density under particular Antarctic conditions; (5) continuous SWE monitoring through the winter with a synchronized and collocated snow depth sensor (ultrasonic or LiDAR sensor), giving 13.5% bias and 25 mm root mean square difference (RMSD) (10%) for dry snow. The need for detection processing for wet snow, which strongly absorbs radar signals, is discussed. An appendix provides 24 GHz simulated effective refractive index and penetration depth as a function of a wide range of density, temperature and wetness for ice and snow.

The study involved 30 individuals of fish caught in spring. The muscles samples for analyses were taken from the large side muscle of the fish body above the lateral line. Calcium concentration was determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometer Solar 969, Unicam. Phosphorus content was analyzed with colorimetric method, by spectrophotometer Lambda 25, Perkin-Elmer (at wavelength 430 nm). The mean content of Ca in the meat of fish caught from Lake Goreckie, Strzeszynskie and Wedromierz was 3.175, 0,516 and 2.498 g kg(-1), respectively. The significantly higher amounts of Ca were determined in the gills than in the meat and liver and ranged from 63.09 g kg(-1) (the Lake Goreckie) to 70.24 g kg(-1) (the Lake Strzeszynskie). The mean content of P was at the same level in the meat and in the liver and ranged from 2.703 g.kg(-1) to 2.812 g k(g-)1. Ratio of calcium to phosphorus in the meat of fish caught from the lake Goreckie, Wedromierz and Strzeszynskie was 1.174:1, 0.254:1 and 0,888:1, respectively.

Fuji over the past 8000 years based on integrated records of lacustrine and terrestrial tephra sequences and radiocarbon dating	QUATERNARY SCIENCE ADVANCES												Reliable records of past volcanic activities are essential for assessing future eruption probabilities and establishing effective volcanic disaster mitigation plans. We integrated the lacustrine and terrestrial sequences of tephra deposits at the northeastern foot of Mt. Fuji based on high-resolution radiocarbon (14C) dating to elucidate its eruptive history over the past 8000 years. Accurate chronologies of 29 tephra layers in the Lake Yamanaka sediments (core YA-1) were determined using the age-depth model of the 14C of bulk organic matter after variability correction of lake reservoir ages. The following ages were compared to those of major tephra deposits in the proximal trench section (MF20-01) and in the literature. From -7300 to -3200 cal yr BP, four tephra layers in core YA-1 (i.e., YA-T1, 2, 7, and 10) were likely correlated with the scoria fall deposits S-3, 5, 6, and 10 respectively, as reported in the outcrops near the lake. The core also features six undetected eruptions from -5050 to -3900 cal yr BP, demonstrating the advantages of lake sediments proximal to the volcano in identifying previously undetected eruptions. After -3200 cal yr BP, five tephra layers in core YA-1, ranging from -2900 to -1600 cal yr BP (YA-T11, 12, 14, 20, and 22), showed similar age ranges as the major tephra layers in MF20-01 (IY5, 8, 11, 25, and 26), with identical lithological characteristics and stratigraphic orders. This suggests that the tephra sequence in the trench section positively reflects the major eruptive events over the past 2900 years, providing a basis for the comprehensive reconstruction of volcanic eruption histories in the region.					; Yokoyama, Yusuke/N-9623-2013; Yamamoto, Shinya/C-5134-2011	Yamamoto, Shinya/0000-0001-7938-1106; 													2666-0334					OCT	2023	12								100091	10.1016/j.qsa.2023.100091	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.qsa.2023.100091		OCT 2023											WOS:001098774400001

A Satellite-Based Summer Convective Cloud Frequency Analysis over the Southeastern United States	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												A convective cloud (CC) analysis is performed over the southeastern United States (SEUS) during June, July, and August 2006 and 2007, using data from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) visible and infrared sensors as processed by a satellite-based convection cloud mask and initiation algorithm. Six 5-7-day periods are analyzed between the times 1500 and 1900 UTC, representative of summertime conditions in the SEUS. The; similar to 8.7 x 10(8) pixel database contains information on nonprecipitating CCs possessing various satellite-estimated attributes of cloud size, based on whether they meet set thresholds in eight infrared "interest fields." CCs at similar to 1 km x 1 km pixel size in the GOES projection are evaluated in comparison with the land cover classes, elevation gradients, and normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVIs) beneath the CCs. The goals are to relate the frequency of occurrence of CCs to land surface properties, attempting to determine which of these three properties are most correlated with CCs. CCs are more likely to form over forests and dense vegetation and over higher gradients in elevation. Although forest cover classes are not the most common over the SEUS, CC occurrence increases disproportionately where steeply sloped topography and forests are coincident across large regions of the SEUS. Also, as NDVI increases, the percentage of CCs per land class also increases. Analysis of landscape heterogeneity (combining local variability in land classes, topography, and NDVI) shows that as it increases CC development is more widespread. Thus, lakes among forests and hilly topography intermingled with agricultural lands appear most conducive to high CC frequency.

Understanding the hydrologic significance of the regional litho-stratigraphy and structures help to better understand the hydrodynamics. This work is aimed at characterizing the Baro-Akobo-Sobbat sub-basin of Nile and determine trans-basin flows. Integrated method is used to characterize the basin and determine the Baro-Akobo-Sobbat sub-basin's relationship with African Mesozoic Rifts. Oil and water well drilling logs; aeromagnetic, gravity and vertical electrical sounding data; and various study reports are used to establish regional lithostrati-graphic correlations and determine trans-regional hydrogeological connectivity. A total of 633 samples collected from wells, springs, rivers, lakes, swamps and rain water are analysed for their chemical, stable isotopes, tritium and radon properties. The Baro-Akobo river basin is commonly presumed to have good groundwater potential, particularly in its lowland plain. However, it has poor exploitable groundwater potential and recharge rate due to the extensive clay cover, limited retention capacity and the loss of the bulk of the groundwaters through regional geological structures to the deep seated continental sediments; presumably reaching the hydraulically connected African Mesozoic Rifts; mainly Melut and Muglad. The deep underground northward flows, along Nile River is, presumably, retarded by Central African Shear Zone in the Sudan. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A total of 2,504 fish were sampled using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), which distinguished 17 alleles in coho salmon and 20 alleles in chinook salmon. Heterozygosity at the AI locus was moderately high for both coho (0.7) and chinook (0.6) salmon, but sequence divergence was low, with mean inter-and intraspecific nucleotide similarities of approximately 0.96. In a maximum parsimony tree, all of the observed alleles clustered into two trans-specific lineages. Within each lineage, coho and chinook alleles tended to fall into species-specific subclusters. Much of the intraspecific allelic variation within each lineage could be accounted for by nonsynonymous point mutation, indicative of balancing selection. The F-ST values for both coho (0.11) and chinook (0.13) salmon indicated that much of the allelic diversify was partitioned among populations. Neighbor-joining analyses of Al allelic frequencies among coho and chinook salmon populations showed strong patterns of geographic differentiation similar to those based on neutral genetic markers such as microsatellite loci. Both natural selection and the salmonid zoogeographic history of frequent population bottlenecks have shaped the patterns of diversity observed al this and other Mhc exons in Pacific salmonids.																			0018-0661						1997	127	1-2					83	95		10.1111/j.1601-5223.1997.00083.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1601-5223.1997.00083.x								9420474					WOS:000071313300013

After accounting for variation in total phosphorus (TP) concentrations, lakes with Dreissena had lower total phytoplankton biomass, as measured by chlorophyll a and algal cell biovolume. Phytoplankton biomass increased with TP in both sets of lakes, although the elevations of the relationship differed. The percentage of the total phytoplankton comprised by cyanobacteria increased with TP in lakes without Dreissena (R-2 = 0.21, P = 0.025) but not in lakes with Dreissena (P = 0.79). Surprisingly, there was a positive influence of Dreissena invasion on Microcystis dominance in lakes with TP < 25 mug L-1 (P = 0.0018) but not in lakes with TP > 25 mug L-1 (P = 0.86). The finding that Microcystis, a relatively grazing-resistant component of the phytoplankton, was favored by Dreissena in low- but not in high-nutrient lakes is somewhat counterintuitive, but predator-prey models make this prediction in certain cases when the cost for the prey of being consumption resistant is a low maximum population growth rate. This Dreissena-cyanobacteria interaction contradicts well-established patterns of increasing cyanobacteria with nutrient enrichment in north-temperate lakes and suggests that the monitoring and abatement of nutrient inputs to lakes may not be sufficient to predict and control cyanobacterial dominance of Dreissena-invaded lakes.					; Hamilton, Stephen/N-2979-2014	Wilson, Alan/0000-0003-1080-0354; Hamilton, Stephen/0000-0002-4702-9017													0024-3590	1939-5590				MAR	2004	49	2					482	487		10.4319/lo.2004.49.2.0482	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2004.49.2.0482													WOS:000224979500016

France) stand at Shawnigan Lake were studied over 18 years. At years 0, 9, and 18 after treatments, the aboveground biomass and N, P, K, Ca, and Mg contents of stemwood, stem bark, foliage, and dead and live branches were determined (kg/ha), and increments in these properties (kg ha(-1)-year(-1)) were calculated for the 0-9 and 9-18 year periods. Foliar biomass was increased by both treatments during the first period and also by thinning in the second period. Aboveground net primary production (ANPP) per unit of foliage biomass (foliage efficiency) was increased by treatments in the 0-9 year period. The combined effects of increased foliage mass and foliage efficiency resulted in increased total biomass production. Thinning and fertilization increased the uptake of all elements except for P with fertilization. This increase may have contributed to the long-term increase in stem growth. Retranslocation of elements before foliage shedding was important for tree nutrition, but was not improved by fertilization during the 9-18 year measurement period. The efficiency of N use in dry matter production (ANPP/unit of N uptake) was decreased by fertilization. This implied that poor sites would respond better to fertilization than rich sites.

J	Stanford, SD				Stanford, Scott D.			Onshore record of Hudson River drainage to the continental shelf from the late Miocene through the late Wisconsinan deglaciation, USA: synthesis and revision	BOREAS												Fluvial and glacial deposits in New Jersey, Long Island, and the Hudson valley provide a record of Hudson River drainage since the late Miocene. Late Miocene fluvial deposits record southerly flow across the emerged inner New Jersey shelf. In the late Miocene-early Pliocene this drainage incised, shifted southwesterly, and discharged to the shelf south of New Jersey. During late Pliocene or Early Pleistocene glaciation, discharge to the shelf in the New York City area was established. This drainage incised and stabilized in the Early and Middle Pleistocene and remained open during pre-Wisconsinan (Oxygen Isotope Stage 6? (OIS-6?)) and late Wisconsinan (OIS-2) glacial advances. During late Wisconsinan retreat, moraine deposits dammed the valley at the Narrows to form Lake Albany. From 19 to 15.5 kyr BP (all dates in 14C yr), Hudson drainage was directed eastward into the Long Island Sound lowland. Drainage of Lake Wallkill into Lake Albany at 15.5 kyr BP breached the Narrows dam and initiated the unstable phase of Lake Albany, which was controlled by eroding spillways, first on the moraine dam, then on emerged lake-bottom in the mid-Hudson valley. Marine incursion between 12 and 11 kyr BP limited fluvial incision of the lake bottom, stabilizing the Quaker Springs, Coveville, and upper Fort Ann spillways. Lowering sea level between 11 and 10 kyr BP allowed incision from the upper to lower Fort Ann threshold. Sediment eroded by lake outflows between 15 and 10.5 kyr BP was trapped in the glacially deepened lower valley. Little inland sediment reached the shelf after 20 kyr BP.

Spatial variation in soil active-layer geochemistry across hydrologic margins in polar desert ecosystems	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Polar deserts are characterized by severe spatial-temporal limitations of liquid water. In soil active layers of the Antarctic Dry Valleys, liquid water is infrequently available over most of the arid terrestrial landscape. However, soils on the margins of glacial melt-water streams and lakes are visibly wet during the brief Austral summer when temperatures permit the existence of liquid water. We examined the role of these hydrologic margins as preferential zones for the transformation and transport of nutrient elements and solutes in an environment where geochemical weathering and biological activity is strictly limited by the dearth of liquid water. We report on hydropedological investigations of aquatic-terrestrial transition zones adjacent to 11 stream and lake systems in the Antarctic Dry Valleys. Our results show that wetted zones extended 1-11 m from the edges of lotic and lentic systems. While capillary demand and surface evaporation drive a one-way flux of water through these zones, the scale of these transition zones is determined by the topography and physical characteristics of the surrounding soils. Nutrient concentrations and fluxes appear to be influenced by both the hydrology and microbial-mediated biogeochemical processes. Salt concentrations are enriched near the distal boundary of the wetted fronts due to evapo-concentration of pore water in lake margin soils, while organic matter, ammonium and phosphate concentrations are highest in stream channel sediments where potential for biological activity is greatest. Thus, in the Antarctic Dry Valleys, intermittently wet soils on the margins of streams and lakes are important zones of both geochemical cycling and biological activity.

J	Flood, B; Wells, M; Dunlop, E; Young, J				Flood, Bryan; Wells, Mathew; Dunlop, Erin; Young, Joelle			Vertical oscillations of the thermocline caused by internal waves modify coldwater pelagic fish distribution: Results from a large stratified lake	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Fishes typically occupy a species-specific temperature range, with their occupied depth being related to the lake's temperature profile. When a fish's preferred temperature range coincides with the thermocline, the location of their preferred thermal habitat is influenced by the rise and fall of internal waves, leading to possible changes in fish depth. These internal waves are common in large, stratified lakes, yet we do not know how they affect the spatial distribution and behavior of freshwater fishes. We conducted nighttime hydroacoustic surveys in a large, deep embayment of a large thermally stratified lake to observe whether pelagic fish respond to vertical oscillations of the thermocline caused by internal waves. The coldwater pelagic fish in our study (primarily cisco, Coregonus artedi) typically occupied a narrow vertical band approximately 5-8 m thick and temperatures between 10.8 +/- 0.8-13.6 +/- 1.6 degrees C (fishes sized 106- 500 mm), just below the thermocline (centered around 15-17 degrees C). Importantly, the upper bound of fish depth varied in response to vertical thermocline movements associated with internal waves, suggesting fish respond to changes in their physical environment on timescales commensurate with basin-scale internal wave periods (hours to days), to remain within their preferred thermal habitat. Dissolvedoxygen levels were typically above avoidance thresholds of these fish, thus not likely exerting a strong influence on fish location. Our findings emphasize the need to account for internal waves when designing hydroacoustic and netting surveys, as thermocline movements can influence where fish are located.

J	Lowe, WH; Bolger, DT				Lowe, WH; Bolger, DT			Local and landscape-scale predictors of salamander abundance in New Hampshire headwater streams	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												We investigated the response of Gyrinophilus porphyriticus (Plethodontidae), the spring salamander, to timber harvest in headwater streams in New Hampshire (U.S.A.). We conducted cover-controlled, whole-stream surveys for G. porphyriticus in 25 first-order streams in drainages encompassing a range of timber-harvest histories. Streams in two different landscape configurations were chosen, isolated, or paired, based on the presence or absence of a confluent first-order stream-a potential source of immigrants. The analyzed salamander abundance with respect to logging history, presence of the brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), salamander population connectivity, and other measures of physical habitat and aquatic conditions. In stepwise multiple-regression analysis, the best multivariate model of G. porphyriticus abundance included fish presence/absence; effect category, a combined junction of years since harvest and substrate embeddedness by fine sediment; and landscape configuration. These three factors explained 74% of the variation in G. porphyriticus abundance. G. porphyriticus was less abundant in streams where fish were present, likely because of predation by S. fontinalis or asymmetric competition between these species. Abundance also declined with increasing substrate embeddedness and/or decreasing years since harvest, indicating an effect of fine sediment inputs and harvest history on this species. Finally, G. porphyriticus was less abundant in isolated streams than in paired streams, This result suggests that landscape-scale population connectivity may buffer this species from the negative effects of local (i.e., stream-scale) habitat perturbation. We hope this work will encourage others to develop multiscale models of land-use effects on stream biota and thereby ultimately increase the range and effectiveness of conservation strategies for these species.																			0888-8892					FEB	2002	16	1					183	193		10.1046/j.1523-1739.2002.00360.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1523-1739.2002.00360.x								35701965					WOS:000173726400018

Thomas			Distribution and Prevalence of Glochidia-Infested Wild-Caught Fishes at a Muskingum River Site in Southeastern Ohio	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Wild-caught fishes were examined from the Muskingum River in southeastern Ohio for the prevalence of glochidial infestation. Weekly collections over a 24-hour period for one year yielded 22 fish species (2,097 individuals). Six species (27%) were infested with glochidia - channel catfish, freshwater drum, gizzard shad, orange-spotted sunfish, bluegill, and hybrid Morone. Infestations were found during the months of March through August, and no infested fish were found during the months of September through February. The month with the highest number of infested fish species was August, and the lowest number occurred in April. The percentage of all individuals infested with glochidia was very low, 2.5%, but was similar to that reported for other rivers and higher than that reported for most lakes. The percentage of all fish species infested was lower than those reported for rivers but still greater than the results for takes. The impounded study site seems to fall between a unregulated river and a lake in terms of its prevalence of infested fishes. The glochidia were over-dispersed in the host populations; 100% of the infested species had 50% or fewer of their individuals infested. The mussel faunal assemblage at the study site appeared to be driven primarily by the presence of a single fish, freshwater drum, and not by the relative abundance of the fish species available.																			0270-5060					MAR	2010	25	1					119	126		10.1080/02705060.2010.9664364	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2010.9664364													WOS:000275293500014
J	Manning, AH; Solomon, DK				Manning, AH; Solomon, DK			Using noble gases to investigate mountain-front recharge	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Mountain-front recharge is a major component of recharge to inter-mountain basin-fill aquifers. The two components of mountain-front recharge are (1) subsurface inflow from the mountain block (subsurface inflow), and (2) infiltration from perennial and ephemeral streams near the mountain front (stream seepage). The magnitude of subsurface inflow is of central importance in source protection planning for basin-fill aquifers and in some water rights disputes, yet existing estimates carry large uncertainties. Stable isotope ratios can indicate the magnitude of mountain-front recharge relative to other components, but are generally incapable of distinguishing subsurface inflow from stream seepage. Noble gases provide an effective tool for determining the relative significance of subsurface inflow, specifically. Dissolved noble gas concentrations allow for the determination of recharge temperature, which is correlated with recharge elevation. The nature of this correlation cannot be assumed, however, and must be derived for the study area. The method is applied to the Salt Lake Valley Principal Aquifer in northern Utah to demonstrate its utility. Samples from 16 springs and mine tunnels in the adjacent Wasatch Mountains indicate that recharge temperature decreases with elevation at about the same rate as the mean annual air temperature, but is on average about 2 T cooler. Samples from 27 valley production wells yield recharge elevations ranging from the valley elevation (about 1500 m) to mid-mountain elevation (about 2500 m). Only six of the wells have recharge elevations less than 1800 m. Recharge elevations consistently greater than 2000 m in the southeastern part of the basin indicate that subsurface inflow constitutes most of the total recharge in this area.

These events are primarily caused by the transport Of Pollutants from urban areas in Massachusetts and farther south and west. Pollutant transport is most efficient over the ocean. The coastline makes transport processes complex because it makes the Structure of the atmospheric boundary layer complex. During pollution episodes, the air over land in daytime is warmer than the sea surface, so air transported from land over water becomes statically stable and the formerly well-mixed boundary layer separates into possibly several layers, each transported in a different direction. This study examines several of the atmospheric boundary layer processes involved in pollutant transport. A three-dimensional model [the Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Mesoscalc Prediction System (COAMPS)] run oil grids of 2.5 and 7.5 km is used to examine the winds, thermodynamic structure, and structure of tracer plumes emitted from Boston, Massachusetts, and New York City, New York, in two different real cases - one dominated by large-scale transport (22-23 July 2002) and one with important mesoscale effects (11-14 August 2002). The model simulations are compared with measurements taken during the 2002 New England Air Quality Study. The model simulates the basic Structure of the two different episodes well. The boundary layer stability over the cold water is weaker in the model than in reality. The tracer allows for easy visualization of the pollutant transport.

These species (Acorus calamus L., Carer acuta L., Equisetum fluviatile L., Sagittaria sagittifolia L., Scirpus lacustris L., Sparganium erectum L., Typha angustifolia L. and Typha latifolia L.) showed distributional differences, which could be related to the hydrological regime and to the redox potential and organic matter content of the submerged sediment in the littoral of floodplain lakes. The growth responses of these helophyte species were studied in relation to flooding ( plants partially flooded versus totally submerged) and sediment characteristics (mineral, moderately reductive sediment versus organic, highly reductive sediment) for 8 weeks during the growth season in outdoor artificial ponds under ambient climatic conditions. Flooding conditions were found to exert a clear impact on helophyte growth responses. In response to total submergence, most species showed shoot length extensions and restored contact between leaves and air. Shoot fractions were generally lower under submerged conditions, as a result of growth reduction at prolonged submergence. The impact of sediment characteristics on growth responses of the species under study depended partly on the flooding conditions. All species under study tolerated prolonged anoxic and toxic sediments, provided the plants grow emergent. When growing emergent on organic, highly reductive sediments, these species increased their growth rate and allocated biomass to above-ground plant parts, which suggests a general adaptation mechanism to hypoxic and toxic conditions. Prolonged submergence on organic, highly reductive substrates resulted in a growth reduction of all species selected. Our results indicate that the decline of the helophyte vegetation in moderately dynamic floodplain lakes along the Lower Rhine and Meuse can be related to the combination of the organic, highly reductive sediments and the increased incidence of summer floods there in particular. Besides shared growth responses, species-specific differences in flooding tolerance and field distribution were observed between the selected helophyte species. The experimentally established flooding tolerances and tolerances to highly reductive substrates were generally larger than predicted by the observations on the distribution of the species in the field, suggesting that additional factors which restrict the occurrence of these species are involved.					van der Velde, Gerard/C-7776-2011														0304-3770					APR	1995	50	1					79	97		10.1016/0304-3770(95)00452-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(95)00452-6													WOS:A1995RC76300007

To utilize the fish resources in contaminated lakes, the present work presents for the first time the effectiveness of using clean feed to counteract contamination of radionuclides in fish. The study is based on a series of repeated experiments with Prussian carp (Carassius gibelio (Bloch, 1782)) kept in cages in the contaminated Glubokoye Lake during summer 2018-2021. By the addition of clean feed, the activity concentration of 137Cs in fish muscle tissues was lowered with a factor of 2-5 due to biodilution. Surprisingly, additional clean feed did not lead to further decrease in the uptake of 137Cs in fish. In contrast to 137Cs, the addition of clean feed increased the 90Sr activity concentration in fish by a factor of 2-4 compared to fish fed with naturally occurring feed items. Radioactive strontium accumulated mainly in the fish bones and the muscle tissue level was 2 orders of magnitude lower, similar to the distribution observed for stable Sr. By utilizing a new kinetic model describing the dynamics of strontium isotopes in bone tissues of fish, predictions fitted well with site-specific data, taking growth rates and aging into account. Results showed that clean feeding can be used to counteract high activity concentration of 137Cs in fish due to biodilution, but cannot counteract bioaccumulation of 90Sr. Findings highlighted that it is essential to understand underlying factors influencing the uptake pathways for contaminants, as access to clean feed could increase the growth and thereby reduce the body activity concentration of dietary associated radionuclides such as 137Cs (biodilution), as well as increase the transfer of dissolved compounds such as 90Sr directly from water to fish.

Sedimentary biogeochemical records can provide a unique means to understand the nature of these changes over long time scales, where observational data fall short. We deployed in situ experiments on two shallow subarctic lakes with contrasting light regimes; a clear tundra lake and a dark woodland lake, to first investigate the photochemical transformation of carbon and nitrogen elemental (C/N ratio) and isotope (delta C-13, delta N-15) composition in lake water particulate organic matter (POM) for downcore inferences. We then explored elemental, isotopic, and spectral (inferred lake water total organic carbon [TOC] and sediment chlorophyll a [CHLa]) fingerprints in the lake sediments to trace changes in aquatic production, terrestrial inputs and photodegradation before and after profound human impacts on the global carbon cycle prompted by industrialization. POM pool in both lakes displayed tentative evidence of UV photoreactivity, reflected as increasing delta C-13 and decreasing C/N values. Through time, the tundra lake sediments traced subtle shifts in primary production, while the woodland lake carried signals of changing terrestrial contributions, indicating shifts in terrestrial carbon export but possibly also photodegradation rates. Under global human impact, both lakes irrespective of their distinct carbon regimes displayed evidence of increased productivity but no conspicuous signs of increased terrestrial influence. Overall, sediment biogeochemistry can integrate a wealth of information on carbon regulation in northern lakes, while our results also point to the importance of considering the entire spectrum of photobiogeochemical fingerprints in sedimentary studies.					; Meyer-Jacob, Carsten/B-8248-2014; Smol, John/A-8838-2015; Rantala, Marttiina/GWV-8049-2022	Kivila, E.

The two Ukinrek Maars in south-western Alaska erupted between 30 March and 9 April 1977 and are the best-documented maars that have erupted in historical time. This study presents a preliminary analysis of geomorphology, hydrology, magnetic susceptibility, geochemistry and sedimentology data of a field study in August 2004. These results, photographs and topographic surveys are combined for reconstructing the post-eruptive evolution of Ukinrek East Maar. Within less than 30 years the initially polygonal shape of the crater with nearly vertical crater walls has developed into an almost elliptic form with slopes of 35 degrees inclination on debris fans between a few escarpments. The water table and the crater floor have risen significantly and the crater diameter:depth ratio increased from 3.4 to 5.7, whereas the average height of the crater rim remained almost constant. The main sub-aerial resedimentation process is formation of rock falls, rock slumps and scree resulting in debris flows and turbidites within the lake that is ice-covered throughout about half of the year. Distal lake sediments consist of laminated minerogenic clayey-sandy silts that document frequent turbidity currents. From the linear sedimentation rate of only ca 5 mm year(-1) in 17 cm long cores it may be concluded that the largest portion of the crater sediments formed within the first few months of the maar history, however, this has to be confirmed by future studies.

Aquatic insects, a major food source, were monitored for 23 years, 1977-1999, using window traps. In this paper, we focus on the relationship between the demography of five species of diving ducks and the abundance of aquatic insect species, mainly Chironomidae and Simuliidae. Production of ducks was estimated when most young were 2-4 weeks old, either as young per female (Aythya marila and Aythya fuligula) or as total young found (Melanitta nigra, Bucephala islandica, Histrionicus histrionicus). Variation between years in production of young ducks was strongly correlated with variation in the abundance of aquatic insects. Procladius islandicus and Psectrocladius barbimanus, both of which are univoltine with peak emergence in late July (when many young ducks hatch), as well as the bivoltine Orthocladius consobrinus, showed particularly high correlations with duckling numbers. In one year, 1992, catastrophic weather depressed production. Food appeared to determine production, primarily through its availability to the young. Changes in spring density of breeding ducks of all five species were negatively associated with density in the year before. Resources, estimated as food availability or reproductive success in the year before, were positively correlated with change in breeding numbers in A. marila, A. fuligula and B. islandica. Production three years earlier had a weak but significant effect on change in numbers of M. nigra.																			1386-2588	1573-5125					2004	38	2					285	295		10.1023/B:AECO.0000032058.83651.2c	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:AECO.0000032058.83651.2c													WOS:000222064400016

Invertebrate metal accumulation and toxicity from sediments affected by the Mount Polley mine disaster	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												On August 4, 2014, a tailings dam failed at the Mount Polley copper and gold mine near Likely, British Columbia, Canada, releasing approximately 25 M m(3) of contaminated water and solid tailings material into Polley and Quesnel lakes. Water, sediment, freshwater scuds (Hyalella azteca), and mayfly larvae (Ephemeroptera) were collected during the summer of 2018 from Polley Lake, affected and unaffected sites in Quesnel Lake, and both mine-contaminated and clean far-field sites as references. Analytical results indicated that invertebrates from sites affected by the tailings breach had elevated metal concentrations relative to those from non-affected or reference sites. We conducted a controlled laboratory exposure to determine if laboratory-reared Hyalella azteca metal concentrations were related to field-collected water or sediments from the same sites as the field study. Half of the replicates prevented amphipods from directly contacting sediments (water-only exposure), while the other half allowed them direct access (sediment and water exposure). Whole-body Cu concentration was highest in Hyalella exposed to substrate from the most contaminated sites as well as in treatments where they were allowed direct access to sediments. Hyalella having direct access to metal-contaminated sediments showed reduced survival and growth relative to those in reference or control treatments. These results suggest that metals from the fine sediments associated with the Mount Polley mine disaster are bioavailable and potentially toxic to epibenthic invertebrates, even several years after the initial breach.					; Pyle, Greg/A-5281-2013	Pyle, Greg/0000-0003-4338-7674; Zink, Lauren/0000-0003-1083-9136													0944-1344	1614-7499				OCT	2022	29	46					70380	70395		10.1007/s11356-022-20677-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-20677-1		MAY 2022						35585460					WOS:000797318500007

The evolution of aeolian sediments is an important factor for the environmental change, and influence human activities and migration. However, many questions, e.g., when the aeolian sediments start to accumulate, what controls their initiation and how their evolution responds to climate change and human activities, still need further studies. In this study, we present a detailed Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) chronology for both aeolian and underlying fluvial sediments from the Tiekui Desert in the eastern QB to discuss aeolian and fluvial processes, climatic changes, desert evolution, and human activities. Dating results show that: (1) underlying fluvial sediments were formed during similar to 23.9-12.1 ka, and the erosion caused by the fluvial process may provide an explanation for the absence of aeolian sediments during and before this period; (2) aeolian sediments accumulated from ca. 9-8 ka to modern times, with loess development from 9-8 ka to 1.6 ka and 1.4-0.7 ka, and dune sand accumulation at 1.6-1.4 ka and 0.7-0 ka. Through the comparison with the local and global palaeoclimatic records, we suggest that desert evolution in this region was sensitive to climatic changes induced by the Asian summer monsoon. Detailed local historical records of the past 2000 years suggest that desert evolution was also influenced by human activities. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

J	Yue, LP; Li, JX; Zheng, GZ; Li, ZP				Yue LePing; Li JianXing; Zheng GuoZhang; Li ZhiPei			Evolution of the Ordos Plateau and environmental effects	SCIENCE IN CHINA SERIES D-EARTH SCIENCES												Based on the analysis of temporary-spatial distribution, geomorphic position, contact relationship with underlying strata and grain size of red clay, we studied the formation and environmental background of red clay. During late Miocene-Pliocene, the Ordos Block finished the transformation from the basin to the plateau, which had an obvious environmental effect on the topography, indicated by the formation of highland undergoing wind erosion and lowland receiving red clay deposits. The red clay materials were sourced from dusts carried by wind energy and covered on the initial topography. Unlike Quaternary loess dust covering the overall the Loess Plateau, red clay deposited on the highland would be transported to the lowlands by wind and fluvial process. As a result, there was no continuous "Red Clay Plateau" in the Ordos region and red clay was only preserved in former lowlands. However, red clay was discontinuously distributed through the Loess Plateau and to some extent modified the initial topography. The differential uplift in interior plateau is indicated by the uplift of northern Baiyushan, central Ziwuling and southern Weibeibeishan. The Weibeibeishan Depression formed earlier and became the sedimentary center of red clay resulting in the thicker red clay deposits in Chaona, Lingtai and Xunyi. Since Quaternary the aridity in the northern plateau enhanced and accelerated loess accumulation caused the formation of the Loess Plateau. During the late Pleistocene the rapid uplift led to the enhancement of erosion. Especially after the cut-through of Sanme Lake by the Yellow River, the decline of base level caused the falling of ground water level and at the same time the increase of drainage density resulting in the enhancement of evaporation capacity, which enhanced the aridity tendency of aridity in the Loess Plateau region.

J	Hu, HY; Mylon, SE; Benoit, G				Hu, Haiying; Mylon, Steven E.; Benoit, Gaboury			Distribution of the thiols glutathione and 3-mercaptopropionic acid in Connecticut lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The spatiotemporal chemical characteristics of the water column in Linsley Pond, a freshwater lake in Connecticut, were studied from just before its stratification in April through the fall turnover in December. Two low-molecular-weight thiols, glutathione and 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA), were detected at nanomolar concentrations in the water column. GSH was detected (average concentrations were ca. 5 nmol L-1 in the particulate phase and ca. 3 nmol L-1 in the dissolved phase) in surface and near-surface waters only and covaried with chlorophyll a. Both particulate and dissolved MPA were measured in the oxic and anoxic regions. In the metalimnion, MPA concentrations were greater than in the oxic water layers above. At times, the MPA concentrations in the metalimnion were as high as those found in the anoxic hypolimnion. The MPA present at different depths in the Linsley Pond water column is most likely produced through dissimilar mechanisms. Throughout the water column, MPA may be a product of the metabolic degradation of sulfur-containing organic compounds; however, in the hypolimnetic waters, dissolved sulfide may play an important role in MPA formation through abiotic nucleophillic addition to unsaturated functionalities in dissolved organic matter. Parallel laboratory experiments were performed to assess the importance of MPA in copper speciation. The results confirmed that despite nanomolar levels in Linsley Pond, MPA does not play an important role in copper speciation. A survey of six additional lakes in Connecticut was made for detectable thiols. Only MPA was detected in four of these lakes, and its distribution was similar to that in Linsley Pond.

A large limnological dataset, consisting of 65 and 6 water bodies, respectively, on South Island and Stewart Island ( New Zealand) and 76 and 12 water bodies, respectively, in the Tasmanian highlands and coastal areas ( Australia), was constructed to assess patterns of variation in alpine and subalpine lakes in the Australasian region. With the exception of the coastal systems, most lakes were very dilute. In general, lake water chemistry resembled world average seawater cationic ratios (WASW). In addition, some New Zealand lakes fell close to the world average freshwater cationic ratios (WAFW), due to relatively high calcium concentrations, and some were dominated by magnesium due to the presence of serpentine bedrock in the catchment area. Multivariate analyses of the joint dataset revealed that the variation in chemical limnological variables was dominated by gradients in conductivity, pH and gilvin. The concurrent relationships between pH, calcium and gilvin, which enabled the differentiation of Tasmanian water bodies into limnological provinces, were absent in New Zealand. In the latter, pH and gilvin contents were not coincident, as clear-water acidic systems occurred in New Zealand. The higher diversity of freshwater bodies in New Zealand will enable independent assessment of the effects of pH and gilvin on the distribution and diversity of biota.

The aPBDEs (sum of 13 PBDE congeners, without brominated diphenyl ether 209 (BDE209) ranged from 2.6 to 49 pg g(-1) (dry weight) with an average of 21 pg g(-1), which fell at the low end of the global range. The spatial distribution presented an offshore decreasing trend towards the outer shelf and along the coastline, suggesting a direct influence of the inputs by the Yangtze River. The aPBDE concentrations were influenced by the total organic carbon of the sediment, as demonstrated by their similar spatial distributions. The aC(27) + C-29 + C-31 n-alkanes concentrations and sand % reported in the literature for sediments in the ECS presented similar spatial distributions as aPBDEs, which suggests that a considerable part of aPBDEs may come from the Yangtze River and that grain size plays an important role in PBDE accumulation. The three dominant congeners were BDE28 (19.8 %), BDE47 (26.4 %), and BDE99 (16.8 %). The present study compared the congener patterns of the sedimentary PBDEs with those of commercial products. The results indicated the possible use of penta-BDE in the Yangtze River Basin in a wide range or the fractionation and transformation of PBDE congeners during their long-range transport.

This study presents climatic variations that occurred between 5412 and 419 cal. yr BP (C-14 AMS chronology). Directly recharged by meltwater from Khardung glacier, this proglacial lake provides a complete record of past climatic variability due to continuous sedimentation and this attribute makes it an exceptionally important geochronological archive for climatic studies. This first high-resolution palaeolimnology record from Karakoram Himalayas shows intermittent warm and cold periods in which the cold events are short but sudden events recorded at 5700, 4600, 4400, 4200, 3800, 3500, 3000, 1800-1700, 1200, 910, 840 and 770-710 cal. yr BP. Between 5412 and 4840 cal. yr BP, an oxic lake condition existed with freeze-thaw action, prominent weathering, more sediment generation and less organic productivity. The following period till 4410 cal. yr BP was cold and dry, a transition phase to the next warmer phase. Between 4410 and 2064 cal. yr BP, climate ameliorated to somewhat moderate warm climate and relatively high lake levels. Glacial melting due to a warm climate resulted in high TOC%, and well-preserved OM indicating reducing conditions in the lake system. From 2064 to 1711 cal. yr BP cold conditions and from 1272 to 1182 cal. yr BP warmer conditions are seen with large appearance in Amphora ovalis indicating increased nutrients input and moderate water levels. This was followed by warmer climatic conditions between 1182 and 958 cal. yr BP. LIA in the region is experienced between 958 and 644 cal. yr BP with anoxic condition. Between 644 and 419 cal. yr BP, climatic condition was again warmer comparatively. However, this warming was not so severe and only had a regional impact.

Fluctuations at the ends of the lake are opposite in phase and accompanied in the central lake by strong shears across the thermocline. These are basin-wide baroclinic disturbances which are forced by wind. A numerical, one-dimensional, two-layer, shallow-water model incorporating nonlinear and frictional effects in a rectangular basin forced by wind was first tested with idealized wind impulses. The results do not resemble the observed thermocline motion. However, when this simple model is forced with wind data from a nearby shore site, there is reasonable agreement between the model results and observed long-period thermocline motions in Lake Champlain. Dispersion effects appear to be negligible here. This contrasts with other long, narrow lakes where dispersion effects are important and internal surges are followed by wave trains resembling the soliton solutions of the Korteweg-deVries equation. A possible explanation for the different regime in Lake Champlain may be found in its unique bathymetry with sloping bottom at the ends and numerous embayments on the sides that provide traps to collect wind-driven warm water and then release it slowly during recovery of equilibrium, preventing the formation of steep fronts and soliton wave trains.

Tissue content of nitrogen and phosphorus was employed as an index of element availability in lakes from whic plants were collected. This required establishment in the laboratory of the critical level for each element, that is.the minimum tissue content associated with maximum growth. To establish critical levels, a system was developed for culturing algae-free plants in a synthetic nutrient medium. The critical nitrogen content for the several species studied was approximately 1.3%; the comparable phosphorus value was 0.13%. The nitrogen and phosphorus contents of 13 species of aquatic plants collected during the summer from nine lakes were compared with the critical concentrations. In nine samples obtained mostly during periods of heaviest plant growth, the phosphorus content was at or below the critical level; in no sample was the nitrogen content less than the critical concentration. The results indicated that in all but one of the lakes, phosphorus supply was more likely to limit higher aquatic plant growth than was nitrogen. The primary importance of this study is as an initial step in the development of a satisfactory technique for evaluating nutrient supplies in natural waters.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1966	11	4					529	+		10.4319/lo.1966.11.4.0529	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1966.11.4.0529													WOS:A19668521700010

Secondary contact between two divergent lineages of grayling Thymallus in the lower Enisey basin and its taxonomic implications	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												A contact zone between two widespread divergent lineages of grayling Thymallus sp. has been identified in the lower Enisey basin (Khantaiskoye Lake) in north central Siberia (Russia). Sequences of the mitochondrial DNA control region revealed two lineages with 2.6% divergence. Haplotypes from these two lineages clearly fall within two previously described clades, one presumably corresponding to Arctic grayling Thymallus arcticus found throughout the Siberian coastal zone as well as North America, and the other corresponding to grayling found elsewhere in the Enisey basin, including Lake Baikal and its tributaries. Allelic variation at seven microsatellite loci strongly suggests reproductive isolation in sympatry between these two lineages in Khantaiskoye Lake. Integration of these new data with existing knowledge on Thymallus throughout its Siberian range supports a taxonomic revision. The currently recognized subspecific lineages of Arctic grayling along the Siberian Arctic coast as well as grayling from North America should probably be regarded as T arcticus. Arctic grayling, however, are limited to the coastal zone and lower reaches of the Enisey. Most of the Enisey basin, including Lake Baikal and its tributaries are occupied by another taxon, which should be recognized as Thymallus boicalensis. This perspective strictly follows evolutionary principles, eliminates the use of four sub-specific names and circumvents the illogical mosaic distribution of T arcticus arcticus, which nevertheless does not represent a monophyletic lineage.

Variations of δ18O in Rivers of Crimea in Winter	WATER RESOURCES												The results of studies of variations of delta O-18 values in river water in Crimea Peninsula in January-February 2015-2017 are given. The variation range of delta O-18 in river water over the three years of studies never exceeded 3 parts per thousand. A tendency toward an increase in delta O-18 in the water of the Salgir, Kacha, Al'ma, Bel'bek, Biyuk-Karasu from their sources to mouths was identified and explained by a decrease in evaporation in the mouth areas of the rivers relative to their sources and upper reaches, and the inflow of isotopically light precipitation (rain and snow) into the rivers in their upper reaches. The values of delta O-18 in waters of the rivers with regulated stream were found to increase under the effect of the Simferopol Reservoir on the Salgir River and the Izobil'nenskoe Reservoir on the Ulu-Zen' River. The values of delta O-18 in the upper reaches of the large rivers of Kacha and Bel'bek (the northwestern slope of the Crimean Mountains) vary from -8.7 to -9.7 parts per thousand, except for the rivers of Al'ma (-7.7 parts per thousand) and Kokozka (-10.2 parts per thousand) because of the different shares of groundwater in the recharge of these rivers.

Flavobacteria are known to be transmitted horizontally; however, vertical transmission has been suspected but proven only for one fish-pathogenic flavobacterial species (e.g., Flavobacterium psychrophilum). Herein, we report on the isolation and molecular identification of multiple Flavobacterium and Chryseobacterium taxa from the ovarian fluid and eggs of feral Great Lakes Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Identified egg- and ovarian fluid-associated flavobacteria were either well-known flavobacterial fish pathogens (e.g., F. psychrophilum and F. columnare), most similar to emerging fish-associated flavobacteria (e.g., F. spartansii, F. tructae, F. piscis, C. piscium, C. scophthalmum), or were distinct from all other described Chryseobacterium and Flavobacterium spp., as determined by phylogenetic analyses using neighbor-joining, Bayesian, and Maximum Likelihood methodologies. The gamete-associated flavobacteria fell into three groups (e.g., those that were recovered from the ovarian fluid but not eggs; those that were recovered from the ovarian fluid and eggs; and those that were recovered from eggs but not ovarian fluid), a portion of which were recovered from eggs that were surface disinfected with iodophor at the commonly used dose and duration for egg disinfection. Some gamete-associated flavobacteria were also found in renal, splenic, and neurological tissues. Systemic polymicrobial infections comprised of F. psychrophilum and F. columnare were also detected at nearly an 11% prevalence. This study highlights the potential role that sexual products of female Great Lakes Chinook salmon may play in the transmission of fish-associated flavobacteria.

However, high-resolution time series reflecting past moisture variability in the region are scarce, thus preventing a full understanding of the hydroclimatic evolution. Here we present the results of multi-proxy analysis of a sediment core spanning the past 900 years from Tiewaike Lake in the Altai Mountains, northern Xinjiang. The climatic proxies measured include grain size, organic matter and carbonate content, C/N ratio, and the stable carbon isotope composition of bulk organic matter. The results show that over the past 900 years the climatic evolution of the study area can be divided into distinct hydroclimatic phases: the arid Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA, similar to 1090-1430 AD), the humid Little Ice Age (LIA, 1430-1940 AD), and the arid Current Warm Period (CWP, 1940-2012 AD). During the LIA, the water level at Tiewaike Lake was overall higher than during the other climatic intervals; in addition, the LIA climate was unstable and characterized by six intervals with the occurrence of heavy precipitation events on a multi-decadal timescale. A humid, unstable climate during the LIA is also suggested by climatic records from adjacent regions. Our results support the view that over the past millennium, on a multi-centennial timescale, the moisture variations in ACA were generally out-of-phase with those in the region affected by the Asian summer monsoon. The humid, unstable LIA climate in ACA may have been associated with changes in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index and/or with variations in solar irradiance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

The Preservation Potential of Coastal Coseismic and Tsunami Evidence Observed Following the 2012 Mw 7.8 Haida Gwaii Thrust Earthquake	BULLETIN OF THE SEISMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												We describe near-field coseismic and tsunami evidence collected following the 28 October 2012 M-w 7.8 thrust earthquake that occurred offshore western Haida Gwaii, British Columbia, and discuss factors that influence its extent and preservation potential. Observations indicate minor geomorphic and sedimentological impacts on the rugged and unpopulated west coast of the islands, despite widespread coastal coseismic subsidence (similar to 0: 5 m), triggered landslides, and tsunami waves exceeding 3 m in runup (maximum 13 m) along similar to 230 km of coastline. Evidence left by the tsunami was minimal, likely because it occurred during a low tide that restricted its onshore reach, its flow depth, and its capacity to entrain and transport significant amounts of clastic sediment, sources of which are minimal or absent on the dominantly steep, rocky coastline. It is unlikely that subaerial evidence of coseismic subsidence and tsunami inundation will be recognizably recorded in the coastal stratigraphy of western Haida Gwaii, due to the relatively small magnitude of subsidence, a lack of suitable coastal environments such as tidal marshes to record paleoelevation differences, sedimentation rates that are too low to bury a paleoseismic or paleotsunami record, and long-term relative sea level fall leading to erosion and bioturbation. A higher preservation potential is likely for tsunami deposits in coastal lakes, ponds, and bogs, as well as coseismic slope failure deposits offshore, in lakes and in sheltered fjords. Our findings imply that large tsuna-migenic earthquakes are likely undersampled in the paleoseismic record of Haida Gwaii and of other plate margins with similar characteristics.					; Leonard, Lucinda/AAF-2484-2020	Leonard, Lucinda/0000-0002-6492-7660; 													0037-1106	1943-3573				MAY	2015	105	2B					1280	1289		10.1785/0120140193	http://dx.doi.org/10.1785/0120140193													WOS:000353692800019

The reconstruction of shore displacement was based on diatom analysis of radiocarbon-dated sediment cores from three lake basins combined with previously published lake isolation data. The resulting curve was used to construct palaeogeographical maps for selected time windows. Land-cover changes were inferred from pollen data from three lakes using the Landscape Reconstruction Algorithm with its two models REVEALS and LOVE. Our data suggest that people took advantage of the land gained due to an overall fall in relative sea level from similar to 35 to similar to 3 metres above sea level (m a.s.l.) over the last 10 000 years, interrupted by periods of transgression and highstands. A sea-level regression of similar to 16 m occurred between 10 000 and 8500 cal a BP followed by an similar to 3-4-m sea-level rise, reaching similar to 22 m a.s.l. at similar to 7500 cal a BP, which corresponds to the maximum Littorina Sea shoreline in the area. The available archaeological findings for the Mesolithic and Early Neolithic (8950-5450 cal a BP) agree well with the shore displacement curve showing that settlements and human activities were concentrated along or above the shorelines as defined from our study. During the transgression after 8500 cal a BP, however, seasonal settlements were submerged (as shown by findings of polished stone tools and hearths buried in sand) and used again during the subsequent regression after 4600 cal a BP. The Iron Age (2450-900 cal a BP) corresponds partly to a highstand at similar to 11 m a.s.l. between 3600 and 2000 cal a BP and partly to a rapid regression of similar to 8 m between 2000 and 1500 cal a BP, and both periods coincide with known human activities along the contemporaneous shoreline. The rapid regression after 2000 cal a BP corresponds to an increase of both regional and local landscape openness and the beginning of a continuous record of crop cultivation.

J	Dumas, J; Hare, L				Dumas, Julie; Hare, Landis			The internal distribution of nickel and thallium in two freshwater invertebrates and its relevance to trophic transfer	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Although nickel and thallium are present at potentially harmful concentrations in some lakes, there is little information on their bioaccumulation and transfer up aquatic food webs. To measure the propensity of animals for accumulating and transferring these contaminants along food chains, we exposed two common types of invertebrates, an insect (Chironomus riparius) and a worm (Tubifex tubifex), to these metals spiked into sediment. We then measured the subcellular distribution of Ni and Tl in these invertebrates to estimate the likelihood that these metals will have toxic effects on these prey or be transferred to higher trophic levels. In both species, at least half of their Ni and Tl was present in fractions that are purportedly detoxified (granules and metal-binding proteins). Furthermore, based on information in the literature concerning prey subcellular fractions that are likely to be trophically available (TAM), we estimate that much of the Ni and Tl in these animals (43-84%) is available for transfer to a predator. To test this prediction, we fed these invertebrates to the alderfly Sialis velata, and measured the efficiency with which this predator assimilated Ni and Tl from each prey type. The majority of both trace metals (58-83%) was assimilated by the predator, which suggests that these contaminants would be easily transferred along aquatic food chains and that models describing Ni and Tl accumulation by aquatic animals should consider food as a source of these metals. The proportion of metal that could potentially be taken up by a consumer (% TAM) and the actual percentage assimilated by S. velata fell on or reasonably close to a 1:1 line for the 4 prey-metal combinations.																			0013-936X	1520-5851				JUL 15	2008	42	14					5144	5149		10.1021/es800378j	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es800378j								18754361					WOS:000257620000022

Such records, however, are often at insufficient resolution to discern centennial-scale changes. In caves where the water table is closely controlled by sea level, active periods of speleothem growth constraining maximum sea level, used in combination with marine overgrowths constraining minimum sea level, are a promising alternative archive recording sea-level variability at higher resolution. Here, we present a U-Th-dated early-middle Holocene speleothem record from a submerged cave on the tectonically stable Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. Our record shows that polychaetes (Annelida, Polychaeta) colonised a sub-aerially deposited stalagmite during four individual submergence events. Submergence events occurred at approximately 8.9, 8.6, 8.4 and 6.0ka, which we attribute to previously unrecognised minor sea-level oscillation events (OE1-OE4) above and below -6.12 +/- 0.1m relative to present sea level (r.s.l.). Combining these results with mangrove-derived relative sea-level constraints from another submerged cave on the Yucatan Peninsula, we are able to suggest that OE1 and OE2 did not reach as high as -5.26m r.s.l., but that OE3 and OE4 exceeded -5.22m r.s.l. We conclude that subsidence of the North American ice-load bulge was the main cause of relative sea-level rise. Superimposed on the glacio-isostatic adjustment were periods of widespread northern hemisphere cooling and ice margin re-advance, resulting in a relative sea-level fall on four occasions during the early-middle Holocene.

WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY					7th IWA International Specialised Conference on Diffuse Pollution and Basin Management	AUG 17-21, 2003	Dublin, IRELAND	IWA				Lake Peipsi (3,555 km(2), mean depth 7.1 m) located on the border of Estonia and Russia is the largest transboundary lake in Europe. L. Peipsi consists of three parts. The shared largest northern part L. Peipsi s.s. (2,611 km(2), 8.3 m) and the southern L. Pihkva (708 km(2), 3.8 m) which belongs mainly to Russia are connected by the river-shaped L. Lammijarv (236 km(2), 2.5 m). The catchment area (44,245 km(2) without lake area) is shared between Estonia (33.3%), Russia (58.6%) and Latvia (8%). Intensive eutrophication of L. Peipsi started in the 1970s. The biomass of N-2-fixing cyanobacteria was low at heavy nutrient loading in the 1980s. After the collapse of soviet-type agriculture in the early 1990s, the loading of nitrogen sharply decreased. A certain improvement of L. Peipsi s.s. was noticed at the beginning of the 1990s together with the temporary reduction of phosphorus loading from Estonian catchment while in recent years a destabilisation of the ecosystem has been observed. This deterioration has been expressed mainly as intensive blue-green blooms and fish-kills in summer. Reappearance of blooms has been explained by the decrease in N/P loading ratio due to reduced N discharge while in some periods increased phosphorus loading could have supported this trend.

Solms) is an invasive aquatic macrophyte associated with major negative economic and ecological impacts to the Lake Victoria region since the plant's establishment in Uganda in the 1980s. Reliable estimates of water hyacinth distribution and extent are required to gauge the severity of the problem through time, relate water hyacinth abundance to environmental factors, identify areas requiring management action, and assess the efficacy of management actions. To provide such estimates and demonstrate the utility of remote sensing for this application, we processed and analyzed remotely sensed imagery to determine the distribution and extent of water hyacinth. Maps were produced and coverage was quantified using a hybrid unsupervised image classification approach with manual editing for each of the riparian countries of Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda, as well as for numerous gulfs and bays. A similar procedure was carried out for selected lakes in the Rwanda-Tanzania borderlands lakes region in the Kagera River basin. Results confirm the severity of the water hyacinth infestation, especially in the northern parts of the lake. A maximum lake-wide extent of at least 17,374 ha was attained in 1998. Following this, a combination of factors, including conditions associated with the 1997 to 1998 El Nino and biocontrol with water hyacinth weevils, appear to have contributed to a major decline in water hyacinth in the most affected parts of the lake. Some lakes in the Kagera basin, such as Lake Mihindi, Rwanda, were severely infested in the late 1990s, but the level of infestation in most of these decreased markedly by the early 2000s.																			0146-6623					JUL	2004	42						73	84																WOS:000227098900001

J	Hodges, BR; Imberger, J; Saggio, A; Winters, KB				Hodges, BR; Imberger, J; Saggio, A; Winters, KB			Modeling basin-scale internal waves in a stratified lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Basin-scale internal waves provide the driving forces for vertical and horizontal fluxes in a stratified lake below the wind-mixed layer. Thus, correct modeling of lake mixing and transport requires accurate modeling of basin-scale internal waves: examining this capability with a hydrostatic, z-coordinate three-dimensional (3D) numerical model at coarse grid resolutions is the focus of this paper. It is demonstrated that capturing the correct thermocline forcing with a 3D mixed-layer model for surface dynamics results in a good representation of low-frequency internal wave dynamics. The 3D estuary and lake computer model ELCOM is applied to modeling Lake Kinneret, Israel, and is compared with field data under summer stratification conditions to identify and illustrate the spatial structure of the lowest-mode basin-scale Kelvin and Poincare waves that provide the largest two peaks in the internal wave energy spectra. The model solves the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations using a semi-implicit method similar to the momentum solution in the TRIM code with the addition of quadratic Euler-Lagrange discretization, scalar (e.g., temperature) transport using a conservative flux-limited approach, and elimination of vertical diffusion terms in the governing equations. A detailed description is provided of turbulence closure for the vertical Reynolds stress terms and vertical turbulent transport using a 3D mixed-layer model parameterized on wind and shear energy fluxes instead of the convential eddy viscosity/diffusivity assumption. This approach gives a good representation of the depth of the mixed-layer at coarse vertical grid resolutions that allows the internal waves to be energized correctly at the basin scale.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	2000	45	7					1603	1620		10.4319/lo.2000.45.7.1603	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2000.45.7.1603													WOS:000165267100014

Presence of Bucephalus polymorphus, Echinoparyphium recurvatum and Aspidogaster limacoides (Platodes, Trematoda) in the visceral mass of Dreissena polymorpha (Mollusca, Bivalvia)	HELMINTHOLOGIA												The invasive bivalve species Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas, 1771) has become one of the most dominant spe-cies in many lakes and rivers of Europe and North Ame-rica. The aim of this study was to investigate changes in the structure of the visceral mass depending on the repro-ductive cycle and to determine the presence and effects of trematodes on the zebra mussel. Mussels were collected from the Dubrava dam reservoir during eight sampling sessions from January to December 2000. For histological analysis, 80 mussels were placed in Bouin's fixative for 24 hours, embedded in paraffin and cut with a microtome into 10 mu m slices. The sections were then stained with haema-toxylin and eosin. Analysis of non-infected bivalves indi-cated that gametogenesis started in late summer, while spawning began in April. In July, the majority of mussels were in the post-spawning stage. Two mussels were in-fected with Bucephalus polymorphus, one with Echi-noparyphium recurvatum and one with Aspidogaster lima-coides. Obtained results demonstrated that the gonads were the most affected organs in mussels infected by B. poly-morphus, the infection by A. limacoides resulted in a sig-nificant reduction of all investigated organs, while the infection by E. recurvatum had no visible pathogenic changes in the structure of visceral mass.

J	Berry, HA; Lembi, CA				Berry, HA; Lembi, CA			Effects of temperature and irradiance on the seasonal variation of a Spirogyra (chlorophyta) population in a midwestern lake (USA)	JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												Although Spirogyra Link (1820) is a common mat-forming filamentous alga in fresh waters, little is known of its ecology. A 2-year field study in Surrey Lake, Indiana, showed that it grew primarily in the spring of each year. The population consisted of four morphologically distinct filamentous forms, each exhibiting its own seasonal distribution. A 45-mum-wide filament was present from February to late April or early May, a 70-mum-wide form was present from late April to mid-June, a 100-mum-wide form was present from February to mid-June, and a 130-mum-wide form appeared only in February of I of 2 study years. The 70- and 100-mum-wide forms contributed to the peak amount of biomass observed in late May and early June. Multiple regression analysis indicated that the presence of the 45-, 70-, and 100-mum-wide forms was negatively correlated with temperature. Presence of the 130-mum-wide form was negatively correlated with irradiance. Isolates of these filament forms were exposed to temperature (15, 25, and 35 degrees C)/irradiance (0, 60, 200, 400, 900, and 1500 mu mol.m(-2) s(-1)) combinations in the laboratory. Growth rates of the 45-mum-wide form were negative at all irradiances at 35 degrees C, suggesting that this form is susceptible to high water temperatures. However, growth rates of the other forms did not vary at the different temperatures or at irradiances of 60 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) or above. Net photosynthesis was negative at 35 degrees C and 1500 pmol.m(-2).s(-1) for the 100- and 130-mum-wide forms but positive for the 70-mum-wide form, All forms lost mat cohesiveness in the dark, and the 100- and 130-mum-wide forms lost mat cohesiveness under high irradiances and temperature. Thus, the morphological forms differed in their responses to irradiance and temperature. We hypothesize that the rapid disappearance of Spirogyra populations in the field is due to loss of mat cohesiveness under conditions of reduced net photosynthesis, for example, at no to low light for all forms or at high light and high temperatures for the 100- and 130-mum-wide forms. Low light conditions can occur in the interior of mats as they grow and thicken or under shade produced by other algae.

Mg-Rich Authigenic Carbonates in Coastal Facies of the Vtoroe Zasechnoe Lake (Southwest Siberia): First Assessment and Possible Mechanisms of Formation	MINERALS												The formation of Mg-rich carbonates in continental lakes throughout the world is highly relevant to irreversible CO2 sequestration and the reconstruction of paleo-sedimentary environments. Here, preliminary results on Mg-rich carbonate formation at the coastal zone of Lake Vtoroe Zasechnoe, representing the Setovskiye group of water bodies located in the forest-steppe zone of Southwest Western Siberia, are reported. The Setovskiye lakes are Cl--Na+-(SO42-) type, alkaline, and medium or highly saline. The results of microscopic and mineralogical studies of microbialites from shallow coastal waters of Lake Vtoroe Zasechnoe demonstrated that Mg in the studied lake was precipitated in the form of hydrous Mg carbonates, which occur as radially divergent crystals that form clusters in a dumbbell or star shape. It is possible that hydrous Mg carbonate forms due to the mineralization of exopolymeric substances (EPS) around bacterial cells within the algal mats. Therefore, the Vtoroe Zasechnoe Lake represents a rare case of Mg-carbonates formation under contemporary lacustrine conditions. Further research on this, as well as other lakes of Setovskiye group, is needed for a better understanding of the possible role of biomineralization and abiotic mechanisms, such as winter freezing and solute concentration, in the formation of authigenic Mg carbonate in modern aquatic environments.

J	Auer, NA; Baker, EA				Auer, NA; Baker, EA			Duration and drift of larval lake sturgeon in the Sturgeon River, Michigan	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY					4th International Symposium on Strugeon	JUL 08-13, 2001	OSHKOSH, WISCONSIN					Recovery of lake sturgeon populations in the Great Lakes basin is now a focus of binational, federal, provincial, state and tribal management agencies; however, efforts to restore and rehabilitate stocks will be ineffective until early life history strategies are understood. De ning the extent and duration of larval drift will help to protect and re-establish populations of lake sturgeon, Acipenser fulvescens. The stages of early-life, from egg to about 250 mm total length (TL), are believed to be the most vulnerable to factors affecting survival. Drift of larvae was monitored during 8 of the 9 years between 1992 and 2000 using drift nets set 14,26,35,45 and 61 km below the spawning site on the Sturgeon River, Michigan. Natural river water levels varied between years and influenced drift sampling and success of spawning and hatch. Between 1992 and 2000, total annual catch of drifting larval lake sturgeon varied from three to 423 individuals, with 978 larvae collected over the 8 years. Larvae drifted as a 'plug' and became more dilute and spread out over time with distance downstream. This study has shown that (i) lake sturgeon larvae drift to 26 river kilometers (rkm) below the spawning site within 15 to 27 days after spawning and to 45 rkm within 25 to 40 days after spawning; (ii) the average size of the larvae increases with distance downstream; (iii) drifting larvae are not distributed uniformly in space or time; (iv) two peaks in spawning were common and spawning seems to be related to the phase of the new moon in years without heavy spring flows; and ( v) that the lower river may be an important habitat for young-of-the-year sturgeons.																			0175-8659					DEC	2002	18	4-6					557	564		10.1046/j.1439-0426.2002.00393.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1439-0426.2002.00393.x													WOS:000179913400052
J	Ling, ZY; Yang, SL; Wang, X; Wang, JP; Xia, DS; Chen, FH				Ling, Zhiyong; Yang, Shengli; Wang, Xin; Wang, Jianping; Xia, Dunsheng; Chen, Fahu			Spatial-temporal differentiation of eolian sediments in the Yarlung Tsangpo catchment, Tibetan Plateau, and response to global climate change since the Last Glaciation	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Eolian sediments, an important paleoenvironmental archive, are widespread in the Yarlung Tsangpo River (YTR) valley of the southern Tibetan Plateau (TP), but their chronology and spatial-temporal differentiation are poorly understood. And it is not clear whether eolian accumulation is controlled by global climate changes, or local paleoenvironment, or both. In this study, we applied quartz OSL dating to 30 eolian sediment samples (sandy loess and eolian sand) from eight profiles in the YTR catchment. Our new dates were combined with 72 previously published eolian sediment ages (OSL/TL and C-14) for the YTR catchment to analyze the response of eolian accumulation to paleoenvironmental changes. The overall dataset has eolian accumulation spanning the period from the Last Interglacial through to the Little Ice Age, ranging from 84.6 +/- 8.7 ka BP (possibly as old as 118 +/- 11 ka BP) to 0.4 +/- 0.1 ka BP, withmost occurring since the Late Glacial Period (15 ka BP), which suggests that the preservation of eolian deposits is controlled by geologic recirculation. Probability density function distributions (PDFs) of eolian ages from different parts of the YTR catchment show different age clusters, suggesting that factors controlling eolian accumulation vary across the catchment, so that spatial-temporal disparities are inherent in the system. To investigate the effect of regional and global paleoclimate since the Last Glacial Maximum(LGM) on eolian deposition processes in the YTR, we compared the PDF of ages fromthe combined dataset with a range of paleoclimate proxies. The PDF shows significant fluctuations since the LGM, including the Younger Dryas cold event. There is no consistent eolian sediment response to changes of the 30 degrees N summer insolation, Asian SummerMonsoon, and westerlies. Phases of strong eolian sediment accumulation in the YTR basin do not show a simple correspondence with the classical global climate curve, suggesting that eolian processes in the alpine valley environment may be modified by local responses to these changes.

The model results suggest that, due to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation shift that occurred in 1976, the ice-cover duration is shorter (4 days) due to earlier BU in spring, and thinner (0.05 m) due to a reduction in the formation of snow ice. Sensitivity tests indicate that air-temperature changes cause the duration change, and snow-depth changes cause the total ice-thickness and composition change. The role of annual and monthly air-temperature and snow-depth changes is examined further in a series of experiments designed to elucidate the possible effects of future climate change. Air temperature is varied in VC increments between -4 and +4 degrees C, and snow depth is varied in 25% increments between -100% and +100% of the long-term averages for 1952-75 and 1977-2000. The FU and BU dates (ice duration) are most affected by annual air-temperature change. Total ice thickness and composition are most affected by annual and monthly snow-depth change. A key finding is that snow-depth increases cause total ice thickness to increase as a consequence of increased snow-ice formation on top of the ice cover at the expense of congelation-ice formation at the bottom of the ice cover.

The Edremit travertines and tufas extend over nearly160 km(2) within the boundaries of the Edremit area to the east of Lake Van (eastern Turkey), and yield important evidence towards understanding the neotectonics of the region. The Edremit travertines and tufas were studied throughout their full stratigraphic extent, the factors controlling the formation of these deposits were examined, and the succession was sampled for U/Th analysis. Travertine formation was found to occur from 542-29.7 ka, with two different tufa formation periods: from 29.7-5.8 ka and 5.8-2.08 ka. Pauses in travertine formation (palaeosols) were identified from 510-470 ka, 289-269 ka and 91-34 ka. Our study showed that climate parameters affected the formation of tufa, while the Edremit travertines developed under the control of tectonism. The Van Fault is directly associated with travertine development and its age was identified as 542 ka or older. Since the Gurpinar Fault, one of the most important faults in the region, is effective in shaping the southern slope of the travertines and limiting the movement of the Van Fault, its age should be younger than 542.4 ka. The Elmalik Fault played an active role in the formation of the Edremit tufas and is proposed to be 29.7 ka in age, from stratigraphic relationships in the region.

Rapid and multiplexed measurement of such waterborne pathogens is vital and the challenge is to instantly detect in these liquid samples different types of pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity. In this work, we propose a biosensing system in which the bacteria are labelled with streptavidin coated magnetic markers (MPs magnetic particles) forming compounds (MLBs magnetically labelled bacteria). Video microscopy in combination with a particle tracking software are used for their detection and quantification. When the liquid containing the MLBs is introduced into the developed, microfluidic platform, the MLBs are accelerated towards the outlet by means of a magnetic field gradient generated by integrated microconductors, which are sequentially switched ON and OFF by a microcontroller. The velocities of the MLBs and that of reference MPs, suspended in the same liquid in a parallel reference microfluidic channel, are calculated and compared in real time by a digital camera mounted on a conventional optical microscope in combination with a particle trajectory tracking software. The MLBs will be slower than the reference MPs due to the enhanced Stokes' drag force exerted on them, resulting from their greater volume and altered hydrodynamic shape. The results of the investigation showed that the parameters obtained from this method emerged as reliable predictors for E. coli concentrations.

In contrast, all size groups of non-native stocked brown trout were mostly restricted to the epibenthic habitat. Age-specific lengths were generally larger for non-native than for native stocked trout, which were larger than native fish, However, growth rate between age 3 and 4 was significantly lower for non-native stocked fish than for native and native stocked fish. Differences in body length were mainly due to strain but also to some extent to habitat. Native fish had significantly fuller stomachs in the pelagic than in the epibenthic habitat in summer. Epibenthic non-native fish had significantly fuller stomachs than native and native stocked fish in August but not in July. Native and native stocked fish fed mainly on surface insects and planktonic crustaceans in both habitats. We hypothesize that the non-native brown trout stocked in Lake Tesse do not use the pelagic habitat in the home lake and are therefore less adapted to utilize such habitat than populations originating from lakes where pelagic habitat is available.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				OCT	1995	52	10					2159	2167		10.1139/f95-808	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f95-808													WOS:A1995TQ59400009

A few days later, this phenomenon spread throughout the lake. A first analysis by optical microscopy revealed that the origin of the black spot was a ciliated protozoan. Ciliates represent a small percentage of the total zooplanktonic community of Lake Garda and have never produced bloom episodes. Using morphological and molecular analysis, we characterized the protozoan responsible for the bloom as Stentor amethystinus and its symbiotic algae as a Chlorella sp. Continuous monitoring of the northeast of Lake Garda showed that the apex of the S. amethystinus bloom took place during the first 20 days of August, and the highest density of S. amethystinus occurred in the euphotic zone. During this period, high chlorophyll a values were obtained in water samples collected from the euphotic zone due to the presence of the endosymbiont Chlorella. After early September, the black spot completely disappeared, and the causative organism was detected at low concentration only in the southern basin of the lake. The results obtained on the progress of the black spot phenomenon led us to hypothesize that: (i) S. amethystinus was recently introduced in Lake Garda by anthropogenic activities or it was already a member of the zooplanktonic community but at a very low concentration; (ii) S. amethystinus blooms may have been driven by an unusual high availability of total phosphorous in the euphotic zone and (iii) Lake Garda is not the preferred habitat for S. amethystinus.

Holocene climate and seasonality of shell collection at the Dundas Islands Group, northern British Columbia, Canada-A bivalve sclerochronological approach	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												To analyze environmental changes and the seasonality of shell collection in British Columbia during the Holocene, oxygen isotopes were measured from modern and archeological (1337-7438 cal yr BP) shells of the butter clam Saxidomus gigantea. 1697 discrete isotope samples were taken from two modern and 27 archeological shells with a high temporal resolution (sub-seasonal up to daily). Archeological shells were collected from five shell midden sites on the Dundas Islands Group, northern British Columbia, Canada. The oxygen isotope data reveal clear annual cycles, with the most positive delta O-18(shell) values occurring during the cold season (slower growth, annual growth line formation) and the most negative delta O-18(shell) values during the warm season (period of faster growth). Whereas the most positive delta O-18(shell) values remained relatively constant throughout the Holocene, the warm season delta O-18(shell) values reflected considerable variability. Summer values observed in the early and late Holocene became approximately 1 parts per thousand. more negative around 2500-3000 and 5500-6000 BP, implying lower salinity during the Mid-Holocene. Variations in the oxygen isotopic composition of marine shells reflect changes in temperature and salinity. Such large changes in delta O-18(shell) are unlikely being caused by temperature changes alone. Furthermore, the large annual delta O-18(shell) amplitude of 3.29-6.56 parts per thousand, which corresponds to a temperature range of 14.5-29.0 degrees C, exceeds the local annual temperature range by 2.5-17.0 degrees C (0.58-3.85 parts per thousand). The shell isotope record was also compared with other proxy archives, such as pollen, lake sediments and chironomid communities. The climate changes reflected in the delta O-18(shell) record match well with environmental changes reported for British Columbia. In addition to the climate information outline above, details about the season of shell collection by the occupants of Dundas Islands can also be obtained from the oxygen isotope and sclerochronological analyses of shells. The oxygen isotope profiles reveal that the archeological shells were collected year-round through time, and that there is no difference in the collection pattern between small and large shell midden sites. This is indicative of a multi-seasonal shellfish harvesting as well as long-term variation in occupation patterns at the Dundas Islands. Despite changes in climate over the Holocene, people maintained a consistent pattern of year-round shellfish harvest. The Mid-Holocene transition is also characterized by a number of cultural changes ranging from technological changes to changes in settlement and subsistence practices of hunter-gatherer groups.

Colonial nesting waterbirds as vectors of nutrients to Lake Lesser Prespa (Greece)	INLAND WATERS												The nutrients imported by breeding waterbirds should be considered when identifying the main sources of nutrient input to lakes. Lake Lesser Prespa (Greece), including the adjacent Vromolimni pond, hosts numerous protected waterbirds that nest in densely populated colonies across the reedbeds. The accelerated eutrophication of the lake in recent years has been of increasing concern. In addition to likely large sources of nutrients (i.e., anthropogenic activities, especially agriculture), nutrient input via waterbird excrement may further trigger eutrophication. We estimated the annual phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) input by the most abundant colonial-nesting waterbirds (great white pelican, Dalmatian pelican, great cormorant, and pygmy cormorant) into the lake and investigated their influence on water and sediment quality. Near the waterbird colonies, soluble nutrient concentrations in the lake sediments were higher, and chlorophyll measurements indicated higher algal growth near these sites in summer. Stable isotope analysis suggests that near the colonies, waterbirds are responsible for nutrient loadings that affect the lake sediment. The estimated N and P nutrient input into the lake by both pelican and cormorant species is at least 1243 and 1649 kg/yr, respectively. On a landscape scale, this level of loading could be of minor importance for the lake because N and P can reach 32.8 (SD 9.3) and 38.9 (5.8) mg/m(2) per year, respectively. Locally, however, this level of loading might induce cyanobacterial blooms, illustrated by the analysis of isolated Vromolimni pond near the lake.

This study presents constraints on Miocene sea and lake level fluctuations in the Dacian Basin and on the connectivity between it and other Paratethys basins, based on the interpretation of seismic lines, a micropalaeontological study and lithofacies analysis of a large number of outcrops. It is shown that relative sea level fluctuations in the western part of the Dacian Basin during the Middle Miocene were primarily driven by tectonic activity in the nearby Carpathian Mountains. From the Maeotian (Late Miocene) onwards, however, tectonic activity was minor and relative sea level fluctuations were primarily driven by changes in basin connectivity and climate. The connection between the Central and Eastern Paratethys was broken at the end of the Middle Miocene, leading to the development of an endemic fauna in the former, but new data presented here suggest that isolation was not sustained completely as Central Paratethys species appeared in the Dacian Basin during the Maeotian (Late Miocene). Besides the isolation two falls in water level occurred in the basin during the latest Miocene: Of these, the intra-Pontian sea-level drop is the best known. We show, however, that this drop was preceded by a larger sea or lake-level drop in the late Sarmatian/Maeotian. This latter event may have affected much larger parts of the Paratethys, and we recommend more study of the bordering basins. The hypothesis that the connection between the Dacian and Central Paratethys basins was located in the region where the Danube River presently crosses the Carpathians was tested, but no supporting evidence was found.

There were very few hydrographic measurements in this region since at least early 1990s. The salinity in the western deep basin of the Aral Sea varied from about 82 psu at the surface to over 94 psu at the bottom. The absolute lake surface level was about 30.5 m. Hence, the observed salinity values were much higher, and the level much lower, than expected according to earlier predictions. The density in the western basin exhibited an extremely strong stratification of similar to11 kg/m(3) per similar to20 m in the bottom layer. The picnocline was accompanied by a temperature inversion whose magnitude was similar to4degreesC. The observed density stratification effectively isolating the lower part of the water column from surface exchanges may be responsible for the increase of summer SSTs and evaporation rates reported in previous studies. We discovered the hydrogen sulphide contamination in the bottom layer whose upper limit was at the depth of approximately 22 m. Estimates suggest that the western basin salinization occurs not only because of the local evaporation, but also because of the assimilation of the saltier eastern basin water in the course of the interbasin exchange through the connecting channel. The satellite imagery analysis, in particular the Maximum Cross-Correlation method, suggests that the circulation pattern in the Aral Sea in its present limits is cyclonic under the eastern winds that are predominant in the region throughout the year.

These changes, driven by factors such as sea-level rise, climate change, and human activities, have led to the progressive elevation of water levels in this area. As a result, a floodplain has emerged, characterized by the formation of numerous shallow lakes along the river course. However, the pattern of water-level changes in the main channel of the Yangtze River during the Holocene remains unclear. This gap in knowledge poses challenges for understanding sediment transport dynamics, the interactions between the river and its adjacent lakes, and the prevention and control of flood disasters in the Yangtze River basin. To shed light on these issues, our study compiled data on the surface elevation and water depth of 81 lakes in the mid-lower reaches of the Yangtze River basin. Additionally, we analyzed historical water-level records from the 1900s to the 1970s at eight gauging stations from Shashi to Jiangyin along the river's main stream. Our findings reveal that, particularly along the Jingjiang section, the basal elevation of most lakes is lower than the Yangtze River's water level during the dry season. Conversely, the water level of the main stream exceeds that of both the floodplain and the lakes enclosed by the Jingjiang embankment. In the tidal reach, especially within the Taihu Lake basin, the basal elevation of lakes typically falls below sea level. Meanwhile, lakes located along the section from Chenglingji to Wuhu exhibit basal elevations that correspond with the Yangtze River's annual average and dry season water levels. Given the widespread presence of lakes along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, our study introduces a new proxy for reconstructing the mean water level of the mid-lower Yangtze River in the Holocene. By analyzing sediments from Nanyi Lake and Chenyao Lake in the lower Yangtze River, we attempted to reconstruct the water level of the Yangtze River's main channel since 8 ka BP.																			1674-7313	1869-1897				SEP	2024	67	9					2924	2936		10.1007/s11430-023-1374-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11430-023-1374-y		JUL 2024											WOS:001274292800002

The present study integrates the seismic data with previously published geological maps and recent results from the La Ronge - Lynn Lake Bridge Project that provide new constraints on the lithological, structural, and tectonic framework of this collisional zone. An interpretative section, based on the seismic reflectivity and surface geological constraints, is presented. The integrated data suggest the following key elements. (1) Although an early foreland-vergent accretion history is suggested by surficial geological constraints, the predominant fabric is reflected by penetrative hinterlandward vergence. (2) A zone of more reflective lower crust with hinterland-verging fabric may represent "fossil" reflectors from a pre-collisional accretionary phase. (3) The Archean to Paleoproterozoic Sask Craton may extend in the lower middle crust to at least beneath Rottenstone Domain, consistent with what is observed along strike on other Lithoprobe seismic profiles. (4) The Needle Falls and Parker Lake shear zones do not appear to be associated with obvious reflectors, consistent with observations from Reindeer Lake, suggesting that they merely rework the Wathaman Batholith intrusive margin and are not fundamental sutures. (5) The La Ronge and Rottenstone domains show nearly identical seismic properties, consistent with recent mapping results in the Reindeer Lake area that suggest that they are temporally and, at least in part, lithologically related in the area covered by, and to the east of, seismic line S2b.																			0008-4077	1480-3313				APR	2005	42	4					421	434		10.1139/E05-025	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/E05-025													WOS:000230500000004
J	Gedda, B; Lemdahl, G; Gaillard, MJ				Gedda, B; Lemdahl, G; Gaillard, MJ			Lateglacial and Early Holocene environments inferred from a tufa deposit at Fyledalen, S-Sweden	GFF												A reinvestigation of a tufa deposit in Skane, including a number of biostratigraphical methods and chronology was carried out. The tufa was formed in a paludal environment during the time period c. 9,500 to 8,000 BP. This period is characterised by exceptional low lake levels and high summer temperatures in southern Sweden. This may suggest that optimal conditions for tufa formation at the site coincided with warm and dry climate conditions, a low groundwater table, and high evaporation. During periods with colder conditions and/or higher groundwater table pear was deposited. The changes in the local environment at and around the site were inferred from the biostratigraphical records of pollen, plant macrofossils, molluscs, and insects. The results demonstrate a development from a dwarf shrub tundra during the Late-glacial, which turned to an open birch/pine woodland around 10,000 BP. At c. 9,000 BP hazel and birch were probably the dominant tree species in the woodland. The mollusc record suggests that the woodland remained relatively open until c. 8,500 BP when tree taxa such as alder, oak and elm became established in the Fyledalen valley. The site remained a marsh throughout the studied period, however, the results indicate a succession of different marsh plant communities.					; Gädda, Björn/JZT-2820-2024; Gaillard, Marie-José/ABG-2680-2021	Gedda, Bjorn/0000-0003-3953-6411; 													1103-5897					MAR	1999	121		1				33	41		10.1080/11035899901211033	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11035899901211033													WOS:000081175100004

We conducted the first survey for alkenone biomarkers from 55 different lakes in the Northern Great Plains and Nebraska Sand Hills of the United States. Among those surveyed, we found 13 lakes that contain LCAs in the surface sediments. The highest concentrations of alkenones in sediments are found in cold (mean annual air temperature similar to 11 degrees C versus 17 degrees C in our warmest sites), brackish to mesosaline (salinity = 8.5-9.7 g/L), and alkaline (pH = 8.4-9.0) lakes with high concentrations of sodium and sulfate. The dynamics of stratification and nutrient availability also appear to play a role in LCA abundance, as early spring mixing promotes a bloom of alkenone-producing haptophytes. Four of the alkenone-containing sites contain the C-37:4 alkenone; however, we discovered an unprecedented lacustrine alkenone distribution in a cluster of lakes, with a total absence of C-37:4 alkenone. We attribute this unusual composition to a different haptophyte species and show that the sulfate:carbonate ratio may control the occurrence of these two distinct populations. We created a new in-situ temperature calibration for lacustrine sites that contain C-37:4 using a water-column calibration from Lake George, ND and show that U-37(K) is linearly correlated to lake water temperature (R-2 = 0.74), but U-37(K') is not. A number of lakes contain an unidentified compound series that elutes close to the LCAs, highlighting the importance Of routine GC-MS examination prior to using lacustrine LCAs for paleotemperature reconstructions.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of alum applications in commercial broiler houses on: (i) NH3 volatilization (in-house), (ii) poultry production, (iii) litter chemistry, and (iv) P runoff following litter application. Two farms were used for this study: one had six poultry houses and the other had four. The litter in half of the houses at each farm was treated with alum; the other houses were controls. Alum was applied at a rate of 1816 kg/house, which corresponded to 0.091 kg/bird. Each year the houses were cleaned in the spring and the litter was broadcast onto paired watersheds in tall fescue at each farm. Results from this study showed that alum applications lowered the litter pH, particularly during the first 3 to 4 wk of each growout. Reductions in litter pH resulted in less NH3 volatilization, which led to reductions in atmospheric NH3 in the alum-treated houses. Broilers grown on alum-treated litter were significantly heavier than controls (1.73 kg vs. 1.66 kg). Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentrations in runoff from pastures fertilized with alum-treated litter averaged 73% lower than that from normal litter throughout a 3-yr period. These results indicate that alum-treatment of poultry litter is a very effective best management practice that reduces nonpoint source pollution while it increases agricultural productivity.

End-Member Mixing Analysis as a Tool for the Detection of Major Storms in Lake Sediment Records	PALEOCEANOGRAPHY AND PALEOCLIMATOLOGY												Major Tropical Cyclone (TC) events cause extensive damage in coastal regions of the western North Atlantic Basin. The short instrumental record leaves significant gaps in understanding long-term trends in TC recurrence and intensity, creating uncertainty about future storm trends. Analysis of an similar to 520-year core record from Harvey Lake, located >80 km from the Atlantic coast in southwestern New Brunswick, Canada was carried out using: (a) end-member mixing analysis (EMMA) of lake sediment grain size data to identify storm-linked sedimentological processes; and (2) ITRAX X-ray fluorescence (XRF) derived element/ratios (Fe, Ti, Ca/Sr, Zr/Rb, K/Rb, and Br + Cl/Al) associated with precipitation, weathering, catchment runoff, and air masses. Three derived end members were correlated to heavy rainfall events (EM01), spring freshet (EM02), and TCs (EM03). CONISS analysis of the EMMA and XRF core data resulted in recognition of four unique climatic zones distinguished by distinct distributions of TC and rainfall/weathering/runoff/and air masses. Numerous, major (EM01) rainfall events and (EM03) TC events characterized the basal core record during the early Little Ice Age (LIAa; Zone 1) phase, terminating at similar to 1645. A near cessation of heavy rainfall and TC events differentiated the subsequent colder LIAb (similar to 1645-1825; Zone 2) and subsequent Little Ice Age Transition (similar to 1825-1895; Zone 3). A resurgence of major rainfall and TC events occurred during recovery from the LIA starting in similar to 1895 (Zone 4). EMMA provides a robust tool for recognition of TC and major rainfall events, and greatly expands the potential for paleo-storm activity research well inland from coastal regions.

Quantitative reconstructions were performed using a modern pollen-climate calibration model based on weighted-averaging partial least squares regression. The predictive ability of the model was evaluated against modern meteorological data using leave-one-out cross-validation. The prediction error for July mean temperature is c. 1.0 degreesC and for annual precipitation 340 mm. The July mean temperatures during the earliest Holocene were low, c. 11.0 degreesC, and annual precipitation was high, c. 600-800 torn. Between 8200 and 6700 cal. yr BP July mean temperatures reached their maxima, 12.5-13.0 degreesC, which are c. 1.4-1.7 degreesC higher than at present. At the same time precipitation decreased. During the late Holocene, July mean temperatures declined and the last 2000 years have been the coolest since the early Holocene. Precipitation has slightly increased. The spatial coherence between our results and of several other climate reconstructions from northern Europe indicates that the Holocene climate was strongly influenced by North Atlantic oceanic and atmospheric circulation patterns. We propose that the distinctly oceanic climate of the early Holocene was due to enhanced westerly (latitudinal) airflow which was replaced at c. 8200 cal. yr BP by a more meridional flow pattern and by the development of predominantly anticyclonic summer conditions.

A preliminary, investigation was undertaken employing specific genetic probes to characterize the cyanobacteria responsible for stromatolite construction in a range of environments, including microbial mats found in Australia not previously examined with molecular methods. Isolates of cyanobacteria were collected from stromatolites in thermal springs, hypersaline lakes, and oceanic fringes on two continents. A polymerase chain reaction specific for DNA of cyanobacterial 16S rRNA was developed, the resulting products of the DNA amplification reaction were sequenced, and the data were used to infer relatedness between the isolates studied and other members of the cyanobacterial radiation. Complete sequence was generated for the region from position 27 to 408 for 13 strains of cyanobacteria associated with stromatolites. All stromatolite-derived sequences were most closely related to cyanobacteria, as indicated by local sequence, alignment. It was possible to correlate genetic identity with morphological nomenclatures and to expand the phylogeny of benthic cyanobacteria. These inferences were also expanded to temporal variation in the dominant resident cyanobacterial species based on sampling of surface and core sinter laminations. Under the methods employed, only one cyanobacterial strain was detected in each sample, suggesting the possible dominance of a specific clonal population of cyanobacteria at any one time in the biota of the samples tested. The data indicate that internal core samples of a stromatolite at least 10 years old can be successfully analyzed by DNA-based methods to identify preserved cyanobacteria.

As a result of these operations, an appreciable amount of deicing fluid mixes with runoff and finds its way into nearby streams and lakes. The research described herein focuses on establishing the reaction rate coefficient (k) for the biological degradation of UCAR ADF-D in a sequential biological reactor under different conditions of temperature and organic load. The rate of removal of the deicing chemical follows a first-order model. It was found that, at 22-degrees-C with a food-to-microorganisms ratio (F/M) of less than or equal to 2.8, a four-fold increase in F/M reduces k values by a factor of eight. The organic load is less sensitive when F/M is equal to or greater than 2.8: a seven-fold increase in F/M decreases k by only a factor of three. Temperature is very important since, when F/M almost-equal-to 2, k returned values of 1.03, 0.29, and 0.05, respectively, for temperatures of 22-degrees-C, 10-degrees-C, and 4-degrees-C. This study clearly demonstrates that UCAR ADF-D can be treated biologically and that the rate of removal can be significantly affected by organic load and temperature.																			0273-1223						1992	26	9-11					2061	2064		10.2166/wst.1992.0661	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.1992.0661													WOS:A1992KA66900018
J	Yang, G; Yang, X; Wang, YH; Huang, XY				Yang, Guang; Yang, Xin; Wang, Yuhang; Huang, Xianyu			Impact of paleohydrological conditions on wetland organic carbon accumulation in the monsoon-arid transition zone of North China during the Holocene	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Wetlands rich in carbon are important ecosystems for storing organic carbon, with their carbon storage capacity closely linked to water levels. Therefore, it is valuable to explore the relation between paleohydrological conditions and the organic carbon accumulation in carbon-rich deposits. This study examined the total organic carbon concentration and the molecular and carbon isotope compositions of n-alkanes in Ganhai, a dried up lake located in a region transitioning from a monsoon to an arid climate in north China. The results showed that the apparent carbon accumulation rates (CAR) increased as the East Asian summer monsoon intensified (averaged at 26.5 g C m- 2 yr- 1, 1 sigma = 8.6), but decreased when precipitation levels peaked (averaged at 15.8 g C m- 2 yr- 1, 1 sigma = 2.2). The above relation between precipitation and CAR in Ganhai is supported by the correlation analysis (r = -0.35, p = 0.003). This suggests a threshold relation between wetland carbon accumulation and precipitation in this region. The output of a Bayesian multi-source mixing model, based on the molecular and carbon isotope compositions of long-chain n-alkanes, underscores the significant role of aquatic plants in influencing carbon accumulation in Ganhai during the mid-Holocene, with submersed plants dominating during high CAR periods and floating plants being more prevalent during peak precipitation. The study emphasizes the importance of understanding the hydrological threshold for carbon sequestration and vegetation restoration in carbon-rich wetlands.

Using 18O/2H, 3H/3He, 85Kr and CFCs to determine mean residence times and water origin in the Grazer and Leibnitzer Feld groundwater bodies (Austria)	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												Two groundwater bodies, Grazer Feld and Leibnitzer Feld, with surface areas of 166 and 103 km(2) respectively are characterised for the first time by measuring the combination of delta O-18/delta H-2, H-3/He-3, Kr-85, CFC-11, CFC-12 and hydrochemistry in 34 monitoring wells in 2009/2010. The timescales of groundwater recharge have been characterised by 131 delta O-18 measurements of well and surface water sampled on a seasonal basis. Most monitoring wells show a seasonal variation or indicate variable contributions of the main river Mur (0-30%, max. 70%) and/or other rivers having their recharge areas in higher altitudes. Combined delta O-18/delta H-2-measurements indicate that 65-75% of groundwater recharge in the unusual wet year of 2009 was from precipitation in the summer based on values from the Graz meteorological station. Monitoring wells downstream of gravel pit lakes show a clear evaporation trend. A boron-nitrate differentiation plot shows more frequent boron-rich water in the more urbanised Grazer Feld and more frequent nitrate-rich water in the more agricultural used Leibnitzer Feld indicating that a some of the nitrate load in the Grazer Feld comes from urban sewer water. Several lumped parameter models based on tritium input data from Graz and monthly data from the river Mur (Spielfeld) since 1977 yield a Mean Residence Time (MRT) for the Mur-water itself between 3 and 4 years in this area. Data from delta O-18, H-3/He-3 measurements at the Wagna lysimeter station supports the conclusion that 90% of the groundwaters in the Grazer Feld and 73% in the Leibnitzer Feld have MRTs of <5 years. Only in a few groundwaters were MRTs of 6-10 or 11-25 years as a result of either a long-distance water inflow in the basins or due to longer flow path in somewhat deeper wells (>20 m) with relative thicker unsaturated zones. The young MRT of groundwater from two monitoring wells in the Leibnitzer Feld was confirmed by Kr-85-measurements. Most CFC-11 and CFC-12 concentrations in the groundwater exceed the equilibration concentrations of modern concentrations in water and are therefore unsuitable for dating purposes. An enrichment factor up to 100 compared to atmospheric equilibrium concentrations and the obvious correlation of CFC-12 with SO4, Na, Cl and B in the ground waters of the Grazer Feld suggest that waste water in contact with CFC-containing material above and below ground is the source for the contamination. The dominance of very young groundwater (<5 years) indicates a recent origin of the contamination by nitrate and many other components observed in parts of the groundwater bodies. Rapid measures to reduce those sources are needed to mitigate against further deterioration of these waters. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J.; Deepak, Oshin			Late Pleistocene-Holocene vegetation and climate variability of the western Himalaya, India	JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES												Multiproxy analyses of sediment samples from a 2.7 m trench from western Himalaya have helped in the reconstruction of vegetation and climatic changes during the last ~ 15.2 ka. The data revealed that between 15.2 and 12.7 ka, the region supported alpine-scrubs and trees interspersed with meadows in a cool and moderately humid climate. The lowest d13C values and coarse-grained sediment texture indicate improved hydroclimatic conditions. The expansion of arboreals between 12.7 and 9.2 ka also suggests a warm and humid climate. Despite this, slightly higher d13C values reflect decreasing hydrological conditions. Reduced arboreals and increased d13C values imply a cold and dry climate between ca. 9.2 and 7.8 ka. The proliferation of arboreals supports a warm and humid climate from 7.8 to 5.2 ka, representing the Holocene Climate Optima. However, between 5.2 and 3.7 ka, a decrease in arboreals with associated d13C values suggest climate deterioration. Based on changes in arboreals and non-arboreals, the Late Holocene phases advocate for warm and wet (ca. 3.7-2.3 ka), cool and dry (ca. 2.3-1.7 ka), and warm and wet (1.5-0.75 ka) climatic conditions, respectively. Since 0.75 ka, a modest increase in arboreals, TOC, and a decrease in d13C values, implying that hydroclimatic conditions have improved. These findings are broadly consistent with previous Himalayan palaeoclimatic reconstructions; nevertheless, the absence of any major shift in vegetation during the younger Dryas is surprising.

The impact of large lakes on climate in the past: a possible scenario for Lake Baikal	HYDROBIOLOGIA					3rd Symposium on Species in Ancient Lakes	SEP 02-07, 2002	Quincy, WA					Ice-age periods and interglacials are the most outstanding changes of global climate in the modern quaternary period (about 2 million years). In spite of the intensive development of paleoclimatology, and the integration of extensive information from different sources, including the data from annual layers of ice cores and sediments on the bottom of lakes and seas, certain details of glaciations in Central Asia are still not yet clear. One of such questions is where the extra precipitation could have come from which would have been necessary to form some mountainous glaciations in East Asia. It is known from climatic data on modern lakes (Great Lakes, USA, and Lake Baikal, Russia) that large lakes of middle latitudes, that are not frozen for long in winter, can cause additional "lake-effected" snowfalls on their leeward coast. In this connection, there is a supposition that the existence of huge Lake Mansi in the Late Pleistocene (20-25 kyr BP, Grosswald's hypothesis, 1991) on the territory of West-Siberian Lowland, could have caused the occurrence of mountain glaciations in Siberia including ridges around Lake Baikal. We consider this hypothesis by analysing "lake-effect" in modern climate conditions. It is also shown that the long-term decrease of air temperature during ice-age periods could have been sufficient to cause relatively quick growth of mountainous glaciers, even under present conditions of precipitation.					obolkin, Vladimir/T-3884-2018; Potemkin, Vladimir/GQH-5906-2022														0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP 15	2006	568			1			249	252		10.1007/s10750-006-0307-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-006-0307-9													WOS:000240688900036

Myvatn, a lake in northern Iceland, has extraordinary midge (Chironomidae) emergences that result in large inputs of biomass and nutrients to terrestrial arthropod communities. We simulated this lake-to-land resource pulse by collecting midges from Myvatn and spreading their dried carcasses on 1-m(2) plots at a nearby site that receives very little midge deposition. We hypothesized a positive bottom-up response of detritivores that would be transmitted to their predators and would persist into the following year. We sampled the arthropod community once per month for two consecutive summers. Midge addition resulted in significantly different arthropod communities and increased densities of some taxa in both years. Detritivores, specifically Diptera larvae, Collembola, and Acari increased in midge-addition plots, and so did some predators and parasitoids. Arthropod densities were still elevated a year after midge addition, and two years of midge addition further increased the density of higher-order consumers (e.g., Coleoptera and Hymenoptera). Midge addition increased arthropod biomass by 68% after one year and 108% after two years. By manipulating the nutrient pulse delivered by midges we were able to elucidate food web consequences of midge deposition and spatial and temporal dynamics that are difficult to determine based on comparative approaches alone. Resources cross ecosystem boundaries and are assimilated over time because of life-history strategies that connect aquatic and terrestrial food webs and these systems cannot be fully understood in isolation from each other.

Both Pb-210 and Ra-226 are enriched in the anoxic deep waters compared to the oxic surface waters, respectively by a factor of 4 and 10, whereas Si-32 is depleted by a factor of approximately 2. Redox conditions in the lake appear to have no marked effect on the Si-32. Using a steady-state box model it is shown that the deep-water Si-32 concentration is controlled by underground lacustrine springs. The residence times of Pb-210, Si-32 and Ra-226 are approximately 1, approximately 10 and approximately 80 a, respectively. In the case of Si-32, where more data are available, the assessed inventory data from the overhead atmospheric fallout and that measured in the sediments agree very well as expected. The Pb-210- and Si-32-based deposition rates during the past approximately 100 a ranged from 0.8 to 1.9 mm a-1, earlier these were a factor of approximately 3-5 faster. The geochemistry of Si-32 and Pb-210 in lake Pavin in many ways resembles that in the ocean, only the time scales of the processes involved are faster.																			0009-2541					MAR 5	1992	94	3					173	181		10.1016/0168-9622(92)90010-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0168-9622(92)90010-8													WOS:A1992HK49300002

IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGES ON AGRORESOURCES OF UKRAINIAN POLISSIA BASED ON GEOSPATIAL DATA	AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE AND PRACTICE												Aim. To determine the patterns of the climate change impact on the transformation of agricultural production and the ecosystem of Ukrainian Polissia in terms of time and space. Methods. Satellite and statistical data for the last 40 years (1982-2022) were used. The mean temperature for the vegetation period was defined by the sum of radiation temperatures of the terrestrial surface, calculated using the data of the infrared range (10.3-11.3; 11.4-12.4 mu m) of the high- precision AVHRR radiometer of artificial meteorological Earth's satellites, NOAA, and the precipitation dynamics - using the data of ERA5 ECMWF/Copernicus Climate Change Service (https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/ datasets/catalog/ECMWF_ERA5_MONTHLY#description). The impact of climate change on the vegetation state and phenological parameters, including the beginning, end, and duration of the vegetation season, was determined by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), obtained using the data of the infrared (0.72-1.1 mu m) and red (0.58-0.68 mu m) ranges of the AVHRR radiometer on the website of STAR NESDIS NOAA - Satellite Applications and Research of NOAA's National Environmental Satellite Data Information Services of the USA - http://www.star. nesdis.noaa.gov/smcd/emb/vci/VH/. Crop yields and the dynamics of sown areas were determined by the data from the State Statistics Service of Ukraine. The information about the dynamics of the forest cover was obtained using the Global Forest Watch satellite data (https://www.globalforestwatch.org/map/country/UKR). To evaluate the impact of climate change on Ukraine's forests, the investigation was conducted on burnt forest areas, using the MCD64A1 6.1 index, developed on the basis of the MODIS satellite data (https://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MCD64A1.061). The additional identification of the burnt areas in the forest cover involved the use of the data from Hansen Global Forest Change v.1.11 (https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1244693). The results of the analysis yielded detailed information about the areas of burnt forests in different regions of Ukraine over an extended period. Results. According to the satellite data, the radiation temperature of the terrestrial surface (hereinafter - temperature) during the growing period increased by 2.2 degrees & Scy; on average in the territory of Ukrainian Polissia over the last 40 years. There is a regional difference in the temperature regime observed in the direction from west to east. In the territory of western Polissia, the increase in the temperature of the terrestrial surface in recent decades was within the range of 1.2-1.6, and in the central and eastern parts - within 2.3-2.9 degrees & Scy;. Due to the warming, the duration of the growing period was extended by 21-35 days, mostly because of earlier spring onset. There is a descending trend in the average annual precipitation amount down to 20-30 mm, which is especially notable for central and eastern Polissia. The warming was the reason for the introduction of the crops, new for this region, into the structure of sown areas, especially corn and sunfl ower, which had a generally positive effect on the vegetation state by the NDVI index, which increased from 0.30 in 1982-1992 to 0.36 in 2012-2022 on average. The crop yield increased accordingly, and according to the statistical data for the recent years, amounted to: corn - 7.0-9.5 t/ha, winter wheat - 4.5-5.0, and sunflower - 1.5-2.0 t/ha, which is close to the level of their yield on chornozem. At the same time, due to climate change and the transformation of agricultural activity, there has been a higher risk of deterioration in the ecological state of typical Polissia landscapes, droughts, and soil degradation. According to the results of the analysis of twenty-two years of the dynamics in forest fi res, the largest areas of burnt forests were registered in 2012 (694.30 sq.km), 2015 (1,078.81 sq.km), and 2020 (776.27 sq.km), which demonstrated the increase in fi res during the recent decade along with the tendency towards longer fi re hazard period. Prior to 2010, the largest areas of the burnt forests were registered in March, April, August, and September, and after 2010, the peaks were also seen in October. At the same time, there was a tendency towards the extension of the wetland areas, especially in the period of 2015-2017. However, their total area in the territory of Ukrainian Polissia is rather variable: there is both a gain and a loss in its area, which is especially notable for central Polissia. In this region, the increase in the area of wetlands has been 18.7 thousand ha in the recent 20 years, with the simultaneous vanishing of up to 14.6 thousand ha. Under the deterioration of hydrological conditions, the expansion of their area may have been associated with the impairment of the land reclamation network infrastructure, which led to the secondary swamping of the reclaimed territories. Conclusions. The increase in the temperature of the terrestrial surface of the Ukrainian Polissia during the growing period and the lengthening of the growing period created the conditions for corn and sunflower to be introduced into the arable areas, which had a positive impact on the vegetation state index, NDVI. As a result of these transformations both in the sown area of these crops and their yield, Polissia is becoming a new grain-oil belt of Ukraine. Concurrently, there are higher risks associated with maintaining high performance of agroecosystems and the increase in the risks for soil degradation processes, the deterioration of the ecological state of wetlands and forests, as well as drying-out of small rivers and lakes. Balancing the high yield of modern agroecosystems and safe nature management requires systemic measures in adapting the agricultural activity and nature management to new climatic conditions, which requires implementing the management of soil, water, and bio-resources, achieving optimal parameters of fertility for mineral and peaty-swampy soils. Reconstructing current land reclamation systems to optimize water regimes for the agricultural lands and protect typical Polissia ecosystem is needed.					; Andreiev, Artem/ABW-6118-2022; Cruse, Richard/AAD-2154-2020; Tarariko, Oleksandr/AAD-1976-2019; Kuchma, Tetyana/AAD-2037-2019; Kozlova, Anna/L-1500-2018; Ilienko, Tetiana/J-4227-2012	Yatsiuk, Mykhailo/0000-0002-5535-715X; Andreiev, Artem/0000-0002-6485-449X; Kuchma, Tetyana/0000-0002-9328-5919; Cruse, Richard/0000-0002-8995-3064; Kozlova, Anna/0000-0001-5336-237X; 													2312-3370	2312-3389					2024	11	2					3	29		10.15407/agrisp11.02.003	http://dx.doi.org/10.15407/agrisp11.02.003													WOS:001360821300001

Palynostratigraphy and lithostratigraphy of Carboniferous Upper Codroy Group and Barachois Group, southwestern Newfoundland	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												A new zone, the Reticulatisporites carnosus Assemblage Zone of late Pendleian to Arnsbergian age, is proposed for miospore assemblages in the Searston Formation of the Barachois Group and in unnamed coal-bearing strata in higher portions of the group. The beds containing the zone can be correlated with those in other parts of the Euramerican floral province in western Europe (including the North Sea), where the climate was semi-humid. Temporal relationships suggested by these new biostratigraphic data indicate that a reassessment of the regional lithostratigraphy of southwestern Newfoundland is required. The Overfall Brook Member of the Robinsons River Formation, formerly assigned with its correlative, the Brow Pond Lentil, to the Codroy Group, is here identified as a basal unit of the Searston Formation. It lies unconformably on Codroy Group beds of Brigantian age. Elsewhere, the basal beds of the Barachois Group lie unconformably on pre-Carboniferous rocks. The Barachois Group in the Codroy and St. George's Bay lowlands correlates with the Humber Falls and Howley formations of the Deer Lake Subbasin of western Newfoundland and with the Pomquet Formation of the Mabou Group, Nova Scotia. The Pendleian-Arnsbergian coal-bearing strata high in the undivided Barachois Group predate the post-Arnsbergian major floral crisis and, with their correlatives, represent the youngest known rock units of Mississippian age in Atlantic Canada. They are significantly older than the Pennsylvanian coal measures of Moscovian (Bolsovian) age in a small outlier near Stephenville, and we recommend the latter be removed from the Barachois Group.																			0008-4077					JAN	2008	45	1					45	67		10.1139/E07-066	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/E07-066													WOS:000253772700004

Characterization of the hydrodynamic behavior of Green Bay was a key step in the model calibration process. To accomplish this, the WASP4 finite-segment model framework was calibrated to describe chloride dynamics during an 18-month period (Jan 1989 to May 1990). Extensive use was made of field data (currents, water temperature, wind, and ice cover), and new interpretations of these data were developed. The direction of circulation in Green Bay typically reverses every three to five days during open water periods; these reversals are closely correlated to wind direction relative to the axis of the Bay. inflows from Lake Michigan exceed the combined inflows of all tributaries by over twenty times; the circulation of these inflows through Green Bay are greatly enhanced each spring when the ice cover melts. During open water periods, bulk dispersion coefficients typically range from 20 to 120 m(2)/s in the longitudinal direction, and from 5 to 40 m(2)/s in the transverse direction. The calibrated advection and dispersion fields accurately describe the major hydrodynamic features of Green Bay, and were incorporated into input data sets for models of eutrophication, organic carbon sorbents, and toxic chemicals.																			0380-1330						1995	21	4					599	609		10.1016/S0380-1330(95)71071-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(95)71071-1													WOS:A1995TP51700018

The Kulanaokuaiki-3 tephra, 900 CE: Products of a remarkably energetic pyroclastic eruption at Kilauea Volcano, Hawai'i, USA	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												Eruptions of Kilauea Volcano, Hawai'i, USA, can be more powerful than previously recognized. The Kulanaokuaiki-3 (K-3) eruption, ca. 900 CE, consisted of two episodes that dispersed lithic wall-rock clasts (Episode 1) and dominantly scoria (Episode 2; VEI-3) across >65 km(2) southeast of the summit Dense 12 cm blocks of Episode 1 fell 8-10 km from the summit vent, and 2-4 cm lithic lapilli reached the coastline, 17 km from the vent. The Episode 2 deposit is chemically zoned, indicating orderly eruption from a layered magma body analogous to the 1959 Kilauea Iki lava lake. Olivine-hosted melt inclusions suggest a magma body within 1 km of the surface. Some Episode 1 lithic clasts have magmatic rinds chemically similar to the early Episode 2 scoria, suggesting a genetic link, although each had a distinct eruption mechanism. Southeastward tephra dispersal counter to NE trade winds implies dispersal by jet-stream winds. The dispersal of lithic clasts in Episode 1 cannot be explained by ballistic trajectories or by transport in a buoyant plume. Calculations instead indicate that a jet from a vent with a minimum diameter of 50 m, a velocity of at least 300 m/s, and a duration of similar to 60 s could have lifted the lithic clasts into the jet stream. Isopach and isopleth maps for Episode 2 indicate a subplinian column height of 14-18 km and a duration of 2-3 h, assuming constant flux. The Episode 1 conduit probably intersected or otherwise lowered pressure within a compositionally zoned magma body, triggering eruption of the Episode 2 scoria.					; Nichols, Alex/T-1052-2019; Andrews, Ben/GRY-6201-2022	Rose, Timothy/0000-0002-8299-578X; Andrews, Benjamin/0000-0001-9928-1225; 													0016-7606	1943-2674				SEP-OCT	2019	131	9-10					1537	1554		10.1130/B35063.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/B35063.1													WOS:000483604100007

The abundance and interconnectivity of water beneath the Antarctic Ice Sheet, largely demonstrated through remote sensing techniques, indicates significant and varied SAE including lakes, saturated sediments and channelized and linked cavity drainage systems. Microbes have been detected in the two Antarctic SAE sampled to date; accreted ice from Vostok Subglacial Lake in East Antarctica and saturated till from beneath ice streams draining the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Heterotrophic activity has been measured in these samples at temperatures close to freezing in the laboratory, demonstrating that in situ microbial activity in subglacial environments is plausible. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences suggests that organisms with Fe and S oxidizing metabolisms may also be important members of the microbial community in these environments. This is consistent with the geochemistry of the accreted ice and till pore waters that indicates biologically driven sulfide oxidation coupled to carbonate and silicate mineral weathering as a significant solute source. Exploration of Antarctic SAE is in its infancy, and in a number of the unexplored SAE, the lack of connectivity between oxygenated surface waters and the subglacial environment and the extended water flow paths and water-rock residence times may lead to anoxic conditions. Such anoxic conditions would favor anaerobic microbial metabolisms similar to those documented in other deep terrestrial subsurface environments.

Here, we report a record of n-alkanes from the sediments of Shuanghu Lake in the Altai Mountains. In this forested region, the vegetation is dominated by C3 plants and the long-chain n-alkanes (C29-C31) in the lake sediments are predominantly derived from leaf wax lipids. The compound-specific carbon isotopic values of the long-chain n-alkanes are sensitive to regional moisture. Both the delta 13C29-31 value and the Paq index show a decreasing trend since ~9.0 kyr BP, implying an increase in moisture. This trend is punctuated by abrupt decreases in isotopic values centered at 8.2, 7.4, 5.6, 3.0, 2.0 and 0.2 kyr BP, which may indicate cold and wet events on decadal-centennial timescales. The Holocene hydrological patterns recorded at Shuanghu Lake are different from those from monsoonal Asia and they may reflect a response to decreasing Arctic sea ice cover that provided an enhanced moisture source and promoted increased heavy snowfall in the study region, or an increase in the temperature gradient and strength of the jet stream and extratropical cyclones at mid-latitudes, as proposed previously.					; Darin, Fedor/I-6472-2016; Su, Youliang/A-1751-2012; Wang, Shuxian/JFK-9669-2023; Darin, Andrey/O-3036-2013	Li, Qi/0000-0002-9876-6359; Darin, Andrey/0000-0001-5966-4838; 													1040-6182	1873-4553				JUL 10	2022	625						29	37		10.1016/j.quaint.2022.04.008	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2022.04.008		JUN 2022											WOS:000818781500003

Correlations of growth with climate were positive for water relations and mostly negative for summer temperatures. Growth was generally correlated across sites, with the central Nevada stands most distinct. Although growth was low during the Late Holocene Dry Period, variability marked this interval, suggesting that it was not pervasively dry. All sites had low growth during the first half of the Medieval Climate Anomaly, high growth during the mid-interval pluvial, and low growth subsequently. Little synchrony occurred across sites for the early Little Ice Age. After AD 1650, growth was depressed until the early twentieth century. Growth at all sites declined markedly ca. AD 1985, was similar to the lowest growth period of the full records, and indicative of recent severe droughts. A small rebound in growth occurred after ca. AD 2010. A strong signal for Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) occurred in growth response at most sites. The persistence of all stands despite climate variability indicates high resilience of this species.

J	Colón, YMS; Schaffner, FC				Sanchez Colon, Yashira Marie; Schaffner, Fred Charles			A Case Study of the Effects of Management Interventions on the Phosphorus Dynamics at a Coastal, Eutrophic, Caribbean lagoon (Laguna Cartagena, Puerto Rico)	WATER												Laguna Cartagena is a coastal, eutrophic, shallow lake and freshwater wetland in southwestern Puerto Rico, managed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service. This ecosystem has been impacted by phosphorus loading from adjacent agricultural areas since the 1950s, causing eutrophication and deteriorating wildlife habitats. Herein, we describe phosphorus input and export during September 2010-September 2011 (Phase One) and October 2013-November 2014 (Phase Two). These two phases bracket a period of intensified management interventions including excavation and removal of sediment and vegetation, draining, and burning during the summers of 2012 and 2013. Results indicate that Laguna Cartagena retains a phosphorus (sink) in its sediments, and exhibits nutrient-releasing events (source, mainly total phosphorus) to the lagoon water column, which are associated with rainfall and rising water levels. External factors including water level fluctuations and rainfall influenced phosphorus export during Phase One, but after management interventions (Phase Two), internal processes influenced sink/source dynamics, releasing elevated phosphorus concentrations to the water column. When exposed sediments were re-flooded, phosphorus concentrations to the water column increased, releasing elevated P concentrations downstream to an estuarine wetlands area and the Caribbean Sea. Herein we offer management recommendations to optimize wildlife habitat without elevating phosphorus concentrations.																				2073-4441				FEB	2021	13	4							449	10.3390/w13040449	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13040449													WOS:000624889600001

In this study we compare a detailed geochemical sediment record with (1) forest and land use history inferred from the first pollen and charcoal records from Lake Lehmilampi, and (2) existing archaeological surveys and independent proxy-records of climate change in the study region. The physical and geochemical sediment parameters examined include grain size analysis data and 23 chemical elements, determined with four selective extractions and ICP-MS. There are indications of possible human impact in the lake catchment as early as the Neolithic period, c. 3000-2550 bc, but the first undisputable signs are dated to 1800-100 bc. Cereal pollen reappears at c. ad 1700 and increases rapidly until c. ad 1950. The Holocene Thermal Maximum, its end c. 2000 bc, and the Medieval Climate Anomaly' were major climate events that had a prominent effect on erosion intensity, while human impact was a more significant factor during the period 3000 bc-ad 800 and from ad 1500 onwards. Although signs of changes in erosion intensity found in the sediment were small in this small catchment, they were significant enough to have a clear impact on the fraction of potentially mobile element species. This fraction increases with decreasing erosion intensity, which is probably related to a higher degree of chemical weathering and leaching during periods of decreased erosion.

J	Pitman, KJ; Smith, DJ				Pitman, Kara J.; Smith, Dan J.			Tree-ring derived Little Ice Age temperature trends from the central British Columbia Coast Mountains, Canada	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Most glaciers in the British Columbia Coast Mountains reached their maximum Holocene extent during the Little Ice Age. Early- and late-Little Ice Age intervals of expansion and retreat fluctuations describe a mass-balance response to changing climates. Although existing dendroclimatic records provide insights into these climatic fluctuations over the last 400 yr, their short durations prohibit evaluation of early-Little Ice Age climate variability. To extend the duration of these records, submerged coarse woody debris salvaged from a high-elevation lake was cross-dated to living chronologies. The resulting chronology provides the opportunity to reconstruct a regional June-July air-temperature anomaly record extending from AD 1225 to 2010. The reconstruction shows that the intervals AD 1350-1420.1475-1550,1625-1700 and 1830-1940 characterized distinct periods of below-average June-July temperature followed by periods of above-average temperature. Our reconstruction provides the first annually resolved insights into high-elevation climates spanning the Little Ice Age in this region and indicates that Little Ice Age moraine stabilization corresponds to persistent intervals of warmer-than-average temperatures. We conclude that coarse woody debris submerged in high-elevation lakes has considerable potential for developing lengthy proxy climate records, and we recommend that researchers focus attention on this largely ignored paleoclimatic archive.

Interpreted as a localised landslide-dammed lake, lithofacies analyses indicate deposition and preservation in a low energy, sub-aqueous, lacustrine environment. Robust Bayesian-derived age-depth models constrained by key tephra fall beds and independent C-14 dating (n = 7) indicate storm-bed frequency of c. 226 yrs on average. The absence of extensive soft-sediment deformation or lake-bed tilting implies that seismic shaking was insignificant during the Lake's c. 12 ka yr (17.3-5.5 cal ka BP) existence. Pollen spectra extracted from lacustrine deposits include a mix of montane shrubland and lowland podocarp species spanning a well-dated c. 2200-year (c. 16.3-14.1 cal ka BP) period coeval with a phase of significant climate amelioration (late NZCe-5/NZce-4 mild episode), based on biotic proxies during the latter part of the climatically variable Last Glacial-Interglacial Transition (LGIT) (c. 18.2-11.8 cal ka BP). These pollen spectra represent the first New Zealand record of replacement of montane shrublands in terrestrial uplands of the WSS were replaced by lowland podocarp forest.																			0028-8306	1175-8791				JAN 2	2022	65	1			SI		220	241		10.1080/00288306.2021.1947327	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288306.2021.1947327		JUL 2021											WOS:000675279200001

First published August 5, 2009; doi: 10.1152/ajpregu.00132.2009.-Heart rate variability (HRV) falls in humans with sepsis, but the mechanism is not well understood. We utilized a mouse model of endotoxemia to test the hypothesis that cytokines play a role in abnormal HRV during sepsis. Adult male C57BL/6 mice underwent surgical implantation of probes to continuously monitor electrocardiogram and temperature or blood pressure via radiotelemetry. Administration of high-dose LPS (Escherichia coli LPS, 10 mg/kg, n = 10) caused a biphasic response characterized by an early decrease in temperature and heart rate at 1 h in some mice, followed by a prolonged period of depressed HRV in all mice. Further studies showed that LPS doses as low as 0.01 mg/kg evoked a significant decrease in HRV. With high-dose LPS, the initial drops in temperature and HR were temporally correlated with peak expression of TNF alpha 1 h post-LPS, whereas maximal depression in HRV coincided with peak levels of multiple other cytokines 3-9 h post-LPS. Neither hypotension nor hypothermia explained the HRV response. Pretreatment with dexamethasone prior to LPS significantly blunted expression of 7 of the 10 cytokines studied and shortened the duration of depressed HRV by about half. Interestingly, dexamethasone treatment alone caused a dramatic increase in both low-and high-frequency HRV. Administration of recombinant TNF alpha caused a biphasic response in HR and HRV similar to that caused by LPS. Understanding the role of cytokines in abnormal HRV during sepsis could lead to improved strategies for detecting life-threatening nosocomial infections in intensive care unit patients.					; Moorman, J/ABG-9946-2020	Saucerman, Jeffrey/0000-0001-9464-8374; Fairchild, Karen/0000-0002-1081-8741													0363-6119	1522-1490				OCT	2009	297	4					R1019	R1027		10.1152/ajpregu.00132.2009	http://dx.doi.org/10.1152/ajpregu.00132.2009								19657103					WOS:000270184100012

Arctic regional methane fluxes by ecotope as derived using eddy covariance from a low-flying aircraft	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												The Arctic terrestrial and sub-sea permafrost region contains approximately 30% of the global carbon stock, and therefore understanding Arctic methane emissions and how they might change with a changing climate is important for quantifying the global methane budget and understanding its growth in the atmosphere. Here we present measurements from a new in situ flux observation system designed for use on a small, low-flying aircraft that was deployed over the North Slope of Alaska during August 2013. The system combines a small methane instrument based on integrated cavity output spectroscopy (ICOS) with an air turbulence probe to calculate methane fluxes based on eddy covariance. We group surface fluxes by land class using a map based on LandSat Thematic Mapper (TM) data with 30m resolution. We find that wet sedge areas dominate the methane fluxes with a mean flux of 2.1 mu gm(-2) s(-1) during the first part of August. Methane emissions from the Sagavanirktok River have the second highest at almost 1 mu gm(-2) s(-1). During the second half of August, after soil temperatures had cooled by 7 degrees C, methane emissions fell to between 0 and 0.5 mu gm(-2) s(-1) for all areas measured. We compare the aircraft measurements with an eddy covariance flux tower located in a wet sedge area and show that the two measurements agree quantitatively when the footprints of both overlap. However, fluxes from sedge vary at times by a factor of 2 or more even within a few kilometers of the tower demonstrating the importance of making regional measurements to map out methane emissions spatial heterogeneity. Aircraft measurements of surface flux can play an important role in bridging the gap between ground-based measurements and regional measurements from remote sensing instruments and models.

Fall diets of alewife, rainbow smelt, and slimy sculpin in the profundal zone of southern Lake Ontario during 1994-2005 with an emphasis on occurrence of Mysis relicta	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT					49th Annual Conference of the International-Association-for-Great-Lakes-Research	MAY 22-28, 2006	Univ Windsor, Windsor, CANADA	Int Assoc Great Lakers Res	Univ Windsor			In Lake Ontario, factors including the collapse of the burrowing amphipod, Diporeia spp., changes in the distribution and composition of the prey fish community, and occurrence of exotic cladocerans Bythotrephes longimanus and Cercopagis pengoi have led to changes in predation pressure on the remaining native profundal macroinvertebrate, Mysis relicta. We conducted a diet study on three important prey fishes, alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax), and slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus) in 2002-2005 at depths 75-130 m along the south shore of Lake Ontario to evaluate the current role of Mysis in the diets of these species relative to earlier studies and previously unpublished data from 1994-1995. Mysis have remained an important prey item for alewife, rainbow smelt, and slimy sculpin in the profundal zone of southern Lake Ontario through 2005, indicating that the population has been able to sustain itself following the collapse of Diporeia. Although the occurrence of Diporeia in prey fish diets was minimal in 2003-2005, Bythotrephes longimanus and Cercopagis pengoi played an important role in the diet of alewife and a minor role in the diet of rainbow smelt, and may actually serve to mitigate predation pressure on Mysis, particularly in years when they are very abundant. Conversely, without Diporeia, the benthic slimy sculpin was primarily reliant on Mysis as a prey item and would be most vulnerable to a decline in the Mysis population.																			1463-4988						2008	11	4					368	376	PII 906371372	10.1080/14634980802516128	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14634980802516128													WOS:000261413500003

Potential consequences of a Mid-Pleistocene impact event for the Middle Stone Age occupants of Dakhleh Oasis, Western Desert, Egypt	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL					Workshop on Hurricanes and Typhoons - From the Field Records to the Forecast	SEP 25-28, 2006	Gulf Coast Assoc Geol Soc, Lafayette, LA	United Nat Int Geosci Program, Int Geosphere Biosphere Programme Past Global Changes	Gulf Coast Assoc Geol Soc			While it is expected that prehistoric populations experienced the effects of impacts by extraterrestrial objects, there is little record of such events in occupied regions. We discuss the ramifications of an impact between 100 and 200 ka into Dakhleh Oasis, at that time experiencing humid phase conditions and inhabited by Middle Stone Age people. Based on modeling of impact processes using estimated impact parameters, the impact blast would likely have felled or dismembered most trees over 280-2400 kM(2) of the oasis, and inhabitants would have been injured over much of the region, although severely only near the blast location. The impact would not have vaporized much of the Dakhleh paleolake(s), although some water was probably lost through boiling and through waves initiated by the impact blast. Water quality would have decreased as lake turbidity increased, and soot from regional fires fell into the lake. A relatively small event would not have immediately ignited much of the oasis vegetation, but sedimentary evidence suggests that impact-generated fires did spread to significantly affect the landscape. The impact and resulting fires may have triggered mass wasting events as well as significant changes in erosion rates and have substantially affected human uses of the area.

The white sucker, a benthic consumer, was more heavily infected than the walleye, a pelagic piscivore, in both lakes. Infection levels increased significantly with host age and size. For both species, abundance of Diplostomum spp. within each age group and length class was higher in fish from Lake St. Louis than in those from Lake St. Pierre. Walleye of all ages and white suckers greater than or equal to7 years old from Lake St. Louis were also larger at age than those of corresponding age from Lake St. Pierre. Therefore, walleye and white suckers from Lake St. Louis are probably different populations from those in Lake St. Pierre. The higher infection levels in Lake St. Louis are most likely due to the larger number of ring-billed gulls (Larus delawarensis), an important definitive host of Diplostomum spp., in colonies in close proximity to that lake; there are > 75 000 pairs within 40 km of Lake St. Louis and 16 000 pairs within 40 km of Lake St. Pierre. No detrimental effects of infection with Diplostomum spp. could be detected on fish fork length, body mass, condition index, or gonadosomatic index. Walleye from shallow lentic waters in Lake St. Louis were larger and possessed heavier infections of Diplostomum spp. than those from deeper lotic waters. Walleye collected from a fixed trap near Quebec City in July 1997 were smaller but more heavily infected with Diplostomum spp. than those collected in October, which implies that different populations of fish may be present seasonally at this location. A visual index developed to measure the degree of opacity of the lens of fishes does not appear to be a reliable indicator of levels of infection with eye flukes. Experimental infection of laboratory-raised juvenile ring-billed gulls with metacercariae from the lenses of various fish species collected in the St. Lawrence River demonstrated that metacercariae were primarily Diplostomum indistinctum (84-92%), the remainder being Diplostomum huronense, and this pattern is consistent across host species and localities.

In order to clarify the aeolian environments that influence the development of long-ridge yardangs in the northwestern Qaidam Basin of China, the present research investigated the winds by installing wind observation tower in the field. We found that the sand-driving winds mainly blow from the north-northwest, northwest and north, and occur the most frequent in summer, because the high temperature increases atmospheric instability and leads to downward momentum transfer and active local convection during these months. The annual drift potential and the ratio of resultant drift potential indicate that the study area pertains to a high-energy wind environment and a narrow unimodal wind regime. The wind energy decreases from northwest to southeast in the Qaidam Basin, with the northerly winds in the northwestern basin changing to more westerly in the southeastern basin. The strong and unidirectional wind regime for the long-ridge yardangs in the northwestern Qaidam Basin results from the combined effects of topographic obstacles such as the Altun Mountains and of the interaction between the air stream and the yardang bodies. Present study suggests that yardang evolution needs such strong and unidirectional winds in high-or intermediate-energy wind environments. This differs from sandy deserts or sandy lands, which usually develop at low-or intermediate-energy wind environments. Present study clarifies the wind regime corresponding to the long-ridge yardangs' development, and lays firm foundation to put forward the formation mechanisms for yardangs in the Qaidam Basin.																			1674-6767	2194-7783				OCT	2019	11	5					701	712		10.1007/s40333-019-0108-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40333-019-0108-4													WOS:000507479000006
B	Burn, CR		Migon, P		Burn, Christopher R.			The Mackenzie Delta: An Archetypal Permafrost Landscape	GEOMORPHOLOGICAL LANDSCAPES OF THE WORLD												The Mackenzie Delta, in Canada's western Arctic, is North America's largest arctic delta. For over half the year the rivers and lakes of this vast alluvial plain are ice covered. Permafrost is ubiquitous in the delta and the surrounding landscape. Tree line traverses the delta, separating closed-canopy white spruce forests in southern parts from low shrub tundra and sedge wetlands at the Beaufort Sea coast. The extension of the delta northwards into the ocean is the net result of 128 Mt of sediment brought annually to the delta by Mackenzie and Peel Rivers, of which about two thirds are deposited offshore. The permafrost of the uplands adjacent to the delta is ice-rich, with numerous tabular bodies of almost pure ice that formed when the ground originally froze. Throughout the region the terrain surface is criss-crossed by networks of ice-wedge polygons, formed by water freezing in cracks opened by ground contraction during winter cooling. The world's largest population of pingos - ice-cored, conical hills up to 50 m high has developed in the sandy sediments of drained lakes in the area. These features form as permafrost aggrades in saturated lake sediments, and continual uplift of these little hills demonstrates the enormous forces that can be generated by ground freezing.																					978-90-481-3054-2				2010							1	12		10.1007/978-90-481-3055-9_1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-90-481-3055-9_1	10.1007/978-90-481-3055-9												WOS:000278086500001

By investigating the distribution of modern pollen taxa on the east Tibetan Plateau, we infer the past vegetation and climate since 14.2 ka BP (1000 years before present) from a fossil pollen record extracted from Gahai Lake (102.3133 degrees E, 34.2398 degrees N; 3444ma.s.l.) together with multiple proxies (grain size, contents of total organic carbon and total nitrogen) on the northeast Tibetan Plateau. Results indicate that the Gahai Basin was covered by arid alpine steppe or even desert between 14.2 and 7.4 ka BP with dry climatic conditions, and high percentages of arboreal pollen are thought to be long-distance wind- transported grains. Montane forest (dominated by Abies, Picea, and Pinus) migrated into the Gahai Basin between 7.4 and 3.8 ka BP driven by wet and warm climatic conditions (the climate optimum within the Holocene) but reverted to alpine steppe between 3.8 and 2.3 ka BP, indicating a drying climate trend. After 2.3 ka BP, vegetation shifted to alpine meadow represented by increasing abundances of Cyperaceae, which may reflect a cooling climate. The strange pollen spectra with high abundances of Cyperaceae and high total pollen concentrations after ca. 0.24 ka BP (1710 CE) could be an indication of disturbance by human activities to some extent, but needs more direct evidence to be confirmed. Our study confirms the occurrence of a climate optimum in the mid-Holocene on the northeast Tibetan Plateau, which is consistent with climate records from the fringe areas of the East Asian summer monsoon, and provides new insights into the fluctuations in the intensity and extent of the Asian monsoon system.					; hou, xiaohuan/HJB-1484-2022; Cao, Xianyong/L-7168-2019	Cao, Xianyong/0000-0001-5633-2256; 													1814-9324	1814-9332				OCT 25	2022	18	10					2381	2399		10.5194/cp-18-2381-2022	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-18-2381-2022													WOS:000871566700001

The Tasuj plain is one of the 12 marginal plains around Urmia Lake which is currently under a critical ecological condition. In the last decades, the Tasuj plain aquifer suffered from severe groundwater level declination and caused degradation of groundwater quality. To better understand hydrogeochemical processes in the Tasuj plain, this study adopted graphical methods and multivariate statistical techniques to analyze groundwater samples. A total of 504 groundwater samples was obtained from 34 different locations (qanats, wells, and springs) over 12 years (1997-2009) and analyzed for 15 water quality parameters. From the results, the Piper diagram indicated four groundwater types and the Stiff diagram showed eight different sources of groundwater samples. The Durov diagram identified five major hydrogeochemical processes in the aquifer. However, hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) identified five water types in the groundwater samples because HCA was able to analyze more chemical and physical data than graphical methods. The HCA result was checked by discriminant analysis and found consistency in all samples that were classified into correct groups. Using factor analysis, we identified three factors that accounted for 81.6% of the total variance of the dataset. Based on the high factor loadings of the variables, factors 1 and 2 reflected the natural hydrogeochemical processes and factor 3 explained the effect of agricultural fertilizers and human activities in the Tasuj plain. Dendrograms from 2000 to 2009 were studied to understand the temporal variation of groundwater quality. Comparing the distributions of groundwater types in 2000 and 2009, we found that the mixing zone was expanded. This may be due to artificial groundwater recharge in the recharge area and the effect of inverse ion exchange in the discharge area.					; Nadiri, Ataallah/H-3740-2019; Fijani, Elham/L-4496-2019	Tsai, Frank/0000-0002-8005-5575; Nadiri, Ata Allah/0000-0001-9211-0546; Fijani, Elham/0000-0001-9390-0849; 													2347-4327	0973-774X				AUG	2013	122	4					1091	1105		10.1007/s12040-013-0329-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12040-013-0329-4													WOS:000323666100016

Effectiveness of Litter Removal to Prevent Cambial Kill-Caused Mortality in Northern Arizona Ponderosa Pine	FOREST SCIENCE												Removal of deep litter and duff from the base of mature southwestern ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws.) is commonly recommended to reduce mortality after prescribed burns, but experimental studies that quantify the effectiveness of such practices in reducing mortality are lacking. After a pilot study on each of four sites in northern Arizona, we monitored 15-16 sets of 8 matched trees on areas designated to be burned and adjacent not-burned sites and randomly assigned one of four litter and duff removal (to mineral soil) treatments: (1) rake to a distance of 23 cm from the bole, (2) leaf blow to a distance of 23 cm, (3) rake to a distance of 1 m, and (4) no litter or duff disturbance or removal. By 3 years postburn, no trees had died because of any of the treatments, but litter and duff removal prevented most cambial kill. However, 17% of the burned, no removal trees had some cambial kill. Litter and duff removal to 23 cm was as effective in preventing cambial kill and bole char as removal to 1 m, and there was no difference between removal by raking versus leaf blower removal. These results suggest that litter and duff removal is not needed to prevent ponderosa pine mortality after fall prescribed burns, but removal to 23 cm is adequate to prevent spots of cambial kill or moderate bark char.

However, the published record is poorly resolved or contradictory for the period encompassing the terminal Pleistocene (22,000 to 11,600 cal BP) and early Holocene (11,600-8200 cal BP). This has resulted in conflicting interpretations about the timing of lacustrine high stands within the intermediate basin of China Lake, which harbors one of the most extensive records of early human occupation in the western Great Basin and California. Here, we report a broad range of radiocarbon-dated paleoenvironmental evidence, including lacustrine deposits and shoreline features, tufa outcrops, and mollusk, ostracode, and fish bone assemblages, as well as spring and other groundwater-related deposits (a.k.a. "black mats") from throughout China Lake basin, its outlet, and inflow drainages. Based on 98 radiocarbon dates, we develop independent evidence for five significant lake-level oscillations between 18,000 and 13,000 cal BP, and document the persistence of groundwater-fed wetlands from the beginning of the Younger Dryas through the early Holocene (12,900-8200 cal BP); including the transition from ground-water fed lake to freshwater marsh between about 13,000 and 12,600 cal BP. Results of this study support and refine existing evidence that shows rapid, high-amplitude oscillations in the water balance of the Owens River system during the terminal Pleistocene, and suggest widespread human use of China Lake basin began during the Younger Dryas.

Impact of Eurasian Ice Sheet and North Atlantic Climate Dynamics on Black Sea Temperature Variability During the Penultimate Glacial (MIS 6, 130-184 ka BP)	PALEOCEANOGRAPHY AND PALEOCLIMATOLOGY												Understanding hemisphere-wide millennial-scale temperature variability during past glacials in response to ice sheet dynamics and orbital forcing is one of the key targets for Quaternary climate research. While an inland propagation of abrupt temperature changes into Eurasia from the North Atlantic realm during the last glacial (Weichselian) receives increasingly broad support, much less is known regarding the penultimate glacial (Saalian) temperature variability, especially from a continental interior perspective. Here, we present a TEX86-derived lake surface temperature (LST) record from the former Black Sea "Lake" covering nearly the entire Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 6. While orbital-scale LST cooling likely relates to meltwater discharge from the retreating Eurasian Ice Sheet during insolation maxima, millennial-scale LST variability suggests interstadial warming in phase with Greenland and northern Mediterranean Sea temperature records during the first half of MIS 6. Although summer insolation reached an interglacial-like level during this period, we propose that the reduced extent of the Eurasian Ice Sheet associated with northward shifted atmospheric fronts was ultimately responsible for the inland propagation of Dansgaard-Oeschger-like temperature variability. During the second half of MIS 6, temperature patterns across the North Atlantic-Eurasian corridor were more variable and less comparable with each other, likely because of the larger continental ice sheet weakening northern hemisphere atmospheric teleconnections. Temperature records across the North Atlantic-Eurasian realm suggest a weaker atmospheric teleconnection during MIS 6 compared to MIS 3, likely related to a stronger imprint of the Eurasian Ice Sheet on the continental and regional climate.					; Arz, Helge/A-6659-2013	Kaiser, Jerome/0000-0002-0290-9088; Dellwig, Olaf/0000-0002-0028-8812; Wegwerth, Antje/0000-0002-5104-9408; Arz, Helge Wolfgang/0000-0002-1997-1718													2572-4517	2572-4525				AUG	2020	35	8							e2020PA003882	10.1029/2020PA003882	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020PA003882													WOS:000567508700003

Imprecise or inadequate knowledge of the ecological state increases the risk of misclassification and of wrong management decisions. Based on Danish lake data, we aimed to determine temporal variations, in particular natural year-to-year differences, and to describe the uncertainty in assessing the ecological state of lakes. We analysed environmental data from ca. 350 Danish lakes (1100 lake years), including three case studies, with long-term data series (up to 24 years), with no significant changes in external nutrient loading. We used summer means of selected water chemical variables, phytoplankton and submerged macrophytes as indicators of ecological state and found considerable variations in all indicators, which could not be ascribed alone to meteorological variation. In shallow lakes, chlorophyll a concentrations exhibited large year-to-year variations, especially at TP ranging between 0.05 and 0.15 mg L-1 where the lakes may shift between a macrophyte- and a phytoplankton-dominated state. For example, chlorophyll a varied by a factor 5-10 between years and was particularly low when submerged macrophyte coverage exceeded 20% compared with lakes without macrophytes. Use of a multimetric index including four phytoplankton indicators reduced the coefficient of variation. Generally, the 95% confidence interval of ecological classification was approximately 50% lower when the assessment of ecological state was based on 4-5 years' measurements than if based on only one year's measurements. Knowledge and awareness of the uncertainty of indicators used in ecological classification are highly relevant for lake managers and policy makers when defining efficient monitoring and restoration strategies.

The principal objective was to obtain a reliable lithostratigraphy of the playa sediments. These are about 7 m thick in the Bap-Malar and > 2.5 to 3 m thick in the Kanod. AMS C-14 dates of > 15 ka BP on pollen from sediment layers indicates that the Bap-Malar playa possibly existed even during the LGM. These playas were full of water during the early Holocene (8 ka BP - 5.5 ka BP) and were ephemeral during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition and early to mid to late Holocene. The playas dried almost 1000 years earlier than those occurring on the eastern margin. Pollen of graminaceae, chenopodiaceae/amaranthaceae, cyperaceae etc. and evaporite minerals like gypsum, halite in the profiles indicate that the playas were surrounded by vegetation dominated by grass and that, they remained brackish to saline even during the mid Holocene, lake full stage. Stable dune surfaces, pediments with regoliths, and gravelly channels of ephemeral streams provided a favorable geomorphic niche for nomadic human activity since similar to 7 ka BP. Though local ecological factors have played an important role in the evolution of the playas, the winter rains, connected with northwesterly depressions, most likely played a vital role in maintaining these playas.																			0253-4126					SEP	2004	113	3					403	425																WOS:000224423700010

Dynamics of the stream-lake transitional zone affect littoral lake metabolism	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Lake ecosystems, as integrators of watershed and climate stressors, are sentinels of change. However, there is an inherent time-lag between stressors and whole-lake response. Aquatic metabolism, including gross primary production (GPP) and respiration (R), of stream-lake transitional zones may bridge the time-lag of lake response to allochthonous inputs. In this study, we used high-frequency dissolved oxygen data and inverse modeling to estimate daily rates of summer epilimnetic GPP and R in a nutrient-limited oligotrophic lake at two littoral sites located near different major inflows and at a pelagic site. We examined the relative importance of stream variables in comparison to meteorological and in-lake predictors of GPP and R. One of the inflow streams was substantially warmer than the other and primarily entered the lake's epilimnion, whereas the colder stream primarily mixed into the metalimnion or hypolimnion. Maximum GPP and R rates were 0.2-2.5 mg O-2 L-1 day(-1) (9-670%) higher at littoral sites than the pelagic site. Ensemble machine learning analyses revealed that > 30% of variability in daily littoral zone GPP and R was attributable to stream depth and stream-lake transitional zone mixing metrics. The warm-stream inflow likely stimulated littoral GPP and R, while the cold-stream inflow only stimulated littoral zone GPP and R when mixing with the epilimnion. The higher GPP and R observed near inflows in our study may provide a sentinel-of-the-sentinel signal, bridging the time-lag between stream inputs and in-lake processing, enabling an earlier indication of whole-lake response to upstream stressors.					; Paerl, Hans/ABE-7384-2020; Carey, Cayelan/D-4874-2016	Weathers, Kathleen/0000-0002-3575-6508; Ward, Nicole Kristine/0000-0001-7549-0153; Richardson, David/0000-0001-9374-9624; Hanson, Paul/0000-0001-8533-6061													1015-1621	1420-9055				JUL	2022	84	3							31	10.1007/s00027-022-00854-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-022-00854-7													WOS:000788301800001
J	Foreman, CM; Wolf, CF; Priscu, JC				Foreman, CM; Wolf, CF; Priscu, JC			Impact of episodic warming events on the physical, chemical and biological relationships of lakes in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica	AQUATIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Lakes in the Taylor Valley, Antarctica were investigated to determine the impact of a significant air temperature warming event that occurred during the austral summer of 2001 - 2002. The warming in the valleys caused an increase in glacial run-off, record stream discharge, an increase in lake levels, and thinning of the permanent ice covers. These changes in the physical environment drove subsequent changes in the biogeochemistry of the lakes. Primary production in West Lake Bonney during the flood was reduced 23% as a consequence of stream induced water column turbidity. Increased nutrient levels within the lakes occurred in the year following the temperature induced high flow year. For example, soluble reactive phosphorus loading to Lake Fryxell was four-fold greater than the long-term average loading rates. These high nutrient levels corresponded to an increase in primary production in the upper water columns of Lakes Bonney and Fryxell. Depth integrated chlorophyll-a values increased 149% in East Lake Bonney, 48% in West Lake Bonney, and showed little change in Lake Fryxell; chlorophyll-a in Lake Hoare decreased 18% compared to long-term averages recorded as part of our ten year monitoring program, presumably from a reduction in under-ice PAR caused by increased sediment loads on the ice cover. Overall the warming event served to "recharge'' the ecosystem with liquid water and associated nutrients. Such "floods'' may play an important role in the long-term maintenance of liquid water in these dry valley lakes.

The Spokane Flood debates: historical background and philosophical perspective	HISTORY OF GEOMORPHOLOGY AND QUATERNARY GEOLOGY	Geological Society Special Publication											The 1920s-1930s debates over the origin of the 'Channeled Scabland' landscape of eastern Washington, northwestern USA, focused on the cataclysmic flooding hypothesis of J Harlen Bretz. During the summer of 1922, Bretz began leading field parties of advanced University of Chicago students into the region. In his first paper, published in the Bulletin of the Geological Society of America, Bretz took special care not to mention cataclysmic origins. However, in a subsequent paper in the Journal of Geology, to the editorial board of which he had recently been added, Bretz formally described his hypothesis that an immense late Pleistocene flood, which he named the 'Spokane Flood', had derived from the margins of the nearby Cordilleran Ice Sheet. This cataclysm neatly accounted for numerous interrelated aspects of the Channeled Scabland landscape and nearby regions. Nevertheless, the geological community largely resisted Bretz's hypothesis for decades, despite his enthusiastic and eloquent defence thereof. Resolution of the controversy came gradually, initially through the recognition by J. T. Pardee of a plausible source for the flooding: ice-dammed Pleistocene glacial Lake Missoula in northern Idaho and western Montana. Eventually, by the 1960s, the field evidence for cataclysmic flooding became overwhelming, and physical processes were found to be completely consistent with that evidence. The controversy is of philosophical interest in regard to its documentation of the attitudes of geologists toward hypotheses, which illustrate aspects of geological reasoning that are distinctive in degree from those of other sciences.																			0305-8719		978-1-86239-255-7				2008	301						33	50		10.1144/SP301.3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1144/SP301.3													WOS:000267243000004

Transport and mixing observed in a pond: Description of wind-forced transport processes and quantification of mixing rates	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Ponds are characterized by high biodiversity, intense biogeochemical cycling, and susceptibility to anthropogenic impacts. Yet few studies have quantified the water velocities responsible for vertical mixing or lateral transport in ponds. We used high-resolution observations of velocity to examine mixing and transport during summer in a 50-m-long, 2.7-m-deep temperate pond. Many observed transport and mixing processes resembled those found in larger stratified lakes. A surface mixed layer was observed, whose depth ranged between similar to 1 m at night and < 0.3 m during the day. Turbulence was usually sufficient to vertically mix the surface layer in 4-12 min, but no turbulence was observed in the hypolimnion. Persistent (2.5-h-averaged) currents usually flowed downwind near the surface and returned upwind near the mixed layer base. Surface currents were proportional to windspeed, with root-mean-squared speed of 8 x 10(-3) ms(-1) (persistent hypolimnion currents were much weaker). Superposed on persistent currents were 30- to 100-min-period fluctuations resulting from internal seiches. These fluctuations were comparable in magnitude to more persistent currents in the mixed layer and dominated in the hypolimnion. Seiches did not advect particles far across the pond, but did contribute to production of mixed layer turbulence. Seiches also contributed to shear dispersion, which was sufficient to mix near-surface tracers across the pond in 2-4 d. Theory suggests that hypolimnion bottom boundary layers were laminar during the downslope phase of seiche motion, but became turbulent during the upslope phase as near-bed water flows created unstable stratification.					; Goldberg, Caren/B-4075-2015	Nielson, Jeffrey/0000-0002-3327-5575; Henderson, Stephen M/0000-0001-9111-7885; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				SEP	2024	69	9					2180	2192		10.1002/lno.12658	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.12658		AUG 2024											WOS:001297053000001

The Effects of Lake Representation on the Regional Hydroclimate in the ECMWF Reanalyses	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												Lakes are an integral part of the geosphere, but they are challenging to represent in Earth system models, which either exclude lakes or prescribe properties without simulating lake dynamics. In the ECMWF interim reanalysis (ERA-Interim), lakes are represented by prescribing lake surface water temperatures (LSWT) from external data sources, while the newer-generation ERAS introduces the Freshwater Lake (FLake) parameterization scheme to the modeling system with different LSWT assimilation data sources. This study assesses the performance of these two reanalyses over three regions with the largest lakes in the world (Laurentian Great Lakes, African Great Lakes, and Lake Baikal) to understand the effects of their simulation differences on hydrometeorological variables. We find that differences in lake representation alter the associated hydrological and atmospheric processes and can affect regional hydroclimatic assessments. There are prominent differences in LSWT between the two datasets that influence the simulation of lake-effect snowstorms in the Laurentian winters and lake-land-breeze circulation patterns in the African region. Generally, ERAS has warmer LSWT in all three regions for most months (by 2-12 K) and its evaporation rates are up to twice the magnitudes in ERA-Interim. In the Laurentian lakes, ERAS has strong biases in LSWT and evaporation magnitudes. Over Lake Baikal and the African Great Lakes, ERAS LSWT magnitudes are closer to satellite-based datasets, albeit with a warm bias (1-4K), while ERA-Interim underestimates the magnitudes. ERAS also simulates intense precipitation hot spots in lake proximity that are not visible in ERA-Interim and other observation-based datasets. Despite these limitations, ERAS improves the simulation of lake-land circulation patterns across the African Great Lakes.					; Steiner, Allison/F-4942-2011; Steiner, Allison/AAC-7029-2020	Minallah, Samar/0000-0001-8419-5850; Steiner, Allison/0000-0002-3823-1512; 													0027-0644	1520-0493				JUN	2021	149	6					1747	1766		10.1175/MWR-D-20-0421.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/MWR-D-20-0421.1													WOS:000747034600007

Use of remotely sensed data to estimate the flow of water to a playa lake	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The presence of water on Rosamond lake presents potential operational hazards and environmental issues for Edwards Air Force Base (EAFB). This research tests the utility of threshold precipitation in predicting inundation of Rosamond lake. Arcview v.3.2, with the ESRI extension 'watershed delineator' and detailed field investigations were used to delineate the watershed and determine elevation-bounded intervals based on soil types and vegetation types and densities. The natural resource conservation service curve number approach was used to estimate the initial abstraction of precipitation, infiltration, runoff, and estimate the threshold depth of precipitation. Climatic data from the western regional climate center and remotely sensed data from the USA Army Corps of Engineers Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory were used to examine the association between winter precipitation events and surface water inundation. Visual-Data, a remote sensing analysis program, was used to analyze the Landsat multispectral images in the infrared (IR) bands and apply remote sensing techniques to determine the areal change of water on Rosamond lake over a defined temporal resolution. Threshold precipitation was then compared to precipitation events that occurred within the temporal resolution of the image subtractions to determine the association between precipitation and the inundation of Rosamond lake. The results of this study demonstrated that with refinement this approach could be used to predict the flow of water to a playa lake to predict the duration of inundation. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The sediments consist of sandy silts at the bottom, followed (in upward succession) by gyttja characterized by increasing CaCO3 content. The measured delta O-18 values oscillate from -9.3 to -5 parts per thousand and delta C-13 from - 5.7 to +0.4 parts per thousand. We identify 24 taxa of subfossil Cladocera and six phases (CAZ) of faunal development. Isotopic and cladoceran data together with detrended correspondence analyses (DCA) allow reconstruction of the environmental conditions, particularly changes in water level, temperature, and trophic status, during the Late Glacial and early Holocene. The lowest water temperature, connected with the inflow of cold melt water, occurred in the Late Glacial and Preboreal period. Since the Boreal period, gradual warming is observed and expressed through a positive trend in both delta O-18 and delta C-13 values and changes in Cladocera species assemblages. The lake was deepest at the beginning of the Holocene as a result of dead ice melting (supply of melt water; lowering of lake bottom) and/or precipitation increase (change in atmospheric circulation). During the Boreal period, the fall in water level takes place despite the opposite trend observed at nearby sites. In addition, the cladoceran data indicate an initial decrease in trophic conditions from alpha-mesotrophic to oligotrophic and then an increase to the beta-mesotrophic state.

J	Lovvorn, JR; Crozier, ML				Lovvorn, James R.; Crozier, Michelle L.			Duck Use of Saline Wetlands Created by Irrigation in a Semiarid Landscape	WETLANDS												Throughout semiarid western North America, flood irrigation and associated small reservoirs have created or augmented many wetlands that otherwise would not exist or persist through summer. Diversion of mountain snowmelt from rivers has thereby created widely scattered hotspots of biodiversity. Increased urban water demands, higher profits from sprinkler irrigation, and climate-driven declines in mountain snowpack threaten these wetlands. Knowledge of unique functions of different wetland types and their spatial interactions would aid conservation of wetland complexes. We characterized use by ducks of wetlands with varying salinities, vegetation, nearby land use, and spatial relations in the Laramie Basin, Wyoming, USA. All duck species and social groups had higher densities in smaller wetlands. Pairs and broods of diving ducks and some dabbling ducks had highest densities in oligosaline wetlands (0.5-5 parts per thousand salinity) which have emergent plants for nesting cover. However, these ducks were commonly observed in mesosaline wetlands (5-18 parts per thousand) which lack emergent cover but have higher availability of near-surface foods, suggesting differential use of wetland types for nesting and feeding. Accordingly, densities of some dabbling and diving ducks were higher when mesosaline wetlands were within 1 km. Hayfields or livestock grazing nearby seldom affected duck densities in wetlands, suggesting that with sparse upland cover in shortgrass steppe, many upland nesters sought cover in dry portions of the emergent fringe. For ducks in such intermountain basins, mesosaline wetlands with less stable water levels but high prey availability should be maintained in complexes near oligosaline wetlands with variably flooded emergent cover.																			0277-5212	1943-6246				JAN	2022	42	1							4	10.1007/s13157-021-01525-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-021-01525-3													WOS:000740233400002

Zoological Studies 50(1): 76-84. We carried out limnological investigations in relation to anticipated effects of migratory waterbird use in an urban lake 20 km from the East Calcutta Wetlands, a Ramsar site. Twenty-two species of birds used the lake during the migration and wintering periods (Oct.-Mar.) in 3 successive years (2004-2007). The lowest Shannon diversity index value of 0.360 was found in Nov., while the highest of 0.963 was found in Oct. for the pooled data collected during the 3-yr study period. We examined correlations among 17 physical, chemical, and vegetal factors with avian densities. The addition of bird guano increased the nutrients and was rapidly utilized by higher gross primary productivity (GPP) as well as by secondary production of the lake body. Higher rates of both primary and secondary production resulted in the rapid uptake of basic nutrients like phosphate, nitrate, and silicate. We found negative correlations of major nutrients (phosphate, nitrate, and silicate) with both GPP and higher avian densities. Increased areas of open water, which were free of floating vegetation, also likely influenced bird aggregation and the limnochemistry by allowing more space for avian interactions and increased solar input for photosynthesis, respectively. http://zoolstud.sinica.edu.tw/Journals/50.1/76.pdf																			1021-5506	1810-522X				JAN	2011	50	1					76	84																WOS:000286538700009

The Alqueva reservoir, the largest artificial lake in western Europe, located on the south-east of Portugal, was filled in 2004. It is a large natural laboratory that allows the study of changes in surface and in landscape and how they affect the weather in the region. This paper is focused on a 3-day case study, 22-24 July 2014, during which an intensive observation campaign was carried out. In order to quantify the breeze effects induced by the Alqueva reservoir, two simulations with the mesoscale atmospheric model Meso-NH coupled to the FLake freshwater lake model has been performed. The difference between the two simulations lies in the presence or absence of the reservoir on the model surface. Comparing the two simulation datasets, with and without the reservoir, net results of the lake impact were obtained. Magnitude of the impact on air temperature, relative humidity, and other atmospheric variables are shown. The clear effect of a lake breeze (5-7 m s(-1)) can be observed during daytime on distances up to 6 km away from the shores and up to 300 m above the surface. The lake breeze system starts to form at 09:00 UTC and dissipates at 18:0019:00 UTC with the arrival of a larger-scale Atlantic breeze. The descending branch of the lake breeze circulation brings dry air from higher atmospheric layers (2-2.5 km) and redistributes it over the lake. It is also shown that despite its significant intensity the effect is limited to a couple of kilometres away from the lake borders.					; Salgado, Rui/B-7588-2011	Potes, Miguel/0000-0002-8912-5277; Iakunin, Maksim/0000-0002-8272-2626; Salgado, Rui/0000-0003-1311-6291													1027-5606	1607-7938				OCT 5	2018	22	10					5191	5210		10.5194/hess-22-5191-2018	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-5191-2018													WOS:000446781900001
J	JACKSON, GA; LOCHMANN, SE				JACKSON, GA; LOCHMANN, SE			EFFECT OF COAGULATION ON NUTRIENT AND LIGHT LIMITATION OF AN ALGAL BLOOM	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Coagulation is the formation of large particles from multiple collisions of smaller ones. Because larger particles fall faster than smaller ones, coagulation can be important in accelerating the export of organic matter from the ocean's surface to the deep sea and has the potential to limit phytoplankton populations. We have developed a model of an algal bloom that includes nutrient and light limitation of algal growth rate and coagulation of single algal cells. The results show two effects of coagulation on the growth model. Loss of dividing cells to coagulating particles can occur when algal cells are growing at a fairly constant rate, placing a cap on the concentrations that algae can achieve. The second effect is enhancement of vertical particle flux from the surface mixed layer in aggregates. This enhanced transport moves algal biomass from the surface mixed layer over shorter periods at rates far greater than those associated with settling of single cells. For example, half the material associated with a bloom of 2-mu-m-radius algae, which would take 350 d to settle out as isolated cells, took 42 d as aggregates. Aggregation was not limited to the large algae, although the rate was slower for the smaller ones. Coagulation was enhanced by higher initial nutrient concentrations, deeper mixed layers, and higher shear rates. Vertical transport associated with aggregation has the potential to be an important mechanism for removing biological material from eutrophic regions.																			0024-3590					JAN	1992	37	1					77	89		10.4319/lo.1992.37.1.0077	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1992.37.1.0077													WOS:A1992HV29500007

Leaf primordia were initiated further from the apex in shoots grown under a pressure of 2.3 atm but the site of initiation is not critical for the subsequent growth of leaves in H. vulgaris. Lacunae in shoots grown under a pressure of 2.3 atm were also larger than those in control shoots, implying that pressure does not constrict air spaces. Root growth was not inhibited by a pressure of 2.3 atm. In warm water, PAR was apparently the environomental factor most likely to control the depth limits of H. vulgaris in the field.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1980	10	6					545	+		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1980.tb01230.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1980.tb01230.x													WOS:A1980KT41800008

N.; Moskalenko, Nataliya; Brown, Jerry; Walker, Donald A.; Raynolds, Martha K.; Buchhorn, Marcel			Degradation and stabilization of ice wedges: Implications for assessing risk of thermokarst in northern Alaska	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Widespread degradation of ice wedges has been observed during the last decades in numerous areas within the continuous permafrost zone of Eurasia and North America. To study ice-wedge degradation, we performed field investigations at Prudhoe Bay and Barrow in northern Alaska during 2011-2016. In each study area, a 250-m transect was established with plots representing different stages of ice-wedge degradation/stabilization. Field work included surveying ground- and water-surface elevations, thaw-depth measurements, permafrost coring, vegetation sampling, and ground-based LiDAR scanning. We described cryostratigraphy of frozen soils and stable isotope composition, analyzed environmental characteristics associated with ice-wedge degradation and stabilization, evaluated the vulnerability and resilience of ice wedges to climate change and disturbances, and developed new conceptual models of ice-wedge dynamics that identify the main factors affecting ice-wedge degradation and stabilization and the main stages of this quasi-cyclic process. We found significant differences in the patterns of ice-wedge degradation and stabilization between the two areas, and the patterns were more complex than those previously described because of the interactions of changing topography, water redistribution, and vegetation/soil responses that can interrupt or reinforce degradation. Degradation of ice wedges is usually triggered by an increase in the active-layer thickness during exceptionally warm and wet summers or as a result of flooding or disturbance. Vulnerability of ice wedges to thermokarst is controlled by the thickness of the intermediate layer of the upper permafrost, which overlies ice wedges and protects them from thawing. In the continuous permafrost zone, degradation of ice wedges rarely leads to their complete melting; and in most cases wedges eventually stabilize and can then resume growing, indicating a somewhat cyclic and reversible process. Stabilization of ice wedges after their partial degradation makes them better protected than before degradation because the intermediate layer is usually 2 to 3 times thicker on top of stabilized ice wedges than on top of initial ice wedges in undisturbed conditions. As a result, the likelihood of formation of large thaw lakes in the continuous permafrost zone triggered by ice-wedge degradation alone is very low. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Keith, JO				Keith, JO			An overview of the American White Pelican	WATERBIRDS					29th Annual Meeting of the Pacific-Seabird-Group	FEB 20-23, 2002	Santa Barbara, CA	Pacific Seabird Grp				Comments on the American White Pelican (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos) in North America languished until Peter Ogden reported trapping one during his 1825 expedition to Utah. Brief accounts of the American White Pelican by ornithologists continued through the 1940s. In subsequent decades, scientific studies uncovered greater details of the species' biology and natural history although documenting numbers has been difficult and tentative. Estimates of numbers of adults began at 30,000 in 1933, increased to over 100,000 by 1985, and by 1995 the total number of birds, then also including non-breeders, was estimated to be around 400,000. Beginning in the 1880s, their feeding and nesting sites were degraded by engineered water diversions and drainage of wetlands for agriculture. At the same time, pelicans were shot and clubbed, and eggs and young were intentionally destroyed largely because the birds were thought to compete with humans for fish. After the 1960s, hundreds of pelicans died yearly due to the ingestion of insecticides such as toxaphene, endrin, and dieldrin. As recently as winter 1998-99, 800 American White Pelicans died in Florida from poisoning by insecticides that were resuspended from flooded agricultural soils. In 1996 a disease pandemic at Salton Sea, California, killed over 7,500 pelicans in just several months. American White Pelicans have adapted to much persecution by simply moving. Overall, I do not believe that unusual mortalities have threatened their abundance.																			1524-4695						2005	28				1		9	17		10.1675/1524-4695(2005)28[9:AOOTAW]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1675/1524-4695(2005)28[9:AOOTAW]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000232808400003
J	SCHUT, PH; EVANS, RD; SCHEIDER, WA				SCHUT, PH; EVANS, RD; SCHEIDER, WA			VARIATION IN TRACE-METAL EXPORTS FROM SMALL CANADIAN SHIELD WATERSHEDS	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Annual exports of Cu, Pb, and Cd were estimated for eleven headwater and two lake outflow streams in the District of Muskoka, Ontario, Canada. CoCl2-APDC coprecipitation coupled with anodic stripping voltammetry was used to determine metal concentrations. Concentrations of all three metals were similar to those reported from other temperature forested ecosystems, being usually less than 1 .mu.g L-1 with Cd undetectable (<25 ng L-1) in many samples. There was limited evidence for a spring peak in metal concentrations associated with the snowpack melt. Annual export (mass per unit area per year) of each metal was calculated; variability between streams was small. Exports of Pb appear to be related to the organic content of the water. Copper export was correlated with watershed area, not with organic acids, implying that a different transport mechanism and possibly a different source are important for this metal. The exports of Pb and Cu were much lower in all streams than the estimated annual atmospheric metal depositions reported for this area in the literature. Terrestrial retention was higher than 95% for all catchments, while lake retention was slightly lower in some cases. Despite the small fractional loss of trace metal from the watersheds, terrestrial inputs can comprise a significant portion of the total metal load to typical lakes in this region because of size of the catchments relative to the lake areas.																			0049-6979	1573-2932				APR	1986	28	3-4					225	237																WOS:A1986C153200002

Production and fate of the sea lamprey migratory pheromone	FISH PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY												Biochemical studies demonstrate that three steroids postulated to function as the sea lamprey migratory pheromone are released in sufficient quantities, and possess adequate stability and binding characteristics, to function as a multi-component pheromone in natural river waters Mass spectrometric (MS) analyses of the holding water of recently fed larval lamprey demonstrated that each of these compounds is released at rates of 5-25 ng larva(-1) h(-1), adequate to produce picomolar (biologically relevant) concentrations in river waters Petromyzonamine disulfate (PSDS) was released at about twice the rate of the other two components, petromyzonamine disulfate (PADS) and petromyzonol sulfate (PS) Unfed larvae also released all three steroids but only at about two-thirds the rate of fed larvae and in a different ratio However, a behavioral test of fed and unfed larval holding waters suggested this change in pheromone ratio does not diminish pheromonal signal function in the winter when larvae are not feeding A study of steroid degradation found that PADS and PSDS had half-lives of about 3 days, similar to values previously described for PS and sufficiently slow for the entire pheromone to persist in river mouths Finally, both MS and electro-olfactogram recording found that contrary to previous suggestions, natural levels of natural organic matter found in streams do not bind to these steroids in ways that diminish their natural biological potency In conclusion, it appears highly likely that a mixture of PADS, PSDS and PS is present at biologically relevant concentrations and ratios in many Great Lakes streams where it functions as a pheromonal attractant						Sorensen, Peter/0000-0003-0321-1279													0920-1742	1573-5168				DEC	2010	36	4					1013	1020		10.1007/s10695-010-9379-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10695-010-9379-6								20091116					WOS:000285069700021

Benthic biomass increased greatly between 1979 and 1993 because of the presence of dreissenids, and > 90% of benthic production in 1993 came from dreissenids. Biomass of "other" benthos (excluding unionids and dreissenids) did nos decline. Dreissenid production was in addition to, and nor at the expense of "other" benthic production. Zooplankton production was close to or within the 95% confidence interval of that predicted from primary production (photosynthesis) based on the relationship described by Makarewicz and Likens (1979). Deviations from this relationship were correlated with summer zooplankton mean length, suggesting that planktivory was an important factor in the regulation of zooplankton production in the lake. Dreissenids therefore impact zooplankton production by reducing algal biomass and primary production particularly in unstratified regions, by decreasing rotifer abundance and hence biomass and production, and by producing veligers which contribute 10% to 25% to zooplankton production. Potential fish biomass which could be supported by the benthic and pelagic foodwebs was estimated from empirical equations. The benthic food chain could potentially support more fish biomass than the pelagic food chain in all basins in 1993, even if dreissenids were excluded from the calculations.																			0380-1330						2000	26	1					31	54		10.1016/S0380-1330(00)70671-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(00)70671-X													WOS:000086696200004

Despite the suggestion that evaporative concentration was involved in the formation of spherulite and shrubby-bearing carbonate successions in the Pre-Salt Cretaceous alkaline lakes of the South Atlantic, no consensus exists about the water chemistries promoting these exotic mineral textures. In this work, an experimental approach was developed to evaluate how changes in salinity (NaCl) and biopolymer concentrations (alginic acid) impact calcite growth dynamics from saline and alkaline synthetic solutions. Hydrochemical and petrographical data from selected modern saline/alkaline environments were compared with experimental datasets to further estimate how the underlying (bio)chemical conditions and lake locations probably converge to allow the formation of calcite spherulite grains in evaporitic settings. Spherulitic calcite from Recent saline lakes and experiments arise from waters with moderate to high [Calcium]/[Alkalinity] ratios ([Ca]/[Alk]) rather than in calcium-depleted and alkaline-rich environments which tend to produce single-crystal calcites during abiotic water mixing or lake evaporation. This observation is consistent with the assembly of polycrystalline textures being a kinetically controlled feature, forced by remarkably high rates of nucleation. Also, the data analysed do not support a causative relationship between evaporite-driven salinity fluctuations and the preferential formation of spherulites, shrubs or their intermediate textures. Ubiquitous in saline lakes, organic substances can lower the kinetic thresholds for spherulitic calcite aggregation while microbial photosynthesis can also raise pH, altogether enhancing calcite supersaturation and promoting spherulite formation in waters with moderate-high [Ca]/[Alk] ratios and high salinities. Localised observations of abiotic spherulites in Recent soda lakes can occur in restricted mixing zones where [Ca]/[Alk] ratios are enhanced. This work highlights the roles of concentration regimes associated with biopolymers and microbial metabolism against the background salinity fluctuations in determining the morphological and textural transitions in lacustrine carbonate minerals.

Location The Boras and faunas come from various localities in North-east Greenland. Methods Sediment samples were wet sieved, and macrofossils picked out and dated by the AMS radiocarbon-dating method. Results Sediments, dated to the first centuries after the last glacial stage came to an abrupt end, contain a macroflora of bryophytes and a few herbs, and we suggest that these plant remains represent a pioneer vegetation entirely without woody plants. The named species of herbs are either confined to the northern parts of Greenland at present, or they become increasingly more important towards the north. Crowberry is the oldest woody plant recovered; it was present at 10.4 cal. ka sp, and it appears to have been common during the early Holocene in East Greenland. Main conclusions We suggest that the majority of the extant flora of vascular plants of East Greenland arrived by long distance dispersal during the Holocene. Some species may also have arrived during the late-glacial, and a few hardy species that are adapted to low summer temperatures may have survived the last glacial stage in nonglaciated areas. Some hardy animals may also have survived, but the majority of the fauna are considered Holocene immigrants. We suggest that migrating birds and storms, perhaps in combination, are under-appreciated dispersal vectors.

Past dynamics can be reconstructed with the REVEALS model, which requires pollen productivity estimates (PPE) that are calibrated using surface pollen and vegetation data. Here we calculated PPE values for five savanna taxa using the extended R-value (ERV) model and two pollen dispersal options: the Gaussian plume model (GPM) and the Lagrangian stochastic model (LSM). The ERV calculations failed to produce a reliable PPE for Poaceae. We therefore used Combretaceae as the reference taxon - although values obtained with Poaceae as the reference taxon are presented in the supplement. Our results indicate that Combretaceae is the taxon with the highest pollen productivity and Grewia the taxon with the lowest productivity. Acacia and Dichrostachys are intermediate pollen producers. We find no clear indication of whether the GPM PPEs or the LSM PPEs are more realistic, but the differences between these values confirmed that the pollen fall speed has a greater effect in the modelling of GPM than in the LSM. We also applied REVEALS to the pollen record of Lake Otjikoto (northern Namibia) and obtained the first quantitative reconstruction of the last 130 years of vegetation history in the region. Cover estimates for Poaceae indicate the predominance of a semi-open landscape throughout the 20th century, while cover values below 50% since the 21st century correspond to a thick savanna. This change in grass cover is associated with the spread of Vachellia, Senegalia and Grewia reflecting an encroached state.					; Kruse, Stefan/AAE-1162-2019; Mapani, Benjamin/KJB-7400-2024	Tabares, Ximena/0000-0002-9866-3843; Herzschuh, Ulrike/0000-0003-0999-1261; Mapani, Benjamin/0000-0002-5354-3397													0959-6836	1477-0911				JUL	2021	31	7					1100	1111	09596836211003193	10.1177/09596836211003193	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836211003193		MAR 2021											WOS:000638299700001
J	Li, W; Qin, BQ; Zhu, GW				Li, Wei; Qin, Boqiang; Zhu, Guangwei			Forecasting short- term cyanobacterial blooms in Lake Taihu, China, using a coupled hydrodynamic- algal biomass model	ECOHYDROLOGY												Lake Taihu, the third largest freshwater lake of China, provides drinking water supply for five million people. Over the last 30years, the lake has suffered from serious cyanobacterial blooms that deteriorate drinking water quality and in some cases have led to serious water supply crises. For local government to respond quickly to the onset of a cyanobacterial bloom, it is crucial to forecast the probability, areas, and intensity of the bloom. In this paper, an attempt to forecast the cyanobacterial bloom in Lake Taihu is documented. The forecast is based on a short-term cyanobacterial bloom forecasting numerical model containing a three-dimensional, coupled hydrodynamic-algal biomass model and a probability of bloom occurrence forecasting model. The former model was based on solving the governing equations of the cyanobacterial bloom dynamics in shallow lakes. Unstructured mesh division was used to fit the irregular coastal boundaries where harmful blooms often happened. The finite volume method discretized the governing equations, and the conservation laws were preserved. To drive the model, the initial algae chlorophyll a concentrations were obtained from 18 automatic monitoring buoys and boat survey measurements. By combining calculation and prediction of the hydrological and meteorologic scenarios over the ensuing 3days, the dynamic distributions of the algae concentration scenarios in Lake Taihu were simulated. Blooming probabilities were then predicted by a forecast model that included the weight of algal biomass, wind velocity, and weather condition. The model was applied to predict the occurrences of the algae blooms of the next 3days in Lake Taihu during April to September in 2009 and 2010. Independent evaluations from remote sensing images and boat survey data showed that the accuracy of these bloom forecasts was more than 80%. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Rotifers and the predatory Cercopagis, Bythotrephes, Leptodora, and Diacyclops were collected from 1984 to 2013 in Lake Ontario. In contrast to a previous study, total rotifer abundance decreased. Of the six common genera, Polyarthra and Keratella abundances significantly decreased; Conochilus, Kellicottia, Synchaeta, and Asplanchna abundances did not Relative abundances of Conochilus and Keratella remained the same, but relative abundance of Kellicottia increased from 12.6% to 24.7% of the population after 1999. Bythotrephes predation on rotifers was minimal, as this species was not observed in quantity during the summer months when rotifers were present. Although Leptodora and Diacyclops predation cannot be ruled out, populations of these genera were higher prior to the Cercopagis invasion and did not appear to be causal in the observed decline in rotifers. The changes in rotifer populations observed did coincide with the introduction of the exotic, predaceous cladoceran Cercopagis. Selective feeding on rotifers by Cercopagis was likely, as relative abundance of colonial and loricated large-spine species increased and non-loricated forms such as Polyarthra decreased in abundance and relative abundance. However, with the long-term decrease in chlorophyll and phosphorus, which were reduced to similar to 10 from similar to 25 mu g P/L in the late 1990s, a definitive causal factor cannot be determined. The decrease in abundance of total rotifers was likely a response to decreased chlorophyll levels in Lake Ontario, while the change in relative abundance and composition of loricated and colonial forms suggests that a top-down selective response may be occurring.

Caddisflies (Trichoptera) of Mongolia: an updated checklist with faunistic and biogeographical notes	ZOOKEYS												To establish the biogeographic affinities of the caddisfly fauna of Mongolia, published records and results of our faunistic studies were analyzed. This study captured more than 47,000 adults collected from 386 locations beside lakes, ponds, streams/rivers, and springs in ten sub-basins of Mongolia using Malaise traps, aerial sweeping, and ultraviolet lights. In total, 201 species have been recorded, and approximately 269 species may occur in Mongolia according to our estimation. In a comparison of species richness for the family level, the Limnephilidae and Leptoceridae were the richest in species. The families Brachycentridae, Glossosomatidae, and Psychomyiidae had low species richness, but they included the most dominant species in terms of abundance and/or the percentage of occurrence in the samples from multiple sub-basins. Comparing the sub-basins, the Selenge had the highest Shannon diversity (H' = 3.3) and the Gobi sub-basin had the lowest (H' = 1.5). According to the Jaccard index of similarity, caddisfly species assemblages of Mongolia's ten sub-basins were divided into two main groups: One group includes the Selenge, Shishkhed, Bulgan, Tes, and Depression of Great Lakes sub-basins; the other group includes the Kherlen, Onon, Khalkh Gol, Valley of Lakes, and Gobi sub-basins. The majority of Mongolian species were composed of East Palearctic taxa, with a small percentage of West Palearctic and Nearctic representatives and an even smaller percentage from the Oriental region, suggesting that the Mongolian Gobi Desert is, and has been, a significant barrier to the distribution of caddisfly species between China and Mongolia.

The lake was generated by a large landslide that dammed the Cuejdel brook (in Stanisoarei Mountains, Eastern Carpathians) during the summer of 1991. Cuejdel Lake was officially designated a national natural reserve by the Governmental Decision 2151/2004 regarding the creation of new protected areas and the conservation of natural flora and fauna habitats. Since 2011, our team has monitored the lake and studied the evolution of this limnosystem at the level of the lacustrine depression and its reception basin. Our research results indicated that, after 20 years of evolution and negative changes in the value of its morpho-bathymetric parameters (surface -2.37ha, max. depth - 2.3m, total volume - 26.77.10(4)m(3)), the lake is now in a relative hydrodynamic equilibrium with the obstructive dam. This paper is aimed to highlight the ecological features of this limnosystem that could further help to identify better solutions for the conservation of the lacustrine cuvette, in the context of an increasing anthropic pressure (deforestations, water pollution, uncontrolled tourist impact etc). The research indicates that the integration of the Cuejdel natural reserve and its reception basin within the Vanatori-Neam. Natural Park could be the best solution to preserve this hydro-morphological site and its biodiversity.

A relationship between population densities of the zebra mussel and their respiration demands for oxygen is developed, which can be used to support the analysis of the impact of zebra mussel infestation on the oxygen resources of streams and rivers. Dramatic changes in the water quality of the Seneca River, N.Y., a major tributary to Lake Ontario, have been brought about by zebra mussel infestation. These changes are documented from 3 years of monitoring data. The infestation converted the Seneca River from a turbid, phytoplankton-rich, nutrient-depleted system, with nearly saturated oxygen concentrations, to a river with high clarity, low-phytoplankton concentrations, enriched in dissolved nutrients, with greatly undersaturated oxygen concentrations. The degradation of oxygen resources was severe enough to cause violations of New York State standards for daily minimum and daily average concentrations for a number of days in the late summer of 1993. The associated loss in the waste assimilative capacity of the river is confounding waste discharge management and planning efforts in the river basin. This form of degradation is expected for other systems as the zebra mussel infestation spreads. The impact is expected to be greatest in rivers and streams with high concentrations of phytoplankton, large areas of rock substrate, and limited reaeration capacity.																			1061-4303	1554-7531				MAR-APR	1996	68	2					205	214		10.2175/106143096X127622	http://dx.doi.org/10.2175/106143096X127622													WOS:A1996TZ12200010

The 1 yr old male shrimps attain a body length of 67-100 mm and weight of 4-15.8 g; 1 yr old berried females weigh 4.1-6.9 g and non-berried ones 2.3-5.7 g. Berried females lose between 1.1-1.8 g body weight after release of larvae. No correlation was found between weight of eggs and number of larvae released. M. nipponense shows marked tolerance for extreme temperatures as evidenced both from the fact that Lake Kojimo-Ko reaches a mean temperature of 5.degree. C during the winter and from the 34.degree. C temperature used for the laboratory molting experiments. At temperatures of 26-34.degree. c, females tend to molt approximately every 15 days, 1/3 of the moltings being pre-mating ones. Larvae grown on a rotifer diet died after 12-13 days of growth. Larvae grown on an Artemia diet reached the postlarval stage after 18 days with 15% survival. Larvae grown on a mixed rotifer-Artemia diet reached the zoea IX stage with 50% survival. As pH rose to 9.0, larval food consumption slowed down. A complete change of water and the change in pH increased the feeding rate anew.																			0005-4577						1977	29	4					115	124																WOS:A1977EH57100001

However, sondes that are part of buoy deployments often suffer from typically being fixed at one depth. Because water treatment plants are interested in water quality at a depth of the water intake and other stakeholders (ex. boaters and swimmers) are interested in the surface, we examined whether a fixed depth of approximately 1 m could cause over- or under-estimation of cyanobacterial biomass. We sampled the vertical distribution of cyanobacteria adjacent to a water quality sonde buoy in the western basin of Lake Erie during the summers of 2015-2017. A comparison of buoy cyanobacteria RFU (Relative Fluorescence Unit) at 1 m to cyanobacteria chlorophyll a (chla) measured throughout the water column showed occurrences when the buoy both under and overestimated the cyanobacteria chla at specific depths. Largest differences between buoy measurements and at-depth grab samples occurred during low wind speeds (< 4.5 m/sec) because low winds allowed cyanobacteria to accumulate at the surface above the buoy's sonde. Higher wind speeds (> 4.5 m/sec) resulted in better agreement between the buoy and at-depth measurements. Averaging wind speeds 12 hr before sample collection decreased the difference between the buoy and at-depth samples for high wind speeds but not low speeds. We suggest that sondes should be placed at a depth of interest for the appropriate stakeholder group or deploy sondes with the ability to sample at various depths.

Jake			Regional-Level Inputs of Emergent Aquatic Insects from Water to Land	ECOSYSTEMS												Emergent aquatic insects can provide inputs to terrestrial ecosystems near lentic and lotic waterbodies, producing ecosystem linkages at the aquatic-terrestrial interface. Although aquatic insect emergence has been examined for individual sites, the magnitude and spatial distribution of this phenomenon has not been examined at regional spatial scales. Here, we characterize this cross-habitat linkage for the state of Wisconsin, USA (169,639 km(2)). We combined GIS hydrological data with empirical data and predictive models of aquatic insect production to estimate annual aquatic emergence for the state of Wisconsin. Total emergence (lentic + lotic) was estimated to be about 6,800 metric tons of C y(-1). Lentic systems comprised 79% of total estimated insect emergence, primarily due to the large amount of lake surface area relative to streams. This is due to both basic ecosystem geometry and the overall abundance of lakes in Wisconsin. Spatial variation was high: insect emergence in southwestern Wisconsin was dominated by streams, whereas for most of the rest of the state insect emergence was dominated by lakes. Lentic inputs to land were highly concentrated (relative to lotic inputs) because lakes have a high ratio of surface area to buffer area. Although less concentrated, the spatial extent of lotic influence was greater: statewide, four times more land area fell within the 100 m buffer zones of streams compared to lakes. Large waterbodies (almost all of which were lakes) were hotspots of insect emergence and input to land. Aquatic insect inputs exceed estimated terrestrial secondary production in 13% of buffer area, and by a factor of 100 or more adjacent to large lakes (> 50,000 ha). The model sensitivity analysis showed that the simplifying assumptions and sources of potential error in the input variables had a minor impact on the overall results.					; , Claudio/KRP-6122-2024; Bartrons, Mireia/D-3452-2014	Gratton, Claudio/0000-0001-6262-9670; Bartrons, Mireia/0000-0003-0617-9577; Vander Zanden, Jake/0000-0002-8122-1416; Papes, Monica/0009-0007-9662-5580													1432-9840	1435-0629				NOV	2013	16	7					1353	1363		10.1007/s10021-013-9688-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-013-9688-6													WOS:000325424500014

This limnological-technological cooperation has aimed at the precision dredging of sediment strata responsible for the internal nutrient loading of lake ecosystems. Suction dredging is mainly restricted to small lakes of high environmental value. Prior to in-lake measures, the external loading of an ecosystem has to be brought under control. Whenever possible pumped sediment ought to be used as fertiliser. The heavily polluted Lake Trummen, dredged in 1970-1971, was turned into an environmental asset. The cyanobacterial blooms (summer transparency 15-20 cm) disappeared and were replaced by a plankton community rich in species. The ecosystem as a whole recovered to a functional unit, characterised by a balance between production and decomposition. In the urbanised area of Vaxjo, Lake Trummen became available for a variety of recreation activities. The ecosystem conditions are continuously monitored. As in Lake Trummen, Lake Vajgar was in a degraded condition characterised by heavy blooms of cyanobacteria caused by intensive internal phosphorus loading. After unsatisfactory experiments with a suction dredger available on the market, an automatically-controlled, precision dredger was designed, constructed and used to remove the defined top sediment layer in 1991-1992. The Vajgar ecosystem immediately changed from being a source to functioning as a trap for phosphorus. However, because the external loading from the catchment area remained high, Lake Vajgar again gradually developed conditions favourable for cyanobacteria.																			1875-1261		978-90-481-9264-9				2010	3						101	122		10.1007/978-90-481-9265-6_8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-90-481-9265-6_8	10.1007/978-90-481-9265-6												WOS:000281253400008

However, disparate interpretations still exist concerning different proxies. The spatial and temporal heterogeneities have inhibited a holistic understanding of general patterns and underlying mechanisms. To address these issues, two parallel cores (ONW I, 6.00 m; ONW II, 13.35 m) were retrieved in the Gobi Desert of Mongolia from lake Orog Nuur. Multidisciplinary investigations including geomorphological mapping, radiocarbon dating, sedimentological, palynological and ostracod analyses enabled us to gain a comprehensive dataset for vegetation development and hydrological variability over the last similar to 45 kyr. Higher lake levels during the Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 and early MIS 2 (similar to 35-similar to 24 kyr) were probably caused by increased precipitation. The sharp transition of Termination I (similar to 11 kyr) is indicated by sedimentological, palynological, and ostracod data. During the late Pleistocene, the lower area of the Orog Nuur catchment was dominated by Artemisia steppe and gradually altered to Chenopodiaceae desert steppe in the Holocene. The early Holocene is also characterized by a relatively humid environment. The humid pulses during the MIS 3 and the early Holocene were also recorded in other archives and are possibly the trait of a larger scale phenomenon in arid central Asia. Four major harsh climatic periods were documented in the core at similar to 43 kyr, similar to 36 kyr, during the global Last Glacial Maximum, and the Younger Dryas as playa phases. Reduced westerlies' moisture transport and a retreated East Asian Summer Monsoon influence probably caused those dry phases in the Gobi Desert of Mongolia.					; Stauch, Georg/O-2776-2013; Mischke, Steffen/L-9300-2015; Zeeden, Christian/AFO-4070-2022; Yu, Kaifeng/E-5343-2013; Murad, Waheed/HGE-7090-2022; Lehmkuhl, Frank/B-9671-2008	Lehmkuhl, Frank/0000-0002-6876-7377; Stauch, Georg/0000-0002-8046-140X; Mischke, Steffen/0000-0003-3821-8497; murad, waheed/0000-0002-2551-9998; Zeeden, Christian/0000-0002-8617-0443; Yu, Kaifeng/0000-0001-5434-1386; Diekmann, Bernhard/0000-0001-5129-3649; Nottebaum, Veit/0000-0003-0970-9449; Schlutz, Frank/0000-0003-2114-8146													0031-0182	1872-616X				JAN 15	2019	514						77	91		10.1016/j.palaeo.2018.10.004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2018.10.004													WOS:000456355800006

However, few studies have investigated the effects of atmospheric N deposition and the respective ecological significance in eutrophic waters. In this study, bulk and wet deposition rates of all N species and water N concentrations in Lake Taihu were determined based on the long-term (2010-2018) high-resolution (weekly or monthly) systematic observations. The results indicated that the decline in wind speed and change in land-use type likely decreased the N deposition rate. The bulk N deposition rates decreased from 45.77 kg N ha-1 yr-1 in 2012 to 22.06 kg N ha-1 yr- 1 in 2018, which could account for decrease of 1.01 mg N L-1 in the lake N concentrations via a rough estimation, and this value was close to the actual variation in N concentration in Lake Taihu. The correlation between N concentrations and atmospheric deposition fluxes was stronger than that between N concentrations and riverine N inputs or lake storage, which further indicated that change in atmospheric N deposition was the key reason for the variation in N concentrations. The direct bulk N deposition into Lake Taihu accounted for 17.5% and 51.4% of the riverine N inputs and lake N inventory, respectively. Moreover, atmospheric N deposition was concentrated in summer, which was dominated by reduced N, and it may be important for the duration of algal blooms. Therefore, external N inputs, including atmospheric N deposition, should be further controlled for an effective mitigation of eutrophication and algal blooms in Lake Taihu.					; Tang, Xiangming/ABG-7095-2021; Gao, Guang/AAJ-8676-2021; Jiang, Xingyu/AGB-8636-2022; Deng, Jianming/AAN-2998-2020	Tang, Xiangming/0000-0002-2816-1004; 													0269-7491	1873-6424				MAY 1	2022	300								118952	10.1016/j.envpol.2022.118952	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2022.118952		FEB 2022						35124122					WOS:000758451200004
J	Liu, DD; Chen, NC				Liu, Dandan; Chen, Nengcheng			Satellite Monitoring of Urban Land Change in the Middle Yangtze River Basin Urban Agglomeration, China between 2000 and 2016	REMOTE SENSING												Detailed studies on the spatiotemporal patterns of urban agglomeration in the Middle Yangtze River Basin (MYRB) are rare. This paper analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns of urbanization in the MYRB using multi-temporal remote sensing data circa 2000, 2008 and 2016 integrated with geographic information system (GIS) techniques and landscape analysis approaches. A multi-level analysis of the rate and intensity, type as well as the landscape changes of urban expansion at regional, prefectural and inner-city levels was performed. Results show that the MYRB experienced rapid urban expansion with an annual expansion rate of 3.199%, especially in the Chang-Zhu-Tan and Poyang Lake metropolitan areas. The small and medium cities presented faster urban expansion than the larger cities with annual growth rates three times the average level. Urban expansion within the three capital cities was further analyzed in detail. It is found that outlying expansion and edge-expansion were the dominant growth patterns at all the three levels. Although urbanization in the MYRB has a remarkable increase in the past sixteen years, its annual growth rate of urban land expansion has fallen behind the three other large urban agglomerations in China as a result. Finally, the spatial evolution of the socioeconomic structure of the MYRB was further explored. It indicated that urban land was distributed mainly along the "northwest-southeast" direction and that the economic spatial interactions among cities showed a pattern of "multi-polarization and fragmentation", which illustrates the weak radiative driving forces of the central cities. The MYRB urban agglomeration faces a great challenge to manage trades-offs between narrowing the intra-regional disparity and maintaining synergetic development among cities.

A total of 32 basins were sampled every year. Helium concentrations were relatively stable from year to year, exhibiting a mean coefficient of variation of 34%. Total [He] ranged from values below the atmospheric equilibrium concentration of 47 nl He/l H2O to a maximum of 5364 nl/l measured in Lake 625 in 1991. Total [He] exhibited a two-phase distribution, with a large subpopulation of basins having only modest He enrichment (geometric mean G. M. = 77 nl/l, geometric standard deviation G. S. D. = 1.65, n = 39), and a small subpopulation of basins, including Lakes 625, 634 and 615, with large He anomalies (G.M. = 692 nl/l, G.S.D. = 3.08, n = 6). Using hydrological, morphometric and physical data for each lake, bottom-water [He] was predicted. A model including lake order and lake width accounted for 22% of the total variance in [He]. These results support the hypothesis that excess He in lake-bottom-water originates with deep groundwater discharge via fractures in the underlying granite.																			0883-2927					JUL	1993	8	4					373	382		10.1016/0883-2927(93)90005-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0883-2927(93)90005-2													WOS:A1993LK28000005
J	Cancelli, DM; Dias, NL; Chamecki, M				Cancelli, Diana M.; Dias, Nelson L.; Chamecki, Marcelo			Dimensionless criteria for the production-dissipation equilibrium of scalar fluctuations and their implications for scalar similarity	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												In water resources it is common to consider that two scalars have a similar behavior in the atmospheric surface layer. This is a consequence of Monin-Obukhov similarity theory whose direct implication is that all similarity functions between two scalars are equal. However, many works show that scalar similarity does not always hold under unstable conditions, a fact for which it is often difficult to establish a physical cause. In this paper, using a data set measured during winter over a tropical lake in Brazil (Furnas Lake), we found a relation between temperature-water vapor similarity and the strength of the surface forcing; we also confirmed that the classical balance between gradient production and molecular dissipation of scalar variance and covariance is key to scalar similarity. This balance can be disrupted by large values of the third-order transport terms, and possibly by nonstationary terms as well. In connection with the scalar variance and covariance budgets, we propose a new set of dimensionless scalar flux numbers which are able to make a good diagnosis of the aforementioned balance (or the lack thereof) for each budget. The fact that different Monin-Obukhov functions are not equally capable of identifying scalar similarity is also demonstrated and a new bulk indicator of scalar flux similarity is proposed whose absolute value, unlike the relative transfer efficiency, is bounded above by 1; this new indicator holds also in the spectral domain. Finally, we verify that low-frequency dissimilarity has a larger impact over scalar similarity than over scalar flux similarity.					; Dias, Nelson/G-7300-2012; Chamecki, Marcelo/N-7469-2019	Chamecki, Marcelo/0000-0003-0576-0597; Dias, Nelson/0000-0002-9770-8595; 													0043-1397	1944-7973				OCT 12	2012	48								W10522	10.1029/2012WR012127	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2012WR012127													WOS:000309835600004

The mean density of B. cederstroemii at the offshore station was generally highest in July-September (145-914 m(-2)) and at the nearshore station in October-November (168-1625 m(-2)). In 1995 and 1998, density was also high at the offshore station in November (211-284 m(-2)). Fish predation may limit B. cederstroemii in nearshore regions in the summer. The maximum annual densities of B. cederstroemii for 1995-98 were generally similar to those reported from the late 1980s, when the species arrived in Lake Michigan. 3. Body size increased rapidly each year to a maximum in August. Thereafter, body size declined and converged for stage-2 and 3 individuals, suggesting food scarcity or size-selective fish predation was affecting large individuals. 4. Most reproduction occurred asexually (90%), and by stage 2 or 3 females (99%). Asexual brood size was highest when B. cederstroemii first appeared each year, and decreased in August, when larger neonates were produced. There appeared to be differences in reproductive mode for stage 2 and 3 females, with a higher percentage of stage 2 females reproducing sexually.					; Fahnenstiel, Gary/ABD-6133-2020	Pothoven, Steven/0000-0002-7992-5422; Vanderploeg, Henry/0000-0003-1358-8475													0046-5070	1365-2427				NOV	2001	46	11					1491	1501		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2001.00772.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2001.00772.x													WOS:000172341400006

High level multiple antibiotic resistance among fish surface associated bacterial populations in non-aquaculture freshwater environment	WATER RESEARCH												Freshwater fish, Alburnus alburnus (bleak), were captured from Lake Mogan, situated in Ankara, during spring. The surface mucus of the fish was collected and associated bacteria were cultured and isolated. By sequencing PCR-amplified 16S RNA encoding genes, the isolates were identified as members of 12 different genera: Acinetobacter, Aeromonas, Bacillus, Brevundimonas, Gordonia, Kocuria, Microbacterium, Mycobacterium, Pseudomonas, Rhodococcus, and Staphylococcus, in addition to one strain that was unidentified. The mucus-dwelling bacterial isolates were tested for resistance against ampicillin, kanamycin, streptomycin and chloramphenicol. About 95% of the isolates were found to be resistant to ampicillin, 93% to chloramphenicol, and 88% to kanamycin and streptomycin. A Microbacterium oxydans and the unidentified environmental isolate were resistant to all four antibiotics tested at very high levels (>1600 mu g/ml ampicillin and streptomycin; >1120 mu g/ml kanamycin; >960 mu g/ml chloramphenicol). Only a Kocuria sp. was sensitive to all four antibiotics at the lowest concentrations tested (3.10 mu g/ml ampicillin and streptomycin; 2.15 mu g/ml kanamycin; 1.85 mu g/ml chloramphenicol). The rest of the isolates showed different resistance levels. Plasmid isolations were carried out to determine if the multiple antibiotic resistance could be attributed to the presence of plasmids. However, no plasmid was detected in any of the isolates. The resistance appeared to be mediated by chromosome-associated functions. This study indicated that multiple antibiotic resistance at moderate to high levels is common among the current phenotypes of the fish mucus-dwelling bacterial populations in this temperate, shallow lake which has not been subjected to any aquaculturing so far but under anthropogenic effect being in a recreational area.

Cyanobacterial samples were collected from eight sites of both Lake Taihu and Lake Chaohu in late summer to determine the diversity and distribution pattern of cyanobacteria and Microcystis in large, shallow, entropic lakes with significant spatial heterogeneity and long-term Microcystis bloom. Molecular methods based on denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and clone library analysis were used. A similar heterogeneous distribution pattern of cyanobacteria in both lakes was observed. Most parts of these two lakes with high trophic level were dominated by Microcystis. However, in the regions with low trophic levels as well as low concentrations of chlorophyll a, Synechococcus occupied a considerable percentage. Different morphospecies and genotypes dominated the bloom-forming Microcystis populations in these two lakes. Microcystis viridis and Microcystis novacekii were dominant in Lake Chaohu, whereas Microcystis flos-aquae was dominant in Lake Taihu. Only 2 of the13 Microcystis operational taxonomic units were shared between these two lakes. Analysis of molecular variance based on 16S to 23S internal transcribed spacer sequences indicated the significant genetic differentiation of Microcystis between these two lakes (F-st = 0.19, p <0.001). However, only 19.46% of the genetic variability was explained by the population variation between lakes, whereas most (80.54%) of the genetic variability occurred within the lakes. Phylogenetic analysis revealed no phylogeographic structure of Microcystis population in these two lakes, as illustrated by their cosmopolitan nature. Our results revealed that spatial heterogeneity within lakes has more impact on the cyanobacterial diversity than geographical isolation in a local scale.					; yu, yang/HIZ-9682-2022	Cai, Yuanfeng/0000-0003-4924-8819; 													1001-0742	1878-7320					2012	24	10					1832	1842		10.1016/S1001-0742(11)61007-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1001-0742(11)61007-3								23520854					WOS:000310408700015

All three variables were significantly related to species richness and explained 61% of the variance in a data set from 55 limnologically similar lakes in northern Wisconsin. We developed additional ANCOVA models to assess the relative effects of these three variables on four functional species groups, including gamefish, riverine, tolerant, and intolerant species. The number of gamefish species was greater in lakes with riparian development than in undeveloped lakes; this is probably related to introductions by management agencies and anglers. Connectivity increased the number of riverine species and intolerant species. Intolerant species may be more abundant because connecting streams provide colonization routes and decrease time between periodic extirpation and recolonization events. In addition, flowing water connections may provide a refuge from winter hypoxia and decrease extirpation rates of intolerant A species. Tolerant fishes were ubiquitous on the landscape and unaffected by the measured variables. Because simple landscape variables can dominate assemblage dynamics of small takes, and human-mediated introductions can increase species richness at low and moderate levels of disturbance, the use of fish as biological indicators for small lake assessment is not practical.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				MAR	2009	24	1					7	18		10.1080/02705060.2009.9664260	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2009.9664260													WOS:000263434300002

The fact that weathering during recent glacial periods is associated with more congruent release of Hf isotopes has led to the hypothesis that the incongruency may be controlled by retention of unradiogenic Hf by zircons, and that glacial grinding enhances release of Hf from zircons. Here we study the relationship between glacial weathering processes and Hf isotope compositions released to rivers fed by land-terminating glaciers of the Greenland Ice Sheet, as well as neighbouring non-glacial streams. The weathered source rocks in the studied area mostly consist of gneisses, but also include amphibolites of the same age (1.9 Ga). Hafnium and neodymium isotope compositions in catchment sediments and in the riverine suspended load are consistent with a predominantly gneissic source containing variable trace amounts of zircon and different abundances of hornblende, garnet and titanite. Glacially sourced rivers and non-glacial streams fed by precipitation and lakes show very unradiogenic Nd isotopic compositions, in a narrow range (epsilon Nd = -42.8 to -37.9). Hafnium isotopes, on the other hand, are much more radiogenic and variable, with eHf between -18.3 and -0.9 in glacial rivers, and even more radiogenic values of +15.8 to +46.3 in nonglacial streams. Although relatively unradiogenic Hf is released by glacial weathering, glacial rivers actually fall close to the seawater array in Hf-Nd isotope space and are not distinctly unradiogenic. Based on their abundance in rocks and sediments and their isotope compositions, different minerals contribute to the radiogenic Hf in solution with a decreasing relevance from garnet to titanite, hornblende and apatite. Neodymium isotopes preclude a much stronger representation of titanite, hornblende and apatite in solution, such as might result from differences in dissolution rates, than estimated from mineral abundance. The strong contrast in Hf isotope compositions between glacial rivers and non-glacial streams results mostly from different contributions from garnet and zircon, where zircon weathering is more efficient in the subglacial environment. A key difference between glacial and non-glacial waters is the water-rock interaction time. While glacial rivers receive continuous contributions from long residence time waters of distributed subglacial drainage systems, non-glacial streams are characterized by fast superficial drainage above the permafrost horizon. Therefore, the increased congruency in Hf isotope weathering in glacial systems could simply reflect the hydrological conditions at the base of the ice-sheet and glaciers, with zircon weathering contributions increasing with water-rock interaction time.

High mountain lakes in the headwaters of the Syr Darya River serve as sensitive indicators of climate change in the region. In this study, lakes in the headwaters of the Syr Darya River are examined using a Landsat image series. A total of 959 lakes covering a total area of 328.39 +/- 5.51 km(2) were identified in 2015, of which 91% were distributed in the larger Naryn River basin, and the remaining lakes were in the smaller Kara Darya River basin. During the period of the 1990s to 2015, a clear expansion trend in both lake area (+ 6.64 km(2)) and number of lakes (+ 205) was observed. Glacial lakes contributed 69% of the increase in the number of lakes. Among the four lake types, proglacial lakes showed the fastest area expansion with an average relative growth rate of 94% from the 1990s to 2015, 5-8 times that of the other three lake types: nonglacial lakes, unconnected-fed lakes and unconnected-nonfed lakes. Lake Petrov was the fastest growing glacial lake (+ 0.05 km(2) yr(-1)) during the past century and will continue to expand as its supply glacier continues to retreat. The continuous expansion and potential outburst risk of the Lake Petrov poses a serious threat to downstream toxic tailing ponds of the Kumtor Gold Mine. Lake Song Kol, the largest natural lake in this region, presented a steady status during 1972-2017. The warming climate-caused acceleration of glacial melt is thought to be the primary reason for the lake enlargements in this region. The lake inventory prepared here is valuable baseline dataset for the evaluation of water resources in the Syr Darya River drainage basin and for the potential risk and hazard assessments of glacial lake outburst floods.					; Xie, Hongjie/B-5845-2009; Zheng, Guoxiong/AAX-3597-2021; Guo, Hao/M-1304-2017; Tao, Chen/ISU-5339-2023; Li, Junli/C-8904-2014; Chen, WenFeng/B-7923-2015; Zhang, Guoqing/F-1438-2019	li, jun li/0000-0002-1054-5966; Zheng, Guoxiong/0000-0002-9126-8357; Guo, Hao/0000-0003-0036-8879; Bao, Anming/0000-0002-6221-7403; Zhang, Guoqing/0000-0003-2090-2813; Chen, Wenfeng/0000-0002-9507-1711													0921-8181	1872-6364				MAY	2019	176						84	99		10.1016/j.gloplacha.2019.03.004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2019.03.004													WOS:000465364600007

At the times of sampling, 14 ciliate species and 10 species of autotrophic flagellate were recorded. The samples contained two species of rotifer (Philodina spp.), which formed the first record of planktonic metazoans in the Dry Valley lakes of this region of Antarctica. Bacterial concentrations ranged between 1.0 and 3.8 x 10(8) l(-1) in the upper oxic waters increasing to 20 x 10(8) l(-1) in the anoxic waters. Heterotrophic flagellates decreased in abundance down the oxygenated water column, disappearing completely at gm, and ranged between 0.28 and 7.39 x 10(5) l(-1) in abundance. Autotrophic flagellates were much more abundant exhibiting a number of distinct peaks down the water column (1.89-25.3 x 10(8) l(-1)). The ciliated protozoa were very abundant (up to 7720 l(-1)) in relation to flagellate and bacterial numbers, typical of oligotrophic lakes world-wide. The distribution of the protistan plankton showed marked zonation, probably in response to the differing salinity and temperature gradients in the water column. Possible trophic interactions are discussed and comparisons with other continental Antarctic lakes made.

Stable isotope variations in stalagmites from northwestern Sweden document climate and environmental changes during the early Holocene	HOLOCENE												This paper presents two early Holocene (9.6-5.9 ka BP) high-resolution stable isotope records of stalagmites from two caves in northwestern Sweden (Korallgrottan and Labyrintgrottan). Close similarities between the Swedish records and a previously presented Norwegian stalagmite oxygen isotope record emphasize the potential of Scandinavian stalagmites to provide high-resolution regional palaeoclimatic information. The stable oxygen isotope records are interpreted to reflect the temperature evolution during the early Holocene with a gradual warming from c. 9.6 ka BP, interrupted by cooler conditions at 8.5-8.0 ka BP. The results indicate that the cooler conditions were driven by two to three abrupt cold events rather than one '8.2 event' only. Except for these cold events the stalagmite oxygen isotope records show that temperatures in northwestern Sweden were warmer than today between 9.6 and 5.9 ka BP and that during this period the interval between 7.8 and 5.9 ka BP seems to have been the warmest. The high-amplitude changes in the stable carbon isotope record of Labyrintgrottan are proposed to reflect changes in local vegetation. The area above Labyrintgrottan was most likely covered by much denser vegetation than today at the time of stalagmite growth (9.5-7.5 ka BP) and was - unlike today - probably situated below the local tree limit between 9.0 and 8.0 ka BP.

Sedimentary evolution of Neogene continental deposits (Nirihuau Formation) along the Nirihuau River, North Patagonian Andes of Argentina	JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES												The sedimentary evolution of the Nirihuau Formation (late Oligocene-middle Miocene) was studied along the southern margin of the Nirihuau River, in the North Patagonian Andes. The 1300-m-thick section includes 15 epiclastic and volcaniclastic lithofacies which are grouped into five lithofacies associations: deep lacustrine, shallow lacustrine, fluvial channels, subaerial floodplains and volcaniclastic flows (lahar). Syn-eruptive and inter-eruptive stages are recorded along the Nirihuau River section. The former consist of highly aggradational packages several tens of meters thick of ash-fall beds and lahar deposits. During inter-eruptive periods sedimentation took place mostly in shallow and deep lacustrine environments, with four cycles of lake expansion and contraction, and a minor proportion of fluvial deposits. Sedimentary supply originated from the northeast and northwest in the lower part of the unit through low to moderate sinuosity fluvial systems, flowing into a lake with high-gradient margins, and forming Gilbert-type deltas. The younger sections were sourced from the northeast, east and southeast, indicating changes in the basin morphology. Basic and intermediate volcanic rocks similar to those of the Ventana Formation (Oligocene) are interstratified at the beginning of the sedimentation. The syn-orogenic nature of the Nirihuau Formation is evidenced by the changes in the basin shape, but mainly by the differences in styles and intensities of deformation between the Nirihuau River section and the overlying outcrops of La Buitrera Hill, both separated by a folded unconformity.

A reservoir water quality model and one year of baseline meteorologic, hydrologic, and inflow water quality input were used to simulate current reservoir water quality. Total adult striped bass habitat, defined by specific quantitative temperature and dissolved oxygen criteria, was simulated. Daily reservoir volumes with optimal, suboptimal, and unsuitable temperature and DO were predicted for the year. Output from recent runs of atmospheric general circulation models (GCMs), in which atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations have been doubled, was then used to adjust the baseline inputs to the water quality model. New sets of input data were created for two grid cells for each of three GCMs. All six climate scenarios are predicted to cause overall declines in the available summer striped bass habitat, mostly due to lake water temperatures exceeding striped bass tolerance levels. These predictions are believed to result from the consensus among GCM scenarios that air temperatures and humidity will rise, and the sensitivity of the reservoir model to these parameters. The reservoir model was found to be a promising tool for examining potential climate-change impacts. Some of the assumptions required to apply GCM output to the reservoir model, however, illustrate the problems in using large-scale grid-cell output to assess small-scale impacts.

J	Chen, YR; Liu, XQ				Chen, Yaru; Liu, Xingqi			Vegetation and climate changes since the middle MIS 3 inferred from a Lake Ailike pollen record, xinjiang, arid central asia	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 is the latest interstadial to be a significant period for paleoclimate research. The mild interstadial climate in MIS 3 can shed light on studies of the current warming period. However, it is uncertain whether or not the humidity in MIS 3 exceeds that in Holocene level, and forcing mechanisms of paleoclimate evolution remains controversial. In this paper, we use pollen and AMS C-14 dating data of a sediment core Ailike-2019 (4.49 m) recovered from Lake Ailike, Xinjiang in arid central Asia, to reconstruct the vegetation and climate changes in Lake Ailike over the last 40,000 years. The results show that Lake Ailike region has been dominated by desert vegetation since the middle MIS 3. The vegetation coverage shows that climate was arid in the middle MIS 3 (40.2-33.2 cal kyr BP), ameliorated during the late MIS 3 (33.2-26.7 cal kyr BP) but still dry, extremely dry during MIS 2 (26.7-12 cal kyr BP), and relatively wet during Holocene (12-0 cal kyr BP). The climate in the Holocene was wetter than in the mid-late MIS 3 in Lake Ailike, which is generally consistent with the paleoclimate records from arid central Asia and Europe. This climate pattern might be attributed to amounts of vapor transported by the westerlies and Siberian high pressure. Low/high Northern Atlantic sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) induced by decreased/increased Northern Hemisphere summer insolation resulted in westerlies transporting less/more amount of vapor to the arid central Asia during MIS 3/Holocene. Meanwhile, intensified/weakened Siberian high pressure resulting from the expanding/melting of ice sheet might induce dry/wet climate conditions in the mid-late MIS 3/the Holocene.

Coupling of the biochemical composition and calorific content of zooplankters with the Microcystis aeruginosa proliferation in a highly eutrophic reservoir	ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY												The impact of the Cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa on zooplankton dynamics was studied in the hypertrophic Villerest Reservoir (France). Samples were collected and their biochemical composition and calorific content examined. Three most abundant zooplankton species in the reservoir were considered: the cladoceran Daphnia longispina and the copepods Cyclops vicinus and Eudiaptoinus gracilis. The three species were differently affected by the Microcystis aeruginosa blooms. Daphnia longispina did not seem to suffer from the proliferation of the M. aeruginosa, although its biomass decreased concomitantly to the bloom. This collapse would be attributable to the lack of nutritional value of algae. Cyclops vicinus seemed to move away when Microcystis invaded the superficial layers of the reservoir. Because this zooplankter had migratory abilities, it reached the littoral zone where food was available. The energetic costs linked to this migration were clearly pointed out when the species recovered the pelagial zone in early fall. The behaviour of Eudiaptomus gracilis was not clear. This species underwent diapause as M. aeruginosa proliferated. This suggests that Eudiaptomus gracilis moved away from the pelagial zone over the cyanobacterial blooms. In most cases, the cyanobacterial toxins affected the growth of zooplankton and the potential to use herbivorous zooplankton as a means to combat Microcystis proliferation in the Villerest reservoir seems limited.																			0959-3330	1479-487X				NOV	2006	27	11					1181	1190		10.1080/09593332708618738	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593332708618738								17203599					WOS:000242448200001

The first, conducted at the La Grande complex in northern Quebec, involved two provincial universities and evaluated their respective sampling and analytical protocols. Some samples were spiked with a known amount of CH3HgCl and HgCl2 to evaluate the accuracy of the results. Samples preserved with HCl at pH<2 were analyzed up to 45 days after sampling without any change in the total Hg concentration. Filtration at the analytical lab of samples that had been previously frozen resulted in almost complete loss of Hg and CH3Hg. It is recommended that filtration, if required, should be performed at the sampling point. The second intercomparison examined only analytical performances and included a total of seven laboratories which analyzed two samples from the Experimental Lake Area, in Northwestern Ontario. The standard deviation was 24 and 14% in total Hg for the first five labs and 31 and 21% in CH3Hg for the first four labs. The average spike recovery in total Hg measured by three labs was 101 +/- 9%, but the two labs that performed spike recoveries on CH3Hg obtained variable results in one case and a constant negative bias in the other case. Standard addition on all samples is recommended to assure the accuracy of CH3Hg analysis.																			0049-6979					FEB	1995	80	1-4					1247	1256		10.1007/BF01189788	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01189788													WOS:A1995RM44200143

Design-Matched case-control study. Setting-The Achterhoek area, the Netherlands. Subjects-98 cases with otitis externa and 149 controls matched for age, sex, and place of residence. Main outcome measures-Odds ratios for type of swimming water and frequency of swimming; presence of P aeruginosa in ear swabs and fresh water lakes. Results-Otitis externa was strongly associated with swimming in recreational fresh water lakes in the previous two weeks (odds ratio 15.5 (95% confidence interval) 4.9 to 49.2) compared with non-swimming). The risk increased with the number of days of swimming, and subjects with recurrent ear disease had a greatly increased risk. The lakes met the Dutch bathing water standards and those set by the European Commission for faecal pollution in the summer of 1994, but P aeruginosa was isolated from all of them, as well as from the ear swabs of 78 (83%) of the cases and 3 (4%) of the controls. Conclusions-Even when current bathing water standards are met, swimming can be associated with a substantial risk of otitis externa because of exposure to P aeruginosa. People with recurrent ear disease should take special care when swimming in waters containing P aeruginosa.

The northern coast of Bohai Bay (NCBB), with a thick accumulation of Quaternary lacustrine sediments, is a subsiding area and is well suited to studying tectonic versus climatic controls on sedimentary processes. We used magnetostratigraphy and sedimentological analyses of borehole core JL01 from the NCBB to provide new insights into the effects of tectonic processes and climate changes in this region. The results show the following: (1) A shallow lacustrine delta, a deep -water lacustrine sedimentary system and a subaqueous fan -delta sedimentary system developed during 2.1 -1.4 Ma, 1.4 -0.78 Ma, and from 0.78 Ma to the present, respectively, corresponding to the rift -initiation, rift -climax, and late -rift tectonic stages of the evolution of an extensional basin, respectively. These stages constitute a low -order tectono-sedimentary cycle. (2) Tectonic and orbital -scale climate changes can be distinguished, particularly the 2.5 Ma climatic transition and a significant shift from 41- to 100-kyr cyclicity across the Mid -Pleistocene climatic transition. These changes indicate that the sedimentary processes of the NCBB were influenced by high -latitude climate forcing since the Late Pliocene. Our results demonstrate that detailed sedimentary facies analyses can provide valuable information about the effects of tectonics and climate changes on basin sedimentary evolution. This approach can be applied to other regional basins worldwide.

Spatial Distribution and Preservation of Carbon Isotope Biosignatures in Freshwater Microbialite Carbonate	ACS EARTH AND SPACE CHEMISTRY												Understanding formation mechanisms of modern microbialites enables interpretation of biosignatures associated with fossilized stromatolites. Photosynthetic influences on carbonate precipitation are one proposed mechanism. Photosynthetic isotope biosignatures (C-13) associated with freshwater microbialites in Pavilion Lake, British Columbia were widespread through the lake but less prevalent with increasing depth. Importantly, they were variably detectable on the exterior surface of individual microbialites. At depths <= 18 m, microbialite surface carbonates, associated with either nodular microbial communities or surface biofilms, had delta C-13(carb) values up to +3.7 that were C-13-enriched above the predicted range of delta C-13(carb) values for equilibrium precipitation from bulk ambient lake water dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) (predicted mean delta C-13(carb) = -0.2 +/- 1.3). Vertical profiles of exterior, non-nodular biofilm present on microbialites collected from depths of 21 m and below showed instances of C-13-enrichment near the apex, consistent with hypothesized maximum light exposure. With increased distance from the apex toward the structure base, delta C-13(carb) values typically decreased into the predicted range of equilibrium delta C-13 values. Surface biosignatures persisted internally for distances of 0.5 to 2 cm below the exterior of the structures, beyond which they fell within the predicted isotopic equilibrium range. This shift in delta C-13(carb) values may be due to secondary carbonate precipitation masking of the C-13-enriched signature. The contribution of secondary carbonate precipitation was estimated to be 1459% of total carbonate mass if derived from heterotroph-influenced or bulk lake DIC, respectively. Growth rate estimates suggested these accretion processes can mask photosynthetic signatures in 20400 years.

Sagebrush steppe dominated the northern Bonneville basin during the Full Glacial, suggesting that conditions were cold and relatively dry, in contrast to the southern basin, which was also cold but moister, Limber pine woodlands dominated --13-11.5 ka, indicating increased dryness and summer temperatures --6-7 degreesC cooler than present. This drying trend accelerated after --11.5 ka causing Lake Bonneville to drop rapidly, eliminating 11 species of fish from the lake. From --11.5-8.2 ka xerophytic sagebrush and shadscale scrub replaced more mesophilic shrubs in a step-wise fashion. A variety of small mammals and plants indicate the early Holocene was --3 degreesC cooler and moister than at present, not warmer as suggested by a number of climatic models. The diversity of plants and animals changed dramatically after 8.2 ka as many species disappeared from the record. Some of the upland species returned after --4 ka and Great Salt Lake became fresh enough at --3.4 and --1.2 ka to support populations of Utah chub. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

A comparison of biomarker records of northeast African vegetation from lacustrine and marine sediments (ca. 3.40 Ma)	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Integrated terrestrial and marine records of northeast African vegetation are needed to provide long high resolution records of environmental variability with established links to specific terrestrial environments. In this study, we compare records of terrestrial vegetation preserved in marine sediments in the Gulf of Aden [Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) Site 231] and an outcrop of lacustrine sediments in the Turkana Basin, Kenya, part of the East African Rift System. We analyzed higher plant biomarkers in sediments from both deposits of known equivalent age, corresponding to a ca. 50-100 ka humid interval prior to the beta-Tulu Bor eruption ca. 3.40 Ma, when the Lokochot Lake occupied part of the Turkana Basin. Molecular abundance distributions indicate that long chain n-alkanoic acids in marine sediments are the most reliable proxy for terrestrial vegetation (Carbon Preference Index, CPI = 4.5), with more cautious interpretation needed for n-alkanes and lacustrine archives. Marine sediments record carbon isotopic variability in terrestrial biomarkers of 2-3 parts per thousand, roughly equivalent to 20% variability in the C-3/C-4 vegetation contribution. The proportion of C-4 vegetation apparently increased at times of low terrigenous dust input. Terrestrial sediments reveal much larger (2-10 parts per thousand) shifts in n-alkanoic acid delta C-13 values. However, molecular abundance and isotopic composition suggest that microbial sources may also contribute fatty acids, contaminating the lacustrine sedimentary record of terrestrial vegetation.

C	Brown, N			IEEE Comp Soc	Brown, Nick			Accelerating advection for atmospheric modelling on Xilinx and Intel FPGAs	2021 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CLUSTER COMPUTING (CLUSTER 2021)	IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing				IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing (Cluster)	SEP 07-10, 2021	ELECTR NETWORK	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc				Reconfigurable architectures, such as FPGAs, execute code at the electronics level, avoiding assumptions imposed by the general purpose black-box micro-architectures of CPUs and GPUs. Such tailored execution can result in increased performance and power efficiency, and as the HPC community moves towards exascale an important question is the role these hardware technologies can play in future supercomputers. In this paper we explore the porting of the PW advection kernel, an important code component used in a variety of atmospheric simulations and accounting for around 40% of the runtime of the popular Met Office NERC Cloud model (MONC). Building upon previous work which ported this kernel to an older generation of Xilinx FPGA, we target latest generation Xilinx Alveo U280 and Intel Stratix 10 FPGAs. Designing around the abstraction of an Application Specific Dataflow Machine (ASDM), we develop a design which is performance portable between vendors and explore implementation differences between the tool chains and compare kernel performance between FPGA hardware. This is followed by a more general performance comparison, scaling up the number of kernels on the Xilinx Alveo and Intel Stratix 10, against a 24 core Xeon Platinum Cascade Lake CPU and NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU. When overlapping the transfer of data to and from the boards with compute, the FPGA solutions considerably outperform the CPU and, whilst falling short of the GPU in terms of performance, demonstrate power usage benefits, with the Alveo being especially power efficient. The result of this work is a comparison and set of design techniques that apply both to this specific atmospheric advection kernel on Xilinx and Intel FPGAs, and that are also of interest more widely when looking to accelerate HPC codes on a variety of reconfigurable architectures.

This international biomedical and health informatics workshop was created to share knowledge and explore issues in biomedical health informatics (BHI). Objective: The goal of this paper is to summarize the discussions of biomedical and health informatics graduate students who were asked to define interoperability, and make critical observations to gather insight on how to improve biomedical education. Methods: Students were assigned to one of four groups and asked to define interoperability and explore potential solutions to current problems of interoperability in health care. Results: We summarize here the student reports on the importance and possible solutions to the "interoperability problem" in biomedical informatics. Reports are provided from each of the four groups of highly qualified graduate students from leading BHI programs in the US, Europe and Asia. Conclusion: International workshops such as IPHIE provide a unique opportunity for graduate student learning and knowledge sharing. BHI faculty are encouraged to incorporate into their curriculum opportunities to exercise and strengthen student critical thinking to prepare our students for solving health informatics problems in the future.					van Mens, Hugo J.

Late Pleistocene ages for the most recent volcanism and glacial-pluvial deposits at Big Pine volcanic field, California, USA, from cosmogenic 36Cl dating	GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS												The Big Pine volcanic field is one of several Quaternary volcanic fields that poses a potential volcanic hazard along the tectonically active Owens Valley of east-central California, and whose lavas are interbedded with deposits from Pleistocene glaciations in the Sierra Nevada Range. Previous geochronology indicates an similar to 1.2 Ma history of volcanism, but the eruption ages and distribution of volcanic products associated with the most-recent eruptions have been poorly resolved. To delimit the timing and products of the youngest volcanism, we combine field mapping and cosmogenic Cl-36 dating of basaltic lava flows in the area where lavas with youthful morphology and well-preserved flow structures are concentrated. Field mapping and petrology reveal approximately 15 vents and 6 principal flow units with variable geochemical composition and mineralogy. Cosmogenic Cl-36 exposure ages for lava flow units from the top, middle, and bottom of the volcanic stratigraphy indicate eruptions at similar to 17, 27, and 40 ka, revealing several different and previously unrecognized episodes of late Pleistocene volcanism. Olivine to plagioclase-pyroxene phyric basalt erupted from several vents during the most recent episode of volcanism at similar to 17 ka, and produced a lava flow field covering similar to 35 km(2). The late Pleistocene Cl-36 exposure ages indicate that moraine and pluvial shoreline deposits that overlie or modify the youngest Big Pine lavas reflect Tioga stage glaciation in the Sierra Nevada and the shore of paleo-Owens Lake during the last glacial cycle.

OPTIMIZATION OF SALT CRYSTALLIZATION PROCESS BY SOLAR ENERGY WITH THE USE OF MIRROR REFLECTION, CASE OF CHOTT MEROUANE EL-OUED (SOUTH EAST OF ALGERIA)	MINING OF MINERAL DEPOSITS												Purpose. This paper aims to improve the harvesting conditions of the crystallized salt layer of the Salins Merouane El Meghaier (SME) - South East of Algeria, by creating favorable conditions for means of harvesting (harvesters), thanks to the acceleration of evaporation-crystallization process of salt by using an installation of flat mirrors, which reflect solar radiation towards the evaporating surface. Methods. To achieve the objectives, a stall installation contains pans equipped with different mirror surfaces. Compared with other designs, this test unit is installed near the Chott during the months of December and January. Findings. The optimization rate of salt evaporation-crystallization process depends on the surface of the reflection mirror used, which allows obtaining a layer of soft salt easy to harvest during the winter months. Originality. The use of mirrors reflecting solar radiation in salt pans of the unit in Salins Merouane El Meghaier enables to improve the salt exploitation conditions in quantitative, qualitative and economic terms, and to minimize the occupation of agriculture area. Practical implications. The exploitation of solar energy for salt production at the unit in Salins Merouane El Meghaier represents a free source, which is inexhaustible and produces no harmful impact on the environment.

Evaluating the efficacy of ecological restoration of fish habitat in coastal waters of Lake Ontario	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Ecological restoration is a common strategy applied to degraded wetlands and tributaries in large lakes. As resources are typically limited for restoration, it is essential to ensure that such efforts achieve associated goals. Using both discrete and continuous methods, we evaluated the efficacy of ecological restoration efforts on fish habitat within Canada's largest city, Toronto (Cell 2 and Embayment D of Tommy Thompson Park) relative to a control site (Toronto Islands). First, we used a long-term electrofishing dataset (i.e., discrete) to examine catch and community composition relative to restoration status. Catch for northern pike ( Esox lucius) ) remained constant at both restoration sites, and catch of invasive common carp ( Cyprinus carpio) ) decreased at Embayment D, indicating that exclusion barriers may be effective. Restoration was less effective for largemouth bass ( Micro- pterus nigricans) ) as catches remained similar after restoration at Cell 2, but decreased within Embayment D. We also found that relative abundance for coldwater species at both restoration sites decreased post-restoration, with increases in warmwater species at Cell 2 and coolwater species at Embayment D. Next, we used a long-term acoustic telemetry dataset (i.e., continuous sampling) with three focal species: largemouth bass, northern pike, and invasive common carp. Based on telemetry, we found that restoration efficacy was species-specific, with largemouth bass present before and after ecological restoration (particularly in spring, which may be					Cooke, Steven/F-4193-2010	Cooke, Steven/0000-0002-5407-0659													0048-9697	1879-1026				NOV 25	2024	953								176088	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.176088	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.176088		SEP 2024						39260511					WOS:001332893100001
J	López, P; Marcé, R; Armengol, J				Lopez, Pilar; Marce, Rafael; Armengol, Joan			Net heterotrophy and CO2 evasion from a productive calcareous reservoir: Adding complexity to the metabolism-CO2 evasion issue	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												The role of lacustrine systems in the global carbon cycle is a major topic in freshwater research. Most lakes release inorganic carbon to the atmosphere owing to the imbalance of net metabolism toward respiration. Most research on this topic relies on data collected in natural low-alkalinity lakes, and it therefore remains unclear what role human-made calcareous lakes play in the current paradigm. In this study, we reported inorganic carbon fluxes and net ecosystem production in a calcareous human-made reservoir in Spain using mass balances of inorganic carbon and dissolved oxygen. The inorganic carbon loadings reported are among the largest found in the literature, and the inorganic carbon pool in the reservoir depends on the net hydrological balance. The reservoir was identified as a net emitter of carbon dioxide (CO2) and showed persistent net heterotrophy, although we could not find any clear dependence of CO2 emissions on the metabolic balance. The variability of inorganic carbon and the net ecosystem production were poorly correlated, suggesting that additional internal processes govern the transformation of the dissolved inorganic carbon in the water column. Considering the significant decrease in surface alkalinity occurring during the summer, carbonate precipitation may be the dominant process confounding the relationship between metabolism and inorganic carbon variability. These results indicate that the CO2 dynamics may be weakly coupled to net metabolism in calcareous systems and that net heterotrophy may occur simultaneously with eutrophic conditions and low dissolved organic carbon concentration in flushed systems such as reservoirs.

Phytoplankton communities and antecedent conditions: high resolution sampling in Esthwaite Water	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The succession of a phytoplankton community was investigated through an intensive period of sampling and related to physical, chemical and biological conditions sampled at an equal, or higher, temporal resolution. 2. Phytoplankton samples were taken on a weekly basis from June to September 2004 and analysed for diversity, species composition, and contribution of different functional groups to total biomass. Physical and chemical data were collected on the sampling days, and physical environmental factors were also logged continuously throughout the period by automatic measuring stations. This continuous logging allowed community structure to be compared with physical data averaged over periods from a day to a week before each sampling date. 3. The Schmidt stability of the lake, a measure of the strength of stratification calculated from thermal data, showed a negative correlation with phytoplankton species diversity. This is consistent with the hypothesis that mixing was preventing exclusion by species that would otherwise dominate in stratified conditions. 4. At a functional level, stress tolerant (S-type) species dominated during the stratified summer conditions, with small, colonising species (C types) and ruderal, disturbance tolerant species (R types) contributing little to the overall biomass. Of the stress tolerant species, the faster growing (S-C) phytoplankters were significantly favoured by more stable, stratified conditions and higher solar radiation. Increased abundance of this group resulted in decreased species diversity. Correlations were generally strongest when using the 6- to 7-day averaged physical data, stressing the importance of continuous measurements of these drivers in phytoplankton studies.

Microcystin accumulation in Sportfish from an agricultural reservoir differs among feeding guild, tissue type, and time of sampling	AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY												Cyanobacterial blooms sometimes create secondary metabolites that can be transferred between trophic levels and accumulate in fish, but little is known about what time of year fish are most susceptible. Here, we examine microcystin in the muscle, liver, and kidney of bluegill and largemouth bass from an agricultural reservoir over 12 months. We identify which fish characteristics and water parameters best explain microcystin accumulation in fish tissues. Microcystin in bluegill was significantly higher than largemouth bass. In both species, microcystin was highest in livers (bluegill mean = 57.6 ng g -1, largemouth bass mean = 71.8 ng g -1 wet weight [ww]), then kidneys (bluegill mean = 27.1, largemouth bass mean = 22.7 ng g -1 ww), followed by muscles (bluegill mean = 7.6, largemouth bass mean = 5.7 ng g -1 ww). Adult bluegill feed on benthic macroinvertebrates and zooplankton, which may explain their higher microcystin concentrations compared to largemouth bass, which are primarily piscivorous. Harvest date emerged as the best predictor of microcystin in muscles and kidneys, with the highest concentrations occurring in April. Microcystin in water also emerged as a significant predictor, albeit much lower than harvest date, suggesting that low but persistent microcystin concentrations in water may result in accumulation of this cyanotoxin in fish. This study is the first to examine microcystin in fish from the North American Great Plains and one of only 5 studies that investigate microcystin in bluegill and largemouth bass. Additional investigation into the relationship between cyanobacteria and fish health is warranted, especially during spring when fish microcystin concentrations were highest.					; Whittier, Jodi/V-3683-2019; Argerich, Alba/A-6297-2011; Whittier, Joanna/V-3683-2019	North, Rebecca/0000-0003-3762-5939; Argerich, Alba/0000-0001-6430-0449; Whittier, Joanna/0000-0002-1048-9490													0166-445X	1879-1514				SEP	2022	250								106242	10.1016/j.aquatox.2022.106242	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2022.106242		JUL 2022						35878488					WOS:000862720700006
J	Yuk, JH; Aoki, SI				Yuk, Jin-Hee; Aoki, Shin-Ichi			A study on process of water exchange in Inohana lake	COASTAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL												During the summer of 2005, we carried out an intensive field survey of current velocity, salinity, temperature, and water density in Inohana Lake, Japan, which is a semi-enclosed and highly strati field estuary. Field and meteorological data were used to investigate the characteristics of currents, and to estimate water-volume and salt fluxes as a measure of water and material exchanges. We undertook a test using a simple box model based on the average salinity and river discharge, and obtained the exchanges of waters between Inohana and Hamana Lakes and within Inohana Lake, respectively. In terms of water exchanges between the two lakes and within Inohana Lake, wind effects were dominant over tide. In terms of water exchange rate between the two lakes, the water-volume flux was about five times as great as freshwater in flow. The water-volume flux between two lakes estimated from the box model showed good agreement with the observed ones by the ADCP. In the box model, the contribution of advection was larger than that of diffusion for the vertical water exchange. The vertical salt flux was estimated using two methods: the direct estimation from field data and a turbulent diffusion model. The turbulent diffusion model showed good agreement with the direct estimation by removing fluctuations with frequency less than 0.2 Hz from the velocity and salinity data.																			2166-4250	1793-6292				MAR	2008	50	1					1	18		10.1142/S0578563408001740	http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0578563408001740													WOS:000253752900001

Chronology of the lost glacial maximum in the upper bear river basin, Utah	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH					Uinta Interdisciplinary Assessment Symposium (UINTAS 2006)	MAY, 2006	Snowbird, UT					The headwaters of the Bear River drainage were occupied during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) by outlet glaciers of the Western Uinta Ice Field, an extensive ice mass (similar to 685 km(2)) that covered the western slope of the Uinta Mountains. A well-preserved sequence of latero-frontal moraines in the drainage indicates that outlet glaciers advanced beyond the mountain front and coalesced on the piedmont. Glacial deposits in the Bear River drainage provide a unique setting where both Be-10 C-14 dating of sediment cosmogenic surface-expo sure dating of moraine boulders and in Bear Lake downstream of the glaciated area set age limits on the timing of glaciation. Limiting C-14 ages of glacial flour in Bear Lake (corrected to calendar years using CALIB 5.0) indicate that ice advance began at 32 ka and culminated at about 24 ka. Based on a Bayesian statistical analysis of cosmogenic surface-expo sure ages from two areas on the terminal moraine complex, the Bear River glacier began approximately coincident with the start of its final retreat at about 18.7 to 18.1 ka, deglaciation elsewhere in the central Rocky Mountains and many other alpine glacial localities worldwide. Unlike valleys of the southwestern Uinta Mountains, deglaciation of the Bear River drainage began prior to the hydrologic fall of Lake Bonneville from the Provo shoreline at about 16 ka.

Hepatic oxidative stress and neurotoxicity in Pelophylax kl. esculentus frogs: Influence of long-term exposure to a cyanobacterial bloom	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Although the long-term exposure of aquatic organisms to cyanobacterial blooms is a regular occurrence in the environment, the prooxidant and neurotoxic effects of such conditions are still insufficiently investigated in situ. We examined the temporal dynamics of the biochemical parameters in the liver of Pelophylax kl. esculentus frogs that inhabit the northern (N) side of Lake Ludas (Serbia) with microcystins (MCs) produced in a cyanobacterial bloom over three summer months. The obtained data were compared with data on frogs that live on the southern (S), MC-free side of the same lake. Our results showed that the MC-producing bloom induced oxidative damage to proteins and lipids, observed as a decrease in the concentration of protein -SH groups and increased lipid peroxidation (LPO) in the liver of N frogs in comparison to S frogs. Glutathione (GSH) played a key role in the transient defense against the MC-induced development of LPO. The low glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity detected in all groups of frogs from the N site was crucial for the observed prooxidant consequences. The bloom impaired cholinergic homeostasis as a result of a decrease in ChE activity. A delayed neurotoxic effect in relation to the prooxidant outcomes was observed. Our results also showed that even though the integrated biomarker response (IBR) of the antioxidant biomarkers increased during exposure, the individual biochemical parameters did not exhibit a well-defined time-dependent pattern because of specific adaptation dynamics and/or additional effects of the physicochemical parameters of the water. This comprehensive environmental ecotoxicological evaluation of the cyanobacterial bloom-induced biochemical alterations in the liver of frogs provides a new basis for further investigations of the prolonged, real-life ecotoxicity of the blooms.

S	He, TR; Feng, XB		Han, BP; Liu, ZW		He, Tianrong; Feng, Xinbin			Biogeochemical Cycling of Mercury in Hongfeng Reservoir, Guizhou, China	TROPICAL AND SUB-TROPICAL RESERVOIR LIMNOLOGY IN CHINA: THEORY AND PRACTICE	Monographiae Biologicae											Mercury accumulation in aquatic food chains is a global public health concern because of the dangers of human exposure to methylmercury. Hongfeng reservoir, situated in Guizhou Province, southwestern China, is a water body that suffers from mercury pollution. Its source of mercury is anthropogenic and mainly includes industrial discharge from coal-tired power plants, chemical plants using mercury as a catalyst, and atmospheric deposition. Here, we report on the temporal and spatial distribution of different mercury species in the water of the reservoir and analyze possible effects of eutrophication on the biogeochemical cycling of mercury. Hyper-eutrophication of the reservoir affected the concentration and distribution of mercury species in the water through algal blooms. Microalgae have a large capacity to bind mercury, and represent a substantial pool of mercury in the aquatic system. Hyper-eutrophication results in low DO and high DOC that accelerates the formation of MeHg in the hypolimnion, especially in summer. Hongfeng reservoir is a large net sink of total mercury and a net source of MeHg. The mercury cycling at the sediment water surface indicates that sediment dominates the fate of both total mercury and methylmercury, but the fluxes of mercury diffusing from pore water contribute only weakly to mercury in water. The MeHg-enriched water discharged from the anoxic hypolimnion poses a serious risk to downstream ecosystems.

We developed an approach for assessing vulnerability of urban tree species and cultivars commonly planted in cities in the United States Upper Midwest to current and projected climate change through the end of the 21st century. One hundred seventy-eight tree species were evaluated for their adaptive capacity to a suite of current and future-projected climate and urban stressors using a weighted scoring system based on an extensive literature review. These scores were then evaluated and adjusted by leading experts in arboriculture in the region. Each species or cultivar's USDA Hardiness Zone and American Horticultural Society Heat Zone tolerance was compared to current and future heat and hardiness zones for 14 municipalities across Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota using statistically downscaled climate data. Species adaptive capacity and zone tolerance was combined to assign each species one of five vulnerability categories for each location. We determined the number of species and trees in each category based on the most recent municipal street tree data for each location. Under a scenario of less climate change (RCP 4.5), fewer than 2% of trees in each municipality were considered highly vulnerable across all 14 municipalities. Under a scenario of greater change (RCP 8.5), upward of 25% of trees were considered highly vulnerable in some locations. However, the number of vulnerable trees varied greatly by location, primarily because of differences in projected summer high temperatures rather than differences in species composition. Urban foresters can use this information as a complement to other more traditional considerations used when selecting trees for planting.																			2296-701X					SEP 29	2021	9								721831	10.3389/fevo.2021.721831	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2021.721831													WOS:000708327100001

Anticipated impacts of climate change on 21st century Maumee River discharge and nutrient loads	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Climate change holds great potential to affect the Lake Erie ecosystem by altering the timing and magnitude of precipitation driven river discharge and nutrient runoff in its highly agricultural watershed. Using the SWAT hydrologic model and an ensemble of global climate models, we predicted Maumee River (Ohio) discharge during the 21st century under two Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) greenhouse gas emissions scenarios: RCP4.5 (mid-range, moderate reductions) and RCP8.5 (high, "business as usual"). Annual discharge was projected to increase under both scenarios, both in the near-century (RCP4.5 = 6.5%; RCP8.5 = 2.0%) and late-century (RCP4.5 = 9.2%; RCP8.5 = 15.9%), owing to increased precipitation and reduced plant stomatal conductance. Holding fertilizer application rates at baseline levels, we found that reduced winter surface runoff and increased plant phosphorus (P) uptake led to a respective decrease in annual total P (TP) runoff in the near century (RCP4.5 = -4.3%; RCP8.5 = -6.6%) and by the late-century (RCP4.5 = -14.6%; RCP8.5 = -7.8%). Likewise, soluble reactive P (SRP) runoff was predicted to decrease under both scenarios in the near-century (RCP4.5 = -0.5%; RCP8.5 = -3.5%) and by the late-century (RCP4.5 = -11.8%; RCP8.5 = -8.6%). By contrast, when fertilizer application was modeled to increase at the same rate as plant P uptake, TP loading increased 4.0% (0.9%) in the near-century and 9.9% (24.6%) by the late-century and SRP loading increased 10.5% (6.1%) in the near-century and 26.7% (42.0%) by the late-century under RCP4.5 (RCP8.5). Our findings suggest that changes in agricultural practices (e.g., fertilization rates) will be key determinants of Maumee River discharge during the 21st century.

Whole-basin changes in Hg accumulation, determined from lakewide arrays of(210)Pb-dated cores, show that regional atmospheric Hg deposition has increased by a factor of 3.7 since preindustrial times. The relatitve increase is consistent among lakes, although preindustrial Hg accumulation rates range front 4.5 to 9 mu g/m(2) per year, and modern rates range from 16 to 32 mu g/m(2) per year. The distribution of these rates is highly correlated with the ratio of catchment area to the lake surface area. Modern and preindustrial atmospheric deposition rates of 12.5 and 3.7 mu g/m(2) per year are calculated from this relationship, along with the relative contribution of Hg from the terrestrial catchment. Release of atmospheric Hg from catchment soils accounts for 20-40% of the Hg lending to the lakes, depending on catchment size. This export represents about 25% of the atmospheric Hg falling on the catchments under both modern and preindustrial conditions. The absence of geographic trends in either Hg deposition rates or their increase implies regional if not global sources for the Hg entering these lakes.					; Brezonik, Patrick/ISV-2988-2023	Swain, Edward/0000-0002-0487-9732; Brigham, Mark/0000-0001-7412-6800; Engstrom, Daniel/0000-0002-8066-029X; 													0065-2393		0-8412-2526-5				1994	237						33	66																WOS:A1994BZ52H00002

The collection included samples from eight fish groups (Arctic char, crab, mussels, oysters, salmon, shrimp, tilapia, trout) from the wild and those raised on fish farms, as available. Sample collection included both domestic and imported fish products, however, no significant difference in residue levels was observed between these groups of fish products. Salmon samples were found to contain the highest concentration of Sigma PCBs (geometric mean 12.9 ng/g wet weight), while crab samples had greatest Sigma PCDD/F levels (geometric mean 0.002 ng/g wet weight). The geometric mean of the total toxic equivalents (WHO-TEQ) ranged from 0.06 pg WHO-TEQ/g whole weight in farmed shrimp to 1.1 pg WHO-TEQ/g whole weight in fanned salmon samples. PCB 153, 138, 118 and 101 were the dominant congeners observed in fish product samples studied, while 1,2,3,7,8-pentachlorodibenzodioxin and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofuran contributed the most to total PCDD and PCDF loadings. Lipid content was positively correlated to Sigma PCB levels; however, no relationship between lipid content and Sigma PCDD/F concentrations was established. Sigma PCB levels were below the Canadian guideline value for PCBs in fish and fish products (2000 ng/g). Similarly, 2,3,7,8-TCDD levels in all fish products were below the Canadian guideline value (0.020 ng/g). Crown Copyright (C) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Methane oxidation potentials were measured for 0.5-cm layers down to 1.5 cm and found to be relatively constant at 270 to 350 mu mol/liter of sediment/h, Approximately 65% of the methane was oxidized to cell material or metabolites, a signature suggestive of type I methanotrophs. Eleven methanotroph strains were isolated from the lake sediment and analyzed. Five of these strains classed as type I, while six were classed as type II strains by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Southern hybridization analysis with oligonucleotide probes detected, on average, one to two copies of pmoA and one to three copies of 16S rRNA genes. Only one restriction length polymorphism pattern was shown for pmoA genes in each isolate, and in cases where, sequencing was done, the pmoA copies were found to be almost identical. PCR primers were developed for mmoX which amplified 1.2-kb regions from all six strains that tested positive for cytoplasmic soluble methane mono-oxygenase (sMMO) activity. Phylogenetic analysis of the translated PCR products with published mmoX sequences showed that MmoX falls into two distinct clusters, one containing the orthologs from type I strains and another containing the orthologs from type II strains. The presence of sMMO-containing Methylomonas strains in a pristine freshwater lake environment suggests that these methanotrophs are more widespread than has been previously thought.																			0099-2240					DEC	2000	66	12					5259	5266		10.1128/AEM.66.12.5259-5266.2000	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.66.12.5259-5266.2000								11097900					WOS:000167112400026
J	Moss, B; Carvalho, L; Plewes, J				Moss, B; Carvalho, L; Plewes, J			The lake at Llandrindod Wells - a restoration comedy?	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												1. The lake at Llandrindod Wells, Wales, UK, is a typical urban shallow lake. Created in the 19th century for amenity, it has a long history of management for various, often conflicting, purposes. After the 1950s, the once clear water became turbid with phytoplankton, and aquatic plants became very scarce. 2. The most likely reason for this was introduction of common carp, for angling, into a fish community that contained no piscivores. Mobilization of phosphorus from the sediments by activities of the fish led to severe internal phosphorus loading, culminating ultimately in a requirement to close the lake, temporarily in summer, to water contact activities, because of a risk of toxic cyanophyte blooms. 3. The lake-owners decided to restore the lake to greater amenity and conservation value by biomanipulation of the fish community and associated works. The restoration was successful in restoring clear water and plant communities, but because of the nature of the plants reintroduced, there were new problems of dense plant growth, Ownership of the lake then changed and, in a somewhat confused situation, the lake has been returned to a carp fishery. 4. Documents on the history of management of the lake, and available limnological data, are reviewed in relation to a general strategy for lake restoration and general lessons are drawn for future restoration projects.

We used anuran calling surveys to investigate the association between 5 anuran species and habitat variables measured within 100, 500, 1000, and 3000 m of sampling points at 63 coastal wetlands along the US shores of Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. Stepwise logistic regression was used to create predictive models for each species at each spatial scale. Our results confirm the view that habitat variables at multiple scales influence frog distributions, but the strength of predictive models was significantly affected by the spatial scale at which habitat variables were derived. Remotely sensed habitat variables within a 3000 m radius were among the most effective predictors of occurrence for American toad (Bufo americanus), eastern gray treefrog (Hyla versicolor), spring peeper (Pseudacris crucifer), and green frog (Rana clamitans melanota). The western chorus frog (Pseudacris triseriata) was predicted most effectively by variables derived within a 500 m radius. For the most part, these anurans exhibited species-specific responses to habitat variables; however the suite of landscape-scale variables associated with urban land use appeared in all species' regression models. Associations with landscape-scale variables coupled with well-documented habitat needs at local breeding sites suggest that conservation and assessment of frogs and toads in coastal wetlands should consider the influence of habitat variables at multiple spatial scales.																			0921-2973	1572-9761				MAY	2005	20	4					441	454		10.1007/s10980-004-3167-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10980-004-3167-6													WOS:000233035100006

Recent Cladocera (Branchiopoda, Crustacea) in the Taphocenoses of Lakes of the Pechora River Delta (Russia)	UCHENYE ZAPISKI KAZANSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-SERIYA ESTESTVENNYE NAUKI												This paper presents the results of the hydrochemical, hydrobiological, and paleolimnological studies of 17 Arctic lakes in the Pechora River delta. Water samples and surface sediments were collected during the 2020 summer expedition to the Nenets State Nature Reserve. Based on the chemical composition of their waters, the studied lakes belong to the chloride class, sodium group II. Overall, they are characterized by shallow depths typical of this region, low mineralization (below 200 mg/L) and water hardness, as well as high dissolved oxygen levels. To assess the ecological status of the lakes, cladocerans and their subfossil remains, which have been widely recognized as reliable indicators for tracking long-term changes in the development of freshwater ecosystems, were analyzed. A total of 23 cladoceran taxa were identified. The dominant species were Bosmina longispina (Leydig, 1860) and Chydorus cf. sphaericus (Muller, 1776) - either of these species, often displacing each other, prevailed in the lakes. Other cladoceran species were low-abundant and found sporadically: Sida crystallina (Muller, 1776), Pleuroxus uncinatus (Baird, 1850), Coronatella rectangula (Sars, 1862), and Bythotrephes longimanus (Leydig, 1860). The study also reports the first finding of Rhynchotalona latens (Sarmaja-Korjonen, Hakojarvi and Korhola, 2000), a rare glacial relict species with a narrow distribution range, in this region of Russia. The zoogeographical analysis of the data obtained on the identified taxa showed that species typical of the Palearctic and Holarctic zones prevail in the cladoceran communities under study.

The aim of this study was to identify either grounded ice or floating ice using ground penetrating radar (GPR) and analyze the factors that influence identification. Densely spaced GPR measurements were collected using a pair of 900 MHz antennas in a thermokarst lake on the northeast Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Numerical simulations were used to evaluate the factors that influence the accuracy and reliability of the GPR detection. Results show that the ice thickness was less than 1.0 m and indicated a spatial difference on the lake. The normalized amplitudes of reflected waves (NAR) were used for discriminating the grounded ice and floating ice. The floating ice was identified by high NAR (higher than 0.3), and the grounded ice was discriminated by low NAR (lower than 0.2). Numerical simulations showed that the sandwiched thin water and frozen sediment layer beneath the lake ice can smooth the amplitude contrasts between the grounded ice and floating ice. The air/water bubbles in ice and undulating ice bottom interfaces scatter the reflection amplitudes significantly. The factors that influence the GPR reflection amplitudes apart from the permittivity contrasts, can lead to notable uncertainties in identifying grounded and floating ice based on NAR.																			0165-232X	1872-7441				OCT	2018	154						1	8		10.1016/j.coldregions.2018.06.008	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.coldregions.2018.06.008													WOS:000441870100001
J	Forman, SL; Pierson, J				Forman, SL; Pierson, J			Formation of linear and parabolic dunes on the eastern Snake River Plain, Idaho in the nineteenth century	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Geomorphic and stratigraphic evidence show periods of distinct hydrologic excess and deficit sometime in the past 500 years on the eastern Snake River Plain. Natural exposures at the current shore of Mud Lake contain a lacustrine silty sand beneath eolian sands; the latter deposit is expressed at the surface as hairpin parabolic and linear dunes. These dunes can be traced into and across lakes, a clear sign of recent aridity. Two shallow-water gastropods and two wood fragments from the lacustrine silty sand yield the respective AMS C-14 ages of ca. 705 and 988 year BP, and 195 and 305 year BP. The offset in ages indicates a lake hard-water effect of aquatic gastropods, with the wood ages providing the closest age constraint. Optically stimulated luminescence single aliquot regeneration ages of 150 +/- 30 and 120 +/- 20 year BP on quartz grains from the overlying eolian sands further constrains a drop in lake level and subsequent aridity to the 19th century. This lacustrine-dune sequence is probably the geomorphic expression of a distinct wet period followed by a severe drought between AD 1845 and 1856, which has been documented in the dendroclimatic records for the Rocky Mountains and the western Great Plains. Lake fluctuations and dune formation is associated with greater subdecadal variability in spring precipitation, than recorded in the past 100 years. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Kirby, E; Burbank, DW; Reheis, M; Phillips, F				Kirby, Eric; Burbank, Douglas W.; Reheis, Marith; Phillips, Fred			Temporal variations in slip rate of the White Mountain Fault Zone, Eastern California	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												The evolution of fault slip through time may yield insight into the geodynamics of deforming lithosphere. Precise determination of temporal variations in fault slip is often hindered, however, by a dearth of markers of varying age from which to reconstruct fault slip. Here we determine slip rates across the White Mountain Fault Zone over the past ca. 0.8 Ma from displaced alluvial deposits preserved along the flank of the White Mountains. Displacement histories inferred from deposits containing the similar to 760 ka Bishop Tuff contrast strongly with those inferred from Late Pleistocene alluvial fans dated by cosmogenic Cl-36, indicating that the fault has experienced significant temporal variations in slip rate. Oblique-slip rates over the past similar to 760 ky are determined to have been > 0.9 m/ky parallel to a net slip vector plunging shallowly (< 20 degrees) toward 340 degrees-350 degrees. Displacement of markers in Late Pleistocene alluvial deposits, in contrast, yield slip rates between 0.3 and 0.4 m/ky parallel to a vector plunging somewhat more steeply (20 degrees-40 degrees) toward 320 degrees-340 degrees. These variations in slip rate appear to have operated over timescales > ca. 70 ky, yet occurred on a well-established fault system. Moreover, the timing and magnitude of slip rate variation mimics behavior documented for the northern Fish Lake Valley fault zone. Together, our data provide evidence for coordinated slip rate variations across the Eastern California Shear Zone during the Pleistocene. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

J	Haberyan, KA; Horn, SP				Haberyan, KA; Horn, SP			Diatom paleoecology of Laguna Zoncho, Costa Rica	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												We analyzed diatoms in a sediment pro. le from Laguna Zoncho in southern Pacific Costa Rica ( lake elevation 1190 m asl, depth 2.6 m, area 0.75 ha) spanning some 3240 cal yr. Diatoms are common in the pro. le, which we subdivide into three zones. Zone C (similar to 3240 - 1020 cal yr B. P.) is dominated by Staurosira construens var. venter and Aulacoseira spp.; during this time, the lake was dilute and circumneutral. Benthic and acidophilous taxa increase gradually in the upper section of this zone. Zone B (similar to 1020 - 460 cal yr B. P.) almost totally lacks Aulacoseira, and instead is dominated by combinations of Eunotia minor, Encyonema lunatum, Gomphonema gracile, and Pinnularia braunii. Previous pollen and charcoal analysis indicates that this zone falls within the peak of prehistoric agricultural activity at the lake, but diatoms may also reflect climate change. During this period, the lake was likely shallower and more acidic, but not eutrophic. Finally, Zone A (similar to 460 cal yr B. P. to AD 1997) begins near a 1.5-cm tephra layer from nearby Volcan Baru; diatom assemblages are dominated by Aulacoseira spp., and suggest deepening of the lake and return to conditions similar to Zone C. This was a time of indigenous population decline and forest recovery in the Zoncho region, probably reflecting the impact of European diseases on the native population, although climate change and impacts of the tephra deposition cannot be wholly discounted.					; Horn, Sally/B-1918-2013	Horn, Sally/0000-0002-0575-3664; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				APR	2005	33	3					361	369		10.1007/s10933-004-6789-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-004-6789-4													WOS:000227704300008

These systems are open, dynamic and easily affected by climatic variations. Zn a recent report, Shrivastav et al. (Environ Mon Ass 1996;40:271-278) have suggested the use of bricks as a geochemical monitor of heavy metal fallout and their study has clearly demonstrated the practical feasibility of the above concept at least in some parts of the world. However, more research is required in order to understand the suitability of using bricks as a geochemical monitor of heavy metal fallout. As part of our continuing research in this direction, in this article we report on the history of heavy metal pollution in the soils of Agra since 1900, that have been traced by analysing bricks of different ages collected from the old buildings/monuments. The study indicated that the soil concentrations of lead, zinc and chromium rose initially until between 1950 and 1960 and then fell sharply especially over the last 2-3 decades, which can be explained as an outcome of socio-economic fluctuations on a local scale and climatic changes on a global or regional scale.

Two additional fish were taken from the Fraser River near Williams Lake, some 250 km downstream of Prince George. Samples of white muscle, red muscle, liver, and roe were analyzed for metals, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), non-ortho and mono-ortho polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and chlorophenols to determine whether the tissues of this species were acceptable for human consumption. The concentrations of mercury in the white muscle and liver of several fish from the upper Fraser River exceeded the provincial tissue residue criteria for people who consumed low quantities of fish (i.e., 210 g wet weight/week). The concentrations of PCDDs, PCDFs, and coplanar PCBs (expressed as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin toxic equivalents) in red muscle and liver of these fish exceeded the Health Canada working guidelines for the protection of human health. By comparison, white sturgeon collected in the lower Fraser River had much lower concentrations of metals and organic contaminants. The differences in contaminant burdens in fish from the two widely separated reaches of the river reflect their proximity to or distance from known contaminant sources.

J	Liu, YX; Ke, YH; Wu, H; Zhang, CL; Chen, XW				Liu, Yongxin; Ke, Yinghai; Wu, Huan; Zhang, Chenlu; Chen, Xiuwan			A satellite-based hybrid model for trophic state evaluation in inland waters across China	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Eutrophication is one of the major threats to the inland water ecosystem. Satellite remote sensing provides a promising way to monitor trophic state at large spatial scale in an efficient manner. Currently, most satellitebased trophic state evaluation approaches have focused on water quality parameters retrieval (e.g., transparency, chlorophyll-a), based on which trophic state was evaluated. However, the retrieval accuracies of individual parameter do not meet the demand for accurate trophic state evaluation, especially for the turbid inland waters. In this study, we proposed a novel hybrid model to estimate trophic state index (TSI) by integrating multiple spectral indices associated with different eutrophication level based on Sentinel-2 imagery. The TSI estimated by the proposed method agreed well with the in-situ TSI observations, with root mean square error (RMSE) of 6.93 and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 13.77%. Compared with the independent observations from Ministry of Ecology and Environment, the estimated monthly TSI also showed good consistency (RMSE = 5.91,MAPE = 10.66%). Furthermore, the congruent performance of the proposed method in the 11 sample lakes (RMSE = 5.91, MAPE = 10.66%) and the 51 ungauged lakes (RMSE = 7.16, MAPE = 11.56%) indicated the favorable model generalization. The proposed method was then applied to assess the trophic state of 352 permanent lakes and reservoirs across China during the summers of 2016-2021. It showed that 10%, 60%, 28%, and 2% of the lakes/reservoirs are in oligotrophic, mesotrophic, light eutrophic, and middle eutrophic states respectively. Eutrophic waters are concentrated in the Middle-and-Lower Yangtze Plain, the Northeast Plain, and the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau. Overall, this study improved the trophic state representativeness and revealed trophic state spatial distribution of Chinese inland waters, which has the significant meanings for aquatic environment protection and water resource management.					; Ke, Yinghai/AAQ-3645-2021; liu, yongsen/AHC-4166-2022	Zhang, Chenlu/0009-0006-9134-2859; Liu, Yongxin/0000-0002-5273-4503													0013-9351	1096-0953				MAY 15	2023	225								115509	10.1016/j.envres.2023.115509	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2023.115509		MAR 2023						36801233					WOS:000953137800001

Spatiotemporal Variation in the Magnitude of Reproduction by Invasive, Pelagically Spawning Carps in the Illinois Waterway	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												The relationship between the magnitude of reproduction and adult density of pelagically spawning carp (PSC) species (bigheaded carp Hypophthalmichthys spp., Grass Carp Ctenopharyngodon idella, and Black Carp Mylopharyngodon piceus) and the influence of environmental factors on this relationship are valuable information for management and control of these highly invasive cyprinids. Six years of standardized monitoring for PSC reproduction and adult density in navigation pools of the Illinois Waterway (IWW; the Illinois River and its connection to Lake Michigan through the Des Plaines River and Chicago Area Waterway System), in conjunction with removal efforts in the upper IWW, where there is limited fish movement between pools, provided an opportunity to deepen our understanding of factors affecting the reproductive productivity of this invasive assemblage. Reproductive activity most commonly occurred in May and June, with the magnitude of reproduction in June far exceeding that occurring in other months. The highest egg counts were found within a 72-km zone containing the hydromorphological transition between the upper and lower Illinois River, with the majority of PSC larval drift occurring below this zone in the lower Illinois River. Magnitude of reproduction increased nonlinearly with adult PSC density, declining at high adult densities. Annual egg counts were also higher in years that combined more variable spring discharge with higher accumulated degree-days through June. The density-dependent reproduction exhibited by PSC implies that any stock-recruitment variation observed for these species needs to be interpreted cautiously before being ascribed to environmental factors affecting survival from hatching to juvenile stages. An increased understanding of which life stages of PSC are subject to density dependence can refine projections of how these species respond to harvest and other control measures.

Management of minimum lake levels and impacts on flood mitigation: A case study of the Yahara Watershed, Wisconsin, USA	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Lake level regulation is commonly used to manage water resources and mitigate flood risk in watersheds with linked river-lake systems. In this study, we first assess exposure, in terms of both population and land area, to flooding impacts in the Yahara Watershed's chain of four lakes in southern Wisconsin as affected by minimum lake level management. A flooding exposure assessment shows that the areas surrounding the upstream lakes, Mendota and Monona, have dense urban areas with high populations that are exposed to flooding; Waubesa has low elevations along its lakeshore, resulting in a large potential flooding area; and the most downstream lake, Kegonsa, has a large area of surrounding cropland that is exposed to flooding but impacts a limited population. We then use a linked modeling framework of a land surface model (Agro-IBIS) and a hydrologic-routing model (THMB) to simulate daily lake level over a study period of 1994-2013 in the Yahara Watershed with different minimum lake level management strategies. Modeling results show that the peak lake levels and corresponding exposed land area and population to flooding will decrease under a lower target minimum lake level. However, at the same time, the number of days that the lake level is below winter minimum will increase, which may adversely affect ecosystem health. In addition, our sensitivity analysis indicates that reducing target minimum lake levels will help mitigate flood risk in terms of both flood magnitude and frequency. Nevertheless, this must be balanced against the need to maintain adequately high lake levels for ecosystem services and recreational functions of the lakes.					; Zipper, Sam/B-8667-2013; Chen, Xi/AIB-6402-2022; Loheide, Steven/L-3132-2015	Booth, Eric/0000-0003-2191-6627; Zipper, Sam/0000-0002-8735-5757; Chen, Xi/0000-0002-0293-7417; Loheide, Steven/0000-0003-1897-0163													0022-1694	1879-2707				OCT	2019	577								123920	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.123920	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.123920													WOS:000488304300014
J	Li, D; Jiang, X; Zheng, BH				Li, Da; Jiang, Xia; Zheng, Binghui			Using δ15N and δ18O Signatures to Evaluate Nitrate Sources and Transformations in Four Inflowing Rivers, North of Taihu Lake	WATER												Taihu Lake is the third largest freshwater lake in China. Due to rapid economic development and excessive nutrient discharges, there is serious eutrophication in the northern part of the lake. Nitrogen (N) is one of the key factors for eutrophication in Taihu Lake, which mainly comes from the rivers around the lake. Samples from four inflowing rivers were analysed for delta N-15 and delta O-18 isotopes in December 2013 to identify the different sources of nitrogen in the northern part of Taihu Lake. The results indicated that the water quality in Taihu Lake was clearly influenced by the water quality of the inflowing rivers and nitrate (NO3--N) was the main component of the soluble inorganic nitrogen in water. The soil organic N represented more than 70% of the total NO3--N loads in the Zhihugang. Domestic sewage was the major NO3--N source in the Liangxi river, with a contribution of greater than 50%. Soil organic N and domestic sewage, with contributions of more than 30% and 35% respectively, were the major NO3--N sources in the Lihe river and Daxigang river. Denitrification might be responsible for the shifting delta N-15-NO3- and delta O-18-NO3- values in the Daxigang river, and a mixing process may play a major role in N transformations in the Lihe river in winter. The results of this study will be useful as reference values for reducing NO3- pollution in the inflowing rivers in the north of Taihu Lake.																			2073-4441					MAY	2017	9	5							345	10.3390/w9050345	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w9050345													WOS:000404558100045

THE GEOLOGY, PALAEONTOLOGY AND EVOLUTION OF THE ETOSHA PAN, NAMIBIA: IMPLICATIONS FOR TERMINAL KALAHARI DEPOSITION	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY												A mid to late Tertiary lake, Palaeolake Etosha, was the single collective end point of three drainage systems feeding southwards off the central Angolan highlands, the Cubango and Kunene Megafans and the Cuvelai Drainage System. The lake beds consist of 50 m of saline, olive green clay, the Etosha Pan Clay Member, containing authigenic analcime, monoclinic K-feldspar and glauconite. Fossil suites in two local sandstones near or at the top of the clay, the Oshigambo and Ekuma Delta Sandstone Members, include various antelope, pig, zebra, quagga, rhinoceros, elephant, lion, spring hare, ostrich, flamingo, crocodile, hippopotamus, freshwater turtles, catfish, bivalves and trees, which have respective ages of 6 +/- 1 Ma and 4 +/- 1 Ma. An oolitic, pan-margin limestone of limited lateral extent, the Poacher's Point Carbonate Member, was the last unit deposited in the palaeolake. Flooding and complete desiccation were common occurrences in Palaeolake Etosha before it dried up completely at about 4 Ma under conditions of progressively increasing aridity. Over the ensuing 2 Ma, a huge groundwater calcrete, the Etosha Calcrete Formation, advanced northwards over the dry lake deposits and the surface Kalahari sands were reworked to produce the regional Kalahari dune fields. Resumption of periodic flow in the Cuvelai system resulted in cycles of flooding and desiccation in an ephemeral Cuvelai endpoint lake atop the Etosha Calcrete Formation in the Etosha area. Fragmentation of the calcrete by salt enabled strong easterly winds to remove the calcrete fines from the Etosha depression. This initiated the 'excavation' of the present Etosha Pan by wind ablation. Lunette dunes on the western side of Etosha Pan contain an inverted pan stratigraphy. Flooding of the present pan occurs occasionally and has been as deep as 10 in in the past. White magadi-type chert nodules have formed locally on the pan floor in animal footprints.																			1012-0750	1996-8590				SEP	2010	113	3					307	334		10.2113/gssajg.113.3.307	http://dx.doi.org/10.2113/gssajg.113.3.307													WOS:000286031800004

The shortchain n-alkanes C15/16/17, likely derived from aquatic algae, plankton, and photosynthetic bacteria, dominate the n-alkane composition in this lake. This unusual distribution pattern might be attributed to the meromictic lake system that is characterized by a rapid salinity increase and an abrupt decrease in dissolved oxygen in the lake water with depth, as well as anoxic conditions at the bottom. n-Alkane indicator ratios (e. g. carbon preference index (CPI), average chain length (ACL), and aquatic/terrigenous ratio (ATR)) and dD values reveal that higher effective moisture availability at Zigetang Co occurred in the middle (5.8-2.7 cal. ka BP) rather than the early Holocene. This contradicts palaeoclimate records from neighboring lakes (e. g. Nam Co, Siling Co, and Paru Co). We suggest that in the Zigetang Co catchment where glacial meltwaters are not available, the temperature-induced evaporation would outweigh the monsoonal precipitation and, therefore, result in lower effective moisture displayed by the increasing dD values during the early Holocene. The local recycling of air masses could also have an important impact on the lake level and moisture availability and cannot be excluded. Our record provides further evidence for the complex relationship of insolation-induced temperature, evaporation, and precipitation affecting the regional climate changes on the Tibetan Plateau.

The Qaidam Basin (QB) in western China is a typical inland evaporite basin, which contains an abundance of K-rich brines, including shallow brines (i.e., surface brines and intercrystalline brines) in salt lakes and deep brines (i.e., pore brines and oilfield brines) in the strata. Significant studies on these brines have been reported; however, the integrated studies on sources of K, its distribution, and the sedimentary pattern of the two brine types are still inadequate. In this study, the K+ concentrations of sixty-four intercrystalline brines from the Qarhan Salt Lake (QSL), the largest playa in the QB, are presented. After combining those results with the major ionic compositions of river waters and deep K-rich brines, and the K+ concentrations of shallow brines in the QB, we concluded that: (1) The K of brines in the QSL is mainly from the high-flux K input by rivers which gain K from silicate weathering, while the "ancient Qaidam Lake" contributed little K to the QSL; (2) the large K flux supplied by rivers, the appropriate concentration degree, and the mixing of river waters and spring waters, cooperatively account for the highest K concentrations of brines in the QSL in the QB. The different river K recharges in different sections and isolated depressions are responsible for uneven K+ concentrations of brines in the QSL. (3) The deep brines are mainly distributed in the western QB. The K source of pore brines is from the interaction of pore water with the overlying evaporite layer. While the K in oilfield brines may be meteoric water, salt dissolution, the mixing of hydrothermal fluids, and the conversion of clay minerals to K-feldspar may consume K in the oilfield brines.

We investigated Microcystis diversity in these systems by targeting cpcBA (phycocyanin gene intergenic spacer and flanking regions) and mcyA gene (encodes part of a peptide synthetase cluster for production of the toxin microcystin). Distinct differences in Microcystis populations in the KR reservoirs (Copco and Iron Gate reservoirs) and SFBD were found in both gene loci, and diversity in the mcyA gene discriminated the populations in the 2 ecosystems entirely. The cpcBA sequences from KR fell into 2 main clusters, and were closely similar to sequences from North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. The majority of the cpcBA sequences in populations from SFBD formed a unique group, while the remaining sequences were closely similar to those from KR. Salinity, soluble reactive phosphorus concentration, pH, water transparency, and NH4+ and NO3- + NO2- concentrations were significantly different in the 2 systems. The consistent differences in the 2 genetic markers between KR and SFBD populations suggest that Microcystis populations in the 2 watersheds have had limited connectivity or a different initial source population, or that environmental selection is creating distinct Microcystis populations in the eutrophic KR freshwater reservoirs and the saltwater influenced SFBD. Although Microcystis is globally distributed in temporal and subtropical climates, this study suggests local microdiversity exists and may be linked with environmental regulation.

Current-use pesticides and organochlorine compounds in precipitation and lake sediment from two high-elevation national parks in the Western United States	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												Current-use pesticides (CUPs) and banned organochlorine compounds (OCCs) were measured in precipitation (snowpack and rain) and lake sediments from two national parks in the Western United States to determine their occurrence and distribution in high-elevation environments. CUPs frequently detected in snow were endosulfan, dacthal, and chlorothalonil in concentrations ranging from 0.07 to 2.4 ng/L. Of the OCCs, chlordane, hexachlorobenzene, and two polychlorinated biphenyl congeners were detected in only one snow sample each. Pesticides most frequently detected in rain were atrazine, carbaryl, and dacthal in concentrations from 3.0 to 95 ng/L. Estimated annual deposition rates in one of the parks were 8.4 mu g/m(2) for atrazine, 9.9 mu g/m(2) for carbaryl, and 2.6 mu g/m(2) for dacthal, of which > 85% occurred during summer. p,p'-DDE and p,p'-DDD were the most frequently detected OCCs in surface sediments from lakes. However, concentrations were low (0.12 to 4.7 mu g/kg) and below levels at which harmful effects for benthic organisms are likely to be observed. DDD and DDE concentrations in an age-dated sediment core suggest that atmospheric deposition of DDT and its degradates, and possibly other banned OCCs, to high-elevation areas have been decreasing since the 1970s. Dacthal and endosulfan sulfate were present in low concentrations (0.11 to 1.2 mu g/kg) and were the only CUPs detected in surface sediments. Both pesticides were frequently detected in snow, confirming that some CUPs entering high-elevation aquatic environments through atmospheric deposition are accumulating in lake sediments and potentially in aquatic biota as well.																			0090-4341					APR	2007	52	3					294	305		10.1007/s00244-006-0096-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00244-006-0096-1								17285235					WOS:000245169000002

Identification and prioritization of sites with overwintering cyanobacteria to inform preventative management of harmful algal blooms	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC PLANT MANAGEMENT												Cyanobacteria causing harmful algal blooms (HABs) can overwinter in sediments as quiescent cells (akinetes or vegetative colonies) and contribute to bloom resurgences. Targeting overwintering cells in sediments for preventative management may provide a viable approach to delay onset and mitigate blooms. However, there are limited resources for this novel strategy. Given the growing global impact of HABs, the ability to identify and prioritize sites that are influenced by overwintering cells will be a critical step for preventative management. Therefore, the overall objective of this study was to identify and illustrate relevant data to support identification and prioritization of sites that contain overwintering cells with the potential to form HABs. To achieve this, sediment samples were collected from three HAB-affected reservoirs (Marion Reservoir, KS; Fort Gibson Lake, OK, and Heyburn Lake, OK) as pertinent examples. Cyanobacteria enumeration and growth potential data from incubation studies were assembled for prioriti-zation. Overwintering cells were present in all HAB-affected reservoirs, with 85% of sites (n = 13) containing overwin-tering cells in sediments and 54% of sites (n = 13) with a planktonic growth potential producing problematic cell densities (. 100,000 cells ml 1). On the basis of the weight of evidence, Marion Reservoir, followed by Fort Gibson, and last, Heyburn Lake, have the greatest potential for over-wintering cells to contribute to HABs. These data indicate that a monitoring approach should consider at least two lines of evidence: 1) presence and density of overwintering cyanobacteria and 2) growth potential as informed by laboratory incubation studies to predict growth risk and prioritize locations for preventative management.																			0146-6623					JAN	2023	61						30	41																WOS:001054110700005

Tropical storm-induced landslide-dammed lakes and debris flow hazards at Ocotepeque, Western Honduras	LANDSLIDES												One of the deadliest tropical storms on record in Central America is the 1934 tropical storm that resulted in over 3000 fatalities; the majority of fatalities caused by floods, debris flows, and landslides. The hardest hit region was in western Honduras near the city of Ocotepeque, where 64cm of rain fell on June 4, 1934. The rainfall caused a rock landslide forming a natural dam in a mountain valley above Ocotepeque. The dam failed 3days later on June 7. The ensuing debris flow destroyed Ocotepeque killing an estimated 486 people, over 10% of the city's population. There was little to no reporting of this disaster due to the city's remote location and lack of adequate communications. Following this event, the city was relocated 4km north of Ocotepeque and renamed Nueva Ocotepeque. Over time, however, the old location, Ocotepeque, was resettled and called Antigua Ocotepeque. In this study, we examine the 1934 event and the effects of a similar recurrence on both Antigua Ocotepeque and Nueva Ocotepeque. Landslide hazard maps of the area (for shallow landslides) were generated and used to investigate the possibility of landslide dams forming. The potential debris flow inundation areas were predicted, and the effects of potential debris flows were investigated. Deterministic slope stability analyses conducted on the new location indicated that potential landslides could be more significant than suggested by the current hazard maps.

Sedimentary architecture of the southern basin of Lake of the Woods, Minnesota and its relation to Lake Agassiz history and Holocene environmental change	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Lake of the Woods (LOTW) is a large, complex lake basin once occupied by glacial Lake Agassiz. High-resolution seismic-reflection profiles and cores in the shallow, open southern basin of LOTW reveal a sedimentary architecture comprising four lacustrine units separated by three low-stand unconformities. These units represent several phases of Lake Agassiz and its changing configuration. One unconformity marks the Moorhead low phase and another marks the separation of LOTW from Lake Agassiz, perhaps similar to 10 cal ka BP, as the level of the latter fell, but before final drainage of Agassiz. Initially, the separate Holocene lake in the southern basin was broad and shallow, sometimes marshy or dry. Shortly after 8 cal ka BP, the southern basin dried up completely, despite the progressive rise of the northern outlet of the lake due to differential isostatic uplift. The resulting hiatus is related to the well-documented mid-Holocene arid interval in central North America. A return to wetter conditions in the late Holocene caused the southern basin of LOTW to refill since about 3800 cal yr BP. Late Holocene sediments have accumulated slightly asymmetrically in the basin, possible due to continued southward transgression of the lake as a result of isostatic tilting.

J	Chen, M; Wu, H; Wo, F				Chen, Xiaomin; Wu, Huashan; Wo, Fei			Nitrate vertical transport in the main paddy soils of Tai Lake region, China	GEODERMA												The influence of texture, bulk density, and organic matter content on the process of nitrate vertical transport in the three main paddy soils (Bai soil. Huangni soil and Wushan soil) of the Tai Lake region were studied in the soil columns. Breakthrough curves (BTC) were obtained separately for each of thirteen horizons. The results were as follows: vertical transport velocity of nitrate decreased, and the BTCs of nitrate were more dispersed, in each horizon from the surface layer to the bottom in every soil profile. Among the three soils, the average flux of Wushan soil was the least and its nitrate BTC was the most dispersed. Under saturated conditions, nitrate penetrated the soil column quickly. The transport of nitrate was affected by clav content. As the clay content increased, nitrate outflow was retarded, and the peak concentration was reduced. Nitrate BTCs rose and fell (gently when the nitrate concentration was lower. All nitrate BTCs were asymmetric, and tailing was more obvious when clay content was hi-h. Soil bulk density and the organic matter content also affected the vertical transport of nitrate. Low bulk density and high organic matter content were each associated with faster nitrate transport. An analytical solute transport model (CXTFIT 2.0) was used to estimate the nitrate dispersion coefficient and average pore-water velocity from the observed breakthrough curves. The results showed that the analytical solute transport model was suitable in fitting the observed nitrate transport in these soils. The dispersion coefficient was found to be a function of average pore-water velocity. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

However, current forecasts do not predict the microcystin toxins produced by these blooms. In this study, we used an extensive dataset of microcystin concentrations to generate weekly distribution maps in Lake Erie for the summers of 2018 and 2019. Using a 3D Eulerian tracer model (ETM) initialized with these maps, we simulated microcystin transport over 7 days, under two conditions: (1) the initial microcystin is mixed within the surface-mixed layer; (2) the initial microcystin is distributed throughout the entire water column. Two scenarios were tested for each condition: one incorporating microcystin production rates into hydrodynamic transport and one excluding them. Model performance was evaluated against weekly sample data in predicting whether microcystin concentrations surpassed specific thresholds (0.3, 1.0, 5.0, 10.0, and 20.0 lg/L), and in predicting trend directionality over each week. Overall, the ETM with hydrodynamics alone captured the transport of microcystins and predicted microcystin concentrations in 69% of the simulations. Incorporating microcystin production into the model increased the accuracy of forecasts by an additional 10%. Moreover, models with microcystin production successfully predicted microcystin concentrations greater than 5 lg/L during a large bloom, highmicrocystin year (2019), while incorrectly forecasting concentrations above 5 lg/L during a small bloom year (2018). With limited data to initialize the ETM, no single model configuration consistently outperformed others. It is necessary to consider the full range of model configurations when utilizing their outputs for making management decisions. (c) 2023 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

Intercalibration of MERIS, MODIS, and OLCI Satellite Imagers for Construction of Past, Present, and Future Cyanobacterial Biomass Time Series	REMOTE SENSING												Satellite imagery has been used to monitor and assess Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs), specifically, cyanobacterial blooms in Lake Erie (the USA and Canada) for over twelve years. In recent years, imagery has been applied to the other Great Lakes as well as other U.S. lakes. The key algorithm used in this monitoring system is the cyanobacterial index (CI), a measure of the chlorophyll found in cyanobacterial blooms. The CI is a "spectral shape" (or curvature) algorithm, which is a form of the second derivative around the 681 nm (MERIS/OLCI) or 678 nm (MODIS) band, which is robust and implicitly includes an atmospheric correction, allowing reliable use for many more scenes than analytical algorithms. Monitoring of cyanobacterial blooms with the CI began with the European Space Agency's (ESA) Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) sensor (2002-2012). With the loss of data from MERIS in the spring of 2012, the monitoring system shifted to using NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). MODIS has bands that allow computation of a CI product, which was intercalibrated with MERIS at the time to establish a conversion of MODIS CI to MERIS CI. In 2016, ESA launched the Ocean and Land Color Imager (OLCI), the replacement for MERIS, on the Sentinel-3 spacecraft. MODIS can serve two purposes. It can provide a critical data set for the blooms of 2012-2015, and it offers a bridge from MERIS to OLCI. We propose a basin-wide integrated technique for intercalibrating the CI algorithm from MODIS to both MERIS and OLCI. This method allowed us to intercalibrate OLCI CI to MERIS CI, which would then allow the production of a 20-year and ongoing record of cyanobacterial bloom activity. This approach also allows updates as sensor calibrations change or new sensors are launched, and it could be readily applied to spectral shape algorithms.

Cross-Scale Interactions Dictate Regional Lake Carbon Flux and Productivity Response to Future Climate	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Lakes support globally important food webs through algal productivity and contribute significantly to the global carbon cycle. However, predictions of how broad-scale lake carbon flux and productivity may respond to future climate are extremely limited. Here, we used an integrated modeling framework to project changes in lake-specific and regional primary productivity and carbon fluxes under 21st century climate for thousands of lakes. We observed high uncertainty in whether lakes collectively were to increase or decrease lake CO2 emissions and carbon burial in our modeled region owing to divergence in projected regional water balance among climate models. Variation in projected air temperature influenced projected changes in lake primary productivity (but not CO2 emissions or carbon burial) as warmer air temperatures decreased productivity through reduced lake water volume. Cross-scale interactions between regional drivers and local characteristics dictated the magnitude and direction of lake-specific carbon flux and productivity responses to future climate. Plain Language Summary Primary production in lakes sustains important aquatic food webs, and, collectively, lakes play an important role in the global carbon cycle and contribute substantially to global greenhouse gas dynamics and resulting changes in climate. Primary production in lakes and net carbon emissions are affected by climate change. In this study, we simulated lake carbon dynamics and algae growth for thousands of lakes in response to future climate scenarios. Projected future lake contributions to regional greenhouse gas emissions and algal growth were uncertain because of wide variation in future temperature and precipitation, especially in summer. Local characteristics (e.g., water flow paths and lake water color) dictated how much and in which direction individual lake greenhouse gas emissions and algal growth responded to future climate, highlighting the need for computer simulations that account for interacting effects of regional climate and local characteristics on lake dynamics.

This has resulted in the construction of a number of dams in potential areas over the years. As there are a lot of risk factors associated with the existence of these dams, it has become the need of the hour to develop a proper monitoring and regarding the opening of the shutters thereby management system for maintaining a safe water level in dams. Mismanagement of dams can lead to manmade disasters. Currently dams in our state are being monitored and controlled manually. This manual intervention can increase the probability of error and also results in time lag in decision making. The aim of this project is to design and implement an IoT based Disaster Monitoring and Management System for Dams (IDMMSD). The proposed system involves real-time monitoring of water levels of a group of dams under study. Water levels may vary due to drastic changes in water levels of connected rivers or lakes, or due to excessive rainfall in the catchment area. The proposed project includes a mechatronics system to open the shutters at the heights pre calculated. The system comprises of sensor nodes, smart controller and communication system. The proposed system is an app based IoT system which will monitor and send real time parameters related to Dam (gate position, water discharge, water level) and weather conditions (rain fall, temperature, humidity). There will be two modes for operating the software i.e. Autopilot mode and Manual data mode. The system also includes features like SMS alert to the people of the locality and SOS to rescue operations in case of adverse weather conditions.

Urban anglers' adherence to fish consumption advisories in the Great Lakes region	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Urban anglers are considered a group at high risk of being exposed to contaminants from fish consumption. Past studies of urban anglers' fish consumption, however, have had significant limitations making it difficult to generalize their findings broadly and to assess the degree to which urban anglers are complying with advisory recommendations. We used a diary method to collect detailed information on fish consumption in three cities in the Great Lakes region for a 4-month period during the summer of 2014. We assessed how much fish anglers were consuming, whether they were complying with fish consumption advisories, and how fish consumption and advisory compliance varied for different demographic groups and in different locations. We estimated a mean of 1.12 meals/week of fish and 25.1-26.8 g/day of fish, and the amount of fish consumed varied by no >25% from one site to another. Advisory exceedance was more variable, however, ranging from 7-10% to 27-40% in our three study sites. Fish consumption increased with age, education, and income, and was higher for non-whites than for whites. Advisory exceedance was higher for women, non-whites, and older anglers. At each site, the types of fish that contributed the most to advisory exceedance varied, which points to the benefits of community-specific (and resource-intensive) fish consumption advisories. Our findings could help fish consumption advisory programs tailor their advice to vulnerable populations and particular locations. (C) 2017 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

The boiling pools hosted inside the summit crater (Active Crater) are characterized by high contents of magmatic-related compounds (SO2, HCl and HF) that strongly affect the chemistry of the crater lake. These chemical features are not shown by the thermal discharges seeping out in the surrounding area of the volcano. Here, the shallow aquifer apparently masks any possible clues related to the magmatic system. This suggests that the fluid vents located inside the Active Crater are likely to represent the most appropriate sampling sites for geochemical surveillance purposes, although the high gas discharge rate from the lake may occasionally prevent any fluid sampling. Alternatively, as already suggested by recent studies on the behavior of light hydrocarbons in different volcanic environments, the compositional features of the organic gas fraction in the more accessible outer flank thermal discharges could usefully be utilized, at least, to assess the thermodynamic conditions of the volcanic-hydrothermal system, since these compounds are affected by secondary processes only at limited extent.

J	Ruggaber, TP; Talley, JW; Montestruque, LA				Ruggaber, Timothy P.; Talley, Jeffrey W.; Montestruque, Luis A.			Using embedded sensor networks to monitor, control, and reduce CSO events: A pilot study	ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE												Each year in the United States, combined sewer overflow (CSO) events result in the release of 850 billion gallons of untreated wastewater into lakes and rivers, causing drinking water contamination, human illness, animal and fish kills, and eutrophication. This paper examines the ability of an embedded sensor network to reduce the frequency and severity of CSO events by maximizing the existing storage capacity in the combined sewer system (CSS). This novel network system is called combined sewer overflow network (CSONet). CSONet uses data gathered from a distributed network of sensors to provide decentralized, distributed, real-time control of the CSS's storage capacity using automated valves called smart valves. One pilot CSONet was deployed in South Bend, IN, during the summer of 2005. It controlled the storage of storm water runoff in a large retention basin using level data from sensors within the basin and at the CSO outfall, 3.2 miles away. Once there was no longer a threat of a CSO event, CSONet automatically released the stored water into the CSS and prepared for the next storm. Before the CSONet was in place, the basin was very ineffective during small and medium storm events. The basin can now store all of the water that enters it during most storm events, preventing an equal volume of wastewater from overflowing into the St. Joseph River. Further work is being done to expand CSONet to handle in-line storage, smart valves in series, and predictive control.																			1092-8758					MAR	2007	24	2					172	182		10.1089/ees.2006.0041	http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/ees.2006.0041													WOS:000243599800004

Arctic Holocene proxy climate database - new approaches to assessing geochronological accuracy and encoding climate variables	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												We present a systematic compilation of previously published Holocene proxy climate records from the Arctic. We identified 170 sites from north of 58 degrees N latitude where proxy time series extend back at least to 6 cal ka (all ages in this article are in calendar years before present - BP), are resolved at submillennial scale (at least one value every 400 +/- 200 years) and have age models constrained by at least one age every 3000 years. In addition to conventional meta-data for each proxy record (location, proxy type, reference), we include two novel parameters that add functionality to the database. First, "climate interpretation" is a series of fields that logically describe the specific climate variable(s) represented by the proxy record. It encodes the proxy-climate relation reported by authors of the original studies into a structured format to facilitate comparison with climate model outputs. Second, "geochronology accuracy score" (chron score) is a numerical rating that reflects the overall accuracy of C-14-based age models from lake and marine sediments. Chron scores were calculated using the original author-reported C-14 ages, which are included in this database. The database contains 320 records (some sites include multiple records) from six regions covering the circumpolar Arctic: Fennoscandia is the most densely sampled region (31% of the records), whereas only five records from the Russian Arctic met the criteria for inclusion. The database contains proxy records from lake sediment (60 %), marine sediment (32 %), glacier ice (5 %), and other sources. Most (61 %) reflect temperature (mainly summer warmth) and are primarily based on pollen, chironomid, or diatom assemblages. Many (15 %) reflect some aspect of hydroclimate as inferred from changes in stable isotopes, pollen and diatom assemblages, humification index in peat, and changes in equilibrium-line altitude of glaciers. This comprehensive database can be used in future studies to investigate the spatio-temporal pattern of Arctic Holocene climate changes and their causes. The Arctic Holocene data set is available from NOAA Paleoclimatology.					de Vernal, Anne/D-5602-2013; Axford, Yarrow/N-4151-2014; Birks, H.

Perfluorinated Chemicals in Meromictic Lakes on the Northern Coast of Ellesmere Island, High Arctic Canada	ARCTIC												Perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs) have been recorded in many types of marine and freshwater ecosystems. The aim of the present study was to examine meromictic lakes and their catchments on the far northern coast of Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, Canada, and to evaluate the results in the context of climate change. Our analyses revealed the presence of several PFCs in catchment snowpack, inflowing streams, lake water, and the aquatic food web of Lake A (83 degrees 00'N, 75 degrees 30'W), showing that dispersal of these contaminants reaches the northern limit of the terrestrial High Arctic. However, the concentrations were low (total PFCs: 27-754 pg L-1 for water, 134-848 pg L-1 for melted snow, 5-2149 pg g(-1) wet weight for fish; PFOS: 66 pg g(-1) dry weight in surficial sediments) and at or below values reported to date in the literature for other remote lakes. PFHpA, PFOA, and PFNA were the main compounds detected in water and melted snow, while PFNA, PFDA, and PFUnA were the predominant compounds in the aquatic biota, indicating their bioaccumulative potential. Salinity-temperature-depth profiles suggested that most of the present contaminant load enters the lake via streams and flows directly under the lake ice to the ocean. The onset of summer open water in this perennially ice-covered lake in response to climate warming, and the increased duration of open water in recent years; have implications for the distribution, transport, and retention of PFCs in Arctic lakes.

J	Norlin, JI; Bayley, SE; Ross, LCM				Norlin, JI; Bayley, SE; Ross, LCM			Zooplankton composition and ecology in western boreal shallow-water wetlands	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Zooplankton are a functionally important but poorly studied component of western boreal forest (WBF) wetland ecosystems. To characterize patterns in zooplankton abundance and composition an exploratory study of 24 shallow-water wetlands in northern Alberta, Canada was carried out over the summers of 2001 and 2002. Results suggest zooplankton communities in WBF wetlands tend to exist as: (1) small-cladoceran dominated communities, (2) larger sized cladoceran (e.g. Daphnia) dominated communities, or (3) communities composed primarily of rotifers and/or other crustacean zooplankton. The presence/absence of brook stickleback (Culea inconstans) was the factor most strongly linked to zooplankton structure with small cladocerans tending to dominate in wetlands with stickleback. In fishless wetlands, communities dominated by medium-large sized cladocerans tended to correspond with low-chlorophyll/high-submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) conditions. Conversely, communities composed of rotifers and other crustaceans were associated with high-chlorophyll/low-SAV states. Macro-invertebrate predator abundance was not strongly linked to patterns in zooplankton composition suggesting macro-invertebrate predation is not a significant factor influencing zooplankton structure in fishless wetlands. Results suggest activities that spread stickleback (e.g. ditching) or inhibit development of macrophyte-dominated/clear-water conditions (e.g. nutrient loading) may seriously alter the zooplankton community structure, and thereby the functional ecology, of these valuable wetland ecosystems.

Typically, there is an accumulation of old, small-sized and heavily parasitized fish. In an attempt to alleviate this problem and to initiate a commercial fishery in the 25 km(2) lake Stuorajavri, northern Norway, a large-scale fish removal programme was carried out from 1981 to 1983. Over the 3-year period, a total of 101 metric tons of fish, including 96 tons of whitefish, was removed front the lake. The effects of this management programme have been followed by annual or biannual investigations from 1981 to 1998. In the first years after the stock depletion, the whitefish exhibited enhanced growth rates and highly reduced incidence of parasite infection. The age distribution changed towards a dominance of younger fish, whereas the size span of the fish stock increased also to include large-sized fish. It was hoped that improved conditions would encourage initiation of a commercial fishery, but this did not come about due to practical and economical reasons. The 3-year period of intensive fishing was therefore followed by a long period of negligible exploitation. During this period, the whitefish stock gradually returned towards the pre-removal situation with respect to growth, population structure and parasitization. The results are discussed in relation to aspects of stability and the management of stunted fish populations.

We used 20 optically-stimulated luminescence and conventional radiocarbon dates to construct chronological frameworks for four aeolian sections. The results indicate that aeolian activity occurred episodically at 12.5 ka, 11.2 ka, similar to 9.0 ka, similar to 8.5 ka, 5.5 ka, 2.6 (2.4) ka and 1(0.9) ka. Paleosols developed mainly during 9.5-4 ka. The field stratigraphy of the sections, together with measurements of grain size, magnetic susceptibility (MS), and total organic carbon (TOC), indicate that aeolian activity was strong during the Last Glacial period. Following the Younger Dryas (YD), Holocene interglacial conditions began to develop in the Qinghai Lake basin at similar to 12 ka. With the strengthened Asian summer monsoon (ASM) and the decrease in insolation, the climate became warm and humid. According to the record of aeolian activity, the early Holocene can be divided into two intervals, before and after similar to 9.5 ka. Aeolian activity remained strong from similar to 12 ka-9.5 ka, although the climate was more humid than that of the Last Glacial period. Between 9.5 ka and 8.5 ka the aeolian activity weakened and the climate became warm and wet, but variable. Following the mid-Holocene Climatic Optimum, the climate became significantly drier at similar to 4 ka and aeolian activity strengthened again. Overall, the ASM dominated aeolian activity in the Qinghai Lake basin during the Holocene, with enhanced aeolian activity corresponding to a weakened ASM. Paleosol development exhibited a lagged response to the strengthened ASM, and therefore aeolian sand layers in the section do not always indicate a cold and dry climate. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The principal morphological features of the upper St. Clair River included flow-transverse bedforms that appear weakly mobile, erosive bedforms in cohesive muds, thin non-cohesive veneers of weakly mobile sediment that cover an underlying cohesive (till or glacio-lacustrine) surface, and vegetation that covers the bed. The flow was characterized by acceleration as the banks constrict from Lake Huron into the St. Clair River, an approximately 1500-m long region of flow separation downstream from the Blue Water Bridge, and secondary flow connected to: i) channel curvature; ii) forcing of the flow by local bed topography, and iii) flow wakes in the lee side of ship wrecks. Nearshore, sand-sized, sediment from Lake Huron was capable of being transported into, and principally along, the banks of the upper St. Clair River by the measured flow. A comparison of bathymetric surveys conducted in 2007 and 2008 identifies that the gravel bed does undergo slow downstream movement, but that this movement does not appear to be generated by the mean flow, and could possibly be caused by ship-propeller-induced turbulence. The study results suggest that the measured mean flow and dredging within the channel have not produced major scour of the upper St Clair River and that the recent fall in the level of Lake Huron is unlikely to have been caused by these mechanisms.

GEODYNAMICS OF A CORDILLERAN OROGENIC SYSTEM: THE CENTRAL ANDES OF ARGENTINA AND NORTHERN CHILE	Geological Society of America Memoir											The Arizaro Basin in northwestern Argentina sits today in the western Puna Plateau at elevations of 3800-4200 m along the eastern flank of the Miocene to modern magmatic arc. The basin is roughly circular in plan view and similar to 100 km in diameter, and it was filled during Miocene time (ca. 21-9 Ma) by >3.5 km of eolian, alluvial, fluvial, and lacustrine sediment in addition to ash-fall tuffs from the Andean magmatic arc. The basin fill was subsequently shortened in its central part, and it has been uplifted and topographically inverted. The Arizaro Basin is not obviously related to known faults, nor does it exhibit a peripheral belt of coarse-grained sedimentary rocks derived from flanking topographically higher regions. Sandstone modal framework compositions are arkosic, but not as rich in volcanic lithic fragments as typical intra-arc basins. Detrital zircon U-Pb age spectra implicate source terranes in locally exposed Ordovician granitoid rocks, more distal Upper Paleozoic-Mesozoic arc terranes in western Argentina and possibly northern Chile, and the local Miocene magmatic arc. Depositional-age zircons are present in most of the sandstones analyzed for detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology, and zircon U-Pb ages from volcanic tuff layers provide independent chronological control. The tectonic component of subsidence initiated at low rates, accelerated to similar to 0.6 mm/yr during the medial stage of basin development, and tapered off to zero as the basin began to shorten internally and experience topographic inversion after ca. 10 Ma. Together, the data presented here suggest that the Arizaro Basin could have developed in response to the formation and gravitational foundering of a dense Rayleigh-Taylor-type instability in the lower crust and/or mantle lithosphere. Insofar as hinterland basins of uncertain tectonic affinity are widespread in the high central Andes, the model developed here may be relevant for other regions of enigmatic subsidence and sediment accumulation in the Andes and other cordilleran hinterland settings.

ICE EFFECTS ON FLOW DISTRIBUTIONS WITHIN THE ATHABASCA DELTA, CANADA	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												The Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD) is a unique and ecologically sensitive area made up of many interconnected lakes, wetlands, streams and rivers. The hydrology of the Delta is heavily influenced by inflows from the Athabasca River and the complex river ice regime within it. In this study, a detailed one-dimensional network hydraulic model of the Athabasca River Delta (comprising the southern portion of the PAD) is presented and applied to demonstrate how variable stream-flow and ice cover conditions affect the distribution of flow among the major channels conveying water to Lake Athabasca and the rest of the Delta. The current channel network model, based on new measurements concentrated at the main channel junctions combined with carefully designed geometry throughout the un-surveyed reaches, is shown to provide flow allocations to the major channels that are within 3% of the corresponding observations. At the three main flow-split junctions, steady flow simulations at varying discharge, Lake Athabasca level, and ice thickness were performed to assess their impact on the percentage of flow carried by each channel. Each junction was found to exhibit a unique response arising from its physical geometry and location within the Delta. Transient simulations for the historical period 1960-2007 demonstrate that water demand on the Athabasca River upstream of the PAD may have a significant impact on the availability of fish habitat in winter. Imposing a 20 m(3)/s water demand increased the total occurrences of a no-flow condition in the Fletcher Channel, analogous to it freezing to the bed, by 53%.

Surveillance for Ceratomyxa shasta in the Puget Sound watershed, Washington	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC ANIMAL HEALTH												Discovery of fish exhibiting clinical signs of ceratomyxosis in Washington State prompted concern over the potential impact of the myxozoan parasite Ceratomyxa shasta on native stocks of steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss (anadromous rainbow trout). To investigate these concerns, a survey of 16 freshwater systems within the Puget Sound watershed, including Lake Washington, was conducted by sentinel exposure of susceptible fish (cutthroat trout O. clarkii and rainbow trout). Fish were exposed for 7 d during September 2003 and May 2004 and then were returned to a holding facility for monitoring of disease signs. Mortality caused by the parasite occurred only in the exposure group held at the University of Washington Hatchery, which receives its water from Portage Bay of Lake Washington. Fish from all other sites were negative for C. shasta, both visually and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, except for a single fish held at the Tumwater Falls Hatchery in September 2003. A single deformed spore was detected in that fish, but infection could not be confirmed by PCR and the parasite was not detected from any other fish held at that site during either the September or the May exposure. From these results, we conclude that C. shasta is not likely to have contributed significantly to the decline of steelhead populations throughout Puget Sound.																			0899-7659					JUN	2007	19	2					116	120		10.1577/H06-029.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/H06-029.1								18201052					WOS:000247709900007

Coupling accurate forest road information with planning and conservation strategies supports forest resource management. In Canada, spatial data of forestry road networks are available provincially; however, they lack spatial accuracy, and up-to-date information on key attributes such as road width is missing. In this study, we apply a novel approach to update forest road networks and characterize road conditions in Ontario's Boreal and Great Lakes-St. Lawrence (GLSL) Forest regions. We use airborne laser scanning (ALS), to facilitate the identification of forest roads across densely forested landscapes. We categorized roads into four classes based on driveable width, edge vegetation, as well as surface and edge degradation as derived from high-density Single Photon LiDAR (SPL) data. Using a novel road extraction method, we produced a road probability raster and map road centerlines. We validated road location and attribute information using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) ground truth data in two Ontario forest management units, in the boreal forest and the GLSL. Road segments in some regions have been altered to account for land cover changes, such as flooding or fallen trees. In other situations, the road path may deviate from the planned layout of the road, which is not always followed in the field. Our results highlight inaccuracies in the existing road networks, with 30 per cent of 'Full access' roads and 29 per cent of 'Partial access' roads being undriveable by standard vehicles and 45 per cent of 'Status unknown' roads, which make up 48 per cent of the pre-existing network, being driveable by standard vehicles. Results show that the average positional accuracy of updated road centerlines is 0.4 m, and the average road width error is 2 m. The production of spatially accurate forest road networks and road attribute information is important for characterizing large road networks for which often minimal information is available.

J	Tao, YQ; Liu, DH				Tao, Yuqiang; Liu, Donghong			Trophic status affects the distribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the water columns, surface sediments, and plankton of twenty Chinese lakes	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												The influence of trophic status on the distribution of hydrophobic organic contaminants (HOCs) in different subtropical shallow waters at large spatial scales remains largely unknown. In this study, samples of surface sediments, water, total suspended particles, phytoplankton, and zooplankton were simultaneously collected from 83 sampling sites in 20 subtropical oligotrophic to hyper-eutrophic shallow lakes in China to investigate the influence of trophic status on the spatial distribution and sinking fluxes of 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH5). The total concentration of the 16 PAHs (Sigma PAH(16)) in the water columns of these lakes varied from 0.22 to 5.81 mu g L-1, and increased with the trophic state index (TSI) and phytoplankton biomass. Phytoplankton were the dominant reservoir for the PAH5 in the water column. However, the fraction of Sigma PAH(16) in phytoplankton decreased with the TSI. The average sinking flux of Sigma PAH(16) of the individual lakes varied from 2257.1 to 261674.1 mg m(-2) d(-1), and increased with the TSI of the lakes. The concentration of Sigma PAEL(16) in the surface sediments ranged from 385.77 to 3784.37 ng g(dw)(-1) and increased with the TSI and the ratio of phycocyanin/sediment organic carbon. It suggested that cyanobacterial biomass affected by trophic status dominated the occurrence of the PAHs in the surface sediments of these lakes. Biomass dilution and the biological pump affected the accumulation of the PAH5 in phytoplankton, and zooplankton, and had more influence on the PAHs with higher hydrophobicity. Both the bioconcentration factors and bioaccumulation factors of the PAH5 decreased with the TSI. No biomagnification was observed for the PAHs from phytoplankton to zooplankton in these lakes in spring. Our study provided novel knowledge for the coupling between eutrophication and HOCs in 20 subtropical shallow lakes with different trophic status. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the range of this species is sufficiently mapped only in Balkans. Based on the detailed mapping of the species in Georgia, we analysed the environmental factors influencing species occurrence and produced spatial models for the entire range. Nine models based on the logistic regression, discriminant function analysis, and classification tree analysis, all showed significant influence of the vegetation index and maximum summer temperature on the species distribution. The habitat suitability models based on the presence-only data (Mahalanobis distance estimation and Maximum Entropy approach) had a better performance than the models based on the presence-absence data. The habitat suitability models included two variables only, identified as significant in all preliminary analyses. The area identified as suitable by presence-only models strongly increases when a few environmental variables are included in the analysis. When only two variables are considered, the model predicted large areas north of the actual range. Competition with the related common spadefoot toad (P. fuscus) might have a role on the position of the northern limit of the range of P. syriacus. Within the predicted range, use of breeding sites is negatively associated with presence of fish. Breeding pond preferences of P. syriacus were particularly similar to those of the lake frog (Rana ridibunda), although the latter species uses appropriate habitats more extensively.

J	HARRINGTON, JF; THOMPSON, RC				HARRINGTON, JF; THOMPSON, RC			EFFECT OF VARIETY AND AREA OF PRODUCTION ON SUBSEQUENT GERMINATION OF LETTUCE SEED AT HIGH TEMPERATURES	PROCEEDINGS OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE												80 samples of lettuce seed from California and Arizona fields harvested in 1948 and 1950 were germinated in darkness at 24, 26, 28, and 30[degree]C. The samples represented 12 vars. and 9 growing areas. The high temp, breaking points for germination of lettuce seed of the lots tested fell between 24[degree] and 30[degree]C, with the most clearcut differentiation at 26[degree]C where germination ranged from 7 to 93%. Below 24[degree]C all lots germinated well. In 1948 Imperials 456, 17, 101, and Great Lakes showed better germination at 26[degree]C than Imperials 44 and D, which in turn were better than Imperial 615. The region where the seed was grown had a significant effect on the germination at high temps. Seed from warm areas germinated better than that from cooler but dry areas. Very poor germination at 26[degree]C was obtained with seed from cool humid coastal areas. This effect persisted 18 mos. after harvest of the 1948 seed crop. Highly significant positive correlations were established between the high temp, germination percentages and the temps. 10 or 30 days preceding harvest. Negative correlations probably exist between these and the relative humidities of the areas of production.																			0099-4065						1952	59	JUN					445	450																WOS:A1952YB31000069

Jiangxi Province, which is located in southeastern China and ringed on three sides by mountains, contains many nature reserves and harbors large number of orchids. Here, we conducted field surveys of orchids in 35 nature reserves in Jiangxi, using sampling lines and plots. We also analyzed the relationship between orchid richness and density with environmental variables and studied the relationship among these nature reserves. We found that the mountainous areas of southwestern, southern, and northeastern Jiangxi have a high richness and density of orchids, while the mountainous areas of central and northwestern Jiangxi have low richness and density. Jiulianshan and Jinggangshan are the two most rich-species reserves, with 58 and 55 orchids, respectively. Eight reserves (22% of those surveyed) had fewer than 10 orchids. Compared with soil, climate, and vegetation, topography was more closely related to the richness and density of orchids. Topographical variables explained 19% and 20% of the total variation in SR and SD, respectively. The result of hierarchical clustering analysis showed that the 35 nature reserves of Jiangxi obviously fall into two main clusters, which are separated by the Ganjiang River-Poyang Lake water system. In conclusion, the geographical patterns of richness and the density of orchids in Jiangxi are uneven and are affected by topography and vegetation, while their distribution is affected by the terrain of Jiangxi. Our work explains the richness and density patterns and the assembly mechanism of the orchids in Jiangxi and also provides new ideas for the protection of orchids in this region.					; Chen, Weixing/NWH-2664-2025; mingtao, hu/LMP-3085-2024; Zhou, Yadong/K-4890-2013	yang, boyun/0000-0003-2123-0027; 														1424-2818				OCT	2022	14	10							855	10.3390/d14100855	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d14100855													WOS:000872742800001

Fluorescence capturing behaviour of cyanobacterial resilience: Insights into UV-exposed ecosystems and its environmental applications	LUMINESCENCE												Cyanobacteria are resilient microorganisms and thrive in environments exposed to UV radiation, ranging from ocean surfaces to scorching hot springs and dry expanses. 'Cyanobacterial Resilience' refers to their ability to withstand UV radiation, revealing intricate genomic secrets and adaptive mechanisms ensuring survival. These mechanisms include metabolic adaptations, robust DNA repair systems and UV-protective compounds such as Scytonemin and Mycosporine, vital for shielding against UV radiation survival. Cyanobacteria are crucial pioneers in UV-exposed ecosystems, highlighting their resilience and adaptability. Some cyanobacteria exhibit luminescence, emitting blue-green light due to phycobiliproteins, while bioluminescence in cyanobacteria, if it occurs, involves different compounds rather than luciferins and luciferase enzymes. This luminescence holds promise for various biotechnological applications, such as biosensors, imaging probes and carbon sequestration, for participating in photocatalytic processes for water purification and CO2 conversion, and contributes to solar simulation studies to advance photosynthesis and renewable energy technologies. The versatile applications of these materials highlight their ecological importance and potential in addressing global challenges. In conclusion, 'Cyanobacterial Resilience' highlights the remarkable adaptation strategies of cyanobacteria in UV-exposed environments. It emphasises their role as pioneers and innovators in biological and technological domains, providing insights into their enduring impact on ecosystems and scientific advancement. Bio-luminescence cyanobacteria are vital in multiple fields, including serving as biological agents for nitrogen fixation and carbon sequestration. They are utilized in photocatalytic water purification, CO2 conversion, biomass production, biofertilizers, antimicrobial agents, genetic engineering, environmental monitoring sensors and solar simulation studies to advance photosynthesis and renewable energy technologies.image					Thirugnanasambandam, Prathima/AAL-6582-2021; S, Bharath/LYO-1926-2024; BM, Kanthesh/AAX-8650-2020; Selvankumar, Thangaswamy/W-1639-2019	S, Bharath/0009-0003-4757-6218; 													1522-7235	1522-7243				SEP	2024	39	9							e4898	10.1002/bio.4898	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bio.4898								39323008					WOS:001320989900001

Tyrell; Brinker, Alexander			All day-long: Sticklebacks effectively forage on whitefish eggs during all light conditions	PLOS ONE												The three-spined stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus invaded Lake Contance in the 1940s and expanded in large numbers from an exclusively shoreline habitat into the pelagic zone in 2012. Stickleback abundance is very high in the pelagic zone in winter near the spawning time of pelagic whitefish Coregonus wartmanni, and it is hypothesized that this is triggered by the opportunity to consume whitefish eggs. Field sampling has qualitatively confirmed predation of whitefish eggs by stickleback, but quantification has proven difficult due to stormy conditions that limit sampling. One fundamental unknown is if freshwater stickleback, known as visual feeders, can successfully find and eat whitefish eggs during twilight and night when whitefish spawn. It is also unknown how long eggs can be identified in stomachs following ingestion, which could limit efforts to quantify egg predation through stomach content analysis. To answer these questions, 144 individuals were given the opportunity to feed on whitefish roe under daylight, twilight, and darkness in controlled conditions. The results showed that stickleback can ingest as many as 100 whitefish eggs under any light conditions, and some individuals even consumed maximum numbers in complete darkness. Furthermore, eggs could be unambiguously identified in the stomach 24 hours after consumption. Whitefish eggs have 28% more energy content than the main diet of sticklebacks (zooplankton) based on bomb-calorimetric measurements, underlining the potential benefits of consuming eggs. Based on experimental results and estimates of stickleback abundance and total egg production, stickleback could potentially consume substantial proportions of the total eggs produced even if relatively few sticklebacks consume eggs. Given the evidence that stickleback can feed on eggs during nighttime spawning and may thereby hamper recruitment, future studies aimed at quantifying actual egg predation and resulting effects on the whitefish population are urgently needed.

J	Paul, AJ; Post, JR				Paul, AJ; Post, JR			Spatial distribution of native and nonnative salmonids in streams of the eastern slopes of the Canadian rocky mountains	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												We surveyed 53 stream reaches from the eastern slopes of the Canadian Rocky Mountains and examined the distribution of native and nonnative salmonids as related to habitat variables measured at the reach scale (100 m). The most common fishes encountered in these surveys were cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarki, bull trout Salvelinus confluentus, brook trout S. fontinalis, and rainbow trout O. mykiss. Of these salmonids, only cutthroat and bull trout are native to Kananaskis Country; however, cutthroat trout have also been extensively stocked throughout the region. Reach elevation, which strongly influenced mean summer stream temperatures, was the only habitat variable that was significantly related to the presence of all four salmonids. Both cutthroat and bull trout were more likely to occur in the higher elevations, whereas brook and rainbow trout were more likely to occur in the lower elevations. Because the distribution of stocked fishes is not independent of their original stocking locations, we tested the hypothesis that their distribution was simply an artifact of past stocking. Based on the historical stocking record for the surveyed region, brook and rainbow trout would be more prevalent in higher elevations if stocking location only dictated their presence. This expectation directly contradicts our observed results, suggesting there has been a preferential downstream movement of brook and rainbow trout to colonize streams at lower elevations. In contrast, the distribution of cutthroat trout predicted from the stocking record and observed from the stream surveys did not differ, suggesting their current distribution may reflect past stocking.																			0002-8487					MAY	2001	130	3					417	430		10.1577/1548-8659(2001)130<0417:SDONAN>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(2001)130<0417:SDONAN>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000169097600008
J	Karakoç, G; Erkoç, FÜ; Katiricoglu, H				Karakoç, G; Erkoç, FÜ; Katiricoglu, H			Water quality and impacts of pollution sources for Eymir and Mogan Lakes (Turkey)	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL												Mogan and Eymir Lakes are two shallow lakes, interconnected hydrologically in the close vicinity of Ankara, Turkey. A total of 245 km 2 of the total 971.4 km(2) watershed is under environmental protection status as "Golbasi Specially Protected Area". Potential impacts from extensive agriculture, recreation, incomplete infrastructure and other human activities, such as residential settlements, are discussed with reference to previous and more recent pollution monitoring. Six monitoring stations enabling follow-up of previous work were selected in this study. These were on die creeks feeding the lake systems. Generally, summer months showed heavier pollution loads, with Eymir Lake concentrating the pollutants due to flow from Mogan Lake. When compared with the 1995 study; COD, total-P, Kjeldahl-N in the six stations were close or slightly decreased in the present study. Suspended solids significantly decreased; possibly due to erosion control measures and decreased domestic wastewater. The improvement in the pollution state of the lakes is attributed to the construction of a sewage system going around Mogan Lake and collecting wastewater discharges and restrictions to urban settlement development around the lakes brought by the 1/25000 land use plan controlling further impact from residential developments within the protected area boundaries. The study, while addressing water quality and interactions due to human activities in shallow lakes, also discusses problems associated with human impacts in protected areas with the aim of presenting a complicated case study.

J	Luoto, TP; Nevalainen, L				Luoto, Tomi P.; Nevalainen, Liisa			Climate-driven limnological changes determine ecological thresholds in an alpine lake	AQUATIC BIOLOGY												The consequences of climate warming may be dramatic in lakes because changes in surface heating can affect physical and biological processes. We examined sedimentary remains of Cladocera and Chironomidae from a climatically sensitive lake in the Austrian Alps to test the hypothesis that changes in surface water temperature cause direct and indirect shifts in species composition. Contrary to the expectation that oxygen availability in lakes generally decreases under climate warming, our records showed that the assemblages experienced a succession towards a state with increased oxygen availability. Among the benthic fauna, an ecological threshold was crossed around the year 1850, when taxa tolerant of low oxygen concentrations disappeared and oxyphilous taxa began to dominate. In the zooplankton community, the keystone grazer Daphnia was replaced by Bosmina. These ecological changes, especially during the past 20 yr, were most likely caused by improved oxygen conditions following the decrease in depth of the thermocline. As the faunal succession was strongly correlated with alpine air temperature trends, the change in thermocline depth has likely been driven by the increasing air temperatures, which have caused warming of the epilimnion and consequently, in combination with wind-induced mixing, deepening of the thermocline. These recent changes occur alongside further increasing alpine temperatures and may be reflected in further deepening of the thermocline. We conclude that, in addition to direct climate influences, changes in summer stratification and mixing depth may cause significant changes in aquatic community compositions through changes in oxygen availability under the present climate warming conditions.

Chemical redox species measurable with the Au-amalgam include O-2, H2S, S-x(2-), S2O32-, Fe2+, Fe3+, Mn2+, I-. Bismuth was electrochemically deposited to form a solid film analogous to the Au-amalgam on a polished gold disk electrode. The useable potential window of the Bi-film was found to be narrower than that of the Au-amalgam, precluding the detection of dissolved O-2, I- and S2O32-, whose redox potentials fall outside the Bi-film's range. The Bi-film was able to detect free H2S/HS- and total sulfide (AVS), but not Fe2+ or Mn2+. The Bi-film was less sensitive to low levels of total sulfide (< 10 mu M) than the Au-amalgam; however, the Bi-film was able to accurately quantify very high concentrations of sulfide (at least 15 mM), with a linear response up to an order of magnitude higher than that of the Au-amalgam. Thus the Bi-film appears to have limited application as an alternative to the Au-amalgam microelectrode for in situ analysis of redox species in natural waters.					; Luther, III, George/A-6384-2008	Luther, George/0000-0002-0780-885X; 													1040-0397	1521-4109				JUN	2006	18	12					1167	1172		10.1002/elan.200603519	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elan.200603519													WOS:000238561300004

Benthic algal mats dominated by the prokaryotic Phormidium frigidum Fritsch and several pennate diatoms growing in shallower, more brightly illuminated areas beneath 4-5.5 m of ice accumulate and entrap bubbles of photosynthetically produced O2. Clumps of this gas-filled mat tear loose from the gravelly substrate, lift off and float to the bottom of the lake ice. Some of these floating mat pieces become frozen into newly forming ice with the onset of winter. Through the combination of ablation of ice from the upper surface and the formation of new ice from below, algal mat pieces reach the upper lake surface in 5-10 yr. Here, they are lyophilized by polar winds and dispersed in at least a partially viable state. The process of mat lift-off and escape is important in removing nutrients and salts from these lakes and helps to perpetuate their oligotrophic state. Neutron activation and X-ray dispersive analyses of elements in the algal mats along with other analyses, field observations, and calculations suggest that significant quantities of organic matter, select minerals and salts are lost from the lakes annually through this process whose magnitude has not been recognized previously.																			0022-3646	1529-8817					1982	18	1					72	78		10.1111/j.0022-3646.1982.00072.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0022-3646.1982.00072.x													WOS:A1982NH92700008
J	Liu, JL; Cho, HR; Stewart, RE				Liu, JL; Cho, HR; Stewart, RE			Characteristics of the water vapour transport over the Mackenzie River basin during the 1994/95 water year	ATMOSPHERE-OCEAN												The National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis data were used to calculate the moisture flux convergence over the Mackenzie River basin (MRB) for a 10-year period from 1987 to 1996. The analysis of these results indicates that the 1994/95 water year was associated with the least amount of water vapour transport into the MRB over this selected period. This arose due to some unique features in the vertical structure of water vapour transport. In particular, the average annual level of maximum water vapour transport occurred at 700 hPa during 1994/95; this is higher than the 850-hPa level found for other years. Because of the lower humidity at higher levels in the atmosphere, the magnitude of the most significant water vapour transport was therefore less. Detailed analyses of the monthly data for the 1994/95 water year illustrated that the decrease in water vapour transport arose, in part, because of the year's deep mixed boundary layer attributable to its warm temperatures and dry surface conditions. Of course, the magnitude of the monthly moisture flux convergence changed substantially during this water year. The largest contribution occurred from July to October 1995, with the maximum in July. Two other peaks were found in October 1994 and February 1995. The moisture flux convergence at the transition period between seasons (May and June) was very weak and sometimes even negative. To understand better the components of the water balance for this water year, observational precipitation data were used to estimate evaporation. The water balance for this specific water year also showed that the precipitation in the 1995 summer was due mainly to the moisture flux convergence into the MRB, instead of the evaporation found in other studies. Correlation coefficients between the moisture flux convergence and precipitation were much higher for this water year than in other studies. The horizontal distribution of the moisture flux convergence across the basin during this water year displayed a band of high values between the Rocky Mountains and Great Bear Lake and another band of high values at the southern edge of the basin, which is closely linked with the topography in the MRB.																			0705-5900	1480-9214				JUN	2002	40	2					101	111		10.3137/ao.400202	http://dx.doi.org/10.3137/ao.400202													WOS:000176257600003

Despite the hypertrophic status of BR, fisheries management shifted the planktivore-dominated fish community into a piscivore-dominated community. High winter (Jan-Mar) Daphnia biomass was a sensitive indicator of reduced planktivory. Although edible phytoplankton was suppressed by elevated Daphnia biomass, mean seasonal (May-Oct) total phytoplankton biomass remained unchanged due to growth of large inedible algae and cyanobacteria. Inedible and total phytoplankton biomass was primarily controlled by phosphorus availability. However, during clear water periods a reduction of total phytoplankton was achieved with drastically increased Secchi readings. In Feldberger Haussee (FH), despite intensive long-term manual removal of cyprinids (1985-2002) and stocking of piscivorous fish (1988-2002), biomanipulation only had restricted, delayed, or transient effects on the ecosystem. Mean proportion of piscivores within total yield increased but was below 20% in most years. Planktivore cyprinid yields dropped until 1990 and remained constant thereafter. Daphnia biomass slightly increased after biomanipulation became effective (1987-1989) but declined to pre-biomanipulation levels later in the experiment (1996-2005). Beginning in 1997, both edible and inedible phytoplankton biomass started to decrease. Finally, when biomanipulation had been implemented after a delay of 8 years water clarity increased significantly. Although external loading reductions and biomanipulation in both lakes resulted in moderate phytoplankton biomass reduction and Secchi depth enhancement, the reasons for the observed changes were different. Even though strong cascading effects were detected at the top of the food web in BR, the trophic cascade was largely decoupled between phyto- and zooplankton. External plus internal phosphorus loading still exceeded a critical threshold below which a top-down-induced indirect effect of phosphorus sedimentation and finally limitation could have reduced phytoplankton biomass. In constrast to BR, the critical phosphorus loading threshold in FH has probably been approached. Nonetheless, cascading effects were weak due to insufficient reduction of planktivorous cyprinids. Improved water quality was primarily a result of resource-related effects. Thus, the 2 long-term experiments reveal that (1) biomanipulation cannot be applied successfully without reducing nutrient loading below a critical threshold (BR), and (2) for successful biomanipulation, 30-40% piscivores within total fish standing stocks are required (BR and FH). Without optimum piscivory, manual removal of planktivores will hardly produce sustained cascading effects (FH).

J	Amidon, WH; Clark, AC				Amidon, William H.; Clark, Arthur C.			Interaction of outburst floods with basaltic aquifers on the Snake River Plain: Implications for Martian canyons	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												Idaho's Snake River Plain is underlain by a young sequence of basaltic lava flows that house one of the most conductive aquifers in the world and have been sculpted by at least three megafloods in the last similar to 100 k.y. The timing and routing of these floods, and their interaction with the underlying aquifer, have taken on renewed significance because they have carved amphitheater-headed dry canyons analogous to those found on Mars. In this study, we use cosmogenic He-3 and Ne-21 dating of flood-deposited boulders to show that the Big Lost River and Bonneville floods were closely spaced in time at ca. 22.3 and ca. 17.5 ka, respectively. Most of the dry canyons record significant erosion during the Big Lost River flood, despite its much smaller magnitude than the later Bonneville flood. We explain this puzzling observation by proposing a composite erosion model in which erosion during the Big Lost River flood was partially accomplished by routing of floodwaters through the Snake River Plain aquifer. Topographic analysis shows that Big Lost River floodwaters ponded in the Terreton Basin, infiltrated into the aquifer, and likely emerged as return flow in watersheds upstream of the dry canyons. We propose that sustained and focused erosion associated with return flow over months to years could explain the unique morphology of some dry canyons. Such a model also explains why most dry canyons are coincident with springs and surface watersheds, and it may provide a model for the way in which morphologically similar canyons evolved on Mars.																			0016-7606	1943-2674				MAY	2015	127	5-6					688	701		10.1130/B31141.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/B31141.1													WOS:000359009600004

The polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositolmannoside and two other unidentified phospholipids. The predominant menaquinones were MK-9(H-8), MK-9, MK-9(H-4) and MK-9(H-6). The major fatty acids were iso-C-16 : 0, anteiso-C-15 : 0, anteiso-C-17 : 0 and iso-C-16 : 1 H. Based on morphological and chemotaxonomic characteristics, the isolate was determined to belong to the genus Streptomyces. The phylogenetic tree based on its nearly complete 16S rRNA gene sequence (1498 nt) with representative strains showed that the strain consistently falls into a distinct phyletic lineage together with Streptomyces barkulensis DSM 42082(T) (97.48% similarity) and a subclade consisting of Streptomyces fenghuangensis GIMN 4.003(T) (97.20 %), Streptomyces macrosporus NBRC 14748(T) (97.14 %) and Streptomyces radiopugnans R97(T) (97.01 %). On the basis of these data, strain TRM 41337(T) should be designated as a representative of a novel species of the genus Streptomyces, for which the name Streptomyces salilacus sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is TRM 41337(T) (=CCTCC AA 2015030(T)=KCTC 39726(T)).

Hence, it has been a particular study field for hydrothermal systems and phreatic eruptions. On 23 January 2018, a phreatic eruption occurred at the Motoshirane cone of Kusatsu-Shirane, where no considerable volcanic activity had been reported in observational and historical records. To understand the eruption process of this unique event, we analyzed seismic, tilt, and infrasound records. The onset of surface activity accompanied by infrasound signal was preceded by volcanic tremor and inflation of the volcano for similar to 2 min. Tremor signals with a frequency band of 5-20 Hz remarkably coincide with the rapid inflation. We apply an amplitude source location method to seismic signals in the 5-20 Hz band to estimate tremor source locations. Our analysis locates tremor sources at 1 km north of Motoshirane and at a depth of 0.5-1 km from the surface. Inferred source locations correspond to a conductive layer of impermeable cap-rock estimated by magnetotelluric investigations. An upper portion of the seismogenic region suggests hydrothermal activity hosted beneath the cap-rock. Examined seismic signals in the 5-20 Hz band are typically excited by volcano-tectonic events with faulting mechanism. Based on the above characteristics and background, we interpret that excitation of examined volcanic tremor reflects small shear fractures induced by sudden hydrothermal fluid injection to the cap-rock layer. The horizontal distance of 1 km between inferred tremor sources and Motoshirane implies lateral migration of the hydrothermal fluid, although direct evidence is not available. Kusatsu-Shirane has exhibited unrest at the Yugama lake since 2014. However, the inferred tremor source locations do not overlap active seismicity beneath Yugama. Therefore, our result suggests that the 2018 eruption was triggered by hydrothermal fluid injection through a different pathway from that has driven unrest activities at Yugama.					; Aoyama, Hiroshi/F-8481-2012; Ogawa, Yasuo/B-4094-2009; Yamada, Taishi/JEZ-7143-2023	Kanda, Wataru/0000-0003-2874-3538; Ogawa, Yasuo/0000-0002-6663-401X; Yamada, Taishi/0000-0002-5919-9195; K Kurokawa, Aika/0000-0002-3113-4752; Terada, Akihiko/0000-0001-5746-4912														1880-5981				JAN 11	2021	73	1							14	10.1186/s40623-020-01349-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40623-020-01349-1													WOS:000609611700001
J	Wilhelm, MB; Hewson, I				Wilhelm, Mary Beth; Hewson, Ian			Characterization of Thrombolitic Bioherm Cyanobacterial Assemblages in a Meromictic Marl Lake (Fayetteville Green Lake, New York)	GEOMICROBIOLOGY JOURNAL												The Fayetteville Green Lake is a small (0.258 km(2)) meromictic marl lake that is host to a thrombolitic bioherm inhabited by coccoid and filamentous cyanobacteria. To date there has been only limited study of bioherm cyanobacterial community ecology, and none focusing on their molecular diversity. Samples of the bioherm were collected along vertical and spatial transects on a portion of the thrombolite in early fall 2010. Cyanobacterial assemblage spatial variability and operational taxonomic unit composition was analyzed by automated rRNA intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA). A total of 123 cyanobacterial ARISA operational taxonomic units were observed across all fingerprints. Cyanobacterial assemblages were variable across depth and spatial gradients, and may be structured by gradients in light availability and habitat stability. Cyanobacterial community fingerprints were more taxonomic unit rich, diverse, and had greater fingerprint similarity in deeper samples than those at the surface. Several operational taxonomic units were common to all samples taken, while the majority of assemblage components were heterogeneous between transects and depths. Hence, our results suggest that cyanobacterial communities on the thrombolite in Green Lake represent a mixture of taxa that are selected for by prevailing physicochemical conditions, while other taxa are selected for on spatial scales of meters and may represent more specialized cyanobacteria on the thrombolite. Moreover, our data suggest that the depth-dependent structure of bioherm cyanobacterial assemblages may be a consequence of habitat conditions, which may include light intensity and quality, temperature variation and habitat stability.

To investigate the response of freshwater environments to this warming and place it in a secular perspective, we analyzed a 90-cm-long sediment core from Nettilling Lake, the largest lake of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. The core was taken from a part of the lake basin that receives meltwater and sediment inputs from the nearby Penny Ice Cap. The core time scale, established using Cs-137 and palaeomagnetic techniques, spans an estimated 600years. A multi-proxy approach was used to document changes in the physical, chemical, and biological properties of the sediments. We found evidence for a relatively warm period (mid/late 15th century to mid/late 16th century) during the early part of the Little Ice Age' (LIA), characterized by high sedimentation rates and laminations. This was followed by colder, drier, and windier conditions corresponding to the coldest phase of LIA and coinciding with the latest and most extensive period of regional ice cap expansion (early 16th to late 19th centuries). A rapid warming occurred at the beginning of the 20th century. Variations in titanium (Ti) content in the core, a proxy for detrital sediment inputs, showed good agreement with reconstructed secular variations in summer melt rates on Penny Ice Cap between the mid-14th century and the present-day, providing supporting evidence for a climatic-hydrological connection between the ice cap and Nettilling Lake.

J	Mann, ME; Lees, JM				Mann, ME; Lees, JM			Robust estimation of background noise and signal detection in climatic time series	CLIMATIC CHANGE												We present a new technique for isolating climate signals in time series with a characteristic 'red' noise background which arises from temporal persistence. This background is estimated by a 'robust' procedure that, unlike conventional techniques, is largely unbiased by the presence of signals immersed in the noise. Making use of multiple-taper spectral analysis methods, the technique further provides for a distinction between purely harmonic (periodic) signals, and broader-band ('quasiperiodic') signals. The effectiveness of our signal detection procedure is demonstrated with synthetic examples that simulate a variety of possible periodic and quasiperiodic signals immersed in red noise. We apply our methodology to historical climate and paleoclimate time series examples. Analysis of a approximate to 3 million year sediment core reveals significant periodic components at known astronomical forcing periodicities and a significant quasiperiodic 100 year peak. Analysis of a roughly 1500 year tree-ring reconstruction of Scandinavian summer temperatures suggests significant quasiperiodic signals on a near-century timescale, an interdecadal 16-18 year timescale, within the interannual El Ninio/Southem Oscillation (ENSO) band, and on a quasibiennial timescale. Analysis of the 144 year record of Great Salt Lake monthly volume change reveals a significant broad band of significant interdecadal variability, ENSO-timescale peaks, an annual cycle and its harmonics. Focusing in detail on the historical estimated global-average surface temperature record, we find a highly significant secular trend relative to the estimated red noise background, and weakly significant quasiperiodic signals within the ENSO band. Decadal and quasibiennial signals are marginally significant in this series.

Alpine waterbodies, such as ponds, are particularly vulnerable to changes in temperature. Their biodiversity faces rising threats, especially for cold stenothermal species. Located at high elevation (>2600 m a.s.l.), the aquatic network of the Macun catchment (35 ponds and several streams) was put under a strict protection framework in 2000 ("Swiss National Park") to mitigate threats to alpine biodiversity. The pond network has been regularly monitored as a sentinel of change, through aquatic macroinvertebrate sampling and physico-chemical measurements. Monitoring shows an alarmingly sharp increase in summer water temperature, rising by 4 C-degrees between 2005 and 2020 (2.7 C-degrees per decade). In contrast, nutrient concentrations have remained low and stable over these 15 years. The aquatic macroinvertebrate species richness has also been mostly stable between 2002 and 2021, with no negative impacts on the monitored cold stenotherms. Indeed, as the ponds are located at high elevation, these cold stenotherms are still living within their thermal range. Some cold stenothermal species have colonised the ponds from lower elevations, so the Macun pondscape acts as a refuge for these migrating taxa. In synthesis, our investigation highlights the alarming abiotic condition of the high -elevation freshwater biodiversity habitats, including a sharp temperature increase. It also provides evidence that their high elevation allows theses waterbodies to remain refuges for cold stenotherms, for now. In the longer term, however, a tipping point is likely to be reached, with a potential collapse of cold stenothermal biodiversity. This demonstrates the critical need to continue longer -term monitoring of high -elevation ecosystems to assess the magnitude of the impairment and to implement suitable conservation strategies, such as enhanced protection or the creation of new suitable habitats.					; Fahy, Julie/AGA-4651-2022	Fahy, Julie/0000-0002-4465-321X; 													0006-3207	1873-2917				FEB	2024	290								110461	10.1016/j.biocon.2024.110461	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2024.110461		JAN 2024											WOS:001176151500001
J	Long, AJ; Roberts, DH; Wright, MR				Long, AJ; Roberts, DH; Wright, MR			Isolation basin stratigraphy and Holocene relative sea-level change on Arveprinsen Ejland, Disko Bugt, West Greenland	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												This paper presents the results of an investigation into Holocene relative sea-level (RSL) change, isostatic rebound and ice sheet dynamics in Disko Bugt, West Greenland. Data collected from nine isolation basins on Arveprinsen Ejland, east Disko Bugt, show that mean sea level fell continuously from ca. 70 m at 9.9 ka cat. yr BP (8.9 ka C-14 yr BP) to reach a minimum of ca. -5 m at 2.8 ka cal. yr BP (2.5 ka C-14 yr BP), before rising to the present day. A west-east gradient in isostatic uplift across Disko Bugt is confirmed, with reduced rebound observed in east Disko Bugt. However, RSL differences (up to 20 m at 7.8 ka to 6.8 ka cat. yr BP (7 ka to 6 ka C-14 yr BP)) also exist within east Disko Bugt, suggesting a significant north-south component to the area's isostatic history. The observed magnitude and timing of late Holocene RSL rise is not compatible with regional forebulge collapse. Instead, RSL rise began first in the eastern part of the bay, as might be expected under a scenario of crustal subsidence caused by neoglacial ice sheet readvance. The results of this study demonstrate the potential of isolation basin data for local and regional RSL studies in Greenland, and the importance of avoiding data compilations from areas where the isobase orientation is uncertain.

J	MILLER, RB				MILLER, RB			THE COLLAPSE AND RECOVERY OF A SMALL WHITEFISH FISHERY	JOURNAL OF THE FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD OF CANADA												Pigeon Lake, Alberta, is a shallow eutrophic lake with a sandy basin, gentle contours and an area of 40 square miles. It contains whitefish, pike, yellow walleye, perch, burbot, white suckers and spottail shiners. The whitefish have been commercially exploited for many years and catch statistics are available from 1918. In 1941 a greatly increased catch of whitefish was permitted. Large annual yields continued until 1946; in 1947, in spite of considerable effort, a very small catch was made. Since this collapse fishing was prohibited in two years and light in two years. The lake now contains a normal whitefish population. Samples of the commercial catch during this period showed that the average age of the fish fell from 5.1 to 2.3 years, then, after collapse, increased to 5.7 years. Growth rates increased greatly, then decreased to the original level. Age at maturity decreased from five to two years. Calculations of the number of fish each year-class contributed to the fishery reveal that the collapse of the fishery was not due to overfishing; the weak year-classes which caused the collapse had parent year-classes of normal abundance. It is suggested that egg destruction by strong winds may have caused the weak year-classes.																									1956	13	1					135	146		10.1139/f56-008	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f56-008													WOS:A1956WX36400008

To explore the interactive effects of hydrological characteristics, physicochemical parameters and phytoplankton FGs in the largest river-connected lake, a case study was carried out at Dongting Lake, China. We analyzed the changes in the hydrological characteristics of the lake as well as in the phytoplankton biomass throughout the year to explore the driving factors that influence phytoplankton FGs. Four periods were defined in our study based on water level (WL) fluctuations including the rising periods (RI and RII) and the falling periods (FI and FII). The phytoplankton biomass in Dongting Lake was the highest in RII, followed by RI, FI, and FII. And the trend of FGs dominance through the four periods were P/MP/D (RI)-* P/ MP/J (RII)-* MP (FI)-* MP/P/Y (FII). Changes in phytoplankton biomass and FGs were the result of a com-bination of hydrological characteristics and physicochemical parameters. Throughout the water period, the hydrological characteristics did not directly influence phytoplankton, instead exerting a more indirect effect on phytoplankton biomass and FGs by affecting the water's physicochemical parameters, e.g., permanganate index (CODMn), nitrogen nutrients, dissolved oxygen (DO), water temperature (WT), and conductivity (Cond). CODMn might be a significant predictor of phytoplankton biomass and FGs in all water periods, explaining 36.6% of the variability, followed by Cond, WT, ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N), and DO explaining 17.6%, 12.3%, 11.3%, and 7.2%, respectively. However, according to each water phase analysis, the WL was the key factor for phyto-plankton growth in RII. Nitrogen nutrients, WT and Cond had more pronounced effects on phytoplankton in RI, FI and FII, respectively., Based on the findings of our study, we suggest that increased control of organic matter input into the lake and nitrogen fertilizer use at nearby agricultural surface sources are effective actions that are needed to prevent and control algal blooms in Dongting Lake.					; Li, Dan/JZD-2398-2024	Dan, Li/0000-0002-3665-5354; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				MAY	2023	149								110177	10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110177	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110177		MAR 2023											WOS:000967717400001

The nested system is forced by monthly mean surface heat flux and 12-hourly wind stress computed from wind speeds extracted from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) 40-year reanalysis data. The three-dimensional model currents are used to calculate the retention and dispersion of conservative, near-surface particles carried by the currents. The near-surface dispersion is relatively low in Saginaw Bay, eastern Georgian Bay and the eastern North Channel; and relatively high over the western part of the main lake and the coastal region of south Lake Huron. The hydrodynamic connectivity in the surface water and connectivity matrices are calculated from particle movements carried passively by model currents superposed by a random walk process. The model results demonstrate that the hydrodynamic connectivity in the North Channel and Georgian Bay (ranging from 0.9 to 2.2%) is much weaker than those in the main lake (5.3 to 21.9%).																			1201-3080						2012	47	3-4					238	251		10.2166/wqrjc.2012.121	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wqrjc.2012.121													WOS:000314819000005
J	Touchart, L; Bouny, J				Touchart, Laurent; Bouny, Jerome			Phytoplankton geographic spatialization in two ponds in Limousin (France)	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												Phytoplankton distribution was not homogeneous among Limousin ponds and within each pond, as shown by chlorophyll a and diatoms in two representative eutrophic ponds. On a small cartographic scale, differences depended on geographic location and water temperature. Spring bloom occurred with a time-lag of several weeks in the highland pond. On a large-scale geographic distribution depended on hydroclimatic factors, especially wind direction and inflow of the rivers. The high concentrations of chlorophyll a near the dam of the water bodies roughly coincided with the maximum fetch and the direction of the dominant winds during the investigations. In both ponds the heaviest algae seemed not to be influenced by wind currents and the greater number of diatoms upstream in the highland pond was probably due to inflow of silica from the river. Phytoplankton mapping is more explanatory and rigorous than Secchi disk transparency mapping, it is useful to the regional authorities for zoning activities: bathing should be avoided in bays and along longitudinal shores, fishing location may be less restrictive. In plateau regions in general phytoplankton is not randomly distributed and spatial heterogeneity of ponds is not only vertical but also horizontal. Deep and embanked ponds are complex organisms analogous to great lakes for some features and to shallow water bodies for other ones.

Gross conversion efficiencies were not significantly different among treatments, indicating little, if any, energetic penalty for exposure to large or small diel temperature fluctuations. Brown trout exposed to a constant 13.degree. C accumulated less total lipid (whole body) and deposited a lower proportion of lipids in muscle than fish in the fluctuating temperature regimes.

Merr.] in North Carolina (USA). These soils have an available water holding capacity of only 4.0% on a weight basis and as a result require about 2.5 cm of water every 5 to 6 days during the growing season to produce acceptable crop yields. In addition, Lakeland sands usually have extremely low or a totally nonexistent indigenous population of R. japonicum. Information on irrigation and nodulation effects is needed to make these soils more productive. The objectives of this study were to investigate the influence of irrigation and inoculation with different R. japonicum strains on yields of soybeans grown in a Lakeland sand. The study was conducted at the Sandhills Research Station at Jackson Springs, North Carolina. Additional nonirrigated plots inoculated with strains 31, 110 and 122 were initiated on finer textured North Carolina soils for comparative purposes to the Lakeland sand. Soil moisture treatments included plots not irrigated and plots irrigated each week with 2.5 cm of water. The 5 inoculation treatments consisted of a set of noninoculated plots and plots inoculated with strains of R. japonicum representing serogroups 31, 76, 110, and 122 at the rate of 50 .times. 106 cells per cm of soybean row. Numbers of soil rhizobia were monitored throughout the study using a plant infection and most portable number technique. Irrigated soybean seed yields were significantly greater when inoculated with rhizobia of either serogroup 110 or 122 than yields from noninoculated but irrigated plots. Inoculation without irrigation did not increase soybean yields. It was also observed that inoculated, irrigated soybeans had greater nodule mass and numbers of nodules than the nonirrigated and/or noninoculated plots. All 4 serogroups used in the study adequately nodulated soybean roots under irrigation and produced fewer nodules on soybean roots in the nonirrigated plots. On the basis of seed yield, strain ranking from best to worst was: 122 > 110 > 31 > 76. The noninoculated controls yielded higher than serogroup 76 but less than those soybeans in plots inoculated with serogroup isolate 31.

We investigated aspects of osmoregulation in D. villosus to determine whether it Could adjust altered salinity. D. villosus maintained relatively constant haemolymph Na+ concentration up to all acclimation salinily of 10 parts per thousand. and haemolymph K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ Concentration up to a salinity of 16 parts per thousand. Increasing acclimation salinity above 16 parts per thousand induced sharp increases in haemolymph cation concentrations, suggesting osmoregulatory dysfunction. Both sodium influx and the half time of exchange of water (t(1/2)) fell with increasing acclimation salinity. In addition. Sudden transfer of freshwater acclimated D. villosus to 20 parts per thousand produced a rapid reduction in sodium influx to the rate found in amphipods acclimated to 20 parts per thousand. This indicates that D. villosus call regulate water permeability and sodium influx. both of which are important osmoregulatory mechanisms in euryhaline gammarids.

It is therefore recommended that complete mid ocean ballast water exchange is practiced, to reduce the risk of introduction of D. villosus to areas currently free of this amphipod, e.g. North America and the Great Lakes.

They are often used to provide water for various activities related with recreational (i.e. skiing) and production activities. Many of such reservoirs are threatened by snow avalanches. To investigate the phenomenon, an experimental study was carried out at the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne using a prismatic 3m-long flume. A mass of buoyant particles, initially at rest, was released into a water flume down a 30 degrees-sloping ramp. Its impact with the water surface was analyzed in detail. During the tests, the impacting mass, the water depth in the flume and the ramp length were changed. Both the dynamics of the granular mass at the impact zone and the wave generation induced by the impact were acquired using a high-frequency camera and accurately analyzed. An analysis of the wave propagation along the flume, also captured by two lower-speed cameras, was made by mean of numerical analyses based on a depth-averaged Boussinesq-type model. A theoretical analysis has also been undertaken to assess how the sub-aerial mass dynamics influences energy dissipation, and to identify the key variables of the problem, i.e. the velocity at impact, the shape of the water volume displaced during the impact, the depth of the center of the submerged mass and the percentage of submerged mass.

Assessment of metallic pollution status of surface water and aquatic macrophytes of earthen dams in Ilorin, north-central of Nigeria as indicators of environmental health	JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY SCIENCE												The functional quality of an aquatic ecosystem is a reflection of the health of the environment. Therefore, the present study evaluates the trace metal contamination (Pb, Cd, Ni and Mn) of water and aquatic macrophytes in Asa, Agba, Unilorin and Sobi (Moro) earthen dams, north-central Nigeria to evaluate the level of anthropogenic impact on the immediate environment. The concentrations of trace metals in samples of water and available macrophytes from the earthen dams were determined by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry. Trace metal contamination of surface water in the earthen dams was assessed using metal index (MPI) and metal pollution index (HPI). The biological accumulation factor of trace metals in the aquatic macrophytes was extrapolated from trace metal concentrations in the water and macrophyte samples. The results of the MPI revealed gross metal contamination of the surface water by Pb and Cd (> 6.0 for both metals) in the four earthen dams; while Agba and Sobi dams were slightly contaminated by Ni (MPIs = 1.43 and 1.14 respectively). All the earthen dams were considered safe from Mn contamination (MPI < 1.0). Considering the HPI, the four earthen dams fall within the critical pollution threshold for trace metals (HPI > 100), but Asa dam (HPI = 2682.4) was the most contaminated. The biological accumulation factor of Mn in the macrophytes indicated Ceratophyllum demersum, Pycreus lanceolatus and Pistia stratiotes as moderate accumulators of Mn, and can be used as bioindicators in monitoring Mn pollution of aquatic ecosystem. The obtained results in this study showed that the earthen dams are polluted by Pb, Cd and Ni which pose human health risks to the inhabitants through drinking water. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Merging geospatial and field data to predict the distribution and abundance of an exotic macrophyte in a large Wisconsin reservoir	AQUATIC BOTANY												Geospatial and field data were merged to characterize the invasion of an exotic macrophyte into a large (similar to 6192 ha), reservoir, the Chippewa Flowage, Wisconsin, USA. Multi-scale analyses provided data for quantitative models of human, abiotic and biotic influences that would explain the presence and abundance of Myriophyllum spicatum L, a widespread, aquatic species. Human and abiotic factors were analysed in a geographic information system and additional abiotic and biotic factors were sampled at 2778 sample points. Using multivariate logistic and multiple linear regressions the relationships between 29 factors and the species' presence and abundance were quantified. M. spicatum occurred at 181 of 992 vegetated points. M. spicatum abundance was significantly influenced by two geospatial variables (wave action and water-level drawdown) and two site variables (water depth and native species presence). Separate models for shallow and deep water explained 32% and 30% of M. spicatum abundance, respectively (compared to 22.8% using all 181 points). The species' vertical distribution (range = 0.30-4.27 m) was related to depth of winter drawdown (similar to 1.3 m on average) and to water depth (an indicator of decreasing light), as well as to shading by floating-leaved macrophytes. Spatial extrapolation of model predictions for M. spicatum presence indicated that a total 940 hectares are at risk for M. spicatum invasion (similar to 15% of the Chippewa Flowage; about 2.5 times larger than the current distribution).

Bloom samples (n = 50) were collected from Finnish freshwater sites during summer months of 2002 and 2003. These samples were screened for the presence of paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) using the Jellett rapid PSP screening test. Samples testing positive for PSTs (n = 7) were further analyzed with saxiphilin- and voltage-gated sodium channel [H-3]-STX-binding radioreceptor assays and liquid chromatography using fluorescence and mass spectrometric analysis. The results indicated that saxitoxin (STX) was the only PST analogue in the samples and that it was present in high concentrations, as much as 1 mg L-1. Microscopic analysis revealed that 95%-100% of the phytoplankton in the positive samples consisted of Anabaena lemmermannii. The trophic status of lakes in which STX-containing blooms were found varied from oligotrophic to hypertrophic. All the lakes had high nitrogen-to-phosphorus ratios. In some instances, samples had been collected from sites where swimmers had reported adverse health effects, and in three such cases, reported adverse health effects were associated with sites from which samples testing positive for STX had been received. Symptoms of fever, eye irritation, abdominal pains, and skin rash were reported in children aged 2-10 years after exposure to the water. These were not the adverse human symptoms typical of STX poisoning; rather, they represented acute effects often reported following recreational exposure to cyanobacterial blooms.

Ecosystem stability is less common in smaller, more sensitive lakes, such as those within volcanic craters, where external impacts can cause abrupt and rapid fluctuations. A 4100-year diatom and cyanobacteria pigment record from Lake Massoko, a volcanic crater lake in southern Tanzania, is used to illustrate important switches in resource ratios following tephra deposition 1190 years ago. It is hypothesized that the tephra reduced the rate of P diffusion from the sediments and increased the Si:P ratio in the lake. A period of acute change in planktonic diatom communities resulted from the tephra impact and lasted c. 110 years. The magnitude of the change shown by the diatoms and their slow recovery from the tephra may be due in part to a coincident fall in lake level caused by a reduction in regional rainfall. The statistical significance of the tephra impact relative to that of catchment and climate change has been tested using variance partitioning and rate-of-change analysis. Multiproxy indicators show an important period of positive water balance 1700 ago and a relatively dry episode persisting between 1000 and 400 years ago. The lake ecosystem is shown to be highly sensitive to both climate change and tephra deposition.

J	Costelloe, JF; Irvine, EC; Western, AW; Tyler, M				Costelloe, Justin F.; Irvine, Elizabeth C.; Western, Andrew W.; Tyler, Murray			Identifying fluvial recharge and artesian upwards leakage contributions to arid zone shallow, unconfined groundwater	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Evaporation losses from unconfined groundwater can form an important part of the water balance of arid zone groundwater systems. However, in artesian groundwater systems, the discrimination between artesian leakage and surface recharge contributions to the unconfined water table is required. We use hydrochemical analysis techniques and isotopic data to investigate the provenance of unconfined groundwater in zones of artesian discharge along the margin of the Great Artesian Basin (GAB) of Australia. Forward modelling of evapoconcentration and use of trilinear plots identified unconfined groundwater that was largely derived from fluvial recharge, compared to upwards artesian leakage, particularly in areas where the artesian groundwater had a Na-HCO3-Cl composition in contrast to the Na-Cl-SO4 composition more typical of arid zone meteoric recharge. Mixing models, combined with forward evapoconcentration models, confirmed that the contribution of artesian groundwater was minimal in areas of Na-Cl-SO4 unconfined groundwater underlain by Na-HCO3-Cl artesian groundwater. However, the evaporation modelling was still useful in identifying probable artesian versus meteoric contributions from Na-Cl-SO4 composition artesian groundwater Stable isotope data were consistent with the unconfined groundwater being evapoconcentrated from the artesian groundwater end-member and were unable to discriminate between contributions from fluvial recharge and artesian discharge. The hydrochemical analysis techniques can assist in water balance studies of aquifers with Na-HCO3-Cl composition groundwater discharging into semi-arid and arid environments, in addition to identifying areas of local fluvial recharge.

J	Köykkä, J				Koykka, Juha			Precambrian alluvial fan and braidplain sedimentation patterns: Example from the Mesoproterozoic Rjukan Rift Basin, southern Norway	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												An integrated approach of facies analysis, geochemistry and paleohydrology provides new insight into the sedimentology and paleogeography of alluvial sediments in the Precambrian. Here, alluvial fan and braidplain sedimentation patterns are documented in a Mesoproterozoic rift basin, called (known as) the Rjukan Rift Basin in southern Norway. The studied formation (Heddersvatnet Formation) consists of volcanoclastic breccias and conglomerates, cross-bedded sandstones with associated mudstones, and subaerial basaltic lava beds, deposited in a rift basin during the syn-rifting phase. Based on genetically related major lithofacies associations and individual minor lithofacies, the sedimentation is characterized by colluvial and screen apron deposits, subaerial debris flows, hyperconcentrated or sheet flood deposits in the proximal part, representing waning-flood cycles. The distal part contains shallow-water traction current deposits and associated subaerial continental flood basalts that flowed down the rift valleys. The synsedimentary intra-rift faulting formed seasonal or climatically controlled, intrafan ponded-lake with playa lake type cycles and shrinkage cracks. The geochemical composition of the of the studied sandstones and mudstones suggests a passive rifted continental margin with minor to moderate chemical weathering, possible in a semi-arid/arid paleoclimate. Clastic petrofacies of the sandstones indicate a locally uplifted and syn-rift paleotectonic setting during the main sedimentation stage, passing toward a post-rifting stage of the depositional basin. Small-scale structures within the sedimentary basin affected the depositional patterns of the Heddersvatnet Formation by creating local sites of uplift and erosion, controlling the sediment transport, and defining the accommodation space for deposition. The sedimentation of the Heddersvatnet Formation reflects a tectonic base level fall, which resulted in an accumulation of thick alluvial fan or braidplain sediments near uplifted flank(s) of the sedimentary basin. This was combined with intensive erosion of the basement in the pre-vegetation landscape, which resulted in changes in the hydraulic geometry of flow and sediment discharge of stream channels. The following criteria, observed from the Heddersvatnet Formation, are suggestive of an ancient alluvial fan and associated braidplain sedimentation: (1) deposition close to the source area; (2) slightly divergent paleoflows; (3) high-energy flows with waning flood-cycles; (4) abundance of poorly sorted and laterally extensive subaerial debris flows, and related streamflows, possible sheetfloods, hyperconcentrated flows, and their associations; (5) great distribution of grain size and lithofacies changes in proximal vs. distal parts; (6) limited suite of sedimentary structures (cross-stratification, ripple-marks, and desiccanation cracks); (7) fault bounded basin (graben) with hanging wall close to uplifted flank(s); (8) paleoslope estimation indicating at least moderate paleotopographic highs; (9) colluvial and scree apron breccias; (10) lack of any typical braided stream channel fill conglomerates and floodplains; and (11) channelized sediment bodies lacking extensive lateral continuity.

Deep Learning for Dense Labeling of Hydrographic Regions in Very High Resolution Imagery	IMAGE AND SIGNAL PROCESSING FOR REMOTE SENSING XXV	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Image and Signal Processing for Remote Sensing XXV	SEP 09-11, 2019	Strasbourg, FRANCE	SPIE				Automatic dense labeling of multispectral satellite images facilitates faster map update process. Water objects are essential elements of a geographic map. While modern dense labeling methods perform robust segmentation of such objects like roads, buildings, and vegetation, dense labeling of hydrographic regions remains a challenging problem. Water objects change their surface albedo, color, and reflection in different weather and different seasons. Moreover, rivers and lakes can change their boundaries after floods or d roughts. Robust documentation of such seasonal changes is an essential task in the field of analysis of satellite imagery. Due to the high variance in water object appearance, their segmentation is usually performed manually by a human operator. Recent advances in machine learning have made possible robust segmentation of static objects such as buildings and roads. To the best of our knowledge, there is little research in the modern literature regarding dense labeling of water regions. This paper is focused on the development of a deep-learning-based method for dense labeling of hydrographic in aerial and satellite imagery. We use the GeoGAN framework(1) and MobileNetV2(2) as the starting point for our research. The GeoGAN framework uses an aerial image as an input to generate pixel-level annotations of five object c lasses: building, low vegetation, high vegetation, road, and car. The GeoGAN framework leverages two deep learning approaches to ensure robust labeling: a generator with skip connections(3) and Generative Adversarial Networks.(4) A generator with skip connections performs image -> label translation using feed-forward connections between convolutional and deconvolutional layers of the same depth. A GAN framework consists of two competing networks: a generator and a discriminator. The adversarial loss improves the quality of the resulting dense labeling. We made the following contributions to the GeoGAN framework: (1) new MobileNetV2-based generator, (2) adversarial loss function. We term the resulting framework as HydroGAN. We evaluate our HydroGAN model using a new HydroViews dataset focused on dense labeling of areas that are subject to severe flooding during the spring season. The evaluation results are encouraging and demonstrate that our HydroGAN model competes with the state-of-the-art models for dense labeling of aerial and satellite imagery. The evaluation demonstrates that our model can generalize from the training data to previously unseen samples. The developed HydroGAN model is capable of performing dense labeling of water objects in different seasons. We made our model publicly available*.

Role of Benthic Substrate in Waterbird Distribution on Great Salt Lake, Utah	WATERBIRDS												Benthic substrate has a large impact on aquatic plant and invertebrate assemblages and likely directly or indirectly influences waterbird distributions. The association of birds with various substrates can be important in survey design or habitat management. Northern Shoveler (Anas clypeata), Common Goldeneye (Bucephala clangula), Eared Grebe (Podiceps nigricollis), Ring-billed Gull (Larus delawarensis) and California Gull (L. californicus) densities on the hypersaline Great Salt Lake, Utah, were estimated to determine the association of bird distributions with benthic substrates. Three of the four groups of species monitored had densities that varied by benthic substrate; gulls were the exception. Eared Grebes occurred at the highest densities over calcareous reef-like structures known as bioherms, either as a result of ideal water depths for foraging or greater prey densities, than over other substrates. The highest densities of Northern Shovelers and Common Goldeneyes were observed Over mud substrates. This was likely due to mud being common near freshwater inflow sites and in lower salinity bays, areas waterfowl concentrate in because of the lower osmoregulatory demands compared to more pelagic areas of the Great Salt Lake. Knowing the relationship between waterbird densities and substrate will help managers estimate avian populations on hypersaline lakes.																			1524-4695	1938-5390				SEP	2014	37	3					298	306		10.1675/063.037.0308	http://dx.doi.org/10.1675/063.037.0308													WOS:000342476000007

Mixing and internal dynamics of a medium-size and deep lake near the Arctic Circle	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The goal of the research was to identify the mixing features that distinguish wind forced, medium-size fjord-type lakes near the Arctic Circle from systems of similar geometry, but in a temperate climate. Experimental data and the results of 3D numerical hydrodynamic simulations were analyzed for Lake Lagarfljot (27 km long; 2 km wide; 110 m maximum depth; 65 degrees N) during the 5-month ice-free period in 2009. The results showed that probably the most distinctive feature of arctic lakes is their low water column stability, one order of magnitude lower than that of mid-latitude lakes, even in mid-summer. The second characteristic is the high rate of energy imparted by wind in the Arctic, estimated as one order of magnitude larger than in a temperate climate. Frequent wind events with Lake and Wedderburn numbers below 1 occurred during the ice-free period, leading to a strong shear at the base of the surface mixed-layer and the upwelling of deep metalimnetic layers. As a result, nearly continuous density stratification developed in the shallowest 70 m of the water column, and longitudinal temperature gradients may therefore be very significant. On average, 15% of the wind forcing drove large-scale internal motions. This energy was rapidly dissipated, partly as a result of stronger bottom velocities, nonlinear surges, and hydraulic jumps that repeatedly formed in the lake. The initial V1H1 setup rapidly evolved into spatially complex oscillatory modes, which, given the high latitude, are affected by the Earth's rotation, even in narrow basins.

In this study, we have revealed the changes in the surface area and volume of Burdur Lake by using satellite images. Dams and ponds built on the springs feeding the lake, combined with climate change, have caused dramatic changes in the lake area. Temperature, precipitation, and city (center) population data that can be an indicator of these changes are provided and their relations with the changes in the lake are explained by expressing them over the years. By using the pixel values of the satellite images of the past years, time series analysis was performed for both the surface area and the volume values. The Arima model was used for time series analysis. Results of the time series analysis conducted for the Burdur lake predicted that the lake volume will decrease to 0 in the 2070s. On the other hand, as a result of the time series analysis for the surface area, it was seen that the existing areas decreased dramatically in 2100. It is thought that these decreases in the lake are caused by the unconscious use of water resources feeding the lake for agricultural irrigation and climate change. Time series analyses related to volume data were conducted using bathymetric. In other words, time series analysis was performed with two different datasets. Therefore, the results obtained between surface area and volume are similar but different from each other.					; Ozdemir, Serkan/AAF-9213-2021; Mert, Ahmet/AAG-4941-2019	MERT, Ahmet/0000-0001-6859-0308; Ozdemir, Serkan/0000-0002-9425-3724; 													0255-660X	0974-3006				APR	2025	53	4					1025	1036		10.1007/s12524-024-02008-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12524-024-02008-8		SEP 2024											WOS:001437355000001
J	Zhou, TY; Hill, TR; Roden, EE; Xu, HF				Zhou, Tianyu; Hill, Tina R.; Roden, Eric E.; Xu, Huifang			The felsic volcanism associated BIF-like iron formations: Their origin and implication for BIFs	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												The Banded Iron Formations (BIFs) have been invaluable archives for the Precambrian eons, providing evidence for the paleoenvironment conditions, including the atmospheric oxygen levels. This study explores the geological origin and depositional mechanism of BIF-like Carboniferous Heiyingshan (HYS) and Mesoproterozoic Pilot Knob hematite (PKH) formations, characterized by hematite-rich (Fe-rich) layer and quartz-rich (Si-rich) jasper layer alternations within felsic volcanic rocks. Through comprehensive mineralogical analyses and geochemical modeling, we present evidence supporting their formation in intra-caldera hot spring lakes, where episodic inputs of Fe(H3SiO4)2-bearing fluids mixed with ambient lake water. Experimental simulations and PHREEQC modeling corroborate a mechanism where ferrihydrite and amorphous silica precursors sequentially precipitate, possibly driven by the oxidation and decomposition rates of Fe(H3SiO4)2 complexes. The sharp or gradational change in the Fe- and Si-rich layering transition can be caused by varying atmospheric oxygen levels. The Carboniferous HYS specimen exhibits a sharp Fe-Si boundary that is in accordance with modeling under high atmospheric O2 condition. In contrast, the Mesoproterozoic PKH sample contains both sharp and gradual change in the Fe-Si transition, implying the pO2 lies between 10-3 and 10-5.

The occurrence of trans-1,10-dimethyltrans-9-decalol (GSM) and 2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB) is a common issue in surface water, such as lakes and reservoirs, resulting from algae bloom, which exacerbates the odor problems in summer. To address this issue, a combined process of biological aerated filter (BAF) and ultrafiltration was investigated in its efficacy in removing odor compounds under different concentrations and in achieving drinking water standards. Our results indicate that the combined process was effective, achieving abatement of turbidity and organic matter and, specifically, a removal rate of up to 96.5 % for GSM and similar to 100 % for 2-MIB at an influent concentration of 100 ng/L, a concentration commonly associated with odor issues in rural areas. Possible biodegradation pathways of odor compounds are also discussed. Increasing the air-to-water ratio to 5:1 in the combined system greatly improved the removal rate of odor compounds, enabling it to treat raw water with concentrations as high as 300 ng/L for both GSM and 2-MIB. This combined system holds great practical potential in addressing odor issues in rural areas, offering the capability to provide safe, clean, and odor-free drinking water, thereby significantly enhancing the quality of life especially in rural communities.					; Tiraferri, Alberto/HMP-6954-2023; Liu, Baicang/V-6193-2017	Tiraferri, Alberto/0000-0001-9859-1328; 													1383-5866	1873-3794				AUG 21	2024	342								126991	10.1016/j.seppur.2024.126991	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seppur.2024.126991		MAR 2024											WOS:001218358700001

Constraining the Early Eruptive History of the Mono Craters Rhyolites, California, Based on 238U-230Th Isochron Dating of Their Explosive and Effusive Products	GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS												The Mono Craters are an overlapping chain of at least 28 domes and coulees located south of Mono Lake, east central California, and represent the most recent eruptions of high-silica rhyolite magma in the Mono Lake-Long Valley volcanic region. Regionally widespread tephra fall deposits from the Mono Craters serve as important chronostratigraphic markers for correlations of late Quaternary terrestrial archives in the western United States. A well-resolved eruption chronology for the Mono Craters is thus not only critical for volcanic hazard considerations but also for paleoclimatic and paleomagnetic studies. Here we constrain the timing of early Mono Craters volcanism using ion microprobe U-238-Th-230 dating of unpolished crystal faces of autocrystic zircon and allanite microphenocrysts, which samples the final stage of crystallization prior to eruption. The stratigraphically oldest domes (biotite-bearing rhyolites) yield U-238-Th-230 isochron dates between ca. 42 and ca. 19ka and are unambiguously linked to dated tephras in the Wilson Creek formation of ancestral Mono Lake via coupled U-238-Th-230 geochronology and titanomagnetite geochemistry. The second oldest set of domes (orthopyroxene-bearing rhyolites) have overlapping U-238-Th-230 isochron dates that are within uncertainty of published K/Ar and 40Ar/39Ar dates for the fayalite-bearing rhyolite domes, suggesting a period of intense effusive activity for the Mono Craters near the Pleistocene-Holocene boundary. Our new and previously published U-238-Th-230 dates for tephras in the Wilson Creek formation provide robust geochronologic constraints for the controversial geomagnetic excursion recorded in the Wilson Creek formation.

J	Rodbell, DT; Seltzer, GO				Rodbell, DT; Seltzer, GO			Rapid ice margin fluctuations during the Younger Dryas in the tropical Andes	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Radiocarbon dated lacustrine sequences in Peru show that the chronology of glaciation during the late glacial in the tropical Andes was significantly out-of-phase with the record of climate change in the North Atlantic region. Fluvial incision of glacial-lake deposits in the Cordillera Blanca, central Peru, has exposed a glacial outwash gravel; radiocarbon dates from peat stratigraphically bounding the gravel imply that a glacier advance culminated between similar to 11,280 and 10,990 C-14 yr B.P.; rapid ice recession followed. Similarly, in southern Peru, ice readvanced between similar to 11,500 and 10,900 C-14 yr B.P. as shown by a basal radiocarbon date of similar to 10,870 C-14 yr B.P. from a lake within 1 ion of the Quelccaya Ice Cap. By 10,900 C-14 yr B.P, the ice front had retreated to nearly within its modern limits. Thus, glaciers in central and southern Peru advanced and retreated in near lockstep with one another. The Younger Dryas in the Peruvian Andes was apparently marked by retreating ice fronts in spite of the cool conditions that are inferred from the partial derivative O-18 record of Sajama ice. This retreat was apparently driven by reduced precipitation, which is consistent with interpretations of other paleoclimatic indicators from the region and which may have been a nonlinear response to steadily decreasing summer insolation.

Paco			Holocene paleohydrology from alpine lake sediment, Emerald Lake, Wasatch Plateau of central Utah, USA	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Holocene sediments at Emerald Lake in central Utah (3090 m asl) document the paleohydroclimatic history of the western Upper Colorado River headwater region. Multi-proxy analyses of sediment composition, mineralogy, and stable isotopes of carbonate (delta O-18 and delta C-13) show changes in effective moisture for the past ca. 10,000 years at millennial to decadal timescales. Emerald Lake originated as a shallow, closed-basin cirque pond during the Early Holocene. By ca. 7000 cal yr BP, higher lake levels and carbonate delta O-18 values indicate rising effective moisture and higher proportions of summer precipitation continued at least until ca. 5500 cal yr BP when a landslide entered the lake margin. Between ca. 4500 and 2400 cal yr BP dry conditions at Emerald Lake envelop the timing of the 'Late Holocene Dry Period' identified at lower elevations. For the past ca. 2500 years, Emerald Lake delta O-18 values were relatively low, indicating wetter conditions and higher snow input (compared to rain), except for dry periods at ca. 2000 cal yr BP and during the Medieval Climate Anomaly at ca. 1000 and ca. 500 cal yr BP. Results provide a long-term perspective on precipitation extremes that influence regional water supplies from a snow-dominated catchment typical of the predominant source region for the Upper Colorado River.

J	WAISER, MJ; ROBARTS, RD				WAISER, MJ; ROBARTS, RD			MICROBIAL NUTRIENT LIMITATION IN PRAIRIE SALINE LAKES WITH HIGH SULFATE CONCENTRATION	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Most of the lakes on the Canadian prairies are saline (> 3 g liter(-1) salt). Sulfate ions are relatively more abundant in these lakes than anywhere else in the world. Studies indicate that some of these lakes do not conform to empirical models which link chlorophyll a to spring total phosphorus concentration. A suite of tests, including nutrient enrichment bioassays, sestonic and protein to carbohydrate ratios, alkaline phosphatase activity, and P-32-turnover times were used to test microbial nutrient limitation in three prairie saline lakes. Although the concentration of soluble reactive P (SRP) was high (9-31 mu g liter(-1)) in two of the lakes, little was available for microbial growth. Bacteria were responsible for 84 and 53% of the P-32 uptake in these two lakes. Production of high levels of alkaline phosphatase by the phytoplankton in one lake appears to keep their intracellular stores of P replete and PN:PP ratios in the P-sufficient range. Striking differences were noted when our data from saline lakes were compared to data from freshwater lakes. Our saline lakes were P-deficient at SRP concentrations <31 mu g liter(-1), while freshwater lakes were P-deficient at SRP concentrations <1 mu g liter(-1). High concentrations of dissolved organic C, pH, and ionic composition in saline lakes appear to play a role in the availability of P.																			0024-3590					MAY	1995	40	3					566	574		10.4319/lo.1995.40.3.0566	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1995.40.3.0566													WOS:A1995RE86200013

The water transparency was measured in situ with the use of a Secchi disc in 31 sample points of the reservoir. The satellite images used for the temporal analysis of the water reflection were produced by the Landsat (Land Remote Sensing Satellite) 5 TM (Thematic Mapper). The image processing for the correction of atmospheric effects and the transformation of digital numbers into reflection values were done with the ENVI 5.0 software. The spacings of the transparency data and reflection values were done by the interpolation in the Spring 4.3.3 software. The reflection data in the space-temporal context indicates that the main alterations correspond to the tributary sectors of the Passo Real Reservoir. The spectral data of the Band 3 of the TM sensor were related with the water transparency variable in the 31 sample points. The models generated by linear regression showed that the water transparency have significant correlation with the reflection data in the red region.

J	Bargagli, R; Monaci, F; Bucci, C				Bargagli, Roberto; Monaci, Fabrizio; Bucci, Charlie			Environmental biogeochemistry of mercury in Antarctic ecosystems	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY												Polar regions are recognized as important sinks for long-range transport and deposition of Hg derived from natural and anthropogenic sources at lower latitudes. In previous studies we found enhanced Hg accumulation in soils, mosses and lichens from ice-free areas of Victoria Land facing the Terra Nova Bay coastal polynya. This study extends research to the distribution of organic C, total N, S, Hg, Al and Fe in surface soils, cyanobacterial mats and short sediment cores from four lacustrine ecosystems, each with different environmental characteristics and varying distances from the polynya. Results show that planktonic and benthic mats from lakes, along with mosses in the watershed, are the main sinks for Hg in summer meltwater. The C-normalized Hg concentrations in short sediment cores were higher in samples from lakes more exposed to marine aerosols from the coastal polynya. Reactive halogens in the aerosol promote the oxidation and deposition of atmospheric Hg in coastal ecosystems. The analysis of sediment cores did not reveal increasing Hg concentrations in recent sediments, except in the Lake 14 at Edmonson Point. The latter ice-free area is unaffected by the polynya and the increase in Hg concentrations in surface sediments could be due to local changes in lake water level and S biogeochemistry. Although change in sea ice coverage may enhance the role of Antarctic coastal ecosystems as sink in the global Hg cycle, our results seem to exclude possible risks for Antarctic terrestrial and freshwater organisms.

J	Nürnberg, GK; Shaw, M				Nürnberg, GK; Shaw, M			Productivity of clear and humic lakes: nutrients, phytoplankton, bacteria	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The relationships between long-term surface average concentrations of humic acids measured as water colour, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) or Secchi disk transparency and trophic state variables were studied with literature data from more than 600 freshwater lakes. The geometric means of summer surface average nutrient (phosphorus and nitrogen) concentration, phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll concentration), and hypolimnetic anoxia (anoxic factor) were significantly higher in coloured than in clear lakes. The regressions of colour or DOC on these trophic state variables were positive and significant throughout a range of three orders of magnitude. Phytoplankton or primary productivity was higher in coloured lakes, when expressed per volume of epilimnion. Annual integral primary productivity expressed on an areal basis was smaller in coloured lakes, probably a reflection of shallower phototrophic depths in these lakes. There is evidence that annual integral bacteria productivity is much higher in coloured lakes for two reasons: first, epilimnetic bacteria production was ca. four times higher in coloured lakes, second, other studies have shown that hypolimnetic bacteria production is commonly higher than epilimnetic production, especially in anoxic hypolimnia that are frequent in coloured lakes. All volumetrically expressed variables indicated higher productivity in coloured lakes. In addition, high bacteria productivity reflects a different food chain involving mixotrophs, possibly compensating for low light conditions. Our analyses indicate that primary and secondary productivity is as high as or higher than in clear lakes.					; Nurnberg, Gertrud/AFM-9725-2022	Nurnberg, Gertrud/0000-0003-1752-6562; 													0018-8158	1573-5117					1998	382						97	112		10.1023/A:1003445406964	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003445406964													WOS:000078947000008
J	Stringham, SF; Bryant, A				Stringham, Stephen F.; Bryant, Ann			Distance-dependent effectiveness of diversionary bear bait sites	HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS												We (Stringham and Bryant 2015) previously reported on Bryant's experiment in diversionary baiting of black bears (Ursus americanus). This occurred during the historically severe drought of 2007, in the Lake Tahoe Basin at the border of California and Nevada, USA. Effectiveness of baiting was inversely related to each community's distance from the bait site. That has provoked the question whether conflict rates during the period of baiting would have fallen anyway even without baiting. We show here that the general trend during both pre- and post-baiting years (2005-2006 and 2008-2009) was for an increase in conflicts during the same months that conflict rate declined during 2007. We also previously reported that, when data were pooled from all 20 communities, total conflicts in the year after baiting were lower than in the year before baiting; there was no backlash after baiting ended. The question has since arisen about whether pooling data across all communities hid backlash in those communities closest to a 2007 bait site - that post-baiting conflict rate was also inversely related to each community's distance from the nearest bait station. However, our regressions reveal no such relationship between distance versus total annual conflicts in each community during either or both of the 2 years post-baiting (2008-2009).																			1934-4392	1936-8046				SPR	2016	10	1					128	131																WOS:000376092600016

Ontogenetic patterns in prey use by pallid sturgeon in the Missouri River, South Dakota and Nebraska	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												P>The pallid sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus albus) is an endangered species native to the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. To date, recovery efforts have focused on stocking juvenile fish, but little is known about ontogenetic changes in diet composition. Although diet composition for pallid sturgeon is believed to change from macroinvertebrates to fish, it is unclear at what size and/or age these ontogenetic diet shifts occur. To evaluate diet composition, 29 hatchery-stocked pallid sturgeon (range 356-720 mm fork length [FL]; mean = 549; SE = 23) were collected from the Missouri River downstream of Fort Randall Dam, South Dakota and Nebraska during summer 2006. The majority of pallid sturgeon (72%) were captured within a large delta region formed by the Niobrara River in the headwaters of Lewis and Clark Lake. Predominant prey of pallid sturgeon based on percent occurrence was Ceratopogonidae (81%), Isonychiidae (67%), Chironomidae (52%), and fishes (24%). Percent composition by wet weight showed that diets were composed of fishes (68%), Ephemeroptera (23%), Decapoda (6%), and Diptera (3%). Graphical analysis of combined data showed that mayflies, particularly Isonychiidae, were an important component of pallid sturgeon diets. Nonetheless, the percent composition of fishes in the diet increased with pallid sturgeon body size; for fish > 600 mm FL (5-7 years of age) diets were composed primarily of fish prey (66%, mostly johnny darters Etheostoma nigrum). These findings highlight the importance of ontogenetic changes in diet composition for pallid sturgeon. Moreover, the unique habitat formed in the delta region is characterized by higher fish and invertebrate densities that may enhance foraging opportunities and thus improve recovery efforts for stocked pallid sturgeon.

Light attenuation rose significantly after liming. Short-term changes in light attenuation were attributed to increased scattering by suspended calcite particles; such changes persisted for fewer than 15 d due to the rapid dissolution of the calcite. Long-term increases in light attenuation corresponded to increases in light absorption, which were attributed to higher concentrations of light-absorbing substances (gelbstoff) as indicated by higher lake dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations. Changes in chlorophyll did not play an important role in regulating light attenuation except during the first summer following liming. Reacidification of one of the three limed lakes was accompanied by a decrease in lake DOC concentrations, followed by a gradual decrease in light attenuation and absorption. Within 3 yr after liming, the chemical and optical characteristics of this site were comparable with the pretreatment period. Results from lake liming experiments are consistent with the hypothesis that changes in the photochemical properties and/or the concentration of light-absorbing organic compounds are important mechanisms by which acidification alters the optical properties of lakes.					; Driscoll, Charles/F-9832-2014; Driscoll, Charles T./F-9832-2014	Bukaveckas, Paul/0000-0002-2636-7818; Driscoll, Charles T./0000-0003-2692-2890													0706-652X					JUN	1991	48	6					1030	1040		10.1139/f91-121	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f91-121													WOS:A1991FV22600010

Optical satellite imagery allows us to map this information within the entire lake area. The ESA Climate Change Initiative (ESA-CCI) estimates Chl-a concentrations, based on medium resolution satellite data, on a global scale. Chl-a concentrations provided by the ESA-CCI consortium were analyzed to assess their representativeness for water quality monitoring and subsequent phenology studies in Lake Geneva. Based on vertically resolved in-situ data, those datasets were evaluated through match-up comparisons. Because the underlying algorithms do not take into account the vertical distribution of phytoplankton, a specific analysis was performed to evaluate any potential biases in remote sensing estimation, and consequences for observed phenological trends. Different approaches to data averaging were performed to reconstruct Chl-a estimates provided by the remote sensing algorithms. Strong correlation (R-value > 0.89) and acceptable discrepancies (rmse similar to 1.4 mg.m(-3)) were observed for the ESA-CCI data. This approach permitted recalibration of the ESA CCI data for Lake Geneva. Finally, merging satellite and in-situ data provided a consistent time series for long term analysis of phytoplankton phenology and its interannual variability since 2002. This combination of in-situ and satellite data improved the temporal resolution of the time series, enabling a more accurate identification of the timing of specific spring events characterising phytoplankton phenology.					; Harmel, Tristan/I-1991-2012; Thackeray, Stephen/D-2415-2013; Harmel, Tristan/AAA-7939-2019; Soulignac, Frédéric/MZQ-7046-2025	Bonnier, Mona/0009-0006-5711-4916; Harmel, Tristan/0000-0002-1172-9636; Thackeray, Stephen/0000-0003-3274-2706; 													0380-1330					AUG	2024	50	4							102372	10.1016/j.jglr.2024.102372	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2024.102372		JUL 2024											WOS:001274638900001
J	Hoyal, DCJD; Bursik, MI; Atkinson, JF				Hoyal, DCJD; Bursik, MI; Atkinson, JF			Settling-driven convection: A mechanism of sedimentation from stratified fluids	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Convection driven by sediment particles may play an important role in sedimentation from the base of buoyant (hypopycnal) plumes, for example, fluvial plumes in stratified estuaries and lakes, black smokers on the ocean floor, volcanic clouds, and coastal currents. In addition to the well-known double-diffusive convection mechanism, another mode of convective instability development is by settling across the density interface, We performed laboratory experiments to investigate this fingering/convective instability mechanism and its effect on particle distribution in the water column and deposition at the bed. A simple theoretical model of finger formation at a fluid density interface is developed based on an analogy with thermal/plume formation at a flat heated plate, This model, which involves a thickening interface layer that becomes gravitationally unstable relative to the ambient fluid, is in good agreement with measurements of finger size and instability wavelength from visualization experiments. Since fingering at the density interface drives larger-scale convection in the fluid below, a mass balance model of the lower layer, assuming strong mixing (i.e., uniform sediment concentration) is successfully applied to predict sediment concentration in the water column and deposition at the bed. Strong mixing can be assumed since convective velocities are usually much greater than the particle fall velocities. As convection proceeds, the sediment concentrations in the two layers approach each other and convection will die out. Using the model equations, we develop analytical expressions for the time when convection ceases and the portion of sediment remaining in the water column.

Effect of stay-in-place metal forms on performance of concrete bridge decks	MANAGING AND MAINTAINING HIGHWAY STRUCTURES AND PAVEMENTS	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD				85th Annual Meeting of the Transportation-Research-Board	JAN 22-26, 2006	Washington, DC	Transportat Res Board				The primary objective of this research was to investigate the effect of stay-in-place metal forms (SIPMFs) on corrosion of steel reinforcement in concrete bridge decks. The study included 12 concrete bridge decks located within the Interstate 215 corridor in the vicinity of Salt Lake City, Utah. All decks were subject to similar traffic loading, climatic conditions, and maintenance treatments, including applications of deicing salts during winter months, and had been constructed during 1984-1989 with epoxy-coated rebar. Test methods included visual inspection, chain dragging, hammer sounding, Schmidt hammer testing, half-cell potential testing, and chloride-concentration testing. An analysis of covariance (ANOCOVA) was performed to evaluate the effect of SIPMFs on each of the 13 deck properties measured. Five of the 13 analyses yielded significant results, including age, cover, Schmidt rebound number, half-cell potential, and chloride concentration at 2-in. depth. While differences in age and cover resulted from limitations associated with the deck selection process and were accounted for in the ANOCOVA, the differences in Schmidt rebound number, half-cell potential, and chloride concentration were attributed to elevated moisture contents in decks with SIPMFs. While higher moisture contents lead to enhanced curing conditions that ultimately provide higher concrete strengths, they also facilitate greater ionic current flow necessary to sustain higher reinforcement corrosion rates and cause accelerated diffusion of chlorides into the concrete. Given these findings, SIPMFs should be used with caution in concrete bridge deck construction.

Flood irrigation and excess fertilization with manure affect both the hydrology and the chemical quality of surface and groundwater, resulting in diffuse nitrogen pollution. However, studies analyzing the mechanisms linking agricultural practices with vertical and horizontal nitrogen paths are scarce in this area. We investigated groundwater quality and quantity in an unconfined, coarse-grained alluvial aquifer adjacent to the Mincio River (a tributary of the Po River), where steep summer gradients of nitrate (NO3-) concentrations are reported. The effects of manure on solutes' vertical transport during precipitation events in fertilized and in control soils were simulated under laboratory conditions. The results show high SiO(2)and NO(3)(-)leaching in fertilized soils. Similarly, field data are characterized by high SiO(2)and NO(3)(-)concentrations, with a comparable spatial distribution but a different temporal evolution, suggesting their common origin but different processes affecting their concentrations in the study area. Our results show that SiO(2)can be used as a conservative tracer of manure spreading, as it does not undergo biogeochemical processes that significantly alter its concentrations. On the contrary, nitrate displays large short-term variations related to aquifer recharge (i.e., flood irrigation and precipitation). In fact, aquifer recharge may promote immediate solubilization and stimulate nitrification, resulting in high NO(3)(-)concentrations up to 95.9 mg/L, exceeding the Water Framework Directive (WFD) thresholds. When recharge ends, anoxic conditions likely establish in the saturated zone, favoring denitrification and resulting in a steep decrease in NO(3)(-)concentrations.

In agricultural lands prone to prolonged flooding during spring snowmelt, P may be released to overlying floodwater and transported to lakes downstream. Ferric chloride (FeCl3) is a potential soil amendment to mitigate P losses, but its effectiveness for flooded soils with snowmelt is not well documented. Thirty-six intact soil monoliths taken from four agricultural fields in Manitoba's Red River Valley region were surface-amended with FeCl3 at three rates (0, 2.5, and 5 Mg ha(-1)) to evaluate the effectiveness of FeCl3 in minimizing P losses to porewater and floodwater. Over 8 weeks of simulated snowmelt flooding, porewater, and floodwater samples taken weekly were analyzed for concentrations of dissolved reactive P (DRP), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), and pH. Change in the redox potential was also measured weekly. With time of flooding, redox potential decreased in all soil monoliths. At early stages of flooding, the porewater pH values were significantly lower in FeCl3-amended monoliths but increased with flooding time. Porewater and floodwater DRP concentrations increased in all soils when flooded, but the magnitudes varied. Amendment of FeCl3 decreased the DRP concentrations from 17% to 97% in porewater and 26% to 99% in floodwater, with the effectiveness varying depending on the soil, FeCl3 rate, and flooding time. Amendment of FeCl3 increased porewater concentrations of Ca, Mg, Fe, and Mn. Soil amendment with FeCl3 at both rates shows promise in mitigating redox-induced P losses from flooded soils.

Here we present a new complete glacier record from Austre Okstindbreen in Nordland, northern Norway. This reconstruction is based on a number of short and long cores retrieved from several downstream basins, which have been analyzed by a suite of methods including geochemical elements (XRF), rock magnetic properties, dry bulk density (DBD) and Loss-on-ignition (LOI). Lake sediment distribution was surveyed and mapped prior to coring by the use of ground penetrating radar (GPR). Independently lichen-dated marginal moraines and historical information about the glacier frontal positions from old photographs and maps have made it possible to link the moraine sequence to the Pb-210 dated lake sediment chronology. This integrated approach reveals that Austre Okstindbreen is the first known glacier in Scandinavia to possibly have survived the "Holocene Thermal Optimum". It also brackets the four largest glacier advances to c 7400-7000, 1400-1200, 900-700 and 300-150 years before AD 2000 (b2k). In contrast to most reconstructed glaciers in Scandinavia, the largest glacier advance was not associated with the "Little Ice Age", but rather to an earlier period centred at 1300 b2k. Both the moraine chronology and the lacustrine records document this Neoglacial advance. Compared to other glacier reconstructions from the Northern Hemisphere, we identify near-synchronous glacier advances occurring roughly at 4000 b2k; 2700 b2k; 1300 b2k and during the "Little Ice Age". These correlative advances across the Northern Hemisphere suggest that these observed centennial-scale events are a shared feature regardless of the large geographical distances separating them. Some minor discrepancies between different geographical areas may be caused by lack of precise dating, but local climatic conditions may play a role as well. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

J	RASPOPOV, IM				RASPOPOV, IM			VEGETATION OF LARGE SHALLOW LAKES OF THE NORTHWEST OF THE USSR AND ITS PRODUCTION	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Large shallow lakes situated in Arkhangelsk and Vologda provinces of the USSR are overgrown with macrophytes to different extents. Myriophyllum spicatum L. and M. alterniflorum D.C. dominate in the vegetation cover of Lake Lacha (.hivin.S = 345 km2; .hivin.z = 1.6 m) overgrown by 48%. Lake Vozhe (.hivin.S = 418 km2; .hivin.z = 1.4 m) is overgrown by 18%. The major area of the lake covered by macrophytes falls on the groups of Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin, ex Steud. and Potamogeton lucens L. Lake Kubenskoye (.hivin.S = 400 km2; .hivin.z = 2.5 m) is overgrown by 30%, very sparse associations of P. lucens and dense thickets of Polygonum amphibium L. predominate. The associations of Carex acuta L. and C. nigra (L.) Recihard occupy large areas in stream deltas. The overgrowing area of Lake Beloye (.hivin.S = 1284 km2; .hivin.z = 4.1 m) accounts for about 1%, associations of P. australis predominating. Annual production of macrophytes in the lakes accounts correspondingly for 60, 35, 14.5 and 2.8 g C/m2 of water body area. Lakes Lacha and Vozhe are considered more productive in comparison with lakes Kubenskoye and Beloye (more southernly situated), as explained by morphometrical peculiarities of these lakes.																			0003-9136						1979	86	2					242	253																WOS:A1979HK30300008

Here we analyze the erosional response of landscapes on the Tibetan Plateau to interglacial climate forcing. Using the theory of dynamical systems on Holocene time series of geochemical proxies, we derive a sedimentary response model that accurately simulates observed proxy variation in three lake records. The model suggests that millennial variations in sediment composition reflect a self-organization of landscapes in response to abrupt climate change between 11.6 and 11.9 ka BP. The self-organization is characterized by oscillations in sediment supply emerging from a feedback between physical and chemical erosion processes, with estimated response times between 3,000 to 18,000 years depending on catchment topography. The implications of our findings emphasize the need for landscape response models to decipher the paleoclimatic code in continental sediment records. Plain Language Summary Lake sediments are an important source of information on past climates. Reading the information is not always straightforward. Complex interactions in landscapes can affect the transmission of climatic signals to the sediment record. However, the exact nature of such complex interactions remains unknown. This study compares sediment deposits of three lakes on the Tibetan Plateau. The deposits are continuous records of landscape responses to climate change during the last 12,000 years. We identified a mathematical model that accurately simulates changes in sediment composition at all sites. The model simulations suggest that an abrupt warming at the end of the last glacial period destabilized the landscapes. This caused fluctuations in the transport of sediments, which persisted for several thousand years. Our findings present evidence for a long-lasting impact of abrupt climate change on fundamental Earth surface processes.

J	AQRAWI, AAM; EVANS, G				AQRAWI, AAM; EVANS, G			SEDIMENTATION IN THE LAKES AND MARSHES (AHWAR) OF THE TIGRIS-EUPHRATES DELTA, SOUTHERN MESOPOTAMIA	SEDIMENTOLOGY												The fluvial plains of lower Mesopotamia crossed by the Tigris and Euphrates rivers are occupied by fresh-brackish water lakes and extensive reed-marshes dominated by Phragmites sp. and Typha sp. (together locally called Ahwar). Allochthonous sediment is mostly supplied by the Tigris and Euphrates seasonal floodwaters, and by winds which bring aeolian dust from the north-west and sand during storms from the western deserts in summer. Other contributions to the sediment budget are made by in situ biological activity and by biochemical-chemical processes within the sediments. The sediments are dominantly silts, with silt comprising more than 60% of the sediment. The remainder of the sediment consists of varying quantities of clay and sand. Clay is more abundant in the lower parts of most of the analysed cores (30-80 cm in length), indicating a change in sediment supply and/or sedimentary environment. Well developed stratification is found only on the river levees and in some clay-rich lake and marsh sediments. The remainder of the sediments are generally poorly stratified with irregular stratification and considerable bioturbation. Mineralogically, the sediments consist mainly of calcite, quartz, dolomite and feldspar (particularly albite). Aragonite is present as a result of in situ production by macrofauna. The clay fraction (<2 mu m) consists of smectite, illite-smectite, illite, palygorskite, kaolinite and chlorite. The total organic carbon (TOC) content is usually <5% except for some peaty surface layers of the freshwater lakes and marshes where TOC may rise to 10-20%. The sediments have a relatively high calcium carbonate content, 20-80%, the highest values only being found in mollusc-rich horizons. The sediments contain high amounts of Ca, Mg and Sr and are generally low in Al, Ti, K and V. Values for Fe, Co, Pb, Zn and Mn are close to the average for mudstones, whereas Cu and P are relatively low. The high Ni and Cr contents of the sediments are related to high contents in the source material of the major rivers and aeolian deposits. Multivariate statistical analysis shows that elemental components of surface and source materials correlate well with other sedimentary properties. Aragonitic molluscs of various species dominate the macrofauna, but a microfauna of foraminifers, ostracods and diatoms is also present in the sediments.																			0037-0746					AUG	1994	41	4					755	776		10.1111/j.1365-3091.1994.tb01422.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3091.1994.tb01422.x													WOS:A1994PD84900008
J	Birks, HH; Birks, HJB				Birks, Hilary H.; Birks, H. John B.			Vegetation responses to late-glacial climate changes in western Norway	PRESLIA												How fast can vegetation respond to rapid climate change? To answer this question, we require long-term vegetational data and an independent climate record. Both can be obtained from multi-proxy palaeoecological studies involving pollen analysis and plant macrofossil analysis (vegetational data) and chironomid analysis (climate record). Late-glacial climate changed rapidly and passed critical vegetation thresholds in western Norway. The interstadial (Allerod) vegetation at Krakenes on the west coast was analogous to low- or mid-alpine vegetation in the west Norwegian mountains today. There was a marked vegetational response over similar to 10 years to the Younger Dryas cooling, even though mean July air temperature, as inferred from the independent fossil chironomid record, only decreased by about 2 degrees C. Together with the prevailing precipitation, this was sufficient to allow a cirque glacier to develop above Krakenes Lake during the Younger Dryas. As summer temperatures increased rapidly at the opening of the Holocene, plants responded immediately. Warmth-intolerant arctic-alpines rapidly succumbed. Warmth-tolerant arctic-alpine species expanded until declining as a result of increasing competition. Successional processes proceeded through to damp and dry grassland, the development of tall-fern vegetation, and the expansion of Empetrum-dominated dwarf-shrub heath. Tree-birch Betula pubescens showed a migrational lag of similar to 500 years before forming birch woodland. This study illustrates how floristic and vegetational patterns recorded in sedimentary sequences can be interpreted in terms of ecological processes if an independent palaeoclimate record is available; here, from fossil chironomid assemblages from the same sediment core.

J	Priscu, JC; Downes, MT; McKay, CP				Priscu, JC; Downes, MT; McKay, CP			Extreme supersaturation of nitrous oxide in a poorly ventilated Antarctic lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Lake Bonney, a permanently ice-covered Antarctic lake, has a middepth maximum N2O concentration of 41.6 mu M N (>580,000% saturation with respect to the global average mixing ratio of N2O) in its east lobe, representing the highest level vet reported for a natural aquatic system. Atmospheric N2O over the lake was 45% above the global average, indicating that this lake is an atmospheric source of N2O. Apparent N2O production (ANP) was correlated with apparent oxygen utilization (AOU), and denitrification was not detectable, implying that nitrification is the primary source for this gas. The slope of a regression of ANP on AOU revealed that potential N2O production per unit of potential O-2 consumed in the east lobe of Lake Bonney is at least two orders of magnitude greater than reported for the ocean. The maximum yield ratio for N2O [ANP/(NO2- + NO3-)] in Lake Bonney is 26% (i.e. 1 atom of N appears in N2O for every 3.9 atoms appearing in oxidized N), which exceeds previous reports for pelagic systems, being similar to values from reduced sediments. Areal N2O flux from the lake to the atmosphere is >200 times the areal flux reported for oceanic systems; most of this gas apparently enters the atmosphere through a small moat that occupies similar to 3% of the surface of the lake and exists for similar to 10 weeks in summer.

Egg retention of high-latitude sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) in the Pilgrim River, Alaska, during the Pacific marine heatwave of 2014-2016	POLAR BIOLOGY												Ocean and freshwater conditions can influence spawning success of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) by governing the energy content of fish at the start of and during the spawning migration. Ocean conditions determine the energy stores of fish at the freshwater entry, while freshwater conditions determine how quickly stored energy is depleted as individuals migrate to spawning grounds in natal rivers and lakes. We assessed the occurrence of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) egg retention (failure to deposit eggs) in a high-latitude (similar to 65 degrees N) watershed that has a large, inter-annual variation in the number of returning adults. We also explored relationships between ocean and freshwater conditions with egg retention of female sockeye salmon. The proportion of females with egg retention (> 50 eggs) varied by threefold (12 to 36%) across years (2013 to 2020) and was related to ocean conditions represented by the North Pacific Index (NPI). Egg retention was more common in years with low NPI values (a stronger Aleutian Low) in association with the Pacific marine heatwave of 2014-2016 that disrupted food webs. This initial study contains the first empirical data observing the influence of ocean conditions on egg retention for any Pacific salmon population. The lack of any relationship between egg retention and freshwater temperatures was consistent with water temperatures primarily occurring below thresholds associated with heat stress related mortality (< 18 degrees C). Understanding the amount of egg retention and how environmental drivers influence egg retention within Pacific salmon populations provides insights for managers assessing the number of successful spawners and helps refine escapement-based management efforts.					; Carey, Michael/G-9516-2012	von Biela, Vanessa/0000-0002-7139-5981; Carey, Michael/0000-0002-3327-8995; 													0722-4060	1432-2056				AUG	2021	44	8					1643	1654		10.1007/s00300-021-02902-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00300-021-02902-8		JUN 2021											WOS:000663234200001
J	LAROW, EJ				LAROW, EJ			POPULATION INTERACTION - SYNCHRONIZER FOR PERSISTENT RHYTHMICITY OF CHAOBORUS LARVAE	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Fifty chaoborid larvae (Diptera: Chaoboridae) were maintained singly in 200 ml. experimental chambers with lake water and sediments. The larvae entrained in a reversed light-dark cycle (L D 12: 12) were monitored at 2-h intervals to observe whether or not larvae were in the planktonic state. Under constant conditions individual larvae seemed to vary in the time of movement out of the sediments and subsequent time spent in the planktonic state. A significant difference was observed when the individual activity patterns (i.e., the number of times an individual was observed to be planktonic during the 12 h observation period) were summated and compared with previously published population data (LaRow 1968). When larvae whose individual activity patterns were recorded were pooled in a single experimental chamber the activity pattern observed was identical to that previously reported. The persistent, diurnal rhythm observed in Chaoborus is most likely a population rhythm and the interaction of the individuals within the population aids in synchronization of the rhythm. Larvae maintained singly in experimental chambers enabled the actual percentage of the benthic population that leave the sediments and become planktonic each night to be determined. During the summer months at least 82.8% of the 4th instar larvae leave the sediments and enter the water column.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1976	48	1					85	88		10.1007/BF00033494	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00033494													WOS:A1976BE51000011

Short-term effects of a buffered alum treatment on Green Lake sediment phosphorus speciation	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Green Lake, Washington, was treated with a dose of 24 mg Al/L aluminum sulfate (alum) and sodium aluminate during March-April 2004 to reduce dissolved phosphorus concentrations to ameliorate a variety of eutrophication-related problems. Four sediment cores collected six months after the alum treatment in Green Lake were used to examine the short-term effects of alum on sediment phosphorus speciation. Peaks in aluminum bound phosphorus (Al-P) and total aluminum (Tot-Al) were observed in three of the four cores analyzed, resulting in an average ratio of added Al to Al-P formed (Al:Al-P) of 112:1. By comparing this ratio to the average ratio of similar to 11:1 found in other alum-treated Washington lakes, it can be inferred that approximately 10% of the binding capacity of the added Al had been utilized. Assuming a final ratio of Al:Al-P of 11:1, the added Al has the potential capacity to bind a total of 21.6 g/m(2) of P. The amount of sediment inorganic P that supports internal loading (Fe-P and labile-P) in the fall of 2004 was determined to be 2.8 g/m(2). Thus the quantity of alum added to Green Lake should be sufficient to inactivate the remaining inorganic mobile-P and to control future P mobilization from the pool of organic sediment P.

Fibre optic distributed temperature sensing (FO-DTS) has been successfully used to locate groundwater discharge into lakes and rivers at the sediment-water interface, but locating groundwater discharge would be easier if it could be detected from the more accessible water surface. So far, it is not clear if how and under which conditions the LGD signal propagates through the water column to the water surface-atmosphere interface, and what perturbations and signal losses occur along this pathway. In the present study, LGD was simulated in a mesocosm experiment. Under winter conditions, water with temperatures of 14 to 16 degrees C was discharged at the bottom of a 10x2.8-m mesocosm. Water within this mesocosm ranged from 4.0 to 7.4 degrees C. Four layers (20, 40, 60, and 80cm above the sediment) of the 82cm deep mesocosm were equipped with FO-DTS for tracing thermal patterns in the mesocosm. Aims are (a) to test whether the positive buoyancy of relatively warm groundwater imported by LGD into shallow water bodies allows detection of LGD at the lake's water surface-atmosphere interface by FO-DTS, (b) to analyse the propagation of the temperature signal from the sediment-water interface through the water column, and (c) to learn more about detectability of the signal under different discharge rates and weather conditions. The experiments supported the benchmarking of scale dependencies and robustness of FO-DTS applications for measuring upwelling into aquatic environments and revealed that weather conditions can have important impacts on the detection of upwelling at water surface-atmosphere interfaces at larger scales.					; Gomez-Velez, Jesus/AAU-6054-2020; Lewandowski, Jorg/E-9028-2012; Krause, Stefan/C-4351-2008; Hannah, David/B-9221-2015; Lewandowski, Jörg/E-9028-2012	Krause, Stefan/0000-0003-2521-2248; Lewandowski, Jorg/0000-0001-5278-129X; Hannah, David/0000-0003-1714-1240; Gomez-Velez, Jesus/0000-0001-8045-5926													0885-6087	1099-1085				JAN 15	2018	32	2					185	199		10.1002/hyp.11403	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.11403													WOS:000422753200002

Size and Retention of Breeding Territories of Yellow-billed Loons (Gavia adamsii) in Alaska and Canada	WATERBIRDS												Yellow-billed Loons (Gavia adamsii) breed in lakes in the treeless Arctic and are globally rare. Like their sister taxa, the well-documented Common Loon (G. immer) of the boreal forest, Yellow-billed Loons exhibit strong territorial behavior during the breeding season. Little is known about what size territories are required, however, or how readily territories are retained from year to year. An understanding of territory dynamics and size is needed by management agencies as most of the U.S. breeding population of Yellow-billed Loons resides in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska where oil and gas development is expected to increase in the next few decades. Using locational data from a set of Yellow-billed Loons marked with satellite transmitters, we quantified an index of territory radius for each of three breeding populations: two in Alaska and one in Canada. The mean territory radius was 0.42 km for Yellow-billed Loons summering on lakes within the Seward Peninsula in northwest Alaska, 0.69 km for Yellow-billed Loons within the Arctic Coastal Plain of Alaska (encompasses the National Petroleum Reserve), and 0.96 km for Yellow-billed Loons within Daring Lake in mainland Canada. In this study, the mean territory radius on the Arctic Coastal Plain was about half the distance identified in stipulations for industrial development in the National Petroleum Reserve. The range in territory size among areas corresponded to a gradient in size of lakes used by Yellow-billed Loons with territories at the two Alaska sites on lakes averaging < 200 ha while territories in Canada were generally on much larger lakes. In the year after capture, 71% of Yellow-billed Loons retained territories that were held the previous year. Most Yellow-billed Loons that lost their territories wandered over a large area within 6 km of their prior territory. No Yellow-billed Loons occupied new territories, though one reacquired its prior territory after a 1-year hiatus. Retention of a territory in a subsequent year was positively related to early arrival dates at the breeding site. For Yellow-billed Loons on the Arctic Coastal Plain, this relationship was quite strong with a week lag in arrival decreasing the probability of retaining a territory by 80%. These collective observations, in combination with theoretical studies of population regulation by floaters (non-territorial birds), suggest that lake habitat suitable for breeding Yellow-billed Loons may currently limit population size in this species.

Sea-salt in the precipitation has the same elemental ratios as in seawater and its concentration decreases with distance from the shore. The sampling station at Mjoanes, at Thingvallavatn Lake, is located around 100 km west of Eyjafjallajokull and during and after its eruption in 2010, the concentration of fluoride in precipitation increased from 10-20 mu g/l to 90 mu g/l and the annual average concentration elevated from 11 mu g/l to 28 mu g/l. From 1980 to 1998, pH of rainwater at Irafoss increased due to emissions reductions of anthropogenic sulphur. Since 1998, pH of the precipitation has decreased again at Irafoss. Similar pH changes are seen in Mjeanes, which is close to Irafoss, but not in other sampling stations further away. River water samples collected in the vicinity of the rainwater samplers, from the spring fed river Sog have elevated non-SO4 sulphur concentration from 2005-2010 and decreased 6345 from 2005-2007. Irafoss and Mj6anes are located approximately 12-20 km away from two geothermal power plants, Nesjavellir- and Hellisheidi power plants that emit large quantities of CO2 and H2S, among other gases, to the atmosphere. The data presented here suggest that geothermal power production can cause local environmental effects, like rainwater acidification and increases in dissolved sulphur in rivers in the vicinity of the power plants.																			1878-5220						2014	10						358	364		10.1016/j.proeps.2014.08.058	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.proeps.2014.08.058													WOS:000345407200063

First occurrence of charophyte algae from a Triassic Paleolake in Argentina and their paleoenvironmental context	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												This paper presents the first record of charophytes from the Triassic sedimentary rocks of Argentina and the entire southern hemisphere. Algal remains were found in the Cerro Puntudo Formation dated as Anisian (243.8 +/- 1.9 Ma). The formation is part of the Cuyana Basin, which formed as consequence of the Triassic rifting of Pangaea. The paleoenvironments represented by this succession include from bottom to top: (1) a proximal to medial alluvial fan system: (2) a distal alluvial fan deposit: (3) a braided fluvial system with. small channelized bodies: (4) a distal fluvial system containing rare carbonates: and (5) a carbonate-rich lacustrine system. The lacustrine fades association corresponds mainly to carbonate microbialites with three recognized facies, namely disrupted micritic limestones (Lmd), stromatolitic limestones (Ls), and oncolitic limestones (Lo). The Lo facies is rich in oncolites formed by filamentous algae in the cortex and charophyte remains (gyrogonites) in the nucleus and is interpreted as being deposited in a carbonate-rich pond environment, perhaps sourced from springs. Filamentous algae are thought to cause the precipitation of carbonates and trigger the development of micritic coatings in the ponds. Sedimentary and paleobiologic evidence suggest minor movement of the oncolites in a ponded environment where charophytes developed. The charophyte remains found in the Cerro Puntudo Formation are gyrogonites attributed to the Porocharaceae family. All the previous records for Triassic Charophyta correspond to Laurasia in the northern hemisphere, therefore, the paleolatitudinal location of this finding allows the expansion of the paleobiogeographic distribution of the group into Gondwana.

This sequence records an overall evolution from deep marine environment to shallow lake associated with braided river, braided river delta and meandering river delta. Core description, well log interpretation, and stable isotope analysis, including carbon, oxygen and strontium, were conducted to understand the sedimentary evolution of Shan 2 to He 8 Member. The Shanxi Formation, which consists of the Shan 2 and Shan 1 members, is characterized by a tidal-influenced meandering river delta environment and a higher C-13 value and Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio and a lower O-18 value. The He 8 Member, the basal part of the Xiashihezi Formation, is featured by a braided river to braided river delta system and a lower C-13 value, Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio, and a higher O-18 value. Four third-order depositional sequences separated by five sequence boundaries are determined. Coarsening upward sequences of the Shan 2 Member-He 8 Member indicate a general regression trend, which can be correlated to global sea-level fall occurring during the Roadian-Wuchiapingian, as also evidenced by previous published zircon U-Pb results. The coal-bearing sequence (Shanxi Formation) to non-coal-bearing sequence (He 8 Member), as well as a decrease of Sr-87/Sr-86, suggest a trend from humid to arid climates. A combined effect of sea-level drop and a small uplift at the end of Shanxi Formation are proposed.					jin, lina/KRO-4922-2024; Clift, Peter/JWO-3915-2024; Shan, Xin/AAG-8915-2020														1000-9515	1755-6724				FEB	2018	92	1					268	285		10.1111/1755-6724.13505	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1755-6724.13505													WOS:000426255200019
J	Sabbatini, MR; Murphy, KJ; Irigoyen, JH				Sabbatini, MR; Murphy, KJ; Irigoyen, JH			Vegetation-environment relationships in irrigation channel systems of southern Argentina	AQUATIC BOTANY												Using a multivariate approach, relationships were determined between functionally defined groups of aquatic plants and the disturbance and stress pressures associated with ambient conditions and management regime in artificial channel systems of two irrigation districts located in the lower valleys of the Rio Colorado and Rio Negro, Argentina. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) of 1993-1994 survey data showed that the distribution and abundance of aquatic vegetation was closely related to water conductivity, winter drought, water depth, water movement and management regime. Indices of disturbance and stress were constructed fr om combined environmental data for each site. CCA showed that each variable (disturbance or stress) explained about half of the constrained variation. Four functional plant groups were identified using cluster analyses, occurring in different sets of disturbance and stress conditions. Two groups (including Charophyta, Potamogeton pectinatus and Potamogeton pusillus) were well adapted to disturbance tolerance, especially from weed control procedures, bur vulnerable to higher saline-stress pressures. Ruppia maritima, Zannichellia palustris and filamentous algae characterised a third group found in shallow, high-salinity, permanently filled channels. All plants of the fourth group (Potamogeton illinoensis, Elodea callitrichoides, Ceratophyllum demersum, Myriophyllum aquaticum and the floating Azolla filiculoides) are competitive species, which occurred in channels with low environmental stress conditions (low water conductivity and high light availability), but with component species differing in their tolerance of disturbance.

This work represents results from the monitoring of the reservoirs Aleksandur Stamboliyski, Antimovo, Batak, Burzina, Gorni Dubnik, Zhrebchevo, Iovkovtsi, Krapets, Mandra, Ognyanovo, Rabisha, Suedinenie, Tsonevo and the lakes Alepu, Atanasovsko Ezero, Dourankoulak, Pomoriysko Ezero, Shabla and Sreburna. The studies were conducted simultaneously in the summer months of 2011 and 2012 on the following parameters: algal taxonomic composition and abundance, presence/absence of algal blooms and blooms of potential toxic species, algal group index, reference index for macrophytes, water temperature, transparency, pH, conductivity, chlorophyll a, total phosphorus, total nitrogen, phosphate phosphorus, ammonium nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand. The ecological status was registered in the five WFD categories. The set of data, based on the detected species composition of 236 algal taxa and 33 species of macrophytes, allowed us to compare statistically the values of the used parameters and the water bodies according to their biodiversity and abiotic features. The obtained results are important for clarifying the official classification of the surface water bodies of Bulgaria according to State Order N4/14.09.2012 and for making proposals for its improvement. Comparisons of the finally attributed ecological status/potential, based on macrophytes and phytoplankton, showed some significant differences and were used as a basis for discussion of the parameters and their weighted values, used up-to-now for the assessment of Bulgarian water bodies.					; Traykov, Ivan/S-6569-2019; Zidarova, Ralitsa/I-3793-2017; Uzunov, Blagoy/AAK-9021-2021; Tosheva, Anita/AAL-1679-2021; Stoyneva-Gärtner, Maya/F-4549-2018	Traykov, Ivan/0000-0003-0832-6868; Stoyneva-Gartner, Maya/0000-0003-2439-3737; Zidarova, Ralitsa/0000-0002-6451-0099; Uzunov, Blagoy/0000-0002-2285-8935; 													1310-2818	1314-3530				JUL 29	2015	29			1	SI		S33	S38		10.1080/13102818.2015.1047200	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13102818.2015.1047200													WOS:000357189300005

These SPEs can generate hurricane-scale precipitation, creating a variety of natural hazards such as floods and landslides. For California, the most complete SPE-flood record yet generated is a 9000-year paleoflood reconstruction from the Santa Barbara Basin (Du et al. in Mar Geol 397:29-42, 2018). Finding terrestrial counterparts to compare to the Santa Barbara Basin is a challenge in Southern California where lake basins are rare and the terrestrial spatiotemporal signature of SPE floods remains largely unconstrained. Here, we present five 1-2 m sediment cores from a sag pond along the San Andreas Fault in the southern Carrizo Plain. The most complete record (core CLPC21-4) was selected for a variety of chronological, sedimentological, and biological analyses. Principal Component Analysis on these data reveals two end member sediment unit types: event versus ambient sedimentation. We focus on the two thickest sediment units likely generated by SPEs. These two units (EU 1 and EU 2) are especially distinct within CLPC21-4, characterized by erosive bases, above average sand content, normal grading, low magnetic susceptibility, and low total organic matter. Moreover, they are visually apparent across all five cores within the sag pond and thin from source to sink. Age control for the two units is constrained by AMS 14C dates on discrete organic materials and supported by the identification of Erodium's first appearance ca. 1750-1765 CE in the Santa Barbara region. Using these age constraints, we infer the maximum limiting age range for Event Unit 1 from 1470 to 1640 CE and Event Unit 2 from 1740 to 1800 CE. Within the limits of dating, site-specific proxy sensitivities, and inherent meteorological heterogeneity, we propose a probable correlation to Santa Barbara Basin flood events at 1525 CE and 1760 CE. Our results suggest that sag ponds may represent a viable and untapped paleoclimatic archive for California. Future work will focus on a latitudinal series of sag ponds to determine the spatiotemporal sequence and correlativity of SPEs in the sediment record.

J	Changnon, SA; Kunkel, KE				Changnon, SA; Kunkel, KE			Record flood-producing rainstorms of 17-18 July 1996 in the Chicago metropolitan area. Part I: Synoptic and mesoscale features	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY												A unique rainstorm in northern Illinois produced 43 cm of precipitation in mid-July 1996, the highest 24-h precipitation amount ever recorded officially in the upper Midwest. Rains exceeding 20 cm fell over an area of 4400 km(2), creating extremely damaging flash floods in portions of Chicago and its suburbs. Measurements from 496 rain gauges, including 80 recording gauges in the heavy rain area, made it possible to accurately define this storm. The heavy rains were the result of two massive mesoscale convective systems, one in the afternoon and one at night. These systems formed to the north of a nearby stationary warm front. Several factors contributed to the excessive rainfall. Excessive moisture was present to the southwest of the warm front over Iowa and western Illinois; atmospheric moisture content was enhanced by surface evaporation from a very wet surface created by heavy rains the previous day, creating a conditionally unstable atmosphere. A cool air mass transported by easterly winds off Lake Michigan strengthened and slowed the movement of the warm front. A low-level jet oriented perpendicular to the warm front resulted in rising motion north of the warm front. These factors (instability, moisture availability, lifting mechanism) combined to form intense storms. This paper, the first of a three-part series, describes the storm in detail, including its morphology and causes? and the resulting rainfall distributions.

J	BORGMANN, U; WHITTLE, DM				BORGMANN, U; WHITTLE, DM			PARTICLE-SIZE-CONVERSION EFFICIENCY, INVERTEBRATE PRODUCTION, AND POTENTIAL FISH PRODUCTION IN LAKE-ONTARIO	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												The relationships between body size and p,p'-DDE and total PCB concentration in zooplankton, mysids, amphipods, slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus), rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax), alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), and lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) in Lake Ontario were determined for samples collected from 1989 to 1992. Amphipods, and to a lesser extent sculpins, had higher DDE and PCB concentrations than predicted from the contaminant concentration - body size relationship for the pelagic species. PCB, but not DDE, concentrations in zooplankton were also abnormally high. For the pelagic species, excluding PCB concentrations in zooplankton, the log contaminant concentration - log body size relationship had a slope of 0.23 (95% confidence limits = +/-0.014). Combined with revised estimates of the efficiency of contaminant retention from one body size to another (epsilon' = 0.05-0.10), the revised estimate of particle-size-conversion efficiency (epsilon) for Lake Ontario falls between 0.27 and 0.35. Recent estimates of invertebrate (zooplankton, mysid, and amphipod) annual production average 18 g/m2 (dry weight) with upper and lower limit estimates of 14-27 g/m2. Using epsilon to extrapolate from invertebrate to fish production results in estimates of mean potential fish production in Lake Ontario of 1-7 kg/ha (wet weight), as compared with previously published estimates of 6 and 14 kg/ha.																			0706-652X					MAR	1994	51	3					693	700		10.1139/f94-069	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f94-069													WOS:A1994NN39000019

Bailey subsect. Lupulinae (Tuckerman) Kuk.; C. acaulis Urv. formerly placed in sect. Spirostachyae (Drejer) L. Bailey; C. subantarctica Speg., previously unplaced, and a new species, C. pisanoi. Section Abditispicae is distinguished from all others by: culms solitary or few together from long-creeping rhizomes; basal sheaths brown; bract and leaf margins with irregularly-spaced, unbranched and 2(4)-branched, short, stiff hairs; spikes 1-5, the lateral ones (when present) borne at or near the plant base and largely hidden among leaves or slightly exerted on more or less erect peduncles; perigynia subcoriaceous or coriaceus, more or less papillose, 9-15-veined, plano-convex to biconvex or suborbicular in cross section; perigynium beak essentially lacking teeth, or, if toothed, the teeth weak and scarious; staminal filaments sometimes connate (stamens monadelphous), then the anthers in groups of 2''s or 3''s; stigmas 2. The section appears to be endemic to southern South America, occurring in Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego, with isolated populations also known from west-central Argentina and the Falkland Islands. Habitats are moist to wet grasslands, swales, spring seepages, "bogs" and swamps, mossy vega, lake shores, and wet sands and gravels by the sea.																			0363-6445	1548-2324				OCT-DEC	1987	12	4					572	585		10.2307/2418892	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2418892													WOS:A1987L443600011

We analysed geomorphological landform change, sedimentological and geochronological data, pollen, and plant macrofossils of a 16-m-long sediment core from the Eichholz Maar (EHM). The EHM erupted between approximate to 20 and 15ka ago (MIS 2). Lacustrine siliclastic infilling was completed about 7500 years ago. Lateglacial rates of sedimentation are generally 2 to 5 times higher than in other maar lakes of the WEVF. Local factors, therefore, overprint the relative efficacy of the climate-controlled variance of sedimentation rates at the Lateglacial/Holocene transition. The predominance of local factors relates to inherent geomorphological process-response mechanisms that were triggered by the EHM eruption. Rapid crater infilling and its completion by the mid-Holocene are attributed to a combination of small storage capacity and geomorphological activity. A late Boreal interval of significant lake-level fall can, however, be attributed to a period of continental-scale climate change as recorded in other European lacustrine settings. Our findings highlight the importance of utilizing geomorphological information to reveal the relative significance of local controls as opposed to climate control when investigating small-sized lake settings with active sediment supply systems.

In order to understand the changes of fish assemblage structure in the process of ecological stocking and effectively, the existing fish community in Daye Lake which was divided into 9 sites was evaluated in the summer of 2019 and 2020, and fish resources were investigated by traditional fishing and eDNA metabarcoding technology. The results showed that 33 species belonging to 18 genera, 6 families and 4 orders of fish were investigated in Daye Lake based on traditional fishing methods. Among them, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix and Hypophthalmichthys nobilis were the dominant species in Daye Lake all year round, and the dominant group was omnivorous, middle-lower fish. And the fish communities at the same point at different times were similar, the separation degree of fish communities was relatively high among different locations. Based on eDNA metabarcoding technology, the mitochondrial COI (cytochrome oxidase I) and 12S rRNA gene regions of eDNA were amplified respectively. A total of 10 species of freshwater lake fish were detected, of which 7 were detected together with traditional methods. Alpha and Beta diversity analysis showed that GJQ had the lowest species diversity, DW and LJH had the highest species diversity, and the biodiversity of adjacent sites was relatively similar. This study proved that ecological stocking will not have a great impact on the diversity of fish populations in lakes. At the same time, it proved the effectiveness of eDNA metabarcoding technology in fish diversity investigation.																				2666-4453					2022	3						18	25		10.1016/j.watcyc.2022.01.002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watcyc.2022.01.002													WOS:001224454900001

In order to meet the needs of industrial and domestic water in the Yuqia Basin, numerical simulation was used to evaluate the groundwater resources and potential for exploitation. The results showed that the mathematical model and calculation parameters used were mainly in accordance with practical situation. The calculated value of the underground water level is consistent with measured value during the period of identification and validation. The total recharge of groundwater resources was 22.02x10(4) m(3)/d, and the total drainage was 21.95x10(4) m(3)/d at present. The Yuqia River leakage is the main supply source of groundwater. There is no significant effect on area of wetland when water source place exploited by 2.5x10(4) m(3)/d at alluvial-diluvial fan of Yuqia River. After long-term exploitation, the spring flow reduces from 1.42x10(4) m(3)/d to 1.01x10(4) m(3)/d and wetland area reduces by 32.7% of original area. The calculation of water balance shows that it is safe to the Yuqia Basin, Da Qiadam Lake, the Mahai Basin at downstream of Yuqia River and wetland under the condition of water source place exploited by 2.5x10(4) m(3)/d.

Volcanic hazards of the Colli Albani	COLLI ALBANI VOLCANO	Special Publications of IAVCEI											Although controversy exists about the age of its most recent eruption (either 36 ka or <23 ka), Colli Albani volcano is unanimously considered to be quiescent and not exinct. During the Holocene, several lahars were generated by overflows from Albano crater lake up to the fourth century BCE, when the Romans excavated a drainage tunnel to keep the lake level below the crater rim. Such recent activity, together with the frequent occurrence of seismic swarms underneath the crater zone, the ongoing uplift of the volcanic edifice and the magmatic affinity of the emitted gas, indicate the presence of an active magma chamber. The most likely site for a new eruption is the deep crater hosted in the southern part of the Lake Albano, where the last eruptive events occurred. Any eruption would have a strong explosive character enhanced by the interaction of magma with the water of the lake and would endanger a densely inhabited area up to the outskirts of Rome. The hazard of a new overflow from Lake Albano is very low because of the present low level of the lake. There is instead a potential for CO2 release from the deep lake water following the occurrence of rollovers, which would threaten the lake shore, a site where thousands of people spend their vacations in the summer. However, the content of dissolved CO2 is presently far from saturation and no Nyos-type events will occur today. Presently, the main hazard is related to strong gas emissions (CO2, H2S and Rn) from fractured zones and gas blowouts from wells reaching shallow gas-pressurized aquifers.

Abundance of adult wild female lake trout and densities of age-0 fish both increased during the 28-year period. A significant positive, linear relationship (P = 0.0002) was found between the abundance of wild females on the spawning reef in the fall and density of age-0 lake trout on adjacent nursery grounds in August and September of the following year. The abundance of hatchery-origin females did not explain significant amounts (P = 0.107) of variation in recruitment. We concluded that most recruitment in 1965-1992 was the result of natural reproduction of wild females. After 28 years of recovery the Gull Island Shoal lake trout population appears to have additional capacity to increase because the stock-recruitment relationship is still linear. Therefore, restoration periods on the order of 30 years may be needed for other lake trout populations in the Great Lakes. We recommend that the refuge established to protect this population be maintained to allow further study of the relationship between parental stock and recruitment, and to provide a major source of recruitment to the lake trout population in the surrounding waters.																			0380-1330						1995	21			1			225	232		10.1016/S0380-1330(95)71095-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(95)71095-4													WOS:A1995UL89400018
J	Burrell, M; Grosse, C; Mark, B				Burrell, Melissa; Grosse, Corrie; Mark, Brigid			Resistance to petro-hegemony: A three terrains of power analysis of the Line 3 tar sands pipeline in Minnesota	ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE												In northern Minnesota, the Line 3 tar sands pipeline crosses Indigenous treaty territory, the Mississippi River, and wild rice lakes. Despite the severity of climate crisis and widespread public opposition, Canadian pipeline company Enbridge succeeded in securing permits for, constructing, and ultimately running oil in the pipeline in fall 2021. How was this possible and how did the climate justice movement try to resist? Drawing on participant observation and interviews in the Stop Line 3 movement, this article employs LeQuesne's (2019) concepts of petro-hegemony and carbon rebellion to explain why Line 3 was approved and to assess water protectors' resistance. Analyzing three terrains of power, we find that: 1) the petro-state of Minnesota employed coercion through undemocratic, colonized, and militarized permitting processes and construction; 2) Enbridge manu-factured consent through a petro-culture that framed water protectors as dangerous, highlighted economic ben-efits to rural towns, and co-opted Indigenous voices; and, 3) by overstating its contributions to jobs and taxes, Enbridge tried to secure broad compliance to the pipeline through petro-capitalism, but ultimately failed. Water protectors intervened in all three of these terrains of power by using legal avenues to shake the petro-state, creating cultures to refuse colonialism and embrace climate justice within water protector camps, and build-ing an Indigenous-led renewable energy economy. We contribute a joint analysis of petro-hegemony and carbon rebellion that reveals the need for balanced and stronger resistance in all three terrains of power to stop future petro-projects and dismantle existing petro-infrastructure.

J	Sheridan, PF				Sheridan, Peter F.			Synoptic-flow interaction with valley cold-air pools and effects on cold-air pool persistence: Influence of valley size and atmospheric stability	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												Idealized two-dimensional simulations have been used to examine the dependence of valley cold-air pool (CAP) behaviour, morphology and duration (persistence) on terrain scale. The simulations use terrain of constant aspect ratio but ranging from modest to Alpine scale, under midlatitude winter conditions with a finite background flow and incorporating a diurnal cycle. CAPs in smaller valleys are found to be more morphologically constrained, whereas larger valleys provide scope for more complex flow dynamics and more dramatic interplay of the external flow with the valley, including gravity wave breaking. Simulations of a valley within a plateau show that, as valley depth exceeds the depth-scale of the nocturnal stable boundary layer, the CAP becomes increasingly confined and sheltered from the background flow (reduced mixing), becoming harder to remove by processes related to daytime insolation, and it can eventually become persistent (never removed). Both the surrounding terrain and gravity wave dynamics are found to play a part in the enhancement of sheltering. Therefore background atmospheric stability and wind are also crucial, summarized in a non-dimensional valley depth parameter which largely determines CAP duration. More stable conditions, representative of (for instance) large-scale subsidence or warm advection aloft, result in longer durations and a greater likelihood of persistence. Stronger nocturnal radiative cooling results in stronger CAPs, which are harder again to remove. Several mechanisms appear to act in concert to give rise to these behaviours and the dependence on non-dimensional valley depth. Replacing the valley-in-plateau with a double hill enhances wave breaking, which complicates the relationship to non-dimensional valley depth, reducing CAP duration significantly when subsidence or warm advection-like effects are absent.																			0035-9009	1477-870X				APR	2019	145	721					1636	1659		10.1002/qj.3517	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/qj.3517													WOS:000474149700022

Water quality and phytoplankton communities in Lake Pontchartrain during and after the Bonnet Carr, Spillway opening, April to October 2008, in Louisiana, USA	GEO-MARINE LETTERS												The Bonnet Carr, Spillway, located 28 miles northwest of New Orleans, was constructed in the early 1930s as part of an integrated flood-control system for the lower Mississippi River system. From 11 April to 8 May 2008, Mississippi River water was diverted through the spillway into the 629-square-mile Lake Pontchartrain, which is hydraulically connected to the Gulf of Mexico. On 8 April, prior to the opening of the spillway, water-quality instruments were deployed and recorded hourly measurements of water temperature, dissolved oxygen, specific conductance, pH, and nitrate. Discrete water-quality and phytoplankton (algae) samples were collected in Lake Pontchartrain from 8 April to 3 October 2008 to assess the water-quality nutrient enrichment effects of the diversion on the lake. The maximum influence of river water in the southern portion of the lake was captured with continuous (hourly) monitoring of nitrate concentrations, and field measurements such as of specific conductance during the critical period in late April to early May. By late May, the deployed instruments had recorded the arrival, peak, and decline of selected constituents associated with the freshwater influx from the Mississippi River/Bonnet Carr, Spillway diversion. The continuous monitoring data showed the short-term interactions of high-nitrate, low-specific conductance river water and low-nitrate, high-specific conductance lake water. The phytoplankton community composition, as an indicator of water quality, illustrated an extended response from the river water evident even after the continuous and discrete samples indicated that the lake had returned to pre-diversion conditions. The initial phytoplankton community response to nutrient increases was related to accumulations of diatoms. During periods of low nutrient concentrations, accumulations of blue-greens occurred by July and August. As blue-green algae cell densities and biovolumes increased in the summer, so did the species richness of blue-green algae, particularly the harmful algae bloom taxa. Cell densities and biovolume of the phytoplankton lake indicator taxa Skeletonema costatum, Anabaena sp., and Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii were highest and dominated the diatom and blue-green algae communities during the period of most river water influence on the lake and immediately following the freshwater inflows. The dominance and recession of these indictor taxa reflect the dramatic changes that occurred in the phytoplankton community in response to an increase in nutrient-rich freshwater from the diversion into the lake, and not normal seasonal phytoplankton compositional differences. Water-quality data indicated a gradual reversion to pre-diversion lake conditions by June to July, but shifts in the phytoplankton composition were still evident through August 2008. Observations from this study were similar to results from previous studies of Mississippi River/Bonnet Carr, Spillway diversion opening in 1997.																			0276-0460					DEC	2009	29	6					431	440		10.1007/s00367-009-0157-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00367-009-0157-3													WOS:000271949800008

We analyzed the strontium isotopes of various materials unearthed from the site, providing results that fill gaps in relevant data about the Boeotia area within the Sub-Pelagonian zone on the Sr-87/Sr-86 signature map of the Aegean region. The results show that the Sr-87/Sr-86 values of the human teeth from different phases generally fall within with the local Sr-87/Sr-86 range; thus, no migrants were identified at any period, indicating the people were either all locally born or moved from a region without evident geological variations compared to the study site. The results also imply that the foraging patterns of the equids and bovines were obviously different. The Sr-87/Sr-86 values of the equids tended to be more "nonlocal" than those of most bovines. The intratooth variation reflected by equid individuals generally follows three main patterns, with a tendency of premortal adaption to the local dietary conditions, and some equids probably foraged somewhere outside the distribution of Karst predominant in Kopais Basin. This study also suggests that the shells were most likely collected from Kopais Lake, which possibly had a slightly lower Sr-87/Sr-86 value than the present local value.					; JIN, ZhengYao/K-1741-2015; HUANG, FANG/JBS-3517-2023	Huang, Fang/0000-0003-1885-3311; 													1040-6182	1873-4553				MAR 1	2019	508						13	22		10.1016/j.quaint.2018.10.009	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2018.10.009													WOS:000464133900002

A periphyton-based diet results in an increased growth rate compared to a detritus-based diet in the invasive New Zealand mud snail (Potamopyrgus antipodarum)	AMERICAN MALACOLOGICAL BULLETIN												The invasive New Zealand mud snail, Potamopyrgus antipodarum (Gray 1843), has been present in the Laurentian Great Lakes for at least 20 years. Recently, the snail has spread to streams that empty into Lake Ontario. In the deep waters of Lake Ontario, detritus is the common food source for the snails; while in streams periphyton becomes an important part of their diet. This experiment was designed to test the hypothesis that a diet of periphyton will lead to a higher growth rate compared to detritus. Benthic sediment was collected from 18 m depth in Lake Erie. Periphyton was grown on small rocks collected from Spring Run stream in central Pennsylvania. Eighty juvenile snails (0.6-1.0 mm in length) were placed individually into plastic cups and divided into four treatments: control snails that were fed Spirulina powder (standard lab diet), snails kept in lake sediment, snails reared on rocks with periphyton growth, and snails in a combination habitat of rock and lake sediment. After six weeks, the snails were measured again. Snails in the periphyton-only treatment had a significantly greater growth rate than snails in the remaining treatments. The other three treatments resulted in similarly low growth rates. These results suggest that the change in diet from detritus-based to periphyton-based as the snails move from a lake to a stream environment may result in higher individual and possibly population growth rates, and thus could increase their invasion success.

We use the outputs of iCAM5 model to quantify the different moisture contribution to local precipitation delta O-18 and to understand the climate controls of precipitation delta O-18 in the TP based on water-tagging. The model shows some deficiencies in simulating the spatial and temporal characteristics of precipitation delta O-18 and the local climatic controls across the TP. Among all the tagged source regions, South Asia and the Indian Ocean contribute the most to the precipitation delta O-18 in the monsoon-controlled domain, followed by the East Asia source region. The westerlies are identified as major moisture sources to the precipitation delta O-18 in the westerlies-controlled domain. South Asia and the Indian Ocean also contribute substantially for the westerlies-controlled domain. On interannual time scales, summer precipitation delta O-18 in the monsoon-controlled domain is dominated by rainout processes occurring along the moisture transport pathway, indicating that precipitation delta O-18 variations here potentially record changes in the regional upstream convection. The delta O-18 signal can be altered by changes in the moisture source location, which implies that enhanced moisture delivery from remote source regions leads to more negative precipitation delta O-18 due to an increase in the rainout effect during transport. Our results have implications for the interpretation of past variations of archives with precipitation stable isotopes, such as ice cores, tree rings, lake sediments, and speleothems in the TP and surrounding regions.

This paper reviews the geochemical characteristics of boron, its isotopic fractionation, and the distribution and genesis of major boron deposits globally. Boron shows significant variation in its natural distribution. The continental crust has significantly higher boron concentrations compared to the mantle. During various geological processes, boron tends to undergo differentiation, leading to the boron isotopic fractionation across different reservoirs. The enrichment of boron in the crust leads to the formation of borate minerals. Understanding the formation and transition conditions of the borate minerals, such as temperature, pressure, and oxygen fugacity, is crucial for understanding the genesis of boron deposits. This paper introduces the mineral assemblage and formation mechanisms of several major types of boron deposits, including volcanic-sedimentary, modern salt lake, marine evaporite, skarn-type, and sedimentary-metamorphic borate deposits. China also hosts different types of boron deposits, with the most significant reserves found in two areas; the sedimentary- metamorphic deposits in the Liaoning-Jilin area and the salt lake deposits in the Qinghai-Xizang area. This paper provides a detailed overview of these prominent borate deposits, including their mineral assemblage, occurrences, ages, and metallogenic models. Based on previous studies, the key scientific questions for future research are discussed.

Mortality event in freshwater drum Aplodinotus grunniens from Lake Ontario, Canada, associated with viral haemorrhagic septicemia virus, Type IV	DISEASES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS												A mortality event primarily affecting freshwater drum Aplodinotus grunniens was noted during April and May 2005 in the Bay of Quinte, Lake Ontario, Canada. A conservative estimate of the number of dead drum was approximately 100 metric tonnes. Large numbers of dead round goby Neogobius melanostomus were also seen, as well as a few muskellunge Esox masquinongy. In the drum, there was a consistent histological pattern of variably severe panvasculitis, a necrotising myocarditis, meningoencephalitis and a segmental enteritis. Moderate numbers of bullet-shaped viral particles consistent with a rhabdovirus were identified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in affected heart tissue. Following primary isolation from pooled tissues on fathead minnow (FHM) cells, a morphologically similar virus, similar to 165 x 60 nm in size, was visualised. Identification of the isolate as viral haemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) was confirmed by enzyme immunoassay and by polymerase chain reaction. An appropriately sized product (468 bp) of the G-glycoprotein gene (nucleotides [nt] 340 to 807) was generated with RNA extracted from FHM cell supernatant. Analysis of a 360 nt partial glycoprotein gene sequence (nt 360 to 720) indicated a 96.4 to 97.2 % nucleotide identity with known strains of North American (NA) VHSV. Analysis using Neighbour-joining distance methods assigned the isolate to the same lineage as the NA and Japanese isolates (Genogroup IV). However, there was sufficient sequence divergence from known NA VHSV isolates to suggest that this isolate may represent a distinct subgroup. The effects of ongoing mortality in freshwater drum and in multiple species during spring 2006 suggest that this newly recognised virus in the Great Lakes will have continued impact in the near future.																			0177-5103	1616-1580				JUN 29	2007	76	2					99	111		10.3354/dao076099	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/dao076099								17760383					WOS:000248405700002
J	Lange, RA; Carmichael, ISE				Lange, RA; Carmichael, ISE			The Aurora volcanic field, California-Nevada: Oxygen fugacity constraints on the development of andesitic magma	CONTRIBUTIONS TO MINERALOGY AND PETROLOGY												The Aurora volcanic field, located along the northeastern margin of Mono Lake in the Western Great Basin, has erupted a diverse suite of high-K and shoshonitic lava types, with 48 to 76 wt% SiO2, over the last 3.6 million years. There is no correlation between the age and composition of the lavas. Three-quarters of the volcanic field consists of evolved (<4 wt% MgO) basaltic andesite and andesite lava cones and flows, the majority of which contain sparse, euhedral phenocrysts that are normally zoned; there is no evidence of mixed, hybrid magmas. The average eruption rate over this time period was similar to 200 m(3)/km(2)/year, which is typical of continental arcs and an order of magnitude lower than that for the slow-spreading mid-Atlantic ridge. All of the Aurora lavas display a trace-element signature common to subduction-related magmas, as exemplified by Ba/Nb ratios between 52 and 151. Pre-eruptive water contents ranged from 1.5 wt% in plagioclase-rich two-pyroxene andesites to similar to 6 wt% in a single hornblende lamprophyre and several biotite-hornblende andesites. Calculated oxygen fugacities fall within -0.4 and +2.4 log units of the Ni-NiO buffer. The Aurora potassic suite follows a classic, calc-alkaline trend in a plot of FeOT/MgO vs SiO2 and displays linear decreasing trends in FeOT and TiO2 with SiO2 content, suggesting a prominent role for Fe-Ti oxides during differentiation. However, development of the calc-alkaline trend through fractional crystallization of titanomagnetite would have caused the residual liquid to become so depleted in ferric iron that its oxygen fugacity would have fallen several log units below that of the Ni-NiO buffer. Nor can fractionation of hornblende be invoked, since it has the same effect as titanomagnetite in depleting the residual liquid in ferric iron, together with a thermal stability limit that is lower than the eruption temperatures of several andesites (similar to 1040-1080 degrees C; derived from two-pyroxene thermometry). Unless some progressive oxidation process occurs, fractionation of titanomagnetite or hornblende cannot explain a calc-alkaline trend in which all erupted lavas have oxygen fugacites greater than or equal to the Ni-NiO buffer. In contrast to fractional crystallization, closed-system equilibrium crystallization will produce residual liquids with an oxygen fugacity that is similar to that of the initial melt. However, the eruption of nearly aphryic lavas argues against tapping from a magma chamber during equilibrium crystallization, a process that requires crystals to remain in contact with the liquid. A preferred model involves the accumulation of basaltic magmas at the mantle-crust interface, which solidify and are later remelted during repeated intrusion of basalt. As an end-member case, closed-system equilibrium crystallization of a basalt, followed by equilibrium partial melting of the gabbro will produce a calc-alkaline evolved liquid (namely, high SiO2 and low FeOT/MgO) with a relative f(o2) (corrected for the effect of changing temperature) that is similar to that of the initial basalt. Differentiation of the Aurora magmas by repeated partial melting of previous underplates in the lower crust rather than by crystal fractionation in large, stable magma chambers is consistent with the low eruption rate at the Aurora volcanic field.																			0010-7999					OCT	1996	125	2-3					167	185		10.1007/s004100050214	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s004100050214													WOS:A1996VP03800005

Loading and lake circulation structures recurrent patterns of water quality on the Toronto - Mississauga waterfront of Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Urban centers line western Lake Ontario where urban rivers, wastewater treatment plants and stormwater load nutrients, major ions and suspended solids to the nearshore. In 2018, nearshore water quality and associated physical conditions bordering the cities of Toronto and Mississauga were assessed as a benchmark for future effects of urban growth and municipal infrastructure projects to improve water quality. Conductivity and UV-fluorescence were used as water quality surrogates and mapped over blocks of shoreline stratified by distance offshore. Patterns in UV-fluorescence aligned with loading points, and generally higher levels near the shoreline, were correlated with concentrations of nutrients, major ions and suspended solids. Water quality was more land-impacted over the shoreline from the Credit River to Humber Bay contrasting with the more lake-like conditions from Toronto Eastern Beaches to the Rouge River. Within Toronto Harbour, cross-harbour gradients in water quality varied with weather related changes in river and storm water loading. Mixing areas at wastewater treatment plant outfalls and tributary mouths, frequently shaped by alongshore lake circulation, resulted in a mosaic of water quality over the shoreline. Area-wide elevation of chloride and conductivity, and poorer water quality in late spring, was linked to heightened river discharge. Thermal stratification affected how discharges were distributed in the water column, but measurements at the lake surface reflected the strongest overall land-effects on water quality. The patterns of temporal-spatial variability identified within geographically-defined areas of shoreline can be used as past footprints in future monitoring to detect change.

J	Uri, ND; Lewis, JA				Uri, ND; Lewis, JA			The dynamics of soil erosion in US agriculture	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Soil erosion has both on-farm and off-farm impacts. Reduction of soil depth can impair the land's productivity, and the transport of sediments can degrade streams, lakes, and estuaries. To address this problem, soil conservation policies have existed in the United States for over 60 years. Initially, these policies focused on the on-farm benefits of keeping soil on the land and increasing net farm income. Beginning in the 1980s, however, policy goals increasingly included reductions in off-site impacts of erosion. The Food Security Act of 1985 was the first major legislation explicitly to tie eligibility to receive agricultural program payments to conservation performance. The Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act (FAIR) of 1996 modifies the conservation compliance provisions by providing farmers with greater flexibility in developing and implementing conservation plans. As a consequence of conservation efforts, total soil erosion between 1982 and 1997 was reduced by 42% and the erosion rate fell from 8.0 tons per acre in 1982 to 5.2 tons per acre in 1997. Still, soil erosion is imposing substantial social costs. In 1997 these costs are estimated to have been approx. US$29.7 billion. To further reduce soil erosion and thereby mitigate its social costs, there are a number of policy options available to induce farmers to adopt conservation practices including education and technical assistance, financial assistance, research and development, land retirement, and regulation and taxes.

Variation of cisco egg size among Laurentian Great Lakes populations	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Many fish species display inter-population and inter-individual egg size variation. Intra-specific differences in egg size seemingly reflect both energetic experiences of individual spawning fish and longterm population responses to differing ecosystems. Optimal egg size theory implies that selection influences a population's mean egg size in response to its early-life environment, given the well-established trade-off between egg size and fecundity. Currently, there is strong interest in rehabilitation of Laurentian Great Lakes cisco, Coregonus artedi, which is characterized by inter-population variation of morphological and behavioral traits. However, the extent of cisco egg size variation is under-described. In fall 2018 and 2019, we collected egg samples by stripping ripe females at seven total locations in four Great Lakes. We measured unfertilized egg diameters using imaging software and compared mean egg diameters among locations with and without including maternal total length as a covariate. Lake Michigan females produced the largest eggs overall but were excluded from analyses using the total length covariate because of their significantly larger body sizes. Maternal length had a positive effect on egg size, and when accounting for this effect, females in Lake Huron produced the largest eggs followed by Lake Ontario and Lake Superior. We also found that egg size varied among locations within Lake Superior. These findings aligned with observations of morphological and behavioral differences among populations and suggest that cisco phenotypic variation at a fine spatial scale extends to reproductive biology. Consideration of cisco reproductive traits, such as egg size, may inform restoration strategies, including supplemental stocking.Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of International Association for Great Lakes Research.

The evolutionary ecology of alternative migratory tactics in salmonid fishes	BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS												Extensive individual variation in spatial behaviour is a common feature among species that exhibit migratory life cycles. Nowhere is this more evident than in salmonid fishes; individual fish may complete their entire life cycle in freshwater streams, others may migrate variable distances at sea and yet others limit their migrations to larger rivers or lakes before returning to freshwater streams to spawn. This review presents evidence that individual variation in migratory behaviour and physiology in salmonid fishes is controlled by developmental thresholds and that part of the variation in proximal traits activating the development of alternative migratory tactics is genetically based. We summarize evidence that alternative migratory tactics co-exist within populations and that all individuals may potentially adopt any of the alternative phenotypes. Even though intra-specific genetic divergence of migratory tactics is uncommon, it may occur if female competition for oviposition sites results in spawning segregation of alternative phenotypes. Because of their polygenic nature, alternative migratory tactics are considered as threshold traits. Threshold traits have two characteristics: an underlying 'liability' trait that varies in a continuous fashion, and a threshold value which is responsible for the discreetness observed in phenotypic distribution. We review evidence demonstrating that body size is an adequate proxy for the liability trait controlling the decision to migrate, but that the same phenotypic outcome (anadromy or residency) may be reached by different developmental pathways. The evidence suggesting a significant heritable component in the development of alternative migratory tactics is subsequently reviewed, leading us to conclude that alternative migratory tactics have considerable potential to respond to selection and evolve. We review what is known about the proximal physiological mechanisms mediating the translation of the continuous value of the liability trait into a discontinuous migratory tactic. We conclude by identifying several avenues for future research, including testing the frequency-dependent selection hypothesis, establishing the relative importance of adaptive phenotypic plasticity in explaining some geographic gradients in migratory behaviour and identifying the physiological and genetic basis of the switching mechanisms responsible for alternative migratory tactics.

Dust storms and their horizontal dust loading in the Sistan region, Iran	AEOLIAN RESEARCH												The Sistan region in southeast Iran is considered as one of the most active dust source regions in South west Asia. The strong "Levar" winds in summer favor the uplift of large quantities of dust from the Hamoun basin, which is located in the northern part of Sistan. After a dry period at the end of the 1999s, and due to land-use change and desiccation of the Hamoun lakes, the frequency and severity of dust storms have been significantly increased. Within this framework, this study analyses the aerosol characteristics, dust loading and air quality over the Sistan region. The dust loading was measured using dust traps up to four and eight meters height (with a one meter distance between the traps) at two locations near the Hamoun basin during the period August 2009 to July 2010. The results show large quantities of transported dust that strongly dependent on the duration of the dust events, and secondarily, on the wind speed and distance from the source region. The grain size distribution of the dusts reveals that the coarser calibers are found at the station nearer to Hamoun, while the large differences in the grain-size distribution found between the two stations indicate significant spatio-temporal variation in dust characteristics. Furthermore, to assess the air quality, Particulate Matter (PM10) concentrations were measured over Zabol city during September 2010 to July 2011, and the Air Quality Index (AQI) was obtained. Daily PM10 levels during intense dust storms rise up to 2000 mu g m(-3), even reaching to 3094 mu g m(-3), while the monthly mean PM10 variation shows extreme values (>500 mu g m(-3)) for the period June to October. Analysis of the AQI shows that 61% of the days are associated with a high health risk, while 30.1% are even identified as hazardous. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Allen			Macrophyte mediated predation on hydrilla-dwelling macroinvertebrates	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												Hydrilla verticillata invaded south central Louisiana during the 1970s, and subsequently became the dominant submerged macrophyte in floodplain habitats of the Atchafalaya River Basin. Effects of hydrilla on littoral habitat structure, water quality, fish, and macroinvertebrates have been pervasive. Hydrilla can reduce water column dissolved oxygen, harbor different macroinvertebrate communities compared to native macrophytes, and can negatively affect fish feeding and growth. We hypothesized that dense hydrilla stands would also impact vertebrate predation on resident macroinvertebrates, although predation effects would likely be mediated by bed position. During 2003 and 2004, we conducted exclosure experiments in the Atchafalaya River Basin with artificial substrates to test for variations in hydrilla bed macroinvertebrate communities caused by predation, plant architecture, and bed position. To determine the quantity of invertebrates consumed by fishes, we also examined stomach contents of potentially invertivorous fishes inhabiting these beds. We found that bed position and predation were important in structuring macroinvertebrate communities, whereas plant architecture had little effect. Diet analyses indicated that littoral fishes fell into three categories: 1) those that did not feed on macroinvertebrates; 2) those that fed on small invertebrates (e.g., dipterans); and 3) those that fed on large invertebrates (e.g., decapods) and poeciliid fishes. Further, the diets of the invertivorous fishes coincided with spatial distributions of the littoral macroinvertebrate community. In general, those macroinvertebrates most commonly found in fish diets occurred in greater densities within the bed interior. This study demonstrated that hydrilla beds appear to provide a refuge from fish predation for resident macroinvertebrates, which may be an important aspect of macrophyte management strategies.																			1863-9135					JUN	2012	181	1					25	38		10.1127/1863-9135/2012/0174	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/1863-9135/2012/0174													WOS:000308084600003

Diversity and taxonomy of intertidal Bryozoa (Cheilostomata) at Akkeshi Bay, Hokkaido, Japan	JOURNAL OF NATURAL HISTORY												We found 39 cheilostome species among more than 7000 specimens collected at 10 intertidal sites in rocky habitats along the shore of Akkeshi Bay, eastern Hokkaido Island, Japan. These species are herein described in detail and illustrated by scanning electron microscopy. Nine species (23% of total) are described as new (Electra asiatica, Callopora sarae, Conopeum nakanosum, Cauloramphus cryptoarmatus, Cauloramphus multispinosus, Cauloramphus niger, Stomachetosella decorata, Microporella luellae, and Celleporina minima), and 21 species (54%) are reported for the first time from Japan. Species richness ranged from eight to 29 species per study site. A TWINSPAN analysis showed the species fell into nine groups defined by the local pattern of distribution. A cluster analysis of study sites based on similarity of species composition showed three faunistic groups distributed geographically: in Akkeshi Lake, along the eastern-central shore of the bay, and at the mouth of the bay. Species richness in estuarine Akkeshi Lake was low, with a species composition very different from the outer bay. Most cheilostomes were found on rock and shell substrata, but uncommonly occurred on concrete walls, algae, hydroids, tubes of polychaetes, other bryozoans, and anthropogenic debris. Of the 39 species found, 33 (85%) contained embryos during the collecting periods, 2-7 June and 3-6 July 2004. The biogeographical composition of intertidal cheilostomes at Akkeshi Bay included species with Arctic-Boreal (28%), Boreal (59%), and Boreal-Subtropical (13%) distributions. The overall species richness of intertidal cheilostomes was two-thirds that documented intertidally in a comparable study at Kodiak, Alaska, a locality 15 degrees higher in latitude. We attribute the lower richness at Akkeshi to differences in the nearshore marine environment between the two localities.

J	BRUNBERG, AK				BRUNBERG, AK			MICROBIAL ACTIVITY AND PHOSPHORUS DYNAMICS IN EUTROPHIC LAKE-SEDIMENTS ENRICHED WITH MICROCYSTIS COLONIES	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Sediments from hypereutrophic Lake Vallentunasjon were enriched with Microcystis colonies from the lake water, thereby simulating the conditions after the autumn sedimentation. Release of phosphorus to the overlying lake water was followed during 2-3 weeks in the laboratory. X-ray microanalysis of individual Microcystis and bacterial cells, and chemical phosphorus fractionation, were used to assess the phosphorus pool size in different fractions of the sediment. 2. Benthic Microcystis colonies, most of these having survived within the sediment for 1 year or more, were less susceptible to decomposition, and the specific growth rate of bacteria in their mucilage was lower than for other sediment bacteria. 3. Pelagic Microcystis colonies from late August were resistant to decomposition, when placed on the sediments. When Microcystis colonies from a declining pelagic population in October were added to the sediments, however, a substantial fraction of these colonies was decomposed. The specific growth rate of mucilage bacteria was five times higher than for other sediment bacteria. 4. Release of molybdate-reactive phosphorus to the overlying lake water was larger from sediment cores enriched with Microcystis colonies than from control cores. Chemical phosphorus fractionation showed a decrease in organic-bound phosphorus (residual P). 5. X-ray microanalysis showed that the phosphorus bound in Microcystis cells decreased by -0.300 mg g(-1) DW in the October experiment, due both to a decrease in biomass (i.e. mineralization) and to a decrease in phosphorus content in the remaining cells. Heterotrophic bacteria increased their cellular concentration of phosphorus. The net release of phosphorus from the Microcystis and bacterial pools corresponded to 74% of the decrease of organic-bound phosphorus in the chemical phosphorus fractionation, and to 65% of the decrease of total phosphorus in the upper 0-1 cm of the sediment. 6. Benthic bacteria and cyanobacteria may thus contribute significantly to changes in phosphorus content and turnover of the sediment by changes in their biomass, turnover rate and cellular phosphorus content.																			0046-5070					JUN	1995	33	3					541	555		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1995.tb00412.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1995.tb00412.x													WOS:A1995RE17800017

Clarifying the distal to proximal tephrochronology of the Millennium (B-Tm) eruption, Changbaishan Volcano, northeast China	QUATERNARY GEOCHRONOLOGY												Tephra dispersed during the Millennium eruption (ME), Changbaishan Volcano, NE China provides one of the key stratigraphic links between Asia and Greenland for the synchronization of palaeoenvironmental records. However, controversy surrounds proximal-distal tephra correlations because (a) the proposed proximal correlatives of the distal ME tephra (i.e. B-Tm) lack an unequivocal chronostratigraphic context, and (b) the ME tephra deposits have not been chemically characterized for a full spectrum of element using grain-specific techniques. Here we present grain-specific glass chemistry, including for the first time, single grain trace element data, for a composite proximal sequence and a distal tephra from Lake Kushu, northern Japan (ca.1100 km away from Changbaishan). We demonstrate a robust proximal distal correlation and that the Kushu tephra is chemically associated with the ME/B Tm. We propose that three of the proximal pyroclastic fall units were erupted as part of the ME. The radiocarbon chronology of the Kushu sedimentary record has been utilised to generate a Bayesian age-depth model, providing an age for the Kushu tephra which is consistent with high resolution ages determined for the eruption and therefore supports our geochemical correlation. Two further Bayesian age-depth models were independently constructed each incorporating one of two ice-core derived ages for the B-Tm tephra, providing Bayesian modelled ages of 933-949 and 944-947 cal AD (95.4%) for the Kushu tephra. The high resolution ice-core tephra ages imported into the deposition models help test and ultimately constrain the radiocarbon chronology in this interval of the Lake Kushu sedimentary record. The observed geochemical diversity between proximal and distal ME tephra deposits clearly evidences the interaction of two compositionally distinct magma batches during this caldera forming eruption.

The cumulative effects of management on the population dynamics of the Double-crested Cormorant Phalacrocorax auritus in the Great Lakes	IBIS												Wildlife species have been subject to control efforts throughout human history due to real or alleged human-wildlife conflicts. The Double-crested Cormorant Phalacrocorax auritus in the interior of North America is no exception, with recent population growth leading to increased conflicts and consequently the development of many control programmes. These control programmes are usually conducted at local scales, often with little or no effort to assess their cumulative effects at the population level. We attempted the first comprehensive assessment of the cumulative effects of control at various spatio-temporal scales, focusing on 199 colonies of Double-crested Cormorant monitored during a 29-year period. Linear models were used to assess the relationship between colony-specific growth rates and a set of candidate factors using an information-theoretic approach. Colony-level density-dependent effects and local control efforts had the greatest influences on population growth. We detected a cumulative effect of management, whereby (i) the reduction in population growth rate was generally stronger when different control activities such as culling or egg oiling were combined, and (ii) past control operations tended to have a pervasive impact on growth rates, especially egg oiling and nest destruction, which negatively affected local recruitment. However, our results also suggest that catastrophic events and the culling of breeding adults that occurred at least 2years previously could fuel subsequent recruitment or natural immigration from nearby colonies, for instance if the breeding success of remaining pairs was increased through a diminution of density-dependent regulatory processes. Density-dependence at the metapopulation level constituted a third source of regulation, as local growth rates were reduced with increasing number or proximity of active neighbouring colonies. We also found evidence that the culling of Double-crested Cormorants wintering in the southeastern USA could negatively impact the population growth of individual breeding colonies in the Great Lakes, although further research integrating models of migratory connectivity is needed to reach more definitive conclusions. Finally, despite previous studies emphasizing its importance, the net effect of management-induced dispersal appeared small at large spatial scales. We show that this can be explained in part by control strategies (e.g. spatially clustered operations). The continuation of Cormorant management efforts will provide an opportunity to refine the present assessment of the relative importance of density-dependence, breeding vs. non-breeding season management and dispersal, particularly if population models are coupled with monitoring programmes within an adaptive management framework.					; Guillaumet, Alban/MVW-5830-2025; Wang, Guiming/O-8925-2019; Wang, Guiming/E-4582-2011; Dorr, Brian/AAX-9033-2020	Guillaumet, Alban/0000-0002-1021-7807; Wang, Guiming/0000-0001-5002-0120; Dorr, Brian/0000-0001-6857-8560; 													0019-1019	1474-919X				JAN	2014	156	1					141	152		10.1111/ibi.12109	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ibi.12109													WOS:000328545700012
J	van Frankenhuyzen, K; Ebling, P; Dedes, J; Pitt, D				van Frankenhuyzen, Kees; Ebling, Peter; Dedes, John; Pitt, Doug			Effects off diapause duration on postdiapause performance of spruce budworm (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) during mass rearing on artificial diet	CANADIAN ENTOMOLOGIST												The spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana (Clem.), has an obligatory winter dormancy period that lasts up to 10 months in the field. In the Great Lakes Forestry Centre rearing facility, neonate larvae spin hibernacula in cheesecloth, which is then stored at 2 degrees C for between 20 and 30 weeks. Although dormancy survival and synchrony of postemergence development are highest when larvae are stored in the cold for 16-35 weeks, it is not known how cold-storage duration affects spruce budworm performance once diapause has been completed. We exposed approximately 9250 second-instar larvae (belonging to three rearing cohorts) to 2 degrees C for 16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31, 34, or 37 weeks and monitored various postdiapause performance variables. Increasing cold storage from 16 to 25 weeks or more resulted in small (approximately 10%) increases in dormancy survival and larval development rates (from second instar to pupation), a larger (up to 23%) increase in pupal mass and realized fecundity (number of eggs laid per female), and an increase of at least 25% in late-instar survival (from fifth instar to pupation). The only variable that was negatively affected was the pupal survival, but the decrease was relatively small. Therefore, storing diapausing larvae for at least 25 weeks optimizes postdiapause performance variables that are important for mass-rearing efficiency.																			0008-347X	1918-3240				NOV-DEC	2007	139	6					834	840																WOS:000251806400004
J	Hao, GC; Shi, KB; Han, KW				Hao, Guochen; Shi, Kebin; Han, Kewu			Effect of Artificial Aeration on Evaporation Inhibition under Floating Balls Cover	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												Evaporation from reservoirs in arid plains is a significant concern. To mitigate this, covering the water surface with anti-evaporation materials, such as floating balls, can effectively reduce evaporation and enhance the utilization of water resources. However, during the hot season, the high net radiation absorbed by the surface of the floating balls is converted into sensible heat, which in turn warms the upper layer of the water. This warming effect leads to temperature stratification in shallow water, which reduces the effectiveness of the anti-evaporation materials in inhibiting evaporation. There is a lack of research on strategies to mitigate the surface water warming caused by these materials during the hot season. This study suggests that the reduced performance of evaporation suppression in summer, coupled with the resulting temperature stratification, may pose potential hazards to the aquatic environment. Five groups of evaporators were installed at the top of the reservoir dam, consisting of both covered and uncovered units, with and without aeration and at varying aeration frequencies. These units were designed to eliminate thermal stratification in the upper water column, lower surface water temperatures, and improve the effectiveness of evaporation suppression. The findings indicate that artificial aeration can effectively reduce evaporation in the floating balls cover group, but only during the period of water temperature stratification (May to September). Decomposition coupling calculations of the energy balance for evaporating surfaces under different aeration modes showed that aeration reduced the sensible heat flux of the evaporating surfaces by approximately 9.74% for continuous aeration and 3.42% for intermittent aeration, as well as the latent heat flux by 6.94% and 3.61% respectively, during the hot season, thereby reducing water evaporation. Continuous aeration enhances the anti-evaporation performance by approximately 6.36%. Intermittent aeration, while slightly less effective in improving evaporation inhibition at 4.05%, can effectively mitigate the temperature rise of the bottom water due to the mixing of upper and lower water layers and inhibit the diffusion of sediment pollutants into the overlying water. Current research on the evaporation of covered water surfaces in flowing water bodies at reservoir sites, considering varying times and frequencies of aeration, is still limited and requires further investigation.																			0920-4741	1573-1650				JUN	2025	39	8					3777	3800		10.1007/s11269-025-04129-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-025-04129-2		FEB 2025											WOS:001415582700001

Comparison of split double and triple twists in pair figure skating	SPORTS BIOMECHANICS												In this study, we compared the kinematic variables of the split triple twist with those of the split double twist to help coaches and scientists understand these landmark pair skating skills. High-speed video was taken during the pair short and free programmes at the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics and the 2003 International Skating Union Grand Prix Finals. Three-dimensional analyses of 14 split double twists and 15 split triple twists from eleven pairs were completed. In spite of considerable variability in the performance variables among the pairs, the main difference between the split double twists and split triple twists was an increase in rotational rate. While eight of the eleven pairs relied primarily on an increased rotational rate to complete the split triple twist, three pairs employed a combined strategy of increased rotational rate and increased flight time due predominantly to delayed or lower catches. These results were similar to observations of jumps in singles skating for which the extra rotation is typically due to an increase in rotational velocity; increases in flight time come primarily from delayed landings as opposed to additional height during flight. Combining an increase in flight time and rotational rate may be a good strategy for completing the split triple twist in pair skating.																			1476-3141						2008	7	2					222	237		10.1080/14763140701841662	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14763140701841662								18610774					WOS:000259401500006
J	Friese, K; Herzsprung, P; Witter, B				Friese, K; Herzsprung, P; Witter, B			Photochemical degradation of organic carbon in acidic mining lakes	ACTA HYDROCHIMICA ET HYDROBIOLOGICA												The investigated coal mining lakes of the Lusatian lignite mining district and the mid-German lignite district are geogenically acidified caused by pyrite and marcasite oxidation. All lakes are characterized by high ionic strength and extremely high concentrations of dissolved ferric iron. In oxic water layers, up to 10% of total iron is present as Fe(II). Mean concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) are extremely low in the investigated Lusatian lakes (<0.1 mmol/L). During summer months, DOC concentrations below the detection limit were observed in epilimnetic layers accompanied by increased concentrations of ferrous iron. It is suggested that photochemical reactions are responsible for depletion of DOC and formation of ferrous iron as it has been described for acidic soft-water lakes. The coupling of DOC degradation and ferrous iron production was verified with sunlight exposure experiments. Samples of acidic mining lakes were irradiated in quartz glass vessels. Up to 50% of DOC was transformed to CO2 after 300 min of irradiation with natural sunlight, and the light-induced production of Fe(II) was up to 450% (compared to 100% Fe(II) concentration before irradiation). As a consequence of acidification and photochemical reactions, the carbon budget of investigated mining lakes is kept low because organic carbon is finally oxidized to carbon dioxide which leaves epilimnetic water layers as a gas.

The rapid expansion of the port facility and the primary industries which have developed in the immediate vicinity have entrained a multitude of environmental related issues. Much work is currently being conducted to identify the magnitude of contamination derived from the related industries and quantify the direct environmental and ecotoxicological impact. In addition, solid and liquid urban wastes, together with agricultural activities, have contributed to the pollution of the sediments in the Lagoon. This paper recapitulates the results derived from a number of sampling campaigns aimed at establishing an extensive data base on the spatial distribution of PCDDs and PCDFs in surfacial sediments and selected vertical sediment core profiles. Data is presented for sample transects of individual canals of the Porto Marghera and Venice system as well as a comprehensive distribution of sample locations in the Lagoon. Results are discussed in relation to total PCDD/F concentrations and ITEQs, and compared with existing data in the literature. Specific anomalies in sediment concentrations are interpreted with reference to possible source apportionment and potential contributory events.																					1-57477-127-2				2002							227	237																WOS:000177665400028

Their quality is permanently threatened by: effluent pollution from built-up areas, trade and industry; leaching and washing-out of harmful substances (e.g. liquid manure from agriculture); and accidents and improper handling of substances harmful to water. Besides qualitative considerations, ground-water protection also has an increasingly important quantitative aspect: protection against excessive water diversion, filling in of watercourses, respect for the natural state of water bodies in engineering. In the last decades many rivers and streams have been forced to make roam for housing developments, transport routes and agricultural uses. Flood defences and hydroelectric power generation have limited water's function as a habitat. Ground water, too, is increasingly being restricted, over-used and placed under threat. The goal of water protection is to halt this trend and to keep water supplies, sewerage systems and waste water treatment facilities in their present good working order; it is designed to maintain, and where necessary restore, the quality of water bodies as habitats and structured elements of the landscape. This objective is now an important factor in Swiss integrated storm-water management.																			0735-1917						2000	18	1-2					568	570																WOS:000088720300058

The muscle tissue of the two adult fish species most commonly used as bioindicators in central Europe and whole body homogenates of various species of young-of-the-year (YOY) fish were used. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential to replace adult fish muscle tissue with YOY fish for contamination monitoring. All of the toxic metals and five of the fifteen PFASs were found in the YOY fish samples while only mercury and PFOS were detected in the muscle tissue of adults. The concentration of total mercury (THg) in the YOY fish homogenates ranged between 0.014 and 0.062 mu g g(-1). Of the spectrum of analysed pollutants, only the THg concentrations were lower in YOY fish homogenates than in adult muscle tissue. The cadmium concentration varied from 0.004 to 0.024 mu g g(-1) and the lead concentration varied from 0.032 to 0.396 mu g g(-1) in YOY fish homogenates, while in most of the adult samples, Cd and Pb were below the detection limit of the analytical methods employed. The PFOS concentrations in YOY fish homogenates were comparable to the concentrations frequently found in adult liver tissue. These results show that mixed shoals of YOY fish can be successfully used for aquatic bio-monitoring. Interspecific variability in the concentrations of the target pollutants in YOY fish whole body homogenates is usually lower than the intraspecific variability of the concentrations of the pollutants in adult fish muscle. YOY fish were found to be a suitable bioindicator and have several advantages compared to adult fish. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study investigates the distribution of visitor fatalities in US National Park Service (NPS) units and identifies the predeath activities and contributing factors associated with them. A retrospective study was conducted of visitor fatalities from all NPS units during 2003 and 2004. There were 356 reported fatalities during 2003 and 2004. Fatalities were most common during the summer months and on weekends. Males accounted for 75% of the reported fatalities, and visitors aged 20 to 29 and 50 to 59 years accounted for 51% of all deaths. Only 99 of 388 (26%) NPS units reported at least 1 fatality, and only 10 units reported 10 or more fatalities. However, these 10 units were responsible for 36% of all fatalities. Lake Mead National Recreation Area, Blue Ridge Parkway, Grand Canyon National Park, Great Smoky Mountains National Park, and Yosemite National Park reported the highest number of fatalities. Domestic visitors accounted for 73% of the fatalities, and European visitors accounted for 13%. Transportation and water-based activities recorded the highest number of fatalities. Motor vehicle crashes accounted for 20% of fatalities and was followed by suicide (17%), swimming (11%), hiking (10%), plane crashes (9%), climbing (6%), and boating (5%) incidents. Fatalities in NPS units are not widespread and are related to more common events such as motor vehicle crashes, suicide, swimming, and hiking rather than exotic causes such as bears or other wildlife. It is recommended that preventive techniques first be developed in the 10 NPS units responsible for 36% of the total NPS-wide fatalities.																			1195-1982	1708-8305				NOV-DEC	2008	15	6					404	411		10.1111/j.1708-8305.2008.00235.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1708-8305.2008.00235.x								19090794					WOS:000261205500004
J	Hobson, KA; Hughes, KD; Ewins, PJ				Hobson, KA; Hughes, KD; Ewins, PJ			Using stable-isotope analysis to identify endogenous and exogenous sources of nutrients in eggs of migratory birds: Applications to Great Lakes contaminants research	AUK												Stable-isotope analyses (carbon [C-13/C-12] and sulfur [S-34/S-32]) were performed on eggs of two migratory fish-eating birds, Caspian Terns (Sterna caspia) and Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) collected from Lake Ontario, Canada, to examine the extent to which nutrient reserves acquired on marine wintering grounds are transferred to eggs laid on freshwater breeding grounds. In order to establish isotopic patterns typical of eggs of birds using marine and freshwater C-3 biomes, eggs of Herring Gulls (Larus argentatus), a year-round resident on the Great Lakes, and those of Caspian Terns and Herring Gulls, breeding resepectively in the Gulf Coast of Texas and Atlantic Coast of Canada, were analyzed isotopically. Individual egg components showed distinct isotope values that were similar for both migratory and nonmigratory birds breeding in a freshwater biome and significantly lighter than those breeding in a marine biome. Hence, there appeared to be little evidence for significant nutrient transfer between the two biomes. The intermediate isotope values shown for egg components of Herring Gulls breeding on the Atlantic Coast suggest nutrient input from terrestrial as well as marine sources. Our results indicate the utility of stable-isotope analysis for tracing endogenous and exogenous contributions to reproduction in birds and further validate the use of migratory birds as indicators of breeding area contaminant levels and their effects on the Great Lakes.

Chang 9 sand body mainly developed five basic vertical structures, namely box shape, campaniform, infundibuliform, finger and dentoid. The vertical stacking patterns of multilayer sand body was complex, and the common shapes included box shape + box shape, campaniform + campaniform, campaniform + box shape, infundibuliform + infundibuliform, campaniform + infundibuliform, box shape + campaniform, box shape + infundibuliform, and finger + finger. Based on the analysis on major dominating factors of vertical structure of sand body, sedimentary environment, sedimentary facies and rise, fall and cycle of base level are identified as the major geological factors that control the vertical structure of single sand body as well as vertical stacking patterns and distribution of multistory sand bodies.

Protist genetic diversity in the acidic hydrothermal environments of Lassen Volcanic National Park, USA	JOURNAL OF EUKARYOTIC MICROBIOLOGY												We examined eukaryote genetic diversity in the hydrothermal environments of Lassen Volcanic National Park (LVNP), Northern California. We sampled hydrothermal areas of the Bumpass Hell, Sulfur Works, Devil's Kitchen, and Boiling Springs Lake sites, all of which included diverse acidic pools, mud pots, and streams with visible algal mats and biofilms. Temperatures varied from 15 to 85 degrees C and pH from 1.7 to 5.8. DNA extraction methods compared by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis fingerprinting exhibited similar patterns, and showed limited diversity of eukaryotic small subunit (SSU) rRNA genes compared with prokaryotes. We successfully amplified eukaryotic SSU rRNA genes from most environments up to 68 degrees C. Cloned rDNA sequences reveal acidophilic protists dominate eukaryotes in LVNP hydrothermal environments. Most sites showed phototrophic assemblages dominated by chlorophytes and stramenopiles (diatoms and chrysophytes). Heterotrophic taxa, though less abundant, included diverse alveolates (ciliates), amoebae, and flagellates. Fungi were also found at most sites, and metazoans (hexapods, nematodes, platyhelminths) were sometimes detected in less acidic environments, especially in algal mats. While many cloned rDNA sequences showed 95%-99% identity to known acidophilic isolates or environmental clones from other acidic sites (Rio Tinto), sequence diversity generally declined both with decreasing pH and increasing temperature, and both were controlling physical variables on the abundance and distribution of organisms at our sites. However, a pool at 68 degrees C with pH 1.7 yielded the greatest number of distinct sequences. While some were likely contaminants from nearby cooler sites, we suggest that Lassen's acidic hydrothermal features may harbor novel protists.																			1066-5234	1550-7408				NOV-DEC	2006	53	6					420	431		10.1111/j.1550-7408.2006.00125.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1550-7408.2006.00125.x								17123405					WOS:000242194200002

However, potential risks from exposure to these toxins in contaminated health food products that contain EGA have been largely ignored. EGA products are commonly consumed in the United States, Canada, and Europe for their putative beneficial effects, including increased energy and elevated mood. Many of these products contain Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, a EGA that is harvested from Upper Klamath Lake (UKL) in southern Oregon, where the growth of a toxic EGA, Microcystis aeruginosa, is a regular occurrence. M, aeruginosa produces compounds called microcystins, which are potent hepatotoxins and probable tumor promoters. Because M. aeruginosa coexists with A. flos-aquae, it can be collected inadvertently during the harvesting process, resulting in microcystin contamination of EGA products. In fall 1996, the Oregon Health Division learned that UKL was experiencing an extensive M. aeruginosa bloom, and an advisory was issued recommending against water contact. The advisory prompted calls from consumers of EGA products, who expressed concern about possible contamination of these products with microcystins. In response, the Oregon Health Division and the Oregon Department of Agriculture established a regulatory limit of 1 mu g/g for microcystins in EGA-containing products and tested EGA products for the presence of microcystins. Microcystins were detected in 85 of 87 samples tested, with 63 samples (72%) containing concentrations > 1 mu g/g. HPLC and ELISA tentatively identified microcystin-1R, the most toxic microcystin variant, as the predominant congener.																			0091-6765					MAY	2000	108	5					435	439		10.2307/3454384	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3454384								10811570					WOS:000087140700028

How to find and kill these metastatic cells is an important key to cure cancer. We have isolated over 100 filamentous fungi from soil of extreme environments in Taiwan, including forest, hot spring, lake and fruit tree rhizosphere in order to screen some biologically active compounds. Screening of antimetastatic compounds, we used a set of highly metastatic cell lines, B16-F10 (mouse, melanoma) and HT-1080 (human, fibrosarcoma) and cell lines with low metastatic ability, B16-F1 (mouse, melanoma) and MRC-5 (human, lung, normal diploid fibroblast). Cultures grown in microtiter plates were assayed by SRB (sulforhodamine B) method. The goal for this screening program is to isolate biologically active compounds that can inhibit the growth of highly metastatic cells such as B16-F10 and HT-1080 but little effect on low metastatic cells such as B10-F1 and MRC-5. Some strains' media showed significant differences in cytotoxicity between the highly metastatic cells and the low metastatic cells. These results suggest that some products in these media may contain metastasis-specific or cell-specific toxins.																			1021-9498					MAR	1997	5	1					63	71																WOS:A1997WU64000005

Sources and Generation Parameters of the Hydrocarbon Background of Bottom Sediments in Small Estuaries of the Tatar Strait	GEOCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL												The paper presents data on the composition of organic matter (OM) in the surface layer of bottom sediments (BS) in two small estuaries in the southwestern part of the Tatar Strait (as of summer of 2014 and 2016). The concentration of hydrocarbons (HC) varied from 0.01 to 2.0 mg/g. The HC content in the uniform silt-psammite sediments (0.55-1.47 mg/g) was higher than the biogenic background level (approximate to 0.1 mg/g). The percentage of HC carbon of total C-org(TOC) in the sediments of Muchke Lake (2.68% on average) was much higher than that in Toki Lake and than the value of <= 1% assumed as an indicator of the absence of a hydrocarbon load. The percentage of autochthonous OM (determined from the chlorophyllacontent) in the sediments of weakly flowing Muchke Lake is 41% of TOC, and the value for flowing Toki Lake is 18%. The data obtained in the course of this study are consistent with the molecular composition of then-alkanes: the OM of Muchke Lake is dominated by that of hydrobiont origin, whereas the OM of Toki Lake consists mostly of terrigenous-humic compounds. Then-alkanes contain much compounds typically produced by bacterial synthesis, which indicates that microorganisms played an important role in forming the hydrocarbon background of sediments in the small estuaries.																			0016-7029	1556-1968				AUG	2020	58	8					903	913		10.1134/S0016702920080066	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0016702920080066													WOS:000561850500003

However, PMF-derived source profiles are never compared to real ones because of the absence of data on the chemical composition of source emissions. The aim of this study was to verify the validity of PMF-derived source profiles using the diagnostic ratios (DR) method and end-member mixing analysis (EMMA). The composition of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in particulate matter (PM) sampled in the air above Lake Baikal in summer and the composition of inorganic elements (IE) in PM accumulated in Lake Baikal snowpack were used as study objects. Five PAH sources and five IE sources were identified using PMF. Eight PAHs and six IEs selected from PMF-derived source profiles were recognized as eligible for calculating the DRs (species 1/(species 1 + species 2)) suitable for testing PMF results using EMMA. EMMA was based on determining whether most samples in mixing diagrams that use DR values as coordinates of source points could be bound by a geometrical shape whose vertices are pollution sources. It was found that the four PAH sources and four IE sources obtained using PMF were also identified using EMMA. Thus, the validity of the most of PMF-derived source profiles was proved.

Seiche- and storm-driven benthic oxygen uptake in a eutrophic freshwater bay determined with aquatic eddy covariance	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Oxygen depletion in bottom waters of lakes and coastal regions is expanding worldwide. To examine the causes of hypoxia, we quantified the drivers of benthic oxygen uptake in Green Bay, Lake Michigan, USA, using 2 techniques, aquatic eddy covariance and sediment core incubation. We investigated benthic oxygen uptake along a gradient in C deposition, including shallow water near the riverine source of eutrophication and deeper waters of lower Green Bay where high net sediment deposition occurs. Time-averaged eddy covariance oxygen uptake was high near the source of eutrophication (11.5 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) and at the shallower of the high deposition sites (9.8 mmol m(-2) d(-1)). The eddy covariance technique revealed a decrease in benthic oxygen uptake with depth at the high deposition sites. These patterns were consistent with benthic uptake being driven by the deposition of autochthonous production. Additionally, eddy covariance revealed a nearly proportional relationship between benthic oxygen uptake and current velocity at all sites. Specifically, because of the lake seiche, water velocity typically varied 3x at a site and caused a 3x variation in benthic oxygen uptake. A summer storm also doubled bottom-water velocities and caused a further doubling of uptake to 28 mmol m(-2) d(-1). This high sensitivity of benthic oxygen uptake to seiche-driven water velocities indicates that redox conditions in surficial cohesive sediments are highly dynamic.

We used non-destructive methods to measure the low-field magnetic susceptibility shortly after sampling, and anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM) was assessed in 2012 and 2015. The ARM acquisition and demagnetization curves from littoral sites showed several patterns that reflect the provenance of the sediments. At water depths below 10 m, the magnetic susceptibility and ARM of greenish black mud with high organic content decreased considerably with the increase in water depth, but ARM increased slightly at water depths greater than 16 m. We also found that the magnetic concentrations of mud samples were reduced markedly during a period of storage for about 3 years. We attributed these reductions to diagenetic loss of magnetic minerals, which had been enhanced at deeper sites. It is possible that the ARM carriers in deeper areas were derived from authigenic formation of iron sulfide or from deposition of suspended matter in the hypolimnion water. We propose that the magnetic properties of surficial sediments are controlled by limnological stratification of the brackish lake water, thus possibly providing an analog for down-core variations of magnetic parameters associated with the modification of magnetic minerals during reductive diagenesis.					; Yonenobu, Hitoshi/AAB-1500-2021	Hayashida, Akira/0000-0003-4492-5622; Yonenobu, Hitoshi/0000-0002-1596-7543													1880-5981					OCT 23	2015	67								171	10.1186/s40623-015-0343-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40623-015-0343-7													WOS:000363371200001

Acidity levels were increased from background values of pH 6.9 to 5.0, 4.5, and 4.0 to simulate snowmelt and rainstorm events observed in south-central Ontario. Conductivity and concentrations of Ca and Mn increased significantly for all three pH disturbances. Fe and dissolved organic C remained unchanged at pH 4.5 and 4.0 but Fe increased at pH 5.0 Total and inorganic monomeric Al increased at pH 4.5 and 4.0 relative to reference areas. At pH 5.0, density decreases were observed for Baetis, Ectemnia, Simulium, and Prosimulium, at pH 4.5 for Baetis, Lepidostoma, Micropsectra, Simulium, and Prosimulium, and at pH 4.0 for Baetis, Tanytarsus, and Cricotopus. Densities of collectod/filterers and clingers decreased at all pH levels, but diversity decreased in the experimental reach at pH 4.0 only. Drift density of the above genera was correlated with H+ concentration. Large reductions in macroinvertebrate densities occurred at higher pH (5.0) and during shorter exposure times compared with previous experiments in areas of higher H+ deposition in southcentral Ontario and New Hampshire.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				AUG	1994	51	8					1877	1892		10.1139/f94-188	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f94-188													WOS:A1994PW57100021
J	DESGRANGES, JL; DARVEAU, M				DESGRANGES, JL; DARVEAU, M			EFFECT OF LAKE ACIDITY AND MORPHOMETRY ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF AQUATIC BIRDS IN SOUTHERN QUEBEC	HOLARCTIC ECOLOGY												More than half the lakes in the deciduous and boreal forest regions of southern Quebec harbour at least one aquatic bird species during the nesting period. Although the number of nesting pairs per lake is generally small, those pairs are most commonly seen on lakes with a surface area of more than 15 ha, a winter pH lower than that of normal rain (i.e. < 5.6), an irregular shore configuration marked by abundant riparian vegetation, and islands. In a correspondence analysis, the first axis, representing lake acidity, explains 68% of the total variance. The common goldeneye Bucephala clangula, which is frequently seen on the most acidic lakes, and the American black duck Anas rubripes, which tends to avoid acidic lakes, show the largest contributions to that axis. The second axis describes an altitude/surface area gradient and brings the cumulative percentage of explained total variance to 94%; the great blue heron Ardea herodias and the common loon Gavia immer primarily use large, low-altitude lakes, whereas the ringnecked duck Aythya collaris and the American black duck are often found on the smaller, higher-altitude lakes. Those results are discussed as they relate to the feeding requirements of the various species of bird and the biology of their main prey. The ecological segregation of the three waterfowl species is attributed to interspecific competition.																			0105-9327						1985	8	3					181	190																WOS:A1985ATW5800003

This study was carried out to identify existing source areas for known and previously unrecognized toxic substances. Our strategy was to analyze those resident fish with the highest likely levels of contaminants. All fish analyzed (eight species from southern Michigan to the upper peninsula) exceeded the 2 mg/kg FDA action levels for PCBs, while 50% of the samples exceeded the DDTr IJC objective of 1 mg/kg. St. Joseph River common carp (Cyprinus carpio) carried the heaviest contaminant burden of all fish examined for PCBs (27.6 mg/kg), DDTr (10.2 kg/mg), and toxaphene (3.3 mg/kg); chlordane levels (0.85 mg/kg) were second highest to those in Kalamazoo River common carp (0.87 mg/kg). Concentrations of PCBs, toxaphene, DDT, DDE, and other pesticides were higher in bottom-feeding fish, such as common carp, than in top predators, e.g., northern pike (Esox lucius). Bottom feeders are relatively fatty fish, and live and feed near contaminated sediments, which increases their potential to bioaccumulate fat-soluble contaminants. Pesticides were also present in elevated concentrations in fish from sites with higher industrial and agricultural development.																			0380-1330						1987	13	3					296	309		10.1016/S0380-1330(87)71653-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(87)71653-0													WOS:A1987K547400008

The main purpose was to study whether there were differences suggesting spectral adaptation of rod vision to different photic environments during the short history (< 10(4) years) of postglacial isolation of the Baltic Sea and the Finnish lakes. Rod absorbance spectra of the Baltic subspecies /populations of herring (Clupea harengus membras), flounder (Platichthys flesus), and sand goby (Poinatoschistus minutus) were all long-wavelength-shifted (9.8, 1.9, and 5.3 nm, respectively, at the wavelength of maximum absorbance, A,,,) compared with their truly marine counterparts, consistent with adaptation for improved quantum catch, and improved signal-to-noise ratio of vision in the Baltic light environment. Judged by the shape of the spectra, the chromophore was pure A I in all these cases; hence the differences indicate evolutionary tuning of the opsin. In no species of fresh-water origin did we find significant opsin-based spectral shifts specific to the Baltic populations, only spectral differences due to varying A1/A2 chromophore ratio in some. For most species, rod Am fell within a wavelength range consistent with high signal-to-noise ratio of vision in the spectral conditions prevailing at depths where light becomes scarce in the respective waters. Exceptions were sandeels in the Baltic Sea, which are active only in bright light, and all species in a "brown" lake, where rod lambda(max) lay far below the theoretically optimal range.

Carbon fixation rates have not previously been published for Lake Winnipeg but are important for quantifying the lake's role in the regional greenhouse gas budget and the lake's trophic structure and fish habitat. This study measured net ecosystem production (NEP), gross primary production (GPP), and gross respiration (GR) across the lake using a custom-built automated incubator connected to a ship's water intake during a research cruise between July 31 and August 17, 2018 on Lake Winnipeg. The incubator estimated NEP, GR, and GPP every 60 min while moving along the ship's track and at anchor, providing high-resolution data that are not obtainable through conventional incubations. The mean NEP for Lake Winnipeg during our survey was -8.4 +/- 5.6 g C m(-2) d(-1), suggesting that the lake was net heterotrophic and thus a net CO2 source to the atmosphere during the 2018 summer cruise. The high-resolution data revealed significant spatiotemporal variability, including short-lived, highly net productive events that preceded remotely sensed chlorophyll a blooms by several days. Conversely, in regions with high chlorophyll a concentrations, we observed strong net heterotrophy and low nutrients, suggesting respiration was fueled by the degradation of mature, nutrient-limited phytoplankton blooms. The incubator system used in this study demonstrated its utility for monitoring rapid changes in NEP over short spatial scales in a lake which shows heightened regional variability in its physical, biogeochemical, and biological make-up.

J	Biedka, P				Biedka, Pawel			The Effect of Changes in the Thermal Stratification Time on the Eutrophication Processes in Lakes	ROCZNIK OCHRONA SRODOWISKA												In this study, the effect of changes in the thermal stratification time of lakes on the eutrophication processes was determined. The study included four lakes of Suwalsko-Augustowskie Lake District, i.e. Necko, Rospuda Augustowska, Biale Augustowskie i Studzieniczne, which are localized in north-eastern Poland. In investigation the model of lakes eutrophication, defined in the WASP (Water Analysis Simulation Program) and developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) was used. Model was developed for the one-year period from 1 May 2006 till 30 April 2007, on the second level of complexity of the eutrophication process in EUTRO module. This allows the prediction of the concentration of: ammonia nitrogen, nitrate (V) nitrogen, organic nitrogen as well as phosphate phosphorus (V), the organic phosphorus concentration, dissolved oxygen, carbon biochemical oxygen demand and chlorophyll a. Then, the model was used to simulate taking into account the changes of factors, which determine the quality of water and processes progress associated with eutrophication. This paper presents the results of prognoses taking into account the extention and shortening the time of thermal stratification in analyzed lakes by one month. Simulations started up at the beginning of the spring season. It was assumed that stratification occurs one month earlier or later in comparison to thermal conditions observed in 2006 and 2007. The simulation indicates that, in some cases, small changes in the time of stratification may result in noticeable change in the value of water quality indicators connected with eutrophication. In eutrophic lakes, ex end or shortening period in which the hypolimnion water are deoxygenated is directly related to the intensity of the internal nutrients loads. In this case, the extend the period by one month caused the increase of maximal forecasted annual chlorophyll a concentration (in the Biale Augustowskie Lake by 17%). The increase of concentration nitrogen and phosphorus components was also noted. In the lakes, in which the main nutrient source are inflows (for example Rospuda Augustowska and Necko) the length of period with the limnetic layers has a less impact on mentioned indicators.																			1506-218X						2014	16		1				470	485																WOS:000347739400030
J	ARMITAGE, KB; HOUSE, HB				ARMITAGE, KB; HOUSE, HB			A LIMNOLOGICAL RECONNAISSANCE IN THE AREA OF MCMURDO SOUND, ANTARCTICA	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												During the Antarctic summer of 1960-61, limnological data were collected from a series of meltwater ponds and permanently ice-covered lakes in the area of McMurdo Sound, Antarctica (77[degree]51'' S, 166[degree]37'' E). All ponds were basic and more saline than typical freshwater lakes. Primary productions, measured in two ponds by the "light and dark bottle" technique, varied from 326 to 1008 mgC/m3/day. High intensity of light inhibited photosynthesis in shallow water. Lake Bonney in Taylor Dry Valley and Lake Vanda in Wright Valley lie in a large ice-free area in South Victoria Land on the west side of McMurdo Sound. Each lake is covered with 3.4-4.2 m of permanent ice and is meromictic. The mixolimnion of Lake Bonney varied from 0.3[degree]-8[degree]C; the monomolimnion was below 0[degree]C. The mixolimnion of Lake Vanda varied from 0.7[degree]-9.6[degree]C; the monomolimnion was warmed to 22[degree]C. The lakes are probably warmed geothermally. No zooplankton was found in any of the lakes, but 7 genera of Ciliata, 4 of Rotifera, and one each of Nematoda, Turbellaria, and Tardigrada were collected from the littoral fauna of the meltwater ponds and around the edges of Lakes Bonney and Vanda.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1962	7	1					36	41		10.4319/lo.1962.7.1.0036	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1962.7.1.0036													WOS:A1962WU64900006

AN APPROACH FOR COLLECTION OF NEARFIELD GROUNDWATER SAMPLES IN SUBMERGED LIMESTONE CAVERNS	ACTA CARSOLOGICA												Walls of submerged caves feeding Florida springs are often lined with a heavy mat of filamentous bacteria, many of which are able to oxidize reduced sulfur in groundwater migrating from the porous bedrock into the cave conduit. To determine changes in water chemistry as water passes through the microbial mat, a simple device made from standard well screen and sealed with a rubber stopper and controllable vents was installed in a hole drilled in the wall of the cave passage. The sampler was sealed in place with marine epoxy. We measured anions in water from the sampler and from the water-filled conduit taken just outside the sampler. Most anions measured viz., Cl-, NO3-, and PO43-, increased slightly between the matrix and conduit waters. However, traces of sulfide were measured in the water from the rock matrix, but not in the conduit. SO42- concentrations in the conduit were about twice that measured in the water from the sampler, about 22 and 11 mg SO42- L-1, respectively, providing further evidence that sulfur oxidation is an important process in the bacterial mats attached to the limestone surfaces in these caves. An additional use of the sampling device is to measure discharge from the local bedrock into the cave conduit.

A 350 ka record of climate change from Lake El'gygytgyn, Far East Russian Arctic: refining the pattern of climate modes by means of cluster analysis	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												Rock magnetic, biochemical and inorganic records of the sediment cores PG1351 and Lz1024 from Lake El'gygytgyn, Chukotka peninsula, Far East Russian Arctic, were subject to a hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis in order to refine and extend the pattern of climate modes as defined by Melles et al. (2007). Cluster analysis of the data obtained from both cores yielded similar results, differentiating clearly between the four climate modes warm, peak warm, cold and dry, and cold and moist. In addition, two transitional phases were identified, representing the early stages of a cold phase and slightly colder conditions during a warm phase. The statistical approach can thus be used to resolve gradual changes in the sedimentary units as an indicator of available oxygen in the hypolimnion in greater detail. Based upon cluster analyses on core Lz1024, the published succession of climate modes in core PG1351, covering the last 250 ka, was modified and extended back to 350 ka. Comparison to the marine oxygen isotope (delta O-18) stack LR04 (Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005) and the summer insolation at 67.5 degrees N, with the extended Lake El'gygytgyn parameter records of magnetic susceptibility (kappa(LF)), total organic carbon content (TOC) and the chemical index of alteration (CIA; Minyuk et al., 2007), revealed that all stages back to marine isotope stage (MIS) 10 and most of the substages are clearly reflected in the pattern derived from the cluster analysis.

Feeding of Arapaima sp.: integrating stomach contents and local ecological knowledge	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The giant arapaima (Arapaima sp.) has been described as a fish of change in Amazonia because of its important role in the conservation of floodplains, food security and income generation for rural communities. Nonetheless, despite the cultural, ecological and economic importance of arapaima, data on diet are scarce. Aiming to expand knowledge about arapaima diet in western Amazonia, scientific knowledge was integrated with the knowledge of local dwellers. During the low-water period (September 2018) and the falling-water period (June 2019), arapaima stomachs were collected from 11 floodplain lakes in the middle Jurua River. All fishes were measured [TL (total length)] and sexed. Food items from each stomach were categorized as fishes, invertebrates, plants and bone remains and weighed. Also, in the latter period, experienced local fishers were interviewed about arapaima feeding. This integrated approach revealed that young arapaima eat fish and invertebrates but adult arapaima eat fish of a wide range of species, which were mainly of low and intermediate trophic positions. This study reports the first case of cannibalism for arapaima and also shows that during the low-water period, many individuals had empty stomachs or only some small fish-bone remains and/or plant material. Arapaima sex and TL had no influence on the absence of prey in stomach contents. Overall, it can be concluded that local people had consistent ethnobiological knowledge of arapaima feeding ecology that could be useful within management projects in the region.					; Magnusson, William/J-9408-2014; Campos-Silva, Joao/S-4487-2019; Jardine, Timothy/AFZ-4837-2022; Jacobi, Cristina/AGX-0389-2022; Villamarín, Francisco/D-8765-2013	Magnusson, William/0000-0003-1988-3950; campos e silva, joao vitor/0000-0003-4998-7216; Jacobi, Cristina Mariana/0000-0001-5660-7934; 													0022-1112	1095-8649				JUL	2020	97	1					265	272		10.1111/jfb.14372	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfb.14372		JUN 2020						32383478					WOS:000536951900001
J	Kwarteng, AY				Kwarteng, AY			Multitemporal remote sensing data analysis of Kuwait's oil lakes	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL												Digital image processing techniques were applied to Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data acquired between 1987 and 1995 to map the oil lakes, tarmats, and soot in the Greater Burgan oil field, Kuwait. The oil lakes were created during the 1991 Arabian Gulf War when several producing oil wells in Kuwait were set ablaze and others damaged to allow oil to gush uncontrollably. The images were subjected to a large high-pass filter with 50% addback of the original image. The filtered results were then edge enhanced to sharpen the local textural information. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was used to map the vegetation distribution in the TM data acquired in the spring. The TM imagery analysis indicated that a majority of the contaminated areas surrounding the oil lakes were gradually recovering in terms of vegetation growth. The surficial coverage of the oil lakes calculated from the 1995 TM digital image data was 38.93 km(2). Of their total, 35.45 km(2), or over 90% of the oil lakes were in the Greater Burgan oil field. The 20% decrease in the original total area was due to the shrinkage in volume and area from the recovery process, sand encroachment, and the drying of shallow parts with time. Even though some of the oil lake beds are covered by a veneer of sand and are not seen on satellite images, they still pose hazards to the environment.

Modelling CO2 dispersion in the air during potential limnic eruption at the lake Pavin (France)	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												Risk mitigation in long-dormant volcanic provinces is a challenge due to the absence of collective memory of past disasters as well as the scarcity, and subtlety, of unrest signals that can be monitored. In this study, the impact of a potential limnic eruption is assessed at the 92-m-deep lake Pavin (French Massif Central). The lake is hosted in a maar crater formed during the last eruptive event in metropolitan France (similar to 7 ka) and contains dissolved CO2 in the deepest water layer, below 60 m. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions measured at the lake surface (0.44 km(2)) reach up to 10.1 tons/day during the winter. Beyond this (limited) continuous degassing of the lake, the current CO2 budget in the monimolimnion layer (at a depth of 60 m to 92 m) was estimated at 1750 tons, of which about 450 tons are available for release in case of overturn of the lake. Scenarios for CO2 dispersion in the lower atmosphere were simulated with the DISGAS and TWODEE-2 models by varying (i) meteorological conditions, (ii) the amount of CO2 released, (iii) and the mechanisms of degassing during a potential limnic eruption. The simulations allowed identification and delimitation of areas potentially impacted by hazardous CO2 levels in the air down-valley from the lake and directly around the lake. The spatio-temporal evolution of the potential CO2 cloud raises issues regarding the impacts of such a hypothetical event in the close vicinity of the lake and, given the area is populated and highly visited, needs to be considered in future risk mitigation strategies.

M.			Last Glacial Maximum environmental conditions at Andoya, northern Norway; evidence for a northern ice-edge ecological "hotspot"	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Andoya on the NW coast of Norway is a key site for understanding the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) in northern Europe. Controversy has arisen concerning the local conditions, especially about the timing and extent of local glacial cover, maximum July temperatures and whether pine and/or spruce could have grown there. We reviewed all existing data and add newly analysed ancient sedimentary DNA (sedaDNA), pollen, macrofossils, geochemistry and stable isotopes from three lake sediment cores from Ovre AErasvatnet. A total of 23 new dates and age-depth modelling suggests the lake has been ice-free since GI2 (<23.4 cal ka BP) and possibly GS3 (<26.7 cal ka BP). Pinus and Picea sedaDNA was found in all three cores but at such low frequencies that it could not be distinguished from background contamination. LGM samples have an exceptionally high organic matter content, with isotopic values indicating that carbon and nitrogen derive from a marine source. Along with finds of bones of the little auk (Alle alle), this indicates that the lake received guano from an adjacent bird colony. SedaDNA, pollen and macrofossil assemblages were dominated by Poaceae, Brassicaceae and Papaver, but scattered occurrence of species currently restricted to the Low Arctic Tundra Zone (July temperature of 8-9 degrees C) such as Apiaceae (sedaDNA, 8-9 degrees C), and Alchemilla alpina (macrofossil, 8-9 degrees C) were also recorded. The review of >14.7 cal ka BP data recorded 94 vascular plant taxa, of which 38% have a northern limit in Shrub Tundra or more southern vegetation zones. This unusual assemblage likely stems from a combination of proximity to ice-free water in summer, geographical isolation linked with stochastic long-distance dispersal events, and the presence of bird-fertilized habitats. The environmental reconstruction based on all records from the area does not preclude local growth of tree species, as the local climate combined with high nutrient input may have led to periodically suitable environmental 'hotspot' conditions.

J	FulfordSmith, SP; Sikes, EL				FulfordSmith, SP; Sikes, EL			The evolution of Ace Lake, Antarctica, determined from sedimentary diatom assemblages	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The sediments in Ace Lake in the Vestfold Hills, East Antarctica, contain a continuous sequence of diatom frustules that record the lake's history since its formation during the retreat of continental ice more than 9200 years ago. Frustules from six indicator groups; Pinnularia microstauron, Nitzschia cylindrus, Nitzschia curta, Eucampia antarctica, a freshwater Stauroneis species and several centric species in a sediment core were used to determine the sequence of the lake's evolution. The history of the lake falls into five stages. Ace Lake began as a marine inlet influenced by dynamic mixing of ocean and meltwater inputs. As the ice sheet retreated, isostatic uplift isolated the lake allowing it to be flushed by meltwater input from the retreating ice sheet. Over the course of 800 years (similar to 9200-8400 C-14 yr B.P.) the lake became meromictic supporting a freshwater diatom assemblage. Approximately 6700 years ago, coinciding with Antarctic sea level maxima, diatom assemblages indicate that seawater flooded over the sill into Ace Lake disturbing the freshwater meromixis. The sediments in this period were laminated and contained elemental sulphur suggesting that the marine input was limited in extent and energy. Approximately 5500 years ago this marine input ceased and the lake again became a meromictic basin which stabilised over 1700 years to become the lake that it is today and has been with little change for about the past 4000 years.																			0031-0182					AUG	1996	124	1-2					73	86		10.1016/0031-0182(96)01657-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0031-0182(96)01657-4													WOS:A1996VB57900005

Blooms of Microcystis, a toxin-producing blue-green alga, became re-established in the bay after the zebra mussel invasion. Microcystis blooms had all but been eliminated in the early 1980s with controls on external phosphorus loadings, but have re-occurred in the bay most summers since 1992. An apparent paradox is that these recent Microcystis blooms have not been accompanied by increases in external phosphorus loadings. An ecosystem model was used to investigate whether the re-occurrence of Microcystis could be due to changes caused by zebra mussels that impacted phytoplankton community structure and/or internal phosphorus dynamics. The model was first used to establish baseline conditions in Saginaw Bay for 1991, before zebra mussels significantly impacted the system. The baseline model was then used to investigate: (1) the composite impacts of zebra mussels with average 1991-1995 densities; (2) sensitivity to changes in zebra mussel densities and external phosphorus loadings; and (3) three hypotheses on potential causative factors for proliferation of blue-green algae. Under the model assumptions, selective rejection of blue-green algae by zebra mussels appears to be a necessary factor in the enhancement of blue-green production in the presence of zebra mussels. Enhancement also appears to depend on the increased sediment-water phosphorus flux associated with the presence of zebra mussels, the magnitude of zebra mussel densities, and the distribution of zebra mussel densities among different age groups.																			0380-1330						2005	31	1					32	55		10.1016/S0380-1330(05)70236-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(05)70236-7													WOS:000230145500004

Berenike caves, Israel	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPELEOLOGY												The Berenike hypogenic cave system near Lake Kinneret, Israel, provides a valuable case study for investigating the recently proposed Confined-Cooling-Flow (CCF) speleogenesis model. Field and speleological surveys, along with existing research, are used to provide a thorough analysis. The CCF model relies on a simple thermo-hydro-chemical scenario, involving the rise of CO2-rich hydrothermal fluids discharging into a confined layer. The cooling of these CO2-rich fluids turns them into aggressive solutions due to the inverse relation between temperature and solubility of carbonates (retrograde solubility). Previous geochemical and numerical analyses of the CCF model predict localized and persistent dissolution and speleogenesis on short geologic timescales and reproduce common characteristics of hypogene cave morphology. The present study examines speleogenesis in Berenike by correlating it spatially and temporally with the geologic history and hydrogeology of the region and refers to the cave location and appearance in the rock section. The relatively clear and preserved morphologic features at various scales allow for further insights. Particularly, the CCF model can explain enigmatic field observations, such as the location of the largest passages at some distance away from the feeder. It also accounts for the formation of intricate maze-like networks in soluble rock successions and confined conditions, not explained by other models. Finally, this study suggests that the CCF model has broader applicability in understanding the formation of numerous large hypogenic karst and maze cave systems that are globally widespread.					; Roded, Roi/KLE-3789-2024; Frumkin, Amos/AGN-6695-2022; Szymczak, Piotr/A-9268-2008	Ullman, Micka/0000-0003-3485-5974; 													0392-6672	1827-806X				JUN	2024	53	2					191	209		10.5038/1827-806X.53.2.2505	http://dx.doi.org/10.5038/1827-806X.53.2.2505													WOS:001308049700008

The present study investigated the concentrations of F-, NO3-, and metal elements like Hg, Mn, As, and Pb in the groundwater resources and their health risk assessment on the west margin of Urmia Lake, Iran. Sampling points were selected and taken from 121 groundwater resources in the summer of 2014. Heavy metals (Pb, As, Mn, and Hg) were measured by ICP-OES (inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer, model: Arcos, Germany), and some ions (Na+, NO3-, F-, and Cl-) by flame photometer and spectrophotometer according to the standard methods, respectively. The nitrate concentration range in groundwater samples measured from 1.7 to 137 mg/L and fluoride from 0.4 to 4.5 mg/L. The probabilistic method and Monte Carlo simulation were used to estimate carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic risks. The concentration of study elements in most samples was obtained in the WHO (World Health Organization) recommended range. The order of HM (heavy metal) concentration is based on the overall mean: Mn > As > Hg > Pb. The HI (hazard index ) level was found to be more than 1 for noncarcinogenic risk for As and NO3- and permissible risks for the other elements and fluoride. ELCR (excess lifetime cancer risk) levels of As were acceptable, except for some sampling points, the central region in the study area, near the seashore of Urmia Lake. Finally, it can be stated that the groundwater resources in the studied area are acceptable for drinking in most places. Still, due to the effects of As and NO3- contaminated water, the quality is unacceptable for drinking in some places. So, monitoring water quality is recommended by finding contamination sources to decrease the health risks of drinking consumption.

Ecological conditions affect behavioral and morphological trait variability of lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens Rafinesque, 1817) yolk-sac larvae	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY					5th Annual Meeting of the North-American-Sturgeon-and-Paddlefish-Society (NASPS)	SEP 19-22, 2016	Hood River, OR	N Amer Sturgeon & Paddlefish Soc				The effects of stream environmental conditions on inter individual variability were quantified for lake sturgeon, Acipenser fulvescens (Rafinesque, 1817) yolk sac larvae in the expression of behavioral and morphological traits. Simulated experimental treatments including food availability (brine shrimp), presence of chemosensory predator cues (adult crayfish and odonate larvae), and conspecific density (2 verses 1 larvae) were applied to determine the effects on the duration of time in substrates following hatch and growth from hatch until emergence. In spring 2010, larvae from two full-sib families were individually placed into 240 mL perforated plastic containers (n = 263) with gravel substrate immediately following hatch. Containers were maintained in stream water at ambient temperatures and constant flow (similar to 0.03 m/sec) in 4 m experimental flowing streams. Duration of time (days) each individual remained in the substrate was recorded. Morphological traits including total length (mm), body area (mm(2)), and yolk-sac area (mm(2)) were measured at hatch and at the time of emergence from substrate to compare growth and amount of endogenous yolk reserves used in individuals among experimental treatments. Environmental conditions significantly affected emergence time. Individuals emerged earlier in treatments exposing larvae to chemosensory predator odorants and higher conspecific density. Use of endogenous reserves (yolk-sac area) at the time of emergence did not differ among treatments. Growth was significantly greater when individuals were provided a food source compared to all other treatments. Quantifying the magnitude and direction of phenotypic responses to environmental conditions is important to understand potential factors affecting survival during early life stages and population viability under conditions of increasing environmental variability.

The lake is situated 569 m above sea level, its surface area is 48 ha and maximum depth 10 m. The fish fauna consists of perch, roach (Rutilus rutilus L.), pike (Esox lucius L.) and sparse populations of brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) and burbot (Lota lota L.). The water quality was poor due to acidification, with a pH level of about 5.0 until the summer of 1991 when 23 tonnes of limestone powder were added. Afterwards, pH > 6.0 was maintained, except for snowmelt periods when the pH dropped to 5.8. Liming was expected to improve recruitment, and to avoid overcrowding and stunting, the most numerous species, perch and roach, have been heavily fished with traps and gillnets annually since 1992. Density of the perch population was determined with the mark recapture experiment, and biomass and production in the period 1992-1994 were simulated by modelling. Biomass of perch was estimated to 9.5 kg/ha before the mass removal and to 2.8 kg/ha afterwards. The biomass reduction led to increased growth rate, and based on the model, 1-1.5 kg/ha of perch with a mean weight of 100 g may be caught annually.																			0003-455X	1797-2450					1996	33	3-4					427	435																WOS:A1996WB44500018
S	Mezosi, G	Mezosi, G			Mezosi, Gabor	Mezosi, G		Physical Geography of the Transdanubian Mountains	PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY OF HUNGARY	Geography of the Physical Environment											The Transdanubian Mountains mainly consist of Mesozoic carbonate sedimentary blocks, but young volcanic elements also appear in the region. The main character of the macro-region is determined by limestone and dolomite covered by younger sediments, as they influence the rate of (weak) karstification and the type of vegetation, which is also influenced by elevation and lithological changes. The main natural resource of the area is bauxite with declining exploitation, manganese and brown coal with already closed mines. Nowadays, they rather constitute a reserve. The mining activity already terminated, but it caused very complex environmental problems, and the relaxation period of the landscape is very long, as the extreme lowering of the karst water table caused several problems. The most well-known consequence of the mining was the limited utilisation of Heviz Lake, as the discharge of the hot springs supplying the lake decreased dramatically. The problem of decreasing water supply appeared in several lakes, as karst water withdrawal was very intensive during the mining. Probably, the regeneration and relaxation of the hydrological system will last for decades after the termination of mining. In the eastern and north-eastern meso-regions, the greatest problems are in connection with dense urbanisation (region of Budapest) and with intensive industrial activity along the Danube in the northern foreland of the Gerecse Mts. (e.g. at Almasfuzito).																			2366-8865	2366-8873	978-3-319-45183-1; 978-3-319-45182-4				2017							255	267		10.1007/978-3-319-45183-1_10	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-45183-1_10	10.1007/978-3-319-45183-1												WOS:000411285100011

Deep dynamic pools of phosphorus in the sediment of a temperate lagoon with recurring blooms of diazotrophic cyanobacteria	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The storage and release of phosphorus by sediments can act as an important control on the formation of noxious blooms of cyanobacteria in lakes and estuaries. Here we studied the uptake and release of phosphorus associated with iron oxides within sediments of a lagoon system affected by recurring summer blooms of the cyanobacterium Nodularia spumigena. Using an ascorbate extraction, we observed deep pools of iron oxide associated phosphorus (P) at concentrations of approximate to 5 mol g(-1) dry sed to a depth of approximate to 20 cm. This pool rapidly decreased with the onset of water column anoxia, leading to an integrated release of approximate to 300 mmol of phosphorus m(-2) of sediment over 3.5 months. Scaling this flux over the periodically anoxic area of the lake and over the period of an N. spumigena bloom (November-December 2011) gave a broad mass balance agreement with the increase in total phosphorus within the water column and exported from the lagoon. Over this period we estimated that P release from the sediment would have allowed approximate to 130-187 tonnes of nitrogen to be fixed which agrees with previous estimates of nitrogen fixation. Upon reoxygenation of the water column, a regeneration of the deep iron oxide associated phosphorus pool was observed. This deep dynamic pool of phosphorus was most likely mediated by the burrowing activity of the polychaete Capitella capitata which was observed at the study site. This study underscores the potential importance of sediments colonized by deeply irrigating fauna to become a significant source of phosphorus during water column anoxia.					; Woodland, Ryan/D-5344-2017; Grace, Mike/AAE-3376-2021; Cook, Perran/D-2574-2010	Cook, Perran/0000-0002-0444-3488; Grace, Mike/0000-0002-0982-8133; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	2015	60	6					2185	2196		10.1002/lno.10162	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.10162													WOS:000363888400024
J	Lachance, S				Lachance, S			Report on the situation of the Redfin Pickerel, Esox americanus americanus, in Canada	CANADIAN FIELD-NATURALIST												In Canada, the Redfin Pickerel (Esox americanus americanus), is restricted to Quebec. The first Canadian record of Redfin Pickerel dates back to 1944. Its distribution is limited to the St. Lawrence River, between the Vercheres Islands and the mouth of the Godefroy River; Lake St. Paul; and the drainages of the Richelieu River, including Lake Champlain, the St. Franqois River and the Yamaska River. The abundance of the Redfin Pickerel is difficult to assess because it is able to escape from several types of gear commonly used in fish surveys. Further, it prefers shallow grass beds, in which intensive inventories are seldom conducted. The only well-established populations seem to be those of the Upper Richelieu River and the Berthier Islands, where its abundance is stable. The primary threats to the survival of the Redfin Pickerel are believed to be dyke construction on farmland to prevent spring flooding and the drainage of grass beds. This subspecies has not been given any special protective status and is not the subject of specific regulations. There are, however, a few protected areas within its range, and the Quebec Act on the Conservation and Development of Wildlife protects fish habitat located on public land. The Redfin Pickerel has no commercial value.																			0008-3550					OCT-DEC	2001	115	4					597	607																WOS:000177497000009
J	Sommer, B; Horwitz, P				Sommer, Bea; Horwitz, Pierre			Macroinvertebrate cycles of decline and recovery in Swan Coastal Plain (Western Australia) wetlands affected by drought-induced acidification	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Management of wetlands influenced by the Gnangara groundwater mound, Western Australia, is becoming increasingly challenging due to an ongoing decline in the regional groundwater table. A number of these groundwater-dependent wetlands have acidified (with adverse effects on the extant macroinvertebrate fauna) due to the oxidation of pyritic sediments. One management option in such cases is artificial augmentation of surface water in order to maintain or reinstate anaerobia in the sediments. This paper documents cycles of macroinvertebrate decline and recovery over 12 years of monitoring in three Gnangara mound wetlands affected by drought-induced acidification, one of which is being artificially augmented. Acidification did not result in a reduction of the total number of macroinvertebrate families present, however, there were clearly identifiable groups of acid-sensitive taxa (amphipods and isopods, ostracods, chydorid and daphnid cladocerans, mayflies, oligochaetes, clams and snails) and acid-tolerant taxa (sandfly larvae, macrothricid cladocerans and water boatmen). In the artificially augmented wetland, the effects of acidification were reversed: acid-sensitive taxa reappeared and acid-tolerant taxa decreased in numbers. Moreover, there were a number of taxa that appeared for the first time since augmentation, and summer family richness increased markedly. This study has shown that artificial augmentation of wetland water levels can be a successful recovery strategy for recently acidified systems, but this will depend on a number of factors, and the 'recovered' state will be at least slightly different from the original state.

Despite its numerous advantages over culture-based monitoring approaches, qPCR monitoring has yet to become widely used in the US or elsewhere. Considering qPCR results obtained on a given day as the best available measure of that day's water quality, we evaluated the frequency of correct vs. incorrect beach management decisions that are driven by culture testing. Methods: Beaches in Chicago, USA, were monitored using E. coli culture and enterococci qPCR methods over 894 beach-days in the summers of 2015 and 2016. Agreement in beach management using the two methods, after taking into account agreement due to chance, was summarized using Cohen's kappa statistic. Results: No meaningful agreement (beyond that expected by chance) was observed between beach management actions driven by the two pieces of information available to beach managers on a given day: enterococci qPCR results ofsamples collected that morning and E. coli culture results of samples collected the previous day. The E. coli culture beach action value was exceeded 3.4 times more frequently than the enterococci qPCR beach action value (22.6 vs. 6.6% of beach-days). Conclusions: The largest evaluation of qPCR-based beach monitoring to date provides little scientific rationale for continued E. coli culture testing of beach water in our setting. The observation that the E. coli culture beach action value was exceeded three times as frequently as the enterococci qPCR beach action value suggests that, although the beach action values for bacteria using different measurement methods are thought to provide comparable information about health risk, this does not appear to be the case in all settings.

We measured concentrations of methyl mercury (MeHg) and essential fatty acids (EFAs, key nutrients for aquatic food webs) in four size categories of planktonic organisms - seston (10-64 mu m), micro-(100-200 mu m), meso-(200-500 mu m), and macrozooplankton (> 500 mu m) - as well as total mercury (THg) and EFAs in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in coastal lakes. We demonstrate that, in all lakes during this summer sampling, MeHg concentrations of planktonic organisms increase significantly with plankton size, independent of their taxonomic composition, and that their MeHg accumulation patterns predict significantly THg concentrations in rainbow trout (R-2 =0.71, p < 0.05). However, concentrations of total EFAs do not follow this pattern. Total EFAs increased from seston to mesozooplankton but decreased in the largest zooplankton size fraction. Moreover, concentrations of individual EFA compounds in rainbow trout are consistently lower, with the exception of docosahexaenoic acid, than those in macrozooplankton. The continuous increase of MeHg concentrations in aquatic organisms, therefore, differs from patterns of EFA accumulation in zooplankton and fish. We interpret these contrasting accumulation patterns of MeHg and EFA compounds as the inability of aquatic organisms to regulate the assimilation of dietary MeHg, whereas the rate of EFA retention may be controlled to optimize their physiological performance. Therefore, we conclude that bioaccumulation patterns of Hg in these aquatic food webs are not controlled by lipid solubility and/or the retention of EFA compounds. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Taste and odor events resulted in widespread public reaction to the earthy/musty tasting water produced and a need for accurate information to assist water treatment efforts. The presence of geosmin, (trans, trans - 1,10-dimethyl-9-decalol) and 2-methylisoborneol (MIB2, 1, 2, 7,7-tetramethyl-exo-bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-ol), the most common causes worldwide of earthy and musty odors in water were investigated in eastern Lake Ontario and the upper Sr. Lawrence River. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used for quantitation and confirmation of the presence of these compounds in water samples. Both geosmin and MIB2 were detected in river water samples at concentrations ranging from 5 to 20 ng/L and 2 to25 ng/L, respectively. The compounds were also detected in southern coastal lake water which serves as a source to the St. Lawrence River, but not in mid-lake samples. Similar levels of geosmin and MIB2 were detected in untreated Lake St. Lawrence water, in samples taken following pre-chlorination for zebra mussel control, and in samples taken following conventional treatment at a water filtration plant.

Progressive eutrophication of the lake system has been produced by a high external phosphorus loading which includes phosphorus-rich effluent from a sewage treatment works (STW) in the catchment of the Lakes. Cores were taken from four sites of varying eutrophic status within the Lakes. In the surface sediment layer, organic C, N and P concentrations generally correlate directly with trophic status and reflect distance from the source of P input. At one site, sediment stratigraphy records a clear transition at 20-15 cm depth, marked by a sharp upward increase in porosity, organic C, N, and P, and 'iron-associated'-P; decreases in organic matter C/N, C/P and N/P ratios; a sharp decrease in carbonate, and a change in the subfossil diatom assemblage. Lead-210 dating indicates that this change occurred in the period 1919 to 1938. The diatom stratigraphy and sediment geochemistry suggest that this transition reflects an increase in trophic status at this site, probably as a result of the influx of nutrient-rich water. This took place when the management of the Stackpole estate surrounding the lake system, fell into decline during the period 1919-1938.																			0018-8158					MAY 31	1991	214						171	180		10.1007/BF00050947	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00050947													WOS:A1991FX93500023
J	Tanui, F; Olago, D; Ouma, G; Kuria, Z				Tanui, Florence; Olago, Daniel; Ouma, Gilbert; Kuria, Zacharia			Hydrochemical and isotopic characteristics of the Lodwar Alluvial Aquifer System (LAAS) in Northwestern Kenya and implications for sustainable groundwater use in dryland urban areas	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES												Groundwater is a crucial resource for dryland regions such as this, where surface water resources are limited and unreliable. This paper presents a study of the Lodwar Alluvial Aquifer System (LAAS) in northwestern Kenya and its hydrochemical and isotopic characteristics, with the goal of understanding how to sustainably manage the groundwater system. As a result, the paper focuses on elucidating the hydrogeochemical and river-groundwater interaction (using environmental isotopes and major ion chemistry) of an aquifer that is located in the northwestern dryland of Kenya. The study utilised environmental isotopes of oxygen-18 (18O), deuterium (2H), and tritium (3H) as tracers for establishing recharge sources and origin of groundwater. A sampling campaign involving 112 water samples was conducted to establish isotopic compositions of rain, spring, surface water (rivers, scoop holes, dams and lake) and groundwater at the peak of the wet season in May 2018. The tritium values in the study area ranged from 1.1 to 2.4 TU. Considering the median values of 818O and 82H in surface water and groundwater samples, four clusters emerge based on the degree of enrichment; Cluster 1 comprises the lake water (818O = +6.01, 82H = +41.9); Cluster 2 is the Turkwel and Kawalase river water with slightly positive relative to VSMOW and with different 82H values (+7.6%o versus -9.8%o). The third cluster is the groundwater of the Shallow Alluvial Aquifer (SAA) and the Deep Aquifer (DA) (818O = -0.96%o and -0.70%o; and 82H = +0.4%o and +0.6%o, respectively). The last cluster comprises the most isotope-depleted waters of water pans, scoop holes, Intermediate Aquifer (IA) and Turkana Grit Shall Aquifer (TGSA) with median values ranging from -2.87%o to -2.48%o for 818O and -8.6%o and -16.4%o for 82H. While the SAA is mainly recharge by the Turkwel River, a relationship is observed between the values deuterium in the Kawalase (-9.6%o VSMOW) and IA (-8.6%o VSMOW). Understanding recharge sources and aquifer vulnerability of similar strategic aquifers helps scientists appropriately advise policymakers and the water community who develop sustainable water use, aquifer protection and conservation strategies. In addition, the study contributes scientific evidence of isotopic compositions of groundwater in the Horn of Africa. Furthermore, the evidence of surface water-groundwater interaction presents a case of a fragile dryland ecosystem. Future work will involve the installation of piezometers in strategic aquifer zones to monitor groundwater levels in relation to river gauging data to quantify the amount of recharge and establish the impacts of rainfall variability in the upstream catchment.					; Tanui, Florence/ABR-6520-2022	Tanui, Florence/0000-0002-6632-9146; 													1464-343X	1879-1956				OCT	2023	206								105043	10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2023.105043	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2023.105043		AUG 2023											WOS:001080035000001
J	Adamson, DA; Mabin, MCG; Luly, JG				Adamson, DA; Mabin, MCG; Luly, JG			Holocene isostasy and late Cenozoic development of landforms including Beaver and Radok Lake basins in the Amery Oasis, Prince Charles Mountains, Antarctica	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												Geomorphological observations show no detectable uplift (i.e. falling relative sea level) of Amery Oasis since the establishment of relatively stable sea level during the mid-Holocene. The observations around the basin of Beaver Lake include an absence of raised shoreline features, the presence down to the present tidal limit of in situ ventifacts and residual landforms, the cliffed southern shoreline and adjacent shallow subhorizontal floor of Beaver Lake, and the composition of recent moraines on the basin's north eastern edge. This lack of Holocene uplift is consistent with low uplift rates observed from coastal eases of East Antarctica and suggests minor, rather than major, changes to the Antarctic ice sheet during the most recent Quaternary glacial cycle. The formation of Beaver basin is attributed to late Cenozoic glacial excavation by south flowing ice of the palaeo-Nemesis Glacier, initially eroding when relative sea level was higher than it is today. The basin containing Radok Lake was excavated by the palaeo-Battye Glacier probably when most effective during the numerous long cold periods of the late Cenozoic. The field evidence from landforms and the presence of marine fossil deposits suggests Amery Oasis was not overrun by erosive ice since at least the Pliocene, major ice streams such as Lambert Glacier flowing then, as now, around the oasis.																			0954-1020					SEP	1997	9	3					299	306		10.1017/S0954102097000382	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954102097000382													WOS:A1997XV76100009

Val			In situ, high-resolution time series of dissolved phosphate in Green Bay, Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												In nearly every instance in which the environment has been sampled on a higher resolution in time or space, fundamental processes have come to light that were previously undetected or unobserved. In this study, an autonomous dissolved phosphate sensor was deployed at the Entrance Light station in lower Green Bay, Lake Michigan in 2012 and 2013. Hourly phosphate sensor measurements were compared with other real time sensor data to gain insights into the processes occurring at this site. Results showed that the water column at this location undergoes repeated stratification and turnover during the course of the summer. Often, the stratification results from intrusions of cold hypolimnetic bottom water from the north, while turnover is associated with significant northerly and/or easterly wind events. It was observed that, during calm periods, dissolved phosphate concentrations increased at a rate that was stoichiometrically consistent with the consumption of dissolved oxygen during the remineralization of organic matter; specifically, areal oxygen consumption rates ranged from 3.2 to 43 mmol m(-2) d(-1) and oxygen to phosphate ratios ranged from 120 to 210. At other times, the inverse relationship between dissolved oxygen and dissolved phosphate was not stoichiometrically linked; during these times, areal oxygen depletion rates ranged from 51 to 240 mmol m(-2) d(-1) and oxygen to phosphate ratios ranged from 260 to 2300. Future strategic deployment of multiple in situ dissolved phosphate and other nutrient sensors will enhance the understanding of nutrient cycling in this important aquatic system.

Lakes with a drop in summer water level were less turbid at the time of sampling, mainly because of a lower concentration of inorganic suspended solids (ISS). 3. We also found that older lakes were more turbid than younger lakes and that this was largely because of an increase in phytoplankton. 4. Water clarity was positively related to lake depth and the presence of vegetation. 5. Model calculations indicated that the underwater light climate was strongly affected by chlorophyll and ISS, the latter being the dominant factor affecting Secchi depth. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was less important. 6. The high concentration of ISS suggests that intensive resuspension occurs in most of the lakes. Using a simple wave model, and assuming that vegetation protects sediments against resuspension, we could eliminate wind resuspension as an important process in 90% of the lakes, leaving resuspension by benthivorous fish as probably the most important factor determining transparency. 7. Chlorophyll a concentration showed a strong positive correlation to ISS concentration, suggesting that resuspension may also have a positive effect on phytoplankton biomass in these lakes. 8. In conclusion, in-lake processes, rather than river dynamics, seem to be driving the turbidity of floodplain lakes along the lower River Rhine.

The evaluation of recharge, transmissivity, and water quality formed the basis of qualitative and quantitative assessment. Multiple methods, including water table fluctuation (WTF), chloride mass balance (CMB), physical hydrological modeling (WetSpass), baseflow separation (BFS), and remote sensing techniques like GRACE satellite data, were employed to estimate groundwater recharge across diverse hydrogeological settings. Topographic contrast, fractured orientation, lineament density, hydro-stratigraphic connections, hydraulic gradient, and distribution of high-flux springs were used to assess IGF from Lake Tana to Beles Basin. The monitoring, sampling, and pumping test sites took into account the high hydromorphological and geological variabilities. Recharge rates varied significantly, with mean values of 315 mm/year in Lake Tana Basin, 193 mm/year in Mount Meru, and as low as 4.3 mm/year in Jifarah Plain. Transmissivity ranged from 0.4 to 6904 m(2)/day in Lake Tana Basin, up to 790 m(2)/day in Mount Meru's fractured lava aquifers, and reached 859 m(2)/day in the sedimentary aquifers of the Mekelle area. Water quality issues included high TDS levels (up to 3287 mg/L in Mekelle and 11,141 mg/L in Jifarah), elevated fluoride concentrations (>1.5 mg/L) in 90% of Mount Meru samples, and nitrate pollution in shallow aquifers linked to agricultural practice. This study also highlights the phenomenon of inter-basin deep groundwater flow, emphasizing its role in groundwater potential assessment and challenging conventional water balance assumptions. The findings reveal that hard rock aquifers, particularly weathered/fractured basalt aquifers in volcanic regions, exhibit high potential, while pyroclastic aquifers generally demonstrate lower potential. Concerns regarding high fluoride levels are identified in Mount Meru aquifers. Among sedimentary aquifers in the Mekelle area and Jifarah Plain, limestone intercalated with marl or dolomite rock emerges as having high potential. However, high TDS and high sulfate concentrations are quality issues in some of the areas, quite above the WHO's and each country's drinking water standards. The inter-basin groundwater flow, investigated in this study of Beles Basin, challenges the conventional water balance assumption that the inflow into a hydrological basin is equivalent to the outflow out of the basin, by emphasizing the importance of considering groundwater influx from neighboring basins. These insights contribute novel perspectives to groundwater balance and potential assessment studies, challenging assumptions about groundwater divides.					; Tewolde, Tesfamichael/MVX-2793-2025; Belay, Ashebir/AAH-2582-2020; Bennett, George/GXW-2488-2022; , Adugnaw Birhanu/AAH-5607-2019; Zegeye, Adugnaw Birhanu/AAH-5607-2019; Nigate, Fenta/AAV-8621-2021; Berhane, Gebremedhin/JHU-3721-2023	Bennett, George/0000-0002-5431-2953; Yenehun, Alemu/0000-0002-6580-8161; Gebreyohannes Tewolde, Tesfamichael/0009-0002-0716-7367; Belay, Ashebir Sewale/0000-0001-8113-6433; Nigate, Fenta/0000-0003-1002-9408; Walraevens, Kristine/0000-0002-8116-7376; , Adugnaw Birhanu/0000-0002-2847-4086; 														2073-4441				JAN	2025	17	1							109	10.3390/w17010109	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w17010109													WOS:001394854900001

Societal response to monsoonal fluctuations in NE Thailand during the demise of Angkor Civilisation	HOLOCENE												This paper investigates the possible social responses to changes in the strength of the southwest monsoon in northeastern Thailand during the currency of the Angkor civilisation. These assessments are based on hydrogen and carbon isotope records of leaf waxes (delta D-wax and delta 13C(wax)) from a 2000-year-long wetland sequence of Pa Kho in northeastern Thailand, a region that formed the northern boundary of the Angkor Kingdom. Our data indicate anthropogenic flooding of the Pa Kho wetland through the control of water through dam construction from c. AD 1300 in response to the fluctuating strength of monsoon rains. delta D-wax, a proxy for regional hydroclimate variability, corroborates pre-existing evidence that increased summer monsoon rains, which supported the expansion of the agrarian economy, aided the rise of the Angkorian Empire whereas extreme drought contributed to its demise. Interestingly, our delta D-wax record shows already a gradual decreasing monsoon intensity from c. AD 1000 onwards, although Angkor's prosperity reached its peak at c. AD 1200. We suggest that the complex hydrological system established under royal patronage at Angkor provided a resilient buffer against short-term monsoon fluctuations. The long-term decline in monsoon rains over a similar to 300-year period, combined with ongoing urbanisation, may have stretched the hydrological systems to their limit. We suggest that this was a major factor that contributed to the demise of Angkor in the mid-15th century.					; Smittenberg, Rienk/A-3296-2008; Schenk, Frederik/AAI-7824-2020; Chawchai, Sakonvan/GRF-2426-2022	Schenk, Frederik/0000-0002-4768-9832; Yamoah, Afrifa Kweku Kyei/0000-0001-7488-0459; Chawchai, Sakonvan/0000-0003-0527-9381; Smittenberg, Rienk/0000-0001-5578-9916; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				OCT	2017	27	10					1455	1464		10.1177/0959683617693900	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683617693900													WOS:000412720200003

Both major methods were successful in grouping the axeheads, in matching two of these groupings with established Groups VI and VII and in identifying the coarse-grained ash and porphyritic lava as coming from different and separate sources. Petrographically the axeheads fall into a group of four tuffs belonging to the Lake District Group VI; five microdiorite axeheads that are very close to the Welsh Graig Lwyd Group VII; two porphyritic andesite lavas belonging to no known axe-group but probably from the Lake District, and a single, coarse-grained ash that, despite gross petrographical similarities, is not a member of the Midlands Group XX and is also probably from the Lake District. Geochemically the axeheads can be divided into five macroscopic-geochemical groups. Two groups of four axeheads can be matched with rocks from Graig Lwyd (Group VII), and with intermediate composition rocks from the Borrowdale Volcanic Group (taken as equivalents of Group VI). Of the single axeheads, one may also be Group VII; one (a coarse-grained ash) is chemically dissimilar to the Group XX axeheads; and one an unsourced porphyritic lava is possibly from North Wales or the Lake District.																					1-84217-130-5				2004		8					105	115																WOS:000228177600012

Long-term dynamics of a high-latitude coral reef community at Sodwana Bay, South Africa	CORAL REEFS												Dynamics in reef cover, mortality and recruitment success of a high-latitude coral community in South Africa were studied over 20 yr with the aim to detect the effects of climate change. Coral communities at this locality are the southernmost on the African continent, non-accretive, attain high biodiversity and are dominated by soft corals. Long-term monitoring within fixed transects on representative reef was initiated in 1993 and has entailed annual photo-quadrat surveys and hourly temperature logging. Although sea temperatures rose by 0.15 A degrees C p.a. at the site up to 2000, they have subsequently been decreasing, and the overall trend based on monthly means has been a significant decrease of 0.03 A degrees C p.a. Despite this, minor bleaching was encountered in the region during the 1998 El Nio-Southern Oscillation event, again in the summer of 2000/2001 and in 2005. A significant decreasing trend of 0.95% p.a. in soft coral cover has been evident throughout the monitoring period, attributable to significant decreases in Sinularia and Lobophytum spp. cover. In contrast, hard coral cover gradually and significantly increased up to 2005, this being largely attributable to increases in cover by Acropora spp. Recruitment success and mortality of both soft and hard corals has displayed high inter-annual variability with increasing but non-significant trends in the last 5 yr. The reduction in soft coral cover has been more consistent and greater than that of hard corals, but it is difficult at this stage to attribute this to changes in water quality, acidification-linked accretion or temperature.																			0722-4028	1432-0975				JUN	2017	36	2					369	382		10.1007/s00338-016-1531-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00338-016-1531-z													WOS:000401627400002

JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Anthropogenic pressures, including climate change, are causing nonlinear changes in ecosystems globally. The development of reliable early warning indicators (EWIs) to predict these changes is vital for the adaptive management of ecosystems and the protection of biodiversity, natural capital and ecosystem services. Increased variance and autocorrelation are potential early warning indicators and can be readily estimated from ecological time series. Here, we undertook a comprehensive test of the consistency between early warning indicators and nonlinear abundance change across species, trophic levels and ecosystem types. 2. We tested whether long-term abundance time series of 55 taxa (126 data sets) across multiple trophic levels in marine and freshwater ecosystems showed (i) significant nonlinear change in abundance 'turning points' and (ii) significant increases in variance and autocorrelation ('early warning indicators'). For each data set, we then quantified the prevalence of three cases: true positives (early warning indicators and associated turning point), false negatives (turning point but no associated early warning indicators) and false positives (early warning indicators but no turning point). 3. True positives were rare, representing only 9% (16 of 170) of cases using variance, and 13% (19 of 152) of cases using autocorrelation. False positives were more prevalent than false negatives (53% vs. 38% for variance; 47% vs. 40% for autocorrelation). False results were found in every decade and across all trophic levels and ecosystems. 4. Time series that contained true positives were uncommon (8% for variance; 6% for autocorrelation), with all but one time series also containing false classifications. Coherence between the types of early warning indicators was generally low with 43% of time series categorized differently based on variance compared to autocorrelation. 5. Synthesis and applications. Conservation management requires effective early warnings of ecosystem change using readily available data, and variance and autocorrelation in abundance data have been suggested as candidates. However, our study shows that they consistently fail to predict nonlinear change. For early warning indicators to be effective tools for preventative management of ecosystem change, we recommend that multivariate approaches of a suite of potential indicators are adopted, incorporating analyses of anthropogenic drivers and process-based understanding.					burthe, sarah/Q-9505-2016; Carvalho, Laurence/D-3276-2009; Winfield, Ian/I-6085-2012; Maberly, Stephen/J-3361-2012; May, Linda/D-7943-2011; Mackay, Eleanor/F-5490-2013; Dudley, Bernard/D-3257-2009; Spears, Bryan/I-3688-2012; Thackeray, Stephen/D-2415-2013; Burthe, Sarah/Q-9505-2016; Daunt, Francis/K-6688-2012; Henrys, Peter/K-3321-2012; Gunn, Iain/H-1107-2019	Carvalho, Laurence/0000-0002-9768-9902; Thackeray, Stephen/0000-0003-3274-2706; Burthe, Sarah/0000-0001-8871-3432; Henrys, Peter/0000-0003-4758-1482; 													0021-8901	1365-2664				JUN	2016	53	3					666	676		10.1111/1365-2664.12519	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.12519													WOS:000380065400006

We explore the use of cladoceran-macrophyte relationships in the sedimentary sequence of a small lake, Lagunillo del Tejo, as a tool for infer-ring extreme climate conditions. This lake is a karstic sink hole situated in Iberian Ranges (Spain), which is very sensitive to rainfall variations. We analyzed cladoceran subfossils and plant macrofossils from cores whose bottom dates back to the 12th century. Cladoceran species were divided into four groups based on their habitat preferences. Graptoleberis testudinaria and Acroperus angustatus were most associated with aquatic plants. A concordance between the variation in the sedimentary profile of plant-associated cladocerans, macrophyte remains (Chara and Ranunculus subgenus Batrachium) and lake level was observed. The different zones resulting from constrained cluster analyses of both communities coincided and also with the reduced and oxidized zonation of the sediment cores. Both paleoecological proxies indicate the existence of four main dry periods during the last millennia (ca. 1200AD, ca. 1500AD, ca. 1900AD and last decades) causing the lowering of the lake level and consequently the drying up of the outer ring of macrophytes and the loss of plant-associated cladocerans. These arid periods alternate with wetter phases such as the interval from the last quarter of the 17th century to the first decade of the 18th century (corresponding to LIA). Our approach can be used to trace the hydrological past of similar systems.

Both lagunas have high algal biomass and pH and are surrounded by a macrophyte, fringe of Juncus spp. and Scirpus spp. The effect of the macroinvertebrate community on decomposition rates (k) of Juncus maritimus was measured in both lagunas using the litter bag method over a one year period after which less than 10% of the original litter bag material remained. Two different mesh sizes, coarse (5 mm) and fine (0.25 mm), were used to evaluate macroinvertebrate community effects on decomposition. Decomposition rates were rapid, with k values of 0.0162 day(-1) in coarse bags and 0.0094 day(-1) for fine bags at Santa Olalla and 0.0095, 0.0088 day(-1) for coarse and fine bags, respectively, at Dulce. Both lagunas had similar densities of macroinvertebrates, with a dominance of shredder-gatherer chironomids. However, densities of scrapers (Ancylidae) increased in Santa Olalla in spring but were almost absent in Dulce. The influence of different physical and chemical parameters and of the macroinvertebrate community on the decomposition process is studied. In spite of some potential confounding effects in the use of fine mesh bags in standing water systems, it is concluded that morphometrical characteristics of the lagunas are important in controlling decomposition rates.

A wide variety of measuring concepts, measuring instruments, and numerical models have been combined with each other in order to achieve a comprehensive representation of the entry of groundwater into Lake Constance. Based on a catchment-wide hydrogeological model, a groundwater model for the Lake Constance region was implemented, which for the first time calculates temporally differentiated and spatially highly-resolved quantitative estimates of groundwater inflows into Lake Constance. With a method toolbox for identifying and quantifying groundwater in lakes, groundwater exfiltration into Lake Constance can be localized and quantified. A multi-parameter water body signature allows to obtain further information on groundwater inflows into the lake. The measured values obtained were interpreted and checked for their plausibility by means of inverse modeling with a spatially high-resolution 3-dimensional hydrodynamic lake model. With a coupled groundwater-lake model, the entire system of hydrogeological context/groundwater and lake can be seamlessly modeled for the first time. Measuring methods, tools and models are also used in Lake Ammersee and Lake Steisslinger See, thus demonstrating the transferability to other lakes and into the general water management practice.

Elucidating microbial mechanisms of microcystin-LR degradation in Lake Erie beach sand through metabolomics and metatranscriptomics	WATER RESEARCH												As one of five Laurentian Great Lakes, Lake Erie ranks among the top freshwater drinking sources and ecosystems globally. Historical and current agriculture mismanagement and climate change sustains the environmental landscape for late summer cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms, and consequently, cyanotoxins such as microcystin (MC). Microcystin microbial degradation is a promising mitigation strategy, however the mechanisms controlling the breakdown of MCs in Lake Erie are not well understood. Pelee Island, Ontario, Canada is located in the western basin of Lake Erie and the bacterial community in the sand has demonstrated the capacity of metabolizing the toxin. Through a multi-omic approach, the metabolic, functional and taxonomical signatures of the Pelee Island microbial community during MC-LR degradation was investigated over a 48-hour period to comprehensively study the degradation mechanism. Cleavage of bonds surrounding nitrogen atoms and the upregulation of nitrogen deamination (dadA, alanine dehydrogenase, leucine dehydrogenase) and assimilation genes (glnA, gltB) suggests a targeted isolation of nitrogen by the microbial community for energy production. Methylotrophic pathways RuMP and H4MPT control assimilation and dissimilation of carbon, respectively and differential abundance of Methylophilales indicates an interconnected role through electron exchange of denitrification and methylotrophic pathways. The detected metabolites did not resolve a clear breakdown pathway, but rather the diversity of products in combination with taxonomic and functional results supports that a variety of strategies are applied, such as epoxidation, hydroxylation, and aromatic degradation. Annual repeated exposure to the toxin may have allowed the community to adaptatively establish a novel pathway through functional plasticity and horizontal gene transfer. The culmination of these results reveals the complexity of the Pelee Island sand community and supports a dynamic and cooperative metabolism between microbial species to achieve MC degradation.

J	Oldham, CE; Lavery, PS				Oldham, CE; Lavery, PS			Porewater nutrient fluxes in a shallow fetch-limited estuary	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The Swan River Estuary is a shallow meso-eutrophic system in SW Australia. The dominant summer wind pattern in the region includes a strong SW sea breeze each afternoon. We hypothesised that such a regular and significant wind event may be important in causing the release of sediment porewater with subsequent effects on water quality and nutrient dynamics. To test this, we conducted a multidisciplinary field experiment in 1996 during which we measured temperature microstructure profiles (to yield turbulence parameters), velocity profiles, light profiles and nutrient profiles. Bottom shear stresses were estimated via the viscous-dissipation method, which can be used in stratified and unstratified water bodies or during convective cooling, all of which are likely to affect sediment-water dynamics in shallow systems. We observed that, after the sea breeze began, there was a dramatic breakdown of temperature stratification, an increase in mean velocities and an increase in turbulence levels at the sediment-water interface. This coincided with a doubling of water column ammonium concentrations. However, this pulse of nutrients was shown to occur prior to conditions necessary for sediment resuspension. We therefore attribute the increased porewater fluxes to interactions between increasingly energetic hydrodynamics and the benthic environment. The technique used here to measure porewater fluxes as a function of hydrodynamic forcing is an excellent alternative to benthic chamber experiments, which isolate the sediments from the overlying hydrodynamics.					; Oldham, Carolyn/F-8458-2013	Oldham, Carolyn/0000-0003-2968-6889; Lavery, Paul/0000-0001-5162-273X													0171-8630	1616-1599					1999	183						39	47		10.3354/meps183039	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps183039													WOS:000081803500004

Mean standard length (mm +/- standard error) of gravid females significantly differed between sample waters, with the Atlantic Ocean population being the longest (189 12.3 mm) and Lake Michigan population the shortest (122 +/- 0.3 mm). Mean thiamine concentrations (nmol/g standard error) for single-year samples for Lake Huron, Lake Michigan, and Little Clear Pond (New York) were 9.9 +/- 0.8, 3.9 +/- 0.7, and 8.1 +/- 2.3 nmol/g, respectively. Thiamine concentrations for multiple-year samples ranged from 1.1 to 15.6 for Lake Ontario, from 2.6 to 3.3 for Lake Erie, from 5.0 to 9.9 for Lake Superior, and from 10.9 to 13.3 for the Atlantic Ocean (Fore River). Although highly variable within populations and across years, thiamine concentrations in most spawning adults appeared to be adequate in all the waters for the years sampled except for 2006 and 2009 in Lake Ontario and 2009 in Lake Erie.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				MAR	2012	27	1					31	39		10.1080/02705060.2011.603204	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2011.603204													WOS:000301759600003

Different numbers of perch were added to each compartment beginning in the spring of 1993. The species composition and abundance of phytoplankton, pH, nutrient concentrations, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and chlorophyll a content were analyzed at regular intervals during 1991 and 1998. The division of the lake resulted in divergent developments in the physical and chemical environment of the compartments. This study compared the phytoplankton assemblages of the Northeast- (NE) and Southwest- (SW) basins which differed strongly in chemistry during the investigation period. Divergent developments in phytoplankton species composition in both basins can be explained by changes in physical and chemical conditions (bottom-up effects). Increased pH values and DOC concentrations probably favoured mass developments of the dinoflagellate Gymnodinium uberrimum since 1993, while increased nutrients (dissolved inorganic carbon, total nitrogen and especially total phosphorus) as well as further changes in pH and DOC led to the dominance of the raphidophyte Gonyostomum semen in 1998. This bloom was characterized by extreme biomasses of up to 143 mg l(-1) wet weight, corresponding with high chlorophyll a concentrations of up to 413 mug l(-1) at the same time. In contrast, no significant relationship between experimental manipulations by piscivorous fish stocking (top-down effects) and phytoplankton biomass were observed.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				APR	2001	448	1-3					83	96		10.1023/A:1017520501488	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017520501488													WOS:000169863400010

We first critically evaluate, extract, and summarize paleoenvironmental and paleohydrologic records. Then, we propose a framework of eastern Mediterranean atmospheric circulation features interacting with the morphology and location of the southeast Mediterranean coast. Together they strongly control the spatial distribution of rainfall and wind pattern. This cyclone-physiography interaction enforces the observed rainfall patterns by hampering rainfall generation south and southeast of the latitude of the north Sinai coast, currently at 31 degrees 15'. The proposed framework explains the much-increased rains in Lebanon and northern Israel and Jordan as deduced from pollen, rise and maintenance of Lake Lisan, and speleothem fort-nation in areas currently and and semiarid. The proposed framework also accounts for the southward and eastward transition into semiarid, arid, and hyperarid deserts as expressed in thick loess accumulation at the deserts' margins, dune migration from west to east in the Sinai and the western Negev, and the formation of hyperarid (< 80 min yr(-1)) gypsic-salic soils in the southern Negev and Sinai. Our climatic synthesis explains the hyperarid condition in the southern Negev, located only 200-250 km south of the much-increased rains in the north, probably reflecting a steeper rainfall gradient than the present-day gradient from the wetter Levant into its bordering southern and eastern deserts. At present, the rainiest winter seasons in Lebanon and northern and central Israel are associated with more frequent (+20%), deeper Cyprus Lows traversing the eastern Mediterranean at approximately the latitude of southern Turkey. Even these wettest years in northern Israel do not yield above average annual rainfall amounts in the hyperarid southern Negev. This region is mainly influenced by the Active Red Sea Troughs that produce only localized rains. The eastern Mediterranean Cyprus Lows also produce more dust storms and transport higher amounts of suspended dust to the loess area than any other atmospheric pattern. Concurrent rainfall and dust are essential to the late Pleistocene formation of the elongated thick loess zone along the desert northern margin. Even with existing dust storms, the lack of rain and very sparse vegetation account for the absence of late Pleistocene loess sequences from the southern Negev and the formation of hyperarid soils. When the north Sinai coast shifted 30-70 km northwest due to last glacial global sea level lowering, the newly exposed coastal areas supplied the sand and dust to these active eastern Mediterranean cyclones. This enforced the latitude of the northern boundary of the loess zone to be directly due east of the LGM shoreline. This shift of coast to the northwest inhibited rainfall in the southern Levant deserts and maintained their hyperaridity. Concurrently, frequent deep eastern Mediterranean Cyprus Lows were funneled along the northern Mediterranean increasing (probably doubling) the rains in central and northern Israel, Lebanon, southwestern Syria and northern Jordan. These storms and rains formed lakes, forests, and speleothems only a short distance north of the deserts in the southern Levant. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

Effects of hypolimnetic oxygenation on the dietary consumption of methane-oxidizing bacteria by Chironomus larvae in dimictic mesotrophic lakes	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Hypolimnetic oxygenation is a technique used to restore oxic conditions in the summer hypolimnia of lakes, thereby reducing internal P recycling, metal flux, and increasing fish habitat. O-2 at the sediment-water interface plays a critical role in regulation of CH4 flux from lakes. Sediment microorganisms responsible for both methanogenesis and oxidation uniquely discriminate against C-13. Therefore, stable isotope analysis (SIA) can be used to estimate CH4-derived biomass in aquatic food webs. For example, investigators have used SIA to show that methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB) may have high dietary importance for Chironomus in anaerobic and hypoxic environments. We proposed that oxygenation would reduce CH4 production and subsequent synthesis of CH4-derived biomass in Chironomus larvae, decreasing the influence of CH4 pathways to overall aquatic food webs. We tested our hypothesis in mesotrophic lakes with and without oxygenation. Chironomus larvae were C-13-depleted compared to available organic matter in treated and untreated lakes, signifying that MOB consumption may be an important energy source for these organisms. However, our hypothesis was refuted. Larvae from lakes with oxygenation displayed higher dietary MOB contribution than larvae from the untreated lake. Our results suggest oxygenation may alter chemotrophic energy flow within aquatic and linked terrestrial food webs.

Thirty-Year Time Series of PCB Concentrations in a Small Invertivorous Fish (Notropis Hudsonius): An Examination of Post-1990 Trajectory Shifts in the Lower Great Lakes	ECOSYSTEMS												The production and use of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have been restricted in North America since the 1970s; yet, PCBs are still detected in all components of the Great Lakes ecosystems. Our objective was to determine how total PCB (PCBT) concentrations in spottail shiner (Notropis hudsonius) changed over the period 1975-2007 in the lower Great Lakes. Trends were best described by three basic models: (1) piecewise models where concentrations followed a decreasing trend before the break point (T) and an increasing trend post-T (Lake St. Clair, eastern Lake Erie, and upper Niagara River); (2) piecewise models where concentrations decreased both pre- and post-T but where the rate of decline post-T was less than that pre-T (western Lake Erie and Niagara River's Tonawanda Channel); and (3) linear models where concentrations declined at a constant rate across the entire temporal range (lower Niagara River and western Lake Ontario). Piecewise models best described the trends in shallow areas that are susceptible to full water-column mixing whereas constant-slope models best described trends in deeper areas. For piecewise models, T typically occurred during the years 1988-1992. Two events coincided with this timing: (1) a sustained shift towards warming summer temperatures and (2) the proliferation of dreissenid mussels (Dreissena spp.). The weight-of-evidence suggests that the dreissenid invasions were a more likely driving factor behind the observed trends.					; Jackson, Donald/J-6441-2013; Reiner, Eric/A-4094-2017	Jackson, Donald A/0000-0002-6107-0753; Reiner, Eric/0000-0002-5349-2139													1432-9840	1435-0629				APR	2011	14	3					415	429		10.1007/s10021-011-9419-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-011-9419-9													WOS:000290492700006

In 1984, a limnic eruption occurred at LM, releasing large amounts of magmatic CO2 gas that had accumulated in the lake. The CO2 gas asphyxiated 37 people in the surrounding area. Despite this hazard, the volcanic history of LM maar remains unknown. This study presents the first comprehensive results of lithostratigraphy, physical volcanology, 14C dating and petrology of LM eruptive products. The lake has a WSW-ENE-aligned morphology with three main craters, the walls of which expose tephra and lava that can be divided into 5 stratigraphic units (A, B, C, D, and E from bottom to top). Unit A, a pyroclastic surge deposit in the NW, was produced by a phreatomagmatic eruption and deposited on a thick (ca.170 cm) paleosol developed on granitic basement. The paleosol yields a 14C age of ca 1.3 cal. ka. Units B (weathered scoria fall) and C (lava flow) in the NW part of the lake were respectively produced by strombolian and effusive eruptive activities. The SE side consists of unit D (scoria fall) a product of violent strombolian activity and unit E (voluminous surge) deposited by phreatomagmatic activity. The surge deposits of units A and E are rich in lithic fragments such as granite and lava, indicating subterranean excavation of country (accidental) and volcanic (accessory) rocks. A short time break represented by thin (ca. 15 cm, 0.1-0.3 cal. ka) paleosol can be recognized between units A and E in the distal facies. Based on the temporal and spatial distribution of these deposits, the eruption history of LM can be grouped into two stages. The first stage led to the development of the western and central craters and is recorded by units A to C in the NE section. The second stage proceeded after a short hiatus represented by the thin paleosol and a shift of the eruptive locus to the SE part of the lake. This gave rise to the largest eastern crater characterized by well-preserved units D and E. The LM case study reveals a potential time-space evolutionary pathway for crater formation, implying a polygenetic origin. Juvenile materials from the units are basanitic in composition with narrow chemical variation, suggesting a common magma system through the two stages. Silica content gradually increases from units A to E (SiO2 = 43.4 to 45.8 wt%), suggesting that the magma was differentiated with time (from units A to E) and						Kaneda, Yasuaki/0000-0002-9937-8198													0377-0273	1872-6097				APR	2025	460								108265	10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2025.108265	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2025.108265		JAN 2025											WOS:001423753100001

Here, we identify the sedimentary signature of glacial and non-glacial processes, including GLOFs, based on lacustrine sediments from the distal glacier-fed Lake Buarvatnet in western Norway. Historically documented GLOFs in 2002 CE and during the 1980s CE are identified in the Pb-210- and C-14-dated sediments. These events have the same sedimentary signature as 12 earlier events throughout the Holocene interpreted to represent previous GLOFs in thecatchment. The GLOFs are interpreted to have occurred during periods when the glacier extent was similar to the modern positions, and the events are thus used to pinpoint past positions of the glacier terminus and, hence, the equilibrium line altitudes (ELAs). The results indicate that the glacier Svartenutbreen, located at the eastern part of Folgefonna, had a similar size in 2002 CE as c. 8200-8300cal. a BP, corresponding to the 8.2 ka event in the North Atlantic region. The regrowth of SOrfonna after the Holocene Thermal Optimum occurred at c. 6900cal. a BP and Svartenutbreen was at modern size and extent in the periods c. 6400, c. 5450, c. 4850, c. 3850, c. 3550 and c. 1650cal. a BP. Since 1650cal. a BP, we infer that the glacier was larger than the 2002 CE glacier extent until 1910 CE when a GLOF occurred. Svartenutbreen has been retreating since 1910 CE, which led to the ice damming of the two historical GLOFs in the 1980s and 2002 CE separated by a glacier advance in the 1990s CE. The findings are discussed and compared to other regional glacier reconstructions in Norway, and emphasize the value of identifying and utilizing GLOFs as an indicator of past ELA variability.

Earthquake ruptures were prescribed on a 3D fault representation that satisfies geologic constraints and maintained distinct strands for the Warm Springs and for the East Bench and Cottonwood faults. Response spectral accelerations (SA; 1.5-10 s; 5% damping) were measured, and average distance scaling was well fit by a simple functional form that depends on the near-source intensity level SA(0) (T) and a corner distance R-c: SA (R,T) = SA(0) (T) (1 + (R/R-c))(-1). Period-dependent hanging-wall effects manifested and increased the ground motions by factors of about 2-3, though the effects appeared partially attributable to differences in shallow site response for sites on the hanging wall and footwall of the fault. Comparisons with modern ground-motion prediction equations (GMPEs) found that the simulated ground motions were generally consistent, except within deep sedimentary basins, where simulated ground motions were greatly underpredicted. Ground-motion variability exhibited strong lateral variations and, at some sites, exceeded the ground-motion variability indicated by GMPEs. The effects on the ground motions of changing the values of the five kinematic rupture parameters can largely be explained by three predominant factors: distance to high-slip subevents, dynamic stress drop, and changes in the contributions from directivity. These results emphasize the need for further characterization of the underlying distributions and covariances of the kinematic rupture parameters used in 3D ground-motion simulations employed in probabilistic seismic-hazard analyses.					; Ramirez-Guzman, Leonardo/H-3242-2012; Stephenson, Wayne/W-6940-2019	Angster, Stephen/0000-0001-9250-8415; Moschetti, Morgan/0000-0001-7261-0295; 													0037-1106	1943-3573				AUG	2017	107	4					1704	1723		10.1785/0120160307	http://dx.doi.org/10.1785/0120160307													WOS:000412904900009
J	Yoshida, Y				Yoshida, Y			Relationship between the dominant occurrence of Microcystis aeruginosa and water quality or meteorological factors in the south basin of Lake Biwa	NIPPON SUISAN GAKKAISHI												In the south basin of Lake Biwa, Microcystis aeruginosa dominantly occurred and the water blooms were formed at the limit area in late summer of 1983, 1987, 1988, 1990, and 1994. The relationship between the dominant occurrence of M. aeruginosa and water quality and the meteorological condition in the south basin of Lake Biwa was examined, referring to data from Shiga Prefecture and the meteorological Agency. The changes of water quality in the south basin in early September of 1980-1994 showed a remarkable fluctuation of TP (total phosphorus), DIN (dissolved inorganic nitrogen), DIP (dissolved inorganic phosphorus), DIN:DIP, TN (total nitrogen):DIN, and TP:DIP ratios, and M. aeruginosa usually occurred in the water with comparatively low DIN:DIP ratio. The comparison of each average water quality with the dominant species of phytoplanktons in early September of 1980-1994 showed that M. aeruginosa dominantly occurred in the waters with low DIN, DIP, and DIN:DIP ratio and high TN:DIN and TP:DIP ratios. The species occurred in the years with the meteorological conditions of high air temperature, long sunshine time, and comparatively low rainfall (precipitation) during August. These features of M. aeruginosa were contrasted remarkably with those of Rhodomonas sp.																			0021-5392					JUL	1997	63	4					531	536																WOS:A1997XV58500009

Assessing the associated hazard requires constraining the time frequency of such events. Since large rockslides are not common, estimating their frequency requires recording them over a long period of time. The Holocene period then appears as pertinent, which implies that rockslide features have to be dated with absolute chronology methods. This paper presents a characterisation and dating of the Lauvitel rockslide, one of the largest Holocene rockslides in the French Alps. Combining field observation with electrical tomography profiles performed on the rockslide deposit that constitutes the Lauvitel Lake dam allows estimating its volume at a minimum of 12 x 10(6) m(3). In addition, cosmic ray exposure dating using in situ-produced Be-10 concentration measurements has been applied to date seven samples collected both on the main sliding surface and on blocks lying on the dam and further downstream. Ages obtained are consistent with a single large rockslide event, which occurred at 4.7 +/- 0.4 Be-10-ka and formed two distinct deposits. However, from a mechanical point of view, these clearly separated deposits could hardly result from a single movement. A comparison of their reach angles with those reviewed in the literature highlights that the lower deposit must result from rock avalanches larger than 10(7) m(3), while the upper one (the Lauvitel dam) must result from several events smaller than 10(6) m(3). In the context of hazard assessment for land use planning, these events can, however, be considered as a unique event.					; Delunel, Romain/J-3319-2014; Braucher, Braucher/Q-5971-2017; Braucher, Regis/Q-5971-2017; Deparis, Jacques/HOF-0950-2023; Hantz, Didier/AAF-6806-2020	Deparis, Jacques/0000-0003-2666-1555; Delunel, Romain/0000-0001-7752-6498; Hantz, Didier/0000-0002-9159-0653; Bourles, Didier/0000-0001-5991-6126; Braucher, Regis/0000-0002-4637-4302; 													1612-510X	1612-5118				DEC	2010	7	4					393	400		10.1007/s10346-010-0221-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10346-010-0221-0													WOS:000284329800001

The potential of alpine glacial deposits to record the YD is of interest because alpine glaciers would be likely to leave a morainal record even during minor, short-lived advances caused by a period of deteriorating climate. In the Cordilleran ranges of North and South America there are several candidate moraines, many bracketed between radiocarbon ages of ca. 12 and 10 ka, which may be YD in age. The best examples are in the Canadian and American Rockies, the Ecuadorian, Peruvian and Bolivian Andes, and around the Patagonian Ice Cap. In most cases temporal brackets are not narrow enough and some radiocarbon ages may not be accurate enough to allow correlation at the present time. There are two cases of Lateglacial readvance whose ages are interpreted to match or fall within the YD interval: an advance of the Crowfoot Glacier in Canada is interpreted to have occurred within the period ca. 11.3 and 10 C-14 ka BP, and an advance of the Reschreiter Glacier in Ecuador is interpreted to have culminated in the period ca. 11 to 10.6 C-14 ka BP. The latter interpretation depends on an assumption that lake-level variations were caused by glacier advances and retreats.																			0277-3791						1995	14	9					823	832		10.1016/0277-3791(95)00064-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0277-3791(95)00064-X													WOS:A1995UH76700003

All feces contained seeds and some of them seedlings of aquatic herbaceous species, offering the opportunity to study the role of the manatee as an endozoochoric dispersal agent in the Amazonian floodplains. The feces were collected, analyzed, and the intact seeds were separated, identifying 9 morphotypes of aquatic herbaceous plants. Whole seeds were sectioned and immersed in a tetrazolium solution to assess viability of the embryos. The seeds of the species Luziola spruceana were present in all fecal samples. In 17 feces, 79 seedlings of L. sprucena, Eleocharis subarticulata, Bacopa egensis, Cyperus blepharoleptos, and Cyperus sp. were observed. The Amazon manatee migrates annually between different types of floodable environments due to the rise and fall of water levels. In these two phases of the hydrological cycle there is the availability of fruiting aquatic herbaceous plants on which it feeds. In this way, the Amazonian manatee can be considered a gardener of the Amazon floodplains, as it fertilizes the waters with nutrients that favor plant productivity and acts in the dispersal, colonization and plant succession in these environments. This fact opens a range of research opportunities and considerably elevates the importance of the manatee in the maintenance and diversity of aquatic plants, as well as in maintaining the balance of trophic chains in its living areas.

This research paper presents an exhaustive inventory of crustaceans and fish species from the Yucatan Peninsula's epicontinental, underground, and anchialine aquatic systems. Using records spanning from 1936 to 2024, this study analyzed over 2600 entries across 670 aquatic systems, including cenotes, flooded cave lakes, springs, and wetlands. A total of 329 species were recorded, comprising 117 fish and 212 crustacean species. The richness and endemism of these species were assessed through a completeness analysis, utilizing non-parametric models (Chao 2, Jackknife 1, Bootstrap) to estimate potential species richness. Notably, the region exhibits high endemism, especially among crustaceans, with up to 50 species and 2 endemic families being unique to the Yucatan Peninsula. This study underscores the importance of the eastern YP for crustaceans and the central YP for fish, highlighting areas critical for conservation.

The bloom began at the mouth of a small river. Upon crossing a village, this collected all its untreated sewage, including the nutrients needed for the growth of Peridinium. The Peridinium population then dispersed into the main water body, forming a narrow strip of brown, and finally accumulated in front of the dam, where the highest density was found. The visible bloom lasted for about 4 weeks, with Peridinium constituting over 90% of total phytoplankton biomass, and Microcystis aeruginosa second in line of abundance. On April 26, a heavy precipitation resulted in a significant decrease in water transparency. On May 20, the water temperature (WT) was 3 degrees C higher than on May 5. The change in hydrology due to the heavy precipitation may have been the direct factor triggering the decay of the bloom, and it was accelerated by the dramatic increase in water temperature. In comparison with other reservoirs, the present Peridinium bloom shares several common features with others, namely nutrient supply, water temperature, and hydrodynamics, all of which play major roles in the initiation and decay of such blooms.																			0077-0639		978-94-007-2006-0				2012	91						123	134		10.1007/978-94-007-2007-7_8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-2007-7_8	10.1007/978-94-007-2007-7												WOS:000301802900008

Atmospheric vapour and precipitation are not in isotopic equilibrium in a continental mountain environment	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Isotopic exchange with atmospheric vapour can strongly influence the isotopic values of evaporating surface water bodies (e.g., lakes), influencing our understanding of hydrological processes across aquatic and terrestrial environments. Rather than measure the isotopic values of the atmosphere directly, it is much more common to estimate values by assuming equilibrium with local precipitation. This assumption may introduce large errors, thereby biasing hydrological inferences and understanding. The pattern and magnitude of this error has been quantified only in a few circumstances. We compared observations of vapour and precipitation isotope values over a four-year record collected in a montane environment in the central Rocky Mountains of North America. We further investigated factors and conditions promoting disequilibrium. Scenario comparisons assessed the impact of theoretical and methodological elements on the accuracy of the equilibrium assumption. We found that the equilibrium assumption was not well supported by direct and continuous observations of vapour isotopes using tower-based laser isotope spectroscopy, particularly during the summer months. Across all scenarios, errors associated with the equilibrium assumption were high, credibly ranging from 14 to 154 parts per thousand for delta H-2 and 1.5 to 16.3 parts per thousand for delta O-18. Environmental covariates (e.g., vapour pressure deficit, air pressure) helped explain some of the apparent disequilibrium. Although the equilibrium assumption for estimating atmospheric vapour isotope values may not be applicable in a continental montane environment, our findings highlight opportunities for using direct vapour isotope measurements to better understand vapour sources, air mass mixing, and phase changes over complex mountainous terrain, which in turn may better constrain regional- to global-scale hydrological process estimates, such as evapotranspiration rates and the water budgets of mountain lakes.					; Mercer, Jason/AAE-8703-2019; Williams, David/A-6407-2014	Mercer, Jason/0000-0002-6193-5032; Williams, David/0000-0003-3627-5260													0885-6087	1099-1085				JUL 1	2020	34	14					3078	3101		10.1002/hyp.13775	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.13775		MAY 2020											WOS:000534968400001
J	Carrasco, NK; Perissinotto, R				Carrasco, Nicola K.; Perissinotto, Renzo			Development of a Halotolerant Community in the St. Lucia Estuary (South Africa) during a Hypersaline Phase	PLOS ONE												Background: The St. Lucia Estuary, Africa's largest estuarine lake, is currently experiencing unprecedented freshwater deprivation which has resulted in a northward gradient of drought effects, with hypersaline conditions in its northern lakes. Methodology/Principal Findings: This study documents the changes that occurred in the biotic communities at False Bay from May 2010 to June 2011, in order to better understand ecosystem functioning in hypersaline habitats. Few zooplankton taxa were able to withstand the harsh environmental conditions during 2010. These were the flatworm Macrostomum sp., the harpacticoid copepod Cletocamptus confluens, the cyclopoid copepod Apocyclops cf. dengizicus and the ciliate Fabrea cf. salina. In addition to their exceptional salinity tolerance, they were involved in a remarkably simple food web. In June 2009, a bloom of an orange-pigmented cyanobacterium (Cyanothece sp.) was recorded in False Bay and persisted uninterruptedly for 18 months. Stable isotope analysis suggests that this cyanobacterium was the main prey item of F. cf. salina. This ciliate was then consumed by A. cf. dengizicus, which in turn was presumably consumed by flamingos as they flocked in the area when the copepods attained swarming densities. On the shore, cyanobacteria mats contributed to a population explosion of the staphylinid beetle Bledius pilicollis. Although zooplankton disappeared once salinities exceeded 130, many taxa are capable of producing spores or resting cysts to bridge harsh periods. The hypersaline community was disrupted by heavy summer rains in 2011, which alleviated drought conditions and resulted in a sharp increase in zooplankton stock and diversity. Conclusions/Significance: Despite the current freshwater deprivation crisis, the False Bay region has shown to be resilient, harboring a unique biodiversity with species that are capable of enduring harsh environmental conditions. However, further freshwater deprivation may extend beyond the physiological thresholds of this community, as well as other unique biodiversity components which this system sustains.

Use of sedimentary diatoms from multiple lakes to distinguish between past changes in trophic state and climate: evidence for climate change in northern Germany during the past 5,000 years	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Fossil diatoms from lake sediments have been used to infer both past trophic state and climate conditions. In Europe, climate reconstructions focused on northern and alpine regions because these areas are climatically sensitive and anthropogenic impact was low. In contrast, anthropogenic impact was often high in the central European lowlands, such as northern Germany, beginning in the Neolithic Age, similar to 3700 BC. Since that time, trophic state change was the main factor that affected diatom assemblages in central European lowland lakes. Therefore, it was considered difficult or impossible to identify climate changes in the region using sedimented diatoms. We used diatom assemblage changes, diatom-inferred total phosphorus concentrations and the relative abundance of planktonic diatoms from sediments of three lakes that differ in their location, size, morphology, catchment area and current trophic state to test whether we could distinguish between trophic state and climate signals over the past 5,000 years in northern Germany. In this study, changes in trophic state and climate were well differentiated. In the study lakes, relative abundance of planktonic diatoms seems to be linked to the length of lake mixing phases. Planktonic diatom abundance decreased during years with shorter mixing duration, and these shorter mixing times probably reflect colder winters. The diatom-inferred periods of short mixing phases from 1000 BC to AD 500 and from AD 1300 to 1800 coincide well with two known cooling phases in Europe and the North Atlantic region.

J	RASK, HM; SCHOENAU, JJ				RASK, HM; SCHOENAU, JJ			C-13 NATURAL-ABUNDANCE VARIATIONS IN CARBONATES AND ORGANIC-CARBON FROM BOREAL FOREST WETLANDS	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												C-13 natural abundance variations were measured in peat soil and vegetation from two contrasting boreal forest wetlands: an upland watershed basin and a permanently saturated lowland mire. Evidence of methane oxidation was shown in the permanently saturated wetland with deltaC-13 values as low as -97 parts per thousand in carbonate minerals found in floating peat mats. It is postulated that C-13 depleted CH4 is oxidized in the,mat and reacts with calcium ions to form calcite (identified through x-ray diffraction). Methane flux measurements during the summer of 1992 showed much lower fluxes in areas with floating peat mats relative to open water. Secondary carbonates in the basin peat have isotope compositions close to the deltaC-13 values of the peat organic carbon (25 parts per thousand), indicating their origin from fermentation and possibly from sulfate-reduction. In the upland basin peat deposits, the deltaC-13(PDB) Values of organic C were constant with depth, while the permanently saturated mire had localities of C-13 enrichment in deeper layers of the peat. The C-13 enrichment may reflect areas of intense CH4 production in which C-13 enriched residual substrate is left behind during the production of highly C-13 depleted CH4.

Ecosystem shift of a mountain lake under climate and human pressure: A move out from the safe operating space	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												A multiproxy approach including chironomid, diatom, pollen and geochemical analyses was applied on short gravitational cores retrieved from an alpine lake (Lacul Balea) in the Southern Carpathians (Romania) to unveil how this lake responded to natural and anthropogenic forcing over the past 500 years.On the basis of chironomid and diatom assemblage changes, and supported by sediment chemical data and historical information, we distinguished two main phases in lake evolution. Before 1926 the lake was dominated by chironomids belonging to Micropsectra insignilobus-type and benthic diatoms suggesting well-oxygenated oligotrophic environment with only small-scale disturbance. We considered this state as the lake's safe operational space. After 1926 significant changes occurred: Tanytarsus lugens-type and T. mendax-type chironomids took over dominance and collector filterers increased until 1970 pointing to an increase in available nutrients. The diatom community showed the most pronounced change between 1950 and 1992 when planktonic diatoms increased. The highest trophic level was reconstructed between 1970 and 1992, while the indicator species of increasing nutrient availability, Asterionella formosa spread from 1982 and decreased rapidly at 1992. Statistical analyses evidenced that the main driver of the diatom community change was atmospheric reactive nitrogen (Nr) fertilization that drastically moved the community towards planktonic diatom dominance from 1950. The transformation of the chironomid community was primarily driven by summer mean temperature increase that also changed the dominant feeding guild from collector gatherers to collector falterers. Our results overall suggest that the speed of ecosystem reorganisation showed an unprecedented increase over the last 100 years; biological systems in many cases underwent threshold type changes, while several system components displayed non-hysteretic change between alternating community composition. We conclude that Lake Balea is outside of its safe operating space today. The main trigger of changes since 1926 was climate change and human impact acting synergically. (C) 2020 The Authors.

The study was conducted during spring in the of the oligomesotrophic Lake Pavin and the eutrophic Lake Aydat, France. Pico- and nano-DOP were abundant (10(5)-10(8) particles L-1) and exhibited significant variations in morphometric characteristics and numerical density within and among lakes, which is consistent with comparable studies known mostly from marine systems. Surface area and abundance of pico- and nano-DYP and nano-TEP were significantly higher in Lake Aydat than in Lake Pavin. Both these variables significantly increased with chlorophyll a concentration and the abundance of total heterotrophic bacteria. Bacterial colonization of DOP was highly related to the nature of the particle. Attached bacterial counts were on the order of 10(7)-10(8) bacteria L-1, representing 1-17% of the total bacterial counts. Overall, we conclude that nonliving particulate organic matter are ubiquitous and abundantly occurring components in lakes where, at least, they serve as support for the attachment and as Substrate for the metabolism of bacteria. the latter role being likely dependent on the composition of the particles and the trophic Status of the milieu.					; Sime-Ngando, Télesphore/M-4134-2019; Carrias, Jean-François/AAT-2738-2021	Sime-Ngando, Telesphore/0000-0002-7240-5803; Carrias, Jean-Francois/0000-0002-6201-1544; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				JUL	2002	47	4					1202	1209		10.4319/lo.2002.47.4.1202	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2002.47.4.1202													WOS:000176931700027
J	SMEDMAN, AS; BERGSTROM, H				SMEDMAN, AS; BERGSTROM, H			AN EXPERIMENTAL-STUDY OF STABLY STRATIFIED FLOW IN THE LEE OF HIGH MOUNTAINS	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												A complex flow situation over a frozen lake during winter in the northern part of Sweden during 1987 and 1989 has been studied. The high mountains on the order of 1100 m surrounding the lake dominate the flow, which can be characterized by three regimes. For very stable stratification (Froude number less than 1) blocking occurs on the upwind slope of the mountains, while in the lee there are calm wind conditions. Second, for less stable stratification the wind blows down the slope of the mountains at all levels. When there is an uplifted inversion with near neutral stratification below, a recirculation flow pattern occurs in the lower part of the boundary layer. Third, for slightly stable stratification and with a pressure gradient oriented along the lake, a mesoscale flow pattern will create strong ''gap winds'' near the surface, preferably from an easterly direction. One case has near-surface winds of 30 m s(-1). At higher levels, a turbulent wake with very low mean wind speed will be present. The wake oscillates vertically and interacts with the flow in the surface layer. The layer near the ground is thus characterized by alternating periods with high wind speed and low turbulence and with low wind speed and high turbulence.																			0027-0644					AUG	1995	123	8					2319	2333		10.1175/1520-0493(1995)123<2319:AESOSS>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0493(1995)123<2319:AESOSS>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1995RK48000004

Mount Nemrut, situated to the west of Lake Van is one of the main volcanic centers in the region, with a spectacular summit caldera 8.5 x 7 km in diameter. The most recent eruptions of the volcano were in 1441, 1597 and 1692. Nemrut Lake covers the western half of the caldera; it is a deep, half-bowl-shaped lake with a maximum depth of 176 m. Numerous eruption centers are exposed within the caldera as a consequence of magma-water interaction. Current activity of Nemrut caldera is revealed as hot springs, fumaroles and a small, hot lake. Self-potential and bathymetric surveys carried out in the caldera were used to characterize the structure of the caldera and the associated hydrothermal fluid circulation. In addition, analyses based on digital elevation models and satellite imagery were used to improve our knowledge about the structure of the caldera. According to SP results, the flanks of the volcano represent "the hydrogeologic zone", whereas the intra-caldera region is an "active hydrothermal area" where the fluid circulation is controlled by structural discontinuities. There is also a northern fissure zone which exhibits hydrothermal signatures. Nemrut caldera collapsed piecemeal, with three main blocks. Stress controlling the collapse mechanism seems to be highly affected by the regional neotectonic regime. In addition to the historical activity, current hydrothermal and hydrogeologic conditions in the caldera, in which there is a large lake and shallow water table, increase the risk of the quiescent volcano.

Electrofishing Encounter Probability, Survival, and Dispersal of Stocked Age-0 Muskellunge in Wisconsin Lakes	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Boat electrofishing is often used to sample age-0 Muskellunge Esox masquinongy for indexing recruitment or evaluating stocking success. However, electrofishing samples typically result in low CPUE, prompting concerns regarding whether catch rates reflect actual abundance or whether boat electrofishing is generally ineffective for capturing age-0 Muskellunge (i.e., if fish are not being encountered by the gear). To address these concerns, we used radiotelemetry to evaluate the probability of encountering stocked age-0 Muskellunge (230-350 mm TL) during standardized fall electrofishing surveys in three Wisconsin lakes. Our approach also allowed us to evaluate short-term survival and dispersal from stocking locations. Despite limited dispersal (<2.5 km) from the stocking locations and relatively high short-term survival (75-94%) of radio-tagged fish, few age-0 Muskellunge were located within the path of the electrofishing boat (7-30%). Furthermore, the probability of encounter by boat electrofishing varied by as much as 6.3 times among lakes. Differences in encounter probability among lakes appeared to be related to lake basin and habitat characteristics. Overlays of electrofishing sampling effort and fish locations revealed that traditional shoreline electrofishing may not be an effective way of estimating age-0 Muskellunge CPUE. Modifications to electrofishing protocols, including increased effort in offshore areas and consideration of basin characteristics and habitat, may be needed to increase encounter probabilities and the utility of boat electrofishing for sampling age-0 Muskellunge.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				APR	2020	40	2					383	393		10.1002/nafm.10418	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.10418		MAR 2020											WOS:000520714400001

Common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) are the most abundant fishes in the SGR. A total of 48 common and silver carps (24 each) were captured randomly, using 50 x 6 m gill net (mesh size: 5 x 5 cm) during July to December 2009. Each month, the levels of accumulated total mercury (T-Hg) in white muscle, red muscle and liver tissues of these fishes were measured using an Advanced Mercury Analyzer (Model; Leco 254 AMA, USA) on the dry weight basis. There were no statistically significant differences between T-Hg concentrations in white muscle, red muscle and liver in common carp in comparison with similar tissues in silver carp (P> 0.05). The content of T-Hg in liver tissue of both species was lower than of white and red muscle tissues. Higher levels of accumulated T-Hg were observed during summer. Results showed that T-Hg concentrations in common and silver carps target tissues were strongly dependent on age, length and weight (P < 0.05). The results indicated that the levels of accumulated T-Hg in tissues of all samples with weights of over 850 g were greater than those limits established by WHO and FAO (500 ng g(-1)).

J	Mataloni, G; Vinocur, A; Pinto, PD				Mataloni, G; Vinocur, A; Pinto, PD			Abiotic characterization and epilithic communities of a naturally enriched stream at Cierva Point, Antarctic Peninsula	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												Pinguinera Stream is one of the two main lotic environments of Cierva Point (Antarctic Specially Protected Area No. 134) on the Danco Coast, Antarctic Peninsula. It originates in a large snowfield, flows through a penguin rookery, moss and grass banks, discharging into Cierva Cove. During late Antarctic summer 2003, we sampled the stream at six locations along its course. Abiotic features characterize it as a clear water system, yet receiving a very high amount of PO4-P and NH4-N from the rookery. These nutrients decrease downstream mainly due to uptake by epilithic algae and oxidation of NH4+ to NO3-, consequently lowering pH and dissolved O-2, which was always under-saturated. Strong correlations between all these parameters support these findings. The epilithic algal community shows both temporal and spatial changes in biomass, composition and relative frequencies. Dominant species at the higher reach of the stream are cyanobacteria, mainly Chamaesiphon subglobosus (Rostafinski) Lemm. and a mesh of Leptolyngbya spp. filaments. The chlorophyta Prasiola calophylla (Carmich.) Menegh. dominates the community in oxygenated, fast-flowing reaches. Comparison with the other main stream from Cierva Point, which is not influenced by the rookery, shows that growth and survival of the epilithic community in this area is limited by factors other than nutrient concentrations.

J	Zhuang, YJ; Kidder, TR				Zhuang, Yijie; Kidder, Tristram R.			Archaeology of the Anthropocene in the Yellow River region, China, 8000-2000 cal. BP	HOLOCENE												Although archaeological analysis emphasizes the importance of climatic events as a driver of historical processes, we use a variety of environmental and archaeological data to show that human modification of the environment was a significant factor in shaping the early history of the Yellow River region of North China. Humans began to modify site-specific and local-level environments in the Early Holocene (similar to 11,500-7000BP). By the Mid-Holocene (similar to 7000-5000BP), the effects of humans on the environment become much larger and are witnessed at regional and tributary river basin scales. Land clearance and agriculture, as well as related land use, are dominant determinants of these changes. By the Late Neolithic to Early Bronze Age (similar to 5000-3500BP), population growth and intensification of agricultural production expanded the human footprint across the Yellow River region. By the Mid to Late Bronze Age (similar to 3600-2200BP), larger populations armed with better technology and propelled by more centralized governments were altering lands throughout the Yellow River region, gradually bringing the environment under human control. By the Early Dynastic period (221 bc-ad 220), the Yellow River region was an increasingly anthropogenic environment wherein human land management practices were, in many instances, as consequential as natural forces. Throughout the Holocene history of the Middle and Lower Yellow River, anthropogenic, climatic, and natural environmental processes were acting to shape human history and behavior, making it difficult, if not impossible, to say whether human or climate processes were more consequential. There is a complex relationship in China's early history between natural and human forcing much like there is today. The Early Anthropocene concept is useful here because it recognizes that when natural and cultural forces become so intertwined, it no longer makes sense to separate the two.																			0959-6836	1477-0911				NOV	2014	24	11					1602	1623		10.1177/0959683614544058	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683614544058													WOS:000343978500018
J	Rueda, F; Schladow, G				Rueda, Francisco; Schladow, Geoffrey			Mixing and stratification in lakes of varying horizontal length scales: Scaling arguments and energy partitioning	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												This work analyzes the effects that changes in the surface area of stratified lakes have on the partitioning of energy among different pools, and, ultimately, on the strength of thermal stratification. Proposed restoration plans for the Salton Sea ( USA), the surface area of which could be reduced by 80%, provided the original motivation of this work. Scaling arguments, based on a one-dimensional model of lake stratification and three-dimensional simulations, are consistent in predicting weaker mixing for smaller lakes. It is demonstrated that energy partitioning is affected by geometry for lakes that have a quarter internal wave period (T-i/4) that is shorter than the duration of wind forcing events, Delta t(w). In these cases, it is demonstrated that mixing is, in general, stronger in larger basins due to greater mechanical energy fluxes across the free surface; larger shear production of turbulent kinetic energy E-tk; and a larger fraction of E-tk becoming background potential energy through diapycnal mixing. All these variables scale with the length of the basin. In lakes where T-i/4 > Delta t(w), the rates of exchange among the different energy pools and the magnitudes of these pools are not sensitive to changes in lake size. Our results suggest that stratification in the reduced Salton Sea will be stronger than in the lake as it exists today, mainly in late summer. It is during that time when, due to high insolation values, stratification becomes strong and T-i/4 in the reduced sea will likely become small in comparison with the diurnal winds.

Structure and parameter uncertainty in centennial projections of forest community structure and carbon cycling	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Secondary forest regrowth shapes community succession and biogeochemistry for decades, including in the Upper Great Lakes region. Vegetation models encapsulate our understanding of forest function, and whether models can reproduce multi-decadal succession patterns is an indication of our ability to predict forest responses to future change. We test the ability of a vegetation model to simulate C cycling and community composition during 100 years of forest regrowth following stand-replacing disturbance, asking (a) Which processes and parameters are most important to accurately model Upper Midwest forest succession? (b) What is the relative importance of model structure versus parameter values to these predictions? We ran ensembles of the Ecosystem Demography model v2.2 with different representations of processes important to competition for light. We compared the magnitude of structural and parameter uncertainty and assessed which sub-model-parameter combinations best reproduced observed C fluxes and community composition. On average, our simulations underestimated observed net primary productivity (NPP) and leaf area index (LAI) after 100 years and predicted complete dominance by a single plant functional type (PFT). Out of 4,000 simulations, only nine fell within the observed range of both NPP and LAI, but these predicted unrealistically complete dominance by either early hardwood or pine PFTs. A different set of seven simulations were ecologically plausible but under-predicted observed NPP and LAI. Parameter uncertainty was large; NPP and LAI ranged from similar to 0% to >200% of their mean value, and any PFT could become dominant. The two parameters that contributed most to uncertainty in predicted NPP were plant-soil water conductance and growth respiration, both unobservable empirical coefficients. We conclude that (a) parameter uncertainty is more important than structural uncertainty, at least for ED-2.2 in Upper Midwest forests and (b) simulating both productivity and plant community composition accurately without physically unrealistic parameters remains challenging for demographic vegetation models.

One of the segments is the Sumani segment in the province of West Sumatra that passes through a relatively densely populated area. Knowing the geometry of subsurface structures in this segment is one of the efforts to identify potential disasters in the future. To achieve this objective, ground magnetic measurements were carried out and the data were combined with Bouguer anomaly map. Magnetic susceptibility and density were also measured on hand samples collected during the survey so that their values could serve as initial parameters for modeling. The modeling and interpretation stages are carried out through joint forward modeling magnetics and gravity. The equivalent depth of the magnetic and gravity models built under the surface is 20 km. The magnetic and gravity modeling identify several intrusive bodies that do not reach the surface, including one beneath Lake Singkarak. Several slivers of Permian metamorphic rocks encased in the basement rocks were also identified. These unexposed intrusive bodies and slivers of encased metamorphic rocks are probably quite common in the GSF. The magnetic and gravity modeling with 2D modeling also infers an 18 km displacement in Lake Singkarak based on displacement of Quaternary colluvium volcanic deposits. Based on the presence of hot spring at the end of Sumani segment, the pull-apart pattern occurred in Lake Singkarak share similarities with that occur in another segment of GSF, namely Tarutung.					; Dahrin, Darharta/JHU-3191-2023; Nugraha, Andri/Q-9135-2016; Arisbaya, Ilham/B-3497-2017; Bijaksana, Satria/I-4683-2013	Bijaksana, Satria/0000-0001-6374-4128; Suryanata, Putu Billy/0000-0001-6701-2311; Arisbaya, Ilham/0000-0001-6372-8478; 													0040-1951	1879-3266				DEC 20	2021	821								229149	10.1016/j.tecto.2021.229149	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tecto.2021.229149		NOV 2021											WOS:000721721600008

Aeolian stratigraphy describes ice-age paleoenvironments in unglaciated Arctic Alaska	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Terrestrial paleoenvironmental records with high dating resolution extending into the last ice age are rare from the western Arctic. Such records can test the synchronicity and extent of ice-age climatic events and define how Arctic landscapes respond to rapid climate changes. Here we describe the stratigraphy and sedimentology of a yedoma deposit in Arctic Alaska (the Carter Section) dating to between 37,000 and 9000 calibrated radiocarbon years BP (37-9 ka) and containing detailed records of loess and sand-sheet sedimentation, soil development, carbon storage, and permafrost dynamics. Alternation between sand-sheet and loess deposition provides a proxy for the extent and activity of the Ikpikpuk Sand Sea (ISS), a large dune field located immediately upwind. Warm, moist interstadial times (ca. 37, 36.3-32.5, and 15-13 ka) triggered floodplain aggradation, permafrost thaw, reduced loess deposition, increased vegetation cover, and rapid soil development accompanied by enhanced carbon storage. During the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, ca. 28-18 ka), rapid loess deposition took place on a landscape where vegetation was sparse and non-woody. The most intense aeolian activity occurred after the LGM between ca. 18 and 151 a when sand sheets fringing the ISS expanded over the site, possibly in response to increasingly droughty conditions as summers warmed and active layers deepened. With the exception of this lagged LGM response, the record of aeolian activity at the Carter Section correlates with other paleoenvironmental records from unglaciated Siberia and Alaska. Overall, rapid shifts in geomorphology, soils, vegetation, and permafrost portray an ice-age landscape where, in contrast to the Holocene, environmental change was chronic and dominated by aeolian processes.

Theodore			Clostridium botulinum type E in Lake Erie: Inter-annual differences and role of benthic invertebrates	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Outbreaks of type E botulism have affected fish and waterfowl in Lake Erie since 1998. We compared conditions in the eastern basin during a warm outbreak year (2002) and a cooler year with low mortality (2003) to determine the levels of Clostridium botulinum type E spore DNA present in sediments under both scenarios. Lake Erie warmed up earlier in 2002 with a mean summer temperature 2 degrees C higher than in 2003. A comparison between both years indicated that in 2002 there were anoxic episodes near the sediment and a decrease in redox potential and pH, conditions that favor C botulinum growth. We found that in 2002, sediments were also warmer and contained more spores than in 2003. To determine the biotic sources of botulism for predators, we analyzed the benthic fauna for spore DNA. Benthic organisms (chironomids, oligochetes, nematodes, dreissenids and mayflies) carried higher levels of spores than sediments, and chironomids contained some of the highest levels reaching 820,000 copies DNA/mg. Dreissenid mussel tissue contained up to 2280 copies DNA/mg and their waste deposits had up to 275 copies DNA/mg. We conclude that there are numerous benthic pathways to transmit type E botulism to upper trophic levels given the right conditions. We present in this manuscript a hypothesis on the interplay of environmental conditions and the risk of outbreaks of type E botulism in the eastern basin of Lake Erie.

HYDROBIOLOGIA												A mesocosm experiment in 24 enclosures (6 m(3)) started at the end of June 1996 in a highly eutrophic shallow lake, Lake Koylionjarvi (SW Finland). The original factorial design with nutrient, fish and macrophyte treatments was lost due to strong winds causing leakages. However, after the walls were made leak-proof again on July 11, the planktonic communities developed in divergent ways. On July 31 there was a tenfold variation in total crustacean biomass among the enclosures and the lake (40.2-417.5 mug C l(-1)), and chlorophyll a varied from 9.5 to 67.0 mug l(-1). Here, the single-day data on the 25 planktonic communities is analysed by means of correlation and factor analysis in order to identify factors controlling the protozoans, with particular emphasis on ciliates. The data set comprised: total phosphorus, nitrogen, chlorophyll, bacteria, autotrophic picoplankton, heterotrophic flagellates, abundance and species composition of ciliates, phytoplankton and metazooplankton. The results indicate that although the total ciliate abundance (ranging from 16.2 to 95.0 ind l(-1)) was controlled by food resources, the observed differences in ciliate community structure could be attributed partly to differential predation by metazooplankton. The effect of Daphnia cucullata, the dominant daphnid cladoceran, was stronger than that of other metazoans.

These introductions have caused a reduced transparency, decreasing submerged vegetation and population decline of native tench (Tinca tinca). Alien species were caught and removed for 76 days in 2014 and 2015 with the objectives of eradicating carp and reducing largemouth bass and pumpkinseed populations under 20% of 2014 observed density and biomass. Only two individuals of tench were captured, underlining its scarcity. A total of 27,077 individuals (1089 kg) of alien species were removed, but eradication was not achieved for any species. The largest sizes of carp and largemouth bass almost disappeared, while in 2015 an increase in the abundance of large recruits was observed. A hydroacoustic fish stock assessment was carried out at the end of the action in 2015 to obtain data on fish density and biomass in open water as a mean to compare results to measurements from 2010. Although the density of fish increased from 2010 to 2015, biomass fell drastically. In 2017, the alien species community was controlled again, revealing a substantial recovery from previous control efforts, a change in the size distribution towards smaller specimens and interactions among North American species. Additionally, no tench could be identified and the species is considered locally extinct. Thus, the results from this study suggest the need for ongoing control efforts with increased electrofishing and implementation of alternative control methods such as the introduction of biological control agents to achieve the ecological status improvement and environmental restoration goals.

J	Hume, JMB; Shortreed, KS; Morton, KF				Hume, JMB; Shortreed, KS; Morton, KF			Juvenile sockeye rearing capacity of three lakes in the Fraser River system	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												We used three methods to estimate sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) escapements that maximize production (S-MAX) in Fraser River lakes: (i) effective female spawners and adult returns using Ricker stock-recruit analysis (SR models), (ii) effective female spawners and fall fry or smelts (fry models), and (iii) photosynthetic rates (PR model), a modification of an Alaskan sockeye production model (EV model). Adult SR models were not useful in predicting S-MAX because of high variability in Shuswap and Chilko lakes (r(2) < 11%) and because of linearity in Quesnel Lake. Fry models using Ricker stock-recruit analysis provided S-MAX escapements of 0.90, 1.38, and 1.06 million for Quesnel, Shuswap, and Chilko lakes but were still highly variable (r(2) < 51%). Fry data indicated that fry numbers did not increase above escapements of 0.85, 1.5, and 0.51 million to Quesnel, Shuswap, and Chilko lakes. PR model predictions of S-MAX escapements to Quesnel, Shuswap, and Chilko lakes of 1.06, 1.85, and 0.62 million were similar to escapements that first produced maximum observed fry numbers. While fry models provide a direct estimate of rearing capacity, many years of data are required to generate a relationship for any lake. The PR model appears to be a useful predictor of rearing capacity and predictions can be made after 1-2 years.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				APR	1996	53	4					719	733		10.1139/cjfas-53-4-719	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-53-4-719													WOS:A1996VD06300005
J	Anda, A; Soos, G; Teixeira da Silva, JA; Kozma-Bognar, V				Anda, Angela; Soos, Gabor; Teixeira da Silva, Jaime A.; Kozma-Bognar, Veronika			Regional evapotranspiration from a wetland in Central Europe, in a 16-year period without human intervention	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Regional evapotranspiration (ET) for Feneki "Pond" (FP, Kis-Balaton wetland, Hungary) was estimated using weighted canopy areas of five macrophyte classes and open water over an uninterrupted period without any human intervention between 1997 and 2012. In addition to the dominant common reed (Phragmites australis), the cover ratio of the other four plant groups and open water was monitored. The different cover categories of the wetland were separated using images with surface interpretation using the maximum likelihood classification method. Although the annual cover ratio for any class only changed slightly by 1-2%, this wetland was not considered to be in equilibrium, since species turnover (sedge-grass) was observed during this study. Reference ET was calculated by the widely accepted Penman-Monteith (FAO-56) formula from the data of a nearby climate station. Of the five macrophyte classes studied, crop coefficients (as the ratio of measured and reference ET) of three groups were measured locally with a lysimeter. To process the 16-year long ET time series, the means of six-season long K-c values were applied. As the open water of FP was frequently covered by seaweed (Ceratophyllum demersum), a special evaporation (E) was defined using seaweed settled "A" pans. Compared to evaporation of standard "A" pan, the seasonal average evaporation was 7% higher in "A" pans containing seaweed (C. demersum). Annual and seasonal mean ET totals fluctuated depending on environmental conditions (air temperature) and the type of macrophyte. The range of macrophytes' 16-year annual mean ET varied from 876.8 +/- 154.58 mm year(-1) (dominant common reed) to 662.8 +/- 41.57 mm year(-1) (woody deciduous, Salix fragilis, Alnus glutinosa, Populus tremula) with a weighting average of 802.1 +/- 50.4 mm year(-1) for the regional ET of FP. The average winter ET sum was 17.1 +/- 1.19% with a range of 15.7 +/- 1.09-20.7 +/- 1.43% for common reed and woody deciduous, respectively. The annual mean ET totals were highly correlated with mean daily ET rates of different macrophyte classes. Seasonal daily average ET rates of different macrophyte classes varied between 4.0 +/- 0.26 mm day(-1) and 2.9 +/- 0.19 mm day(-1) in common reed and woody deciduous, respectively. The long-term weighted daily mean ET rate for FP was 3.6 +/- 0.24 mm day(-1). The highest ET/E ratio of 1.09 was for common reed, in an agreement with previous observations, but was lowest in woody deciduous (0.81). In addition to classic statistical approaches, monthly ET data were also used for modeling purposes (ARIMA models). The projected monthly regional ET values supported earlier observed seasonal patterns likely due to peculiarities in wetland water supply. Instead of exclusively using dominant species to estimate regional ET, more accurate results were possible by extending the ET approach to include several macrophyte species. Neglecting the smaller-scale differences in macrophyte, ET could cause more than a 10% overestimation in the regional ET sum. The SARIMA(1,0,0)(0,1,1)(12) model contributed positively to the existing information about the ET of the study site. The projected monthly regional ET values retained the earlier observed seasonal pattern until 2020. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J	Bourquin, S; Guillocheau, F; Péron, S				Bourquin, S.; Guillocheau, F.; Peron, S.			Braided rivers within an arid alluvial plain (example from the Lower Triassic, western German Basin): recognition criteria and expression of stratigraphic cycles	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Based on a detailed sedimentological analysis of Lower Triassic continental deposits in the western Germanic sag Basin (i.e. the eastern part of the present-day Paris Basin: the 'Conglomerat basal', 'Gres vosgien' and 'Conglomerat principal' Formations), three main depositional environments were identified: (i) braided rivers in an arid alluvial plain with some preserved aeolian dunes and very few floodplain deposits; (ii) marginal erg (i.e. braided rivers, aeolian dunes and aeolian sand-sheets); and (iii) playa lake (an ephemeral lake environment with fluvial and aeolian sediments). Most of the time, aeolian deposits in arid environments that are dominated by fluvial systems are poorly preserved and particular attention should be paid to any sedimentological marker of aridity, such as wind-worn pebbles (ventifacts), sand-drift surfaces and aeolian sand-sheets. In such arid continental environments, stratigraphic surfaces of allocyclic origin correspond to bounding surfaces of regional extension. Elementary stratigraphic cycles, i.e. the genetic units, have been identified for the three main continental environments: the fluvial type, fluvial-aeolian type and fluvial/playa lake type. At the time scale of tens to hundreds of thousands of years, these high-frequency cycles of climatic origin are controlled either by the groundwater level in the basin or by the fluvial siliciclastic sediment input supplied from the highland. Lower Triassic deposits from the Germanic Basin are preserved mostly in endoreic basins. The central part of the basin is arid but the rivers are supplied with water by precipitation falling on the remnants of the Hercynian (Variscan)-Appalachian Mountains. Consequently, a detailed study of alluvial plain facies provides indications of local climatic conditions in the place of deposition, whereas fluvial systems only reflect climatic conditions of the upstream erosional catchments.

In this study, we investigated the humidity evolution pattern in the North China Plain (NCP) during the early-to-middle Holocene by employing principal component analysis on 93 fossil spectra. Furthermore, by integrating the Regional Estimates of Vegetation Abundance from Large Sites (REVEALS) model, we quantitatively reconstructed the process of vegetation succession and discussed vegetation response to climate change events. Our results indicate that the sample scores of the first principal component axis (PCA axis 1) exhibited a consistent negative bias, implying a gradual rise in regional humidity. The quantitatively reconstructed tree coverage was found to be lower than the uncorrected pollen proportions, while the coverage of herb plants showed a significant increase compared to their respective pollen percentages. In the early and middle Holocene, the vegetation of the NCP succeeded from meadow steppe (10,000 - 8,100 cal yr B.P.) to meadow steppe with pine woodland patches (8,100 - 7,100 cal yr B.P.), then to pine forest (7,100 - 5,300 cal yr B.P.). The quantitatively reconstructed vegetation exhibited the most pronounced response to 8.2 ka climate event, with Asteraceae emerging as the dominant taxa. Furthermore, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the impact of the 8.2 ka climate event on vegetation in northern China, identifying four distinct types of vegetation feedback: (1) negligible alterations in vegetation, (2) expansion of steppe or desert steppe, (3) proliferation of temperate tree species, and (4) augmentation of meadow steppe.

J	Hoff, MH; Bronte, CR				Hoff, MH; Bronte, CR			Structure and stability of the midsummer fish communities in Chequamegon Bay, Lake Superior, 1973-1996	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												We analyzed the structure and stability of the summer fish communities of Chequamegon Bay, Lake Superior, during 1973-1996 from data collected with bottom trawls at 39 stations. Fifty-three taxa were collected during the study, but we found that relative abundances for 20 taxa described most of the internal variability of the data for all taxa. Abundance data for the 20 species showed that two communities existed in the bay; one inhabited shallow water (less than or equal to 3.0 m) whereas the other inhabited deeper water (>3.0 m). No temporal patterns of change were found in the structure of the shallow-water community, whose variation was best described by abundances of 12 taxa. The deepwater community, whose variation was best described by eight taxa, underwent three periods of stability; 1973-1978, 1979-1988, and 1989-1996. We conclude that the shallow-water community was stable throughout the 24 years studied. Dynamics of the deepwater community were greatly affected by changes in stocking rates of lake trout Salvelinus namaycush and splake (hybrid of brook trout S. fontinalis X lake trout) and by rehabilitation of populations of lake herring Coregonus artedi and lake whitefish C. clupeaformis information on the existence, structure, stability, and habitats of fish communities in the bay will be useful for assessing changes in those communities that result from further changes in the bay or lake ecosystems.																			0002-8487					MAR	1999	128	2					362	373		10.1577/1548-8659(1999)128<0362:SASOTM>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1999)128<0362:SASOTM>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000081212900013

Superficial alteration mineralogy in active volcanic systems: An example of Pods volcano, Costa Rica	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH					Fall Meeting of the American-Geophysical-Union (AGU)	DEC 14-18, 2015	San Francisco, CA	Amer Geophys Union				The alteration mineralogy in the crater area of Poas volcano (Costa Rica) has been studied to constrain acid fluid rock interaction processes and conditions relevant for the formation of sulphate-bearing mineral assemblages found on the surface of Mars. Individual sub-environments, which include the hyperacid lake (Laguna Caliente), ephemeral hot springs, fumarole vents and areas affected by acid rain and/or spray from the lake, are marked by distinct secondary mineral associations, with sulphates commonly as prevailing component. The sulphates occur in a wide mineralogical diversity comprising gypsum/anhydrite, various polyhydrated Al-sulphates, alunitejarosite group minerals, halotrichite-, voltaite- and copiapite-group minerals, epsomite and romerite. Depending on the sub-environment, they are variably associated with clay minerals (kaolinite-group and smectite-group), zeolites, SiO2-polymorphs, Fe-(hydro)oxides, Ti-oxides, native sulphur, sulphides, chlorides, fluorides, phosphates and carbonates. Geochemical modelling was performed to identify mechanisms responsible for the formation of the secondary minerals found in the field, and to predict their possible stability under conditions not seen at the surface. The results indicate that the appearance of amorphous silica, hematite, anhydrite/gypsum, pyrite, anatase and kaolinite is relatively insensitive to the degree of acidity of the local aqueous system. On the other hand, alunite-jarosite group minerals, elemental sulphur and Al(OH)SO4 only form under acidic conditions (pH < 4). The presence of polyhydrated Mg- and Fe2+ -sulphates is restricted to olivine-bearing rocks exposed to acid rain or brine spray. Modelling suggests that their formation required a repetitive sequence of olivine dissolution and evaporation in an open system involving limited amounts of fluid. The mineral variety in the crater of Poas is remarkably similar to sulphate-bearing assemblages considered to be the product of acid-sulphate alteration on Mars. The analogy suggests that comparable fluid-rock interaction controls operated in Martian volcanic environments. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Girjatowicz, JP				Girjatowicz, JP			Ice conditions in coastal lakes of the southern Baltic Sea	ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												This paper describes spatio-temporal variability of the basic ice condition parameters, relationships between selected lakes in terms of those parameters, and frequency of fast (ice cover) and floating ice. Attention is also paid to morphology and topography of ice cover in lakes Jamno, Bukowo, Gardno, and Lebsko during 1960/61-1999/2000. Based on data archived at the Institute of Meteorology and Water Management, the following ice parameters were analysed: date of the first ice appearance; date of the first ice cover formation, date of disintegration of the last ice cover, date of disappearance of the last ice, ice season duration, number of days with ice, number of days with ice cover, ice conditions continuity, and maximum ice thickness in winter. Lakes Jamno and Bukowo, located in the western part of the Polish coast, are characterised by milder ice conditions, compared to the more eastward lakes (the Gardno and the Lebsko). Ice parameters were found to correlate closely, with statistical significance exceeding alpha = 0.01 and correlation coefficients usually higher than 0.90, between individual lakes, particularly the neighbouring ones. The highest frequencies of fast and floating ice, 70-75 % and about 10 %, respectively (altogether more than 80 %), were recorded in the last pentacle of January. Fast ice (ice cover), accounting for 80 % of all the ice types, was found to dominate in the lakes studied; fast ice domination is typical of small and shallow water bodies. Ice cover is formed as a result of uniform increase in ice rind thickness. After the fast ice has decayed, an ice field pushed by the wind may form ice piles rising to a few metres above the water surface. At the beginning of the ice season, the piled ice appears most often on the western and northern shores, while at the end of the season it tends to stay on the eastern shores. The processes, associated with the presence of piled ice on the shore, are destructive not only for the shore, but also for constructions deployed within the ice range. The ice piles also affect transport and accumulation of sediment, mainly in the shore zone.																			0003-4088						2003	39	4					317	331		10.1051/limn/2003026	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/2003026													WOS:000187735000004

Dune migration rates can be studied to draw conclusions of changing wind conditions over time. The Gonghe Basin (GB), located on the north-eastern Tibetan Plateau (TP), offers a good testing ground for these assumptions. The intramontane basin is highly influenced by two major wind regimes: the mid-latitude Westerlies and the East Asian summer monsoon. To investigate environmental changes, this study combines optical remote sensing techniques with climatic datasets. High-resolution satellite images of the last five decades, such as CORONA KH-4B, are used to map dunes and calculate their respective migration rates. Further, height information was extracted as well. Climatic changes from the ERA-5 reanalysis dataset and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values were processed alongside. Relating the dunes' surface processes to climate model data shows an accordance between slowing migration, expanding vegetation and a decrease in sand drift potential. From 1968 to present time, an average dune migration rate of 7.3 m a(-1) was extracted from the satellite images, with an overall reduction of -1.81 m a(-1). The resultant drift potential (RDP) values for the GB are calculated to be below 10 m(3) s(-3) with a spatial decrease, following a direction from the NW to the SE, fitting well with a corresponding decrease in the migration rates. Our results indicate a good agreement between the development of aeolian landforms and the ERA-5 climate reanalysis model data, even in a high-altitude setting with complex topography, which is known to influence such datasets.					; Baas, Andreas/C-2683-2013; Stauch, Georg/O-2776-2013; Lehmkuhl, Frank/B-9671-2008; Walk, Janek/Y-7342-2018	Dorwald, Lukas/0000-0002-4022-9665; Delobel, Lucie Amanda/0000-0002-9144-8526; Lehmkuhl, Frank/0000-0002-6876-7377; Stauch, Georg/0000-0002-8046-140X; Baas, Andreas/0000-0001-9305-5868; Zhang, Deguo/0000-0003-3029-038X; Walk, Janek/0000-0002-3283-7214													0197-9337	1096-9837				OCT	2023	48	13					2613	2629		10.1002/esp.5651	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/esp.5651		AUG 2023											WOS:001048807800001

Heterogeneous changes in the surface area of lakes in the Kangerlussuaq area of southwestern Greenland between 1995 and 2017	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Global climate change has increased temperatures and precipitation in the Arctic throughout the past thirty years. Lakes across the Arctic have demonstrated spatially and temporally variable trends in size and number because of these climate changes. Modifications in the hydrological budget and surface hydrology of Arctic regions have important implications for aquatic ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles. Since 1960 the ice-free region of southwestern Greenland (between Sisimiut, Kangerlussuaq, and the ice margin) has experienced temperature increases, while precipitation has risen at the coast at Sisimiut and has fallen inland at Kangerlussuaq. However, it remains unknown whether the lakes in this region have responded to these temperature and precipitation changes. Therefore, the surface area of 186 lakes was calculated from Landsat imagery for 1995, 2002, 2015, 2016, and 2017 to establish whether lakes in this region have changed in size during a twenty-two-year period. Lake surface area decreased by 855,449 m(2) between 1995 and 2017. The greatest lake surface area changes occurred between 2002 and 2015, with large variations also between 2015 and 2016. Lakes close to Kangerlussuaq (area 1) demonstrated the greatest loss in lake surface area (-1.40 km(2)). It is proposed that this trend reflects high evaporation totals as a result of increasing temperatures and longer ice-free periods in this area. Lakes close to Sisimiut at the coast (area 2) exhibit a net increase in lake surface area, which could reflect the increase in precipitation experienced in this area during the study period. However, not all lakes in the study areas responded in a uniform manner. These heterogeneous changes in lake surface area may reflect how changes in regional climate are interacting with catchment geomorphology, and highlight the importance of individual catchment and lake characteristics in determining lake response to climatic change in this region.

In predive turtles, and in turtles submerged for up to 150 days, plasma Po-2, Pco(2), pH, [Cl-], [Na+], [K+], total Mg, total Ca, lactate, glucose, and osmolality were measured; hematocrit and body mass were determined, and plasma [HCO3-] was calculated. Turtles in anoxic water developed a severe metabolic acidosis, accumulating lactate from a predive value of 1.7 to 116 mmol/l at 50 days, associated with a fall in pH from 8.010 to 7.128. To buffer lactate increase, total calcium and magnesium rose from 3.5 and 2.0 to 25.7 and 7.6 mmol/l, respectively. Plasma [HCO3-] was titrated from 44.7 to 4.3 mmol/l in turtles in anoxic water. Turtles in normoxic water had only minor disturbances of their acid-base status and ionic statuses; there was a marked increase in hematocrit from 31.1 to 51.9%. This study and field studies suggest that map turtles have an obligatory requirement for a hibernaculum that provides well-oxygenated water (e.g. rivers and large lakes rather than small ponds and swamps) and that this requirement is a major factor in determining their micro distribution.

Based on the field observations and some laboratory experiments, this paper demonstrates that the likely formation reaction of these thiophenes is from chlorophyll-derived phytol and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) via phytadiene intermediates. The reactions of phytol sealed with H2S-saturated seawater, lacustrine freshwater and distilled water all produced two of the three thiophene isomers above. The molecular structure of the thiophenes deter-mined by their mass spectra suggested an incorporation of sulfur into the conjugated s-cis diene moiety of phytadienes, which can be formed by dehydration of phytol. An acid dehydration experiment of phytol in aqueous media yielded four phytadiene isomers. Subsequent reaction of the phytadiene mixtures in the H2S-saturated seawater gave the same two thiophene isomers. These results provided substantial evidence for a mild reaction to produce the limited number of C20 isoprenoid thiophene isomers which occur during the very early stages of diagenesis, not only under saline but also under freshwater conditions. In fact, the three C20 isoprenoid thiophene isomers were identified in the surface sediment of a freshwater lake of low pH owing to the inflow of sulfide-rich hot-spring water (Lake Usori-ko, Japan).																			0146-6380					JAN	1992	18	1					83	91		10.1016/0146-6380(92)90146-O	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0146-6380(92)90146-O													WOS:A1992GV74800010
J	Epele, LB; Archangelsky, M				Epele, Luis B.; Archangelsky, Miguel			Spatial Variations in Water Beetle Communities in Arid and Semi-Arid Patagonian Wetlands and Their Value as Environmental Indicators	ZOOLOGICAL STUDIES												To evaluate spatial variations in aquatic beetle assemblages, 26 Patagonian ponds were sampled during late spring (Dec.). The hydroperiod, hydrology, abiotic features, precipitation, aridity, and aquatic plant richness of the study sites differed. Fifteen physicochemical features were measured, and aquatic plants were collected to determine taxonomic richness. Sampling of the 26 ponds produced 21 aquatic beetle taxa in 6 families. All aquatic beetles (adults and larvae) were assigned to functional feeding groups. A canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was run to assess relationships between aquatic beetle assemblages and environmental variables. Of the variance in aquatic beetle taxa abundances, 23% was accounted for by the 1st 3 ordination axes. Moreover, the 1st 2 canonical axes respectively accounted for 38.2% and 28.4% of the variations attributable to environmental variables (i.e., annual precipitation, elevation, pond area, aquatic plant richness, pH, and conductivity), with conductivity and elevation being the most important. A parsimony analysis was performed to establish which species could define and/or group some of the communities (with sampling sites treated as taxa and species treated as characters). Results of the parsimony analysis suggested that some taxa (Haliplus subseriatus, Gymnochthebius sp., Enochrus darwini, Cyphon sp., Luchoelmis sp., and Rhantus validus) were useful in defining some ponds or groups of ponds. These species can be used as indicators since beetle distributions are not considered to randomly occur. Our findings show that aquatic beetle assemblages can be utilized for wetland conservation planning since in arid and semiarid Patagonia, they are important as water reservoirs and for cattle rearing.																			1021-5506	1810-522X				DEC	2012	51	8					1418	1431																WOS:000208855600017

These concentrations were surprisingly high when considering the scarcity of anthropogenic point sources in the region (Fadini and Jardim, 2001). In order to investigate the role of wet deposition in the mercury biogeochemistry cycle in this basin, Hg deposition was estimated for 18 tributary sub-basins of the Negro river, covering an area of nearly 700,000 km(2). Mercury wet deposition estimate was done by combining analytical data obtained from total Hg measurements in bulk precipitation (8 measurements between 1997 and 2002), Remote Sensoring (RS) and GIS (Geographic Information System) tools, with the help of orbital images from the JERS-1 SAR project (Global Rain Forest Mapping Project, South America- Amazon Basin), Amazon rainfall map (Sombroek, 2001) and SPRING (Geographic information of processing system) from INPE (Brazilian National Institute of Space Research). For each sub-basin, Hg wet deposition flux (ton km(-2) yr(-1)) and the annual amount of Hg (ton yr(-1)) deposited on the area were estimated. The result allowed a clear picture of each sub-basins, by looking for a relation between the wet deposition, the drainage characteristics of each sub-basin and the Hg concentration in the water column.

The bogs are upon fine glacial clay in basins between morainic deposits. The surface layers of the clays contain seed and fruits of aquatic plants. The present associations are of the Ledum-Sphagnum-Picea type. The peat, 8-14 ft. deep, shows the succession from low to high moor. Sphagnum now tends to disappear, being replaced by a later succession with a consequent cessation of peat formation. A detailed account is given of the formation of a calcareous lake with an abundant algal flora in the midst of a high moor by the influx of calcareous springs and the consequent destruction of the Sphagnum associations. The acidity or alkalinity of the water varies in this area from pH of the calcareous lake to pH 7.5 of the Carice-tum at one end of the lake, while the sub-climax muskeg which in some places forms the bank of the lake gives a Ph of 4.5. Analyses of the water of this lake and of the clay underlying the muskeg are given. The action of fire on the sub-climax muskegs is discussed and curves of tree growth from different muskegs are given.																			0022-0477	1365-2745					1926	14						317	341		10.2307/2256023	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2256023													WOS:000200139800013

The influence of elevational differences in absolute maximum density values on regional climate reconstructions	TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION												We found that indiscriminately using tree-ring MXD data with inhomogeneous temporal distribution from different elevations might cause biased chronologies. A mean-adjusting method was developed to overcome this bias. Here we analyse maximum latewood density (MXD) of Pinus sylvestris L. (Scots pine), from deadwood (dry) and subfossil wood (from lakes) collected along an elevation gradient in and close to the central Scandinavian Mountains, in the province of Jamtland, Sweden. Focusing on two common time periods (900-1150 CE and 1300-1550 CE), the mean absolute MXD of deadwood samples showed an inverse relationship with elevation, i.e. the absolute MXD decreases with elevation. However, the MXD values of the subfossil samples did not show such a consistent relationship with elevation. It was also noted that the differences in mean absolute MXD values among sites of different elevations in a given period were larger than among sites of similar elevation between the two time periods, where the former was assumed to be warmer than the latter. Using a theoretical model and a real example, it was shown that indiscriminately using MXD data with inhomogeneous temporal distribution from different elevations may cause biased chronologies, which can have significant effects on subsequent interpretations of past climate variability. A mean-adjusting method was developed to overcome this bias, and its usefulness was demonstrated by comparing two chronologies built on mean-adjusted and unadjusted MXD samples. It was concluded that unadjusted samples from different elevations with inhomogeneous temporal distribution can distort the long-term trend in a final chronology, while this bias can be alleviated if mean-adjusted samples are used.					; Björklund, Jesper/JQW-8461-2023; Linderholm, Hans/N-1020-2013	Bjorklund, Jesper/0000-0003-4238-8173; Linderholm, Hans/0000-0002-1522-8919													0931-1890	1432-2285				AUG	2015	29	4					1259	1271		10.1007/s00468-015-1205-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00468-015-1205-4													WOS:000356876600026

However, studies on the response of phytoplankton in the reservoir-bay to water level fluctuations are very scarce, especially in the highly dynamic reservoir system, for instance, the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) on the Yangtze River in China. Therefore, we carried out weekly monitoring in a typical tributary bay-Xiangxi Bay of the TGR from March 2008 to March 2009, to analyze the dynamics of phytoplankton functional groups, as well as their response to the water level fluctuations and other environmental conditions. The phytoplankton functional groups G (short, nutrient-rich water columns with high light and without nutrient deficiency), M (dielly mixed layers of small eutrophic, low latitude with high insolation and without flushing and low total light) and Lo (summer epilimnia in mesotrophic lakes with segregated nutrients and without prolonged or deep mixing) were the most important in biomass, mainly represented by Pandorina morum and Eudorina elegans, Microcystis aeruginosa, Peridiniopsis niei and Ceratium hirundinella, respectively. The dominant functional groups had close relationships with the water level fluctuations, light and nutrient, etc. Principal components analysis and redundancy analysis indicated that phytoplankton functional groups in Xiangxi Bay were restricted by the mixing regime and other abiotic variables under the influences of the mixing regime. In Xiangxi Bay, the water level fluctuation showed significant correlations with many physicochemical variables, including the mixing depth (r = 0.97, p < 0.001) and the relative water column stability (r = -0.80, p < 0.001). The study implied that water level fluctuations had complex influence on environmental changes and selecting for phytoplankton functional groups in a highly dynamic reservoir-bay. The important characteristics of the dominant phytoplankton functional groups in Xiangxi Bay were also discussed.					; Wang, Lan/AAH-1886-2019; Cai, Qinghua/F-8176-2015; XU, Yaoyang/J-9809-2012	Cai, Qinghua/0000-0002-0224-7256; wang, lan/0000-0001-6843-3003; 													1386-2588	1573-5125				MAY	2011	45	2					197	212		10.1007/s10452-010-9346-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-010-9346-4													WOS:000289300200004

Two new dams could increase average annual hydropower on the Blue Nile River from Lake Tana to Khartoum and the Main Nile River from Khartoum to Aswan by almost 50% (30.2 TWh yr(-1) to 44.7 TWh yr(-1)). A system-wide analysis of the expected financial benefits of various development scenarios reveals little financial justification for substantial irrigation withdrawals upstream of the GERD. Withdrawing 5 billion cubic meters annually upstream of the GERD without additional hydropower development would reduce total average annual hydropower generation on the Blue and Main Nile River by 10.9% (3.3 TWh yr(-1)). If two new dams were constructed upstream of the GERD, withdrawing this volume would cause a 15.2% (6.8 TWh yr(-1)) reduction. 1 and 5 bcm yr(-1) of withdrawals upstream of the three dams would also affect water supply downstream, reducing average annual outflow from Sudan's Merowe Reservoir by 1.1% (0.7 bcm yr(-1)) and 6.2% (4.1 bcm yr(-1)), respectively, and by <1% (0.2 bcm yr(-1)) and 3.3% (1.8 bcm yr(-1)) at Egypt's High Aswan Dam (HAD) Reservoir, respectively. Whilst the annual probability of the HAD storage falling below 60 bcm and invoking its current drought management policy is estimated to currently be 0.085, these two scenarios of upstream withdrawals would increase that annual probability to 0.111 and 0.452 respectively.

J	BOYUM, A				BOYUM, A			LIMNOLOGY AND PALEOLIMNOLOGY OF LAKE NORDVANN, SOUTHEASTERN NORWAY	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Lake Nordvann is in a temperature region and is characterized by non-vigorous mixing, shallow thermocline, low O2 content in the hypolimnion during summer stagnation. Redox potential is lowered below the O2 potential only near the sediments in the last part of the stagnation. In this lake, 3 sediment cores were taken, 2 of them representing the whole post-glacial sedimentation. One was taken at a shallower depth than the other. Chemical (and some physical) analyses showed variation with time in both cores, which were interpreted as widespread climatic changes, cultivation of the land and the start of iron works near the lake. Chlorophyll degradation products indicated high production in an early phase of the lake history and in connection with the cultivation of the land. Stagnant conditions in an early phase of the lake history are probable. On the basis of the concentrations of Fe and Mn and the ratio between them in the 2 longer cores, movement of these elements from shallower to deeper parts of the basin is discussed. The concentration and distribution of P were different in the 2 cores. The main difference was found in a stage where the mineral vivianite is formed in great quantities in the deeper core. This formation and the distribution of P are discussed.																			0003-9136						1976	77	3					277	329																WOS:A1976BV69800002
J	Coats, R; Lewis, J; Schladow, G				Coats, Robert; Lewis, Jack; Schladow, Geoffrey			Projected climate change impacts in the Tahoe Basin: Recent findings from global climate models	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Since 2002, the Tahoe Environmental Research Center has been studying the effects of climate change in the Tahoe Basin. We are using the output from four General Circulation Models downscaled by the method of Localized Constructed Analogues and provided by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO). The daily data were used by SIO to drive the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model and derive a suite of 24 hydrologic and climate variables at a 1/16 (ca. 6 km) grid scale, for two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP 4.5 and 8.5). Here we focus on trends in the return levels of extreme climatic events, including annual maximum daily discharge of six basin streams, maximum and total annual kinetic energy (KE) of raindrops falling on snow-free ground, basin-wide climatic water deficit, and wind speed. To analyze time trends in historic and modeled future extreme values, we applied the program extRemes, based on the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution. Values of KE on snow-free ground were derived by statistically disaggregating daily rainfall to hourly, and using literature values to convert rainfall intensity (mm/hr) for days without snowpack to KE (Joules/m2/hr). We found strong upward trends in extreme values, with most of the effect due to loss of snowpack, but a significant effect of increasing rainfall for one model. To estimate future trends in maximum annual daily discharge of six streams, we adjusted the modeled future annual maximum runoff to the distribution of gage data, using regression of gage data on modeled historic runoff at equal return intervals. The GEV results for the six streams, averaged across the four models, indicate an increase in the 20-year flood of 65-117 percent. Climatic water deficit showed strong upward trends for three of the four models, with a maximum at mid-century for one model. Averaged across the basin and across the four models, average and maximum seasonal winds under RCP 8.5 are projected to decrease slightly in all seasons. The trends in averages and extreme values that we found will have important effects on vegetation, wildfire severity, flood hazards and the clarity of Lake Tahoe.

Our research is based on the freshwater triclads collected at 26 sites in Herzegovina, including 10 rivers, 6 springs and 1 lake. Triclads were collected by hand and with the bait jar with a lid bearing many small perforations. Specimens were identified immediately after being collected or we transported them to the laboratory in termal containers with ice. The morphological features used for species identification in this key are: body coloration (color of the dorsal and ventral side), the size of the pharynx, the presence of tentacles and their location, number and position of the eyes in respect to each other and the body margin, and the shape of the head. Specimens were fixed using Steinmann's fluid and conserved in 70 % alcohol. Inner morphological feature, shape of a penis, was used in determination of Polycelis tenuis and Polycelis nigra. We collected a total of 11 species, belonging to 8 genera (Polycelis Ehrenberg, 1831, Crenobia Kenk, 1930, Phagocata Leidy, 1847 Planaria Midler, 1776, Dendrocoelum Orsted, 1844, Schmidtea Ball, 1974, Dugesia Girard, 1850, Girardia Ball, 1974) and 3 families. The present study forms a baseline for future studies on the diversity and biogeography of Herzegovinian freshwater triclads.

J	Vopel, K; Hawes, I				Vopel, Kay; Hawes, Ian			Photosynthetic performance of benthic microbial mats in Lake Hoare, Antarctica	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We measured in situ photosynthesis of benthic microbial mats at various depths in Lake Hoare, a permanently ice-covered lake of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica, using oxygen (02) microelectrodes. We further investigated the vertical distribution and activity of pigments in the microbial mats using an imaging pulse-amplitude-modulated fluorometer. Microbial mats to at least 16.6-m water depth are net producers Of 02 during the summer period. Net 02 production ranges from 100-500 mu mol m(-2) h(-1) at incident downwelling irradiances of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) of 1.0-4.6 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1). Photosynthesis of mat-forming cyanobacteria and diatoms occurs at all lake depths at or close to maximum efficiency. We measured absorption by the pigment arrays at a single water depth and, by assuming that absorption is water-depth invariant, we estimated an area-specific maximum community quantum yield of 0.073 mol carbon per mol photons. A community compensation irradiance of 0.1 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1) was estimated, reflecting extreme shade acclimation. These results confirm estimates previously derived from laboratory gas-exchange measurements and imply that even minor changes in the intensity of the incident downwelling irradiance of PAR caused by, for example, changes in the transparency of the ice cover or the optical properties of the water column can significantly alter rates of benthic carbon fixation. In situ measurements were confined to mats with flat surfaces. Laboratory measurements at the surface of mats with pinnacled surfaces revealed a complex small-scale chemical structure at the mat-water interface.					; Vopel, Kay/AAZ-5474-2020	Hawes, Ian/0000-0003-2471-6903; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				JUL	2006	51	4					1801	1812		10.4319/lo.2006.51.4.1801	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2006.51.4.1801													WOS:000239262200023
J	HOLMAN, JA				HOLMAN, JA			LATE QUATERNARY HERPETOFAUNA OF THE CENTRAL GREAT-LAKES REGION, USA - ZOOGEOGRAPHICAL AND PALEOECOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Late Quaternary herpetological records from the Central Great Lakes States of Michigan, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio allow for reflections on reinvasion of herpetological species into previously uninhabitable areas, as well as some comments on paleoclimate. Advances of the Wisconsinan Laurentide ice sheet obliterated herpetological habitat in all of Michigan as well as much of Illinois, Indiana and Ohio; it also restricted herpetological habitat in the southern parts of the three latter states. By about 15-14 ka BP a rich herpetofauna, similar to the one that occurs in the area today, and suggesting a moderate climate, occurred in southwestern Indiana. Turtle faunas in central Indiana (13-12 ka BP) and west-central Ohio (11-10 ka BP) suggest that warm summer climates existed in those areas at the time. On the other hand authentic reptile records are unknown from the Pleistocene of Michigan, and considering the pollen record, that state probably had a much colder climate during postglacial Late Wisconsinan times. A well-developed turtle fauna associated with temperate deciduous forest occurred in southern Michigan about 6 ka BP, and a rich herpetofauna, similar to the one that occurs in the area today, occurred in southwestern Indiana about 4 ka BP. This evidence suggests the possibility that the herpetological reinvasion of the Central Great Lakes region might have been nearly complete by Mid-Holocene times.																			0277-3791						1992	11	3					345	351		10.1016/0277-3791(92)90005-S	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0277-3791(92)90005-S													WOS:A1992HP40000005
J	Yurk, BP; Hansen, EC; Hazle, D				Yurk, Brian P.; Hansen, Edward C.; Hazle, Dean			A deadtime model for the calibration of impact sensors with an application to a modified miniphone sensor	AEOLIAN RESEARCH												Due to deadtime effects, undercounting by aeolian impact sensors is present at all sediment flux levels. During a short time interval following an impact (the deadtime), an impact sensor is unable to detect new impacts. The degree of undercounting increases with increasing flux so that the sensor eventually becomes saturated. We develop an undercounting model for aeolian impact sensors that accounts for deadtime. This model was applied to field data obtained using a miniphone sensor modified from Ellis et al. (2009). The modified miniphone is inexpensive ($75.00 USD per pair, including datalogging) and easy to assemble. A protective layer of foil increases longevity at the probable expense of sensitivity. Modified Wilson and Cooke (MWAC) sand traps were paired with modified miniphones (MM) for intervals of up to 50 min during two winter storms along the coast of Lake Michigan. Sand from each MWAC was sieved, and the masses were fit to a continuous density function to estimate grain counts. MM deployed for cumulative periods of up to 200 showed no evidence of signal degradation. Fitting a deadtime model to the MM/MWAC data yielded a R-2 value of 0.9766. While short segments of the response curve can be approximated by a linear fit, linear models will fail if applied much beyond the experimental conditions at which they were calibrated. The deadtime curve is based on a more realistic model of how impact sensors work and should give a better approximation of aeolian sand flux over a broader range of impact rates.

J	Matyasovszky, I; Ljungqvist, FC				Matyasovszky, Istvan; Ljungqvist, Fredrik Charpentier			Abrupt temperature changes during the last 1,500 years	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												We investigate the occurrence of abrupt changes in a total of 35 different proxy records from the extra-tropical Northern Hemisphere for the last similar to 1,500 years. The proxy records include ice-core delta O-18, speleothem, tree ring width/density, marine sediment and lake sediment records with annual, sub-decadal or decadal resolutions. The aim is to explore the spatio-temporal distribution of abrupt climate changes using a kink point analysis technique. A clustering of warm kink points (the kink points with the highest temperatures) around AD 1000 appears corresponding to the Medieval Warm Period and indicates a geographically widespread temperature peak at that time. Kink points around AD 1000 are somewhat more numerous on higher latitudes than on lower latitudes. There are some tendencies for the coldest kink points (the kink points with the lowest temperatures) to be clustered in the ninetenth century, but they are generally more unevenly spaced in time than the warm peaks around AD 1000. The relative lack of kink points detected during the 1500 s-1700 s, likely the coldest part of the Little Ice Age, implies that this cold period was relatively stable and without abrupt events. A possible cluster of kink points on lower latitudes in the early ninth century is also found. No clear difference in the timing of kink points between the different proxy types can be observed.

Samples of black carp, grass carp and water in a pond were gathered in Spring 2021. Using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 high-throughput sequencing platform, the metagenomic mcrA gene sequences of black carp, grass carp and cultured water specimens were determined and analyzed. The outcomes indicate that the richness and diversity of methanogens in the intestinal tract of black and carp grass carp were highly correlated with the cultured water. Five bacterial genera were found in the three sets of samples, Methanosarcina, Methanocorpusculum, Methanospirillum, Methanobacterium and Methanofollis, in which Methanosarcina and Methanocorpusculum were the dominant genera. In addition, Methanosarcina had the greatest amount in grass carp and Methanocorpusculum had the greatest quantity in black carp. In conclusion, Methanosarcina and Methanocorpusculum were the main methanogens in the digestive tract of black and grass carp and culture water, and hydrolytic fermentative bacteria were its main metabolic substrate, hydrotrophic was its main metabolic pathway. The results will provide a reference for the relationship between intestinal methanogens and aquaculture and the greenhouse effect.

J	Smith, SM				Smith, Stephen M.			Chlorophyll fluorescence responses to additions of Pinus rigida L. pollen in freshwater kettle ponds of Cape Cod National Seashore (Massachusetts, USA)	LIMNOLOGICA												Terrestrial ecosystems contribute many different forms of organic matter to adjacent waterbodies. Carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in this material can significantly influence the planktonic communities of these systems, especially where there is a large proportion of contributing area relative to waterbody size and where nutrients are generally in short supply. Plant pollen, which upon degradation releases nutrients into the water column, is one such source of allochthonous material. In Cape Cod (Massachusetts, USA), large amounts of pollen from dense pitch pine (Pinus rigida L.) forest are deposited in late spring into small, freshwater lakes scattered across the landscape. This study examines in vivo chlorophyll fluorescence responses of surface-water samples collected from three such lakes within Cape Cod National Seashore (Wellfleet and Truro) to additions of P. rigida pollen in a laboratory setting. The results indicate that where influxes are high enough, pollen can have a stimulatory effect on phytoplankton communities and is a short-term nutrient subsidy in these systems at a time of year (May-June) when warming temperatures and faster growth rates elevate the demand for nutrients.																			0075-9511	1873-5851				JUL	2020	83								125781	10.1016/j.limno.2020.125781	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.limno.2020.125781													WOS:000555561200008

This study provides baseline information on the spatiotemporal water temperature distribution for examining the thermal environment for aquatic organisms in Lake Erhai. Temperature observation using temperature loggers was conducted from March to June 2009, covering the spawning period of most cyprinid fishes, the dominant taxonomic group of fish in the lake. During the daytime, the hourly average temperature was different between the surface and the bottom layer both in the littoral and pelagic zones; those differences disappeared during the nighttime, indicating nocturnal vertical water mixing. Daily average temperature, as well as intraday temperature variation, was negatively correlated with the site depth both in the surface and the bottom layers, suggesting that the littoral zone is warmer than the pelagic zone but less stable as a thermal habitat for aquatic species. Based on its geological location and depth, Lake Erhai could be classified as a polymictic lake, which tends to be well mixed; however, our study results indicate a high heterogeneity in water temperature. This specific thermal environment supports local fauna and flora and thus must be conserved to ensure their survival.

Microwave emission models have been used to simulate brightness temperatures (Tbs) for snowpack characteristics in terrestrial environments but cannot be applied to snow on lakes because of the differing subsurface emissivities and scattering matrices present in ice. This paper examines the performance of a modified version of the Helsinki University of Technology (HUT) snow emission model that incorporates microwave emission from lake ice and sub-ice water. Inputs to the HUT model include measurements collected over brackish and freshwater lakes north of Inuvik, Northwest Territories, Canada in April 2008, consisting of snowpack (depth, density, and snow water equivalent) and lake ice (thickness and ice type). Coincident airborne radiometer measurements at a resolution of 80 x 100 m were used as ground-truth to evaluate the simulations. The results indicate that subsurface media are simulated best when utilizing a modeled effective grain size and a 1 mm RMS surface roughness at the ice/water interface compared to using measured grain size and a flat Fresnel reflective surface as input. Simulations at 37 GHz (vertical polarization) produce the best results compared to airborne Tbs, with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 6.2 K and 7.9 K, as well as Mean Bias Errors (MBEs) of -8.4 K and -8.8 K for brackish and freshwater sites respectively. Freshwater simulations at 6.9 and 19 GHz H exhibited low RMSE (10.53 and 6.15 K respectively) and MBE (-5.37 and 8.36 K respectively) but did not accurately simulate Tb variability (R= -0.15 and 0.01 respectively). Over brackish water, 6.9 GHz simulations had poor agreement with airborne Tbs, while 19 GHz V exhibited a low RMSE (6.15 K), MBE (-4.52 K) and improved relative agreement to airborne measurements (R= 0.47). Salinity considerations reduced 6.9 GHz errors substantially, with a drop in RMSE from 51.48 K and 57.18 K for H and V polarizations respectively, to 26.2 K and 31.6 K, although Tb variability was not well simulated. With best results at 37 GHz, HUT simulations exhibit the potential to track Tb evolution, and therefore SWE through the winter season. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Karst research infrastructure is primarily used at the SLO KARST NFO (Near Fault Observatory) developing site. The area covers similar to 2600 km(2) and is one of the most seismically active areas in SW Slovenia. It consists mostly of karstified Mesozoic carbonate rocks and partly of non-karstified Eocene flysch. The landscape has numerous karst features including caves, poljes, dolines, uvalas, karst springs, ponors and periodic karst lakes, with typical karst underground water drainage. Site development commenced with the installation of seven temporary seismic stations in the area, along with other geoscience equipment (gravimeter, 3D laser terrestrial scanner, GNSS antenna, TM72 extensometers, spectrometer for methane and drone), deployed in 2020. With the new dense seismic network, locations and other seismic parameters are already determined more reliably than in the past, contributing to a better understanding of active tectonic deformations at the junction between the seismically active Friuli region (Italy) and the Zagreb-Petrinja area (Croatia). The new solid Earth Geoscience research infrastructure is already collecting a big amount of data following the FAIR principles (making data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) aiming to be included in the national and international research databases.

Design and deployment of a four-degrees-of-freedom hovering autonomous underwater vehicle for sub-ice exploration and mapping	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART M-JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING FOR THE MARITIME ENVIRONMENT												This paper describes the 2008 and 2009 Antarctic deployments of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ENDURANCE autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The goal of this project was to conduct three autonomous tasks beneath the ice cap 4m thick of West Lake Bonney: first, to measure the three-dimensional (3D) water chemistry of the lake at prespecified coordinates; second, to map the underwater face of the Taylor Glacier; third, to chart the bathymetry of the lake bottom. At the end of each mission the AUV had to locate and return through a hole in the ice slightly larger than the outer diameter of the vehicle. During two 10-week deployments to Antarctica, in the austral summers of 2008 and 2009, ENDURANCE logged 243 h of sub-ice operational time, conducted 275 aqueous chemistry sonde casts, completed a 3D bathymetry survey over an area of 1.06 km(2) at a resolution of 22 cm, and traversed 74 km beneath the ice cap of West Lake Bonney. Many of the characteristics and capabilities of ENDURANCE are similar to the behaviours that will be needed for sub-ice autonomous probes to Europa, Enceladus, and other outer-planet icy moons. These characteristics are also of great utility for terrestrial operations in which there is a need for an underwater vehicle to manoeuvre precisely to desired positions in 3D space or to manoeuvre and explore complicated 3D environments.

TREE-RING DATING OF OLD-GROWTH LONGLEAF PINE (PINUS PALUSTRIS MILL.) LOGS FROM AN EXPOSED TIMBER CRIB DAM, HOPE MILLS, NORTH CAROLINA, USA	TREE-RING RESEARCH												On 26 May 2003, intense rainfall from a series of thunderstorms in eastern North Carolina caused flooding that eventually destroyed the concrete dam in Hope Mills, draining Hope Mills Lake, and revealing a formerly submerged and buried structure that was identified as a timber crib dam. Inspection revealed these logs to be old-growth longleaf pines, which are now rare on the coastal plain landscape. Our primary objective was to develop a new multi-century longleaf pine tree-ring chronology by crossdating the tree rings from sections extracted from logs in the crib dam with an anchored tree-ring chronology created from nearby living longleaf pine trees. We also examined the climatic response in the longleaf pine trees to evaluate their potential for reconstructing climate. Using tree-ring measurements obtained from old-growth longleaf Pines found at it nearby church, we were able to date the rings on 21 series representing 14 logs from the crib dam, spanning the years 1597 to 1825. Distorted sapwood in many of the logs prevented LIS from finding absolute cutting dates and lessened the strength of correlation during the period of overlap between the church series and crib dam series. Human disturbances, specifically related to the naval stores industry, likely influenced the growth-ring patterns of the crib dam pine samples, as well. Correlation analyses between the longleaf pine chronology and temperature, precipitation, Palmer Drought Severity Indices, and North Atlantic Sea Surface temperatures showed a significant response to cool and wet spring months.

This review provides a summary of occurrence and compositions of FAAs in different water sources as well as their molar yields and contributions to N-DBPs formation. Moreover, the impacts of advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) on N-DBPs formation are also summarized. The average concentrations of FAAs in rivers, lakes, and reservoirs were 439, 402, and 370 nM (about 56.2, 51.5, and 47.4 mu g/L), in which cysteine, ornithine, alanine, glutamic acid, and serine were dominant among individual FAAs, with an average level of 25.6, 8.6, 6.2, 6.0, and 5.3 mu g/L, respectively. During the chlorination process, the molar yields of FAA for dichloroacetonitrile (DCAN), trichloroacetonitrile (TCAN), dichloroacetamide (DCAM), and trichloronitromethane (TCNM) were not detectable (ND)-7.1, ND-3.55, ND-0.93, and ND-1.99 mu mol/mmol, respectively, contributing 7.0%, 11.9%, 0.3%, and 10.3%, on average, to drinking water N-DBPs. During chloramination, the molar yields of FAA fall within ND-5.55, ND-3.55, 0.4-176, and ND-1.52 mu mol/mmol, constituting on average 5.3%, 18.4%, 0.8%, and 3.0% of DBPs' formation in drinking water. The information provided may help enrich the knowledge of FAAs and gain insights toward the importance of FAAs in forming N-DBPs.					; Li, Junling/AAI-5617-2020; Li, Yi ming/JWA-3152-2024	Du, Zhuorong/0009-0008-4231-8873; 														2690-0637				SEP 4	2024	4	9					3698	3712		10.1021/acsestwater.4c00572	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsestwater.4c00572		SEP 2024											WOS:001306515800001

Whether similar disturbances occur under field conditions remains to be confirmed. Lake Apopka, Florida, is contaminated with numerous chemicals, some of which possess endocrine-disrupting activity. Male mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) were collected monthly from December 2000 through May 2001 from Lake Apopka and two nearby reference lakes, Orange Lake and Lake Woodruff National Wildlife Refuge. Selected sexual characteristics were compared temporally and among lakes during the collection period. Male fish from Lake Apopka had slightly shorter gonopodia and on average 32 and 47% fewer sperm cells per milligram testis, when compared with the fish collected from Orange Lake and Lake Woodruff, respectively. The testes weights increased markedly during spring, with significantly smaller testes in fish from Lake Apopka than from Orange Lake, but surprisingly, the smallest testes occurred in males obtained from the Lake Woodruff population. The highest liver weights were found in the Lake Apopka population. Whole-body concentrations of testosterone and estradiol varied among months; the peak testosterone concentration occurred in January and was significantly lower in male fish from Lake Apopka compared with Orange Lake. The intensity of male courtship behavior was highly correlated to body testosterone concentration, but no statistically significant differences in sexual behavior among the lakes were found. We conclude that sexual characteristics of relevance to male reproductive capacity arc altered in the Lake Apopka mosquitofish population, and we discuss the presence of chemicals with antiandrogenic effects in Lake Apopka as a possible cause of the observed alterations.					; Baatrup, Erik/B-5371-2010	Toft, Gunnar/0000-0002-7542-6853; Edwards, Thea M./0000-0002-6176-2872													0091-6765	1552-9924				MAY	2003	111	5					695	701		10.1289/ehp.6022	http://dx.doi.org/10.1289/ehp.6022								12727596					WOS:000182788400025

Induced Polarization Images the Plumbing System of Hydrothermal Vents in an Intracontinental Rift, Lake Abhé, Republic of Djibouti	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Recent developments in induced polarization allow for the characterization of alteration halos within hydrothermal systems. We explore the possibility of using electrical conductivity and normalized chargeability tomograms in concert to image hydrothermal conduits thanks to their high cation exchange capacities associated with alteration. The hydrothermal plumbing system of the late-stage rift area of Lake Abhe (Republic of Djibouti) is used to test the ability of induced polarization to reveal such plumbing system associated with the prominent hydrothermal chimneys serving as vents for the hydrothermal fluids. We show that induced polarization can be used to provide an alteration tomogram, which highlights the flow path toward 2 chimneys in the top 70 m below the surface of the sediments at Lake Abhe. We are currently lacking tools to visualize the plumbing system of hydrothermal bodies. Because of its unique sensitivity to alteration, induced polarization represents a welcome and useful non-intrusive technique to image hydrothermal conduits including at large depths (kilometer scale). We develop a methodology to image the hydrothermal flow paths associated with the chimneys observed at Lake Abhe, Republic of Djibouti, located at the triple junction between the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, and main Ethiopian rift trends. These vents are associated with hydrothermal sublacustrine springs. The hydrothermal pathways are characterized by intense hydrothermal alteration.

These structures are characterized by strong top reflections of transparent internal character, and are 10-300 m wide and 0.5-20 m high. Consistent with previous work, they are interpreted as carbonate mounds formed by precipitation from CO2-rich groundwater discharge into the highly alkaline lake. Their age remains to be determined but their alignment along faults suggests tectonic control on their growth. Several sublacustrine channel networks were observed on the eastern shelf of the lake, which connects with onshore rivers. The channels are up to 500 m wide and 20 m deep, and plausibly were formed by fluvial processes during the major lake level drop reported to have occurred by 14 ka in earlier publications. Erosion is common on the channel walls flanked by levees. The channels are presently inactive or abandoned. At a water depth of 100 m, they all merge into a single larger channel; this channel has a sinuous course initially trending southwestward and then northwestward at a water depth of 130 m. Numerous closely spaced small channels (similar to 10-200 m wide, 1-10 m deep) are also seen on the eastern lacustrine shelf, interpreted as denditric and parallel channel systems formed during lake level fall terminating at similar to 14 ka. Bathymetric data provide evidence of numerous sublacustrine canyons on the western slope of the lake's northern basin, most likely remnants of relict rivers formed during this lowstand.					; Krastel, Sebastian/C-2001-2017; Gökdere, Aysegul/GWZ-7043-2022; Cagatay, M./S-6736-2016	Cukur, Deniz/0000-0003-2826-1897; Krastel, Sebastian/0000-0002-5899-9748; Gokdere, Aysegul Feray/0000-0002-3842-1711; 													0276-0460	1432-1157				OCT	2015	35	5					329	340		10.1007/s00367-015-0410-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00367-015-0410-x													WOS:000360846500001

Aeolian dust chemistry and bacterial communities in snow are unique to airshed locations across northern Utah, USA	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Wind-blown dust is an important source of trace metals, nutrients, and biological material to montane ecosystems. Mountain ranges in northern Utah are located downwind of multiple dust sources including the Great Basin Desert and the Wasatch Front urban area, providing an opportunity to investigate regional-scale differences in dust deposition chemistry and bacterial composition. We sampled discrete dust layers from snowpack across multiple locations in the Wasatch and Uinta Mountains (Utah) and the Snake Range (Nevada) during spring 2014 and 2015. Dust chemistry was unique in each airshed, suggesting that spatial variability and local sources were more important than temporal variability for the sampling period. The central Wasatch dust contained the highest concentrations of playa-associated elements (U, Mg, Li, Ca, Sr, As) and anthropogenic elements (Sb, Cu, Pb, Se) compared with lowest concentrations of these elements in the northern Wasatch, which is further from playa and anthropogenic sources. Sequential extractions indicate that the majority of Ca, Sr, and Cd is potentially available for transport during snowmelt while other elements are relatively immobile. Central Wasatch dust was more reactive to acetic acid than northern Wasatch dust for most elements, including REE + Y. Sr isotopes (Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios) were also unique to each sampling area, with the most radiogenic values in the central Wasatch. Similar to dust chemistry, bacterial communities in dusty snow reflected geographically localized dust events. In the central Wasatch, 69% of bacterial species were unique, suggesting that the airshed received the most diverse dust inputs from a combination of playa and anthropogenic sources. Gram-positive Actinobacteria and Firmicutes were common in snow but specific bacterial families distinguished airsheds (e.g., Bacillaceae, Geodermatophilaceae, Nakamurellaceae). Our results demonstrate that evaluating dust chemistry and bacteria in snow on a regional scale may more clearly link dust sources to the entrainment of pollutants and seeding of bacteria species to montane systems.

J	Chigbu, P				Chigbu, P			Population biology of longfin smelt and aspects of the ecology of other major planktivorous fishes in Lake Washington	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												I assessed the relationship between Cedar River flow (a major input to Lake Washington) during egg incubation and fly emergence period and longfin smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys) recruitment to Lake Washington. There was a significant inverse relationship between an index of abundance of odd-year class smelt and Cedar River mean flow during peak spawning period (February). There was no significant relationship between smelt abundance and peak flow during spawning period (March) of the even-year class smelt. Cedar River discharge greater than 28.33 m(3)/s occurred more frequently during odd years than even years. This, in addition to other factors, may be responsible for the relatively low recruitment of the odd-year spawning smelt and thus the population cycle observed in the Lake Washington smelt. The positive relationship between smelt recruitment and flow during spring, when smelt fly are migrating into the lake, supports other studies that suggest that an increase in turbidity at high flows reduces juvenile fish susceptibility to predation. There have been significant changes in the planktivorous fish assemblage in Lake Washington since the 1960s. Notably, longfin smelt, which was < 12% of the planktivorous fish abundance, now accounts for 58 to 84 % of the planktivore abundance. Recent increases in abundance of smelt may be related to reduced Cedar River mean flow that has enabled a larger proportion of spawned eggs to hatch and survive.																			0270-5060					DEC	2000	15	4					543	557		10.1080/02705060.2000.9663777	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2000.9663777													WOS:000165431900014

Investigation of tectonically affected groundwater systems through a multidisciplinary approach	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												This study uses a multidisciplinary approach to obtain a complete picture of the groundwater system of complex mountain aquifers. An Alpine region (the north-western area of Lake Como, Italy), characterized by two regional fault systems (The Breglia and Grona fault systems) containing different lithologies, was investigated using the multidisciplinary approach described here. The use of Principal Components Analysis (PCA), classical geochemical bivariate and trivariate diagrams of major and trace elements, and geostructural data, including remote sensing, permitted the identification of three principal groups of water. The first group, characterized by an enrichment of Ca2+ and HCO3-, flow in limestone. The second group is enriched in HCO3-, Ca2+ and Mg2+ and circulates through dolomite rocks. The third group, characterized by a decrease of Ca2+ and Mg2+, an increase of Na+ + K+ and a high Si/electrical conductivity (EC) ratio, flow in the basement rocks. Nevertheless, some peculiarities were evident. The matching of PCA, hydrochemical and geostructural information explains the role played by faults in water circulation. In particular, the Breglia fault permits the rise of deep water from crystalline basement and dolomite. Similarly, the Grona fault plays a role on drainage in proximity to the contact between the crystalline basement and the sedimentary cover. The springs located near the Grona fault rise into the crystalline basement but reflect a dolomite water chemistry. The multidisciplinary approach allowed understanding of the groundwater system and identification of fault systems not detectable with a geostructural survey. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Ice-out and freshet fluxes of CO2 and CH4 across the air-water interface of the channel network of a great Arctic delta, the Mackenzie	POLAR RESEARCH												Carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) were monitored at five sites spanning the upstream-downstream extent of the Mackenzie Delta channel network during May 2010, capturing the historically under-sampled ice-out period that includes the rising freshet, peak water levels and the early falling freshet (flood recession). Unexpectedly, partial pressures of CO2 in the Mackenzie River were undersaturated during the rising freshet before water levels peaked, indicating net CO2 invasion at instantaneous CO2 flux rates (F-CO2) ranging from -112 to -258 mg-C m(-2) d(-1). Net CO2 invasion was also observed around the time of peak water levels at sites in the middle and outer delta. Following peak water levels, the Mackenzie River switched to saturation and net CO2 evasion (F-CO2 from 74 to 177 mg-C m-2 d-1). Although the Peel River (which flows into the west side of the Mackenzie Delta) was a strong emitter of CO2 (F-CO2 from 373 to 871 mg-C m(-2) d(-1)), overall, the Mackenzie River and Delta were weak emitters of CO2 during the 2010 ice-out period. All sites were strong emitters of CH4 during ice-out, however, with the highest evasive fluxes observed in the outer delta when the extent of flooded delta landscape was greatest. Estimated aerial fluxes from Mackenzie Delta channel surfaces during May 2010 ranged from 2.1 to 4.8 Gg-C as CO2, and 186 to 433 Mg-C as CH4. These results provide critical information that can be used to refine gas flux estimates in high-latitude circumpolar river deltas during the relatively under-studied ice-out period.																			0800-0395	1751-8369				JUN 26	2020	39									10.33265/polar.v39.3528	http://dx.doi.org/10.33265/polar.v39.3528													WOS:000545892000001

In July and August 1990, elevated geosmin levels (10-48 ng/l) occurred in the East Branch of the aqueduct, which extends along the southern edge of the Mojave Desert. The geosmin episode was associated with attached algal growths on the sides of the aqueduct. A geosmin-producing cyanobacterium, possibly a Microcoleus sp., was isolated from both water and periphyton. In the summer of 1991, elevated levels of 2-methylisoborneol (MIB) occurred in the East Branch of the aqueduct (up to 78 ng/l), along with lower levels of geosmin. In July 1992, a recurrence of MIB production led to a severe off-flavor problem for a water agency that receives water directly from the aqueduct, resulting in numerous complaints from consumers. In both episodes, a Lyngbya sp. was isolated from periphyton and mud collected near the water's edge. These isolates were strong MIB producers in culture, yielding 240 and 260 mu g/l, respectively. Beginning in 1992, a second, relatively weak MIB producer, a Hyella sp., was isolated from membrane-filter plates inoculated with aqueduct water. These off-flavor episodes - associated with low flows during a drought period - showed that previously untainted water sources can be affected by these problems when conditions change.																			0273-1223						1995	31	11					41	48		10.1016/0273-1223(95)00454-U	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0273-1223(95)00454-U													WOS:A1995RW01400008

Associated planktonic Anabaena spp. blooms, dominated by Anabaena spiroides, fixed 29.5 Kg N/ha per yr. N fixation in both organisms was not obviously related to ambient dissolved inorganic N levels. By comparing 15N-N2 and acetylene reduction techniques, a ratio of 3 mol C2H2 reduced to 1 mol of N2 fixed was determined. Combining this with results from 1 diurnal investigation, it was estimated that 24% of the total daily fixation by Azolla occurred at night. Highest N fixation rates in Azolla occurred when plant density was lowest. N fixation by planktonic Anabaena spp. generally paralleled changes in biomass. Frond breakage due to wind caused a decrease in Azolla N fixation and growth which was followed by a bloom of planktonic Anabaena spp. A 2nd Anabaena spp. bloom was instrumental in the summer decline of Azolla. Maximum growth and N fixation of both organisms did not occur simultaneously. If physical disruption to the Azolla mat does not occur, it is likely that growth of the population would continued throughout the year.																			0029-8549	1432-1939					1979	43	3					269	281		10.1007/BF00344954	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00344954								28309884					WOS:A1979JA01100003

InSAR images from the different time intervals reveal that tbe10-km-wide caldera has been subsiding during the time of investigation. The pattern of subsidence does not following the pyroclastic flows from the last eruption of the caldera in 1931. The maximum subsidence is near the center of the caldera, with a rate of up to 13 mm/yr. Deformation outside the caldera is insignificant. Least squares inversion of the multi-temporal deformation maps indicates that the subsidence rate has been relatively constant. Field observations have identified numerous fumaroles inside the caldera. In 1973, temperatures of 80degreesC were measured at a depth of 15 cm in loose volcanic rubble adjacent to the small cinder cone (about 1.5 kin northeast of the vent of the 1931 eruption), whereas springs near a caldera lake had a temperature of 25degreesC in July 1993. Therefore, we suggest the observed subsidence at Aniakchak caldera is most likely caused by the reduction of pore fluid pressure of a hydrothermal system located a few kilometers beneath the caldera.					; Lu, Zhong/MZQ-2483-2025	Lu, Zhong/0000-0001-9181-1818; 													2153-6996		0-7803-8742-2				2004							637	640																WOS:000227006900167

Several types of sedimentary facies can be identified in this set of and red beds: mudstones of the plaza and intracontinental sebkha, aeolian sandstones, sandy conglomerates of the intermittent river, conglomerates of the pluvial fan, etc. These types of sedimentary facies constitute a typical desert system. Therefore, the Cretaceous strata in the Kuqa Basin provide a favorable condition for studies of sequence stratigraphic divisions of the desert system. With the rise and fall of the base level of the sedimentary basin, cyclicity is clearly revealed in stratigraphic records, which helps the identification of the third-order sequences. Based on the cyclicity in stratigraphic records, 5 third-order sequences can be found in the strata of the Early Cretaceous in the Kuqa Basin. These sequences comprise a second-order tectonic sequence. The primary feature of these third-order sequences is of an upward-fining sedimentary succession formed by a succession of "coarse sediments of the alluvial system-fine sediments of the lake system". The result of this study shows that aeolian sandstones are the best reservoirs of natural gas in the Cretaceous strata in the Kuqa Basin, and that the Kela-2 gas field is the first large gas field dominated by aeolian sandstone reservoirs in China.																			1000-9515	1755-6724					2004	78	3					744	755																WOS:000223386300019
J	Liutkus, CM; Ashley, GM				Liutkus, CM; Ashley, GM			Facies model of a semiarid freshwater wetland, Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania	JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH												The sedimentology and stratigraphy of a freshwater wetland in early Pleistocene (similar to 1.75 Ma) volcaniclastic deposits, Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, are characterized using texture, mineralogy, microfossils, and stratigraphic description to create a depositional facies model. The freshwater wetland was located on the margin of a semiarid, closed basin containing a playa lake. The lake-margin deposits are dominated by two distinct lithologies: waxy claystones and earthy sediments. Waxy sediments are olive green, dense claystones that contain authigenic minerals such as trona, and represent a fluctuating saline, alkaline lake (Hay 1976). Earthy sediments are beige, friable siltstones that contain siliceous microfossils, bone fragments, and minor pebbles; they represent the freshwater wetland. Microfossils from the earthy sediments and diatomites indicate freshwater marsh biota with some rare salt-tolerant species. Associated lithofacies are: diatomite, carbonate, and sandstone. Interpretation of vertical and lateral lithofacies variations in the 2 km(2) wetland, based on similar to 50 excavations, identified seven distinct sub-environments: spring deposits, perennial marsh, pool, ephemeral wetland, fringing wetland, wetland channel, and ephemeral stream. The stratigraphic sequence, estimated to represent an similar to 40-50 kyr long interval, indicates that persistent (similar to 10(3) yr) wet periods prevailed during the deposition of thick waxy clays when the lake expanded and flooded the wetlands, and equally long intervening dry periods caused the lake to contract, allowing the flourishing of wetlands and accretion of earthy sediment. The lithofacies associations in the Olduvai paleo-wetland provides an important first step in the development of a depositional environmental model for freshwater wetlands that can be tested elsewhere, particularly in and and semiarid settings.

J	Li, ZW; Gao, P				Li, Zhiwei; Gao, Peng			Channel adjustment after artificial neck cutoffs in a meandering river of the Zoige basin within the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China	CATENA												Neck cutoff is an essential process that significantly changes the morphodynamic characteristics of a meandering bend. In reality, however, observing natural processes of a neck cutoff is very difficult. In this study, we artificially triggered neck cutoffs by excavating a 0.4 m (width) x 0.5 m (depth) ditch to connect the beginning and ending of two highly convoluted bends along a meandering tributary of the upper Black River, a major tributary of the Upper Yellow River situated in the northeastern side of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China. Our morphologic and hydraulic measurements in summers of 2013, 2014, 2016, and 2017, the subsequent hydraulic geometry analysis, and three-dimensional simulation showed that both artificial ditches expanded fast to the size comparable to the former channel in a three-year period and the oxbow channel was disconnected from the former channel quickly, though sediment supply may be limited in this area. The morphological adjustment was featured by (1) distinct temporal trends of the development of the width/depth ratio between the two cutoff channels, (2) different diversion factors of the total discharge to the cutoff channel, and (3) diverse interaction patterns between cutoff and former channels. These discrepancies were supported by simulated different three-dimensional velocity distributions in the two cutoff channels, suggesting the importance of the clustered local velocities. Comparing these results with those reported in earlier studies showed that besides channel slope, unit stream power, and bank strength, the diversion angle between the cutoff and former channel played an important role in controlling channel adjustment. The discrepancy of the adjustment processes between the cutoff channel in this study and those in two previous ones revealed that channel adjustment after neck cutoff behaved differently under different physical settings and require more field-based studies.					; Li, Zhiwei/O-2351-2015	Gao, Peng/0000-0001-5323-9398; Li, Zhiwei/0000-0002-2870-7265													0341-8162	1872-6887				JAN	2019	172						255	265		10.1016/j.catena.2018.08.042	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2018.08.042													WOS:000449136800025

CRANBERRY INDUSTRY OF THE PACIFIC COAST	ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY												Although Massachusetts and New Jersey account for approx. 90% of the total cranberry acreage in the U. S., cranberry growing has steadily increased in Washington and Oregon. Environmental and economic requirements are rather exacting. Acid peat soil is required and peat bogs varying from 8 in. to 10 ft. in depth are used. Late spring frosts may occur, so protection against frost injury is provided by pruning the vines, using orchard heaters or wind machines, by resanding, or by flooding. An adequate supply of water and water drainage must be provided. Control of insects and weeds are important and aid in this has been given by the U. S. Dept. of Agric. and Washington State College Exp. Sta. The marsh begins producing at the end of 3 yrs. and comes into full bearing the 5th yr. Two vars. of berries, both developed in Massachusetts, are used McFarlin and Howe. The McFarlin must be hand picked, the Howe may be gathered by scooping, a cheaper way, but one involving greater loss of berries. Harvesting is done from Sept. 15 until Nov. 1 by migratory fruit pickers. The berries are sold through the Growers'' Marketing Association or independently, the latter usually to chain stores. The market for Washington and Oregon berries reaches as far east as Salt Lake City.																			0013-0095	1944-8287				APR	1941	17	2					180	186		10.2307/141146	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/141146													WOS:000203294700006

OCCURRENCE OF ORGANOHALOGENS IN PRISTINE EUROPEAN AND ANTARCTIC AQUATIC ENVIRONMENTS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												Pristine Alpine fresh water lakes with no run off were selected to monitor the atmospheric fall-out of C6-C12 organochlorine compounds. Off-shore marine areas were taken for monitoring the average marine pollution by these compounds. In both cases fish were used as bioextractors. The analytical work-up combines solvent-partition, liquid chromatography and glass capillary gas chromatography with the electron capture detector. The identification is done by matching high-resolution retention indices of unknowns with those of reference compounds. The following compounds could be identified in the spawn of Arctic chars (Salvelinus alpinus) caught in off-road Alpian lakes, in the liver of predatory Antarctic cod (Dissostichus eleginoides) caught near South Georgia and in Peru fish oil and crude sperm oil: hexachlorobenzene; .alpha.-, .beta.-, .gamma.-hexachlorocyclohexane; 4,4''-DDT; 4,4''-DDE; 4,4''-DDD; 2,4''-DDT; 2,4''-DDE; 2,4''-DDD; heptachloroepoxide; polychlorobiphenyls (PCB) and polychlorocamphenes (PCC).

From 12,000 to 10,500 cal yr BP a grass swamp existed until it was flooded by rising lake levels, indicated by the onset of marl deposition at the site. The onset of higher lake levels coincided with a transition from conifer-rich forest to mixed deciduous-evergreen forest, and a reduction in local biomass burning. Lake levels remained high until 6400 cal yr BP, thereafter fluctuating with possible dry phases at 4050, 2400 and 1100 cal yr BP. Increased burning is apparent from 2200 cal yr BP inferred to represent the onset of human forest clearance to its very reduced state today. The Inle Lake record compares with Holocene sequences in China, Thailand and India and marine cores south of Myanmar, which similarly show a regional pattern of drier conditions in the early Greenlandian stage, followed by maximum lake levels in the early Northgrippian stage. Fluctuating lake levels are evident in the later Northgrippian and Meghalayan stages after 6000 cal yr BP. This pattern coincides with precessional reduction in summer insolation in the region, which weakens the Asian Monsoon. The present-day bare catchments of Inle Lake probably mostly resulted from forest destruction over the last 2000 years although hints of human presence can be inferred throughout the older record.					; Hope, Geoffrey/O-2757-2019; van der Kaars, Sander/G-2268-2016	Hope, Geoffrey/0000-0001-8366-0677; van der Kaars, Sander/0000-0002-2511-0439													0031-0182	1872-616X				JUN 1	2019	523						18	29		10.1016/j.palaeo.2019.03.018	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2019.03.018													WOS:000466251800002
J	Figueira, B; Hayward, BW				Figueira, Brigida; Hayward, Bruce W.			Impact of reworked foraminifera from an eroding salt marsh on sea-level studies, New Zealand	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY AND GEOPHYSICS												Quantitative sea-level reconstructions using Holocene foraminifera are usually based on transfer function estimates of elevation derived from the tidal-elevation-related zonation of modern salt marsh foraminifera at the same site. Many New Zealand salt marshes are actively eroding as a result of recent sea-level rise exceeding sediment supply, making it difficult to find transects for modern analogue studies that are unaffected by erosion at their seaward ends. At Waikawa Harbour, South Island, New Zealand we show that reworked salt marsh foraminifera from the eroding bank have been mixed in significant quantities with in situ faunas: (1) in the sand flat seaward of the marsh; (2) in the spring tidal marsh on top of the 80-cm-high bank (together with mid tide foraminifera from the sand below the bank); and (3) transported laterally into a nearby non-eroding rush marsh at lower elevation. The fibrous organic-rich salt marsh mud of the bank has been undermined by erosion and large blocks have collapsed to a lower level on the sand flat where the in situ relict faunas are being mixed with newly colonised lower elevation salt marsh foraminifera. These studies show that eroding salt marshes may result in substantial reworking and mixing of foraminiferal tests into the modern faunas thereby compromising their use in sea-level reconstructions. This study prompted us to revisit part of a cored sequence at nearby Catlins Lake and reinterpret a previously inferred earthquake displacement (5-4.5 ka) to be the result of an eroding and collapsing salt marsh bank instead.

The 600 yr eruptive history of Villarrica Volcano (Chile) revealed by annually laminated lake sediments	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												Lake sediments contain valuable information about past volcanic and seismic events that have affected the lake catchment, and they provide unique records of the recurrence interval and magnitude of such events. This study uses a multilake and multiproxy analytical approach to obtain reliable and high-resolution records of past natural catastrophes from similar to 600-yr-old annually laminated (varved) lake sediment sequences extracted from two lakes, Villarrica and Calafquen, in the volcanically and seismically active Chilean Lake District. Using a combination of micro-X-ray fluorescence (mu XRF) scanning, microfacies analysis, grain-size analysis, color analysis, and magnetic-susceptibility measurements, we detect and characterize four different types of event deposits (lacustrine turbidites, tephra-fall layers, runoff cryptotephras, and lahar deposits) and produce a revised eruption record for Villarrica Volcano, which is unprecedented in its continuity and temporal resolution. Glass geochemistry and mineralogy also reveal deposits of eruptions from the more remote Carran-Los Venados volcanic complex, Quetrupillan Volcano, and the Huanquihue Group in the studied lake sediments. Time-series analysis shows 112 eruptions with a volcanic explosivity index (VEI) >= 2 from Villarrica Volcano in the last similar to 600 yr, of which at least 22 also produced lahars. This significantly expands our knowledge of the eruptive frequency of the volcano in this time window, compared to the previously known eruptive history from historical records. The last VEI >= 2 eruption of Villarrica Volcano occurred in 1991. Based on the last similar to 500 yr, for which we have a complete record from both lakes, we estimate the probability of the occurrence of future eruptions from Villarrica Volcano and statistically demonstrate that the probability of a 22 yr repose period (anno 2013) without VEI >= 2 eruptions is <= 1.7%. This new perspective on the recurrence interval of eruptions and historical lahar activity will help improve volcanic hazard assessments for this rapidly expanding tourist region, and it highlights how lake records can be used to significantly improve historical eruption records in areas that were previously uninhabited.

It is the result of research carried out from 1942-1979 in 23 hypogean cavities and from 1961-2000 in 25 lotic (52 sampling sites) and 17 lentic (24 sampling sites) biotopes. The lotic biotopes include hygropetric habitats, springs, streams, rivers and canals; the lentic biotopes include lakes of different origins and mountain pools. Ninety-one species and 7 subspecies from 18 families were collected. Forty-two species of different ecological categories are found only in lotic biotopes, 18 only in lentic biotopes and 7 species of Stenophylacinae only in hypogean cavities. The species belong to several chorological categories. Eighteen species and 7 subspecies are endemic to the Italian fauna. Six of these are limited to the regions of the Central Apennines, including Apatania volscorum Moretti, Cianficconi & Papagno exclusive to Lazio (Posta Fibreno Lake), Drusus aprutiensis Moretti endemic only to Lazio and Abruzzo, D. camerinus Moretti only to Lazio, Marche and Umbria, Glossosoma serravalle Malicky & Graf to Lazio (Velino River) and to Umbria and Marche (Nera River), Potamophylax cingulatus inermis Moretti & Cianficconi to Lazio, Abruzzo, Umbria and Marche, Allogamus antennatus ausoniae Moretti to Lazio, Abruzzo, Molise, Umbria and Marche.

LIFE HISTORY CHARACTERISTICS OF ALLIGATOR GAR (ATRACTOSTEUS SPATULA) IN THE UPPER RED RIVER (OKLAHOMA-TEXAS)	SOUTHWESTERN NATURALIST												Alligator gar (Atractosteus spatula) populations are declining in the southern United States and Mexico, prompting increasing efforts by state and federal agencies to manage populations. We sampled the alligator gar population in the Red River drainage of Oklahoma-Texas from March 2006 to April 2008 to evaluate population characteristics, identify efficient sampling techniques, and evaluate aging techniques. Catch rates for adult fish were highest using multifilament trammel nets (n = 80) during cold water periods (<12 degrees C) and for young-of-year fish using mini-fyke nets (n = 60) during warm water periods (>18 degrees C). Movements and home range were examined using ultrasonic telemetry. Home-range areas of six individuals were from 4.93 to 17.13 km(2) during a 4-9-month period. Spawning in Lake Texoma was documented in spring 2007. Sixty-four alligator gar were aged using double-blind methods of scale cross sections. A subsample of 14 individuals was also aged using whole otoliths to cross-reference scale ages. Age determinations ranged from 0 to 28 years at date of capture and suggest that the youngest gar were spawned in 2006 and 2007. Age determination of alligator gar using scale sections proved to be imprecise and biased toward overestimation of age in adults when compared with whole otolith ages. The alligator gar population in Lake Texoma and the Red River upstream of the reservoir appeared to be stable, represented by varied age and length classes, and is experiencing regular recruitment.																			0038-4909	1943-6262				JUN	2019	64	2					98	108		10.1894/0038-4909-64-2-98	http://dx.doi.org/10.1894/0038-4909-64-2-98													WOS:000537287900004

The rise and fall of Elaia were closely linked to the flourishing period of Pergamon, which ruled wide parts of today's western Turkey in Hellenistic times. In the framework of this research, the palynological analysis of a 9 m sediment core, Ela-70, retrieved from the enclosed harbour of the city, was carried out to reconstruct the vegetation and environmental history of the wider Gulf of Elaia region. An age-depth model, based on 11 calibrated radiocarbon ages, starting from 7.5 ka BP, provides the basis for the high resolution study of sediments from the Hellenistic period, as well as before and after. The lower part of the pollen diagram is characterised by high percentages of deciduous oaks and pines, suggesting the dominance of open forests close to the coring site. The change from oak forests to a cultural landscape, with olive, pistachio, walnut, and grape, started around 850 BC, reaching a maximum ca. 250 BC, and continuing to ca. AD 800. This period is characterised by increase of fire activity, soil erosion intensity, and pastoral farming. Such long-lasting intensive land use likely led to the climax ecosystem turnover from open deciduous oak forests to pine stands, while salt marshes developed around the coring site. The discovery of the dinoflagellate cysts of Peridinium ponticum, a Black Sea endemic species, in the harbour of Elaia evidences maritime trade between the Aegean Sea and the Black Sea; its first occurrence coincides with the time of the Mithridatic Wars (1st century BC). In conclusion, palynological data, in addition to historical and archaeological records, provide a deeper insight into human environmental interactions, as derived from the geoarchaeological archive of the harbour of Elaia.

Riverine transport of biogenic elements to the Baltic Sea - past and possible future perspectives	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												The paper reviews critical processes for the landsea fluxes of biogenic elements (C, N, P, Si) in the Baltic Sea catchment and discusses possible future scenarios as a consequence of improved sewage treatment, agricultural practices and increased hydropower demand (for N, P and Si) and of global warming, i.e., changes in hydrological patterns (for C). These most significant drivers will not only change the total amount of nutrient inputs and fluxes of organic and inorganic forms of carbon to the Baltic Sea, their ratio (C:N:P:Si) will alter as well with consequences for phytoplankton species composition in the Baltic Sea. In summary, we propose that N fluxes may increase due to higher livestock densities in those countries recently acceded to the EU, whereas P and Si fluxes may decrease due to an improved sewage treatment in these new EU member states and with further damming and still eutrophic states of many lakes in the entire Baltic Sea catchment. This might eventually decrease cyanobacteria blooms in the Baltic but increase the potential for other nuisance blooms. Dinoflagellates could eventually substitute diatoms that even today grow below their optimal growth conditions due to low Si concentrations in some regions of the Baltic Sea. C fluxes will probably increase from the boreal part of the Baltic Sea catchment due to the expected higher temperatures and heavier rainfall. However, it is not clear whether dissolved organic carbon and alkalinity, which have opposite feedbacks to global warming, will increase in similar amounts, because the spring flow peak will be smoothed out in time due to higher temperatures that cause less snow cover and deeper soil infiltration.

Reflecting climatological conditions, the cave ice undergoes repeated freeze-thaw cycles and regular yearly deposition of fresh ice. Three distinct ice block samples, collected from the frozen lake in May 2016, were analysed to obtain data on ice physicochemical properties and the composition of associated microbiota. Isotopic composition of the ice samples (O-18, H-2) and a local meteoric water line (LMWL) constructed for monthly precipitation at Postojna were used to estimate the isotopic composition of the water that formed the ice, which had high values of deuterium excess and low concentrations of chloride, sulphate and nitrate. The values of total organic carbon (1.93-3.95 mg/l) within the ice blocks fall within the range of those measured in karst streams. Total cell count in the ice was high and the proportion of cell viability increased along the depth gradient and ranged from 4.67x10(4) to 1.52x10(5) cells/ml and from 51.0 to 85.4%, respectively. Proteobacteria represented the core of the cave-ice microbiome (55.9-79.1%), and probably play an essential role in this ecosystem. Actinobacteria was the second most abundant phylum (12.0-31.4%), followed in abundance by Bacteroidetes (2.8-4.3%). Ice phylotypes recorded amounted to 442 genera, but only 43 genera had abundances greater than 0.5%. Most abundant were Pseudomonas, a well-known ice dweller, and Lysobacter, which previously was not reported in this context. Finally, two xanthophytes, Chloridella glacialis and Ellipsoidion perminimum, known from polar environments, were cultured from the ice. This indicates that the abundance and ecological role of phototrophs in such environments might be greater than previously deduced.					; Elersek, Tina/AAL-5672-2021; Holko, Ladislav/AAT-4452-2021; Pasic, Lejla/AAR-1224-2021	Kopitar, Andreja Natasa/0000-0002-2897-9017; Oarga Mulec, Andreea/0000-0002-0885-8429; Elersek, Tina/0000-0003-3296-3808; 													2045-2322					JAN 21	2021	11	1							1993	10.1038/s41598-021-81528-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-81528-6								33479448					WOS:000612982200136

Plio-Pleistocene synsedimentary fault compartments, foundation for the eastern Olduvai Basin paleoenvironmental mosaic, Tanzania	JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION												Normal faults displacing Upper Bed I and Lower Bed II strata of the Plio-Pleistocene Lake Olduvai were studied on the basis of facies and thickness changes as well as diversion of transport directions across them in order to establish criteria for their synsedimentary activity. Decompacted differential thicknesses across faults were then used to calculate average fault slip rates of 0.05-0.47 mm/yr for the Tuff IE/IF interval (Upper Bed I) and 0.01-0.13 mm/yr for the Tuff IF/IIA section (Lower Bed II). Considering fault recurrence intervals of similar to 1000 years, fault scarp heights potentially achieved average values of 0.05 -0.47 m and a maximum value of 5.4 m during Upper Bed I, which dropped to average values of 0.01 -0.13 m and a localized maximum of 0.72 m during Lower Bed II deposition. Synsedimentary faults were of importance to the form and paleoecology of landscapes utilized by early hominins, most traceably and provably Homo habilis as illustrated by the recurrent density and compositional pattern of Oldowan stone artifact assemblage variation across them. Two potential relationship factors are: (1) fault scarp topographies controlled sediment distribution, surface, and subsurface hydrology, and thus vegetation, so that a resulting mosaic of microenvironments and paleoecologies provided a variety of opportunities for omnivorous hominins; and (2) they ensured that the most voluminous and violent pyroclastic flows from the Mt. Olmoti volcano were dammed and conduited away from the Olduvai Basin depocenter, when otherwise a single or set of ignimbrite flows might have filled and devastated the topography that contained the central lake body. In addition, hydraulically active faults may have conduited groundwater, supporting freshwater springs and wetlands and favoring growth of trees. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ochsenreiter, T; Pfeifer, F; Schleper, C				Ochsenreiter, T; Pfeifer, F; Schleper, C			Diversity of Archaea in hypersaline environments characterized by molecular-phylogenetic and cultivation studies	EXTREMOPHILES												The diversity of Archaea from three different hypersaline environments was analyzed and compared by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based molecular phylogenetic techniques and cultivation approaches. The samples originated from a crystallization pond of a solar saltern in Spain (FC); an alkaline lake in Nevada, USA, (EMF); and a small pond from a slag heap of a potassium mine in Germany (DIE). Except for two 16S rDNA sequences that were related to crenarchaeota from soil and did not apparently belong to the indigenous halophilic community, all sequences recovered from environmental DNA or cultivated strains grouped within the Halobacteriaceae. Mostly 16S rDNA sequences related to the genera Halorubrum and Haloarcula were detected in sample FC, and organisms belonging to these genera were also recovered by cultivation. In contrast, sequences related to five different groups of halophilic archaea were amplified from sample DIE (including novel lineages with only uncultivated phylotypes), but the organisms that were cultivated from this sample fell into different groups (i.e., Natronococcus, Halorubrum, or unaffiliated) and did not overlap with those predicted using the culture-independent approach. With respect to the highly alkaline sample, EMF, four groups were predicted from the environmental 16S rDNA sequences, two of which (Natronomonas and Haloarcula) were also recovered through cultivation together with Natronococcus isolates. In summary, we found that halophilic archaea dominate the archaeal populations in these three hypersaline environments and show that culturability of the organisms predicted by molecular surveys might strongly depend on the habitat chosen. While a number of novel halophilic archaea have been isolated, we have not been able to cultivate representatives of the new lineages that were detected in this and several other environmental studies.					; Ochsenreiter, Torsten/E-6040-2010; Schleper, Christa/C-2567-2013	Ochsenreiter, Torsten/0000-0002-8846-8526; Schleper, Christa/0000-0002-1918-2735; Pfeifer, Felicitas/0000-0003-1631-1543; 													1431-0651	1433-4909				AUG	2002	6	4					267	274		10.1007/s00792-001-0253-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00792-001-0253-4								12215811					WOS:000177569300003

The source of the organic matter in the sediment was mainly from autochthonous phyto-plankton, therefore the significances of proxies can be interpreted as that high TOC, TOUTS, HI and delta C-13(org) values, low TC, TIC values corresponded to warm and wet climatic condition, and vice versa. The process of climatic development in the Zige Tangco region was hence recovered. During the early and Mid-Holocene, the climate was warm and wet and intensive cold events occurred during the periods of 8600 to 8400 cal a BP and 7400 to 7000 cal a BP. In the second half of Holocene, the climate became cold and dry gradually. The palaeoclimatic process during Holocene in Zige Tangco region matched well with that in Co Ngoin region which is ca 40 km to the south-east. Therefore this palaeoclimatic process represents the Holocene climatic feature in the Central Tibetan Plateau which has the same pattern in the Northern Tibetan Plateau, but the time and duration of some climatic events might be different. We can conclude that in Holocene solar insolation controlled the climatic pattern on the central Tibetan Plateau.

J	Todhunter, PE				Todhunter, P. E.			Hydrological basis of the Devils Lake, North Dakota (USA), terminal lake flood disaster	NATURAL HAZARDS												Devils Lake, a terminal lake in northeast North Dakota (USA), has experienced catastrophic flooding since 1993. From January 31, 1993, to December 31, 2014, lake level rose from 433.62 to 442.44 m, lake area expanded from 179.9 to 653.5 km(2), and lake volume increased from 0.70 to 3.80 km(3). More than $1 billion ($USD) has been spent in government payments to mitigate direct, primary, tangible flood damages. This paper provides a case study of the hydrological basis of the Devils Lake flood disaster. The unique geomorphic setting, paleoclimatic record, and hydroclimatic conditions of the region are summarized, and a wide range of hydroclimatic data is examined to provide a broad understanding of the physical basis of the flood disaster. The primary cause of the disaster was a transition to a sustained wetter climate that resulted in a dramatic response in basin hydrological variables in 1993. The transition from a long-term dry period to a long-term wet period caused the lake water budget to begin to change from an atmosphere-controlled water budget dominated by precipitation input to an amplifier lake water budget dominated by surface runoff input to the lake. Other important hydrological factors include a nonlinear precipitation-runoff relationship following the long-term drought, fill-spill and fill-merge hydrological behavior that is characteristic of wetland complexes, an increase in the lake area-to-basin area ratio, and the critical role of frozen soils in controlling infiltration and runoff production of spring snowmelt. Engineering works to manage lake volume through two outlets have reduced, but not entirely eliminated, future flood risk.					; Todhunter, Paul/AAJ-5134-2020	Todhunter, Paul/0000-0002-8506-9757; 													0921-030X	1573-0840				APR	2021	106	3					2797	2824		10.1007/s11069-021-04567-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11069-021-04567-2		FEB 2021											WOS:000616602200008

The influence of gas-particle partitioning and surface-atmosphere exchange on ammonia during BAQS-Met	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												The Border Air Quality and Meteorology study (BAQS-Met) was an intensive field campaign conducted in Southwestern Ontario during the summer of 2007. The focus of BAQS-Met was determining the causes of the formation of ozone and fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and of the regional significance of trans-boundary transport and lake breeze circulations on that formation. Fast (1 Hz) measurements of ammonia were acquired using a Quantum Cascade Laser Tunable Infrared Differential Absorption Spectrometer (QC-TILDAS) at the Harrow supersite. Measurements of PM2.5 ammonium, sulfate and nitrate were made using an Ambient Ion Monitor Ion Chromatograph (AIM-IC) with hourly time resolution. The median mixing ratio of ammonia was 2.5 ppb, with occasional high spikes at night resulting from local emissions. Measurements were used to assess major local emissions of NH3, diurnal profiles and gas-particle partitioning. The measurements were compared with results from A Unified Regional Air-quality Modelling System (AURAMS). While the fraction of total ammonia (NHx = NH3 + NH4+) observed in the gas phase peaks between 0.1 and 0.8, AURAMS tended to predict fractions of either less than 0.05 or greater than 0.8. The model frequently predicted acidic aerosol, in contrast with observations wherein NHx almost always exceeded the observed equivalents of sulfate. One explanation for our observations is that the net flux of ammonia from the land surface to the atmosphere increases when aerosol sulfate is present, effectively buffering the mixing ratio of gas phase ammonia, a process not included in the model. A simple representation of an offline bi-directional flux parameterization using the ISORROPIA thermodynamic model was successful at reducing the population of zero gas fraction points, but not the higher gas fraction points.					; VandenBoer, Trevor/F-1032-2011; Markovic, Milos/I-1612-2013; Murphy, Jennifer/C-2367-2011	VandenBoer, Trevor/0000-0001-8926-4237; 													1680-7316	1680-7324					2011	11	1					133	145		10.5194/acp-11-133-2011	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/acp-11-133-2011													WOS:000286180200010

However, the comprehensive evaluation of MPs and HMs is inadequate, failing to account for combined pollution characteristics. In this study, we applied the Multi-characteristics Potential Ecological Risk Index (MPERI), a novel index that integrated MPs characteristics to optimize a two-dimensional comprehensive index (TPI) for MPs-HMs combined pollution in sediments of Dongting Lake (DL). MPs and HMs were widely distributed in DL sediments, with contamination levels being notably higher in South Dongting Lake (SDL) and East Dongting Lake (EDL) compared to the lowest pollution intensity observed in West Dongting Lake (WDL). The predominant types of MPs in DL were small-sized MPs (50-100 mu m), fibers, and transparent/white MPs, with polypropylene (PP) being the primary polymer. MPERI results indicated that most sampling sites fell within high to dangerous categories. Small-sized MPs and highly toxic polymers such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC) presented a considerable threat to the ecological environment. Cd was the main metal causing potential ecological risks in DL. The TPI values (815.82 +/- 409.18) placed the lake's comprehensive risk level in the dangerous category. This study emphasizes the influence of MPs characteristics on the combined pollution of MPs-HMs in lake sediments and provides valuable insights for aquatic environmental management strategies.

CAUGHT FROM ZNINSKIE DUZE LAKE (POLAND)	JOURNAL OF ELEMENTOLOGY												The aim of this work was to compare the concentrations of Pb, Cd and Co in the meat, gills and liver of common bream (Abramis brama L.) caught from Zninskie Duze Lake. Analyses were carried out on 20 individual fish caught in autumn, in the natural environment. Measurements of the mass of the fish body (BW) and body length (Lc) were taken on the each specimen. Muscle samples were taken from the large side muscle of the fish body above the lateral line. Pb, Cd and Co concentrations were determined on an atomic absorption spectrometer Solaar 939 QZ. Significance of differences in the average content of metals was calculated by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Analyses of the variance indicated that the mean value of Pb was highest in gills (0.880 mg kg(-1) dry weight) and lowest in the liver (0.068 mg kg(-1) dry weight). The same results were observed for Co, and those values were 2.391 and 0.357 mg kg(-1) dry weight, respectively. The highest mean concentration of Cd was determined in the liver (0.143 mg kg(-1) dry weight). There were statistically significant differences in the content of all analyzed metals between the muscle, gills and liver (at p <= 0.05). Analyses indicated that the mean concentrations of Pb, Cd and Co were detected in the following order: Co > Pb > Cd (in the meat and gills) and Co > Cd > Pb (in the liver). Co and Pb accumulated in the large amounts in the gills (gills > meat > liver). Cd concentrations detected decreased in the following order: liver > meat > gills. Results of the principal component analysis (PCA) substantiated very good separation of the three analyzed tissues in respect of their metal content, which confirms the results obtained from the analysis of variance.																			1644-2296						2016	21	4					1141	1150		10.5601/jelem.2015.20.2.920	http://dx.doi.org/10.5601/jelem.2015.20.2.920													WOS:000390779100013

Effect of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus on Pacific herring in Prince William Sound, Alaska, from 1989 to 2005	DISEASES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS												We critically review the role of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) in the 1992-1993 collapse of the Prince William Sound (PWS) herring fishery. VHSV was detected in samples of moribund Pacific herring from PWS in spring 1993 when about 63 % of the expected fish failed to appear. A low prevalence and severity of VHSV were observed in adult pre-spawning PWS herring in most of the years from 1994 to 2002. The North American strain of VHSV became established about 500 yr ago in many northeast Pacific marine fish species, including herring. In Alaska, the typical annual prevalence of VHSV in pre-spawning herring ranges from 0 to 17 %. New threshold analysis of a 9 yr study indicates that only about half of the virus-infected adult fish in PWS were clinically affected; ulcers formerly attributed to VHS have been overestimated by a factor of about 3. We conclude that VHSV was not a primary causative factor in the PWS herring population collapse or in its failure to recover. Because older age classes of herring were not disproportionately missing in 1993, the protozoan Ichthyophonus hoferi was also not a likely cause of losses. The 'Exxon Valdez' oil spill occurred in PWS, Alaska, USA, in 1989. Evidence for interaction of oil and VHSV expression is also evaluated. A study exposing herring to varying concentrations of weathered crude oil showed increasing prevalences of VHSV correlated with oil concentration; however, repeated experiments with juvenile and adult fish failed to corroborate these results or link oil to VHSV infection in herring.

They are studied in relation to water loss prevention. In previous studies, evaporation suppressants have been effective in the laboratory and at small scales such as on swimming pools, ponds, and small lakes. Surfactants could be useful under drought conditions in arid areas of the world. Previous researchers conducted tests to estimate the spreading and coverage efficiencies of evaporation suppressants. Effectiveness of the suppressants in reducing evaporation is evaluated. Monolayers are one molecule thick films that form at a phase boundary such as the air-water interface. The optimal methods of spreading and reapplication of monolayers need to be determined. Hydrotopes are organic salt compounds and they improve the ability of water to dissolve other molecules. Hydrotropy is one of the solubility enhancement techniques which enhance solubility with use of hydrotropes. The purpose of the research is to measure the viscosity and natural evaporation of selected aqueous surfactant and hydrotope solutions. The viscosity of the aqueous-surfactant solutions at various concentrations are measured with falling ball viscometer. The surfactants are shown to increase viscosity when added to distilled water. Some surfactants and hyrotopes reduced natural convection water loss over five days showing an effect on evaporation rates.

Response of the interaction between groundwater and other components of the environment in Mexico	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY					33rd International Hydrogeologic Congress	2004	Zacatecas, MEXICO					This article reviews and discusses environmental aspects related to vertical upward and downward groundwater flow. Flow systems are an important tool to understand groundwater functioning as related to the environment, in terms of obtaining indicators of human impact and solving specific questions about a groundwater-environment system that has been influenced by anthropogenic means. This involves two broad processes. First, groundwater changes due to activities of man in the surrounding environment as a result of: (1) alteration of recharge by modification of native vegetation and original soil cover; (2) reduction of groundwater discharge to coastal areas and to inland water bodies producing desiccation of wetlands, lakes and springs; (3) groundwater contamination from sewage looses and uncontrolled waste disposal locations, and (4) up-welling of undesirable water quality induced by extraction. Second, environmental alterations due to changes in the groundwater regime produce: (1) increase in soil erosion through the disappearance of vegetation due to water-table decline, (2) water-table rise due to unplanned artificial recharge resulting from water imports to a catchment, (3) decline in water levels for improper extraction regime, (4) soil subsidence due to extraction mismanagement, and (5) disappearance of phreatofites caused by excessive extraction. Unless further understanding between groundwater and the other components of the environment is sought, the relationship between people and its environment will be subject to some of these effects, potentially endangering adequate human development and sustainable water management.					; Cardona Benavides, Antonio/C-8756-2018	Huizar Alvarez, Rafael/0000-0003-4037-3453; Cardona Benavides, Antonio/0000-0001-8121-4657													0943-0105					JUL	2008	55	2					303	319		10.1007/s00254-007-1005-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00254-007-1005-2													WOS:000257224100008
J	Mann, DH; Peteet, DM; Reanier, RE; Kunz, ML				Mann, DH; Peteet, DM; Reanier, RE; Kunz, ML			Responses of an arctic landscape to Lateglacial and early Holocene climatic changes: the importance of moisture	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Many of the physical and biological processes that characterize arctic ecosystems are unique to high latitudes, and their sensitivities to climate change are poorly understood. Stratigraphic records of land-surface processes and vegetation change in the Arctic Foothills of northern Alaska reveal how tundra landscapes responded to climatic changes between 13,000 and 8000 C-14 yr BP. Peat deposition began and shrub vegetation became widespread ca. 12,500 C-14 yr BP, probably in response to the advent of warmer and wetter climate. Increased slope erosion caused rapid alluviation in valleys, and Populus trees spread northward along braided floodplains before 11,000 C-14 yr BP. Lake levels fell and streams incised their floodplains during the Younger Dryas (YD) (11,000-10,000 C-14 yr BP). A hiatus in records of Populus suggest that its geographic range contracted, and pollen records of other species suggest a cooler and drier climate during this interval. Basal peats dating to the YD are rare, suggesting that rates of paludification slowed. Immediately after 10,000 C-14 yr BP, lake levels rose, streams aggraded rapidly again, intense solifluction occurred, and Populus re-invaded the area. Moist acidic tundra vegetation was widespread by 8500 C-14 yr BP along with wet, organic-rich soils. Most of these landscape-scale effects of climatic change involved changes in moisture. Although low temperature is the most conspicuous feature of arctic climate, shifts in effective moisture may be the proximate cause for many of the impacts that climate change has in arctic regions.

J	MUZIK, V				MUZIK, V			THE EFFECT OF SMALL HYDROELECTRIC POWER-PLANT ON ICHTHYOFAUNA OF THE LUBOCHNIANKA BROOK	ZIVOCISNA VYROBA												The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of operation of newly built small hydro-electric power plant (MVE) on ichthyofauna of the L'ubochnianka brook which flows from left side into the Vah river near the village L'ubochna below the city Ruzomberok. The stream is 24 km long, the locality studied was situated in its lower section where the L'ubochnianka brook creates a type of well-developed submontane brook. The bed of the brook passing through the village L'ubochna is regulated by the stream management, with rough boulder-strengthened bank, natural bottom and concrete sills 0.5 to 1.5 m high which considerably prevent counter-flow migration of salmonides. Fishery management of the brook is extensive, ichthyofauna is mostly maintained by autoreproduction. Angling pressure is not very strong. Research was conducted in two dates: April 19, 1993 - the state without influencing ichthyofauna; April 29, 1994 - after one year of operation of small hydro-electric power plant due to which flow capacity fell to 240 1/s, what is Q(364) daily minimum. In both dates the same segment of the brook, 170 m long and 6.2 m wide on an average, situated below the water discharge on the small hydro-electric power plant, was investigated. Ichthyofauna of the L'ubochnianka brook comprised three fish species: river trout (Salmo trutta m. fario), lake grayling (Thymallus thymallus) and bullhead (Cottus poecilopus) with dominant representation of the river trout (Tab. IV). Abundance and ichthyomass reduced from 1768 fish/hectare and 103 kg/ha in 1993 to 816 fish/ha and 46 kg/ha in 1994. The highest percentage was recorded in the river trout in which the values found in 1994 mean 37% abundance and 40% of biomass. The highest dominance according to the stocking rate had the second and third age groups of the trout, incongruency in both years of study; the greatest weight dominance was recorded in the third age group (Tab. III). In 1994 linear and weight increment of the river trout of the second, third and fourth age groups increased. The differences in linear growth were increasing with rising ages for the benefit of the population of 1994 (Tab. II). The date of annular ring creation was in the river trout identically specified in both dates at the end of April-beginning of May. In 1994 the total production dropped by 67% and available production by 51% (Tab. V). The marked reduction in population density and the river trout production can be explained by lower broken relief of the brook due to long-lasting minimum discharges. The height of level fell on average by 15 to 20 cm, and bank gullies, providing hiding places, were uncovered, due to it the part of population, mostly greater trouts, had to leave the observed section.																			0044-4847						1995	40	5					221	226																WOS:A1995QZ69800007

Deglaciation and postglacial environmental changes in the Teton Mountain Range recorded at Jenny Lake, Grand Teton National Park, WY	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Sediments contained in lake basins positioned along the eastern front of the Teton Mountain Range preserve a continuous and datable record of deglaciation and postglacial environmental conditions. Here, we develop a multiproxy glacier and paleoenvironmental record using a combination of seismic reflection data and multiple sediment cores recovered from Jenny Lake and other nearby lakes. Age control of Teton lake sediments is established primarily through radiocarbon dating and supported by the presence of two prominent rhyolitic tephra deposits that are geochemically correlated to the widespread Mazama (similar to 7.6 ka) and Glacier Peak (similar to 13.6 ka) tephra layers. Multiple glacier and climate indicators, including sediment accumulation rate, bulk density, clastic sediment concentration and flux, organic matter (concentration, flux, delta C-13, delta N-15, and C/N ratios), and biogenic silica, track changes in environmental conditions and landscape development. Sediment accumulation at Jenny Lake began centuries prior to 13.8 ka and cores from three lakes demonstrate that Teton glacier extents were greatly reduced by this time. Persistent ice retreat in Cascade Canyon was slowed by an interval of small glacier activity between similar to 13.5 and 11.5 ka, prior to the end of glacial lacustrine sedimentation similar to 1.15 ka. The transition to non-glacial sediments marks the onset of Holocene conditions at Jenny Lake and reflects a shift toward warmer summers, increased vegetation cover, and landscape stability in the Tetons. We discuss the Teton lake sediment records within the context of other regional studies in an effort to construct a comprehensive overview of deglaciation and postglacial environmental conditions at Grand Teton National Park.

Effects of Stocking Rate, Stocking Size, and Angler Catch Inequality on Exploitation of Stocked Channel Catfish in Small Missouri Impoundments	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Put-grow-take fisheries for channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus provide popular sport fisheries in many small impoundments and lakes throughout the United States. These fisheries are costly to maintain because the fish that are stocked are usually large fingerlings (> 175 mm total length). Given the substantial fiscal and human resources required, it is important that these stockings contribute to the fishery. We estimated the exploitation of stocked channel catfish by tagging fish in 14 small impoundments to determine their use. Secondly, we determined whether the stocking rate, stocking size, and angler catch inequality (proportion of tags returned) affected exploitation. Annual exploitation varied more than 10-fold among the impoundments, ranging from 0 to 0.65 for the year after the fall stockings and usually declining thereafter. Cumulative exploitation in the 3 years after stocking ranged from 0 to 0.69, indicating that there is wide variation in the use of the stocked fish. Exploitation was unrelated to the stocking rate but was affected by stocking size, larger fish being more vulnerable than smaller fish to catch and harvest. In several impoundments, one to three anglers accounted for one-third or more of all returned tags, showing that just a few anglers can markedly affect exploitation. These results suggest that exploitation can be dynamic. changing with stocking size and angling clientele. Despite this inherent variability, we found substantial differences in exploitation among lakes. Managers should focus on impoundments where channel catfish are heavily exploited. possibly by stocking more fish or implementing protective harvest restrictions. For lightly exploited lakes. reducing stockings may be necessary to improve the growth and size structure of channel catfish.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				OCT	2008	28	5					1486	1497		10.1577/M08-003.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M08-003.1													WOS:000261796900011

River ice break-up, in particular, poses high socioeconomic and ecological expenses, including morphological changes and damage to riverine structures. This study aims to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of river ice in the River Tornionjoki, including the timing of ice break-up at different latitudes. We utilized observation data and remote sensing techniques to track changes in ice patterns overtime on the River Tornionjoki. The study indicates that the ice break-up in the River Tornionjoki basin typically occurs during Apr-Jun based on the reach location in different latitudes; therefore, different stations behave according to their latitudinal location. We observed significant spatial variations in ice break-up timing across the basin, with an earlier break-up in the lower latitudes compared to the upper latitudes. The average ice break-up day in lower latitude stations ranges between 200-205, while in higher latitude stations the average ice break-up day ranges between 215-228.

Predation by native sunfishes (Centrarchidae) on the invasive crayfish Orconectes rusticus in four northern Wisconsin lakes	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Introduced rusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus) often establish abundant populations in lakes where they negatively impact native food webs. However, rusty crayfish do not become abundant in all lakes. Fish predation has been posed as one potential mechanism limiting rusty crayfish density, but there is limited empirical evidence to support this hypothesis. Using a case study approach, we quantified the extent and timing of predation on nonnative rusty crayfish by three native centrarchids in four northern Wisconsin lakes with contrasting crayfish densities. We estimated population-level predation effects on rusty crayfish using bioenergetics models in combination with fish and crayfish abundance estimates. Bluegill (Lepomis machrochirus) and pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus) consumed young-of-year crayfish exclusively whereas rock bass (Ambloplites ruspestris) consumed a wide size range of crayfish. Rusty crayfish were found in Lepomis diets primarily in late June and early July while rock bass consumed crayfish throughout the summer. Per individual, rock bass consumed more crayfish biomass than Lepomis, but at the population-level, higher Lepomis densities resulted in greater numbers of crayfish and more crayfish biomass consumed by Lepomis than rock bass. Lepomis populations consumed 8 x , 14 x , 22 x and 120 x more individual crayfish than rock bass populations in the four study lakes. Bioenergetics simulations revealed that dense populations of Lepomis were capable of consuming a large percentage of the juvenile crayfish population in two of our study lakes. In systems with high Lepomis densities, Lepomis consumption of juvenile rusty crayfish may play a significant role in the invasion and establishment dynamics of rusty crayfish.

J	Caplanne, S; Laurion, I				Caplanne, Sophie; Laurion, Isabelle			Effect of chromophoric dissolved organic matter on epilimnetic stratification in lakes	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Empirical studies on lake thermal regimes have shown that stratification is correlated with the concentration of dissolved organic matter (DOM). Thermal stratification has implications for photosynthesis, photoinhibition, photobleaching and carbon cycling. The objectives of this study were to quantify the role of chromophoric DOM (CDOM) on epilimnetic thermal structure and to estimate the contribution of ultraviolet (UV), visible and infrared radiation (IR) to the near-surface warming of lakes as a function of their DOM content. A simplified thermal model was applied, assuming all energy absorbed by the system is converted to heat and excluding mixing and heat losses. For the upper 0.5 m of the water column, the model generated a temperature increase of 1.5 degrees C after one hour of noon irradiance in a strongly humic lake, as compared to 1 degrees C in pure water. UV, visible light and IR contributed 6, 32 and 62% of warming in the humic lake, compared to 0, 5 and 95% in pure water. As CDOM absorption coefficient increases, UVA and especially visible light play an increasing role in stratification. Field data also support the significant role of CDOM absorption on near-surface thermocline occurrence. Near-surface stratification was a common feature during summer in a lake with a moderate DOC content (4.8 mg L-1) and color (a(320) = 16.4 m(-1) ). Based on a temperature-stability criterion of 0.2 degrees C m(-1) , this lake had a stable epilimnion 64% of the time, compared to 53% for a lake that had much lower DOC concentration (1.8 mg L-1) and color (3 m(-1)).

J	Cui, LL; Zhong, LH; Meng, JC; An, JC; Zhang, C; Li, Y				Cui, Lilu; Zhong, Linhao; Meng, Jiacheng; An, Jiachun; Zhang, Cheng; Li, Yu			Spatiotemporal Evolution Features of the 2022 Compound Hot and Drought Event over the Yangtze River Basin	REMOTE SENSING												A rare compound hot and drought (CHD) event occurred in the Yangtze River Basin (YRB) in the summer of 2022, which brought serious social crisis and ecological disaster. The analysis of the causes, spatiotemporal characteristics and impacts of this event is of great significance and value for future drought warning and mitigation. We used the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE)/GRACE Follow-On (GRACE-FO) data, meteorological data, hydrological data and satellite remote sensing data to discuss the spatiotemporal evolution, formation mechanism and the influence of the CHD event. The results show that the drought severity caused by the CHD event was the most severe during 2003 and 2022. The CHD event lasted a total of five months (from July to November), and there were variations in the damage in different sub-basins. The Wu River Basin (WRB) is the region where the CHD event lasted the longest, at six months (from July to December), while it also lasted four or five months in all the other basins. Among them, the WRB, Dongting Lake Rivers Basin (DLRB) and Mainstream of the YRB (MSY) are the three most affected basins, whose hot and drought severity values are 7.750 and -8.520 (WRB), 7.105 and -9.915 (DLRB) and 6.232 and -9.143 (MSY), respectively. High temperature and low precipitation are the direct causes of the CHD event, and the underlying causes behind this event are the triple La Ni & ntilde;a and negative Indian Ocean Dipole event. The two extreme climate events made the Western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH) unusually strong, and then the WPSH covered a more northerly and westerly region than in previous years and remained entrenched for a long period of time over the YRB and its adjacent regions. Moreover, this CHD event had a devastating impact on local agricultural production and seriously disrupted daily life and production. Our results have implications for the study of extreme disaster events.					cui, lilu/IXL-0105-2023; Zhong, Linhao/ABZ-2769-2022; An, Jiachun/ABG-4275-2020	cui, lilu/0000-0002-7694-2972; An, Jiachun/0000-0002-3106-0714														2072-4292				APR	2024	16	8							1367	10.3390/rs16081367	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs16081367													WOS:001210369300001
J	Turner, AM; Ruhl, N				Turner, Andrew M.; Ruhl, Nathan			Phosphorus loadings associated with a park tourist attraction: Limnological consequences of feeding the fish	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The Linesville spillway of Pymatuning State Park is one of the most visited tourist attractions in Pennsylvania, USA, averaging more than 450,000 visitors center dot year(-1). Carp (Cyprinus carpio Linnaeus) and waterfowl congregate at the spillway where they are fed bread and other foods by park visitors. We hypothesized that the "breadthrowers" constitute a significant nutrient vector to the upper portion of Pymatuning Reservoir. In the summer of 2002, we estimated phosphorus loadings attributable to breadthrowers, and compared these values to background loadings from Linesville Creek, a major tributary to the upper reservoir. Items fed to fish included bread, donuts, bagels, canned corn, popcorn, corn chips, hot dogs, birthday cakes, and dog food. Phosphorus loading associated with park visitors feeding fish was estimated to be 3233 g day(-1), and estimated P export from the Linesville Creek watershed was 2235 g center dot day(-1). P loading attributable to breadthrowers exceeded that of the entire Linesville Creek watershed on 33 of the 35 days of study, with only a heavy rainfall event triggering watershed exports that exceeded spillway contributions. Averaged across 5 weeks, breadthrowers contributed 1.45-fold more P to Pymatuning Reservoir than the Linesville Creek watershed. If Linesville Creek P exports are extrapolated to the entire Sanctuary Lake watershed, spillway contributions of P added 48% to the non-point source watershed P entering the lake. Park visitors feeding fish at the Linesville Spillway are a significant source of nutrients entering Sanctuary Lake.					; Ruhl, Nathan/AAE-5137-2020	Ruhl, Nathan/0000-0002-2684-4573; 													0364-152X	1432-1009				APR	2007	39	4					526	533		10.1007/s00267-005-0155-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-005-0155-9								17265114					WOS:000245078700008

Field observations on the structural and stratigraphic characteristics of snow and ice from four lake sites are used in support of the interpretation of changes in synthetic aperture radar backscatter intensity as a function of time and incidence angle (20-49degrees). Results show that bubble inclusions, most of which are tubular and oriented in the direction of growth, strongly influence backscatter intensity from floating ice in RADARSAT Standard beam mode imagery. It is shown that radar return can vary considerably as a function of incidence angle. Differences of as much as 6.5 dB were observed for the same ice cover when observed at steeper (20-35degrees) compared with shallower (35-49degrees) incidence angles. During the early stages of ice growth and/or when the ice volume contains a small amount of tubular bubbles, backscatter intensity from the floating ice measured at shallower incidence angles (35-49degrees) is similar to that observed from the grounded ice at any incidence angle (-17 to -11 dB). A strong decrease in backscatter was observed at all sites during spring thaw and was explained by the microwave signal being absorbed by the wet snow cover and by specular reflection from the standing water (ponds) on the lake ice surface. With its multiple beam mode configurations, RADARSAT offers an improved temporal coverage over ERS-1/2, thus making it possible to determine more precisely freeze-up and break-up dates, and timing of bottom freezing from shallow Arctic and sub-Arctic lakes.

Contact Zone of European (Meles meles Linnaeus, 1758) and Asian (M. leucurus Hodgson, 1847) Badgers (Mustelidae, Mammalia) in the Right- and Left-Bank Districts of the Saratov Region	BIOLOGY BULLETIN												The DNA studies of badgers (Meles sp.) from the right-bank and left-bank areas of the Volga River in the Saratov region are described. Asian badgers (Meles leucurus Hodgson, 1847) inhabit the Left Bank of the Volga river in the Saratov region, while European badgers (M. meles Linnaeus, 1758) inhabit the Volga Right-Bank districts of the region; however, Asian badgers have been found in Khvalynsky district of the Saratov region in addition to the European badger. Despite the sufficient number of publications devoted to the Asiatic badger distribution in the Vyatka-Kama region and the Volga region and the studies devoted to the development of systematics of the genus Meles in Russia, the question of the boundaries of the ranges of European and Asiatic badgers and the zones of their sympatry (parapatry) in the Volga-Kama region has not been fully investigated to date. Our work is devoted to the study of this question. The analysis of biological material that we have collected has shown that all five of the studied badger individuals from the Saratov Volga region phenotypically look like Asian badgers; however, DNA analysis showed that only two of them were M. leucurus and other three were heterozygous individuals carrying genes from both species and were identified as hybrids. The remaining 29 individuals were captured in the right-bank areas of the region. Samples were taken from badger individuals from the northern to southern borders of the region in the areas located along the Volga River on the Volga Upland and in the Oka-Don Plain. Among them, one individual from Khvalynsky district turned out to be an Asian badger, one individual from Krasnoarmeysky district was a hybrid of these two species, and three individuals, one from Tatishchevsky, the second from Volsky and the third from Khvalynsky districts showed introgression of Asian badger genes into the genotype of European badger. Thus, we have managed to find out that, at this stage of the development of the climatic cycle phase in the Lower Volga Region characterized by warming winters, the Volga River, with its two reservoirs within the Saratov region, is not an absolute zoogeographical boundary and badgers whose species are characterized by winter sleep can under certain conditions overcome, most likely on ice, both the river itself and the lake parts of the Volgograd and Saratov reservoirs. According to the revealed introgression in some individuals from different areas on the Volga Upland of the right bank of the Saratov region, it can be assumed that such traveling across the Volga River took place earlier, possibly before its flow was regulated by dams.

J	McGowan, HA; Sturman, AP				McGowan, HA; Sturman, AP			A hydrometeorological approach to the forecasting of inflows to alpine lakes	PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												Short- to medium-term trends in air temperature, precipitation, and atmospheric circulation patterns are investigated with respect to the variability of natural inflows into two remote alpine hydroelectric-storage lakes situated in the central Southern Alps, New Zealand. Standard meteorological observations of air temperature and precipitation are used in conjunction with a synoptic circulation index to develop linear regression inflow models that explain a high degree of variability in natural inflows on a monthly basis. However, when a one-month lag period is introduced into the analysis procedure, only 33% to 53% of the variance in the following month's mean inflows is explained using the same input variables. Both ambient air temperature and precipitation are shown to be principal determinants in the generation of natural inflows, including those from the long-term melt of perennial snow, icefields, and glaciers. A water-balance study for both catchments identified that runoff from these sources contributes 30% to 60% of recorded mean monthly inflows throughout summer. As a result, changes to the general circulation pattern of the southwestern Pacific that result in colder ambient air temperatures or more frequent cloud cover, as observed during El Nino episodes, may significantly reduce inflows into alpine lakes. This is of immense practical importance to the managers of such resources.					; McGowan, Hamish/AAD-9607-2021	Sturman, Andrew/0000-0002-2103-3616; 													0272-3646					NOV-DEC	1996	17	6					513	533		10.1080/02723646.1996.10642599	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02723646.1996.10642599													WOS:A1996XH39500002

The long and intertwined record of humans and the Campi Flegrei volcano (Italy)	BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY												The Campi Flegrei volcano (or Phlegraean Fields), Campania, Italy, generated the largest eruption in Europe in at least 200 ka. Here we summarise the volcanic and human history of Campi Flegrei and discuss the interactions between humans and the environment within the "burning fields" from around 10,000 years until the 1538 CE Monte Nuovo eruption and more recent times. The region's incredibly rich written history documents how the landscape changed both naturally and anthropogenically, with the volcanic system fuelling these considerable natural changes. Humans have exploited the beautiful landscape, accessible resources (e.g. volcanic ash for pulvis puteolana mortar) and natural thermal springs associated with the volcano for millennia, but they have also endured the downsides of living in a volcanically active region-earthquakes, significant ground deformation and landscape altering eruptions. The pre-historic record is detailed, and various archaeological sites indicate that the region was certainly occupied in the last 10,000 years. This history has been reconstructed by identifying archaeological finds in sequences that often contain ash (tephra) layers from some of the numerous volcanic eruptions from Campi Flegrei and the other volcanoes in the region that were active at the time (Vesuvius and Ischia). These tephra layers provide both a relative and absolute chronology and allow the archaeology to be placed on a relatively precise timescale. The records testify that people have inhabited the area even when Campi Flegrei was particularly active. The archaeological sequences and outcrops of pyroclastic material preserve details about the eruption dynamics, buildings from Roman times, impressive craters that now host volcanic lakes and nature reserves, all of which make this region particularly mystic and fascinating, especially when we observe how society continues to live within the active caldera system. The volcanic activity and long record of occupation and use of volcanic resources in the region make it unique and here we outline key aspects of its geoheritage.

Climatic analysis to determine where to collect and release Puccinia jaceae var. solstitialis for biological control of yellow starthistle	BIOCONTROL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Puccinia jaceae var. solstitialis is an autoecious rust fungus that is native to areas of Afro-Eurasia with a Mediterranean climate. An isolate collected near Sivas, Turkey was released for classical biological control of yellow starthistle (YST), which is an invasive alien weed in California, USA. The fungus has been released throughout California, but long-term establishment rates are generally low, apparently because this ecotype is not well adapted to the climate where the weed is most invasive. Using a site with excellent establishment as a target, the Match Climates function in CLIMEX climate modeling software identified similar sites in and around the San Francisco Bay Area, east to the Central Valley and Sierra foothills, and along the coast of Southern California. Similar sites in other states include Walla Walla, Washington, Pendelton, Oregon and Salt Lake City, Utah. A Compare Locations model based primarily on experimentally measured temperature and humidity requirements of the rust produced similar results. Using Sacramento, California, which is in the center of YST distribution, as a target, the Match Climates function predicted that the best locations to search for rust accessions to use in California are near Tunis, Tunisia, Foggia, Italy, Khalkis, Greece, Kayseri, Turkey, and possibly Constantine, Algeria. This generally agrees with the prediction of a Compare Locations model based on the geographic distribution of YST in California. Climatic factors that limit the long-term establishment of the fungus are likely to be summer heat and/or dry stress and short dew periods.																			0958-3157	1360-0478					2011	21	3					333	351		10.1080/09583157.2010.546522	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09583157.2010.546522													WOS:000287590800007

Relative abundance [catch/hour of electrofishing (CPUE)] was significantly lower in post-regulation years (1993-1995, 243/hour) than in pre-regulation years (1990-1992, 520/hour). However, this decline was likely more attributed to recruitment patterns than to regulation effects. There was no significant difference (P = 0.18) between pre- and post-regulation bluegill size distribution. The only significant change in pre- and post-regulation mean length-at-age was for age-1 bluegill (134 rum vs. 123 mm, P = 0.04). However, this difference is suspect due to low sample sizes and the effect of extended spawning period on the "actual" age of bluegill captured in the fall. Mean bluegill angler total effort, and catch, release, and harvest rates declined significantly (P < 0.05) from pre- to post-regulation. Mean weight of bluegill harvested increased significantly (88 to 152 g, P = 0.02) but total yield declined (633 kg to 72 kg, P = 0.03) after the regulation was implemented. We were unable to detect any benefits to,the bluegill population or to anglers. Thus, we recommend removal of the regulation.																									2001							334	345																WOS:000184053000031

Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Virus among Wild Birds in Mongolia	PLOS ONE												Mongolia combines a near absence of domestic poultry, with an abundance of migratory waterbirds, to create an ideal location to study the epidemiology of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) in a purely wild bird system. Here we present the findings of active and passive surveillance for HPAIV subtype H5N1 in Mongolia from 2005-2011, together with the results of five outbreak investigations. In total eight HPAIV outbreaks were confirmed in Mongolia during this period. Of these, one was detected during active surveillance employed by this project, three by active surveillance performed by Mongolian government agencies, and four through passive surveillance. A further three outbreaks were recorded in the neighbouring Tyva Republic of Russia on a lake that bisects the international border. No HPAIV was isolated (cultured) from 7,855 environmental fecal samples (primarily from ducks), or from 2,765 live, clinically healthy birds captured during active surveillance (primarily shelducks, geese and swans), while four HPAIVs were isolated from 141 clinically ill or dead birds located through active surveillance. Two low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIV) were cultured from ill or dead birds during active surveillance, while environmental feces and live healthy birds yielded 56 and 1 LPAIV respectively. All Mongolian outbreaks occurred in 2005 and 2006 (clade 2.2), or 2009 and 2010 (clade 2.3.2.1); all years in which spring HPAIV outbreaks were reported in Tibet and/or Qinghai provinces in China. The occurrence of outbreaks in areas deficient in domestic poultry is strong evidence that wild birds can carry HPAIV over at least moderate distances. However, failure to detect further outbreaks of clade 2.2 after June 2006, and clade 2.3.2.1 after June 2010 suggests that wild birds migrating to and from Mongolia may not be competent as indefinite reservoirs of HPAIV, or that HPAIV did not reach susceptible populations during our study.

J	Epstein, DM; Wurtsbaugh, WA; Baker, MA				Epstein, David M.; Wurtsbaugh, Wayne A.; Baker, Michelle A.			Nitrogen partitioning and transport through a subalpine lake measured with an isotope tracer	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We used a stable isotope tracer to measure nitrogen (N) assimilation and transfer through Bull Trout Lake, a 0.3-km(2) mountain lake in Idaho, specifically to explore the relative importance of pelagic and benthic producers. (NO3-)-N-15 was added into the inflow stream above the lake during spring runoff and the resulting mass of tracer was measured within the various ecosystem compartments, including the outflow stream. Although a portion of the (NO3-)-N-15 moved through the lake quickly due to a low hydraulic residence time during the addition, the tracer was also assimilated rapidly by seston in the water column and at a slower rate by benthic primary producers. By the end of the 10-d injection, 10% of the tracer had left via outflow, 21% was within seston, and 17% was in epiphytes and macrophytes. However, 70 d after the termination of the injection, only similar to 1% of the tracer remained within seston, whereas 10% was within the benthic primary production compartment as N was recycled within the benthic zone. Quantitative transfer of N-15 to invertebrate and fish consumers was low, but turnover in these compartments was slow. A conservative water mass tracer (bromide) indicated that the turnover rate for lake water was 1.8% d(-1), whereas N-15 turnover for the whole lake was only 0.7% d(-1), demonstrating how lakes exert drag on nutrients as they move through the watershed. Due to uptake and storage of nutrients, Bull Trout Lake strongly influenced the timing and magnitude of nutrient export from its watershed.					; Wurtsbaugh, Wayne/G-6856-2011; Baker, Michelle/F-3434-2010	Baker, Michelle/0000-0002-7188-8639; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				SEP	2012	57	5					1503	1516		10.4319/lo.2012.57.5.1503	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2012.57.5.1503													WOS:000308640600020

These impacts can influence the levels of the Great Lakes and the volumes of channel flow among them, thus affecting their value for interests such as riparians, shippers, recreational boaters, and natural ecosystems. On one hand, a hydrological modeling suite using input data from the CGCM1 predicts large drops in lake levels, up to a maximum of 1.38 m on Lakes Michigan and Huron by 2090. This is due to a combination of a decrease in precipitation and an increase in air temperature that leads to an increase in evaporation. On the other hand, using input from HadCM2, rises in lake levels are predicted, up to a maximum of 0.35 m on Lakes Michigan and Huron by 2090, due to increased precipitation and a reduced increase in air temperature. An interest satisfaction model shows sharp decreases in the satisfaction of the interests of commercial navigation, recreational boating, riparians, and hydropower due to lake level decreases. Most interest satisfaction scores are also reduced by lake level increases. Drastic reductions in ice cover also result from the temperature increases such that under the CGCM1 predictions, most of Lake Erie has 96% of its winters ice-free by 2090. Assessment is also made of impacts on the groundwater-dependent region of Lansing, Michigan.

Fe3O4@MIPs not only possessed excellent dispersibility and enough magnetic properties in aqueous solutions, but also displayed good selectivity towards six amphetamines, with an imprinting factor ranging from 1.8 to 2.6. The adsorption kinetics closely aligned with the pseudo-second-order model, and the adsorption efficiency exceeds 80 % for each amphetamine at equilibrium. Fe3O4@MIPs were then employed as the efficient adsorbents for the extraction of amphetamine drugs. Extraction parameters, including sample pH, the mass of adsorbent, and the type and volume of eluting solvent, were carefully optimized. In combination with the high performance liquid chromatography tandem triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS), a selective magnetic solid-phase extraction (MISPE) method utilizing Fe3O4@MIPs was developed for the detection of six amphetamines in water samples. The limits of detection and limits of quantitation were determined to be 5.2 similar to 23 ng L-1 and 17 similar to 77 ng L-1, respectively. Recoveries for the six target drugs from lake water and sewage samples fell within the range of 87.2 similar to 110 %. Additionally, the MISPE-HPLC-MS/MS method exhibited excellent repeatability, with a precision below 8.5 % at two spiking levels. The prepared Fe3O4@MIPs possessed the advantages of high selectivity, straightforward preparation, facile separation and good reusability, and was highly suitable for the efficient extraction of amphetamine-type substances in complex environmental water.

In comparison with their mesophilic analogues, halophilic metabolites are stable under extreme conditions typically encountered in the industrial processes. In this study, the biotechnological potential of twenty strains of halophilic bacteria isolated from the Provadia salt deposit, Bulgaria was investigated for the first time. The strains were identified based on the sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and were assigned to 13 different species falling in the Bacillota and Pseudomonadota phyla. The majority (90%) of them showed single or combined hydrolytic enzyme activity. Half of the strains (55%) were able to produce between three and eight extracellular hydrolytic enzymes-arabinase, cellulase, gelatinase, glucanase, L-glutaminase, pectinase, and xylanase. Ten strains were able to synthesise exopolysaccharides (EPS) in concentration between 32 and 227 mu g/ml. The optimal EPS production kinetics (1.6 +/- 0.15 g/l) by Virgibacillus halodenitrificans PSZ-34 was systematically investigated for the first time. Three strains also exhibited antimicrobial activity. The present study involved culture-dependant isolation of halophilic bacteria from the Provadia salt deposit and shed more light on their capability to synthesise hydrolytic enzymes and EPS with potential industrial exploitation.

J	Hill, CA; Eberz, N; Buecher, RH				Hill, C. A.; Eberz, N.; Buecher, R. H.			A Karst Connection model for Grand Canyon, Arizona, USA	GEOMORPHOLOGY												A new model for the connection of the eastern and western Grand Canyon is proposed that involves westward flow of Redwall karst aquifer water under the Kaibab arch along the steepest hydraulic gradient to discharge at a structural low in a headward-eroding protowestern Grand Canyon. A karst-aquifer hydrological connection was first established between the eastern and western Grand Canyon, then collapse, incision, and headward erosion of the canyon followed this subterranean route. This proposed model is based on what is happening today on the northern Marble Platform where the Redwall-Muav aquifer is still intact. The three sinkhole/caves Ah Hol Sah, Indian Pit, and Black Abyss provide vertical flow routes down to the Redwall karst aquifer, joining water discharging from the Kaiparowits hydrologic basin to the Colorado River along the Fence Springs system. Projecting this process back in time and spatially southward, we propose that at around 6 Ma a sinkhole or sinkholes existed at the confluence of the Colorado River with the Little Colorado River. Little Colorado River water, then flowing northward to an interior lake basin ("Glen Lake') in southern Utah, became pirated down this sinkhole(s), thus causing a reversal of drainage (barbed tributaries) in Marble Canyon. Headward erosion then proceeded up Marble and Little Colorado Canyons from the collapsing sinkhole, with Marble Canyon incision breaching Glen Lake at around 5.5 Ma. This effected the "final connection" and total integration of the Colorado River from Colorado to the Gulf of California. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

J	Nicholson, SE				Nicholson, SE			Historical and modern fluctuations of Lakes Tanganyika and Rukwa and their relationship to rainfall variability	CLIMATIC CHANGE												This paper describes the fluctuations of Lakes Tanganyika and Rukwa over the last two centuries. Lake chronologies extending back to the late eighteenth century are derived from reports of European visitors, settlers and explorers and from oral accounts of the local peoples. The historical fluctuations are meshed with the modern record to provide a picture of the lakes' fluctuations until the late twentieth century. The historical fluctuations of the lakes are quire similar. The most important of these are low levels during the first half of the nineteenth century, very high stands in the last decades of the nineteenth century, and, around the turn of the century, a rapid fall to twentieth century levels. This pattern is ubiquitous throughout eastern Africa and is apparent in numerous other lakes, including Victoria, Naivasha, Stefanie, Turkana, Malawi and Chilwa. Driest periods were in the 1920s or earlier and in the 1950s. Lake Tanganyika returned to extremely high stands in the 1960s and has continued to maintain relatively high stands since that time. Lake Rukwa rose to high stands during the 1980s and maintained them for several years. An analysis of rainfall variability shows that these trends are generally explained by variations in catchment rainfall. However, the lakes' responses to rainfall variability are sometimes dissimilar because Lake Rukwa is a closed basin. Our results demonstrate the complexity of the rainfall/lake-level relationships and the need to use water balance relationships in order to interpret the lakes' historical or paleo-fluctuations in terms of rainfall.																			0165-0009					JAN	1999	41	1					53	71		10.1023/A:1005424619718	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1005424619718													WOS:000078751600004

Extent of alteration, paleomagnetic history, and infrared spectral properties of the Tarda ungrouped carbonaceous chondrite	METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE												Tarda is an ungrouped, hydrated carbonaceous chondrite (C2-ung) that was seen to fall in Morocco in 2020. Early studies showed that Tarda chemically resembles another ungrouped chondrite, Tagish Lake (C2-ung), which has previously been linked to the dark D-type asteroids. Samples of D-type asteroids provide an important opportunity to investigate primitive conditions in the outer solar system. We show that Tarda contains few intact chondrules and refractory inclusions and that its composition is dominated by secondary Mg-rich phyllosilicates (>70 vol%), carbonates, oxides, and Fe-sulfides that formed during extensive water-rock reactions. Quantitative assessment of first-order reversal curve (FORC) diagrams shows that Tarda's magnetic mineralogy (i.e., framboidal magnetite) is comparable to that of the CI chondrites and differs notably from that of most CM chondrites. These traits support a common formation process for magnetite in Tarda and the CI chondrites. Furthermore, Tarda's pre-terrestrial paleomagnetic remanence is similar to that of Tagish Lake and samples returned from asteroid Ryugu, with a very weak paleointensity (<0.6 mu T) suggesting that Tarda's parent body accreted more distally than that of the CM chondrites, possibly at a distance of >5.4-8.3 AU. An origin in the cold, outer regions of the solar system is further supported by the presence of distinct, porous clasts enriched in aliphatic-rich organics that potentially retain a pristine interstellar composition. Together, our observations support a genetic relationship between Tarda and Tagish Lake.

J	Zhang, CJ; Mischke, S				Zhang, Chengjun; Mischke, Steffen			A Lateglacial and Holocene lake record from the Nianbaoyeze Mountains and inferences of lake, glacier and climate evolution on the eastern Tibetan Plateau	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Our 12.81 m long record from Lake Ximencuo provides insight into the Lateglacial and Holocene evolution of the lake and the Nianbaoyeze glacier in its catchment, and the regional climate history since similar to 19 kyr. Lake Ximencuo was a permanent deep lake throughout its history. In contrast to numerous lakes on the Tibetan Plateau which experienced shallow lake levels or even desiccation during the Lateglacial, Lake Ximencuo was fed by large quantities of meltwater in the Lateglacial. The existence of glaciated upper catchment areas is apparently a prerequisite for lakes on the Tibetan Plateau which maintained relatively high water levels during the generally cold and dry periods following the global LGM (similar to 21 kyr). A minor re-advance of the Nianbaoyeze glacier was recorded coeval with the Greenland Stadial 2a (similar to 16.4 and 14.5 kyr), followed by rapid warming apparently synchronous with the Greenland Interstadial 1. Warmest conditions were recorded at Lake Ximencuo during the early Holocene which was punctured by a remarkable pulse of climate deterioration around 8.3 kyr. This spell represents probably the 8.2 kyr event of the North Atlantic region, suggesting that it had a significant impact on the Tibetan Plateau. Colder conditions of longer duration occurred from 4.7 to 3.7 kyr, apparently in phase with numerous records signalling colder and drier conditions on the Tibetan Plateau. Two minor spells of colder conditions and probably catchment erosion were recorded in the late Holocene between 2.0 and 1.4 kyr and between 0.5 and 0.1 kyr with the latter representing the Little Ice Age. It is unclear, whether human activities may have accelerated or even solely triggered the late Holocene erosion events. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Accumulation of salt-rich dust from Owens Lake playa in nearby alluvial soils	AEOLIAN RESEARCH					Meeting of the American Geophysical Union on Aeolian Dust - Transport Processes, Anthropogenic Forces and Biogeochemical Cycling	DEC 14, 2009	San Francisco, CA					Over the last 100 years, Owens Lake playa in eastern California has been one of the largest point sources of PM-10 dust in the United States. Here we evaluate the spatial impact cif the salt-rich playa dust on the alluvial piedmont soils of Owens Valley with the expectation that those nearest the playa will have the highest concentrations of playa-derived salts. We sampled soils of similar age on alluvial fans derived from Sierra Nevada granites along the valley axis to determine soluble salt and specific ion concentrations. Salt concentrations are indeed highest in those soils most proximate to the playa, with higher levels of sodium and elevated pH. However, one site directly north of the playa has significantly higher salt concentrations as measured by electrical conductivity (EC) compared to all other soils sampled, an average pH of about 10 and a sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) greater than 15, suggesting a strong impact of local dust as a result of local topography and wind patterns. Although EC, pH, and SAR of other sampled soils fall into normal ranges for sandy granitic soils in a semi-arid climate, the soils closer to the playa show greater salt and sodium impact than those further away. The strong local impact of playa salts and the patterns of salt contribution away from the playa suggest a spatial effect of dust on the alluvial soils that will grow both in intensity of impact and in distance from the playa if dust fluxes remain at recent levels.

Four to nine different MAAs (predominantly porphyra-334 and shinorine) were found in the copepods Boeckella gibbosa, B. gracilipes, B. meteoris and Parabroteas sarsi, and in the ciliate Stentor amethystinus, while MAAs were undetectable in the cladoceran Daphnia middendorffiana. Among the different copepods, maximum MAA concentrations accounted for 0.25-1.31% of the dry weight, and contents were generally about three to seven times (up to 43 times) higher in the animals living in the clearest lakes compared to those occurring in low-UV systems. This variability in the content of MAAs was related to the lake altitude (r(2) = 0.71), and the fraction of the water column to which 1% of the surface UV radiation at 320 nm penetrated (r(2) = 0.57). Our data therefore underscore the role of MAAs as sunscreens to decrease the potential negative effects of solar radiation, but they also indicate that other environmental factors besides UV transparency play a role in determining MAA concentrations. One lake was selected to obtain additional information on the qualitative composition of MAAs in seston of <100 mum between two sampling sites and over a 2 month study period (austral summer). Six different MAAs were detected in the samples, with porphyra-334 and palythine being predominant. In the copepods collected simultaneously, there was low variation in MAA concentrations between the two sites and over time. Thus, our results suggest that under similar UV exposure conditions MAA contents of planktonic organisms show low temporal variation.					; Temporetti, Pedro/IUO-8407-2023	Baffico, Gustavo D./0000-0002-6178-3542; Tartarotti, Barbara/0000-0002-7171-0216; Zagarese, Horacio/0000-0001-6588-5960													0142-7873	1464-3774				JUL	2004	26	7					753	762		10.1093/plankt/fbh073	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbh073								21258622					WOS:000222270800005

Synchronizing the Western Gotland Basin (Baltic Sea) and Lake Kalksjon (central Sweden) sediment records using common cosmogenic radionuclide production variations	HOLOCENE												Multi-archive studies of climate events and archive-specific response times require synchronous time scales. Aligning common variations in the cosmogenic radionuclide production rate via curve fitting methods provides a tool for the continuous synchronization of natural environmental archives down to decadal precision. Based on this approach, we synchronize Be-10 records from Western Gotland Basin (WGB, Baltic Sea) and Lake Kalksjon (KKJ, central Sweden) sediments to the C-14 production time series from the IntCal20 calibration curve during the Mid-Holocene period similar to 6400 to 5200 a BP. Before the synchronization, we assess and reduce non-production variability in the Be-10 records by using Be-10/Be-9 ratios and removing common variability with the TOC record from KKJ sediments based on regression analysis. The synchronizations to the IntCal20 C-14 production time scale suggest decadal to multi-decadal refinements of the WGB and KKJ chronologies. These refinements reduce the previously centennial chronological uncertainties of both archives to about +/- 20 (WGB) and +/- 40 (KKJ) years. Combining proxy time series from the synchronized archives enables us to interpret a period of ventilation in the deep central Baltic Sea basins from similar to 6250 to 6000 a BP as possibly caused by inter-annual cooling reducing vertical water temperature gradients allowing deep water formation during exceptionally cold winters.

Input reduction of both nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are commonly recognized as basic ways of controlling blooms, but little is known about the roles of nutrients and their using strategy among cyanobacteria in triggering the succession of diazotrophic to non-diazotrophic cyanobacteria. In this study, we investigated in situ responses of cyanobactria to ambient P status during the transition from Dolichospermum flos-aquae to Microcystis spp. in Lake Taihu and Lake Chaohu. While dominant in phytoplankton community, D. fibsaquae experienced P deficiency as evidenced by qualitative detection of extracellular phosphatase via enzyme labeled fluorescence (ELF). The percentage of ELF-labelled D. fios-aquae cells was 33% when it dominated the phytoplankton community, and was 78% when it co-dominated with Microcystis spp., indicating an increase in P deficiency. Meanwhile, no ELF-labelled Microcystis cells were observed while polyphosphate body (PPB) were present, suggesting that Microcystis spp. were not P deficient. Additionally, the percentages of Microcystis cells containing PPB showed an inverted "U-shaped" relationship with concentrations on soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP). To validate the field observation, a laboratory study of the monocultures of the dominant cyanobacteria was conducted. Extracellular alkaline phosphatase activity (APA) and PPB accumulation were regulated by P availability in monocultures of D. flos-aquae. Interestingly, no cell bound extracellular phosphatase was found on Microcystis aeruginasa even in the culture without P supply. Consistently, the expressions of phosphatase encoding gene phoX showed no differences among the treatments. The way in which PPB accumulation occurred in Microcystis spp. in response to P availability in the cultures was similar to that observed in the field, demonstrating a strategy of energy conservation over P accumulation. The competitive advantage of Microcystis spp. was displayed at low P concentrations: where it could rapidly uptake and store inorganic P, which also increased the P deficiency of the coexisting phytoplankton species. Responses of P-transport gene pstS confirmed this hypothesis. The physiological and molecular mechanisms mentioned above enable Microcystis to survive and proliferate in environment with low available P supply more efficiently. In conclusion, different cyanobacterial species have distinct ways of responding to P availability, suggesting that the control of cyanobacterial blooms by targeted nutrient reduction is largely dependent upon the dominant species. P reduction is more effective in controlling diazotrophic cyanobacteria than non-diazotrophic cyanobacteria.

J	Armenteros, I; Edwards, N				Armenteros, Ildefonso; Edwards, Nicholas			Palaeogeographic, palaeoclimatic, palaeohydrological and chemical/biochemical controls on accumulation of late Eocene coastal lacustrine-palustrine limestones, Southern England	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												The shallow-lacustrine to palustrine Hatherwood Limestone Member of the late Eocene Headon Hill Formation, Southern England, is in a succession of fluvio-estuarine and laguno-lacustrine siliciclastic sediments. It is up to 8.0 m thick and is subdivided by metric-scale palaeotopographic erosion surfaces, one of which underlies lenticular humic siliciclastic mudstones. The limestone lithologies are (1) biocalcilutites/biocalcisiltites, (2) biocalcarenites, (3) calcirudites, and (4) laterally-discontinuous laminar and fenestral crusts. Lithology (1) accumulated in a low-energy shallow-lacustrine depositional environment, indicated by the predominance of pulmonate pond-snails in the mollusc assemblage. In contrast, lithologies (2) and (3) are the coarse-grained fills of shallow palaeotopographic lows, and also form basal lags and palaeokarst-fills. Lithology (3) comprises remnant autochthonous lags that resulted from selective erosion during lacustrine transgressions. Brecciation and proto-intraclast to nodular differentiation in lithology (2) suggests derivation of the intraclasts from subaerially- and pedogenically-modified shallow-lacustrine muds. Laminar crusts (4), 0.5-6.0 cm in thickness, display irregularly undulose and anastamosing laminations 150-400 mu m thick, that display differential staining by iron oxide. The abundance of rootlet traces and calcitised parenchymatic root tissues in the fenestral crusts suggests a palustrine depositional environment for these lithologies. The siliciclastic mudstone lithologies are (1) black humic muds and (2) blue-green silty muds and marls. The high C/N molar ratio of the black muds suggests derivation of the humic content mainly from vascular plants in local wetlands. The mollusc assemblage of the blue-green siliciclastic muds resembles floodplain lake assemblages from the regional Palaeogene succession. Mean stable isotopic values for limestone samples, of 4.75 1.53 for delta C-13 and 2.77 +/- 1.47 for delta O-18, indicate a relatively heavy tendency within published spectra for Tertiary lacustrine carbonates. The delta O-18 isotope results agree with published subtropical surface-water palaeotemperatures for this succession. The total characteristics of the Member therefore suggest a shallow-lacustrine to palustrine depositional environment. Pedogenic overprinting and mechanical reworking displayed by the limestones are attributable to seasonal fluctuations of water level during lake highstands, but in this marine-influenced setting, major long-term lake lowstands, resulting in deep erosion and palaeokarsting of the limestones, may be attributable to falls in relative sea-level.

NEW DATA ABOUT ZOO-BENTHAL POPULATIONS OF ROMANIAN LITTORAL LAKES	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY												On the basis of 58 bottom samples collected in the summer of 2000 the authors present the quantitative state of benthic associations in the takes belonging to the Romanian littoral (from the south part-Neptun-to the north part: Siutghiol, Tasaul, Nuntasi and Babadag), In the all investigated lakes, the diversity of bottom fauna is relatively low - about 32 taxa, 17 species and 15 supra-specific taxa were identified (in all lakes 6 taxa and 5 supra-specific taxa are commune). Among the benthic invertebrates, the crustacean and insect-larvae populations are the most important, by their numerical density; they are followed by Nematoda and Oligochaeta from worm group and mollusca populations. Generally, the largest part of the bottom fauna occurs on all type of substratum in the all lakes, being eurytop species (nematod and oligochata worms, same species of ostracoda and copepoda crustacean). Some species are peculiar only for certain type of substratum, being less numerous (turbellarian and hirudinea species worms, some species of mysidaceam crustacean: Paramysis baerii bispinosa on the sandy bottoms, Pterocuma pectinata - cumaceam crustacean and Gammaridae amphipoda on the submerged vegetation). Between benthic populations from all lakes analysed, some of the relict Ponto-Caspian fauna (species of Theodoxus, Gammaridae species, Paramysis, Pterocuma) is more abundant in the lakes from the north part of the Romanian littoral.

J	Ross, MJ; Curtsinger, JW; Megard, RO				Ross, MJ; Curtsinger, JW; Megard, RO			Development of population structure in Daphnia clones in a stratified lake	HEREDITY												The frequencies of single locus genotypes (clones) in a natural population of Daphnia pulicaria in a Minnesota lake were estimated during five months when the lake was thermally stratified in 1991. Further samples were collected in early August 1990 and 1992. Daphnia pulicaria were aggregated during daytime in two layers detected with high-frequency sonar. One layer was in the metalimnion and upper hypolimnion (depth 10-15 m), the other deeper in the hypolimnion (18-22 m). The layers were sampled at two locations in Long Lake on eight dates in 1991. Cellulose acetate electrophoresis revealed four alleles at the phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) locus. Three clones occurred with sufficient frequency in 3077 individuals for statistical analysis. The proportion of homozygous slow (SS) individuals increased with time in the deep layer at both locations, coincident with decreasing concentrations of dissolved oxygen, but was nearly constant in the shallower layer, where oxygen was near saturation. Analysis with log-linear statistics indicated that depth, date and the depth-date interaction were most important in explaining the variations in clone proportions during summer. Location and the date-location interaction, although significant, were less important. Data from early August 1990 and 1992 indicated that this pattern may be an annual phenomenon.																			0018-067X					SEP	1996	77		3				292	302																WOS:A1996VH04900008

In this study, we conducted a systematic investigation on grain size, total organic carbon (TOC), geochemistry, pollen and magnetic minerals of core PT sediments from the Zhengzhou region of the Henan Province in central China. Five units of sedimentary facies are identified as alluvial deposit, lacustrine deposit, swamp deposit, lacustrine deposit and alluvial deposit from bottom to top. Magnetic measurements indicate that magnetite and hematite dominate the magnetic mineral assemblages. The lacustrine and swamp deposits (1380-640 cm) were AMS C-14 dated to 5580-2670 yr BP and the chronology is further corroborated by the pedostratigraphic correlation to the adjacent cores in Zhengzhou region. Palynologically speaking, the period from 5580 to 5210 yr BP was characterized by lowest pollen percentages of Artemisia, Chenopodiaceae, Gramineae and Cyperaceae, higher values in clay contents, Sr contents and Fe/Mn ratios and also contents of magnetic mineral. The period from 5210 to 4760 yr BP was typified by rapid increases in Typha, Myriophyllum, Artemisia and Cyperaceae pollen percentages, gradual increases in ARM/SIRM and ARM/chi values, drastic drops in chi, ARM and SIRM values, with rather high values in clay contents, Sr contents and Fe/Mn ratios. The period between 4670 and 2670 yr BP was featured by gradual decreases in Gramineae, Artemisia, Typha and Myriophyllum pollen percentages, and increasing trends of chi, ARM and SIRM values, and decreasing trends of ARM/chi and ARM/SIRM values. Tracing the environmental changes since the mid-Holocene in the Zhengzhou region can provide an environmental reference for studying the human societal development in this birthplace of Chinese civilization.

Mapping Statistical Characteristics of Frosts in Iran	1ST ISPRS INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON GEOSPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				1st ISPRS International Conference on Geospatial Information Research	NOV 15-17, 2014	Tehran, IRAN	ISPRS				To model and map the statistical characteristics of frost in Iran, the data related to the minimum daily temperature for a 15-year period (1990-2005) was obtained from Iran Meteorological Organization. Then using multivariate regression models, the relationship among five statistical characteristics, i.e. the mean Julian day of the first frost, mean Julian day of the last frost, mean number of frost days per year, mean length of the frost period and mean length of growing season were modeled by three geo - climate factors: elevation, longitude and latitude. The precision of each model was explored using four hypotheses: linearity of the relationship between independent variables and the dependent variable, normality of errors, constancy of error variance and lake of correlation of errors were tested, and their precisions were confirmed. At the second stage, contour lines resulting from STRM were converted to the point features class. Altogether, 661'474 points were gathered from all over Iran. Then, the studied five frost characteristics were generalized to 661'474 points; then, the regionalization maps of statistical characteristics of frost were obtained for Iran using Kriging interpolation method. The results showed that the temperature of highland areas above 4'200 m above sea level always was at least zero and below zero during the year, and also the coastal strip of southern Iran had no frost. Elevation was the most effective factor in the spatial arrangement for the frequency of occurrence of Julian day of the first frost. The most effective factors in spatial arrangement for the frequency of occurrence of Julian day of the last frost, length of frost period and length of growing season were elevation and latitude. Finally, spatial arrangement for the frequency of occurrence of the frost days was also a function of three factors of elevation, longitude and latitude. The dominant role of elevation in spatial arrangement for the occurrence of the first frost day in Iran showed that the occurrence of the first frost day in Iran could be of the type of radiation frosts and the dominant role of elevation and latitude demonstrated that late-winter frosts can be mostly of the type of advection frosts. Therefore, arrangement of statistical features of frost in Iran is both a function of geo - climate factors and the synoptic systems which have entered the country.

Well-dated palynological records are available from the inland submediterranean zone, where evergreen broadleaved trees and shrubs are absent or rare, but less is known about the vegetation history of the coastal area. For instance, it is unclear when and why evergreen broadleaved vegetation expanded during the Holocene. Here we present a new record from a mesomediterranean site, Limni Volvi, near the coast of the Aegean Sea. To understand Holocene vegetation history, we combined palynology, microscopic charcoal analysis and biogeochemical proxies (Ti, Ca, RABD655-680max). At the start of the Holocene, open steppe vegetation and high fire activity prevailed around Limni Volvi. Afforestation by deciduous trees was likely delayed compared to sites further inland, due to the lack of moisture at the start of the Holocene, but vegetation composition was generally similar (i.e. submediterranean), with barely any evergreen broadleaved element. Around 8150 cal. BP (6200 cal. BC) trees and shrubs declined in the open woodlands or parklands, and the landscape returned to steppe conditions at 8000 cal. BP (6050 cal. BC), likely because of drier and colder conditions during the "8.2 ka event." Around the same time, cultural indicators suggest the start of Neolithic agriculture in the region. The present-day mesomediterranean vegetation with evergreen oaks only began to develop after 6000-5000 cal. BP (4050-3050 cal. BC), likely in response to increasing winter temperatures and reduced frost occurrence, further advantaged by human impact during the past 3600 years.

Disinfection treatments such as chlorination and UV-C treatment of drinking water are designed to remove microorganisms including microalgae and bacteria. In order to treat water efficiently it is critical to understand the effect of UV-C treatment on the viability and vitality of phytoplankton. Moreover, this information can be used to assess the utility of UV-C treatment as a potential pre-treatment option for water clean-up. In this study we tested the population growth of 6 phytoplankton species representing three major taxonomic groups (green algae, diatoms and cyanobacteria), commonly found in freshwater lakes in North America and relevant for water treatment facilities. We exposed these species to UV-C treatment and monitored their post-exposure population growth over a 52-55-day period using a plate-based MPN (most probable number) method. We found the green alga Scenedesmus quadricauda and the cyanobacterium Anabaena flos-aquae to be most tolerant to the treatment, while the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa and the diatom Asterionella formosa were found to be most sensitive with viability being reduced at comparatively lower doses. No significant delays in growth post treatment (i.e. time lags) were reported within species. Asterionella formosa and Aulacoseira granulata showed the longest time lags of all species, which might be in part correlated with DNA repair mechanisms and other physiological adaptations. This work provides the basis for the assessment of UV-C treatment efficacy on freshwater phytoplankton.

The native and introduced fishes of Clear Lake: a review of the past to assist with decisions of the future	CALIFORNIA FISH AND GAME												We reviewed the history of Clear Lake, California, and its fish community, including geology, Ethnology, aquatic biology, and human influences that have shaped the condition of the lake and the composition and abundance of native and introduced fish species. We summarized impacts experienced by the lake and its fish community, identified correlations between native fish abundance and non-native fish introductions and abundance, and described other human impacts. Causal relationships were difficult to ascertain from existing data, but we identified numerous research opportunities that would address these uncertainties, including: (1) field studies of Clear Lake hitch (Lavinia exilicauda chi) and largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) interactions; (2) field surveys to determine the current population dynamics of native fish species, including hitch, Sacramento blackfish (Orthodon microlepidotus), and Sacramento pikeminnow (Ptychocheilus grandis); (3) development of a hitch population dynamics model to explore the relative importance of potential bottlenecks in the species' life cycle; (4) development of a multi-species computer simulation model to bring together the existing knowledge about the Clear Lake ecosystem, and use of the model to simulate the results of management choices; (5) development of a watershed hydrology model, incorporating predictions of future climate through the 21st century, to predict how spring stream flows may change under climate change, and how this may affect hitch spawning access and timing; and, (6) conduct of a nation-wide survey of lake managers to identify management strategies that have been effective in delaying or halting the invasion of dreissenid mussels, and to discover how invasions have been addressed.																			0008-1078	2331-0405				WIN	2013	99	1					7	41																WOS:000318389300002

Photosynthesis of aquatic biota is known to play a crucial role in changing the concentration of carbon dioxide in the water. Fluorescent methods are considered to be of high performance in problems of determining quantitative characteristics of biomass, however they require preliminary calibration directly for a specific type of plankton. In the pelagic zone of Lake Baikal the species composition, quantitative and spatial distribution of phytoplankton are characterized by strong spatial and temporal variability. Therefore, the fluorescent devices calibration on a single reference does not provide acceptable accuracy of quantitative assessment of the biomass. The results discussed in the paper were obtained by shipboard measurements during the Baikal campaign of 2010-2011. Correlation between the biomass in 25-meter water layer and the integral value of the fluorescent signal in this layer was obtained for calibration. The report discusses the advantages and disadvantages of the chosen methods and the results of retrieval of the vertical profiles of the biomass for stations in the pelagic zone of Lake Baikal in spring for the 2010-2011 biennium.

The soricid community was made up of one large species (Blarina brevicauda), one medium-sized species (Cryptotis parva), and two small species (Sorex hoyi and S. longirostris). All species showed significant differences in frequency of capture in four of the five habitats, although there was considerable interspecific overlap in habitat use. Based on estimated age and time of capture, the major period of parturition for pygmy shrews was January through early March. Individuals entered the trappable population ca. 8 weeks later. Young pygmy shrews had attained adult body size by the time they entered the trappable population. Parturition also occurred from August through December, but at a lower rate, with few individuals born in June and July. Ninety-three pygmy shrews were captured, most from March through May. No pygmy shrews were captured from June through August, a period when 30.2% of 43 southeastern shrews were captured. These two species of small shrews, which were not significantly different in size on Land Between the Lakes, may partially segregate during summer, with pygmy shrews much less active above ground.																			0022-2372					MAY	1993	74	2					403	411		10.2307/1382396	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1382396													WOS:A1993LD67600017
J	Brooks, GR				Brooks, Gregory R.			Evidence of a strong paleoearthquake in ∼9.1 ka cal BP interpreted from mass transport deposits, western Quebec - northeastern Ontario, Canada	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												This paper reviews and expands upon stratigraphic and chronologic evidence supporting the interpretation of a strong, early postglacial paleoearthquake in western Quebec-northeastern Ontario, Canada. Event horizon mapping at Dasserat, Dufresnoy and Duparquet lakes, Quebec, coring at Chassignolle and Malartic lakes, Quebec, analysis of varve exposures near both the Twin Falls and Frederick House dams, Ontario, and review of published and unpublished logs of varve exposures, reveal that mass transport deposits formed in, or are inferred to have formed in, varve year (vyr) 1483 (relative to the Timiskaming varve series, and about 9.1 ka cal BP) are present at numerous locations within the study area. The spatial extent of the vyr 1483 mass transport deposit signature covers at least 14,600 km(2), and is best explained by shaking from a paleoearthquake. The magnitude of the event is estimated to be a minimum of M similar to 7.3, which is indicative of a strong paleoearthquake. The vyr 1483 paleoearthquake is one of 11 events of >= M similar to 5, occurring within a 425 varve year period between similar to 9.4 and 8.95 ka cal BP, and is likely part of a period of elevated, early postglacial, seismicity associated with rapid crustal unloading. The absence of an equivalent signature within the younger portion of the glaciolacustrine or lacustrine deposits in local lakes, implies that this paleoearthquake is the strongest to occur within the study area since about 9.1 ka cal BP. The highly-precise correlation of widely-spaced mass transport and disturbed deposits provided by varves is essential to the paleoearthquake interpretation.

J	Lisle, JT; Priscu, JC				Lisle, JT; Priscu, JC			The occurrence of lysogenic bacteria and microbial aggregates in the lakes of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												The McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica form the coldest and driest ecosystem on Earth. Within this region there arc a number of perennially ice-covered (3-6 m thick) lakes that support active microbial assemblages and have a paucity of metazoans. These lakes receive limited allochthonous input of carbon and nutrients, and primary productivity is limited to only 6 months per year owing to an absence of sunlight during the austral winters. In an effort to establish the role that bacteria and their associated viruses play in carbon and nutrient cycling in these lakes, indigenous bacteria, free bacteriophage, and lysogen abundances were determined. Total bacterial abundances (TDC) ranged from 3.80 x 10(4) to 2.58 x 10(7) cells mL(-1) and virus-like particle (VLP) abundances ranged from 2.26 x 10(5) to 5.56 x 10(7) VLP mL(-1). VLP abundances were significantly correlated (P < 0.05) with TDC, bacterial productivity (TdR), chlorophyll a (Chl a), and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP). Lysogenic bacteria, determined by induction with mitomycin C, made up between 2.0% and 62.5% of the total population of bacteria when using significant decreases and increases in TDC and VLP abundances, respectively, and 89.5% when using increases in VLP abundances as the sole criterion for a successful induction event. The contribution of viruses released from induced lysogens contributed <0.015% to the total viral production rate. Carbohydrate and protein based organic aggregates were abundant within the water column of the lakes and were heavily colonized by bacteria and VLPs. Alkaline phosphatase activity was detected within the matrix of the aggregates, implying phosphorus deficiency and consortial nutrient exchanges among microorganisms.																			0095-3628	1432-184X				MAY	2004	47	4					427	439		10.1007/s00248-003-1007-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-003-1007-x								15037960					WOS:000222608100013

Structural Impairment Detection of Tunnel Linings Using Ultrasonic Sensors	STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING 2013, VOLS 1 AND 2					9th International Workshop on Structural Health Monitoring (IWSHM)	SEP 10-12, 2013	Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA	AF Off Sci Res, Army Res Lab, Off Naval Res, Boeing, Airbus, Embraer	Stanford Univ			Tunnel inspection is a challenging problem since they typically service high volume traffic and operate in aggressive environments. Keeping tunnels open during inspection and minimizing tunnel closures and user delays must be carefully balanced with the need to conduct detailed inspections to ensure the safety of drivers. This paper describes tunnel lining impairment detection and evaluation that is performed in the Hanging Lake Tunnel near Glenwood Springs, Colorado, using air-coupled ground penetrating radar (GPR) and ultrasonic tomography (UST). Potential regions of interest to monitor are first identified using high-speed air-coupled GPR and visual inspection, and then the UST technique is used manually. This study shows that this particular combination of NDE techniques is a powerful tool for monitoring and assessing the condition of tunnel linings and can detect potential anomalies such as delamination, depth of surface cracks, reinforcement depth and layout, and lining thickness. Since typical tunnel lining evaluations only involve visual inspection and monitoring, distress observed is often the result of underlying damage that has gone undetected by the human eye. For this reason, structural impairment detection is needed to complement visual inspection in order to detect the beginning stages of damage before it inhibits serviceability requirements, or worse, becomes a public safety issue. When these early stages are identified by NDE methods before significant damage has taken place, preventive actions can be recommended that will arrest the development of further damage.

The results show major changes in the palaeogeographic setting of Lake Chokrak since the 3rd millennium B.C., when the postglacial marine transgression had started to fill the study area. Microfaunal analyses reveal the long persistence of an open marine embayment that only became separated from the Sea of Azov when a sand barrier developed during the late 2nd millennium B.C. When colonizing the Black Sea region after the 8th century B.C., the Greek settlers erected a fortification with a small settlement on a promontory that was by then a peninsula-like headland extending into the lake. The colonists abandoned their settlement at the end of the 1st millennium B.C. when the depth of the surrounding lake decreased from 1.5 m to less than 1 m. Today, Lake Chokrak dries up completely during summer. A detailed relative sea level (RSL) curve for the northern coast of Kerch has been established. Sea level reached its highest position at the present day. Since the 3rd millennium B.C., sea level continuously rose, without any of the previously postulated regression/transgression cycles. The RSL curve indicates differential subsidence rates within short distances in relatively stable areas, exceeding 40 cm per 1000 years. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The use of ultrafiltration to isolate high molecular weight dissolved organic matter (HMWDOM) from seawater is a fundamental tool in the environmental organic chemist's toolbox. Yet, important characteristics of HMWDOM relevant to its origin and cycling, such as its molecular weight distribution, remain poorly defined. We used diffusion-ordered NMR spectroscopy coupled with mixed-mode chromatography to separate and characterize two major components of marine HMWDOM: acylpolysaccharides (APS) and high molecular weight humic substances (HS). The molecular weights (MWs) of APS and HS both fell within distinct, narrow envelopes; 2.0-16 kDa for APS and 0.9-6.5 kDa for HS. In water samples from the North Pacific Ocean the average MW of both components decreased with depth through the mesopelagic. However, the minimum MW of APS was >2 kDa, well above the molecular weight cutoff of the ultrafilter, suggesting APS removal processes below 2 kDa are highly efficient. The MW distribution of APS shows only small variations with depth, while the MW distribution of HS narrowed due to removal of HMW components. Despite the narrowing of the MW distribution, the concentration of HS did not decrease with depth between 15 and 915 m. This suggests that HMW HS produced in surface waters was either degraded into lower MW compounds without significant remineralization, or that HMW HS was remineralized but replaced by an additional source of HS in the mesopelagic ocean. Based on these results, we propose potential pathways for the production and removal of these major components of HMWDOM.

Modeling nearshore total phosphorus in Lake Michigan using linked hydrodynamic and water quality models	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Although the offshore water of Lake Michigan has been below the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement (GLWQA) total phosphorus (TP) spring target concentration of 7 mu g L-1 for several decades, higher TP concentrations occur in the nearshore, contributing to the resurgence of Cladophora and other nutrient related issues. The most recent update of the GLWQA specifically calls for the assessment of current nearshore conditions. Such assessment would require an intensive monitoring program supported by water quality models. Here we applied multiple versions of a phosphorus-based model linked to an unstructured-grid hydrodynamic model. We focus on the nearshore regions of Lake Michigan around the Grand and Muskegon rivers - a region with strong riverine TP influence and intensive monitoring. Results from a TP model were compared to observational data and to a previously published Phosphorus-based Nutrient-Phytoplankton-Zooplankton-Detrital-Mussel (NPZDM) model. Model results and observational data show that parts of the nearshore can be well above the target TP concentrations but, due to the dynamic nature of this region, the TP concentrations can change rapidly. The models' skill statistics in predicting individual observations were variable, but it was able to simulate temporal and spatial trends and captured the distribution of observations in our study area. The similarity between the results of the TP and NPZDM models demonstrated the TP concentrations in this nearshore area are driven by hydrodynamics and river TP loads, which are likely the reasons for the higher observed TP concentrations. Simplicity, transparency, and ease of use of the TP model make it a useful tool for supporting nearshore assessments and estimating existing and future nearshore TP concentrations.

Brian; Svenning, Martin-Arne			Lepidurus arcticus (Crustacea : Notostraca); an unexpected prey of Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) in a High Arctic river	BOREAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												The phyllopod Lepidurus arcticus, commonly called the arctic tadpole shrimp, is an important food item of both Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus and brown trout Salmo trutta in lakes in Iceland and Scandinavia, especially at low fish densities. In the High Arctic, the tadpole shrimp is abundant in fishless localities, but absent or rare in most lakes where fish are present. We studied the diet of Arctic charr in the Straumsjoen watercourse on Spitsbergen, the main island of Svalbard. The outlet river is dry nine months of the year, and all Arctic charr present during summer have descended from the lake. We found that tadpole shrimp contributed substantially to the diet of charr in the outlet river, while it was not found in charr caught in the lake. Low fish density combined with low discharge after hatching of tadpole shrimp eggs may have favoured the co-occurrence of this lacustrine crustacean and Arctic charr in a running water locality. The potential effect of climate change on the occurrence of riverine tadpole shrimp is still uncertain. Retreat of glaciers and decreased turbidity may promote tadpole shrimp, but a predicted increase in precipitation may also have adverse impacts by increasing the risk of flushing tadpole shrimp out of the streams, and thus affecting the Arctic charr diet in running waters on Svalbard.																			1239-6095	1797-2469					2018	23						149	157																WOS:000458689100010

This study analyzed the effects of the interactions between wind-induced currents an1d waves on the driving mechanism of sediment resuspension in Lake Taihu, the third largest freshwater lake in China, using acoustic and optic techniques to collect long-term, high-frequency, synchronous in situ measurements of wind, currents, waves, and suspended solid concentrations (SSCs). The results suggested that water turbidity started to increase at wind speeds of approximately 4 m/s and significantly increased when wind speeds exceeded 6 m/s. In most cases, wind-induced waves were the main energy source for changes in turbidity. Wave-generated shear stress contributed more than 95% to sediment resuspension and that only in weak wind conditions (< 4 m/s) did the lake bottom shear stresses generated by currents and waves contributed equally. The relationship between SSC and bottom shear stress generated by wave was established by fitting the observed results. The processes of sediment dynamics were divided into four stages (A through D) according to three shear-stress thresholds. In stage A, SSC remained stable (about 45 mg/L) and tau(w) was less than 0.02 N/m(2). In stage B, the sediment bed was starting to be activated (SSC 45 similar to 60 mg/L) and tau(w) was in the range of 0.02 similar to 0.07 N/m(2). In stage C, a medium amount of sediment was suspended (SSC 60 similar to 150 mg/L) and tau(w) ranged from 0.07 to 0.3 N/m(2). In stage D, large amount of sediment was suspended (SSC 150 similar to 300 mg/L) and tau(w) was larger than 0.3 N/m(2). The findings of this paper reveal the driving mechanism of sediment resuspension, which may further help to evaluate internal nutrient release in large shallow Lake Taihu.					; Dai, Shujun/D-5777-2013; Wang, Jianwei/OCL-4610-2025	Tang, Chunyan/0000-0002-6803-0914; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				FEB	2017	24	4					4029	4039		10.1007/s11356-016-8165-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-8165-0								27924433					WOS:000397004600072

The multi-proxy record suggests that in the Oldest Dryas, the landscape around Lake Bled was rather open, presumably because of the cold and dry climate, with a trend towards wetter conditions, as suggested by an increase in tree pollen as well as chironomid and cladocera faunas typical for well-oxygenated water. Climatic warming at the beginning of the Late-glacial Interstadial at ca. 14,800 cal yr BP is suggested by an increase in the delta O-18 value, the appearance of Betula and Larix pollen and macrofossils, and a warmth-adapted chironomid fauna. With further warming at ca. 13,800 cal yr BP, broad-leaved tree taxa (Quercus, Tilia, Ulmus), Artemisia, and Picea increase, whereas chironomid data (Cricotopus B) suggest lowering of lake levels. After 12,800 cal yr BP (and throughout the Younger Dryas), the climate was colder and drier, as indicated by lower delta O-18 values, decline of trees, increase of microscopic charcoal, xerophytes and littoral chironomids. A warmer climate, together with the spread of broad-leaved tree taxa and a deeper, more productive lake, mark the onset of the Late-glacial/Holocene transition. These results suggest that terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems at Lake Bled were very dynamic and sensitive to Late-glacial climatic fluctuations.

The decomposition rate of Phragmites australis was determined as leaf mass loss from litterbags at 6 locations during summer 2000. Water temperature, dissolved oxygen, nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations, pH, conductivity, percent organic matter in sediments and effective fetch were also assessed at each site. Riparian factors (i.e. shoreline complexity, riparian vegetation cover, and distance from shoreline) were estimated from satellite images (Landsat VII). External organic loadings largely explained spatial heterogeneity in lake metabolism. Decomposition was fastest in the northern area of the lake that drained most of the watershed, including a larger portion in wetland area. Rates correlated exponentially with soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentration, and were positively associated with total-P (TP) concentration and organic matter percentage in sediments, which, in turn, were influenced by the riparian-related factors and waveexposure (fetch). A relationship existed between the index of riparian load, RL, which combined the three riparian-related factors, and both decomposition rate and SRP, suggesting that the riparian index is a promising cost-saving tool for monitoring lake function using remotely-sensed data.					; Rossi, David/L-1665-2019; Nascetti, Giuseppe/AAA-6396-2020	ROSSI, LORETO/0000-0001-8014-5397; Costantini, Maria Letizia/0000-0001-6242-558X; Rossi, David/0000-0002-9089-3257; Nascetti, Giuseppe/0000-0002-1159-8103													1015-1621	1420-9055					2007	69	4					503	510		10.1007/s00027-007-0917-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-007-0917-y													WOS:000251878800007

Internal N accumulation is minimal and the subsequent washout of ammonia-N and urea-N after return to control conditions is negligible, indicating that N excretion continues and (or) that N metabolism is markedly depressed. Exposure to 30 mmol.L-1 NH4Cl in a closed system without aeration results in depressed urea-N excretion. The lungfish greatly acid/fies the external water, a volume 25-fold greater than its own volume. The extent of this acidification increases with time. After several days, the external pH falls from about 7.0 to below 5.0 over a 24-h period, thereby markedly reducing the concentration of NH3 (the form that diffuses across biological membranes). CO2 excretion is partially responsible for this acidification, because vigorous water aeration reduces but does not eliminate the acidification, and urea-N excretion increases moderately. However, a substantial excretion of titratable acid (non-CO2 acidity) also occurs. One exceptional lungfish was able to maintain its aerated environment at a stable pH of 3.7. Environmental acidification may be a less costly strategy for avoiding toxicity than detoxifying ammonia by increasing urea production.					; Chew, Shit/I-2248-2012; Ip, Yuen Kwong/H-8041-2012; Wood, Chris/C-3021-2009; Ip, Yuen/H-8041-2012	Chew, Shit Fun/0000-0003-4599-5817; Wood, Chris/0000-0002-9542-2219; Ip, Yuen Kwong/0000-0001-9124-7911; 													0008-4301	1480-3283				APR	2005	83	4					507	517		10.1139/Z05-036	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/Z05-036													WOS:000230812000001
J	Glass, CF				Glass, CF			Enforcing Great Lakes water export restrictions under the Water Resources Development Act of 1986	COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW												Section 1109 of the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 establishes an unusual procedure meant to protect Great Lakes water levels: It requires that any plan to remove water from, the Great Lakes basin proceed only with the unanimous consent of the governors of all eight Great Lakes states. In 2002, the Western District of Michigan held in Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians v. Great Spring Waters of America, Inc. that section 1109 implies no private right of action by which a group of Michigan Indian tribes could enforce the statute; the court also cast doubt on the likelihood of the statute ever being enforced at all. This Note analyzes section 1109's enforceability problem. It describes barriers to both government and Private enforcement, particularly in light of collective action theory and recent Supreme Court decisions restricting the availability of Private rights of action and 1983 actions, and concludes that section 1109's dim prospects for enforcement render the statute an ineffective toot for protecting Great Lakes water. As a solution, this Note proposes that private citizens be given-preferably through congressional amendment or agreements currently being negotiated among the Great Lakes states, Ontario, and Quebec-the right to bring section 1109 enforcement actions.																			0010-1958	1945-2268				OCT	2003	103	6					1503	1537		10.2307/3593391	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3593391													WOS:000186243200003
J	Bührer, H; Ambühl, H				Bührer, H; Ambühl, H			Lake Lucerne, Switzerland, a long term study of 1961-1992	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Lake Lucerne. Switzerland. "Kreuztrichter"-basin, was investigated between 1961 and 1992. This time period offered a unique opportunity to study an eutrophication event lasting some ten years and the following recovery period as well as the limnological behavior of a deep pre-alpine lake. Results are presented as isopleths and long-term trends. Five year averages show clear patterns in the dynamics of ammonia or nitrite. Lake Lucerne (Kastanienbaum basin) is a monomictic lake. with only one complete overturn every six years. Other basins of Lake Lucerne such as the southernmost basin (Lake Uri), destratify each year, because of its wind-channel orientation. Kreuztrichter Basin was physically stabilized for years by trophic-induced processes. As the take recovered. the density gradient in the bottom water layer decreased and turnover frequency increases. The oxygen peak in summer was usually overridden by temperature effects. Nitrogen concentration increased steadily during the 30 year period. Data for N, P, Si and O-2 suggested the concept of compensation depth could be applied. The results were e. g. settling seston had no effect on nitrogen but caused a decrease in soluble phosphorus. In the most productive years silica use was more intense. The abyssal part of the wind-shielded Weggis-Vitznau basin is the most sensitive spot to the effects of nutrients in the lake.

Critical questions include the following: What are the rates and mechanisms of materials and energy exchange, and in what ways does the exchange impact ecosystem functioning? To address these questions, we built a simple model of a hypothetical reach of the Lower Mississippi River (LMR) containing a single backwater. The model is based on empirical data obtained from the LMR system. Our primary objectives for the model were to assess potential backwater impacts on river nitrate transport and in subsidizing phytoplankton biomass to the main channel. Simulations run over a 10-year period suggest that on an annual basis, (a) LMR backwaters remove NO3-N, and it would require a temporal mean of 34,400 ha functioning like the model backwater, or 2.8 times the current area of oxbow lakes, to eliminate 100% of the river flux of NO3-N of our study region; (b) it would require inputs of phytoplankton from a mean of 5,242 ha of sites functioning like the model backwater to produce observed river flux of phytoplankton biomass; and (c) backwater function is sensitive to the controlling elevation in linking channels hence subject to management. Although simple, this model is a useful first step in quantifying the significance of river-backwater connectivity on ecological processes of the LMR system.

One year after H verticillata seedlings were transplanted into the microcosms, growth and physio-biochemical characters of the plants were estimated. In our study, sludge sediment eventually promoted the increase of the biomass, shoot length, bifurcation. nitrogen, phosphorus, soluble protein content of H. verticillata. but not root number and root mass ratio Additionally, the soluble sugar content was significantly lower in summer (August) in the sludge sediment Sediment nutrients also increased photosynthetic pigment content, while POD and SOD activities were not affected. The fertile sludge and brown clay formed by different dredging are quite different, but both sediments could meet the requirement of H verticillata during early growth stage. The fertile sediment after moderate dredge-up fit the growth of H. verticillata. The brown clay formed after excessive dredging showed a lack of nutrients and therefore led to the weak growth of the aquatic plants. It is concluded that moderate dredging was suitable for H verticillata growth and for absorbing nitrogen and phosphorus from eutrophic fresh water. The experiment also suggested that submersed aquatic plant restoration in freshwater can be promoted by human assistance. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

It is usually reported in people engaged in recreational water activities in freshwater bodies and in most of cases, it is provoked by bird schistosomes of the genus Trichobilharzia. In the summer 2017, many cases of dermatitis were recorded in people bathing in the waters of the Albano Lake (Rome, Italy) and a parasitological investigation was carried out in order to ascertain the causative agent of these cases. Snails of the family Lymnaeidae, natural intermediate hosts of bird schistosomes, were collected from lake shallow waters to detect the presence of trematodes of the genus Trichobilharzia. Pools of maximum 10 snails were placed in Petri dishes, and cercarial emergence was stimulated exposing snails to strong artificial light intensity at 25 degrees C. Three hundred and thirty-seven snails were collected and screened for the shedding of cercariae. Furcocercariae of the family Schistosomatidae, with a morphology overlapping that of the genus Trichobilharzia, were detected in seven Petri dishes. Assuming that in each positive Petri dish just one snail was shedding furcocercariae, the minimum infectious rate was 2.1%. Molecular analysis of furcocercariae allowed ascribing them to the species Trichobilharzia franki. Snails of the species Radix auricularia were identified as intermediate hosts of the parasite. This is the second record of T. franki causing cercarial dermatitis in Central Italy, the third in Italy. The 2017 was in Italy exceptionally warm and dry. Trematodes are sensitive to changes in temperature, being cercarial production and emission rates temperature dependent. Small increases in water temperature would speed up parasite development and transmission, leading to a manifold increase in cercarial emergence. Moreover, high temperatures raise chances to acquire the infection, due to increased time spent in water by people.

We created a GIS that included landscape information and water-quality data from a 9-year synoptic survey of 105 coastal marshes covering 28 quaternary watersheds. Multiple regressions and partial correlations were used to discern confounding effects of human-induced (road density) versus natural physical watershed determinants of water quality. Road density was the dominant factor influencing many water quality variables, showing positive correlations with specific conductivity (COND), total suspended solids (TSS), and inorganic suspended solids (ISS) and a negative correlation with overall Water Quality Index scores. Road density also showed positive correlations with total nitrate nitrogen (TNN) and total phosphorus (TP). By comparison, larger watershed area was the main factor leading to elevated TP concentrations. The proportion of the watershed occupied by wetlands explained the largest amount of variation in TNN concentrations (negative correlation) and was also negatively correlated with COND and positively correlated with TSS and ISS when we controlled for road density. Bedrock type did not have a significant effect in any of the models. Our findings suggest that road density is currently the overriding factor governing water quality of coastal marshes in Georgian Bay during the summer low-flow period. We recommend that natural variation in physical watershed characteristics be considered when developing water quality standards and management practices for freshwater coastal areas.																			0364-152X					SEP	2009	44	3					456	467		10.1007/s00267-009-9338-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-009-9338-0								19597867					WOS:000268901300006

BIOMASS AND GROSS PRODUCTION OF ALGAE	JAPANESE JOURNAL OF CROP SCIENCE												The biomass and photosynthesis of algae in a paddy field were examined during the entire rice-growing season. The total algal biomass expressed as the amount of chlorophyll-a(chl-a) per unit land area was small in the early season, increased with time and attained the highest value at the last stage of rice growth. The values ranged from 30-183 mg chl-a/m depending on the time. In the early season, benthic algae were dominant, and in the later season semi-benthic, i.e., filamentous algae predominated. The alteration in dominant species was considered to be brought about by lowering water temperature with time. The algal photosynthetic rate varied in phase with intensity of photosynthetically active radiation incident on water surface (PARt). The amplitude of the diurnal cycles of the photosynthetic rate on unit land area basis was large in the early season and diminished with time as the rice canopy closed. No sign of saturation was detected in the light-photosynthesis relationship in the range of light intensity attained. The slope of the light-photosynthesis curve on a chl-a basis became steeper with time. Daily gross photosynthesis was largest at the earliest period of the rice-growing season (881 mgC/m2 per day) and decreased with time. In the last period it fell to a level of 300-400 mgC/m2 per day. The efficiency of photosynthetically active radiation energy for gross production was low in the early season (0.24-0.42%), increased with time and attained the highest value at the last stage (4.78%). The turnover rate of algal C was high at the early stages (0.30 per day) and decreased with time. At the last stage, it was only 0.046 per day. This low turnover rate might explain why algal biomass increased with time in the later half of rice growing season in spite of reduction in the daily gross production caused by decline in PARt. The total gross production in the whole experimental period (144 days) amounted to 71 gC/m2 per day. The magnitude is comparable to that for eutrophic lakes.																			0011-1848						1980	49	1					146	155																WOS:A1980JY65000020
J	Pardee, G				Pardee, Galen			The Great Lakes Architectural Expedition and the environmental-scale interior	INTERIORS-DESIGN ARCHITECTURE CULTURE												Conflict around water supply is perhaps one of the oldest continual sources of tension between social groups; however, few contemporary situations embody the complexities and pitfalls of regulating access to a shared public good than the saga of North American Great Lakes. From a graphic perspective, objects of interest range from water bottles to cities, and from the drama of the Niagara Falls to minor changes in slope separating drainage basins from one another. As such, in order to represent stakeholders and events in a manner befitting their importance, some sacrifices to scale and orthography are required. The drawings, maps, and models produced for a series of exhibitions represent a trans-scalar graphic commentary, underlining the ripple effects and stakeholders as decisions around the Lakes' water and infrastructure take effect, eschewing geographical fidelity in favor of representing the ecological and political truths that undergird the modern Great Lakes and allow one to understand the power dynamics at play. The essay accompanying these photographs explores the justifications and research behind these heterodox approaches to graphic conventions, and how letting go of "impartial" aspects of architectural representation can lead to better arguments, stronger narratives, and a more resilient understanding of the world around us.																			2041-9112	2041-9120				SEP 1	2024	14	1-3					199	212		10.1080/20419112.2025.2464997	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20419112.2025.2464997		FEB 2025											WOS:001435646100001

Updated occurrence data and species distribution modeling of the invasive amphipod Apocorophium lacustre in North America	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Freshwater ecosystems in North America have been greatly affected by invasive species, including invasive amphipods, which has motivated the development of predictive models to inform where invaders are likely to establish. Here, we provide the first predictive model using freshwater-specific habitat layers for the non-native amphipod Apocorophium lacustre (Vanhoffen, 1911) in the Mississippi, Laurentian Great Lakes, and Upper Saint Lawrence river basins, USA, and evaluate its current distribution in the Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS), Illinois, USA. In the summers of 2017, 2018, and 2019, we sampled for A. lacustre at 45 sites in the CAWS. Next, we used boosted regression trees to develop an ensembled species distribution model combining A. lacustre occurrence data with the EarthEnv GIS layers to model habitats suitable for this species. We did not find A. lacustre at any of our sampling sites in the CAWS in 2017 nor 2018, but we did find the species at 7 sites in 2019. Our ensemble species distribution model evaluated habitat associations and predicted the potential distribution of A. lacustre with an average area-under-the-curve value of 0.996 and an average true skills statistic of 0.956. The model predicts that A. lacustre could establish throughout much of the Mississsippi River basin and in the Upper Saint Lawrence River basin. These predictions of habitat suitability for A. lacustre can guide management efforts by facilitating monitoring and early detection to prevent further spread and establishment of this species.																			2161-9549	2161-9565				MAR 1	2021	40	1					162	174		10.1086/713071	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/713071		MAR 2021											WOS:000621569600002

A combined GPR and SNMR monitoring of a drained intraglacial water pocket located into the polythermal glacier of Tete Rousse	2015 8TH INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON ADVANCED GROUND PENETRATING RADAR (IWAGPR)					8th International Workshop on Advanced Ground Penetrating Radar (IWAGPR)	JUL 07-10, 2015	Firenze, ITALY	IEEE				Formation of intraglacial lakes in polythermal glaciers results from specific climatic, topographic and aspect conditions. Their occurrence constitutes a significant threat to the valleys located below in case of sudden discharge occurring without any warning prior signs. Such case occurred in 1892 at Saint-Gervais (French Alps), where a deadly water wave reached the town a few tens of minutes after a water-filled cavity ruptured within the Tete Rousse glacier located upstream. Further multi-method investigations of this glacier began from 2007, based initially from surface Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) imaging and then supplemented with Surface Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (SNMR) surveys and borehole measurements. These combined study allowed first to detect and characterize a water-filled water pocket located 40 m below the surface within the glacier, and second to monitor its changes after water was drained in fall 2010 to reduce risk. Here, we will present the main GPR results obtained in this unique and complex 3D case, which will be quantitatively compared with other geophysical and borehole measurements. This case study shows the potential of combining GPR and SNMR methods for the study of polythermal glaciers.

Thirty-five percent of the pure cultures isolated in 1997 from pack ice floes north of Svalbard and in the Fram Strait were from the beta-proteobacteria group. Within this group, there were only two phylotypes clustering within the widespread Beta I cluster, also known as the Comamonadaceae clade. One phylotype, most closely related to Aguaspirilltan arcticum (96.0-97.3% identical), was frequent among cultures isolated from 10 melt pools. A 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene clone library, constructed from a melt pool that was sampled 2 yr later in the Fram Strait. was also dominated by beta-proteobacteria, in particular the same recurrent isolate phylotype designated "MP-BetaI". Fluorescence in situ hybridization of 20 melt pools corroborated the cultivation and cloning data. beta-Proteobacteria were the most abundant bacterial group, constituting similar to49% of the bacteria that were stained by 4'6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). alpha- and gamma-proteobacteria accounted for only 2% each, the Cytophaga-Flavobacteritan group accounted for 9%, and the Actinobacteria spp. accounted for 9%. Approximately 63% of the beta-proteobacterial fraction that was found in the melt pools was determined with a newly developed probe to be the recurrent beta-proteobacterial MP-Betal phylotypes, indicating that it is particularly adapted for success in this extreme environment.

Cold Resistance and Wintering of the Common Viper (Vipera berus, Reptilia, Viperidae) on Kizhi Island, Karelia	BIOLOGY BULLETIN												The geographic distribution of the common viper, Vipera berus (L. 1758), was believed to be limited in the north and northeast by an assumed lack of hibernacula with temperatures exceeding 0 degrees C, because the species is not freeze-tolerant. To test this hypothesis, we measured in the laboratory the cold resistance of vipers that inhabit Kizhi Island (Lake Onega, Karelia, Russian North), and compared the results obtained with the temperatures in the hibernacula and soils of the region. Freezing of the adults happened at an average temperature of -3.0 degrees C (ranging from -2 to -3.9 degrees C). Vipera berus failed to tolerate complete freezing, but could withstand short-term (1-8 hours) partial freezing. At subzero temperatures (-2 to -2.2 degrees C), animals remained supercooled for 23-121 days. Vipers remained active at temperatures dropping down to -1.5 degrees C, moving in experimental containers; this possibly happens in overwintering places as well. Our study allows us to conclude that the species' ability to withstand long-term supercooling (up to four months) is one of the key determinants of the adaptive strategy of the common viper in cold regions. The critical temperature of the species in overwintering sites must be considered to be not 0 degrees C, but -2 degrees C. This threshold temperature can be a factor limiting the geographic distribution of V. berus. Temperatures in hibernacules on Kizhi Island (heapes of stones) and also possibly in all soils of Karelia are favorable for the species' overwintering, leading to its great abundance levels.					; Bulakhova, Nina/S-3039-2017	Bulakhova, Nina/0000-0002-3000-6476; 													1062-3590	1608-3059				DEC	2021	48	7					1022	1029		10.1134/S1062359021070074	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1062359021070074													WOS:000731282600015

Reducing conditions in soil of Gallocanta Lake, northeast Spain	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE												Saline wetlands have received limited attention from researchers and this neglect has often resulted in their degradation and limited conservation, and insufficient information to design conservation and management plans. Gallocanta Lake is a nature reserve of international importance for winter birds. The importance of the soil here, which supports niches and protected habitats for certain species of birds, has been recognized more recently. The soil of Gallocanta Lake undergoes strong oscillations of saturation and drainage followed by drying because of irregular rain and variable flooding conditions associated with fluctuations in the level of the lake. This study examined reducing conditions and morphological indicators of reduction in the soil around the lake with indicators of reduction in soils (IRIS) tubes, which are coated with iron oxides. We surveyed five sites for between 22 and 34weeks. The average amount of iron removed from the IRIS tubes during the period studied ranged between 4 and 96%. The intensity of reduction in the soil differs according to subtle topographic differences between sites; it increases with the decrease in elevation. The large soil salinity (electrical conductivity saturated soil extract, ECe, from 18.1 to 182dSm(-1)), carbonate-rich composition (from 18.4 to 69.7% calcium carbonate equivalent, CCE) and overall small organic matter content (from 0.4 to 6.2% organic matter) do not seem to constrain iron mobilization because of the reducing conditions. Differences in iron depletion and patterns on the IRIS tubes show the heterogeneity of soil conditions and the complexity of factors involved in redox processes. Further research is needed to gain knowledge of the redox processes in the context of pedogenesis in semiarid lacustrine environments.

J	Ayenew, T; Demlie, M; Wohnlich, S				Ayenew, Tenalem; Demlie, Molla; Wohnlich, Stefan			Application of Numerical Modeling for Groundwater Flow System Analysis in the Akaki Catchment, Central Ethiopia	MATHEMATICAL GEOSCIENCES												A three dimensional steady-state finite difference groundwater flow model is used to quantify the groundwater fluxes and analyze the subsurface hydrodynamics in the Akaki catchment by giving particular emphasis to the well field that supplies water to the city of Addis Ababa. The area is characterized by Tertiary volcanics covered with thick residual and alluvial soils. The model is calibrated using head observations from 131 wells. The simulation is made in a two layer unconfined aquifer with spatially variable recharge and hydraulic conductivities under well-defined boundary conditions. The calibrated model is used to forecast groundwater flow pattern, the interaction of groundwater and surface water, and the effect of pumping on the well field under different scenarios. The result indicates that the groundwater flows regionally to the south converging to the major well field. Reservoirs and rivers play an important role in recharging the aquifer. Simulations made under different pumping rate indicate that an increase in pumping rate results in substantial regional groundwater level decline, which will lead to the drying of springs and shallow hand dug wells. Also, it has implications of reversal of flow from contaminated rivers into productive aquifers close to main river courses. The scenario analysis shows that the groundwater potential is not enough to sustain the ever-growing water demand of the city of Addis Ababa. The sensitivity and scenario analysis provided important information on the data gaps and the specific sites to be selected for monitoring, and may be of great help for transient model development. This study has laid the foundation for developing detailed predictive groundwater model, which can be readily used for groundwater management practices.

Based on morphological and molecular analyses, the causative organism has been identified as a new woloszynskioid dinoflagellate, Tovellia diexiensis Q. Zhang et G.X. Liu sp. nov. The vegetative cells are 20-32 mu m long and 16-24 mu m wide. They have a hemispherical episome and a broadly rounded hyposome with a short characteristic antapical spine. Usually cells are bright red due to the presence of numerous red-pigmented bodies, which often masked the yellowish green discoid chloroplasts. The amphiesma of motile cells comprise mainly quadrilateral, pentagonal or hexagonal thin plates, arranged in 4-5 latitudinal series on the episome, 1 in the cingulum and 4 on, the hyposome. Molecular phylogenies based on small subunit ribosomal DNA and large subunit ribosomal DNA (LSU) indicate T diexiensis from Baishihai Lake to belong to the family Tovelliaceae, which was monophyletic in our LSU phylogenies. During the bloom-forming period in 2005, cell density of T diexiensis reached 9.15 x 10(5) cells L-1. Astaxanthin and its diester were found to be the major pigments in T diexiensis, resulting in a characteristic blood-red color of the water in Baishihai Lake.

The scales were usually abundant and were always well preserved. The Adirondack flora is typical of acidic to circumneutral oligotrophic lakes. Common taxa include Mallomonas acaroides, M. caudata, M. crassisquama, M. hamata, M. pseudocoronata, M. punctifera, Synura echinulata, S. petersenii, S. sphagnicola, S. spinosa and Chrysosphaerella longispina. The abundance of certain species (e.g., M. hindonii, M. hamata) appears to be a reliable indication of acidic waters. Reciprocal averaging (RA) ordination was used to determine if distribution of the mallomonadacean assemblages corresponded with major environmental gradients. Correlations between the 1st RA axis scores and lakewater pH (r2 = 0.63) and related factors (log10 alkalinity, r2 = 0.66; pCa, r2 = 0.39; pMg, r2 = 0.43) were strongest. Relationships were weaker with average depth, summer epilimnion temperature, elevation, NO3 and total Al, and were not statistically significant with conductivity, color, Secchi disc transparency, total P, chlorophyll a, SO4 and Si. Cluster analysis grouped both lakes and taxa into categories best explained by their pH-related characteristics. Analysis of surficial sediment from lakes with known limnological characteristics is a useful approach for the study of the ecology and taxonomy of the Mallomonadaceae. Mallomonadacean distributions evidently reflect lake conditions and are potentially useful indicators in limnological and paleolimnological studies.					; Smol, John/A-8838-2015; Charles, Donald/AAG-1164-2020	Charles, Donald/0000-0002-0373-0274; Smol, John/0000-0002-2499-6696; 													0008-4026						1984	62	5					911	923		10.1139/b84-130	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b84-130													WOS:A1984SU75200005

Principles, design and processes of integrated agricultural research for development: experiences and lessons from LKPLS under the SSACP	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS-AFJARE												With increasing recognition holding the promise of overcoming the outstanding problems faced by African agriculture, IAR4D faces the danger of being 'blurred' by past approaches and falling short of its potential to deliver the desired impacts in diverse multi-stakeholder, biophysical, socio-economic, cultural, technological and market contexts unless its actualisation and working is clearly understood. In this paper, we present the conceptualisation and principles of and knowledge-based experiences and lessons from the implementation of the sub-Saharan Africa Challenge Programme (SSACP) in the Lake Kivu Pilot Learning Site (LKPLS). The presentation covers the formation and facilitation of IPs for the actualisation of IAR4D to evolve mechanisms for the early recognition of interlinked issues in natural resource management, productivity and value addition technologies, markets, gender and policy arrangements. These have autonomously triggered flexible, locally directed interactions to innovate options from within or outside their environment for resolving the challenges, and have moved along a new institutional and technological change trajectory. Emerging lessons point to the endowment of IP members with self-help knowledge interactions, training in IAR4D, quality of facilitation and research to be key determinants of the power behind of self-regulating mechanisms.					; Fungo, Bernard/LEM-3564-2024; Njuki, Jemimah/AAE-5979-2020	Musana Segatagara, Bernard/0000-0002-1498-2661; Fungo, Bernard/0000-0002-2799-8910													1993-3738					SEP	2013	8	3			SI		81	100																WOS:000219940600002

Environmental and climate reconstruction of the late-glacial-Holocene transition from a lake sediment sequence in Aubrac, French Massif Central: Chironomid and diatom evidence	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The analysis of fossil chironomid and diatom assemblages from a sedimentary record from Les Roustieres peat bog (Massif Central, France, 1196 m asl) allows the reconstruction of past environmental and climate changes during the late-glacial and early Holocene. Chironomid assemblages showed that the infilling of the palaeolake had commenced during the Oldest Dryas (GS-2b) as suggested by the rapid decrease in chironomid species associated with the cold and deep zone of lakes and by their replacement by littoral and eutrophic taxa. Quantitative July temperature reconstructions, based on the chironomid data, suggest that mean July air temperature (Tjul) ranged between 6 degrees C and 11 degrees C at the termination of the Oldest Dryas period (GS-2b). Climate began to warm at the start of the Bolling period (GI-1e), between 15,000 and 14,800 cal yr BP, with a rise in Tjul of about 4 degrees C. This climate warming is contemporaneous with lake eutrophication as suggested by diatoms and chironomids. Maximum temperatures of 13-14 degrees C were reached around 13,600 cal yr BP during the Allered period (GI-1c-GI-1a). The Younger Dryas period (GS-1) is marked by a return to cold conditions with Tjul of about 10 degrees C during a first phase, then 13 degrees C in its terminal part. A probable increase in the duration of the ice-cover may have favoured arctic and alpine diatom species. The early-Holocene climate improvement is marked by a rise in Tjul of about 3 degrees C.

This study offers a basic climatology of CAPs in the southern Spanish Plateau and investigates its evolution since 1961 and their links with local, synoptic, and large-scale climate variability. It is based on the comparison of meteorological records from two stations, one in the Sistema Central Range (Navacerrada, 1,894 m asl) and another at the plain (Madrid-Barajas, 609 m asl). Accuracy and representativeness of both locations to depict the spatial and temporal variability of CAPs was also tested. CAPs days (defined as the simultaneous occurrence of a daily minimum temperature difference above 0.1 degrees C between both stations) were found to occur year-round, but the most frequent and intense occur in winter (NDJ). Some typical features of CAPs, such as local mesoscale processes (katabatic and anabatic flows) in connection with synoptic (advection of mid-troposphere warm air masses during high-pressure regimes) and hemispheric (a positive phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation) variability were also observed, leading to a sheltered boundary layer at the bottom of southern Spanish Plateau, decoupled from the free troposphere. By night, CAPs have maintained both their frequency and intensity, which means that the frequency of extremely cold nights on the plain has remained relatively stable (despite global warming). By day, an enhanced warming of the high-elevation site has increased the temperature difference between the mountains and the plain during CAP days.					; Allende, Fernando/B-2167-2013; Martilli, Alberto/H-5426-2015	Allende Alvarez, Fernando/0000-0002-9941-8022; 													0899-8418	1097-0088				JAN	2023	43	1					38	56		10.1002/joc.7700	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/joc.7700		JUN 2022											WOS:000806739600001
J	Park, J; Shin, YH; Byrne, R				Park, Jungjae; Shin, Young Ho; Byrne, Roger			Late-Holocene vegetation and climate change in Jeju Island, Korea and its implications for ENSO influences	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Several recent studies suggest the hypothesis that the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is an important factor controlling the Holocene East Asian Monsoon (EAM). However, the mechanism underlying this influence remains unclear due to the lack of high-resolution paleoclimate records from the coast of East Asia. Here, we provide a new record of late Holocene climate change in coastal East Asia based on multi-proxy evidence (pollen, organic content, magnetic susceptibility, grain size) obtained from a sediment core from Jeju Island, South Korea. As Jeju Island is strongly influenced by the Kuroshio flow, our sediment proxy records contain ENSO signals from the tropical Pacific. The study area was affected by dry/cool conditions in the western tropical Pacific (WTP) between 4350 and 1920 cal yr BP when El Ninos were frequent, and by rapid warming/wetting and forestation since 1920 cal yr BP when La Ninas were more common. Jeju Island was relatively dry/cool between 2100 and 1600, 1300-1200, 1100-1000, 800-650, and 300-50 cal yr BP, as opposed to the Galapagos Islands, which were relatively wet/warm, reflecting the ENSO-related negative correlation between eastern and western margins of Pacific. Wet conditions may have prevailed during the early Little Ice Age (LIA) (620-280 cal yr BP) despite consistent cooling. This period of high precipitation may have been associated with the increased landfall of typhoons and with warmer Kuroshio currents under La Nina-like conditions. According to our results, EAM on the East Asian coastal margin was predominantly driven by ENSO activity, rather than by the precession effect. Paleoclimatic data from Jeju Island, with its insular position and closeness to warm Kuroshio currents, provide clear evidence of these ENSO influences. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, how the temporal dynamics of phytoplankton are directly or indirectly linked to anthropogenic activities and climatic oscillation remains unclear. We assessed the annual trends (1988-2018) in phytoplankton abundance (PA) in Lake Dongting, China and related it to five groups of variables characterizing human activities, global climate oscillation, water nutrients, hydrology, and meteorology. We found a significant increase in PA, urbanization (Upop), total nitrogen (TN), fertilizer application (FA), number of summer days (SU), and the warm speed duration index (WSDI) and a significant decrease in the water discharge of three inlets (TIWD) and the sediment discharge of three inlets (TISD) and four tributaries (FTSD) and the net sediment deposition (NSD). However, no significant annual trends were observed for the number of rainstorm days (R50mm), the simple precipitation intensity index (SDII) and yearly anomalies of El Nino-Southern oscillation events (ENSOi). Cross-correlation Function analyses demonstrated that the operation of the Three George Dam (TGD) strengthened the effects of hydrology, rainfall patterns and ENSOi on phytoplankton, but strongly weakened the association between water nutrients, human activities and phytoplankton abundance. Path analysis revealed that TP, TN, FA, R50 mm as well as WSDI had a direct positive effect on PA, while a direct negative effect was found for ENSOi, NSD and TISD. Human activities (Upop and FA), warming (WSDI and SU), and rainfall patterns (SDII and R50 mm) exerted indirect controls on phytoplankton through changes in water nutrients and hydrology. Climate change (ENSOi) had a direct effect on PA, but also showed twelve indirect pathways via changes in hydrology and meteorology (both positive and negative effects were found). Overall, meteorology contributed most markedly to the variations of PA (29.3%), followed by hydrology (25.3%), human activities (24%), water nutrients (10.5%), and ENSOi (1.9%). Our results highlight a strongly causal connection between human activities as well as global climate change and phytoplankton and the benefits of considering multiple environmental drivers in determining the temporal dynamics of lake biotic communities.

Carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes of the lakeshore sediments still remain poorly represented and understood, with important implications for the global carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) budget closures. This study quantifies spatiotemporal dynamics and (non-)linear drivers of CO2, CH4, and N2O effluxes from sediments of 20 lakes along wet-dry lakeshore, diurnal, and ecoregional gradients in the western part of Turkey. Mean daily CO2, CH4, and N2O effluxes were estimated at 98.64 ? 386.47, 1.42 ? 1.71, and 0.12 ? 0.24 from wet sediments and at 393.60 ? 386.94, 0.82 ? 1.58, and 0.24 ? 0.22 from dry sediments, with an overall mean of 242.28 ? 404.1, 1.09 ? 1.53, and 0.18 ? 0.23 mmol m- 2 d-1, respectively. The variability in the GHG effluxes was most sensitive to the interaction between latitude and wet-dry location. Out of 14 significant environmental drivers, the most important ones that minimized and maximized CO2, CH4, and N2O effluxes were PO4?P content, three-summer month standardized precipitation index, and redox potential, respectively, based on a random forest-based optimization.

However, our understanding of how the development of pastoralism affected societal changes during the historical period has been constrained by the paucity of historical documents and reliable and continuous records of grazing activity. Here, we utilize high-resolution records of coprophilous fungal spores from Tian'E Lake and Gonghai Lake in northern China, to reconstruct changes in grazing intensity during the Tang Dynasty. We compared our results with palaeoclimate reconstructions and documentary evidence of societal changes, to evaluate linkages among the natural environment, subsistence strategies, and the rise and fall of the Tang Dynasty. Based on structural equation modelling, we hypothesize that intensive pastoralism under a warm and wet climate facilitated the rise of the Tang Dynasty. We also infer that horse rearing played a crucial role in promoting the stability and rise of society in China during this period. This study contributes to an understanding of the relationships between pastoralism and the level of socioeconomic development, as well as military strength, during the pre-industrial period.																			0939-6314	1617-6278				2025 JUL 31	2025										10.1007/s00334-025-01057-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00334-025-01057-4		JUL 2025											WOS:001540816500001

North American River Otters Followed by Piscivorous Birds, and a River Otter Parental Distraction Display	NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST												We observed 2 Lontra canadensis (North American River Otter), likely an adult female and her nearly-grown pup, on a fall 2018 afternoon at a remote lake in Piscataquis County, ME. We witnessed 2 notable animal behaviors, a possible bird-otter foraging association and a River Otter parental display, serendipitously while canoeing. An Andea herodias (Great Blue Heron) and a Alegaceryle alcyon (Belted Kingfisher) watched and followed the River Otters as they fished along the shore of a small cove of the lake. Although neither bird was seen to strike directly at or eat a fish during this episode, the behavior of the piscivorous birds was suggestive of a foraging association with the River Otters, a novel observation in North America. After fishing, the River Otters began traveling along the lake shore and noticed the canoeing human observers. Upon becoming aware of the canoe, the pup apparently hid as the adult female swam toward the canoe while noisily blowing. She then dove and resurfaced farther away from her pup's last-seen position. This routine was repeated several times until the observers paddled away from the female. Despite the large behavioral repertoire known for otters generally, this parental distraction display has not been previously reported.

J	Rewers, E				Rewers, Ewa			Urban soundscape with water in the lead role	AVANT												The concept of urban acupuncture as an essential component of urban planning is not new. Skillfully designed aural architecture have long been appreciated for their social, community and aesthetic value. By focusing on aural architecture cities can provide original and effective projects from the therapeutic-progressive perspective. Aural works of architecture and art refer to the human and non-human sensories. They are broadening the experience of sound-in-space. To discuss aural architecture in urbanocene requires the development of a comprehensive symbolic - both visual and acoustic - imaginary. By accepting of the concept of "culturenature" designers branch out sensory cultures (e.g. hydro-cultures) and investigate "culturalnatural" sound sources. In a current projects they tested hydro-sounds in particular urban high-noise an quiet soundscapes. It is another thing to address hydro-sounds in environmenatally responsible ways through best architectural and artistic practices that control, invent and arrange the ecological health of urban sites. This article offers a cultural analysis of the urban hydro-sounds design strategies used in a few innovative projects by space planners, architects, sculptors, musicians and acousticians in the 21st century. The results are precedent-setting propositions that employ lakes, rivers, rainwater, fountains and water-falls design strategies in artful and therapeutic ways.																			2082-7598	2082-6710					2020	11	3								10.26913/avant.2020.03.38	http://dx.doi.org/10.26913/avant.2020.03.38													WOS:000609061000014

The average concentration of Hg in surface snow/ice was 22.41 ng L-1, while the percentage of dissolved mercury (Hg-D) was observed to be around 26%. An altitudinal magnification of Hg was not observed for surface snow; however, in contrast, a significant positive magnification of Hg with altitude was observed in the surface ice. A higher concentration of Hg corresponded with the dust layer of the snow pit. It was observed that about 42% of Hg was lost from the surface snow when the glacier was exposed to sunlight within the first 24 h indicating some Hg was emitted back to the atmosphere while some were percolated downwards. The result from the principal component analysis (PCA) showed that the sources of Hg in Laohugou Glacier No. 12 were from crustal and biomass burning. Finally, it was estimated that total export of Hg from the outlet river of Laohugou glacier No. 12 in the year 2015 was about 1439.46 g yr(-1) with yield of 22.77 mu g m(2) yr(-1).

To investigate lake-mire ecosystem transformations and driving mechanisms in volcanic landform regions, the developmental history of Gushantun peatland in northeast China was reconstructed in this study. Results indicate that Gushantun peatland initiated in the deepest portions of the basin, and subsequently experienced expansions outward. Peat initiated from approximately 12kacal. BP to present. The developmental patterns of Gushantun peatland can be divided into four stages: the stable stage 1 (12-10kacal. BP), maximum stage (10-7kacal. BP), stable stage 2 (7-4kacal. BP) and stable stage 3 (4-0kacal. BP). The possible forcing mechanisms for the development of Gushantun peatland were different during different periods. From 12kacal. BP to 10kacal. BP, autogenic process was probably the major controlling factor for the expansion of this peatland. From 10 to 7kacal. BP, flat basin morphology was the major influence factor for fast expansion. However, the development of Gushantun peatland was probably controlled by the dual effects of high moisture and autogenic process during the period of 7 to 4kacal. BP. From 4kacal. BP to present, steep basin morphology was the major influence factor, while moisture might be the secondary factor for development of Gushantun peatland. These features indicate that lake-mire ecosystem transforms in volcanic landform regions of Changbai Mountains were probably triggered by the complex effects of autogenic process, hydroclimate and underlying basin morphology.

AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												This review examines the transition of coastal micro-outlets to micro-estuaries, to fully functional and species rich estuaries of various types. The definitions of the different types of microsystems are reviewed and it is apparent that an estuary is not simply a coastal water body where river and seawater meet. A range of other conditions, especially regular marine-estuarine connectivity and the persistence of a relatively large waterbody, are required for a flourishing estuarine biota to become established. In contrast to many global countries, the South African coastline has a continuum of coastal microsystems that cover the full spectrum of micro-outlets of various sizes, through micro-estuaries in the process of becoming estuarine systems, to a range of fully functional estuaries such as temporarily open/closed and predominantly open estuaries, to large estuarine lakes and bays. The impact of sea-level rise and fall on the exposure or inundation of coastal waterfalls is also examined, thus providing additional insights into the transformation of a freshwater outlet into a functional estuary. Furthermore, the creation of artificial concrete canal outlets in some of the major coastal cities is documented, with some estuaries being lost in the process.

Potamoplankton size structure and taxonomic composition:: Influence of river size and nutrient concentrations	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We measured the size structure and taxonomic composition of phytoplankton in temperate rivers during base flows of summer to investigate the influence of river size, ambient nutrient concentration, and light availability on potamoplankton community structure. Algal biomass was measured in three size classes (2-20, 20-64, and > 64 mu m) by microscope enumeration of water samples collected in 31 rivers and by chlorophyll a in water samples collected in 46 rivers in another year across Ontario and western Quebec. Nanoplankton dominated the potamoplankton biomass across the range of river nutrient concentrations (total phosphorus 5-280 mu g P L-1 water residence times (1-39 d), and light regimes (euphotic zone to mixing depth ratio 0.1-33). Both nanoplankton (2-20 mu m) and total potamoplankton biomass were significantly correlated with water column total phosphorus concentrations and were not related to water residence time or light availability. On average, diatoms contributed the largest percentage of the total biomass, followed by cryptophytes and an equal percentage of chlorophytes and chrysophytes. The contribution of any one division to total biomass was not significantly correlated with nutrients, water residence time, or light regime. In contrast to temperate lake systems, both the proportion of biomass in larger size classes and the contribution of cyanobacteria did not change significantly as a function of nutrient concentrations. However, community size structure varied in relation to river size: netplankton (> 64 mu m) contributed slightly more to total biomass at sites with both shorter (< 2 d) and longer (> 10 d) water residence times. These results point to differences between the phytoplankton of lakes and rivers in response to eutrophication.					; Pick, Frances/AAD-6379-2021; Pick, Frances/P-2473-2017; Chételat, John/AAE-4711-2020	Chetelat, John/0000-0002-9380-7203; Pick, Frances/0000-0002-5486-4061; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	2006	51	1	2				681	689		10.4319/lo.2006.51.1_part_2.0681	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2006.51.1_part_2.0681													WOS:000241296700028

Pyrite deformation and connections to gold mobility: Insight from micro-structural analysis and trace element mapping	LITHOS												The metamorphic transition of pyrite to pyrrhotite results in the liberation of lattice-bound and nano-particulate metals initially hosted within early sulphide minerals. This process forms the basis for the metamorphic-driven Au-upgrading model applied to many orogenic Au deposits, however the role of syn-metamorphic pyrite deformation in controlling the retention and release of Au and related pathfinder elements is poorly understood. The lower amphibolite facies metamorphic mineral assemblage (Act-Bt-PI-Ep-Alm +/- Cal +/- Qz +/- Ilm; 550 degrees C) of Canada's giant Detour Lake deposit falls within the range of pressure-temperature conditions (450 degrees C) for crystal plastic deformation of pyrite. We have applied a complementary approach of electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) mapping and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) 2D element mapping on pyrite from the Detour Lake deposit. Chemical element maps document an early generation of Au rich sieve textured pyrite domains and a later stage of syn-metamorphic oscillatory-zoned Au-poor pyrite. Both pyrite types are cut by Au-rich fractures as a consequence of remobilization of Au with trace element enrichment of first-row transition elements, post-transition metals, chalcogens and metalloids during a late brittle deformation stage. However, similar enrichment in trace elements and Au can be observed along low-angle grain boundaries within otherwise Au-poor pyrite, indicating that heterogeneous microstructural misorientation patterns and higher strain domains are also relatively Au-rich. We therefore propose that the close spatial relationship between pyrite and Au at the microscale, features typical of orogenic Au deposits, reflects the entrapment of Au within deformation-induced microstructures in pyrite rather than the release of Au during the metamorphic transition from pyrite to pyrrhotite. Moreover, mass balance calculations at the deposit scale suggest that only a small percentage of Au could have been sourced from pyrite and instead point to the role of substructures in pyrite as depositional traps for Au during syn-metamorphic deformation and fluid-assisted diffusion Au-upgrading.

Anthropogenic nutrient loading from urban sewage and agricultural runoff has caused eutrophication of aquatic systems. The impact of this eutrophication and consequent photosynthetic activity on CO2 exchange between freshwater systems and the atmosphere is unclear. In this study, we focused on how nutrient loading to lakes affects their carbonate system. Here, we report results of surveys of lakes in Japan at different stages of eutrophication. Alkalization due to photosynthetic activity and decreases in PCO2 had occurred in eutrophic lakes (e.g., Lake Kasumigaura), whereas in an acidotrophic lake (Lake Inawashiro) that was impacted by volcanic hot springs, nutrient loading was changing the pH and carbon cycling. When the influence of volcanic activity was stronger in the past in Lake Inawashiro, precipitation of volcanic-derived iron and aluminum had removed nutrients by co-precipitation. During the last three decades, volcanic activity has weakened and the lake water has become alkalized. We inferred that this rapid alkalization did not result just from the reduction in acid inputs but was also strongly affected by increased photosynthetic activity during this period. Human activities affect many lakes in the world. These lakes may play an important part in the global carbon cycle through their influence on CO2 exchange between freshwater and the atmosphere. Biogeochemical changes and processes in these systems have important implications for future changes in aquatic carbonate systems on land.

Douglas			Unique surface density layers promote formation of harmful algal blooms in the Pengxi River, Three Gorges Reservoir	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												The Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR), China, is the largest man-made reservoir in the world. Harmful algal blooms (HABs) have become common since the reservoir's impoundment in 2003. To investigate the mechanisms of HAB formation in the reservoir and to determine possible mitigation measures, we conducted surveys over a range of spatial scales and temporal resolutions over a 2-y period (March 2013-December 2014). The large-scale survey (the portion of the reservoir on the main stem of the Yangtze River and 22 tributaries) revealed that cyanobacteria blooms were restricted to the upper reaches of the tributaries. The medium-scale survey (1 tributary: Pengxi River) showed that cyanobacteria blooms were confined to the early-spring period with the initiation of thermal stratification in the deep-water column. The small-scale survey (a local, backwater lake in the Pengxi River), which was of higher-temporal resolution than the other 2 surveys, demonstrated that the bloom occurred at the same time as the formation of a surface-density layer unique to the geomorphology and water-control management of the reservoir. The vertical distributions of the bloom and surface-density layer appeared to be related, although the density layer persisted beyond the duration of the HABs. We hypothesized that limited nutrient diffusion into these density layers could result in nutrient limitation despite the hyper-eutrophic conditions that generally characterize the TGR basin. In the main stem of the Yangtze River and lower reaches of the tributaries in the TGR, algal blooms were not observed because of continuous, deep mixing throughout the year. We conclude that the hydrological stability and geomorphological characteristics of the TGR play critical roles in regulating the temporal and spatial patterns of algal blooms and that artificial mixing of the water column is currently the best option to limit HAB formation, especially in upper tributaries.					; Liu, Defu/L-1307-2019; Y, jianjun/JFA-0817-2023; FU, Li/AAD-4775-2019; Van Cappellen, Philippe/A-2906-2013	Xia, Zhiqiang/0000-0002-9201-1043; 													2161-9549	2161-9565				DEC 1	2020	39	4					722	734		10.1086/710332	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/710332		DEC 2020											WOS:000577955500003

Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the fine structure of this species is typical of the genus Gomphosphenia, although the striae are composed of a few areolae unlike Gomphosphenia lingulatiformis, the type species of the genus. Based on light micrographs of more than 100 specimens, the radii of the head pole, foot pole, and each valve side of these specimens were measured within a range that can be approximated by an arc, as well as the valve length, width, and stria density. The morphometric data were log-transformed and orthogonalized using principal component analysis based on the correlation coefficient, and the first principal component was eliminated to remove the effect of size differences. The second and subsequent principal components approximately followed a multivariate normal distribution. Morphometric data of the specimens from the other samples from Lake Biwa and its satellite lakes mostly fell into the 99% confident ellipsoidal cylinder, whereas those of the other Gomphosphenia species, whose striae are composed of multiple areolae, were all excluded from it. We therefore concluded that G. biwaensis is a new species of Gomphosphenia. It was an abundant epiphyte on Lyngbya wollei, a benthic filamentous cyanobacterium, which flourishes in Lake Biwa's south basin. However, L. wollei seems to not be the original host because it is probably an exotic species to Lake Biwa that has rapidly increased since 2012, while G. biwaensis was also present in samples collected there in 2000.

Treatment efficiency of a wet detention pond combined with filters of crushed concrete and sand: a Danish full-scale study of stormwater	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Traditional wet detention ponds and sand filters remove particles efficiently, whereas only a minor part of the dissolved and bioavailable load is removed. To improve the retention of dissolved substances, we tested crushed concrete as a filter material simultaneously with a traditional sand filter placed after an existing wet pond. The particulate fractions (particles, organic matter, phosphorus, and heavy metals) were removed efficiently in the pond and both filter materials, with the concrete filter often being best seen over a year. Dissolved heavy metals (lead (Pb), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), and cadmium (Cd)) were largely retained, though a washout was observed from the pond (Ni and Cu), concrete filter (Cr), and sand filter (Ni) during the first month. The pond only retained total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) during summer. Crushed concrete and sand had a high (>70 %) retention of TDP within the first months of operation, but the retention dropped in both filters due to a large oil load into the system (4 kg impermeable ha(-1) in 1 month). The poor retention might to some degree be due to mineralization processes turning particulate phosphorus (PP) into TDP. The massive oil load was retained efficiently (99.3 %) in the pond and both filters, clearly illustrating that both filter materials were able to retain either oil or TDP. An additional pilot study showed that at residence times of 1 h, crushed concrete bound 90 % TDP whereas sand only bound 22 % TDP. Retention of TDP and PP decreased with shorter residence time in both materials, but fastest in sand.

Across all sites (n = 56), sedimentary C : N was primarily related to variables reflecting allochthonous organic matter and nutrient fluxes, with 67% of the variance explained by watershed vegetation type, watershed area, mean slope, and salmon spawner densities. In a subset of sites with nutrient data (n = 41), 63% of variance in C : N was explained by precipitation and watershed vegetation type. Sediment delta N-15 was most strongly related to salmon spawner densities, but C : N and watershed area : lake area ratios explained significant residual variance (total 55%). In sites with nutrient data, salmon spawner densities, vegetation type, and spring nitrate explained 62% of the variance in delta N-15. Sediment C : N and delta N-15 values exhibited distinct interregional variation, typically varying inversely. Regional delta N-15-salmon density relationships (regression slopes) varied strongly with total annual precipitation (r(2) = 0.89, p = 0.016, n = 5), suggesting watershed organic matter and nutrient loading vary predictably in relation to regional biogeoclimatic conditions. Our findings demonstrate that paleolimnological analyses are useful for quantitative reconstruction of past salmon densities; however, inferences regarding past salmon populations must consider the factors regulating influxes of nitrogen from watershed sources.

Late Quaternary evolution of Mediterranean poljes - the Vatos case study (Akarnania, NW Greece) based on geo-scientific core analyses and IRSL dating	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR GEOMORPHOLOGIE												Sediments of the Vatos polje in the mountains of central Akarnania, NW Greece, were studied to reveal the late-Quaternary palacoenvironmental landscape evolution and to detect phases of morphodynamic activity and stability. Four vibracores, up to 9 in long, were retrieved from the lower polje grounds and were studied by means of sedimentological, geochemical, micromorphological, mineralogical and geoarchaeological methods. Radiocarbon dating, archaeological age determination of diagnostic ceramic fragments and, for the first time, IRSL dating techniques were used to establish a local geochronological frame for the polje evolution. Our results show that, between LGM and around 14 ka before present, a permanent freshwater lake existed. By the beginning of the Holocene, the lake was desiccating, probably due to a climatic change towards drier conditions. In the Neolithic epoch, morphodynamic activity strongly increased and led to the deposition of coarse-grained proximal alluvial fan sediments in the area of the former lake. This seems to be related to the strong 7 ka-increase in precipitation in the eastern Mediterranean known from many palaeoclimatological studies. After a subsequent period of ecological stability and prevailing soil formation, torrential systems in the Vatos polje were re-activated at the beginning of the 3(rd) millennium before present. Within this context, up to 2.5 in-thick alluvial deposits were accumulated until Roman times. Geoarchaeological findings of ceramic and wood fragments and charcoal indicate that human activities were responsible for this severe change of environmental conditions. Another increase in fluvial dynamics occurred in late Roman to Byzantine times when clearing of forests on the slopes of the surrounding Akarnanian mountains caused the temporary shift of proximal alluvial fan zones to the lower grounds of the polje. It is only since antiquity that the Vatos polje is characterized by a periodical freshwater take during winter seasons. The results are discussed against the background of similar studies on late Quaternary polje evolution in the wider Mediterranean area. In this context, our IRSL dating approach allows more detailed geochronological conclusions on the polje history than previous studies based on radiocarbon dating alone. This paper shows that, due to the high quality of the morphodynamic, sedimentological and palacoenvironmental data recovered, poljes represent highly valuable, so far often neglected geo-archives for the reconstruction of the landscape evolution in the Mediterranean.					; Brueckner, Helmut/O-3017-2015	Vott, Andreas/0000-0001-7001-6225; 													0372-8854					JUN	2009	53	2					145	169		10.1127/0372-8854/2009/0053-0145	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/0372-8854/2009/0053-0145													WOS:000267399100001

It is also highly endangered due to climate change and rapid tourism development in the area. Being abundant, diverse and mostly predatory, true aquatic bugs play an important role in the functioning of freshwater ecosystems and are used as indicators of aquatic habitat quality. Nevertheless, this taxonomic group has been scarcely studied in the area. Our survey provides the first comprehensive DNA barcode library for 24 out of 25 species of aquatic Heteroptera collected in the Skadar Lake basin and adjacent regions. By this, we extend the list of species known from the area by 60%. In the case of three species, Notonecta maculata, Hydrometra stagnorum and Nepa cinerea, we detected multiple highly divergent, and also new BINs indicating possible taxonomic inconsistencies, the potential for (pseudo)cryptic diversity and intricate phylogeographic patterns. We show that presumably well-known hotspots, such as Lake Skadar region, are heavily understudied regarding even the prominent insect taxa and, thus, particularly vulnerable to undocumented biodiversity loss. Finally, we underline the value of simple DNA-barcoding-based surveys for providing reference barcode libraries for effective biomonitoring and signalling taxonomic and biogeographic issues.

The limited number of precisely dated, high-resolution proxy records, however, restricts our understanding of climate dynamics through the LG. Here, we present the first annually-resolved tree-cellulose stable oxygen and carbon isotope chronology (delta O-18(tree), delta C-13(tree)) covering the LG between similar to 14 050 and 12 795 cal BP, generated from a Swiss pine trees (P. sylvestris; 27 trees, 1255 years). Comparisons of delta O-1(8)tree with regional lake and ice core delta O-18 records reveal that LG climatic changes over the North Atlantic (as recorded by Greenland Stadials and Inter-Stadials) were not all experienced to the same degree in the Swiss trees. Possible explanations include: (1) LG climate oscillations may be less extreme during the summer in Switzerland, (2) tree-ring delta O-18-may capture local precipitation and humidity changes and/or (3) decayed cellulose and various micro-site conditions may overprint large-scale temperature trends found in other delta O-18 records. Despite these challenges, our study emphasises the potential to investigate hydroclimate conditions using subfossil pine stable isotopes. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Petrology of the 1952 Eruption and Ancient Lava and Pyroclastic Flows of Krenitsyn Peak Volcano, Onekotan Island, Kuril Arc, Russia	GEOSCIENCES												Krenitsyn Peak is one of the two active volcanoes on Onekotan Island (Greater Kuril Ridge). The inaccessibility of the island, along with the volcano being situated within a sizeable (7 km in diameter) and cold (3.7 degrees C) caldera lake, has led to minimal research on the area. We present the first detailed characterization of the rocks from the only historical eruption of Krenitsyn Peak (November 1952) and a brief description of the ancient lava and pyroclastic density current (PDC) deposits that make up the building of the volcano. The 1952 eruptive products are represented by two-pyroxene andesites (59.2-63.3 wt.% SiO2), and the older lava and pyroclastic flow rocks consist of two-pyroxene andesites and dacites (62-67.6 wt.% SiO2). Almost all samples belong to the calc-alkaline, medium-K, and medium-Fe series, and the pumiceous lapilli from the 1952 eruption fall into the low-Fe series. The minerals exhibit signs of magma mingling, including relic high-Ca (up to An92) plagioclase cores with signs of dissolution and recrystallization, and oscillatory-zoned pyroxene.

The hydro- chemical facies evolution (HFE) diagram suggests that the Na-Cl facies is the dominant hydrochemical facies. Groundwater chemistry is mostly influenced by cation exchange and its interaction with silicate rocks, as shown by the Gibbs plot. The isotopic composition of delta O-18, SD, and delta S-34 varies from -3.17 parts per thousand to -1.35 parts per thousand (with an average of -1.69 parts per thousand), -25.5 parts per thousand to -9 parts per thousand VSMOW (with an average of -18.09 parts per thousand) and -7.7 parts per thousand-16.7 parts per thousand V-CDT (with an average of 0.54 parts per thousand), respectively. The salinization of groundwater may be caused by the evaporation of water or the dissolution of evaporites. This can be inferred from the delta O-18 to SD data, which indicates that a majority of water falls below the GMWL, IMWL, and LMWL. The d-excess value, ranging from -19.8 parts per thousand to 5.36 parts per thousand, further suggests that the groundwater has undergone evaporation before infiltration. In addition, the comparison between the delta S-34-SO(4)(2-)and SO42- plots suggested that the dissolution of evaporites is the primary source of SO42-. Water chemistry changes in this aquifer is primarily caused by water-rock interaction, ion exchange, and evaporation.

The plateau consists of approximately 230,000 acres (92,600 hectares) of land with saline and saline-alkali soils. The sources of water include surface and ground water. The major watershed draining to the area is Ajichai basin. Ajichai originates from Sabalan Mountain, travels approximately 168 miles (270 km), and falls through 1,887 feet (575 m) and joins the Lake Orumiyeh. Along its route, various tributaries that originate or pass through salt mines join the river and consequently make it saline for irrigation. The reclamation project consists of dealing with sources of salinity for surface water and reclamation of the saline soil in the plateau with due consideration for impact of the project on Lake Orumiyeh. The project features include construction of a series of earth dams, including an impermeable earth core rockfill dam as the main storage and flood control reservoir, water conveyance facilities, drainage systems, and soil amendments. Due to salt transport in irrigation water and its commutative effect on agricultural lands, it is believed that the complex issues of this reclamation project are good examples of the nature of challenges facing irrigation and drainage in the new millennium.																					1-887903-09-7				2000							A73	A93																WOS:000176509300041

Resilience of larval wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) to hydrocarbons and other compounds released from naturally weathered diluted bitumen in a boreal lake	AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY												The risks to aquatic wildlife from spills of diluted bitumen (dilbit) into inland waters are poorly understood. In this paper, we describe the response of larval wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) to hydrocarbons and other compounds released from experimental spills of dilbit in a temperate boreal lake. To simulate a wide range of environmentally relevant oil spill scenarios, different volumes of Cold Lake Winter Blend dilbit (0, 1.5, 2.9, 5.5, 18, 42, 82, and 180 L) were added to 10 m diameter in-lake limnocorrals. Larvae (n = 360) were reared (from Gosner Stage (GS) 25 to similar to 42) in land-based aquatic microcosms, where they were first exposed to clean water during a 2-week baseline phase, and then (at GS similar to 30), to contaminated water withdrawn from the limnocorrals for 3 weeks. We observed no statistically significant trends in survival, growth, or development of larvae as a consequence of exposure to the chemical compounds released from naturally weathered dilbit. Likewise, neither cytochrome P450 1A biomarkers nor levels of thyroid hormones in wood frogs near metamorphic climax were significantly related to volume of the oil spills. However, there was a modest statistically significant decrease in larval activity (up to 8.7% relative to the control), but no change in other behavioral metrics (i.e., sociality or space use). Our work adds to the limited body of literature on the effects of unconventional oils on aquatic wildlife and helps to inform risk assessments regarding pipeline projects.					; Rodriguez Gil, Jose Luis/B-3479-2010; Orihel, Diane/G-5462-2011; Blais, Jules/AAV-2321-2020; Langlois, Valerie/NES-9593-2025; Hanson, Mark/C-4620-2008	Denton, Daniel/0000-0002-2576-773X; Blais, Jules/0000-0002-7188-3598; Patterson, Samuel/0000-0001-9034-6803; Yang, Zeyu/0000-0001-8168-400X; Hanson, Mark/0000-0002-8725-004X; Rodriguez Gil, Jose Luis/0000-0001-9325-9131; Langlois, Valerie S./0000-0003-4031-6838; 													0166-445X	1879-1514				APR	2022	245								106128	10.1016/j.aquatox.2022.106128	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2022.106128		MAR 2022						35255276					WOS:000765534900020

Deposition and deformation of fluvial-lacustrine sediments of the Upper Triassic-Lower Jurassic Whitmore Point Member, Moenave Formation, northern Arizona	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												The stratigraphic section of the Upper Triassic-Lower Jurassic Whitmore Point Member of the Moenave Formation at Potter Canyon, Arizona, comprises c. 26 m of gray to black shales and red mudstones interbedded with mainly sheet-like siltstones and sandstones. These strata represent deposition from suspension and sheetflow processes in shallow, perennial meromictic to ephemeral lakes, and on dry mudflats of the terminal floodout of the northward-flowing Moenave stream system. The lakes were small, as indicated by the lack of shoreline features and limited evidence for deltas. Changes in base level, likely forced by climate change, drove the variations between mudflat and perennial lacustrine conditions. Lenticular sandstones that occur across the outcrop face in the same stratigraphic interval in the lower part of the sequence represent the bedload fill of channels incised into a coarsening-upward lacustrine sequence following a fall in base level. These sandstones are distinctive for the common presence of over-steepened bedding, dewatering structures, and less commonly, folding. Deformation of these sandstones is interpreted as aseismic due to the lack of features typically associated with seismicity, such as fault-graded bedding, diapirs, brecciated fabrics and clastic dikes. Rapid deposition of the sands on a fluid-rich substrate produced a reverse density gradient that destabilized, and potentially fluidized the underlying, finer-grained sediments. This destabilization allowed synsedimentary subsidence of most of the channel sands, accompanied by longitudinal rotation and/or ductile deformation of the sand bodies. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

J	Guest, B; Pavlis, TL; Golding, H; Serpa, L				Guest, B; Pavlis, TL; Golding, H; Serpa, L			Chasing the Garlock: A study of tectonic response to vertical axis rotation	GEOLOGY												Vertical-axis, clockwise block rotations in the Northeast Mojave block are well documented by numerous authors. However, the effects of these rotations on the crust to the north of the Northeast Mojave block have remained unexplored. In this paper we present a model that results from mapping and geochronology conducted in the north and central Owlshead Mountains. The model suggests that some or all of the transtension and rotation observed in the Owlshead Mountains results from tectonic response to a combination of clockwise block rotation in the Northeast Mojave block and Basin and Range extension. The Owlshead Mountains are effectively an accommodation zone that buffers differential extension between the Northeast Mojave block and the Basin and Range. In addition, our model explores the complex interactions that occur between faults and fault blocks at the junction of the Garlock, Brown Mountain, and Owl Lake faults. We hypothesize that the bending of the Garlock fault by rotation of the Northeast Mojave block resulted in a misorientation of the Garlock that forced the Owl Lake fault to break in order to accommodate slip on the western Garlock fault. Subsequent sinistral slip on the Owl Lake fault offset the Garlock, creating the now possibly inactive Mule Springs strand of the Garlock fault. Dextral slip on the Brown Mountain fault then locked the Owl Lake fault, forcing the active Leach Lake strand of the Garlock fault to break.

Total base cations increased from 90 to 140 mu equiv/L over the pH range of the experiment (6.1-4.7). The order of increase was Ca-2 >> Mg-2+ > K+ > Na+. Loss of exchangeable cations from the upper few centimeters of sediment by H+-cation exchange can account for the increase in water-column cations, and evidence indicates that the surficial sediments became acidified. The necessary reversal of this effect will probably slow the recovery of water-column alkalinity. Several reactor-based models that describe internal alkalinity-generation processes are presented to predict rates of alkalinity recovery in the water column. Major impacts on lake nutrient chemistry were not observed to pH 4.7, but small differences were found between treatment and reference basins of the lake for summer epilimnetic averages of silica and inorganic nitrogen at pH 4.7. Total N was lower in the treatment at pH 5.1 and 4.7. N-2-fixation was inhibited in the treatment basin at pH 4.7 but, in contrast to observations on other acidified lakes, under-ice nitrification was not inhibited.

Akagi following the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant accident	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Understanding ecosystemdynamics of radionuclides is necessary to ensure effectivemanagement for food safety. The Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) accident on March 11, 2011 released large amounts of radiocesium (Cs-134 and Cs-137) and contaminated the environment across eastern Japan. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the temporal dynamics of Cs-137 in the aquatic ecosystemof Lake Onuma on Mt. Akagi. The effective ecological half-life (Teff) of Cs-137 in fishes, western waterweed (Elodea nuttallii), seston (phytoplankton and zooplankton), and lake water was estimated using survey data of Cs-137 concentration collected from 2011 to 2016, and single- and two-component decay function models (SDM and TDM, respectively). The decay processes of Cs-137 concentrations in wakasagi (Hypomesus nipponensis), pale chub (Zacco platypus), phytoplankton, and total Cs-137 concentrations of thewater column(WC) in the lakewerewell suited by the TDMs. The Teff in the fast component of the TDMs in these samples ranged from 0.49 to 0.74 years. The Teff in the slow component of the TDMs could converge towards the physical half-life of Cs-137. Nearly five and a half years after the FDNPP accident, we concluded that Cs-137 concentrations approached a state of dynamic equilibriumbetween some aquatic organisms (wakasagi, pale chub, and phytoplankton) and the environment (lake water). However, the decay processes of Cs-137 concentrations in Japanese dace (Tribolodon hakonensis), western waterweed, zooplankton, and particulate- and dissolved-forms in the WC were better predicted for the SDM. The total Cs-137 concentrations in inflowing river and spring waters were one to two orders of magnitude lower than lake water under normal flow conditions. However, particulate Cs-137 contamination level in the river water was high after heavy rains. Overall, Cs-137 contamination levels have significantly decreased in Lake Onuma, but monitoring surveys should be continued for further understanding of the reduction processes.

Despite abundant lithium resources, volatile market fluctuations underscore the critical need for the accurate monitoring of production capacity. Brine-type lithium resources, accounting for approximately 65% of the global reserves, are concentrated in the "lithium triangle" region of South America (Chile, Argentina, and Bolivia). This region typically employs solar evaporation ponds to extract lithium from brine, where lithium production directly correlates with the pond area, enabling remote sensing-based capacity monitoring. This study focuses on Chile's Atacama Salt Lake, utilizing long-term Landsat and Sentinel satellite data (1985-2019) to extract evaporation pond areas through visual interpretation and support vector machine (SVM) classification. We further investigated the relationship between salt pond area and lithium production capacity by establishing a linear conversion formula. The results demonstrated a strong correlation (R2 = 0.91), with over 97% of the data points falling within the 95% prediction band, validating the effectiveness of the method. This study proposes a semi-automated monitoring framework for lithium production capacity in salt lake brine systems, offering novel insights for sustainable lithium resource management and supporting the stable development of energy transition.

J	GOLDMAN, CR				GOLDMAN, CR			PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY, NUTRIENTS, AND TRANSPARENCY DURING THE EARLY ONSET OF EUTROPHICATION IN ULTRA-OLIGOTROPHIC LAKE TAHOE, CALIFORNIA NEVADA	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												For more than half a century, the trophic status of water bodies has been of interest to limnologists and oceanographers alike. This report demonstrates the close, inverse relationship between 14C-estimated primary productivity and transparency during the earliest stages of cultural eutrophication. As the population in the Tahoe basin has rapidly increased, Lake Tahoe has been characterized by an increase in primary productivity that has averaged 5.6% yr-1 for the last 28 yr. There has been a concomitant decline in transparency of 0.37 m yr-1. During winter months when transparency is highest, the average annual loss has been slightly greater (0.40 m yr-1). The average annual Secchi depth has decreased by 7 m during the last 19 yr of intensive monitoring. There has also been a significant increase in the light extinction coefficient. Photosynthetic efficiency has increased while there has been a gradual shrinkage of the euphotic zone. During the same period the total NO3--N content of the lake has increased significantly, but total P content has not. Lake Tahoe primary production has become increasingly P sensitive during the last decade as N has accumulated in the system. A gradual increase in the N:P may prove to be a general evolutionary characteristic of oligotrophic lakes during the earliest stages of eutrophication. The importance of long-term studies in detecting gradual change that may be masked by considerable interannual variability is particularly evident from this study.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	1988	33	6	1				1321	1333		10.4319/lo.1988.33.6.1321	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1988.33.6.1321													WOS:A1988T062500010

Filling in the Flyover Zone: High Phosphorus in Midwestern (USA) Reservoirs Results in High Phytoplankton Biomass but Not High Primary Productivity	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												In lakes and reservoirs, climate change increases surface water temperatures, promotes thermal stability, and decreases hypolimnetic oxygen. Increased anthropogenic land-use and precipitation enhance nutrient and sediment supply. Together, these effects alter the light and nutrient dynamics constraining phytoplankton biomass and productivity. Given that lake and reservoir processes differ, and that globally, reservoir numbers are increasing to meet water demands, reservoir-centric studies remain underrepresented. In the agricultural Midwest (United States), ubiquitous reservoirs experience eutrophy and hypolimnetic anoxia. Here, we explore influences of eutrophication and land-use on the proximate light and nutrient status of phytoplankton communities in 32 Missouri reservoirs. Light and nutrient status indicators include mixed layer irradiance, phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) stoichiometry/debts, photosynthetic efficiency, and photosynthetic-irradiance parameters. Contributing to the ongoing P vs. N and P management debate, we evaluate if phytoplankton biomass and productivity are constrained by light, P, N, or a combination thereof, across gradients of trophic status and land-use during two contrasting wet and dry summers. Despite agricultural prevalence, P-deficiency is more prominent than either N- or light-deficiency. In 2018, similar to 46% of samples were P-deficient with similar to 36% indicating neither light nor nutrient deficiency. Gross primary productivity per unit chlorophyll-a (GPP(B)) demonstrates negative relationships with nutrients, biomass, and turbidity, and positive relationships with light availability. GPP(B) is highest in oligotrophic reservoirs where light utilization efficiency is also highest. Overall, phytoplankton biomass and productivity appear constrained by P and light, respectively. If Midwestern reservoirs are precursors of future inland waters affected by climate change and eutrophication, our crystal ball indicates that both P and light will be important regulators of phytoplankton dynamics and subsequent water quality.																				2296-665X				JUL 30	2020	8								111	10.3389/fenvs.2020.00111	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2020.00111													WOS:000561524600001
J	Luo, WG; Zhang, JT; Wang, M; Zhao, JX				Luo, Wenguang; Zhang, Jiantao; Wang, Mian; Zhao, Jinxiao			Towards More Accurate Risk Assessment of Sediment Trace Metals: Integrating Sedimentary Background Determination and Probabilistic Evaluation in Chaohu Lake, China	WATER												Accurate ecological risk assessment of trace metals in lake sediments remains a significant challenge due to the widespread use of generalized regional background values, which often fail to capture the spatial and historical heterogeneity of sedimentary environments. This study addresses this gap by establishing sediment-specific background values of heavy metals through high-resolution core sampling from three representative zones (western, central, and eastern) of Chaohu Lake, China. The determined variation depths (36.60 cm, 21.35 cm, and 47.58 cm) allowed for the reconstruction of pre-contamination baselines for key trace metals. These refined background values were then incorporated into enhanced ecological risk assessment frameworks, including the geo-accumulation index (Igeo) and a modified potential ecological risk index (RI), which integrates chemical accumulation with toxicity units (& sum;TU). A probabilistic risk assessment based on the refined RI was further conducted using a large sediment dataset. The results revealed that 67.0% of the samples posed low ecological risk, while 33.0% fell into the moderate-risk category, with mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), and nickel (Ni) identified as the primary contributors. This study demonstrates that sediment-specific background values, when combined with probabilistic risk modeling, offer a more accurate, site-relevant, and scientifically grounded approach for assessing and managing trace metal contamination in lake systems.																				2073-4441				MAY 4	2025	17	9							1383	10.3390/w17091383	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w17091383													WOS:001486089900001
J	del Río, JL; Malvárez, G; Navas, F				Luis del Rio, Jose; Malvarez, Gonzalo; Navas, Fatima			Reservoir Lake Effects on Eroded Littoral Systems: The Case of the Bay of Marbella, Southern Spain	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												The Bay of Marbella, in Western Costa del Sol (southern Spain), is one of the most artificialized coastal areas of the Mediterranean. Environmental factors, such as geology and climatic conditions, have supported a great variety of industrial activities over time. However, tourism industry positioned Marbella as an internationally renowned destination demanding the rapid artificialisation of its hinterland between the 1970s and the 1990s, relying such process on natural resources -mainly water- for urban sprawl. Small reservoir lakes were constructed in the 19th century for iron melting and irrigation industries, but the greatest water management infrastructure for the development of the tourism industry, La Concepcion Dam, was constructed in the 1970s in the lower reaches of the Rio Verde, the main river in the area. Although a significant amount of water is stored in the dam, the presence of steep slopes and the likely occurrence of heavy rainfall during winter generate torrential water runoff with high energy and high rates of sediment yield. The dam performs as a sediment trap and has induced the annulment of the main source of sediment supply to the littoral system, inducing severe coastal erosion processes which have not been successfully tackled yet. This paper presents a first order estimate of sediment yield in the Rio Verde watershed introducing sediment budget stored within La Concepcion reservoir. Results show that potential high sediment yield rates estimated in the Rio Verde watershed might have reached La Concepcion Dam and might have contributed to the siltation of the reservoir lake and direct coastal erosion. Whilst recognised as the main culprit, no action is undertaken by the decision-makers to extract and reutilise sediments silting coastal dams.

Great uncertainties exist regarding the spatiotemporal variations of CO2 concentrations and emission rates in stream-lake fluvial networks and small streams with variable plant cover. We studied this variability and the underlying mechanisms in 40 small, high-alkalinity Danish streams, including 5 catchments with lakes. Generally CO2 concentrations were, on average, 9.2 times those of the atmosphere, declining downstream with rising water temperature, chlorophyll a concentration, and decreasing groundwater inputs. We furthermore observed that the concentrations of CO2 in stream waters declined at the outlet of lakes to values close to or below air saturation due to phytoplankton uptake and atmospheric loss during the long water retention time in the lakes. Downstream, CO2 concentrations were observed to decrease in summer and in the afternoons, which indicate plant uptake of CO2. Sites with deeper water and few plants and low gas transfer velocity retained high CO2 concentrations. Among 38 fluvial networks where emission could be calculated, it varied 10-fold (0.41-4.06 g C m(-2) d(-1)), but the overall mean was constrained to a narrow confidence interval (1.75-2.50 g C m(-2) d(-1)). Our results highlight that a complex of physical, chemical and biological processes cause highly variable carbon dynamics and CO2 emissions in fluvial networks at local and catchment scales making upscaling challenging.					; Riis, Tenna/AAE-4115-2020	Riis, Tenna/0000-0003-2501-4444; Kjaer, Johan Emil/0000-0002-4315-0258														2333-5084				DEC	2022	9	12							e2022EA002664	10.1029/2022EA002664	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022EA002664													WOS:000925727800001

In the early 1960s, Nanticoke Hamlet, located on the northern shore of Lake Erie [Canada], was selected for a large industrial development program. The 1st phase saw the commissioning of a 4000 MW Ontario Hydro thermal generating station, a 100,000 barrels/day Texaco refinery and a Stelco steel plant with an initial annual capacity of 1.7 .times. 106 tons. Favorable climatological data was 1 criterion used for selecting this site. Extensive monitoring of ambient air and water quality was out prior to the construction phase of the program. Post operation monitoring was also done on a continuous basis. The data collected indicated that the impact of the industrial activity on air quality in the Haldimand-Norfolk region had been small, with < 20 exceedances/yr of the hourly air quality criterion for SO2 (250 ppb) being observed across the network, and total suspended particulates being similar to other rural locations in Ontario. Only O3 had a substantial number of exceedances of the criterion (80 ppb hourly average) during the summer months, primarily due to long-range transport into the area from across Lake Erie.																			0049-6979	1573-2932					1985	25	3					249	264																WOS:A1985ALD6300003

Archaeological and environmental cave records in the Gobi-Altai Mountains, Mongolia	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Though hundreds of caves are known across Mongolia, few have been subject to systematic, interdisciplinary archaeological surveys and excavations to understand Late Pleistocene and Holocene environments. Previous cave excavations in Mongolia have demonstrated their potential for preservation of archaeological and biological material, including Palaeolithic assemblages and Holocene archaeology, particularly burials, with associated organic finds. In other cases, cave surveys found that stratigraphic deposits and archaeological materials are absent. The large number of caves makes the Mongolian Altai Mountain Range a potentially attractive region for human occupation in the Pleistocene and Holocene. Here we present the results of an interdisciplinary survey of caves in four carbonate areas across the Gobi-Altai Mountains. We report 24 new caves, some of which contain archaeological material recovered through survey and test excavations. Most caves presented limited sedimentation, and some were likely too small for human habitation. Six caves showed evidence of palaeontological remains, most likely from the Late Holocene and recent periods. The most notable anthropogenic findings included petroglyphs at Gazar Agui 1 & 13. Gazar Agui 1 also contained lithics and a bronze fragment. Tsakhiryn Agui 1 contained 31 wooden fragments that include an unused fire drilling tool kit and items commonly found in association with medieval burials. We observed that the caves remain in contemporary use for religious and economic purposes, such as the construction of shrines, mining and animal corralling. Water samples from the caves, and nearby rivers, lakes, and springs were analysed for their isotopic compositions (818O, 8D, 817O, 17Oexcess, d-excess) and the data, combined with backward trajectory modelling revealed that the Gobi-Altai					; Sánchez Martínez, Javier/Z-4580-2019; Breitenbach, Sebastian/AAB-1420-2019; Louys, Julien/GLN-6714-2022; Gazquez, Fernando/L-2483-2014; Kononov, Aleksandr/K-1614-2015; Petraglia, Michael/ABA-9748-2021; BOIVIN, NICOLE/OIU-2713-2025; Burguet-Coca, Aitor/ABE-4298-2020; Picin, Andrea/R-1288-2016	Petraglia, Michael/0000-0003-2522-5727; BOIVIN, NICOLE/0000-0002-7783-4199; Kononov, Aleksandr/0000-0003-2379-4782; Breitenbach, Sebastian/0000-0001-9615-2065; Sanchez-Martinez, Javier/0000-0001-8819-4177; Vanwezer, Nils/0000-0002-2330-0204; Cueva-Temprana, Arturo/0000-0002-2753-8949; Burguet-Coca, Aitor/0000-0002-1866-816X; Picin, Andrea/0000-0002-8831-8325													1040-6182	1873-4553				JUN 10	2021	586						66	89		10.1016/j.quaint.2021.03.010	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2021.03.010		APR 2021											WOS:000637334200002

Reintroduction of threespine stickleback into Cheney and Scout Lakes, Alaska	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH					8th International Conference on Stickleback Bahaviour and Evolution	JUL 26-31, 2015	Stony Brook Univ, Stony Brook, NY		Stony Brook Univ			Background: Marine or anadromous threespine stickleback have colonized many northern Holarctic lakes after glacial recession, and their freshwater descendants have diverged in characteristic ways. Such divergence begins within a few generations, but previous studies have sampled only one generation or initiated sampling several generations after the populations were founded. Rotenone treatment of two Cook Inlet lakes to exterminate invasive northern pike also eliminated native threespine stickleback, creating an opportunity to introduce anadromous stickleback and observe their adaptation to freshwater conditions for multiple generations, beginning immediately after we founded the populations. Methods: In 2009 and 2011, we released about 3000 reproductively mature anadromous threespine stickleback into each lake. We sampled the source population and made annual samples from the two introduced populations. These samples have been preserved for future analysis. We estimated annual variation in relative abundance, made preliminary morphological observations, and assessed parasite diversity. Results: Anadromous stickleback released into the lakes produced abundant progeny, many of which survived and became reproductively mature the following spring. Both populations experienced demographic bottlenecks in 2013 and 2014 and began to recover in 2015. Preliminary observations indicate that stickleback in both lakes resemble anadromous stickleback, but by 2015 about 20% of the specimens in one population had a highly heritable, freshwater phenotype. One lake population had roughly twice as many parasite species and a much higher prevalence of a large metazoan parasite than either the anadromous ancestor or the other lake population. Our preliminary observations indicate that substantial evolution occurred during the first few generations, our existing samples can be used to study contemporary evolution, and sampling should be continued.

Biomonitoring techniques that use environmental DNA (eDNA) to detect and monitor biodiversity are well established in lake, riverine, and marine ecosystems. However, their use in wetlands requires further development due to the presence of sediments that block eDNA filters to limit water filtration, alongside a lack of standardized methodology. In this study, we examined eDNA dynamics to understand spatiotemporal biodiversity patterns in an Aotearoa New Zealand wetland and to optimize their application to wetland-specific challenges. We sampled four sites across Opuatia Wetland at three time points during an austral spring. We conducted conventional taxonomic surveys, tested three different filter sizes (1.2 mu m, 5 mu m, and semi-quantitative dacron filters), and assessed our ability to detect foreign DNA (from kea; Nestor notabilis) at different time points and distances post-release. We found significant differences in DNA sequence composition across time and space, and when using different sized filters. eDNA data generally complemented (versus replaced) conventional survey and identification methods, with certain species only detected by one method or the other. Taxonomic resolution of conventional sampling and identification methods often exceeded that of eDNA. Foreign DNA was detectable 10 m from its release point for up to 1 week post-release. Our results provide new considerations for future eDNA research in wetland environments, where rapid biomonitoring techniques are needed to support conservation and preservation. Wetlands are ecologically and culturally significant ecosystems that are experiencing biodiversity declines globally. Biomonitoring techniques that use environmental DNA (eDNA) are poorly developed for wetlands. We examined eDNA dynamics at Opuatia Wetland (Aotearoa New Zealand) to identify spatial and temporal variation and highlight sampling practices that will optimize eDNA detection methods in wetland environments.image					McGaughran, Angela/C-5916-2014; Duggan, Ian/G-2275-2012	McGaughran, Angela/0000-0002-3429-8699; Bird, Starsha/0009-0006-3510-9964; Smith, Joshua Peter/0000-0002-8343-0537; 													2637-4943					MAY	2024	6	3							e574	10.1002/edn3.574	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/edn3.574													WOS:001302760400004

Large Fractionation in Iron Isotopes Implicates Metabolic Pathways for Iron Cycling in Boreal Shield Lakes	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Stable Fe isotopes have only recently been measured in freshwater systems, mainly in meromictic lakes. Here we report the (556Fe of dissolved, particulate, and sediment Fe in two small dimictic boreal shield headwater lakes: manipulated eutrophic Lake 227, with annual cyanobacterial blooms, and unmanipulated oligotrophic Lake 442. Within the lakes, the range in (556Fe is large (ca. -0.9 to +1.8%o), spanning more than half the entire range of natural Earth surface samples. Two layers in the water column with distinctive (556Fe of dissolved (dis) and particulate (spm) Fe were observed, despite differences in trophic states. In the epilimnia of both lakes, a large Delta 56Fedis-spm fractionation of 0.4-1%o between dissolved and particulate Fe was only observed during cyanobacterial blooms in Lake 227, possibly regulated by selective biological uptake of isotopically light Fe by cyanobacteria. In the anoxic layers in both lakes, upward flux from sediments dominates the dissolved Fe pool with an apparent Delta 56Fedis-spm fractionation of -2.2 to -0.6%o. Large Delta 56Fedis-spm and previously published metagenome sequence data suggest active Fe cycling processes in anoxic layers, such as microaerophilic Fe(II) oxidation or photoferrotrophy, could regulate biogeochemical cycling. Large fractionation of stable Fe isotopes in these lakes provides a potential tool to probe Fe cycling and the acquisition of Fe by cyanobacteria, with relevance for understanding biogeochemical cycling of Earth's early ferruginous oceans.

J.; Thomas, Zoe			Climate reconstruction from paired oxygen-isotope analyses of chironomid larval head capsules and endogenic carbonate (Hawes Water, UK) - Potential and problems	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Temperature and the oxygen isotopic composition (delta O-18) of meteoric water are both important palaeoclimatic variables, but separating their influences on proxies such as the delta O-18 of lake carbonates is often problematic. The large temperature variations that are known to have occurred in the northern mid-latitudes during the Late Glacial make this interval an excellent test for a novel approach that combines oxygen-isotope analyses of chironomid larval head capsules with co-occurring endogenic carbonate. We apply this approach to a Late Glacial lake sediment sequence from Hawes Water (NW England). Oxygen-isotope values in chironomid head capsules show marked variations during the Late Glacial that are similar to the oxygen isotope record from endogenic carbonate. However, summer temperature reconstructions based on the paired isotope values and fractionation between chironomids and calcite yield values between -20 and -4 degrees C, which are unrealistic and far lower than reconstructions based on chironomid assemblages at the same site. The composition of a limited number of samples of fossil chironomid larval head capsules determined using Pyrolysis gas-chromatography mass spectrometry indicates the presence of aliphatic geopolymers, suggesting that diagenetic alteration of the head capsules has systematically biased the isotope-derived temperature estimates. However, a similar trend in the isotope records of the two sources suggests that a palaeoclimate signal is still preserved. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

(IT ISSN 0391-9839, 2011). Glacial features were described for the first time on the Galicia Mountains, a mountain range separating the lakes of Ohrid and Prespa in Macedonia. The geomorphological mapping of part of this range allowed to document the existence of frontal and lateral moraines, as well as trimlines, cirques and polished rocks. These glacial features allowed the reconstruction of the original topography of the glaciers that deposited the frontal moraines. The Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA) of three different phases of expansion was calculated (ca. 1850 m, ca. 2000 m and 2130 m a.s.l.) through the Area-Altitude Balance Ratio (AABR) method, and correlated with the values available for the Balkan region and northern Greece. An attribution to Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and Lateglacial (Oldest and Younger Dryas) was argued for the glacial phases of Galicica Mountains, in agreement with the ELAs of dated moraines in the region, as well as in the Apennines and Maritime Alps. Through the extrapolation of summer temperatures at the ELAs for the single glacial phases, the amount of precipitation needed to sustain the glaciers existence was calculated (3500-3700 mm of W-eq) using a well established polynomial regression. The attribution to the LGM of the lowermost frontal moraine points out to an older age for the till found well below the examined area, near the Prespa Lake shore. This indicates that a more extended glaciation phase occurred during the Middle Pleistocene.

As a result of unexpectedly low mortality in the placebo group, there was a substantial imbalance in mortality during the course of this study (8 patients on benazepril vs. 1 on placebo). The aim of the extension study was to follow-up the patients from the AIPRI core study until autumn 1996, focusing on CRI progression and mortality. Data collection was post hoc. Patients were treated according to investigators' usual practices, without knowledge of the core study trial medication or (initially) the core trial results. A new primary efficacy parameter was defined as the time from the start of core study treatment to the occurrence of the first event in the combined composite end-point of dialysis, renal transplantation or death related to renal disease. Serial serum creatinine levels and all-cause mortality were also recorded. The median total follow-up for core + extension periods was 6.6 years. Many patients from both treatment groups (64% on benazepril and 61% on placebo) received ACE inhibitors during follow-up. In the intention-to-treat analysis of the core + extension data, only 79 of 300 patients from the benazepril group, compared to 102 of the 283 patients from the placebo group needed dialysis or renal transplantation, or died related to renal disease (P < 0.013, log-rank test). The mortality imbalance seen in the core trial was not evident with the longer follow-up (25 deaths in the benazepril and 23 in the placebo group, before dialysis). These data clearly demonstrate a long-term beneficial effect in patients randomized to lake benazepril during the core study, but because treatment during the extension period was not randomized, the results of this intention-to-treat analysis need to be interpreted with care.					; Locatelli, Franco/K-6734-2016; Mann, Johannes/AAI-8803-2020	safarikia, samira/0000-0002-7254-0634; Locatelli, Francesco/0009-0001-1630-7950													0085-2538					DEC	1997				63			S63	S66																WOS:A1997YJ60500016
J	Tipping, E; Chaplow, JS				Tipping, Edward; Chaplow, Jacky S.			Atmospheric pollution histories of three Cumbrian surface waters	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The CHemistry of the Uplands Model (CHUM), driven by measured and estimated atmospheric deposition, was used to simulate the chemical compositions of three upland Lake District surface waters: Devoke Water (DW), Levers Water (LW) and Mosedale Beck (MB) over several hundred years. 2. 'Natural acidification' combined with human activities, notably forest clearance, was assumed to have brought about chemically stable acid moorlands by the period 1000-1500 AD. Deposition of sulphur, nitrogen, chlorine and heavy metals, released into the atmosphere by coal-burning and industrial processes, then took place, gradually increasing tomaximumlevels in the late 20th century. 3. Surface water concentrations of chloride are consistent with depositional inputs, whereas the transfer of atmospherically deposited sulphur to the surface waters is delayed by temporary retention processes within the catchment. Over the last 40 years, concentrations of pollutant (nonmarine) sulphate in the surface waters declined to one-third of their maximum levels. Atmospherically deposited pollutant N continues to accumulate in catchment soils, although a significant fraction appears in surface waters as nitrate. Annual average surface water bicarbonate concentrations were 20-60 lM in the pristine past, fell nearly to zero in all three waters when acidification was most intense, but now are increasing. 4. Combined data from several Lake District upland waters suggest substantial recent increases in the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). If this can be attributed to acidification reversal, a corresponding decline in DOC concentrations would have occurred as acidification intensified, and pristine surface waters would have been comparatively rich in DOC. 5. Major cationic elements enter the soil-water system in deposition (H +, Na, Mg, K and Ca), from organic matter decomposition (H +) or by chemical weathering (Mg, Al, Ca) and are much affected by sorption to soil organic matter (SOM). The surface soils of all three catchments are acid (current pH 4.5) and so variations in surface water chemistry among sites reflect differences in mineral dissolution rates deeper in the soil-rock profile. The simulations indicate pH values of 6.9, 6.1 and 6.4 for DW, LW and MB, respectively, in the period up to 1800, followed by declines to minima of c. 6.0, 4.7 and 5.0 in around 1980, then acidification reversal in agreement with observations. 6. The transfer of atmospherically deposited heavy metals to surface waters depends upon their sorption by SOM. Nickel, zinc and cadmium adsorb relatively weakly and therefore are quite readily leached and sensitive to changes in acidification status. The higher affinities of organic matter to Cu and Pb promote retention, and these two metals are continuing to accumulate in soil, despite major declines in deposition over the past several decades. 7. The WHAM-FTOX model was used to estimate the maximum number of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera species in MB through time, as influenced by chemical variability. The maximum number is estimated to have fallen from 14 to 15 under pristine conditions to 9-10 when acidification was greatest and a modest recovery to 10-11 species since then.					; Tipping, Edward/I-6309-2012; Chaplow, Jacky/KPA-8837-2024	Chaplow, Jacky/0000-0002-8058-8697; 													0046-5070					FEB	2012	57	2					244	259		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2011.02617.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2011.02617.x													WOS:000298786200002

Detailed knowledge about past vegetation and disturbance regimes therefore forms an important basis for appropriate management. In the Bavarian Forest National Park in SE Germany, we therefore studied fossil pollen, spores and macrofossils from lake Rachelsee, a nearby mire, and Stangenfilz mire, all lying at higher elevations. Results indicate that deciduous forest on lower slopes (ca. 500-1,000 m a.s.l.) were first affected by humans in Neolithic times ca. 4500 bc with marked declines of Tilia, Ulmus and Fraxinus. High-montane mixed forests (1,000-1,450 m a.s.l.) were in a near-natural state consisting of Picea, Abies and Fagus in comparable proportions up to ca. 500 bc (a natural baseline condition), after which they were impacted by forest grazing and/or logging, starting between early-Roman times to early-Medieval times depending on location. Abies especially declined markedly. Forest partially recovered during the migration period fifth-eighth century ad, especially Carpinus, but not Abies. Subsequently, deforestation increased at lower elevation for food production, and forest grazing and wood extraction at higher elevation led to a further strong decline of Abies around ad 1000 near Rachelsee. After that, nutrient levels increased continually at all elevations, and a forest fire occurred in the 13th century near Stangenfilz. During the 19th century, forests around Rachelsee recovered partially whereas overgrazing of Stangenfilz resulted in a hiatus. Forests declined further in the 20th century around the study sites, but after ca. ad 1960 less so around Rachelsee thanks to local conservation measures. Historically recorded large-scale bark-beetle infestations following heavy storms, such as in the ad 1870s and 1980s, hardly left traces in the pollen data. From a palaeoecological perspective the Park's no-intervention management strategy is well-suited to facilitate recovery of original forest functioning and diversity, as it is slowly leading to renewal of natural mixed forest of Abies, Picea and Fagus. This development may have considerable influence on the future disturbance regime, and the insights obtained will be important for the park management.

Aims: To determine the effects of changes in nutrient status of a formerly highly-eutrophicated deep-water lake and other environmental parameters on a Great Crested Grebe population during a phase of re-oligotrophication. Methods: Annual surveys were carried out on a natural lake in Switzerland over a period of 25 years to determine breeding population size and reproductive success. The effects of phosphorus content, other limnological parameters and weather variables were analysed with quasi-Poisson models. Results: The breeding population increased from 80 pairs in 1992 to 417 pairs in 2001, after which numbers showed strong fluctuations. Total phosphorus content in the lake had a strong negative effect on breeding population size. A significant positive correlation was found with the national population index. Reproductive success fluctuated strongly but showed an overall decline. The model indicated positive effects on reproductive success of phosphorus and negative effects of the number of days with strong wind. Rapid water-level increases in early summer and water transparency in June led to higher proportions of late broods. Conclusion: Phosphorus concentration was identified as the main driver affecting the breeding population of Great Crested Grebes during the phase of recovery of the lake from a highly-eutrophic state. Results indicate that mesotrophic to eutrophic conditions enabled a large population and high breeding success. Reproductive output was further negatively affected by strong wind during a critical breeding phase.

J	Speranskaya, NA; Fuksova, TV				Speranskaya, N. A.; Fuksova, T. V.			Long-term Changes in the Main Components of Lake Khanka Water Regime	RUSSIAN METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY												Changes in annual total precipitation and annual pan evaporation for the Lake Khanka water area during the period of 1949-2015 are analyzed based on observational data of weather stations within the lake basin. The reliability of the calculated values of characteristics affecting evaporation changes was confirmed by their comparison with observations at the 20-m(2) evaporation pan installed at Astrakhanka lake station. It is shown that against a background of significant interannual fluctuations of annual precipitation during the whole period under study, its trends are almost absent. However, a rather stable increase in annual precipitation value caused by the summer precipitation rise has been noted since the early 2000s. The value of annual pan evaporation decreased from 1949 to 2015, and the rate of its decrease till 1980 was higher than in the next period. Moreover, some evaporation increase has been observed in the recent decade. The main contribution to the evaporation change is made by wind speed changes which cause about 50% of evaporation variance. Air humidity deficit is the second affecting factor that determines a little over 20% of annual evaporation variance. It is demonstrated that the increase in annual precipitation is possible by the middle of the 21st century, while the change in annual evaporation from the Lake Khanka water area would be minimal. Under such changes in the main components of the lake water regime, no reduction of its level due to natural climate processes should be expected.																			1068-3739	1934-8096				AUG	2018	43	8					530	538		10.3103/S1068373918080058	http://dx.doi.org/10.3103/S1068373918080058													WOS:000444767300005

KAPLAN	GEOCHEMICAL SOCIETY SPECIAL PUBLICATIONS				Annual Meeting of the Geological-Society-of-America	OCT 27-30, 2002	Denver, CO	Geol Soc Amer				The Dead Sea area has been associated with bitumen (=asphalt) for thousands of years. For this reason, it has commonly been taken for granted that pits of bitumen existed in the Dead Sea area, and into which the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fell after losing a battle in the vale of Siddim in the Dead Sea region (Genesis, 14: 10). However, physical evidence for the existence of such pits is practically non-existent. At times when the Dead Sea water level is low, as it is nowadays, large expanses of black mud covered with a carbonate crust are exposed along the coast of the lake. The black mud resembles asphalt in its shiny black color and sulfurous smell. It has been sometimes assumed that the mud contains asphalt, although this is not the case, and the color and smell are due to poorly crystallized iron sulfides. The solid looking carbonate veneer is quite frail and it is easy to sink through it into the underlying black mud. Thus, the biblical description may be of the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fleeing through the mud flats when the lake level was low, and sinking into the black sulfurous mud.																					0-444-51647-6				2004		9					359	364																WOS:000224951800023

BP) from Northeast China. High-resolution pollen analyses have enabled the vegetational and climatic changes of the last glacial-interglacial transition to be reconstructed in more detail than has been previously possible. Moreover, a reliable chronology has been provided by both varve counting and 40 calibrated AMS C-14 age determinations. Palaeobotanical evidence indicates predominantly steppe and open taiga-like woodland communities, with abundant Betula, Larix, Alnus fruticoso, Artemisia. grasses and sedges, which are typical of cold and dry conditions between 16,700 and 14,450 cal yrs. BR The beginning expansion of Ulmus and Fraxinus marks the onset of the Late-glacial climatic amelioration at 14,450 cal yrs. BP. Dense deciduous forests, predominantly consisting of thermophilous broadleaf taxa, become established and widespread during the Early Holocene. Two short-term climatic reversals to colder and/or dryer conditions are recorded in the proxy data between 13,900 and 13,800 cal yrs. BP and 13,100 and 12,900 cal yrs. BP, correlating with the Oldest Dryas/Greenland Interstadial (GI) 1d event and the Gerzensee/Killamey/GI-1b oscillation, respectively. The prominent reappearance of Picea and Larix, coupled with a marked decrease in broadleaved trees, prior to the start of the Holocene, implies a climatic reversal compatible with the Younger Dryas event in the circum-Atlantic region. The evident synchroneity of climate changes in the North Atlantic region and East Asia supports the theory of strong atmospheric coupling between both regions. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

To complement daytime investigations to monitor 0+ fish populations in floodplain ecosystems of the River Danube (Slovakia), we carried out a preliminary study of patterns in fish density, fish dispersion and planktonic invertebrate densities in mesohabitats (mid-channel, banks) of a lentic side channel of over a 24-h period in August 1996. We compared our results with the only available data (the postgraduate dissertation of Tobias SCHRODER) for a floodplain side-channel of similar dimensions (River Rhine, Germany). Little diel pattern was apparent in fish density, except a decrease in relative density of bleak Alburnus alburnus L. at night that corroborated the general decrease in numbers and activity observed by SCHRODER. However, the size of bleak increased at night, which suggests increased catchability. Fish and zooplankton densities were negatively correlated, with diel patterns in Crustacea in mid-channel and along one (steep) bank. Although limited to one 24-h cycle, our results appear similar to those from floodplain ecosystems of similar river setting (large river) and differ from those observed in smaller European water courses.

J	WILSON, M				WILSON, M			MAGMATIC DIFFERENTIATION	JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY												During the past 150 years, a wide range of processes have been invoked to explain the mechanism by which magmas differentiate.These may be divided into those which operate essentially in the liquid state, such as liquid immiscibility and thermogravitational diffusion, and those which involve some form of crystal-liquid fractionation. It is now generally accepted that the latter are the most important. Many of the models developed during the past twenty years to explain magmatic differentiation have their roots in ideas first proposed in the early years of this century. This review presents some of the historical background to the subject and attempts to summarize some of the more recent developments. Alfred Harker's perceptive study of in-situ crystallization within a high-level intrusion (Carrock Fell in the English Lake District), published in volume 50 of the Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society in 1893, clearly laid the foundations for many modern theories. In 1900 he introduced the oxide-oxide variation diagram, which is still widely used to depict the geochemical variations within suites of cogenetic igneous rocks. Studies of phase equilibria in synthetic and natural systems by Bowen and his contemporaries, during the 1920s and 30s, provided the theoretical background needed to understand the complex processes involved in fractional crystallization of magmas. In the past decade mathematical modelling has allowed a more quantitative approach to the problem.

The lake model was driven by the atmospheric forcing derived from the bias-corrected projections of three global climate models in the twenty-first century under three Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). The hindcasts during 2000-2014 can reasonably capture the seasonality and magnitude of satellite retrieved lake surface temperature (LST). Future projections during 2015-2100 suggest a widespread increased LST, declined ice cover, and prolonged stratification, with the severity of changes in line with the climate driver shifts under different SSPs. Under the scenario with the highest level of anthropogenic radiative forcing (SSP5-8.5), the end-of-century (2086-2100) changes of LST, ice thickness, and stratification duration averaged across all studied lakes reach 4.90 degrees C, -0.43 m, and 65.46 days, respectively. Note that the positive ice-albedo feedback can cause excess lake warming by accelerating ice break-up (30.07 days earlier) and stratification onset (46.83 days earlier). By the end of this century, more frequent, multi-seasonal thermal extremes are anticipated to push nearly half of the studied lakes into a permanent heatwave state. Together with the remarkable LST increase and winter ice loss, the lakes will mix less frequently and may shift from a dimictic to warm monomict mixing regime. Hopefully, the irreversible thermal changes can be avoided if the anthropogenic radiative forcing is controlled within the envelope outlined by the stringent climate mitigation scenario SSP1-2.6. Lake thermodynamics play a fundamental role in controlling a wide range of physical and biogeochemical processes within lakes, for example, evaporation, nutrients and dissolved gases cycling, zooplankton and phytoplankton proliferation. This study uses lake numerical modeling to understand how climate change will affect the thermodynamics of 30 large lakes over TP, examining simulations throughout the twenty-first century under three SSPs. From 2000 to 2014 to 2086-2100, LST increase, ice loss, and stratification prolongation are anticipated across all studied lakes. These changes are more severe under the scenario with higher levels of climate driver shifts. Under the worst scenario SSP5-8.5, the above end-of-century changes reach 4.90 degrees C, -0.43 m, and 65.46 days, respectively. Additionally, by 2100, nearly half of the studied lakes will be in a constant state of "heatwave", meaning the water will be unusually warm all the time. The substantial lake warming and ice loss further cause the lakes to mix less frequently and risk shifts from a dimictic to warm monomict mixing regime. On a hopeful note, the thermal changes can possibly be controlled within the natural envelope if we adhere to the stringent climate mitigation scenario SSP1-2.6. Lake numerical modeling gains insights on the large-lake thermal response to a changing climate over TP during the twenty-first century Results from the worst scenario project substantial end-of-century changes of LST, thermal extreme, ice, stratification, and mixing regime Out-of-control thermal response can be avoided by adhering to the stringent climate mitigation scenario					Li, Jiaxin/ABG-6833-2021; Huang, Anning/K-7473-2019; 黄, 安宁/K-7473-2019; Wu, Yang/HNI-3599-2023	Huang, Anning/0000-0001-9872-440X; Wu, Yang/0000-0002-3477-7171; Li, Xin/0000-0002-8539-6504; Wen, Lijuan/0000-0001-9243-9499													2169-897X	2169-8996				APR 28	2024	129	8							e2023JD039935	10.1029/2023JD039935	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023JD039935													WOS:001204854400001
J	BANENS, RJ				BANENS, RJ			THE LIMNOLOGY OF DUMARESQ RESERVOIR - A SMALL MONOMICTIC UPLAND LAKE IN NORTHERN NEW-SOUTH-WALES, AUSTRALIA	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Dumaresq Reservoir is a small rural reservoir located at 1000 m on the tablelands of eastern Australia. The effects of drought, flood and other factors on the temporal and depth variations of physical, chemical and biological parameters were examined over a four year period. These showed that the reservoir is eutrophic and is characterized by high levels of nutrients and algae, the latter frequently dominated by blue-green algae. Nutrient-chlorophyll analysis suggested that algal growth is nitrogen limited. Extensive weed beds and nutrient-rich organic sediments confirm its eutrophic character. It exhibits strong, prolonged, shallow stratification during summer, principally as a result of low clarity caused by organic colour and high algal levels, but also due to moderate winds, partial shelter and its small fetch. The relatively large, anoxic, nutrient-rich hypolimnion regularly develops dense blooms of phototrophic sulphur bacteria. Nutrient levels and other water quality parameters are intimately tied to the prevailing hydrological regime. The ion chemistry of the reservoir and its two inflowing streams is largely influenced by geology. A heat budget and annual stability data were determined for the reservoir. Prolonged shallow stratification and blooms of phototrophic sulphur bacteria, not commonly reported for Australian waters, are believed to be typical of many rural water-supply reservoirs.																			0003-9136					JAN	1990	117	3					319	355																WOS:A1990CL11800005

We used two types of mesocosms: pelagic mesocosms with closed bottom, and benthic mesocosms open to the sediment. The experiment ran for 29 days in total. The DOC addition occurred once, at Day 1. Besides the control, there were two treatments: HuminFeed (R) (non-labile DOC) at a concentration of 2 mg L-1, and a combination of 2 mg L-1 HuminFeed (R) and 2 mg L-1 DOC from alder leaf leachate (labile). Responses were detected only in the treatment with alder leaf extract. Ecosystem processes responded immediately to DOC addition, with the fall in dissolved oxygen and pH indicating an increase in respiration, relative to primary production (Day 2). In contrast, there was a delay of a few days in structural responses in the phytoplankton community (Day 6). Phytoplankton biomass increased after DOC addition, probably boosted by the phosphorus released from alder leaf extract. Changes in phytoplankton composition towards mixotrophic taxa were not as strong as changes in biomass, and happened only in the pelagic mesocosms. With the DOC addition, diatoms prevailed in benthic mesocosms, while the contribution of colonial buoyant cyanobacteria increased in the pelagic ones. This study points towards the necessity to look in greater detail at specific responses of phytoplankton to DOC concentration increases considering lake-habitat and sediment influence.

Two massive calderas (Mount Batur 1717 m above sea level.; Mount Sangiyang 2093 m above sea level) are one of the most prominent landforms in the chain of volcanic mountain ranges of the Bali Island. Lake Batur (17,18 km(2)) and Batur Spring (which are part of the freshwater lake system of Mt. Batur caldera) and also Danau Bratan Lake (one of the unconnected lakes next to the Mt. Sangiyang caldera), were selected for studies on the pollutants concentration levels in this volcanic area located in tropical climate. The research was aimed at determining the concentration of pollutants of natural (volcanic) and anthropogenic origin occurring in both lakes. The following parameters were determined: anions, metals, pH and conductivity. Based on the obtained dataset of initial studies it can be stated that the localization of aquatic ecosystems has the significant impact on the chemical composition of surface water.

Intense windstorms in the northeastern United States	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Windstorms are a major natural hazard in many countries. The objective of this study is to identify and characterize intense windstorms during the last 4 decades in the US Northeast and determine both the sources of cyclones responsible for these events and the manner in which those cyclones differ from the cyclone climatology. The windstorm detection is based on the spatial extent of locally extreme wind speeds at 100m height from the ERA5 reanalysis database. During the top 10 windstorms, wind speeds exceed their local 99.9th percentile over at least one-third of land-based ERA5 grid cells in this high-population-density region of the USA. Maximum sustained wind speeds at 100m during these windstorms range from 26 to over 43 ms(-1), with wind speed return periods exceeding 6.5 to 106 years (considering the top 5% of grid cells during each storm). Property damage associated with these storms, with inflation adjusted to January 2020, ranges from USD 24 million to over USD 29 billion. Two of these windstorms are linked to decaying tropical cyclones, three are Alberta clippers, and the remaining storms are Colorado lows. Two of the 10 re-intensified off the east coast, leading to development of nor'easters. These windstorms followed frequently observed cyclone tracks but exhibit maximum intensities as measured using 700 hPa relative vorticity and mean sea level pressure that is 5-10 times the mean values for cyclones that followed similar tracks over this 40-year period. The time evolution of wind speeds and concurrent precipitation for those windstorms that occurred after the year 2000 exhibit good agreement with in situ ground-based and remote sensing observations, plus storm damage reports, indicating that the ERA5 reanalysis data have a high degree of fidelity for large, damaging windstorms such as these. A larger pool of the top 50 largest windstorms exhibit evidence of only weak serial clustering, which is in contrast to the relatively strong serial clustering of windstorms in Europe.

Associations between cyanobacteria and indices of secondary production in the western basin of Lake Erie	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Large lakes provide a variety of ecological services to surrounding cities and communities. Many of these services are supported by ecological processes that are threatened by the increasing prevalence of cyanobacterial blooms which occur as aquatic ecosystems experience cultural eutrophication. Over the past 10 yr, Lake Erie experienced cyanobacterial blooms of increasing severity and frequency, which have resulted in impaired drinking water for the surrounding communities. Cyanobacterial blooms may impact ecological processes that support other services, but many of these impacts have not been documented. Secondary production (production of primary consumers) is an important process that supports economically important higher trophic levels. Cyanobacterial blooms may influence secondary production because cyanobacteria are a poor-quality food resource and cyanotoxins may be harmful to consumers. Over 3 yr at 34 sites across the western basin of Lake Erie, we measured three indices of secondary production that focus on the dominant bivalve taxa: (1) growth of a native unionid mussel, (2) the size of young-of-year dreissenid mussels, and (3) the mass of colonizing animals on a Hester-Dendy sampler. Associations between these indices and cyanobacterial data were estimated to assess whether cyanobacteria are associated with variation in secondary production in the western basin of Lake Erie. The results suggest cyanobacterial abundance alone is only weakly associated with secondary production, but that cyanotoxins have a larger effect on secondary production. Given recurring late-summer cyanobacterial blooms, this impact on secondary production has the potential to undermine Lake Erie's ability to sustain important ecosystem services.

Chironomidae (Insecta: Diptera) succession in Zabieniec bog and its palaeo-lake (central Poland) through the Late Weichselian and Holocene	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Subfossil Chironomidae assemblages were studied in a sediment sequence from Zabieniec bog in central Poland. The climate history and habitat changes in the palaeo-lake were reconstructed from these assemblages. Currently no chironomid-based climate calibration set is available from Poland and so past mean July air temperatures were inferred from chironomid-climate calibration data-sets from Norway, Russia, and Switzerland. During the Late Weichselian the three calibration functions from these data-sets provided similar temperature inferences but there was some divergence in the reconstructions for the Younger Dryas and Holocene. In the late Pleniglacial, inferred summer air temperature was relatively low (8-12 degrees C) and the lake was oligotrophic. At about 16.5 ka BP, temperature rapidly rose to 15 degrees C and assemblage diversity substantially increased. During the interstadial, temperature stayed at this level. In the Younger Dryas, July air temperature was only 1-2 degrees C lower than in the interstadial, as inferred from the Norwegian calibration data-set, whereas the Russian and Swiss calibration functions did not indicate any temperature decrease. From the beginning of the Holocene, taxa typical of meso-eutrophic conditions dominated. There was an increased abundance of phytophilous species and the assemblage composition was also influenced by changes in water-level. Palaeotemperature reconstructions differed in their values. From 8.0 to 8.7 ka BP, inferences based on the Swiss and Russian data-sets indicated a cold oscillation while reconstructions based on the Norwegian data-set did not show any temperature decrease. After 2.5 ka BP assemblage diversity and head-capsule concentrations decreased. In the last millennium semi-terrestrial taxa dominated, except from Late Medieval to Early Modem times when shallow-water species reappeared. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Kleeberg, A; Herzog, C				Kleeberg, Andreas; Herzog, Christiane			Sediment microstructure and resuspension behavior depend on each other	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												The critical shear stress of resuspension and rates of erosion for cohesive and loosely structured sediments must be obtained by direct measurements since there is no theoretical calculation. An in situ experiment on sediment resuspension was performed in a shallow lake (Langer See, NE Germany; area = 1.27 km(2), z(max) = 3.8 m) in summer 2006 using a hydrodynamically calibrated erosion chamber ( 20 cm). Shear velocity (u*) was incrementally increased in 11 steps (0-2.19 cm s(-1)) to initiate resuspension events. Entrainment rates (E) of suspended particulate matter (E-SPM), total P (E-TP), chlorophyll a (E-Chl a), and soluble reactive P (E-SRP) were determined by mass balance. Two subsequent critical u* (0.53 cm s(-1) and 1.48 cm s(-1)) support the 'two-layered bed' model of a fluffy surface aggregate layer (freshly deposited phytodetritus prone to resuspension) and an underlying more consolidated biostabilised layer. Patterns in E-SPM (2-106 g m(-2) h(-1)), E-TP (11-532 mg m(-2) h(-1)), and E-Chl a (3-24 mu g m(-2) h(-1)) revealed a sediment surface maximum of TP and Chl a and their theoretical vertical logarithmic decrease within 4 mm sediment depth, the maximum thickness of sediment layer entrained. The advective E-SRP flux (17 mg m(-2) h(-1)) was 43 times higher than the diffusive SRP flux (0.4 mg m(-2) h(-1)). The TP and Chl a micro-profiles suggest that cohesive sediment bed formation is a function of both settling (fluff) and consolidation (biostabilisation). Thus, sediment microstructure and resuspension behavior depend on each other.																			0168-2563	1573-515X				JUN	2014	119	1-3					199	213		10.1007/s10533-014-9959-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-014-9959-0													WOS:000336028400013
J	MULLER, EH; FLEISHER, PJ				MULLER, EH; FLEISHER, PJ			SURGING HISTORY AND POTENTIAL FOR RENEWED RETREAT - BERING GLACIER, ALASKA USA	ARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Late Wisconsinan glacial recession uncovered a fiord where now Bering Glacier descends to the Gulf of Alaska coast. At maximum extent in the early Holocene, the fiord may have reached 50 km inland. Gradual glacial readvance may have begun by 6000 yr BP. At least by 4500 yr BP, and throughout the latter part of this advance, the glacier margin was protected against calving by its own sediment apron. Rhythmically involuted medial debris bands record frequent surging in previous centuries and perhaps throughout Neoglacial history. Air photos document surges that culminated about 1940, 1960, and 1968. An hypothesis of 20 to 30 yr surge cyclicity is strengthened by current activity. Between 1968 and 1993, retreat of 2 to 5 km on the east flank of the piedmont lobe exposed buried forest beds and outwash. Basins, eroded in this drift sequence primarily by glacial action, now contain proglacial lakes 50 to 80 m or more in depth. Continued ice recession at recent rates would, within a few years, have caused these several lakes to join as a single lake temporarily retained a few meters above sea level by an unlithified sediment barrier. Glacier retreat into deeper water, and exposure to tidal activity would have induced more active calving were it not for the surge which began in spring 1993. However, unless the current advance is unusually vigorous, it will only temporarily interrupt rather than completely reverse the recent long-term trend toward retreat.																			0004-0851					FEB	1995	27	1					81	88		10.2307/1552070	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1552070													WOS:A1995QM39200009
J	BJORCK, S				BJORCK, S			A REVIEW OF THE HISTORY OF THE BALTIC SEA, 13.0-8.0 KA BP	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												The dynamic history of the Baltic Sea during the millennia following the last deglaciation has been one of the main topics for many generations of Quatemary geologists around the Baltic Sea. Based on the present-state-of-knowledge and certain hypotheses, a model for the development during the Baltic Ice Lake, Yoldia Sea, and Ancylus Lake stages are presented. The Oresund Strait was the threshold of the initial stage of the Baltic Ice Lake and was eroded down to bedrock as a result of the isostatic uplift. The emerging threshold forced the Baltic Ice Lake to rise above sea level at ca. 12.0 ka BP, This gradual up-damning ended at ca. 11.2 ka BP when the large glacial lake was lowered 5-10 m by possible subglacial drainage at Mt. Billingen. A glacial readvance during the Younger Dryas ended a ca 400 year long land-bridge between Sweden and the continent, by blocking the former drainage route. Once again the Baltic Ice Lake had to rise above sea level to be drained over the Oresund Strait. At ca. 10.5 ka BP a gradual ice recession began, and 200 years later, when the receding ice sheet could Rot withhold the up-dammed water masses, the final drainage of the Baltic Ice Lake occurred, which rapidly lowered the water level within the Baltic basin with ca. 25 m and ended the Baltic Ice Lake stage. The next stage, the Yoldia sea, was characterized by a complex pattern of relative sea level changes with large differences within the Baltic basin, a very restricted Baltic Sea in the south, and thus an extensive landbridge. At ca. 9.9 ka BP a short (100-200 years) saline ingression is seen in the Baltic sediment records from Stockholm in the north to the southernmost parts of the Yoldia sea. The gradually shallower strait in south central Sweden (The Narke Strait) ended the saline influence. 300-400 years later the two remaining outlets west of Lake Vanem, Gota Alv and Otteid-Steinselva, had become too shallow to 'swallow' the outflowing Yoldia Sea waters. At this stage the Baltic/Lake Vanern level could thus not fall in pace with the relative sea level fall outside the outlet areas. This was the isolation of Lake Vanern and the Baltic from the sea and the beginning of the Ancylus Lake. Since the water depth of the (larger) Gota Alv outlet had to be more or less maintained, the Ancylus Lake level had to rise in pace with the uplift of the outlet region. This caused a significant and rapid transgression (10-30 m in ca. 300 years) in the southern Baltic, which flooded large areas with recently immigrated (pine) forests. Since the Oresund Strait, during the Yoldia Sea stage, had been uplifted more than southerly areas, the Ancylus transgression ended with a new drainage pathway at ca. 9.2 ka BP: through the Darss Sill area in the southern Baltic and northwards through the Store Belt Strait. This so-called Dana River had cut off the former large land-bridge. The Quaternary deposits of this new threshold were eroded and a fairly rapid regression set in. At ca. 9.0 ka BP the Dana River had eroded down to the sea level, which isolated Lake Vanern from the Ancylus Lake and created a land-bridge between southern Sweden and northwards. Ca. 800 years later, when the sea level rose above the Oresund threshold, marine water could enter the Baltic, and at ca. 8.0 ka BP brackish water characterized the southern Baltic. This marks the end of the Ancylus Lake.																			1040-6182						1995	27						19	40		10.1016/1040-6182(94)00057-C	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/1040-6182(94)00057-C													WOS:A1995RM95400004

Reconstruction of late Quaternary paleohydrologic conditions in southeastern British Columbia using visible derivative spectroscopy of Cleland Lake sediment	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Visible derivative spectroscopy (VDS) analysis of sediment from Cleland Lake, Southeastern British Columbia provides a reconstruction of paleolimnological productivity and hydrologic change during the past 14,000 calibrated C-14 years before present (cal yr BP). The first five principal components (PC) of the VDS data explain 97% of the variance in the VDS data set. Four PCs correlate with standard reflectance derivative spectra for diatom, dinoflagellate algae, and cyanophyte pigments that record ecological change, while two PCs are paleohydrologic indicators. Dinoflagellate algae are predominant from 11,600 to 8600 cal yr BP then decrease to low levels after similar to 8500 cal yr BP. PCs 3-5 represent variations in cyanophyte abundance and exhibit peaks from 14,000 to 11,600, 14,000 to 9500, and 6100 to 5400 cal yr BP, respectively. Conditions shifted toward favoring diatoms around 9400 and lasted until 170 cal yr BP. Higher dinoflagellate-related pigment concentrations suggest a lower lake level from 11,600 to 8600 cal yr BP, followed by higher water levels and wetter conditions after 8500 cal yr BP. We propose that drier conditions transitioning from the late glacial into the Holocene were caused by summer insolation-driven, non-linear feedbacks between the northern hemisphere subtropical high-pressure systems, vegetation, and soil moisture.

With respect to agriculture, changes in solar radiation, temperature, and precipitation will produce changes in crop yields, crop mix, cropping systems, scheduling of field operations, grain moisture content at harvest, and hence, on the economics of agriculture including changes in farm profitability. Such issues are addressed for 10 representative agricultural areas across the midwestern Great Lakes region, a five-state area including Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin. This region is one of the most productive and important agricultural regions in the world, with over 61% of the land use devoted to agriculture. Individual crop growth processes are affected differently by climate change. A seasonal rise in temperature will increase the developmental rate of the crop, resulting in an earlier harvest. Heat stress may result in negative effects on crop production. Conversely, increased rainfall in drier areas may allow the photosynthetic rate of the crop to increase, resulting in higher yields. Properly validated crop simulation models can be used to combine the environmental effects on crop physiological processes and to evaluate the consequences of such influences. With existing hybrids, an overall pattern of decreasing crop production under scenarios of climate change was found, due primarily to intense heat during the main growth period. However, the results changed with the hybrid of maize (Zen Inngs L.) being grown and the specific location in the study region. In general, crops grown in sites in northern states had increased yields under climate change, with those grown in sites in the southern states of the region having decreased yields under climate change. Yields from long-season maize increased significantly in the northern part of the study region under future climate change. Across the study region, long-season maize performed most successfully under future climate scenarios compared to current yields, followed by medium-season and then short-season varieties. This analysis highlights the spatial variability of crop responses to changed environmental conditions. In addition, scenarios of increased climate variability produced diverse yields on a year-to-year basis and had increased risk of a low yield. Results indicate that potential future adaptations to climate change for maize yields would require either increased tolerance of maximum summer temperatures in existing maize varieties or a change in the maize varieties grown.

Observational analysis indicated that, after removing global warming, the first leading mode of the EHT events showed a meridional dipole pattern and had significant decadal variability. During the periods 1980-1994 and 2012-2019 (1995-2011), EHT events were more frequent and stronger (less frequent and weaker) in western-central Siberia than normal, whereas they were less frequent and weaker (more frequent and stronger) in the wide area to the south of Lake Baikal. Further Observational and CESM (Community Earth System Model) results based analysis suggested that decadal change in air-sea interaction in the North Atlantic play an important role in shaping the decadal variability of EHT events in MHLCA. On decadal timescales, meridional negative-positive-negative sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the North Atlantic and their coupled positive North Atlantic Oscillation can trigger stronger wave activity flux and cause a significant anticyclonic-cyclonic teleconnection wave train in the troposphere over the mid and high latitudes of the Eurasian continent. As a result, an anomalous high-pressure center is evident in western-central Siberia, and thereby reducing total cloud cover and causing stronger solar heating. Thus, EHT events become more frequent and stronger. On the contrary, for the areas south of Lake Baikal, EHT events are weakened by corresponding cyclonic circulation anomalies. Additionally, the CAM5 (Community Atmosphere Model version 5) experiments suggested more important driving role of the decadal North Atlantic tripole SST anomalies in the abovementioned processes.					; Miao, Jiapeng/GYJ-5841-2022; Wang, Tao/AAI-9782-2020	Miao, Jiapeng/0000-0001-5815-6428; 													0930-7575	1432-0894				NOV	2023	61	9-10					4587	4601		10.1007/s00382-023-06823-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-023-06823-6		MAY 2023											WOS:000989513200001
B	Rugh, SS		Cannon, BQ; Embry, JL		Rugh, Susan Sessions			Selling Sleep The Rise and Fall of Utah's Historic Motels	UTAH IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY												From the Progressive Era onward, boosters in Utah who belonged to organizations like the Salt Lake Commercial Club promoted convention and business travel to the Beehive State. Early promotional materials emphasized the Great Salt Lake and Mormon historic sites, but by the mid-1940s, the newly organized Utah Tourist and Publicity Council attempted to lure tourists by highlighting the state's national parks and mountains as well as water recreation and Temple Square. Susan Sessions Rugh describes the new lodging accommodations-motor courts and motels-that catered to automobile travelers during the 1940s and '50s in Salt Lake City, St. George, and near the state's national parks. Using promotional postcards, Rugh illuminates the amenities and facilities available to tourists, the ways motel owners highlighted local culture and scenery in their logos and neon signs, and the descriptions of their vacations that visitors chose to share with friends and relatives to whom they sent the cards. As the number of tourists rose and an interstate highway system funneled travelers more efficiently from one destination to another, national lodging chains superseded many of the smaller, locally owned motels. This was one of many ways in which the very success of tourism undercut local Utahns' ability to profit from it.																					978-0-87421-745-2; 978-0-87421-744-5				2009							65	87																WOS:000294543700005

Consequently, specific source and amounts of nutrient discharge to tributaries of the Tahoe Basin are difficult to identify. The sediment content and nitrate and ammonium levels in surface runoff from two soil types (Meeks and Umpa), four plot conditions (wooded natural and disturbed, open natural and disturbed), and three slopes (gentle, moderate, and steep) were studied using rainfall simulation that applied a 9 cm h-1, 1-h event. A significant (P < 0.005) two-way interaction between soil type and plot condition affected runoff nitrate concentration. Runoff from natural or disturbed open plots contained significantly (P = 0.05) greater nitrate than wooded plots. Peak concentrations of nitrate commonly occurred during early runoff, suggesting that peak nitrate discharge to Lake Tahoe tributaries can be expected during early runoff from snowmelt and summer precipitation events. The highest nitrate runoff concentration and 1-h cumulative loading from the 0.46 m2 plots were 6.7 mg L-1 (Umpa, open natural, 15-30 percent slope), and 0.7 mg (Umpa, open natural, > 30 percent slope), respectively. Ammonium in surface runoff was generally below detection limits (< 0.05 mug L-1). No statistical relationship between runoff nitrate and sediment discharge was detected.																			0043-1370					MAY-JUN	1994	30	3					409	417																WOS:A1994NV62300005

Despite their relevance, a taxonomic revision was necessary due to the lack of detailed morphological descriptions. Here, we provide the first comprehensive anatomical characterization of the soft parts of both species. Our findings also underscore the diagnostic value of female genital morphology for ostracod species identification. We evaluate intra- and interspecific morphological variability across multiple populations, documenting size variation in both species and ornamentation differences in L. rionegroensis. Morphometric and anatomical analyses confirm that these variations fall within the range of intraspecific variability. We also explore the environmental preferences, geographic distributions, and significance of these taxa as climate indicators. Both species exhibit broad distributions across northern and southern Patagonia. Although they rarely co-occur in modern or recent assemblages, they are frequently found together in the sedimentary record, suggesting that limited coexistence may result from narrow environmental tolerances rather than geographic isolation. Our results clarify the taxonomic status and ensure the nomenclatural stability of both species. By integrating taxonomic, morphometric, environmental, and geographic data from numerous populations, this study improves the accuracy and reliability of paleoenvironmental reconstructions in Patagonia-a key region for understanding Holocene climate dynamics in the Southern Hemisphere.

The new species is characterized by the following diagnostic characters: 1) an eight-segmented female antennule, 2) the absence of an inner seta on the second exopodal segment of P1, 3) the distal segments of the exopod of P2 to P4 are as long as the other two segments combined, and 4) there are six setae on the basoendopod of the female P5. This species has a slight resemblance to the "hiemalis" group. However, the new species is clearly distinguishable from the species in the "hiemalis" group by the combination of ornamentation of the free margin of the operculum, the number of setae on the P4 endopod, the length/width ratio of the P5 exopod in the female, and the number of setae on the first endopod segment and the lengths of each apical seta on the last endopod segment of P3 in the male. Thus far, 22 species have been reported in the subgenus Echinocamptus, and the "hiemalis" group includes ten species. Species in this group are typically found in the interstitial groundwater around springs, lakes, streams, and caves. The new species described herein is the first described member of the subgenus Echinocamptus from caves in Korea.

Impacts of European settlement (1840-present) in a Great Lake watershed and lagoon: Frenchman's Bay, Lake Ontario, Canada	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The northern shore of Lake Ontario is one of the longest settled parts of Canada beginning around 1795. Accelerated settlement and deforestation after 1840 resulted in massive soil loss from easily-eroded Pleistocene glacial landscapes and the siltation of creeks and lagoons. Channel capacity was reduced but river flow was enhanced by diminished infiltration resulting in straightening of meandering channels, accelerated erosion of stream banks, increased incidence of downstream flooding and large influxes of mud to Lake Ontario. Conservation measures after World War II were successful but rapid urban sprawl after 1970 hardened watersheds and badly impacted the quality and quantity of surface and ground waters flowing to Lake Ontario. The Frenchman's Bay watershed (27 km(2)) 50 km east of Toronto is one of the country's most urbanized (pop: 100,000; 76 % urban cover) and is crossed by Canada's busiest highway (Highway 401). The watershed drains to Lake Ontario through a coastal lagoon (Frenchman's Bay) in which pre-settlement postglacial carbonate is abruptly overlain by a 'European settlement' mud layer rich in weed pollen and organic debris; the uppermost 'urban' part of this deposit shows elevated level of metals and other contaminants. This layer records soil loss after 1840 and more recently, the influx of contaminated urban waters and sediment. Some 7,600 tonnes of road salt have been applied to the lagoon watershed each year producing spikes of brackish surface runoff during winter thaws. Some 50 % of the total salt applied to the entire watershed is conveyed directly to Frenchman's Bay Lagoon via surface runoff; the rest enters the groundwater system resulting in year-round brackish baseflow to creeks. Chloride continues to be stored in underlying aquifers such that the system has yet to reach a steady-state discharge. Future salinity of baseflow reaching the lagoon can be expected to increase by about 40 %. Rapid migration of contaminated groundwater is facilitated by the widespread presence of thick (< 8 m) coarse-grained and heterogeneous fill materials of the built landscape. The watershed is experiencing ongoing changes in land use as urban infilling proceeds. The aquatic ecology of inflowing creeks to the lagoon has been greatly impacted resulting in major loss of wetlands and submergent vegetation and distinct changes in the structure of fish populations. This is the most detailed study of an urban watershed in Canada; lack of knowledge elsewhere is a constraint on the design and testing of mitigation measures and is a major impediment to assessing the impact of ongoing climate change on urban water resources, and the effects of urban runoff on Great Lakes water quality.																			1866-6280	1866-6299				APR	2013	68	8					2211	2228		10.1007/s12665-012-1904-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-012-1904-8													WOS:000316749900008

Therefore, this study intended to conduct the reconstruction of this flood event through an integrative approach, combining rainfall-generated runoff simulation and GLOF modelling using the Hydrologic Engineering Center - Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) and Hydrologic Engineering Center - River Analysis System (HEC-RAS), respectively. The peak discharge estimated at Singtam from the HEC-HMS simulation, reflecting solely the rainfall effect, was 2409 m(3)/s. In this contrast, the HEC-RAS modelling, which encompasses both rainfalls-induced runoff and GLOF from SLL, reveals a peak discharge of 6562.95 m(3)/s. The results were optimised and validated by the flood parameter information of some active gauge sites of Central Water Commission (CWC) falls on the flood path. In summary, such studies improve the understanding by estimating and analysing the quantitative parameters of these events that occur during intense precipitation and sudden breaches of glacial lakes, coincidingly, which often occur in high mountain regions.

J	LEHMAN, JT				LEHMAN, JT			HYPOLIMNETIC METABOLISM IN LAKE WASHINGTON - RELATIVE EFFECTS OF NUTRIENT LOAD AND FOOD WEB STRUCTURE ON LAKE PRODUCTIVITY	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The general metabolism of carbon, oxygen, phosphate, nitrate, and silicate in the hypolimnion of Lake Washington is examined from 23 yr of record. Magnitudes of net consumptive and regenerative processes in the water column and sediments are identified and stoichiometries of regeneration in situ are calculated. Aerobic respiration appears to be almost equally divided between the water column and sediment surface. Net nitrification is more rapid in the water column, and silicate regeneration is confined to the sediment surface. Nutrients do not accumulate on average at the Redfield ratio. Rates of hypolimnetic oxygen consumption are compared to production rates inferred independently from 14C and oxygen bottle assays. A third of all gross primary production is respired in the hypolimnion of Lake Washington during spirng and summer, but the proportion was significantly lower during an episode of cultural eutrophication int he 1960s. Rates of primary production and hypolimnetic processes decreased in response to changes in nutrient income when effluents from waste treatment plants were diverted from the lake. After a period of recovery from eutrophication. Lake Washington experienced a second basinwide perturbation involving alteration of the planktonic heribovore community. The change in food web structure failed to produce a response comparable to that of latered nutrient loading. Despite inferred changes in algal growth rates and in species composition, total primary productivity and rates of hypolimnetic metabolism did not change.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	1988	33	6	1				1334	1347		10.4319/lo.1988.33.6.1334	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1988.33.6.1334													WOS:A1988T062500011

Wisconsin and Minnesota were compared with the range maps of eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carr.) and American beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.) in the early nineteenth century, compiled from the bearing-tree records of the U.S. Public Land Survey. The species limit shown in the land-survey records corresponds within a few kilometres to the limit of living trees. Pollen percentages for both species in presettlement lake sediment fall to low levels 15-20 km beyond the land-survey range limit. Percentages are variable within 10 km of the species limit, and therefore the position of the limit cannot be determined from pollen percentages at a single site. With a grid of fossil sites, however, it is possible to identify an area 20 km wide that includes the past species limit. On the basis of our data from the Great Lakes region, the past existence of outlying colonies of hemlock and beech can be demonstrated if pollen percentages at a fossil site are consistently higher than at surrounding sites, but it is impossible to prove from pollen that outlying colonies do not exist. Although regression models lead to similar conclusions, information about pollen percentages outside the species limit provided by y-intercept values is less precise than information from a geographical grid of sites.					; Schwartz, Mark/G-1066-2011	Woods, Kerry/0000-0003-1029-6995; Schwartz, Mark/0000-0002-3739-6542													0305-0270	1365-2699				NOV	1991	18	6					653	668		10.2307/2845547	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2845547													WOS:A1991GT20300007

Application of the WHO alert level framework to cyanobacterial monitoring of Lake Champlain, Vermont	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY												The increasing incidence of toxic cyanobacteria blooms worldwide has created a need for practical and efficient monitoring in order to protect public health. We developed a monitoring and alert framework based on World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations and applied it on Lake Champlain during the summers of 2002-2004. The protocol began with collection of net samples of phytoplankton in order to maximize the chance of finding potential toxin-producing cyanobacteria. Samples were collected lakewide in partnership with ongoing monitoring efforts, but because open water sample sites did not capture conditions along the shoreline, we added near-shore and shoreline stations in problem areas. Samples were examined qualitatively until potential toxin-producing taxa were found. Then quantitative analyses began, using a rapid screening method to estimate cell density based on colony size. A final cell density of 4000 cells/mL triggered toxin analyses. Primary analysis was for microcystins using ELISA methods. Cell densities, locations of colonies, and toxin concentrations were reported weekly to public health officials. We found that screening for potential toxin-producing cyanobacteria and then measuring toxin concentrations when cell densities reached critical levels Worked well to identify problem locations. Although the WHO recommends using chlorophyll a concentration, it was not a good indicator of problem densities of potential toxin-producing cyanobacteria. Our cell density screening method missed no developing. blooms but produced less precise density estimates at high cell counts. Overall, our framework appears to provide an efficient and effective method for monitoring cyanotoxin risks. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We present and validate a new LIT retrieval method that utilizes ICESat-2 data to assist CryoSat-2 echo peak selection, aiming to improve the accuracy of LIT retrieval and enable data acquisition without on-site measurements. The method involves screening out similar ICESat-2 and CryoSat-2 tracks based on time and space constraints. It also involves dynamically adjusting the range constraint window of CryoSat-2 waveforms based on the high-precision lake ice surface ellipsoid height obtained from ICESat-2/ATL06 data. Within this range constraint window, the peak selection strategy is used to determine the scattering interfaces between snow-ice and ice-water. By utilizing the distance between the scattering horizons, the thickness of the lake ice can be determined. We performed the ice thickness retrieval experiment for Baker Lake in winter and verified it against the on-site measurement data. The results showed that the accuracy was about 0.143 m. At the same time, we performed the ice thickness retrieval experiment for Great Bear Lake (GBL), which does not have on-site measurement data, and compared it with the climate change trend of GBL. The results showed that the retrieval results were consistent with the climate change trend of GBL, confirming the validity of the proposed method.

To find a suitable marking method, young-of-the-year (YOY, length 8-10 cm) pikeperch (Stizostedion lucioperca) were tagged in different ways and stocked in ponds. Over a 185-day winter period, there was no significant size-dependent mortality, but clear differences in mortality among fish marked in different ways. Fingerling and streamer-tagged fish had significantly lower survivorship than fin-clipped (left pelvic fin) and colour-marked (Alcian Blue) fish, which were not different from controls. Seventeen thousand, seven hundred sixty-six YOY pikeperch were fin-clipped and released in a large bay of the Baltic Sea on the Swedish east coast in October 1991. The following year, 23% of all 1-yr-old fish caught came from this stocking. The proportion of marked fish was considerably higher close to the release site, showing that they were relatively stationary during their first year of life. A simple economic analysis demonstrates that pikeperch stocking can be very profitable. Based on the capital invested in the stocked YOY, the economic yield corresponds to an annual interest rate of 43%.

This paper presents a proof-of-concept system that enables library users to search musically for songs or pieces that match to sung, hummed, or typed note queries. We chose to work with a corpus of 80 Lakeland Hunting Song tunes (Items) that have been collected recently, and for which the archivist wanted to make a resource that was easily searchable in terms of its musical content. Existing systems such as that at folktunefinder.com are robust to rhythmic changes but not to missing or interpolated notes, so we employed a geometric hashing approach as the basis for determining matches and as a potential improvement on existing work. An evaluation indicates that the system works quickly and effectively. We discuss some of the examples arising from its use, and indicate how future work building on this proof-of-concept system may make it possible to search other collections of songs or pieces in a more natural, musical way.

J	HENRIKSEN, A; WRIGHT, RF				HENRIKSEN, A; WRIGHT, RF			CONCENTRATIONS OF HEAVY-METALS IN SMALL NORWEGIAN LAKES	WATER RESEARCH												As part of regional surveys of lakes in Norway the concentrations of Zn, Pb, Cu and Cd were measured in surface- and bottom-water samples collected from representative, small, pristine lakes (136 in southern Norway sampled in Oct. 1974, 58 resampled in March 1975 and 77 in northern Norway sampled in March 1975). The lakes, a statistically representative sample of small lakes in Norway, were chosen such that their watersheds are undisturbed. Heavy-metal concentrations in these lakes thus reflect only natural inputs and anthropogenic inputs via the atmosphere. The generally low concentrations (Zn 0.5-12.0 .mu.g l-1; Pb 0-2.0 .mu.g l-1; Cu 0-2.0 .mu.g l-1; Cd 0.1-0.5 .mu.g l-1) measured in lakes in central and northern Norway provide estimates of natural background levels. These estimates may be too high because they include the global-scale deposition of heavy metals from the atmosphere which increased as a result of industrial activities. Concentrations of Zn and Pb in lakes in southernmost and southeastern Norway lie above these background levels, apparently because of atmospheric deposition associated with the acidic precipitation that falls over southern Scandinavia. Increased heavy-metal concentrations in acid lakes may also be due to increased mobilization of metals due to acidification of soil- and surface-waters.

Here, we collected monthly dusts samples for one year and we studied the distribution, pollution levels, and sources of microplastics in atmospheric dust fall in the Ebinur Lake Basin in Northwest China. Results showed that the average content of dust microplastic on construction land was 28.61 +/- 1.13 mg/kg, followed by farmland (20.25 +/- 1.56 mg/kg), forest (19.52 +/- 1.06 mg/kg), and deserts (8.08 +/- 0.56 mg/kg). Regarding different land use types, atmospheric dust reduction dominated on farmland (58.64%), followed by urban area (26.65%), forest (9.76%), and desert (4.95%). Regarding the shape of microplastics, the order of occurrence in dust was film (46.85%) > fiber (35.15%) > foam(12.35%) > fragment (5.65%). In this study, four colors of microplastics were found in dust, and white accounted for the largest proportion (52.15%), followed by transparent (18.65%), black (19.45%), and green (9.75%). The main components of film microplastics in atmospheric dustfall in the Ebinur Lake Basin were PE and PP, and their sources were mainly plastic products in daily life, plastic industrial packaging materials from urban enterprises, broken plastic woven bags, and PET mostly from fabric fragment emissions. The abundance of microplastics in dust was correlated with atmospheric dust pH, EC, and total salt content. The contents of seven heavy metals (Cu, Ni, Cd, Pb, Cr, Mn, and Co) adsorbed by microplastics were also correlated with pH, EC, and total salt content. Our results represent a reference for microplastics pollution prevention in mountain terrains and foothills areas in northwest China and Central Asia.

J	Graney, JR; Eriksen, TM				Graney, JR; Eriksen, TM			Metals in pond sediments as archives of anthropogenic activities: a study in response to health concerns	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY					Annual Meeting of the Geological-Society-of-America	2002	Denver, CO	Geol Soc Amer				An environmental geochemistry approach was applied in response to health concerns about present day and past exposure to pollutants within Broome County, New York by determining historical records of anthropogenic activities as preserved in sediment cores. Sediment was collected from a stormwater retention pond adjacent to a warehouse complex in the urban community of Hillcrest as well as from 3 other ponds in rural locations in Broome County. Metal concentrations and decay products of Pb-210 and Cs-137 were measured to determine the timing of source specific differences in the distribution of metals in the sediment cores. Concentrations of Zn, Pb, Ni, Cu, Cr, Cd and As were elevated in the retention pond sediments when compared to sediment from other locations. Topography influenced atmospheric transport and deposition of pollutants within incised river valleys and enhanced runoff from impervious surfaces within an urban watershed contributed to the elevated metal concentrations at Hillcrest. Temporal changes in Pb deposition within retention pond sediment mimic the rise and fall in use of leaded gasoline. Arsenic concentrations decreased following placement of emission controls on nearby coal-fired power plant sources. Superimposed over the temporal trends of Pb and As are co-varying Zn, Ni, Cu, Cr and Cd concentrations; a suite of metals commonly used in metal plating processes by local industries. Analysis of sediment in stormwater retention ponds in other urban areas may provide opportunities for detailed records of pollution history to be obtained in many communities. Residents in urban communities located in incised river valley locations similar to Hillcrest may be particularly prone to enhanced exposure to metals from anthropogenic sources.

J	KOENINGS, JP; HOOPER, FF				KOENINGS, JP; HOOPER, FF			INFLUENCE OF COLLOIDAL ORGANIC-MATTER ON IRON AND IRON-PHOSPHORUS CYCLING IN AN ACID BOG LAKE	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The relationship between Fe and P and the relationship of these elements to colloidal organic matter (COM) was studied in a meromictic acid bog lake by chemical characterization, filtration and in situ dialysis and in situ experiments with labeled components. Bathophenanthroline (BPN) reactive ferrous Fe existed in true solution (dialyzable) in constantly anaerobic monimolimnetic water; in the aerobic epilimnion reactive ferric Fe was of colloidal size. Intermediate depths, oxygenated only during spring, contained 2 forms of ferrous Fe reactive to BPN; dialyzable ferrous iron (Fe2+) and colloidal Fe(II) which may have originated through in situ reduction of colloidal reactive ferric Fe and may be present as a COM-Fe2+ complex. The amount of COM influenced the fate of dialyzable Fe2+ (92% of total Fe) and dialyzable PO4-P (85% of total P) present in anaerobic strata before aeration. Aeration with soluble organic matter present (COM absent) resulted in the formation of colloidal nonreactive ferric Fe (84% of total Fe) and 65% colloidal PO4-P, while aeration with 26 mg/l COM resulted in only 36% colloidal, nonreactive ferric Fe and 19% colloidal PO4-P. COM apparently masks the cationic properties of colloidal ferric Fe and retards the formation of nonreactive Fe(III), allowing most of the PO4-P to remain free in solution and biologically available.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1976	21	5					684	696		10.4319/lo.1976.21.5.0684	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1976.21.5.0684													WOS:A1976CC00500006

Inferring Adaptive Nature of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Polymorphism from Single Nucleotide Substitutions in Asian Sockeye Salmon Populations: I. Different Forms of Selection Act in Sockeye Salmon Populations from the Ozernaya and Kamchatka Rivers	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF GENETICS												Variability of the Onne-DAB gene, which encodes the -chain of class II major histocompatibility complex molecule (MHCII), is studied using One_MHC2_109, One_MHC2_190v2, and One_MHC2_251v2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the two largest Asian-Pacific coast populations of sockeye salmon that reproduce in the Ozernaya River and Kamchatka River basins. Differences in the nature of inheritance and degree of polymorphism of One_MHC2_190v2 and One_MHC2_251v2 are observed in samples from both lake-river systems, whereas One_MHC2_109 was uninformative. Samples collected from the lake and river spawning grounds of Lake Kurilskoe are characterized by high estimates of intrapopulation genetic diversity, whereas no intersample differences are revealed in the frequencies of haplotypes and phenotypes of the joint MHC2 locus. This can be interpreted as the result of balancing selection in sequences encoding the MHCII peptide-binding region in this sockeye salmon population. This hypothesis is also confirmed by Ewens-Watterson neutrality tests. On the contrary, low genetic diversity estimates and significant heterogeneity of haplotype and phenotypic frequencies at the MHC2 locus are observed in the samples of early (spring) sockeye salmon from the Kamchatka River basin, apparently owing to the action of directional pathogen-induced selection in the Onne-DAB gene in some localities of the lake-river system.

Up to very recently it was thought that the latest eruption prior to the 2008 event occurred c. 9750 cal. a BP. Although a number of researchers have recognised additional eruptive products, but their stratigraphy, age, and geochemical attributes have not been systematically described and/or recorded. In this study, we provide a detailed examination of andic cover-beds and tephra-bearing lake sequences located both proximally and distally to VCha, which record a series of hitherto unknown rhyolitic eruptive products and place all previous observations firmly within a coherent stratigraphic framework. Through major- and trace-element glass shard geochemistry we are able to confidently verify eruptive source. A total of 20 discrete tephra beds are recognised, with at least 10 having widespread areal distributions and/or depositional imprints broadly comparable to, or greater than, the 2008-tephra event. This record indicates that VCha has been continuously but intermittently active as far back as the end of the Last Glacial Maximum (c. 18,000 cal a BP) with two dominant, genetically related magma types and an intermediary 'mixed' type. Before this the eruptive record has been largely obscured and/or erased by widespread Andean piedmont glaciation. However, based on the tempo of VCha activity over the last c. 18,000 years, older VCha eruptives can be anticipated to occur as well as future hazardous explosive events. The new eruptive inventory will ultimately be useful for correlating equivalent-aged sequences and refining long-term eruptive tempo as well as corresponding temporal changes in magmatic evolution.

In response, oyster reefs have been created with many different approaches. This study utilized intertidal reefs constructed with oyster shells recycled from local restaurants to provide oyster settlement substrate, reef-associated faunal habitat, and a barrier to prevent marsh erosion. The objective of this study was to determine how oyster population characteristics changed over four years (2016-2019) on five different reefs within Sweetwater Lake, Galveston Bay, Texas, with a secondary objective to examine how oyster populations responded after Hurricane Harvey. Over the study period, five different reefs were sampled each summer by removing five bags per reef to determine oyster abundance and size demography. For the three years of the study (2017-2019), we also quantified oyster spat recruitment to the reefs. Oyster abundance and size (shell height) varied interactively by year and reef number, whereas oyster recruitment was significantly lower following Hurricane Harvey and then returned to pre-storm levels. Our results further highlight the importance of reef placement for breakwater-style reefs, as it appears the hydrodynamics within Sweetwater Lake influenced both oyster abundance and size among individual reefs. While the created reefs receive limited larval influx due to the narrow opening between Sweetwater Lake and Galveston Bay proper, this limited connectivity seemed to prevent mass mortality from the freshwater influx from Hurricane Harvey. Therefore, projects creating oyster reefs should consider local and regional landscape factors for the long-term success of oyster populations and robustness to natural disasters.

The results of the research revealed that the population is made up of eight age-classes. The sex ratio proved to be extremely unbalanced (1 : 19 in favour of females). Growth can be deemed rapid, the von Bertalanffy growth in length function being TL = 43.019{1-e((-0.272(t+0.162)))} for the total sample and phi' = 2.702. No sexual dimorphism in growth was observed. Back-calculation analysis suggested the existence of an inverse Lee phenomenon among 1 year-old specimens. The reproductive period covers a broad time-span, from March to June. In females, sexual maturity is reached after the second winter of life (2+ age-class); however, a small percentage (7.55%) of females is able to reproduce at the age of I year. Most of the males attained sexual maturity in the first year (60.61%). The reproductive investment of the females is high; the relationship between SL and the number of eggs was N-c = 0.0041 SL4.368. Fecundity varied from 286 to 219104 eggs, with an average relative fecundity of 103 +/- 5 eggs g(-1); the mean diameter of the eggs was 1.27 +/- 0.01 mm. The reproductive investment of the females was not homogeneous across the age-classes; in addition to absolute fecundity, relative fecundity and egg diameter were seen to increase with the size of the specimens.

Poyang Lake is an important wintering habitat on the migration route of tundra swans. However, the relationship between water level and suitable habitat area is still largely unknown. Therefore, this study employed Maxent to model and predict the five leading environmental factors and their corresponding thresholds affecting the habitat selection of tundra swans. Based on this, the study assessed habitat suitability for tundra swans at different water levels and discussed how water level changes impacted the habitats. Results showed that: (1) Soil humidity, distance to settlements, elevation, wetland landscape type, and NDVI (Normalized difference vegetation index) played dominant roles in the habitat selection of tundra swans. (2) The southwestern lakelets were preferred habitats for tundra swans, whereas the lake branches in the northern region were potentially suitable at various water levels. The eastern area of the study area was more affected by water level changes than the western area. (3) There was a significant correlation between habitat area and water level change.

J	Scheifhacken, N; Fiek, C; Rothhaupt, KO				Scheifhacken, Nicole; Fiek, Christian; Rothhaupt, Karl-Otto			Complex spatial and temporal patterns of littoral benthic communities interacting with water level fluctuations and wind exposure in the littoral zone of a large lake	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												The spatial and temporal organisation of benthic invertebrate communities was studied in a large oligotrophic lake in central Europe. Three shallow littoral sites at 0.4 m depth were sampled monthly from May 2002 to April 2003. On a spatial scale, the benthic community composition at all sites and in all samplings significantly differed in both abundance and biomass. On a temporal scale, the benthic communities at all sites gradually changed each month; monthly samples always significantly differed, but samples from consecutive months were more similar to each other than to samples of non-consecutive months. The observed variability within benthic communities corresponded with changes in the abiotic parameters water level and wind exposure, but was best explained by short- and long-term fluctuations in the water level. Effects of wind exposure were most pronounced in the winter months, when high wind events most often occurred. However, wind effects were masked by stronger effects, such as water-level fluctuation within the shallow littoral zone, or diminished by parameters with opposite effects, e.g. slope vs. exposure. Wind-induced shear stress in the upper eulittoral zone directly influenced the abundance and biomass of the benthic community to a lesser extent. We conclude, however, that this stress alters habitats constantly (e.g. substrate composition, periphyton growth, resuspension vs. sedimentation) and is therefore the driving force for the reported permanent site differences. Furthermore, benthic communities were well adapted to frequent minor changes and also to regular major changes of their habitat, as bare substrates were rapidly recolonised within a month.																			1863-9135						2007	169	2					115	129		10.1127/1863-9135/2007/0169-0115	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/1863-9135/2007/0169-0115													WOS:000248232900003

Isimila Prehistoric Site, Tanzania: Comparative Faunal Datings and ESR, with a Reassessment	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES												More than sixty years ago, 1957-58 University of Chicago excavations at the Isimila Prehistoric Site in the Southern Highlands of Tanzania exposed a sequence of Pleistocene deposits that included Earlier Stone Age aggregates. Now, the available correlations with extinct fauna from other dated East African localities and preliminary electron spin resonance (ESR) estimates indicate that the Isimila Formation was deposited over a much longer time range than originally proposed. As originally noted, Earlier Stone Age 'large cutting tools' or LCT's found in the upper Lisalamagasi Member are more refined than are those found in the Sands units of the lower Lukingi Member. This suggests a correlation with Kalambo Falls Prehistoric Site for the upper member, with new OSL dating at ca. 400-500 ka. The new faunal correlations and ESR estimates indicate that the lower member was deposited between 500 and 900 ka, during the later Early Pleistocene to the early Middle Pleistocene. A reassessment of Isimila including unpublished excavation data raises questions about the Pleistocene human occupations and their palaeoenvironments on the Highlands Plateau.																			1464-343X	1879-1956				MAR	2024	211								105156	10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2023.105156	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jafrearsci.2023.105156		JAN 2024											WOS:001170956500001

This i.e. formation consists of alluvial terrigenous deposits, with local dominance of carbonates and microbialites, which are the main focus of this study. Three sfacies associations are differentiated: i) bioclastic facies association including limestone levels with accumulation of gastropods and charophytes, along with polygenetic carbonate breccias; ii) microbialite facies association dominated by irregular limestone beds rich in oncoids; iii) terrigenous facies association including metric levels of reddish-brown mudstone with intercalations of sandstones and conglomerates. These facies deposited in a low water level and short residence lacustrine-palustrine environments, in the distal areas of an alluvial system. Isotopic data (813C and 818O) fall in the range of freshwater carbonates and support this interpretation. The most common microbialites are oncoids, which have been classified into six types based on their morphology, size, and lamination. Cyclic patterns in the lamination of oncoids have been related to changing wet and dry conditions. Our results suggest that the alluvial setting was mainly fed by meteoric waters, with a sub-humid climate gradually transitioning to more arid conditions.

We established a tree-ring width network based on two new chronologies and four previously published chronologies. Correlation and response function analyses demonstrate that precipitation positively influences radial growth. Despite of minor differences in local climate-growth relations, precipitation for the annual window between previous July and current June shows consistent positive correlations with ring width at all study sites. Similar to the so called 'pointer year' approach, 'anomalous' growth years were defined to extract extreme climate events for the period AD 1450-2006. We defined a dryness-wetness grade series with five grades of climate events inferred from anomalous year analysis. During the last 50 years, the frequency of wet events increased and that of drought events decreased noticeably, implying that the probability of occurrence of dry years in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau will further decrease in the future if regional warming continues. Combining our proxy records with a historical dryness-wetness record from eastern China, we mapped dryness-wetness patterns over large parts of China. By analyzing the atmospheric pressure patterns at the 850 hPa level over China for selected extreme event years, we found that the confluence of cold and hot air is a precondition for a flood event in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. Thus, a counter-clockwise atmospheric circulation centered in south of Lake Baikal only occurs in flood event years. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Water and dissolved gas geochemistry at Coatepeque, Ilopango and Chanmico volcanic lakes (El Salvador, Central America)	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												Coatepeque (on the E slope of Santa Ana Volcano), Ilopango (inside Ilopango Caldera) and Chanmico (associated with San Salvador Volcano) are volcanic lakes in El Salvador, showing a thermocline at a relatively shallow depth (from 30 to 40 m, from 20 to 40 m and from 5 to 15 m depth, respectively) and anoxic conditions below 33, 24 and 4 m depth, respectively. The Na+ -Cl- composition of the Coatepeque and Ilopango lakes, displaying TDS values up to 1226 and 1216 mg/L, respectively, is likely due to hydrothermal fluids that feed these two lakes, as also confirmed by Cl /Br molar ratios <= 650, high As, B, Li and Si contents and Cl /SO42 ratio > 1. The Mg2+-HCO3 water composition of Lake Chanmico, whose TDS values were between 566 and 856 mg/L, suggests water-rock interaction processes with mafic/ultramafic rocks variably affected by serpentinization processes, which produced high Mg2+, Si and B concentrations. Waters at depth were characterized by the presence of CO2 from an extra-lacustrine source, as suggested by delta(13) C-CO2 values significantly less negative than those typically related to biogenic processes, albeit this gas was found in smaller quantities when compared to those recorded in other meromictic lakes hosted in quiescent volcanic systems (e.g. Lake Kivu in DRC, Monticchio, Albano and Averno lakes in Italy, Hule and Rio Cuarto lakes in Costa Rica, Lake Pavin in France). The occurrence of CH4, whose concentrations in lake Chanmico were up to two orders of magnitude higher than those recorded in Coatepeque and Ilopango lakes, suggests bacterial methanogenesis.

Impacts of the 2014 severe drought on the Microcystis bloom in San Francisco Estuary	HARMFUL ALGAE												The increased frequency and intensity of drought with climate change may cause an increase in the magnitude and toxicity of freshwater cyanobacteria harmful algal blooms (CHABs), including Microcystis blooms, in San Francisco Estuary, California. As the fourth driest year on record in San Francisco Estuary, the 2014 drought provided an opportunity to directly test the impact of severe drought on cyanobacteria blooms in SFE. A field sampling program was conducted between July and December 2014 to sample a suite of physical, chemical, and biological variables at 10 stations in the freshwater and brackish reaches of the estuary. The 2014 Microcystis bloom had the highest biomass and toxin concentration, earliest initiation, and the longest duration, since the blooms began in 1999. Median chlorophyll a concentration increased by 9 and 12 times over previous dry and wet years, respectively. Total microcystin concentration also exceeded that in previous dry and wet years by a factor of 11 and 65, respectively. Cell abundance determined by quantitative PCR indicated the bloom contained multiple potentially toxic cyanobacteria species, toxic Microcystis and relatively high total cyanobacteria abundance. The bloom was associated with extreme nutrient concentrations, including a 20-year high in soluble reactive phosphorus concentration and low to below detection levels of ammonium. Stable isotope analysis suggested the bloom varied with both inorganic and organic nutrient concentration, and used ammonium as the primary nitrogen source. Water temperature was a primary controlling factor for the bloom and was positively correlated with the increase in both total and toxic Microcystis abundance. In addition, the early initiation and persistence of warm water temperature coincided with the increased intensity and duration of the Microcystis bloom from the usual 3 to 4 months to 8 months. Long residence time was also a primary factor controlling the magnitude and persistence of the bloom, and was created by a 66% to 85% reduction in both the water inflow and diversion of water for agriculture during the summer. We concluded that severe drought conditions can lead to a significant increase in the abundance of Microcystis and other cyanobacteria, as well as their associated toxins. (C) 2017 The Authors.

The content of organic carbon, inorganic carbon, and biogenic silica, as well as the benthic remains of ostracods and oligochaetes, are converted into accumulation rates and benthic abundances in order to assess past production rates and bottom water oxygen status, respectively. The results suggest three periods of distinct palaeolimnological character: (i) low primary production combined with shifts between aerobic and anaerobic profundal conditions (prior to ca. 3000 BC), (ii) moderate rates of production combined with a relatively high profundal oxygen content (after ca. 1500 BC), and (iii), high production rates (460 g C m-2 a-1) combined with anaerobic profundal conditions (present eutrophic state). Corresponding organic carbon contents in the sediments are: up to 5 % (i), 4 % (ii), and 8 % (iii). Until the beginning of this century, the flux of autochthonous sediments to the lake floor correlated with the fluctuations in the allochthonous sediment accumulation rate, indicating that catchment erosion largely controlled lacustrine production during the Holocene history of Lake Lugano. Pollen data show catchment-vegetational transformations at ca. 3500 BC (change from fir to beech forests), al 1400 BC (onset of cereal vegetation) and at ca. A.D. 450 (strong increase in various cultural plants). The first two changes had a relatively large imprint on lacustrine sedimentation. At ca. 3500 BP, erosion increase in the catchment was triggered by vegetation changes in the mountain zone above ca. 1000 m a.s.l., which may have been induced by climatic and human alteration (drop in the treeline altitude). Maximum catchment erosion occurred at ca. 1400 BC which was clearly dominated by human cultivation during the Bronze Age. More oxygenated profundal conditions in the lake after ca. 3000 BC are possibly related to a better mixing of the lake waters during the winter season by increased wind activity.

Remote sensing of suspended sediment concentration and hydrologic connectivity in a complex wetland environment	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Maintaining the ecological diversity and hydrologic connectivity of freshwater delta systems depends on regular recharge of floodplains with river water, which can be difficult to observe on the ground. Rivers that form deltas often carry large amounts of suspended sediment, but floodplain lakes and wetlands usually have little sediment in suspension. Remote observation of high sediment water in lakes and wetlands therefore often indicates connectivity with the river network. In this study, we use daily 250-m MODIS imagery in band 1 (620-670 nm) and band 2 (841-876 nm) to monitor suspended sediment transport and, by proxy, hydrologic recharge in the Peace-Athabasca Delta, Canada. To identify an appropriate suspended sediment concentration (SSC)-reflectance model, we compare 31 published empirical equations using a field dataset containing 147 observations of SSC and in situ spectral reflectance. Results suggest potential for spatial transferability of such models, but success is contingent on the equation meeting certain criteria: 1) use of a near infrared band in combination with at least one visible band, 2) development based on SSCs similar to those in the observed region, and 3) a nonlinear form. Using a highly predictive SSC-reflectance model (Spearman's rho = 0.95), we develop a twelve-year time series of SSC in the westernmost end of Lake Athabasca, observe the timing and sources of major sediment flux events, and identify a threshold river discharge of similar to 1700 m(3)/s above which SSC in Lake Athabasca is clearly associated with flow in the Athabasca River. We also track the influx of Athabasca River water to floodplain lakes, and in three of the lakes identify distinct discharge thresholds (1040 m(3)/s, 1150 m(3)/s, and 1850 m(3)/s) which result in lake recharge. For each of these lakes, we find a statistically significant decline in the threshold exceedence frequency since 1970, suggesting less frequent recharge during the summer. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

During September 2003, a team of NASA NOAA and EPA researchers demonstrated a prototype tool for improving fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air quality forecasts using satellite aerosol observations. Daily forecast products were generated from a near-real-time fusion of multiple input data products, including aerosol optical depth (AOD) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)/Earth Observing System (EOS) instrument on the NASA Terra satellite, PM 2.5 concentration from over 300 state/local/national surface monitoring stations, meteorological fields from the NOAA/NCEP Eta Model, and fire locations from the NOAA/National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) Wildfire Automated Biomass Burning Algorithm (WFABBA) product. The products were disseminated via a Web interface to a small group of forecasters representing state and local air management agencies and the EPA. The MODIS data improved forecaster knowledge of synoptic-scale air pollution events, particularly over oceans and in regions devoid of surface monitors. Forecast trajectories initialized in regions of high AOD offered guidance for identifying potential episodes of poor air quality. The capability of this approach was illustrated with a case study showing that aerosol resulting from wildfires in the northwestern United States and southwestern Canada is transported across the continent to influence air quality in the Great Lakes region a few days later. The timing of this demonstration was selected to help improve the accuracy of the EPAs AIRNow (www.epa.gov/airnow/) next-day PM2.5, air quality index forecast, which began on 1 October 2003. Based on the positive response from air quality managers and forecasters, this prototype was expanded and transitioned to an operational provider during the summer of 2004.

J	Nungesser, MK				Nungesser, MK			Modelling microtopography in boreal peatlands: hummocks and hollows	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Surface topography of boreal peatlands is frequently hummocky. The hummocks and hollows develop from the peat and remain stable over long periods of time, even while climate and other environmental conditions change. Processes leading to these stable surface forms have not been clearly understood. The HOllow-HUMmock (HOHUM) model provides an explanation of bog microtopography, resilience, and stability. It suggests that bog microtopography results from moss species properties interacting with the physical environment. HOHUM is a dynamic, process-based simulation model simulating biological and physical processes leading to hummocks, hollows, and pools in boreal peatlands. It consists of several interacting submodels that grow hummocks and hollows at a monthly time step. Climate is represented by long-term monthly means for a specific location. The hydrology submodel. calculates seasonal water table fluctuations relative to the peat surface. The vegetation submodel grows-Sphagnum mosses using climate and moisture information and generates litter input; and the peat submodel simulates species- and layer-specific peat decay and accumulation. The model tracks the total depth of the top peat layer (acrotelm) of bogs produced by three common species of Sphagnum mosses, one of which forms high hummocks, another forms lower or middle hummock layers, and the third produces hollows. Model results indicate that hummocks and hollows arise primarily from species differences expressed through different peat accumulation rates. Interactions among moisture, unique Sphagnum species characteristics, and decomposition rates ate responsible for maintenance and resilience of hummocks and hollows. Feedbacks between Sphagnum growth, decay, and moisture restrict peat accumulation over time, creating a stable equilibrium with local climate Within decades. These feedbacks appear responsible for the long-term maintenance of bog hummocks-and hollows and their adaptation to changing environmental conditions Model validation showed excellent agreement (within 2 cm) between predicted and measured heights of hummocks, hollows, and water table depths for North American and European sites, and successfully reproduced conditions not anticipated during model development. Sensitivity analyses indicate that the model is most sensitive to decomposition rates, Sphagnum production rates, peat bulk densities, and the effects of hummock ice retention into the spring. Simulations for 35 northern US and Canadian sites predict distinct bog surface microtopography: hummocks and hollows are well developed in the eastern and northeastern regions of North America-With-the highest hummocks in far northeastern Canada, north of which hummocks grade into low surface relief. In the high-latitude Canadian interior extreme arctic conditions (cold and dry) prevent bog formation. South of the Great Lakes, wet hollow species are replaced by more drought-resistant species to form relatively flat lawns. These simulated geographic patterns agree with those reported for North American peatlands. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Croke, JC; Magee, JW; Wallensky, EP				Croke, JC; Magee, JW; Wallensky, EP			The role of the Australian Monsoon in the western catchment of Lake Eyre, central Australia, during the Last Interglacial	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Relative changes in monsoon intensity can be deduced from palaeoenvironmental data such as lake level records, shore line features and aeolian/loess deflationary sequences. These data can provide assessments of past changes in the nature and timing of monsoon activity. The Lake Eyre basin (1,300,000 km(2)), in central Australia, is a key site for determining the nature and extent of monsoon fluctuations through glacial/interglacial cycles. A last interglacial high lake-level phase some time between 90-130 ka is confirmed by both palaeoenvironmental and computer simulated data. This coincides with a time of high sea level and strong orbital forcing of the Asian monsoon, the primary forcing mechanism for the north Australian monsoon. The large monsoon-fed river systems of the Cooper and Diamantina are likely to have contributed most of the inflow to fill this 'megalake' phase of Lake Eyre. Evidence from the Neales River suggests that these smaller and more southerly rivers were also active. This paper examines the likelihood that the relative synchroneity in fluvial and lacustrine activity across the basin at this time is the result of a common climate forcing mechanism. In examining the role of the monsoon in this western catchment of the lake we present two possible scenarios to explain enhanced fluvial activity during the last interglacial.

J	Tavast, E				Tavast, Elvi			Changing factors of the coasts of Lake Peipsi, North-Eastern Europe	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL					International Symposium of the FBQ on Pleistoncene and Holocene Paleoenvironment and Recent Processes Across NE Europe	MAY, 2007	Plateliai, LITHUANIA					Lake Peipsi is the fourth largest inland body of water in Europe. Its geological history was controlled by glacial retreat, climate and neotectonic movements. The lake depression has a key position between Russia, Estonia, Latvia and Finland for solving many principal problems related to the deglaciation history and neotectonical movements. The northern part of the meridionally elongated basin is now rising, the central part is stable and the southern part is sinking. These processes caused and are still causing the water to spread from north to south. The resultant flooding of large areas poses many ecological and social problems. Owing to considerable water-level fluctuations, exceeding 3 m, both the surface area and the Volume of the lake vary greatly. High-water levels cause remarkable damage on shores and pose a serious threat to the buildings and roads in the immediate vicinity of the lake. Extensive changes on the coast are also clue to the action of hummocky lake ice. Lake Peipsi has a variety of shores. Shore types are determined by the coastal topography and lithology of the initial rocks. Shoreline changes and beach erosion have been caused by several geological and hydrometeorological factors (tectonic movements, hardness of rocks, wind regime, wave action, ice-push, water-level fluctuations) and human activity. Warmer winters and concurrent increased cyclonic activity have had noticeable impacts on the lake coasts during last decades. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

The photosynthetic efficiencies of the mixotrophic ciliate Ophrydium naumanni and the autotrophic dinoflagellate Gymnodinium paradoxum were investigated using laboratory and field experiments in Lake Moreno Oeste (41degrees5'S and 71degrees33'W, 758 m a.s.l.), in the Nahuel Huapi System (North Patagonia, Argentina). 2. The effect of different underwater light intensities on net primary production (NPP) was assessed during one summer. Additionally, laboratory experiments were carried out to obtain photosynthesis-irradiance response curves for each species. 3. Ophrydium naumanni and G. paradoxum dominated the metalimnetic (30 m depth) deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) in the lake. 4. Despite these deep higher abundances, the cell-specific production of both species was higher at 10 m than at 30 m (DCM) depth. In addition, at 5 m depth, NPP was reduced by PAR + UV-A radiation. 5. Both species exhibited a positive NPP at very low irradiance but the mixotrophic ciliate was more efficient in exploiting the DCM irradiance level both in situ and at comparable light intensities in laboratory experiments. Light acclimatised O. naumanni showed a higher NPP at lower irradiances and photoinhibition at medium and high irradiances. 6. Under the strong wind-driven turbulence commonly found in Patagonian lakes, organisms cannot select their position in the epilimnetic water column and will be dragged to potentially harmful UV radiation levels. Thus, metalimnetic DCM colonisation by these two species represents a tradeoff between higher survival and lower cell-specific NPP.					; Balseiro, Esteban/Y-2743-2019	Balseiro, Esteban/0000-0002-5052-0587; Modenutti, Beatriz/0000-0002-8683-5679; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				FEB	2004	49	2					160	169		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.01169.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.01169.x													WOS:000188224600003

At around 7200 BP, a shallow lake or open-water wetland supported diverse aquatic macrophytes. The site had transformed initially into a richer fen with Carer, Comarum palustris, and Drepanocladus and later a poorer fen with Sphagnum which persisted until around 3000 BP. Fire may have been responsible for silt being blown onto the peatland, which changed the hydrological and geochemical conditions for development of the poor fen. Ice accretion led to an increase in the height of the centre of the polygon and expansion of Sphagnum peatland. O-18 values become progressively more enriched, which reflects more direct input of summer precipitation waters and less groundwater during this period. Finally, the peatland surface was elevated sufficiently to limit water and nutrient supply, thereby allowing Ericaceae and Betula to grow at the coring site. Fire burned the peatland surface and may have exaggerated the extremely slow rate of peat accumulation Fire may also be a factor in maintaining the open Larix dahurica forest in the region today, while climate may be contributing to reducing postfire regeneration. Fire and climate together may be controlling the character and composition of forests near tree line in the Lena River valley of this part of Siberia.

Algal communities shifted from the dominance of cyanobacteria and cryptophytes in the early Holocene, towards siliceous algae in the mid-Holocene and chlorophytes in the late Holocene. Algae responded to a combination of climate-mediated vegetation and soil development associated with allochthonous inputs of dissolved nutrients and organic matter, and sediment infilling. Decreases in Al, Pb, Cu and Zn from the early Holocene probably resulted from soil podsolization and the sequestration of these elements within soils. Changes in Mn and Fe were likely linked to redox condition in catchment soils and water column. Synchronous peaks in Ti, Ba, Ca, Sr, Na, K and Mg, median grain size and magnetic susceptibility coincided with the troughs in the chemical index of alteration, indicating that episodic cold events enhanced upland bedrock erosion and transported unleached and coarse detritus into the lake. These cold events broadly correlate with Holocene ice rafting events in the North Atlantic. Although the cold events altered the influx of minerogenic elements by regulating upland bedrock erosion, climate-mediated vegetation and soil development led to a muted impact on primary producers. Holocene algal community shifts were subtle, reflecting the relative abundance of P (derived from weathering) and N (derived from soils) throughout the record, with the most pronounced effects on the lake biota being benthic expansion which occurred in response to sediment infilling.

J	Hellstrom, T				Hellstrom, T			An empirical study of nitrogen dynamics in lakes	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												The parameters determining the annual balances of nitrogen (N) and the concentrations of total N in lakes were analyzed. This was carried out by the use of multiple regression analyses on data from a number of northern temperate lakes with a hydraulic detention time of 0.25 yr or more. The result indicated that the removal of N in a lake, which in most cases is dominated by denitrification, seems to be controlled by organic matter. If no major N fixation is taking place, the concentration of total N in the epilimnion during summer is proportional to the load of N and inversely proportional to the concentration of total P or chlorophyll a. For some lakes N fixation is taking place. The increase in total N due to N fixation was found to be proportional to the concentration of total P reduced by a fraction of the estimated N concentration without any fixation. For most lakes, the effect of N fixation is to balance the N content with the P content, which means that the algal biomass is limited by the P content. A ratio of the total concentrations N/P less than approximately 10 indicates a rate of denitrification exceeding the capacity of N fixation. N is not balanced with P, and the algae is controlled by N.																			1061-4303					JAN-FEB	1996	68	1					55	65		10.2175/106143096X127208	http://dx.doi.org/10.2175/106143096X127208													WOS:A1996TR06600008
J	Tadic, M; Filipovic, S				Tadic, Milena; Filipovic, Stanka			Basin Water Management in a Coastal Karst Area	POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES												The mediterranean's karst basin waters is the topic of this research paper. The aim of the research is to help protect the karst underground waters through wastewater management of the basin's area. The main difficulty for our research was a shortage of knowledge in the identification of the karst's hydrological system, such as in the case of a researched system where the system's inlet and outlet are not completely known and the whole system is only partially explained from hydrogeological and hydrological aspects. For the research spot we chose a particular karst basin. Municipial wastewaters are discharged into the basin without any purification and, after being held in the underground, they appear at the spring that supplies water for the biggest lake in the Balkans. Correlation data between low water and the characteristics of the basin (i.e. hydrological balance analysis data of specific capacity) do not exist. A series of hydro-chemical measurements at low water were undertaken in parallel at the inlet and the outlet in order to determine this correlation by an input-output balancing of pollutants' load calculating their mass flow. The hold time of pollutants in the underground karst water was determined by correlating the particular water quality indexes. Hold time amounts to 55 to 78 hours, depending primarily on the water ingredient features.

The chronology of this new varved sequence is established from layer counting of high-resolution images of thin sections. Radiometric dating (137Cs and 14C) validates the reliability of the varve chronology. Varve thickness is significantly correlated (r = 0.38) with the total precipitation recorded at the nearest weather station Goose A. The varve thickness series reveals high values during the 1050-1225 CE period, which corresponds to the Medieval Climate Anomaly, whereas the 15th-19th centuries, related to the Little Ice Age, shows low values. The teleconnections between several Goose A instrumental data series and some modes of climate variability such as the winter Greenland Blocking (negative North-Atlantic Oscillation) and the significant correlations between our varve thickness record and three other Northern Hemisphere high-resolution proxy records suggest that the Grand Lake record tracks North-Western Atlantic large-scale modes of hydroclimate variability over the past similar to 1500 years.

J	Gharib, J; Smith, A; Houser, C; Jiménez, MM				Gharib, Jenny; Smith, Alex; Houser, Chris; Jimenez, Myriam Martinez			Barrier breach recovery in a lacustrine environment: Role of sediment supply and shoreline development	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Barrier breaching in response to high water levels and storm activity is common in the Laurentian Great Lakes of North America. Lacustrine breach recovery depends on the availability and transport of sediment from both alongshore and offshore sources and interannual variations in water levels. The recovery of two barrier breaches along the east coast of Point Pelee foreland, located on the north shore of Lake Erie, was monitored during a period of record high-water levels between 2016 and 2022. Despite both breaches developing during the same period, the southern breach (East Beach, EB) started to recover and close despite increasing water levels, while the northern breach (Hillman Marsh, HM) did not recover even as water levels fell below pre-breach levels. The opposing responses and hysteresis curves of the breaches are associated with differences in the availability of sediment from adjacent shorelines due to varying degrees of human impacts at each site. The increased sediment supply from more natural and diffusive shorelines adjacent to EB allowed for breach recovery, whereas a limited sediment supply from the highly fortified shoreline at HM prohibited breach recovery. If barrier recovery or reformation further landward is not possible, sensitive marsh habitat critical to migratory birds will be exposed to increasing wave energy, particularly as the extent and duration of lake ice decreases with climate change.& COPY; 2023 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

J	Paul, JM; Saint-Louis, LJ; Cezilly, F				Paul, Jeffey M.; Saint-Louis, Lens J.; Cezilly, Frank			Commercialization, Voodoo Ritual, and Use of the Endangered Hispaniolan Slider, Trachemys decorata, in Haiti: Implications for Conservation	CHELONIAN CONSERVATION AND BIOLOGY												The Hispaniolan slider, Trachemys decorata (Barbour & Carr 1940), is a freshwater turtle of conservation interest, endemic to the island of Hispaniola. The species is currently threatened by habitat destruction, hybridization with invasive species, and commercial harvest. However, the consumption of the Hispaniolan slider by human populations has received little attention. During the winter of 2017-2018, we conducted a survey to document the commercial use of freshwater turtles at Trou Caiman, one of the major wetlands in Haiti, based on interviews with 72 people representative of the local community. The strong demand for freshwater turtles from people living around the lake was related to classical uses such as meat consumption, artisanal jewelry, or the pet trade, but also to more-peculiar ones such as cleaning of hand-dug water wells, voodoo ritual, and folk medicine. Our results illustrate the importance of considering the socio-cultural context for designing efficient conservation plans for T. decorata in Haiti. We particularly discuss the pros and cons of developing turtle farming, possibly in conjunction with rice agriculture, as a potential solution to preserve the integrity and future of T. decorata.
